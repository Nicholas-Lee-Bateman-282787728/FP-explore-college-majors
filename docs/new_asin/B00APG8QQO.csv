5464274,4,B00APG8QQO,This will stun most people and sets a stage for how much we accumulate in the form of waste.  Burning is not the solution and the plastic island in the ocean is a global creation since the source is from everywhere.,1368403200,2,215,4.2439024390243905
5464275,5,B00APG8QQO,"A movie that will awaken all of us to stop using one time plastic bottle to quench our thirst, and time start buying products with no plastic wrapping. An urgent call to convert to zero waste asap, with small changes such as carrying your own bag at the store. Splendid documentary by Jeremy Irons, and as always great music by Vangelis at the end of the movie.

Note: I watched this movie streaming at the official site of the movie: [...] so if you want to start zero waste now, I recommend you watch it online :)",1367712000,11,515,4.309278350515464
5464276,5,B00APG8QQO,"This is a great movie that helps explain how society is not properly dealing with the problem of waste disposal. The old methods of burning and burying our trash are unsustainable. It makes a great case for the Zero Waste movement. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about the environment or wants to do their part to protect the earth. Recycling is not the only key to achieving Zero Waste.  We must be thoughtful and follow through on avoidance of waste, diversion of waste, reuse of waste, and recycling of waste.
Jeremy irons does a good job in narrating, the score is great. Animations were good quality, and they covered many regions of the planet in the film.
It should be required viewing for all public officials and employees.
Great Job.",1367193600,3,753,4.661654135338346
5464307,3,B00APG8QQO,"The movie Trashed was pretty interesting to me in the fact that the amount of

plastic that we as consumers have introduced to the environment is staggering

and relatively unknown to most. I did not know until a couple of years ago

about the amount of plastic islands floating in the ocean until I

accidentally came across an article on the internet a couple of years back. The

movie was slow and hard to stay interested in for me for the most part due to

Jeremy Irons artrocious voice, I found that the longer the movie went on the

more I wanted someone else to be narrating the movie!

Unfortunately in todays society everyone is about convience and ease of use, and I for one wonder if we all

have too much of a consumerism mentality to give up the plastic. While the

narrators voice tore into my very soul within the first 10 minutes I pressed

on because I think the film brings to light an important topic that most never

think about. Lets face it though in todays developed countries trash is

something we ship away, and as they say out of sight, out of mind, and I

think this mentality is quickly contributing to a catatrosphe of massive

proportions.

I was unaware that plastic in the ocean attracts chemicals, pesticides, etc, so I am glad that film touches on

the plastic bonding with these harmful chemicals. I always see that it is not

recommended to eat a lot of salmon or tuna because of the mercury content, I

just never knew how the mercury was getting into the fish, and I was too lazy I

guess to look it up. It was also interesting to hear about how the incenerators

wind up producing blow off pieces of plastic which are small enough that no one

can see them, but these particles effect everything around us. These two
factors are important to know, so that we as a people can see that plastic is

everywhere and sometimes we cannot even see it.

5464308,5,B00APG8QQO,"The film Trashed is a Blenheim Films production, produced and directed by British filmmaker Candida Brady who also directed Madam and the Dying Swan. Staring the Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons and composed by Vangelis. Released in 2012, the film has touched many viewers hearts (including myself) over the time. The film showcases the heartless actions of trash disposal by humans and the catastrophic affects that it has on the planet and even on their selves.
Starting from the view of earth from space, the film shows how the earth looks flawless, clean and unharmed. However, accompanied by Jeremy and his crew team you are showed earths condition resulting from our trash disposal techniques.  The trip is initiated from a beach in Lebanon covered with mountains of trash up to 40 meters tall. Across the oceans that are contaminated with toxins and garbage all the way to Britain landfills. Throughout the trip Jeremy visits many countries to show how earth and its residents are affected by the trash that is floating in the oceans, buried underground or burned into extremely toxic small particles of ash that are now in the air that we breath. All the trash that we thought we got rid of with these techniques is eventually releasing its toxins. These toxins are headed straight to the residents of earth loaded with harmful diseases to take its revenge upon us after we unthoughtfully got rid of its origin (the garbage). People are sick with cancer more than ever before. Babies are born with deformations caused by the toxins that mothers are passing on. In the middle of the film, Jeremy shows Jars that contain deceased deformed babies in Vietnam. He also visits a medical care facility that takes care of them. Even though that these deformations were caused by the chemical weapons that the U.S military used in the war against Vietnam, but this is what is really happening in a smaller case to us as we dispose our trash in that style. Eventually, that would be the full picture if we did not put a stop to these methods. I could not imagine any human being with a pumping heart and a functional brain not being touched by this picture.
 I believe the film was at its best when it showed a polluted river in Indonesia. The river was filled with garbage and toxins. However, people living on the river banks continued to bath and drink from the rivers water. It was a disturbing scene to see people living in such horrible conditions. On the other, it was similar to populations of developed countries. Even though our rivers are not filled with trash and we don't drink brown nor gray water we still could suffer the same consequences. The film did a great job painting this picture for us. The Indonesians throw their trash in the river and drink its water directly even though they can see how contaminated the river is. But we on the other hand, we burn, bury and dump our trash. But guess where all the trash and its toxin end up in? Its in the air you breathe and the delicious steak you are having for dinner. The tiny toxic ash particles that our incinerators produce are diluted in the air and the clouds. This is causing acidic rains that is going to rain on us and the marine life. Moreover, these clouds and the toxins that are released in the ground from landfills are going into the plants. The planets will now contain toxins as well as the cows when they consume them as well as the humans when they consume the cows. Its all in our food chain.
The film shows some solutions into how we could stop this pollution. However, I wish more practical and detailed solutions were showed. Solutions that I can relate to and will seriously consider taking the first step at. Jeremey showed some green recycling facilities and green projects that prisons are working on. Thats all great and exciting but I would personally want to see more solutions on the personal level. Solutions such as the shop that does not offer plastic bags.
Even though the film lacked to show more practical solutions to offer the viewers, I think the film has succeeded to achieve its main purpose. It certainly touched the viewers and pushed them into thinking of how could they help and what the next step is. After watching this film, people would definitely consider taking action. I agree with one of the reviewers of the film on amazon.com when he states that This is scary to watch. Not a little bit scary, but very, very scary.. This is a scary movie, it doesnt show horrific clips filled with blood but it shows the horrific situation that earth and humans are in.
In conclusion, this is truly such a great film. It will definitely open your eyes into what is going around you and influence you into becoming more open-minded towards new green solutions. I recommend that you watch this film as it might impact your actions for the rest of your life. This movie will put you on the right road by ether having you to start recycling your paper or major in energy engineering to help build a green planet.",1418860800,2,5015,4.640044994375703

5464312,5,B00APG8QQO,"This is scary to watch.  Not a little bit scary, but very, very scary.  This is the Food, Inc. of waste and plastic is at it's core.  Watching this is a wake-up call to our throwaway society, but also a serious look at how the rest of the world handles it's trash (or not). We have created a toilet bowl out of out water, and it's getting worse.  After watching this, I no longer eat tuna, swordfish, or any larger seafood.  Whenever I see a story about fish populations falling, autism, the effects of using herbicides on plants and lawns, and a host of other problems, I see viewing this documentary as a very late wake-up call.  The amount of water on this planet has not changed since Earth was formed, but the last 50 years has changed the balance of what is in the water, and it's not good.  Scary, but very, VERY, necessary to watch.",1407888000,3,840,4.312101910828026

5464315,5,B00APG8QQO,This DVD is a must see for anyone who cares about our planet. It is frightening to see what we have done to our mother earth in the name of progress and the dollar.

Jeremy Irons does a good job conveying the urgent message that we must change our way of thinking and behaviors to save ourselves from the mess we created with our ""throw-away: mentality.

5464335,4,B00APG8QQO,"I bought this movie for my AP Environmental science class, and it is OK.  The movie travels around the world showing various waste disposal systems--landfills in UK, incinerators in Iceland, open dumps in several developing countries.  It also shows the problems with these methods as well as the consequences of our overall consumer-driven, disposable society.  However, it leaves the viewer (at least my students and myself) wanting more---better waste disposal options, actions to take, etc.  It does not end very hopefully---more matter-of-factly--- and left my students feeling almost hopeless.  However, I would recommend it.",1369872000,7,631,5.670212765957447

8555690,1,B00APG8QQO,"Left wing propaganda at it's worst. 'Agent Orange' is the least of Vietnam's problems. The people of Vietnam today live in one of the most corrupt and despotic regimes in the world, with one of the worst records in upholding basic human rights, as documented by several international agencies.  Laos and Cambodia are vassal states of Vietnam, and Hanoi has many powerful agents in each, with enormous influence on events there.  When the tanks of the North Vietnamese Army rolled into Saigon in 1975, the ""anti-war"" movement congratulated itself on facilitating that victory.  In the U.S. cultural media and academia, that same self-congratulatory mentality is reinforced despite the fact that more people were killed in the ten years following the North Vietnamese takeover of South Vietnam than in the preceding fifteen years of war.  Infant and maternal mortality doubled under Communist rule, and well over a million people went into concentration camps, some for up to 18 years.  Under the Saigon government, despite corruption and favoritism, there was a free press, with many publications thriving.  All that stopped dead in April '75.",1514419200,,1142,5.247252747252747

Jeremy Irons takes you to Vietnam and shows you, up close and personal, dead, deformed babies, floating in jars of preservatives. It gets worst.
