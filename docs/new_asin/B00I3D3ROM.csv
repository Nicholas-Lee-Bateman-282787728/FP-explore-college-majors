I think since a few cast members were out this season it was hard on some people but that is life, we see people come and we see people go, no different than real life.  I enjoy the new characters and still love the old ones.  Stella seems to be a gal that most gals I know would be proud to have as a friend and we love her predicaments she gets into.  And I can never say enough good things about Daddy!
This is a good show to watch if you like small town British shows with lots of charm and fun characters.  You don't need to see seasons 1 & 2 to enjoy this just on its own.",1441411200,,656,3.8656716417910446

Loved every minute & can't wait for season 4",1441065600,,127,4.521739130434782

8638608,3,B00I3D3ROM,"I enjoy the show, but this latest series is rather flat. We watched a few episodes, then I promptly forgot we even had this disk until I saw it in my list of purchases. The spunky, unusual, funny characters and events in this show are just starting to get a bit tired and predictable. I do highly recommend checking out season one and two, then maybe, if you're a big fan, go ahead and get this just to see where the characters go.",1424476800,,431,4.204819277108434
