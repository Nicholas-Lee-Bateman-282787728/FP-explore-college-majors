8653806,4,B0009F4Z0M,"This was a pretty good dvd. ive watched it like 4 times already.  The guy in the video installs 1 sub, a multi-channel amp, door component speakers, rear deck speakers, radio, and a cd changer in 1 car.  it is pretty detailed and tells why things should go that way.  he shows how to do it with only a couple tools.  i was satisfied with it and i feel confident enought to install this stuff myself.  he also builds and carpets a box for the sub and explains it all the way.  the only thing he didn't show was installing 2 subs or more and wiring them.  i first saw the dvd on caraudiohelp.com  and it lists everything it explains on the dvd on that site.",1148774400,,655,4.142857142857143
