1945694,1,B0000TSQUC,"Sometimes you find a worthwhile film or just a good time-killer in the various bargain bins around.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of those films.  This extremely poor rehash of Die Hard (with a total of 4 idiotic terrorists) is sunk by the ridiculous, out-of-control posturing performance of Karzis as the ""leader"" of the group.  Furie phones in his direction, collect.  Only for those whose idea of an action film is to see the bad guys endlessly blasting away at empty rooms like kitchens and cafeterias.  Also includes the inevitable ""good guy running in slow motion while something blows up behind him"" scene.  Watch this and you will feel like you were sent to detention.",1328659200,,677,4.894736842105263
1945695,4,B0000TSQUC,"""Detention"" is not a great movie. It is not within Dolph Lundgren's top ten, and it does not deserve this four-star rating by technical standards. It is, however, one of the most downright entertaining flicks Dolph has done since he got into the DTV game. It's reason enough why Lundgren and director Sidney Furie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Eagle/dp/0767827686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Eagle</a>) should've done more work together. Implausibility and all-around goofiness run amuck in a flick that really has no business receiving any kind of acclaim (including its nomination from the Canadian Directors Guild) but steals it anyway with sheer moxie and funtime temperament.

The story:  Special Forces operative-turned-high school teacher Sam Decker (Lundgren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>) expects to end his last day of employment by hosting an after-school detention session for a handful of delinquent youth, but when a gang of drug runners take over the school as the site of their villainous master plan, the children are put in danger and Sam must fight back.

This movie is filled with strange, strange characters. Dolph is presented as an upright sort of guy but thinks it's okay to make out with his secretary girlfriend in empty classrooms. The students are unruly to start with - escaping from detention through the ceiling of the classroom - but a couple of them are way too eager to take on the gun-wielding terrorists when they first realize they're under siege (this is before Dolph corrals them and all they have to fight with are knives). The villains themselves are led by a very odd duck (Alex Karzis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-in-Uniform/dp/B00004ZBGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man in Uniform</a>) and his femme fatale girlfriend with bubblegum-colored hair (Kata Dobo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rollerball/dp/B00003CXTD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rollerball</a>), both of whom occasionally cue classical music during their interactions to let you know how crazy they are. The movie is also filled with strange, strange scenarios and situations: the untrained schoolchildren mount surprisingly effective attacks against the criminals using papercutter blades, bows and arrows, and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B00008N6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>-style spike trap; Dolph outdoes them by crafting his own hand-driven tank; and at one point a bad guy mounts a motorcycle and chases a kid in a wheelchair (Dov Tiefenbach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Hours/dp/B000CGX7FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Hours</a>) through a hallway before crashing into the school's pool. The ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;in school"" premise really couldn't have been pulled off any more bombastically,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Soldiers/dp/B00006JMQ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Soldiers</a>&nbsp;considered.

The movie isn't an action masterpiece and the characters aren't all likeable, but the crazy setups and unpredictable nature of the film ensure that it's never uninteresting. Sidney Furie's direction helps a great deal: he's not the most distinctive director Lundgren's worked under, but he was definitely among the more talented ones when it came to maximizing limited resources and keeping a plot rolling so it never got old. Despite this one's many plot holes (e.g. was it really impossible for the kids to just break a window to get out?), its production values are sound enough to avoid any technical goofs and definitely make the production appear much richer than its $5 million budget. The action content is abundant, though limited to the weird kinds of scenarios I've described and a few shootouts, with next to no martial arts until one of the very last scenes. Amazingly, I don't mind this: the action-of-yesteryear feel is palpable even when no one is fighting, and what the scenes lack in traditional coolness they make up for in fervor and gusto.

It's very probable that my genuine enthusiasm for this film is not shared by many folks beyond this review board, but I need to stand by my convictions. ""Detention"" is just plain fun, a quality which Dolph's output lacked then and now. It's a movie better geared towards general action fans who can forget to be serious for a while (or drink a lot of beer while watching) instead of traditional Dolph enthusiasts, though they too ought to check this one out ahead of garbage that takes itself too seriously, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agent-Red/dp/B00013RC4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agent Red</a>.",1319414400,2,5116,6.607142857142857

I just watched the movie. From the word go, i realized its going to be scary as hell. Better then anything else out there. THIS IS REALLY SCARY FILM that is based on true facts. Great story, good looking actors, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Loved DC in the movie. (creapy to realize that he died right after doing this movie). I give it a 10+.

1945698,4,B0000TSQUC,"Detention is a movie where a veteran-turned-teacher is stuck watching four students in detention on his last day of work.  Also in the school after hours is a wheelchair bound student and one security guard.  Shortly after everyone is locked in, a band of drug smugglers break into the school and all hell breaks loose.  The students are running from their teacher, their teacher is running from the murderous drug smugglers, and soon the drug smugglers are running from their targets!  The students fight back using the school's archery equipment, while their teacher uses the school's metal shop to create a weapon capable of a decent amount of destruction, and time is running out with a bomb in the basement....Will the school still be standing on Monday?

1945699,3,B0000TSQUC,"Okay, I tend to like Dolph Lundgren movies. But that's because I pretty much know what it going to happen in each one. Too bad he comes off as a poor man's Steven Segal. Which says a lot since Segal seems to be heading in a downward spiral.

Lundgren stars as a high school teacher and ex Special Forces expert. About to leave his job, his boss assigns him one last job, taking care of detention. As if having to harness and take care of these malcontents from class, a group of supposed terrorists are in the process of taking over the school once all of the students, save for these, have left.

It turns out that these are not terrorists but a group of heavily armed thieves planning the heist of an armored car. Along with their machine guns they bring along a ton of explosives.

But there's more. It seems that this group of psychotic criminals is not alone. They have ties into the government. But Dolph isn't going to play that game. Instead, he does what he can to protect the students and once he thinks that's done, heads out to deal with these crooks one to one.

These sorts of movies feel more cookie cutter style the more they come out on video. Are they entertaining? In some ways. Are they original? Not nearly as much as they should be. But they do provide a momentary does of escape from the real world.

If you've seen one Dolph Lundgren movie then you know what to expect. Plenty of gunfire, fist fights and explosions. If that isn't your cup of tea then pass it by. But if the shelves seem a little empty at the video store and this is there, you might want to give it a try.",1205366400,2,1597,4.274834437086093
1945700,5,B0000TSQUC,"Dolph Lungren plays teacher Sam Decker in this action flick. He is about to quit his job but has one last detention class to watch. The rebellious students curse and sneak out of detention when some rather dangerous criminals take control of Hamilton High. Sam Decker (Lungren) and the students must team together against the criminals who appear to want to intercept a shipment of drugs that has been seized by the police. To make matters worse, there is a crooked cop who is helping the criminals not only obtain those drugs, but to kill anyone that may stand in their way!
Of course, there is some overacting with some of the criminals.
However, Lungren delivers another talented and highly entertaining performance in this action thriller. I rate this movie with 5 stars.
This is a must see for Dolph Lungren fans!!",1196553600,2,819,4.774647887323944
1945701,5,B0000TSQUC,"Dolph Lundgren has finally done it! He finally decided to school his enemies at, well, a school! Yes! A genius indeed, Dolphage played an ex-soldier named Sam Decker who taught at a less-than-continuation school where cussing is the only language the kids know and girls are pregnant everywhere. ""Detention"" is so bad, it's good! Stereotypes have never been used this much, but the director achieved major insult to teens. Decker wanted to quit since he finally realized that High School High was below him and that the kids stunk, but the principal demanded that he stay and watch one, final detention class. Pity. A group of maniacs who dressed like Billy Idol took over the school and 'locked down' the school property. Of course, the movie went into ""Under Siege"" mode and Decker became a one-man army. The children band together and unite! A girl goes into labor, a wheelchair bound teen goes into a flurry and manages to outrun a motorcycle, another boy lives his self-fulfilling prophecy of actually getting courage to fight back and the whole gang construct this metallic/spike/shield thingy and fight bad guys in the gym! What an extremely entertaining movie and Dolph Lordgren delivers high-caliber action once again. What a deity he is! Yes!

1945702,2,B0000TSQUC,"When did I see Dolph Lundgren at theater last time?  While watching ""Detention,"" I was only thinking about that.  At least I can say that ""Dentention"" is better than awful ""Agent Red"" ""Hidden Agenda"" or ""Jill the Ripper.""  But sorry, that does not mean that his new film is good.
""Detention"" is a typical kind of action film shot in Canada (by NU IMAGE), in which Dolph Lundgren stars as a history teacher Mr. Dekker, who is formerly a soldier fighting in Bosnia.  Back in America, he is considering retiring, fed up with teaching the students who do not listen.  So, today is the last day, and Dekker is in charge of the detention class when four terrorists led by Alex Karzis sneak into the school.
Yes, armed guys in school, but for what?  And the students with Dekker are trapped in the building (typical ""Die Hard"" situation""), and they have to fight against the baddies, but isn't that a school?  Can you just break the door or something?  If you thought the premise of ""Toy Soldiers"" is preposterous, ""Detention"" proves you are absolutely wrong.
Sidney J. Furie (""Iron Eagle"") is a veteran director who can proceed the whole thing at good speed, and I can say ""Detention"" is not boring.  But the lack of logic is painfully felt when you see the unbelievable reason for the terrorists' attack especially when some scenes momentarily remind us of the sad memory of the real-life shooting case in USA.  The actions themselves are not exciting at all, the best point being a motorcycle chasing a student in a wheelchair.
The characters are stereotyped ones though Dolph Lundgren's change of pace (shown playing a high school teacher) is not a bad idea.  Actually, his acting here is decent, if far from his best.  Still, when we see a pregnant girl (put on detention), and her getting into labor in the auditorium, we can no longer find credibility in the film.",1080691200,5,1864,4.666666666666667

8002795,4,B0000TSQUC,"This film is not as good as another Dolph Lundgren film that I saw that had much more action, but it did have lots of action and was pretty good. Dolph plays a soldier who saved some children in Bosnia, but was unable to save one young girl. This bothers him. He is now a teacher in an unruly school where no one wants to learn. He decides to quit since he is unable to accomplish anything. As a last assignment he is given the role to sit with the detention kids, kids who acted improperly in school. Almost everyone else left. Meanwhile, gangsters come to the school to use it as a place where they can pick up drugs. They did not expect anyone in the school except for the watchman, not an ex-soldier and detention kids. When they discover the left-overs, they try to kill them, and Dolph tries to help them.",1504656000,,811,4.2727272727272725

8002801,3,B0000TSQUC,"As I've written before about the acting bringing a movie down, so it goes again with this one.  Dolph Lundgren seems to always be the glue that holds the bad acting together for his co-stars.  He plays an ex-special forces guy who gets tired of fighting losing battles, so he looks for a more challenging/rewarding career...he turns to teaching.  He expects to be able to help students at an inner city school, wrought with gangs, using his skills as an ex-special forces guy, change the overall populace.  None of the students know his background, although several faculty and the security guard do.
Anyway, he gets stuck being the detention teacher before leaving the school for good (guess he realizes that's not the career change he had in mind), and quickly realizes that an outside drug deal is going down at the school that's only able to happen because of the dirty security cop.  The students and Dolph (Sam) spend the entire movie fighting off these drug pushers, who are the worst actors of all, and barely escape with their lives in the end.  There are many moments where Sam (Dolph) is able to use a plethora of survival skills that he acquired as a special forces guy. It's those moments that make the story believable, and in turn, save most of the students lives.  It's a pretty good story, minus the over-acting from the drug dealers and dirty security cop.  For the guys, plenty of action and survival scenes from Lundgren that are well played and believable.  For the ladies, plenty of eye-candy seeing Dolph from beginning to end in jeans, and being able to handle himself like only a real man can.  It's not a must see, but it's a good way to pass a couple of hours if you've got some free time on your hands.",1410566400,,1730,4.587662337662338
