8124678,5,B000FMGTSK,"This is a challenging film to watch - that is in any conventional sense of watching - you get tired of its meanderings, numb to its seeming digressive format, impatient with its secrets, evoked but not revealed. But even as your conventional self is complaining and making this list of discontents, your imagination is floating freely in the wide spaces and claustrophobic corridors the director has created with unflagging originality and creativity. I doubt even he, the prodigiously gifted Raul Ruiz, could fully clarify its plot, its characters, its theme. Once he had finished directing and editing the film, Ruiz himself becomes another viewer, puzzled, impatient, curious. Such is the nature of this type of fiction, and my imagination, which is itself untrammeled like the narrative patterns of the storytelling. Imagine a structure  like THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER and a content like CHRISTABEL. with its ghosts, human fear and unreadiness. I feel with others scenes went on for too long, and there are long stretches of stories, related by or to the sailor, each of which has its own rhythm, length, import, pacing. In a sense, these stories are what the film is about, and the frame story is intentionally difficult to grasp. So we have a fascinating film which will require a variety of strategies on the part of the viewer. I've already watched it as a colorful crime caper, tonight I finished watching it over a two-day span as a medical case history, someday I will prime myself with wine and pursue the film as the fabled PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. And my highest wish is to view it as a metaphysical adventure.  Check with me in a couple of years and I might be able to tell you its gist. By then I'll have eloped with the lovely young woman with the dolls. She will whisper the film's theme into my metaphysical ear.",1437177600,3,1834,4.782334384858044
8124679,3,B000FMGTSK,"So, a few years ago I settled in to watch a film that proved to be such a rich and transformative experience for me that I was instantly invested in the films director.  That film was The Mysteries of Lisbon and that director was Raoul Ruiz.  Unfortunately, the bar was set so high with my first Ruiz film that each film Ive seen since has paled in comparison and proved a disappointment of sorts.  Granted, Ive only seen three films from the Portuguese director, and so I have a lot more to see and discover, but as of now Im afraid my expectations are too high.

Seriously, The Mysteries of Lisbon is such a masterpiece.

Three Crowns of the Sailor is an odd film that flirts with greatness in many parts and yet fails to really ground itself in something tangible, creating a film  that feels almost aloof, uneven or even unsure of what its trying to say and relate.  The narrative is an intriguing vantage point and yet not thoroughly constructed and so it winds up feeling more of a gimmicky distraction than a storytelling asset.

The basic premise is that of a sailor who encounters a student who recently murdered a man, and he offers to tell him his life story for three Danish crowns (krone).  His story is a tall tale of sorts, a story of a man trapped to servitude on a ghost ship that travels from continent to continent, and it is with each resting point that our sailor finds another story to tell, another tall tale to recount.  These stories are intriguing and at times visually captivating on their own and yet strung together they fail to carry much weight or make much of an impression.  They become lost in a narrative that never wholly connects them or makes them feel integral to the overall story and so we are left with loosely related episodes that capture our interest for a time but fade from memory rather quickly.  If this were a collection of short stories penned in literary form then I could see how one could be captivated by them, but they don't fit together properly and so, in cinematic form, they feel uneven and unimportant.

I wanted to love this, but it just didn't work for me.  The acting is fine enough, but nothing really noteworthy, and Ruizs direction is spotty at best, making impacts in parts but failing as a whole.  The real star here is the visual quality of the film, the grainy cinematography and the brilliant set designs (especially that creepy doll-cluttered whorehouse).

But as a story, this needed more work.",1430179200,,2468,4.549773755656108
8124680,2,B000FMGTSK,"If you are going to tell a story, please make sure there is some meaning to it all! ""Les trois couronnes du matelot"" (""Three Crowns of the Sailor"") from 1983 and directed by the much-celebrated and highly-overrated Raoul Ruiz (his ""L'hypoth&egrave;se du tableau vol&eacute;"" 1979 is a poor imitation of Alain Resnais' ""L'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re &agrave; Marienbad"" 1961), is with all due respect, such an example. By his own account: it was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"". However, it was completely devoid of that poem's profound allegorical significance. Mr. Ruiz's surreal tale was also of course a story of political exile (he fled to France from Chile, after the U.S. backed Pinochet, overthrew the democratically elected Salvador Allende in 1973), mixed-in with Latin American folklore. A sailor recounts his life-story to a student over a heavy night of drinking. He is seeking three crowns (coins?) that will make his life's journey complete. All told in flashbacks (that were very disjointed), like some awful dream. I had no problem with the overall subtext to the story, that much was evident and discernible. But where/what was the message and meaning to it all? Anyone who is well-versed in esoteric literature: can easily see through the amateurish pretentiousness employed by Raoul Ruiz (in this respect he was very much like: Alejandro Jodorowsky, Rafael Corkidi, and Fernando Arrabal). I have a real problem with so-called filmmakers (or any artist for that matter), that make allusions to: the Cabala, Freemasonry, Alchemy, etc., yet apparently have no concept or clue as to their true significance themselves! The 'three crowns', as I understand it, is the universal 'law of triplicity'. But where was the connection with this confused and absurd interpretation! What was his aim here? The story tried to make use of time displacement and illusion as a reality of reality, but not very convincingly. With a script that was pure mumbo-jumbo, where every line was a riddle within a riddle, that became redundant and tedious. If you're trying to tell me ""life is a riddle"", well gee, tell me something I don't already know! On a technical level the film was a complete mess (sound, sync, etc.). The reviewers: that raved about this monumental bore, are obviously not very intuitive or artistic, in the true sense of the word (ditto for Raoul Ruiz)! Raoul Ruiz (by his own account), was very much taken in by quantum physics, which would explain his lack or affinity for spiritual principles. If you like films that make no sense whatsoever, and are woven together like a jigsaw puzzle, then you might like this genuine absurdity! I have my own tastes, and I will not say something is good when it's apparently not, just to go along with the general consensus. The DVD picture quality was very good, the film was fully restored. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 117 mins. (BTW: The same can be said for all the films of Raoul Ruiz that I've seen.)

8124681,5,B000FMGTSK,"If Jan Potocki's fantastic 18th century novel A Manuscript Found in Saragossa -- a frame story within a frame story within a frame story - was recited over the course of a wine filled evening by a drunken sailor the result might conjure something of the  kaleidoscope of heavily tinted images, rambling narrative threads, outrageously inventive camera work, and bizarrely disjointed dialogue of Raoul Ruiz's Three Crowns of the Sailor (1983).

Only a few of Raoul Ruiz' hundred plus films (he's still churning them out) are available in the US.  I'm thankful that Three Crowns was chosen since it's definitely a worthwhile but challenging cinematic experience.  In addition, Raoul Ruiz -- a Chilean director who went into exile in France in the 70s -- combines the French New Wave's drive for experimentation (think Last Year at Marienbad) with what I assume are South American legends about the ship of the dead.  Ruiz manipulates and creates elaborate pastiches of the classic ""exotic"" ports-of-call tropes...

Raoul Ruiz's films are often dismissed as empty pretensions -- The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1979) is a notorious example.  His films are polarizing and often more interesting to talk about afterwards than to watch.  However, unlike The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting which gets somewhat bogged down in strange academic conversations about esoteric topics that BOTH the audience AND the film's narrator dismiss AS empty pretensions, The Crowns is so visually inventive and unusually plotted that the viewer is (or, at least I was) drawn (inexplicably?) into its grasp.

The Plot (with limited spoilers)

A ""plot"" might not be the right word but I'll give it a try.  A sailor encounters a night traveler and decides that over the course of a alcohol filled to tell his story -- a series of stories and stories within stories.  And the stories he tells about his vessel and its meandering voyages across the oceans from continent to continent!  Stories about a beautiful prostitute in a room filled with hanging dolls, sailors whose bodies exude strange worms which metamorphosis into butterflies and kill birds with their poisons, his mother hiding in the hold of this ship, of the captain murmuring/singing/whispering Ode to Joy with every breath, matching tattooed letters, prison in Tangier, about a murder (s), three Danish crowns, the passage way where the free masons once controlled the world beneath the fountain where Jesuits drown their sons...  Despite the delightfully fractured manner of the narrative there is eventually resolution -- although, it is somewhat forced and abrupt.  However, the pure off the wall qualities of the experience make this a rather unimportant flaw.

Final Thoughts

This is bound to be either hated or loved.  The pure imaginative exuberance is to be marveled at.  The technical mastery, the startling camera work, the strange tinted images, the unusual characters are all fascinating.  One gets the feeling the ""plot"" is only there to reign in Ruiz's more outrageous tendencies.  One experiences the pure joy of story telling when watching Three Crowns.  I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy the esoteric fringes of the medium.  This is a marvelously inventive experience....",1290643200,6,3252,5.187739463601533
8124682,5,B000FMGTSK,"I liked this  almost as much as HYPOTHESIS OF THE STOLEN PAINTING and wish I very much need to make the time to watch it again; it gets perhaps a wee bit long, but on the whole it is a wonderfully delirious pastiche of various themes and visual tropes from Orson Welles (most specifically LADY FROM SHANGHAI, MR. ARKADIN and towards the end, THE TRIAL), film noir generally, Sternberg's MACAO and other 40s-50s Hollywood-in-the-exotic-ports-of-call type pictures -- all filtered through Ruiz's wonderfully playful postmodern/magical realist sense of story. Like some of the features just preceding and succeeding it (HYPOTHESIS, ON TOP OF THE WHALE, CITY OF PIRATES) it is incredibly dense, self-serious on its face but self-mocking and amused when one delves deeper.

Most of the film consists of a sailor -- in many respects as naive and reckless as Welles' Michael O'Hara from SHANGHAI -- telling his life story -- or stories, of adventures at sea, femmes fatale, murders, and money, always lots and lots of money -- to a young man in a spectacular restaurant/ballroom in Antwerp (I think). It's really mind-boggling, but in a very different way from the two earlier films in the set, and in many ways it's a good film to set you up for Manoel dans l'le des merveilles. The photography, in particular the black and white segments (those set in ""present-day"", in Antwerp) is quite striking and is the work of the great French cinematography Sacha Vierny, who had worked with Buuel and Resnais among others, and went on to work with Greenaway. After seeing this early series of films, one can see that that -- like so many of the odd occurrences in so many early Ruiz films -- was no coincidence.

Available on this Facets single and also on an indispensable Blaq Out set along with HYPOTHESIS OF THE STOLEN PAINTING and SUSPENDED VOCATION.",1254009600,2,1841,4.856687898089172
8124683,5,B000FMGTSK,"Three crowns for a sailor is a dense, complex and multidimensional movie, due its poetic feature. It's besides, a mesmerizing voyage into the labyrinths of the memory, where livings, faces, facts, actions, personages fill the screen with a ceaseless and disturbing presence.

In the middle of a foggy night, a sailor meets a young student who recently murdered a man, that's why the loneliness and the guilty will shake hands, and just for the prize of three Danish crowns, this sailor will tell him his entire life. Evocation, despair, sharp reflections about the art, the life and the human condition will be part of this voyage around the world, where this nomade existence of sailor is carved in relief.

The tango is also, a silent actor with its brief cameos in crucial dialogues hovered by that dark could of nostalgy, hopeless and desperation. A ticket to get a chance to be in this ship, whose members are true phantoms, hungry to know the livings of this man.

But remember; if you want to be in that ship, you will have to kill a man, in order to deserve your right to be there.

A dense but memorable film, a glorious masterpiece in all the sense of the word.",1183420800,8,1171,4.615384615384615
8124684,5,B000FMGTSK,"I hadn't seen this film for several years, and Ruiz films are often hard to find, so the arrival of this DVD was a cause for celebration.  A metaphysical travel tale and a very different approach to narrative, in which everything connects perfectly but you're not quite sure how.  Also worth noting the amazing cinematography by Sacha Vierny.  In an age of fim-making by numbers, thank you Raul Ruiz for constantly surprising us.",1163116800,15,429,4.8493150684931505
