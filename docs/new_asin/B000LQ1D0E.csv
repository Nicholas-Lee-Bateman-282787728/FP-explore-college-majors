8163582,2,B000LQ1D0E,"I have a VHS copy of this film so my critique follows from watching that version.  The evil protagonist here, a Mormon slavenapper whose face writhes with Svengaliesque leers, is hard at work enrapturing the flower of anglican maidenhood in Manchester England into subservient trances,
and while in such a state whisking them off and over the pond for polygamous purposes in Utah.  The premise is absurd, the acting merely sufficient, and the direction and writing amateurish enough to ensure the viewer a few yuks if he is into bad movies.  It's fun for the first 15 minutes and then the interest threshold starts sliding to the lower latitudes, still, it's worth a watch just for the sheer uniqueness of this cinematic oddity.

One would have to do some research into early 20th century religous history to understand why anyone would bother to spend the time and money to make such a movie, but here you have it; an anti-Mormon propoganda drama.  You figure it out.

Unlike the previous reviewers here, I cannot take this movie seriously, and my viewing entertainment has been engendered by its utter inanity:  this is a cult movie of the very best/worst caliber.

Further words fail me.",1169078400,16,1190,4.856435643564357

This is one of the few surviving anti-Mormon films made during the teens and 1920s -- and it is well worth taking a look at.  Though the film is played straight, today it comes across as something quite hilarious. My suggestion to purchasers of this DVD would be to first watch the Extras. In about 25 minutes you'll get a brief over view of how the Mormon Church has been depicted on the screen from 1905 (Edison's A TRIP TO SALT LAKE CITY) to Richard Dutcher's 2005 masterpiece, STATES OF GRACE: GOD'S ARMY II and you'll learn a little about the IsoMike recording system used to capture the score for this edition. Next, watch the movie (and enjoy the extraordinary IsoMike recording of Blaine Gale at the restored Egyptian Theatre Pipe Organ in Ogden, Utah.) Then rewatch the film and listen to the outstanding commentary track by James D'Arc of Brigham Young University. After that, if you are so inclined, you can read Winifred Graham's very rare 1911 novel, ""The Love Story of a Mormon"", from which the film was faithfully adapted in 1922. That's right! the entire novel is included on this DVD and can easily be read. I highly recommend this DVD to silent film collectors and those interested in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). Grapevine Video of Arizona is to be congratulated on this fine release.",1166140800,12,1510,4.69811320754717
