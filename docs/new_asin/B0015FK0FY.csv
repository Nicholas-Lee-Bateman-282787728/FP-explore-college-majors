8258197,5,B0015FK0FY,"This is a brilliant comedy about a French working man who comes into a huge 1959 Oldsmobile convertible, fins and all. The contrast between his life and the ""beautiful American"" leads to one funny situation after another. A very quiet kind of humor, no bad guys, no sex, no destruction. Saw it first when I was 16 and  am so glad the DVD is now available. Only problem: in colloquial Parisian French, no subtitles. If you can handle that, buy it!",1471737600,,446,4.506172839506172
