8193299,2,B000PTYKUM,"* Spoiler alert (I guess) *

If you're expecting this to have a setting within ancient times, you're in for a disappointing surprise; when the freed prisoner emerges from the cave, he does so into a modern park--complete with cars...power transformers...buildings...joggers.  Couldn't the filmmakers have gone to an unpopulated area to film this part?  I realize that they used artistic license to insert this little `modern twist' into things, but it really wrecked the whole thing for me...

Also, the people in the cave were shown drinking what were apparently bottles of alcohol (???); not sure why that was necessary either...",1327363200,,631,5.217821782178218
8193300,1,B000PTYKUM,"While the professor's discussion of Plato's Allegory of the Cave was informative, it was like listening to a college lecture. The video example of Allegory was amateurish. The examples I found on YouTube created by college students were much more interesting....and FREE!",1289088000,,271,5.476190476190476

8193302,5,B000PTYKUM,"Out of a class of 40, 75% of my students voted for this dvd than the YouYube Orson Welles version.  The dvd has a depiction of life in the cave, and then discusses what Plato means by both out and inside of the cave, relating the experience to a religious experience, as Plato intends.  The Welles' version has an error that an external person takes people from the cave, when it is someone from inside the cave who becomes the first enlightened person.  Good explanation in the dvd, good comparisons drawn.  The person giving the discussion does say a couple of mild explitives when he gets engrossed in his discussion, ""damn it"" being the main one, which is unattractive to a professional dvd, but that is the only downside.  Otherwise, the philsophy is well done.",1247443200,2,766,4.644444444444445
8193303,1,B000PTYKUM,"The item, I suspect, may be enjoyable for some - but for me, it inappropriate for my purposes.  I prefer the older version which has Orson Wells' narration. I kept this one because it was not due to an error on the part of the vender - it was just my choice.  I did not feel justified in returning it.",1240185600,,301,4.0
