8720075,1,B00ZGIOMAU,"I woke up this morning, flipping through the movie channels, looking for something to watch. All the other movies were already in progress but Designer Pups was just about to start so I thought..... OK, I don't know what I was thinking. I have DVD's, Netflix, VHS tapes, etc, etc, etc. I could've been watching but instead, I watched Designer Pups. If I knew it was going to be that bad I would've (seriously) went back to sleep or something. As much as I (usually) avoid movies with talking animals, you think I would've known better. I imagine the only people that could actually enjoy this movie are toddlers or younger. I sat through this movie & still can't figure out why but at least I sat through it so now you don't have to unless you like or want to torture yourself. The 1 thing that keeps going through my mind is..... What was I thinking??? If you ever come across this movie, skip it",1473724800,,897,4.409638554216867
