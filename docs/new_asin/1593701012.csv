7799654,5,1593701012,Humorous and passionate discussion of fire service culture-the image we portray to ourselves and the public-the good stuff we should continue doing. Played it for a dept drill. It seemed to get the guys talking and hopefully will unite the older and younger members.,1419811200,,266,5.068181818181818
7799655,5,1593701012,"Rick Lasky gets it right during this keynote speech at the FDIC 2001 conference.  Firefighters who are not paving a path for themselves to contribute to the future of their departments should start laying the pavers now, and this is a great ""how to"" manual to do just that.  I enjoyed this, but the price was a little steep.  I paid it with the notion that the entire sum of the ""profits"" were going to a good cause in the fire service.  Am looking into the book next, because I am now entrigued as to what else this Chief Lasky can do for my employment.",1369440000,,554,4.247619047619048
