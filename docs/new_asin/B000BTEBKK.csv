8092242,4,B000BTEBKK,I just watched this movie on Youtube. My French is not the greatest so there are plenty of parts I'm left only to guess at - Does anyone know if the DVD sold on Amazon has english subtitles?,1304208000,,190,4.026315789473684
8092243,5,B000BTEBKK,Sophie Marceau is amazing.  The spirit of the movie is from the same place as France's fondness for too pretty unmacho pop songs and many colored macarons.,1165968000,,155,4.7407407407407405
8092244,4,B000BTEBKK,"This is based on a popular French romance novel by Alexandre Jardin. It is very French... stylish and psychological... tho very light-hearted at the same time. Fan Fan and Alexandre meet at a common friend's seaside inn. He is involved with someone else, she plays hard to get... teasingly. Lots of those French 'saying something while meaning the other and expecting the other to read it right' thing...

The leads are A-lists (at least in France anyhow). Sophie Marceau was the child star from the 'La Boum' films who gained international fame playing the French princess in Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart'... tho her other English film roles (Electra in the Bond film 'The World is Not Enough', the French cellist in the lame David Spade comedy 'Lost & Found') don't cater to her talents. Vincent Lopez has been around in English films too (Marius in 'Queen of the Damned', opposite Kim Basinger in 'I Dream of Africa', etc). These two are much more at home in French films tho, and this film is captures one of their very best performances.

A good nostalgic French film, really.",1155254400,,1077,4.816216216216216
8092245,4,B000BTEBKK,"This film is so magical and great, managing to squeeze in clowns, perfumes and a insecure man who fall for Sophie Marceau complicated yet lovingly character, Fan Fan.

A great french movie.",1131062400,,189,4.90625
