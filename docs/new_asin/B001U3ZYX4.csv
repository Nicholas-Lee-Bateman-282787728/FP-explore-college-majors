3796401,4,B001U3ZYX4,"Whose Line Is It Anyway? was and remains one of my all time television shows. However, I must be slightly skeptical about the approach taken here. As said in another review I read, what does this ""Best Of"" mean exactly for the future DVD releases of the franchise. First of all, I think Warner Bros got Season 1 all wrong by releasing two different volumes. The two volumes still didn't have all of the episodes from Season 1! I've been hopelessly waiting for Vol 3 of Season 1 to come out and this is the next best thing. They should have collaborated all of the Season 1 episodes and for ten bucks more, released a full season 1 uncensored with bonus footage and taken that approach.

That being said, it is what it is, and fans will now have to just wait and see what Warner decides to do. I give five stars for the show, but not too much credit on how they are handling their DVD releases. And plus, this DVD is missing the Robin Williams episode, one of my all time favs. I will still purchase this DVD though, but that's the trap of starting a DVD series collection I suppose.",1241654400,5,1082,4.303921568627451
3796402,2,B001U3ZYX4,"I used to be a Whose Line fan. Seen every episode more than once. Have all the other DVD releases. Heck, I'll get the (first) season two set if and when it's ultimately released. But the episodes on this set are shameful.

Firstly, I'm apparently in the minority when I consider the Richard Simmons show to be one of the worst ever. And I'm counting some of the really highbrow British shows from 1988. It's weird how scripted a show about off-the-cuff-iness has actually gotten.

The inclusion of special guests for cheap laughs is pretty much a middle finger to the other ""guest"" in the show - particularly Greg Proops. Were they included for ratings' sake? If so, it sure didn't help!

The episodes on this set were not that funny, in all honesty. They seemed to have chosen episodes with celebrity guests or shock humour. And quite a few episodes reuse the same joke three or four times in the same show.

Now, I completely understand the use of running gags or inside jokes. I have no problem with them being repeated here and there. But they were increasingly reused in lieu of an actual punchline.

This set is not without its positive marks though. Two of the episodes - 401 and 611 were very good. 611 did include a guest, bodybuilder Jane Tricker, but she was treated like an audience member, so it didn't distract from the usual precedings. And while 401 included a quirk for no reason but a reason to kiss everyone, the other games were quite memorable. Jeff Davis is awesome.

Included in this set is the ""Best Of"" special. It's also the only reason I would ever actually purchase this set. It aired on ABC twice. And only twice. And featured deleted and extended games from season two. It's a very good special, even though it also had moments like the ones I already complained about.

If kissing, gay jokes, and pointless cameos are your thing, by all means, pick this set up. Just, they're not *my* thing, so I can't rate this positively at all. Especially when it's just a ""best of"" set, and not a full season, or even a volume of a season.

Come on Warner Bros. Bring us season two. You know you want to!",1241049600,12,2123,4.496103896103896
3796403,4,B001U3ZYX4,"The episodes included are, for the most part, big time favorites of mine.  However, I hope this isn't a cop out for the studio to release a ""Best of"" and be done with it instead of releasing the rest of the seasons.  There are too many classic moments of this show which haven't been released yet and won't be in this set.  Still, I will be buying this one.  As a dedicated WLIIA fan, I can't pass it up.",1238630400,30,404,4.075949367088608

Highly recommended if you remember how great this show was and good for a lot of laughs.

""do do do do! i have no hair!"" that's right babay! i love it when u say that! my life may sound perfect...but guess who our neighbors are! THAT'S RIGHT! lorah hall and linda taylor!! ohhh how i despise those woman! -__- me and colin try and ignore their hideousness but it's so difficult!! but other than that, me and colin love our life and are very happy! we adopted drew as our son. he has no real talent other than giving out ""points""... that really don't mean anything. but whatever makes our wittle boy happy, makes us happy. just wish he'd loose some weight.... I'd like to talk about mikaela and ryan now. i think they make an...interesting couple. they have similar personalities, but the height difference has shown itself to be quite the challenge. but they love eachother very much and u can tell. me and colin have been best friends with them for years!! they practically helped raise drew!! Now my friend will speak...

My husband is Ryan Stiles.. We have lots of fun, he and I.  The problem is that he's sooooo tall! I'm only 4'1"" and he is 6'6""!  Quite a difference, eh?  I have to get on a stinking stepladdder to kiss him on the cheek!  But overall we've had a wonderful marriage... Except when Greg Proops tried to get me to run away with him to Mexico.  But that's all over now.  Chip Esten is another story... Wow, he's cute!  I try to keep it from Ryan because he's such a jealous man, but I know that one day he will find out. :/  But actually, I'm veryyy happy with Ry..  I would now like to speak on behalf of Madison and Colin's child Drew...  He really is a sweet boy, not very bright sometimes, but I love him anyway.  Colin and Madison don't give him a chance to show his true potential! Think of how glorious he would be as star of Geppetto!  But I'm sure that they will realize he's a great child once he's potty trained...  Trying to get a 500 pound child to go the bathroom in the bjorn potty is a difficult task...They get quite furious with him sometimes, and then Ryan and I have to interfere and tell them to stop slapping his bottom till it's blue!

She said what?????? we do not hit our baby!!!! drew drew is our life!! our blood courses through his veins...well we adopted him, but mediforically he has our blood. he isn't potty trained yet but we're letting him take his time. we don't wanna rush him. whenever he's ready...

Colin and Madison do try, and I give them credit...All parents do things differently...  I've never had children but whatever.

The End.

Mrs. Madison Mochrie

My only disappointment is that they seemed to select a number of episodes based on the fact that they had special guests.

3796598,4,B001U3ZYX4,"I've been fan of this show and it's outrageousness for a good many years.  I can't tell you how many times I've stayed up way later than I should, just to catch an episode in rerun.  I'm so glad that they've finally started putting them out on DVD.
This disc set contains my ALL TIME favorite episode.  The Richard Simmons episode.  I don't care how many times I've seen it, it effects me the exact same way everytime.
This is a must have for people who like to laugh and for people who have enjoyed the show.",1247270400,,509,4.216494845360825
3796599,5,B001U3ZYX4,The funniest video on the market today. When they say the best of they are not kidding. This is truly a classic. Each of the 10 episodes are certainly some of the funniest I've ever seen and left me in tears. If you need a good laugh this video will certainly tickle your funny bone and then some. AAA+++ for pure comedic insanity. It is uncensored so parental guidance is advised.,1246838400,5,381,4.380281690140845
3796600,4,B001U3ZYX4,"It's pretty disappointing that Warner Brothers has not decided to continue releasing ""Whose Line"" seasonally for the time being, a decision I (and many other fans I know) hope is temporary.  That said, the casual fan looking for a quick ten episode fix or a selection of episodes to show friends who have never seen the show will get what they need from this set.

Many classic episodes abound, and while the focus seems to be on special guest stars (the two best of which are Richard Simmons and Florence Henderson), there are also several classic spots with just the ""Whose Line"" regulars, such as the infamous episode of Party Quirks where Ryan has a close encounter with a neon light or Colin's break dance video with Wayne in Greatest Hits.  The inclusion of the hour-long ""Best of"" special is a nice little bonus, as it only aired twice, but it would have also been cool to see some more bloopers as featured in the first two volumes.  There also seems to be a lack of season two episodes...perhaps that set is in the works?  We can only hope.

In short, it's a worthy collection of episodes for a ""Best of Whose Line"" set, but the die-hard Whosers will still want to keep their fingers crossed for those seasonal releases.",1246752000,13,1229,4.5636363636363635
3796601,5,B001U3ZYX4,"I love the special guest stars that appear in this DVD.  You never know what's going to happen.  The outtakes are so funny you'll fall out of your chair!  Be sure to catch the show with Richard Simmons!  Absolutely wonderful!  Again, mature audiences only.",1246147200,4,256,4.7272727272727275
3796602,4,B001U3ZYX4,"I always enjoy watching WLIIA. I liked the first DVD releases and was looking forward to this last one. The episodes chosen for the latest Whose Line were pretty good. The episode with Colin not being able to distinguish genders is a personal favorite along with the Richard Simmons episode. In the previous releases there were outtakes included and that was the funniest part of those discs, so imagine my dismay when there were not any outtakes on the newest release. I was looking forward to seeing episodes that they had to censor and the only things that were different from the original airings were the removal of the bars from some the episodes. I was disappointed.",1246147200,7,673,4.760683760683761
3796603,4,B001U3ZYX4,"hmmm.... as with above sentiments, this better not be a cop out so that they don't have to release any more eps.... As with others, I bought the first 2 dvds and have been eagerly awaiting the next instalment. I also would have preferred them to release a box set of all Season 1 eps, then move on to Season 2, etc. I'd happily pay whatever was necessary to know that I had every ep of this incredible show. (especially since we were never lucky enough to get the whole series here in Australia).

Please don't be a copy out - please give us the whole series! Pleeeeeese!!",1243641600,4,572,4.296296296296297
3796604,4,B001U3ZYX4,"Other reviews have already told you what is coming out on this release.  Some have professed their love of the line-up while others have jeered and booed in ways that seemed to hint toward anarchy and rioting.  What all of them have in common though is a fear that this release might be a harbinger of doom for further season releases.  I admit, I briefly held that fear as well, but then I remembered something.  That something happens to be Night Court.  See, season one of Night Court was released in 2005.  Season two was not released until this past February, just five days shy of a full four years between the releases.  Warner seems to release these weird little collections as a way to test the market before committing to a project.

I am not sure if Warner Home Video has some madman at the controls who methodical sifts through all related materials in a quest to create the perfect release or they are just really lazy.  Either way, a complete season one is most likely on the way, to be followed by a complete season two (and so forth).  The real mystery here is how long are we going to have to wait?",1242864000,3,1115,4.3951219512195125

8342797,4,B001U3ZYX4,"I absolutely love this set! They overplay the notion of ""uncensored"", as there really wasn't that much cut out when the episodes initially aired. I'd expected something naughtier, but it's actually pretty tame--though the bonus hour-long episode does go into more R-rated territory than the half-hour ones. Aside from that, though, this is absolutely hilarious!",1494288000,,361,5.581818181818182
