2196656,5,B0006VXMLC,"Some of my fondest movie memories growing up are of this movie starring Tony Randall, Janet Leigh, and Richard Dreyfuss among others. You just can't beat the pure family fun and engaging songs from this film.

For years I have been contacting classic movie stations and video stores in hopes this would be released for a whole new generation to enjoy, but I thought it would never happen. When I recently found out it was really going to happen, I let out a scream of jubilation so loud it could have probably rivaled the biggest fans at the World Series or Super Bowl.

Glub Glub Glub - I have to go and watch it right now !!!",1128556800,9,627,4.35042735042735
2196657,4,B0006VXMLC,"This was one of those movies they played on T.V. every summer when I was a kid (could have sworn it was called 'the Glass Onion' or something like that).  A really fun movie.  I was told a few years ago that the movie had been lost forever, so I'm thrilled to see it available.",1126915200,3,277,4.0181818181818185
2196658,5,B0006VXMLC,"This is a great family movie.  I remember watching it when it first came out.  My kids loved watching in on TV years ago and my grandkids love watching the DVD that I recently bought.  It's got animals, music and good laughs.

2196662,3,B0006VXMLC,"What a fun movie! The concept of living in an underwater house is enough for a story, not to mention adding the top comedy actors of the day and super groovy 60's music ( little goldfish is my favorite ). This movie is good clean fun for the whole family. With plenty of action and laughs for everyone. This long lost classic will charm even today..",1109203200,12,349,4.303030303030303

2196694,4,B0006VXMLC,"There are brief shots of a destroyer as it tries to track down the underwater sounds produced by the rock band, and a few of maneuvers from various ships at the very end.

The interior of the ""green onion"" home is the major set. The exterior home prop seems slightly smaller, and maybe only large enough to accomodate separately the two mini-subs, one of which is the same as seen in Flipper.  We get more footage of the latter than the other, which my be more prop as it supposedly carries at least six people.

The mobile seabed HOD dredge must be a scale prop, with a studio interior.",1462147200,,587,4.36697247706422

2196696,5,B0006VXMLC,"I love this movie! I was telling my kids about it, and wanted to share this silliness with them!
See a young Richard Dreyfuss in a rockin' band! ;)
The mom (Janet Leigh) is all whiny, but that's what they felt moms in the '60's were like. Take that with a grain of salt, and enjoy the cool underwater home, and catchy tunes! The music won't leave my head!",1461283200,,355,4.159420289855072

2196698,4,B0006VXMLC,Hey,1459728000,,3,3.0
2196699,5,B0006VXMLC,I remember this movie from when I was a kid. I love it then and I still love it. Super doper cute movie.,1459728000,,104,3.5652173913043477
2196700,5,B0006VXMLC,One of my favorite movies! The kids loved it.,1459641600,,45,4.111111111111111

2196702,5,B0006VXMLC,Love the old movie.,1458172800,,19,4.0
2196713,5,B0006VXMLC,I have searched everywhere for this movie. Its one of my childhood memories of watching this movie & eating popcorn at a slumber party with friends. I watched it this time with my 5yr old granddaughter and she loved it as well.,1456617600,,227,4.428571428571429
2196714,5,B0006VXMLC,a great movie.  the whole family enjoyed it. Just as I  remembered seeing it as a child. Eleven year old grandson was captivated by it.,1455580800,,135,4.36
2196715,5,B0006VXMLC,"I was so excited when I accidentally came across this. Talk about going back down memory lane! I remember crushing on one of the band members....OMG! It was Richard Dreyfuss before he became famous! I thought he was sooo cute....lol. I think I was about 12 when this movie was released. I loved the silly song, too...Glub, Glub..Glub!

Alright, I admit, it's a silly movie about a family trying to live in a prototype home of the future under the sea. It's an idea to solve the overpopulated Earth and diminishing resources. The home is energy efficient and totally self sustained. It's ironic, now, how prophetic this movie was. Especially in the time period it was made. It's almost as if Walt Disney could see into the future and was thinking.....""what if....""  Of course, I wasn't thinking about those things....only how cute that guy in the band was...lol

Honestly, I don't think this was a hugely successful movie for a Disney movie. I think I was the only one of  my group of friends who truly enjoyed this movie and the song. I vaguely recall my friends teasing me. I didn't care. I enjoyed it.  So watch this movie and have fun seeing Janet Leigh as the mother and Tony Randall as the scientist father. It's such a typical sixties style movie with the typical band (dubbed music by a ""real"" band) and helpless pretty blonde, all wearing the mod clothes of the period. It's definitely a fun silly movie and you don't need to worry about paying too closely to the plot. Just enjoy! Maybe even laugh, as I did, at this so called typical family, clothes and music. I still like the song Glub Glub ' Of course there's the song Little Goldfish, which is just as catchy and campy. These two songs will stick in your head for days.....lol....earworm warning

Feeling down? Try this movie. It should change your mood and bring a smile to your face. Enjoy!",1455408000,4,1856,4.59214501510574
2196716,5,B0006VXMLC,"I have loved this movie since I saw it when I was a kid :)  The songs in it are classic!  ""Glub!, Glub! Glub!  I'm floatin' on a sea of love!""
""Hey little goldfish, where you goin' to?  Pretty goldfish, let me swim along with you, hey little goldfish, we could have a whale of a time, mm mmm, put your fin in mine, mm mm""  So cute! :D  And Janet Leigh is so funny - who knew? :)",1455321600,4,378,3.721518987341772

2196749,5,B0006VXMLC,Loved it. Great nostalgic trip of a family living in an futuristic underwater home. Great movie starring a pre Odd couple Tony Randall! Look for Lou Wagner and Gary Tiger man who both previously guest starred on lost in space about another family living in a flying saucer home!,1395964800,,278,4.6938775510204085
2196750,5,B0006VXMLC,"Hilariously witty, adventurously funny and a bit late 60's groovy. Merv Griffin makes a cameo in this Ivan Tors (Flipper) produced classic. Jeff and Nancy Barry composed songs which was released as a soundtrack album. See one of Richard Dreyfus's earliest roles. One of Tony Randall's best works. 10/10 rating",1394582400,,309,5.2
2196751,5,B0006VXMLC,It's a fun watch.  Richard Dreyfus when he was starting out; Tony Randall & Janet Leigh are delightful.  An all-star cast!!,1391558400,,123,4.809523809523809

2196753,4,B0006VXMLC,"A good movie, especially with the talent of Tony Randall and so many other beloved actors!!!  Even a very young Richard Dreyfuss lends his talent here!  With its unique plot line, it will surely keep you involved, but unfortunately lacks a solid, compelling ending to the story.  Well worth time, just wish it went a little further to close the theatrical loop!",1389312000,,361,4.790322580645161

2196756,4,B0006VXMLC,"Hello Down There is a delight, the kind of movie that makes one nostalgic for the seemingly simpler days when it was made. The marvelously ridiculous premise is replete with implausible details like a dad who can instantly identify and fix any undersea problem to teenagers who can pilot a small sub just because they want to. Throw in actors like Roddy McDowell, Tony Randall and Janet Leigh, totally groovy tunes and a cameo by Merv Griffin and it should be perfect. It loses a star however, because of the lame Navy subplot (pun totally intended) and the fact that it really has no ending (I mean it - the movie has no ending). Otherwise it is a perfect diversion.",1386547200,,667,4.566666666666666

Even though the songs are definitely late 60's, I find them singing the songs as they play!  The movie starts out a little bit on the slow side, while the plot of the movie is filled out.  A research scientist, played by Tony Randall, builds an underwater home, and his family must stay in it for 30 days, or he loses his job.  The grandchildren who live close, have asked to watch this movie every time they come visit!",1383523200,,598,4.294642857142857

HOWEVER, upon arrival, I noticed a note on the exterior of the case that indicated that the DVD will only work in DVD 'players'.  NOT in equipment that also has the capability of recording, nor will it play in PC drives.  Since my only DVD player also has the capability to record onto DVD, this disc would not work.

I thank  you for the movie but will not be ordering any more from any where else except from Amazon.com.

2196766,5,B0006VXMLC,Tony Randall is super in this 50s movie and funny too.  It's a classic and should be in everyone's libruary,1362441600,,107,4.35

2196771,3,B0006VXMLC,"Research Scientist Fred Miller (Tony Randall) invents the underwater house of the future. His boss T.R. Hollister (Jim Backus) thinks it was a waste of money. So to save his job and commit to secrecy Fred convinces his ""typical"" family to live there for 30 days. And we know what happens when a typical family gets stuck together for 30 days anywhere.

The film is a tad dated and you have to slog through hockey parts. We hear sixties bubblegum. There is an exceptional amount of slapstick fuller. However it is fun to see actors before they were fully formed and those that are not with us anymore.

A partial list of actors:
Tony Randall
Janet Leigh
Jim Backus
Ken Berry
Charlotte Rae
Richard Dreyfuss
Arnold Stang
Harvey Lembeck - Beach Party (1963) - Eric Von Zipper

One day we may see a revival of Fluffy (1965) with Tony Randall, and Shirley Jones.

2196772,5,B0006VXMLC,"I loved this movie when I was a kid but remembered very little about it. I love it even more now! The songs in it are catchy and fun. The styles from the early 70s are so cool and the decor is a riot! The underwater shots are quite good for the time. Tony Randall is charming as ever, as is Roddy McDowall, but seeing a very young Richard Dreyfuss as a singer/songwriter/bass player in purple pants is a hoot! (I believe this was his first movie to contain sharks!!) You will recognize quite a few faces in this movie.

My daughter and I watched it when she was a child, and fell in love with it, too.  She is now almost 30.  I not only bought myself a copy, but her as well.

I never understood why this wasn't played more, because the stars are a surprise - especially Richard Dreyfuss as the teenage boyfriend, and wannabe band star - all under the ocean!

2196782,4,B0006VXMLC,"I think I was 7 or 8 when I saw this on TV in the early 70's.  The underwater ""Green Onion"" house was a cool to me then as any Bond villain's extravagant lair was to me when I got older and started watching Bond films.

This movie truly represents a unique time in 60's movie history when pretty much every film featured a group of young kids trying to form a rock band, though what passed for ""rock"" was more like ""beach pop"".

Richard Dreyfuss is in this one.  Turns out ""Jaws"" wasn't the first film to feature him in the ocean with sharks!

The transfer on this DVD is very crisp, clean, and bright.  No bonus features to speak of.

The film strains to fill out its 90-minute running time, but there still is no real ""ending"".  The Navy sends divers down to investigate the strange sounds and goings-on at the underwater house, but the film ends as soon as the divers hit the water.  It may not have been a necessary plot point, but it did add some production value to the film -- the footage of the Navy divers parachuting out of an airplane in their scuba suits was kind of fun to watch.

Janet Leigh co-stars.  I never realized how much she and daughter Jamie Lee Curtis looked like each other until now.

If for no other reason, watch this movie to see Richard Dreyfuss fake-play the bass guitar like a Rock God wanna-be.",1247097600,,1328,4.289156626506024

2196786,4,B0006VXMLC,"I first saw this movie as a child back in the 60's at my local movie theatre.  I was too young at the time to understand the concept - though the movie was the brainchild of Ivan Tors (Daktari, Zebra in the Kitchen, Flipper) I enjoyed looking at the underwater scenes.  However now I've located it, bought it and watched it, I enjoyed the movie for what it is -good light entertainment.  Tony Randall plays a architect/engineer who seizes upon the idea of building self sufficient homes underwater and builds (in secret) a home thats nicknamed 'the green onion' - Along with Janet Leigh as his very attractive (and albeit hydrophobic) wife and his 2 children (who ironically, are in a garage-type rock band seeking fame and fortune featuring a youthful Richard Dreyfus as their leader), Roddy McDowell as the music agent stoked on their with-it sound, Charlotte Ray (the housekeeper in Different Strokes) appears as their tonic-hooked housekeeper who's even more hip than the kids. We also have Ken Berry in a different role (as a baddie!!) looking to pillage the sea bed looking for gold - not to mention interfering with Tony Randall's quest to live in the green onion with his family for a month - proving its viability to his unscrupulous boss (Jim Backus). Following the usual plots of interference & sabbotage, danger (with real tiger sharks attacking the green onion following a garbage disposal mishap), and the kids being trapped in a submarine after sneaking out during a typhoon while trying to get to land to do a spot on the ""Merv Griffin' show (the film also features a cameo by the fabulous Mr Griffin).  The film is good clean American fun - no drugs (other than the tonic the housekeeper swills throughout), no real violence other than the risk of shark attack to Tony Randall  - in which he's gallantly rescued by 2 dolphins - Duke and Duchess - its all good!!! - the film is a little dated in some parts, however it appears to hold a great deal of relevance in that it promotes ecology and preservation of our more natural world, which is sadly what we really need today.",1211846400,2,2090,4.668478260869565

For those looking for serious fare, please go elsewhere, but for a breezy uncommitted afternoon, you could do a lot worse than a peek back into the 60's.  If kids can get past the dated feel, the story is pleasantly predictable, the music is fun... and they'll love the Green Onion. (""Dad, can WE live there?"")",1205193600,,588,4.59047619047619

Is it fun? By a boat load it's FUN!!! This film is forever trapped in its time but what a fantastic nugget of colorful late sixties optimism. Be sure and check out the music too. It's really a good time; although badly lipsynched. That's just adds to all the wacky, boisterous, frivolity of this great romp.

I bought this movie as a Christmas gift. It's fantastic to watch with a cold winter chill blasting the windows of a snow-trapped home. Oh, it's no shotgun wedding affair. More of a, ""let's get the family together"", kind of movie. The oldsters can remember it from their childhood, the kids can laugh at the wild fashion, (which keeps coming back), and everyone has a merry time.

I simply must point out the onscreen chemistry between dear Tony Randall and Janet Leigh. Who would have thought?!?!? They've got that special ""something"", which as an adult watching it now, I didn't notice as a kid. Back then I was too busy enjoying the animals, the scuba diving, the underwater house, the band and those too-hip-to-be-hip clothes.

2196793,3,B0006VXMLC,"HELLO DOWN THERE is a very cute comedy from 1969, with top performances from Tony Randall and Janet Leigh, who must have had a ball working on this.

Fred Miller (Tony Randall) is a wacky inventor who builds a house under the ocean.  His grumpy boss (Jim Backus) believes the entire project is a waste of company time and money, so Fred offers to have his family live in the house for 30 days.  There are only three major obstacles: Fred's ""aqua-phobe"" wife Vivian (Janet Leigh); and his two teenaged musician kids (Kay Cole and Gary Tigerman), who are on the verge of signing with a major record label.

This film is a breezy joy from beginning to end.  The house itself is very imaginative, and the underwater photography is amazing.  HELLO DOWN THERE was filmed in Florida at the studios of Ivan Tors Productions (famous for ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben""), allowing for lots of authentic location filming.

The cast also includes Charlotte Rae, Roddy McDowall, Ken Berry, Lee Meredith (Ulla in the original ""Producers""), Harvey Lembeck, and a teenaged Richard Dreyfuss.

Paramount's new DVD features a crisp anamorphic print which long-time fans will simply adore.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1180137600,23,1200,4.989949748743719

From the music, which you'll be humming for days after viewing, to the corny dialogue to the fabulous colors of the clothing and the sets, this is a gem not to be missed. I've watched it 4 times with friends and relatives and all had lot's of laughs at each viewing. Typical 60's situations, the father dealing with the boss at work. The wife trying to establish a career as a writer. The kids and their rock and their roll. Hee, hee! I recommend it to all who want a glimpse into life, however un-realistic, during simpler care-free times.

Enjoy!

2196802,4,B0006VXMLC,"After way too long this comedy classic is finally available.  Tony Randall has designed an underwater house.  His boss can not see its advantages and wants to scrap the project but Randall convinces him to let his family test it for a month first.  Two of Randall's kids are in a band so they invite the rest to join them.  Meanwhile Tony's boss is financing a self-contained underwater dredge in the hopes of finding lots of gold.

The two projects clash.  Randall's wife is afraid of water.  The band gets a chance to be on TV but can't leave the house.  On top of it all, the underwater rock music has convinced the Navy that there is Russian activity going on and the fleet mobilizes.  But despite sharks, lawsuits, seals, and even a hurricane, everyone manages to keep their heads above water.

I always loved this movie as a kid and I bought it as soon as I saw it.  Despite its age it has stood up well.  The record company uses a computer to predict hits in ways marketing computers are currently used.  A fine cast and some guest appearances certainly don't hurt.
