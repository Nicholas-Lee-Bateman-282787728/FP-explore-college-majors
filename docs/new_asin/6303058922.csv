7835634,5,6303058922,"I just love the old black and white Gunsmoke's. They start with what I call 'the sermon on the mount' where Marshall Dillon walks through the graves on boot hill and talks about what one minute in time can change the course of a man's life.  The Hot Spell makes you feel warm, you can feel the heat from the prairie through the TV.  I'm a long time fan of the Gunsmoke crew, and especially James Arness.  Great guy!",1028592000,4,415,4.227848101265823
7835635,4,6303058922,"Of the two episodes, ""Word of Honor"" is the best. DocAdams tries to save the life of a boy who has been shot while tryingto escape from kidnappers. When the boy dies, the kidnappers let Doc live, but threaten to kill him if he tells anyone who they are. Doc gives his ""word of honor"" that he will not. He decides to figure out a way to keep his word while setting a trap that will bring the killers to justice. To viewers primarily familiar with the later color episodes of ""Gunsmoke,"" Milburn Stone's portrayal of Doc will seem much more cratchety and ornery here, as he was playing the character the way he was written for the radio version. Claude Akins is good as the leader of the kidnap gang.
""Hot Spell"" stars John Dehner as a troublemaker who manages to antagonize one of Dodge City's most respectable citizens without actually stepping outside the law. This of course creates a problem for Matt Dillon. Not a bad episode, exploring the frequent ""Gunsmoke"" theme (at least in the B&W episodes) of ambiguity.",954028800,6,1015,4.582417582417582
