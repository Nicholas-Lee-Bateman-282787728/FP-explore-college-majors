8704697,4,B00U8BDQ8Y,"A fun disc if you like Boston Blackie or early TV shows, this disc does have a problem in that two episodes are mislabeled (and mislabeled everywhere -including YouTube and Archive.org - for some reason): ""Revenge"" is actually ""The Director's Dilemma"", and ""101 Blonde"" is actually ""Fall Guy"".

Other than that problem, it's a fun DVD. Several of the episodes have the mid-program bumpers featuring Andy at his newsstand welcoming viewers back to the show. No original commercials, and the video quality is on a par with the other Boston Blackie offerings from Oldies.com; i.e., they're made from second/third generation video sources, so if you don't actually need this disc for a specific reason, watch the sames shows in the same quality on YouTube.",1461283200,3,752,5.064516129032258

8704700,4,B00U8BDQ8Y,"The TV show was like I remembered it in the early 50's, black& white. The only problem with the dvd was on show #4 Death Does A Rhumba.
My disk player has a tough time reading a track or two and after numerous tries it finally gets by the glitch and continues to the end of the show. .",1439424000,3,285,3.847457627118644
