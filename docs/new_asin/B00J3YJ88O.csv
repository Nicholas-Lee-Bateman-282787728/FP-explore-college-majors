6332564,5,B00J3YJ88O,"I really liked this video.  It has some very good information in it.  At one point, the person doing the interviews in the video was interviewing some scholar, and the two of them decided that the worst thing in the world was for someone with just a little seminary Greek to try to translate the bible from the Greek.  That was one thing I really took exception to!!  I had 3 semesters of Biblical Greek, and a long history of excellent English grammar instruction, and I AM translating, and I CAN DO IT!!  It seems that on this point they contradicted themselves in saying that only advanced degreed scholars should ever attempt Greek.  But that is the very thing that all the New Versions they are criticizing do--they say that better scholars have come along and can translate the bible better!!!  So--if the interviewer doesn't want to bother to do anything with Greek and bible translating--that is his choice.  But he shouldn't TRASH those of us who do want to do it and ARE doing it!!  The state of the heart will always be the biggest issue in things of faith.  At any rate, besides this one little issue that I thought they were sort of jerks about--the rest of the video is really excellent.  They have some charts which show the differences between some of the ""versions"", so-called, and it just BLEW US AWAY to see what some of these ""versions"" said!!!  Also, I really thought that the speakers did a GREAT job of getting to the issues of why new ""versions"" do what they do, and what the agenda is and what a faithful response should be.  It has been a while since I watched it but I just know that I really liked it, and so did my husband.  Very good, very informative, very interesting.",1430092800,,1700,4.4772727272727275

Pastor Steven Anderson is amazing in how he lays out the truth and hammers lies and deceptions in his preaching.",1427673600,,271,4.551020408163265
6332566,5,B00J3YJ88O,This film has an amazing amount of resources such as footage including an interview with Dr James White exposing his ignorance of the true translation problems and history. This film is great for public audiences such as churches or Bible studies or groups searching out the Christian history of the Bible and why the King James Version is the most accurate. Once you discover the infection and the correction that the other versions have made based on Catholic dogma you will see the importance of the KJV in relation to God's promise to preserve his perfect word.,1426377600,,565,4.835051546391752
6332567,5,B00J3YJ88O,By far one of the best expository documentary on Bible perversions.  I learned quite a bit about the NKJV and its errors. The director pulls it all together and narrows down the reasons behind all these heretical Bibles.,1417910400,2,220,4.7894736842105265
6332568,1,B00J3YJ88O,"This DVD is nothing but lies from Satan himself.  While not all modern translations are good, the most conservative translations are and they're even better than the KJV!  The whole agenda behind stating the KJV is the only pure Word of God is to confuse people and keep them from giving their lives to Christ.  Those who have promoted this film are servants of Satan.  Here's what the Bible says in both the KJV & ESV:
KJV - 2 Corinthians 11:12-15 - 12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

ESV - 2 Corinthians 11:12-15 - 12 And what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

Don't be fooled by this film.  To call good modern translations ""evil"" is evil!",1416268800,,1534,4.496402877697841
6332569,1,B00J3YJ88O,"No, I have not seen this DVD... I don't need to.  Anyone who tries to convince you that Satan himself is trying to systematically make the Bible easier to read in order to bring about a new world order is deceived.  The KJV translation was intentionally compromised by order of your great King James.  Many words were stripped of their original meanings to satisfy the King's non-Protestant theology.  Two of those words are crucial to understand:  baptize and church.  James did not believe in emerging so the translators did not translate its meaning for fear of execution so they created an English version of the Greek baptism.  The word church is not in the original Greek because it is a transliteration of a German word, kirche, which came from the Latin, Circe,  meaning an 'arena.'. It is where we get the English word circus.  None of these words are remotely related to the Greek word 'ecclesia'. And if modern translations are bad, then please keep in mind that the KJV that you read is considerably different than the 1611 version, and has, itself, undergone  numerous revisions over the last 400 years since King James, (not God), ""authorized"" it.  To close, I'd suggest researching the personal sexual activities of KJ before proudly carrying around ""God's Word"" with someone else's name on the front cover.",1413331200,3,1322,4.883408071748879

This from someone with an earned masters degree in the Bible.

Many who work for publishers try to discredit this work to get you to purchase their new copyrighted Bibles.
I would stick with the old ways and the old Bibles like the King James or Geneva.

The modern versions run to the catholic manuscripts for their authority.
The Old Bibles use the tradition Hebrew and Greek texts.
The New Testament was written in Greek to Greeks and many of Paul's letters were addressed to Greek churches in Greek cities i.e. Ephesians, Thessalonians....et al.",1399075200,14,602,4.778846153846154

8647811,3,B00J3YJ88O,"I have not been able to actually SEE the film, but I listened to the audio version available through the website of Faithful Word Baptist Church. Pastor Steven L. Anderson and friends have created a movie entitled New World Order Bible Versions to expose some of the satanic content of modern bible perversions based on the corrupted modern Westcott-Hort critical text.
  My first comment about the movie is that it seems to be a direct plagiarism of the book New Age Bible Versions by Gail Riplinger. Listening to this movie (as well as other FWBC messages) and seeing Riplingers theses, I was led to the conclusion that Anderson was a big fan of Riplinger. It does seem beyond question that Riplinger has had some good influence on Anderson. After all, many things they say are very similar. But then I heard Anderson mildly criticize Riplinger in a sermon entitled Women Preachers. As you can guess, Anderson propagated the ridiculous myth that Riplinger is a female preacher. The problem lies in Andersons being a pro with the cons. He rarely mentions another persons name without criticism. This is not the attitude a Christian should have. Should error be exposed? Absolutely. But one should not be out to just attack the brethren for their faults. We all have them. We ought to seek to be uplifting and encouraging in everything we do.
  Again, New World Order Bible Versions leaves much to be desired. It contains clips from an interview Anderson conducted with James White, author of The King James Only Controversy. That book, I must say, is one of the silliest pieces of firewood kindling that I have ever seen (see my review: Joke Book of the Age!). On his Dividing Lie program later on, White commented on the movie and stated that everything textual about the information in the film had been easily refuted in the book, and that the NWOBV crew didn't even ATTEMPT to respond to anything in KJOC. White obviously has a big problem differentiating between refuting something and merely responding to it. You cannot refute truth, my friend. But I did indeed feel that the movie makers did not say much in answer to what White said in the movie.
  I think they shouldve tried to answer at least SOME of the things in KJOC. I understand that the simple, on-the-surface data ought to be definitive. But the sad truth is that it is not for many people. I have tried to reason with several people with the deeper research, and STILL get nothing but a cold shoulder. (Quite literally. Those I have talked with don't even TRY to answer what I tell them.) Anderson says, basically, If you don't get it by now, you're never gonna get it. That may be so in some cases, but not in others. The mind plagued by academia takes a little longer to heal than those nave laymens minds who have a movie like this as their first exposure to the issue. But it can be done. The very verse of scripture from which FWBC gets its name tells us that we should be able by sound doctrine BOTH to exhort and to CONVINCE the gainsayers (Titus 1:9). I say don't just show differences between translations; show WHY they are different and why they are inexcusable. Dont just tell; show. Document the claims you make. Show what kind of damned apostates were behind the critical text. Show the silly character of the manuscripts upon which they are based.
  (Another note that doesnt seem to fit anywhere else is that half of any FWBC film is usually clips from sermons already preached. This not only diminishes originality, but also gives the films an awkward style.)
  In short, this is nothing but a tiny, unprofessional version of New Age Bible Versions. Get Sam Gipps books on the bible version debate instead. Everyone knows the books are better than the movies anyway. Sure, maybe Gipp teaches weird dispensational nonsense. The fact is that he IS incorrect to differentiate between Christ and Messiah. But that doesnt make him a lost man. The KJV-only Baptists Anderson attacks are usually twice the KJV defender Anderson will ever be.",1436832000,,4022,4.716524216524217
8647812,2,B00J3YJ88O,"The documentary makes some good points that many modern translations are not very good. They spend most of their time on the NIV which I agree is a poor translation to say the least.

However, they spend the last 1/3rd of the documentary on the ""corruptions"" of the New King James Version Bible. Unfortunately, upon closer inspection, in really exposes the problems with the KJV rather then the NKJV. For instance, one ""corrupted"" text of the NKJV according to this documentary is found in Matthew 7:14. Here is how both versions of the bible render the passage.

Matthew 7:14  Because strait is the gate, and NARROW is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (KJV)
Matthew 7:14  ""Because narrow is the gate and DIFFICULT is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it. (NKJV)

The problem they had was the word differences that are in all CAPS. Their church has a problem with the NKJV translating that DIFFICULT. Unfortunately, I spent 5 minutes and I looked up every place in the Greek when that word is used. In the Strongs numbering it is G2346. This Greek word is used 10 times in the New Testament. Do you know how many times it is translated NARROW by the KJV translators, 1 time. In this passage only. Every other time it is translated into different English words. Let me show you the other nine times the KJV translators translated the word. I will put the word in BOLD:

Mark 3:9  And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should THRONG him.

2 Corinthians 1:6  And whether we be AFFLICTED, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.

2 Corinthians 4:8  We are TROUBLED on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;

2 Corinthians 7:5  For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were TROUBLED on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.

1 Thessalonians 3:4  For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should SUFFER TRIBULATION; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

2 Thessalonians 1:6  Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that TROUBLE you;

2 Thessalonians 1:7  And to you who are TROUBLED rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

1 Timothy 5:10  Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the AFFLICTED, if she have diligently followed every good work.

Hebrews 11:37  They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, AFFLICTED, tormented;
------------------------------
Now, you be the judge. Which translation is more accurate? Granted, I don't think either is as accurate as I would have liked, but the fact that the KJV translators did this shows that the accuracy is not very good.

I can give you more examples of this. Almost every problem they had with the NKJV, I went and looked it up and found similar findings to the one above. Don't get me wrong, the KJV is a good translation that I use regularly but I also use other reliable translations like the NKJV and NASB. Bottom line, there are problems with EVERY translation out there including the KJV, NKJV, NASB, NIV, ect. I am just tired of the KJV only people thinking that there are zero errors in the KJV which is simply not true. The translators had a very ""catholic"" agenda and it shows in much to their translation work.",1432425600,4,3738,4.6033182503770735
