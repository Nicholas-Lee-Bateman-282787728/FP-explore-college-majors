8428055,4,B004FN25WY,"Can't tell if the national geographic documentary reviews are a system error or a joke everyone is in on. I thought about playing along for a minute, but then I wanted to also make sure to let fans of distinctive horror movies know this movie is actually worth your time. In the first fifteen minutes, you might start to doubt whether this movie is worth finishing . . . the dialogue is not especially sharp. But as the movie progresses, its clear that what makes the movie so distinctive is the director's visual imagination. The last twenty to thirty minutes of the movie contain almost no dialogue at all. Seems influenced by things like early Jodorowsky and beat generation exoticism. These psychedelic qualities make the movie feels as though it were made two decades earlier, but in a good way.",1497139200,,800,4.7214285714285715
8428056,3,B004FN25WY,"This has nothing to do with National Geographic. It is a 60's style horror. supernatural film and not half bad.
Appearently Amazon has gotten a number of misplaced reviews here.",1496707200,,177,4.933333333333334
8428057,3,B004FN25WY,"I was looking for something a bit different. But, this is good. Sometimes the information is a bit longwinded for students. Great information. I think the film just needs to be updated a bit.",1484006400,,191,4.647058823529412
8428058,1,B004FN25WY,"The other reviews appear to be for a National Geographic documentary (with the same name?) on volcanoes

This is not that movie.

 It may have a plot but I'm not sure. It has some dialog which generally does not make much sense. There are long stretches where there is no dialog of any sort, just a series of flashbacks, nudity, and wailing along with the occasional volcanic eruption and a review of scenic places in Turkey including cave dwellings, waterfalls, caverns, and terraces which in reality are spread all over the country.",1480291200,,534,4.782608695652174

8428060,4,B004FN25WY,"I have always had a distinct liking for volcanoes. I think they are awesome in their displays. Having seen Mt. Pinatibu in action as well as Mt. Mayon and the Taal volcano, all in the Philippines, it's an awesome experience. Add to that, the fact that, as a member of a group, we climbed a volcano in Guatemala (near Antigua). To be able to look down the volcanos throat and see the molten lava bubbling away is awe inspiring. Although, this documentary does not include the ones I have mentioned, it does give you a documentary as only National Geographic knows how. Watch how awesome Nature can be and is. It is a great Documentary. Buy it and you will agree with me.",1415750400,,669,4.4471544715447155
8428061,5,B004FN25WY,"This outstanding video from National Geographic was one of the first comprehensive overviews of the science of plate tectonics.  Using examples from Iceland, Africa, Japan, California, and the Greek Island of Santorini, it presents a visually entertaining survey of tectonic science.  Many of the concepts have been updated and expanded but this is still a great introduction.  The participation of scientist Robert Ballard also helps move things along.",1338595200,,453,5.632352941176471
