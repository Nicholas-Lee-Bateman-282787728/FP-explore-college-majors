7917183,4,B00003CWHI,"This is DVD disk 4 of 4.
End of the ""Alternate World"" series.  Will the visitors do what they need to save their Alternative World? Can they find a way back to the magnificant World of El Hazard? Will the raunchy jokes keep getting worse?  Will Jinai get his deserving punishment?
Continuity Notes: El Hazard the ""Alternative World"" is the 3rd El Hazard series. The original ""Magnificent World"" is the best, so start out with that one. The ""Alternative World"" series is continuation of ""Magnificent World"" and is not part of the ""Wanderers"" series.
Cautions: This series is the most adult of any of the El Hazard series. Lots of sexual inuendo like a sitcom, but nothing really happens, until the last episode.  It mainly a ""fan service"" encore purification ritual with lesbian groping. Mostly harmless silliness, but some may wish to skip the last episode.",1007856000,4,857,4.8561643835616435
7917184,5,B00003CWHI,"This series has the potental to be my fave. I like its depth of storyline, even in this tape. The animation is awesome, and Mokoto is sexy ^_^ If you like fantasy-hero type anime, I highly recomend it. If I am not being clear  enough, I can't wait until I get my hands on the next episode... and I  definately want to see the entire series, and that is just based on this  first episode!",952905600,3,387,4.133333333333334
7917185,4,B00003CWHI,"First of all, I'd like to say that I would have given this five stars, if not for how it ended.  I won't give it away, but though it ends in true El-Hazard fashion (BTW, I will say that the ending hints at another  series,[duh!]^_^), there is something of a plot hole.  That coupled with  how quickly everything was wrapped up made me slightly disappointed.  However, with the excetption of these two factors, the ending wasn't that  bad.  Of course, the story, plot, and humor are still top-notch, and if you  are an avid El-Hazard fan, like me, you'd do well to get this one. I mean  after all, if you've been collecting the series so far, why stop at the  next to last volume?  And as for the final episode, it comes in as  something of an addendum to the series end, kind of like an apology for the  mediocre main ending of the series, if you ask me.  But oh, if it is an  apology, it's a darn good one!  This one kicks in all the cheap laughs and  ""romantic"" misunderstandings of the first OVA series.  As a  matter of fact, it takes place in a very familiar locale, to those who have  watched the original, and once you see where it is, you know that it will  be loads of fun and laughs galore!  So even though the ending needed  work, I'd strongly suggest this volume, if just for the final episode.  That one had me rolling, and -ah- blushing (you'll find out what I mean).  And all in all, Otaku like me know that El-Hazard is one of the best, and  it makes for an undoubtedly good (though could have been better) ending to  a great series.  I for one, have no regrets buying it, and I doubt anyone  looking for really good anime will either.",951955200,5,1651,4.235483870967742
7917186,2,B00003CWHI,"The original El Hazard had one of the most beautiful, touching endings that I've ever seen, animated or not.  The only words I could use to describe this ending without giving too much away is 'abrupt' and  'anti-climatic'.  Oh well.  You win some, you lose some.",949104000,2,263,4.6521739130434785
