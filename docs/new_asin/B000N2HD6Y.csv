Alice---- ummmm why did the story end that way.  didn't even add up

the call girl----reading other sites it tells what the dude was. IF you ask me that didn't even look like one.

2752806,1,B000N2HD6Y,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever see. Terrible acting combined with even worse stories. After watching this crap I felt like I had been cheated out of an hour and a half of my life. ANYONE WHO THINKS THIS WAS A GOOD OR EVEN DESCENT MOVIE NEEDS THEIR HEAD EXAMINED! One of the smartest things you can ever do in your life is not even waste your time and money on this garbage. The old man in the DVD extras that says something about this being the best Creepshow yet is either high on paint thinner, never seen the previous 2 Creepshows, or is a complete idiot. I feel it probably a mixure of the three. This movie plain sucks and gets a big, fat negative 5 stars!!!!!",1179532800,4,677,4.175572519083969
2752807,4,B000N2HD6Y,"Ok, so this film might not have had the best reviews from some of its viewers but I didn't think it was bad. It isn't one of my favorite movies but it is certainly worth watching. I personally had to watch the movie twice to catch everything. All of the plots sort of intertwine within each other. Your first time through you may not pick up some of the themes linking all five of the stories together. At least give the movie a rent. Then make your own judgment.",1179360000,7,463,4.213483146067416
2752808,1,B000N2HD6Y,"5 tales the overlap characters and places but really not any true central theme was probably done to be able to use the same actors and locations to save some money.  This is not horror, this is basic cable television movie horror.  I have seen every movie anthology and probably watched every episode of Tales From the Crypt, Alfred Hitchcock, The Hitcher, Chiller, etc. so I think I know what works and what does not.  I can deal with low budget stuff, I mean I still enjoy the original Outer Limits and Lost in Space, so the bad special effects didn't bother me.  The acting is terrible for the most part, and the direction is very straight forward and really does nothing for suspense or atmosphere in any way.  The major failing of this is the writing.  The stories just aren't any good.  No big twists or suprises.  It really felt like a high school creative writing class.  Some pretty good ideas that could be made into something with a lot of work and polish, but instead it was just shot without the rewrite.  Quick example with the first short story.  Why does the remote change her family?  Maybe I can get by without an explanation.  Why does it change her then?  Why did the crazy guy change her?  Why did he give the remote to her parents?  They try to set the girl up as spoiled, so maybe he didn't like her.  They never showed her being mean to him, so it is not well set up to why he would do this, and what is the ultimate point.  Bad story and bad acting does this in.  Skip it.",1179360000,30,1498,4.285714285714286
2752809,5,B000N2HD6Y,"I found this movie fun and campy...Very Original and cheesy Horror Some scary moments defintely fits in with the creepshow series. Do Not pay attetion to The Closed Minded Reviews............Rent First,Then Judge, This is Better New Horror.",1179273600,4,240,5.513513513513513
2752810,2,B000N2HD6Y,"Not nearly as bad as other people have claimed, it's still not a very good movie. I love the original, and have soft spots in my heart for ""Creepshow 2"", even though it's severely flawed. ""Creepshow III"", isn't a ""Creepshow"" movie. It's more like a Sci-Fi Channels original picture. Some of the stories make absolutely no sense whatsoever and are merely there to fill time. Out of the five stories, two were legitimately enjoyable - ""Professor Dayton's Wife"" (in an H.G. Lewis kind of way) and ""The Radio"" (actually had an E.C. comics ironic ending to it). This review probably sounds like it was written by a 10 year old kid, and that's how my brain feels after watching this. It's the cinematic equivalent of Taco Bell - somewhat tasty but ultimately not very good for you.

The Good - All the stories link together. Cheesy gore effects. The Creep actually appears at the end of the movie (for all of about 2 seconds).

The Bad - The acting. The very obvious Universal back-lot sets. The music does not fit the movie at all. Most stories make no sense and have non-endings. The TERRIBLE computer animation that introduces the first story.

The Worst - The title. This isn't ""Creepshow III"". This is more like ""Monsters: The Direct-to-DVD Motion Picture"".

If you were looking for a continuation of the horror comic series ""Creepshow"", keep looking. If you're looking to waste 99 minutes watching something that actually has a few bright spots, watch this movie. But, in the end, it comes down to two things: 1) The producers made this movie for one reason - to cash in on the brand name of the series, sell it to Warner Brothers, and earn themselves a producing credit on the upcoming remake of the original film (if it happens). 2) Warner Brothers got the rights back to a series that they shouldn't have dropped in the first place and can now make the remake of the original (or other inferior sequels).",1177459200,15,1907,4.649851632047477
2752811,1,B000N2HD6Y,"When I heard this was gonna be bad I didn't assume it was going to be terrible.  100% untrue to the originals.  Most of the stories just become corny.  Like the other review says they just don't explain anything.  To me these stories seem like the 90s versions of the Twilight Zones.  And the whole blending the stories together doesn't work at all.  Shows that tarentino actually has some talent when you see it done so bad.

So heres the worst news.  You HAVE to see this movie.  its that bad.  You just can't believe it until you see it.  I don't know what else to say.  if nothing else I got some laughs out of the movie.  But a horror movie this is not.

2752812,4,B000N2HD6Y,I got to see a sneak peek of Creepshow 3 at the American Film Market in 2006 and enjoyed every minute of it. I don't know why  everyone is getting upset that it was not done by Steven King or George Romero? Who cares!! If you like Creepshow 1 and 2 then you will like this. The five stories are good and if you like to see blood then you will love the one with the one with the two guys and the professors wife! The movie is fun and entertaining. The Creepshow franchise is one of my favorite horror series and this new installment falls in bloody beautifully. Don't knock it if you haven't seen it!,1173312000,6,599,4.119658119658119
2752813,1,B000N2HD6Y,"Why Warner Bros? You can't possibly need the money. Why bring this franchise back to life if you're not planning on giving it the justice it deserves?!? I knew the moment I saw the cover that this film wouldn't be worthy of the prior 2 installments, but decided to give it a chance anyway. Big mistake, absolutely nothing about this film works. You get a bunch of horrible stories that are supposed to be intertwined but wind up being nothing but a big train wreck instead. The stories themselves don't make any sense in the first place. They just leave you baffled in the end; & not in a good mysterious way, just WTF? For example, the first story involves a girl & her family. The father has just gotten some new universal remote that whenever he press's buttons the family (all except for the girl) change nationalities. Whenever this happens a chunk of the girl's body becomes all grossly disfigured & mutated. The movie never explains why or where (well I guess later in the movie it kinda explains where, kinda) the father got the remote, why the remote did what it did, or why the girl wasn't affected? This may not seem like a big deal, but once you watch the movie believe me it does, & the whole movie is like that. It's nothing but a bunch of inconsistent amateurish plotlines all mashed together to form one big horrible movie. Another thing about the movie is that it draaaaaaaaaaaaags on. Not necessarily due to the subject matter, but instead the pacing. You can tell this director is pure amateur hour. There's one scene in particular that comes to mind involving this lame mad scientists zany prank flashbacks. This scene went on, & on, & on, & on, just absolutely forever. Stuff like that plagues the movie from beginning to end. Anyway, nothing about the movie works, the acting is horrendous, bad effects (a combo of cartoony CGI & what looks like bright red watery corn syrup), & the story as I said before is lame; there's just nothing good to say about the movie. In addition, the gypsy with the crystal ball you see on the fancy drawn up cover, doesn't show up until the very, very, very end right before the credits role having absolutely nothing to do with the movie what so ever. This is not an homage, but rather a complete insult to all the original greats involved such as King, Romero & Savini. Stay away from this garbage at all costs.",1171497600,20,2367,4.5327102803738315

2752829,1,B000N2HD6Y,"Creepshow 3 lacks anything that could remotely make a film entertaining. There were no moral implications, there were no scary moments, there wasn't even enough gore to make it an entertaining splatter film. It has bland jokes, boring characters, and bad writing.

The film begins with the story of Alice (Stephanie Pettee), a teenager who finds out that the new universal remote control her father has is literally universal. It has strange powers and abilities to manipulate her surroundings but this newly discovered power spins out of control. The next story involves a part-time security guard named Jerry (A. J. Bowen), who lives in a nasty apartment building on the wrong side of town. When his radio breaks, he buys a new one for cheap off of a local homeless man. This radio somehow interacts with him and talks instead of broadcasting stations. He begins following the advice of the sultry voiced radio, but are the radio's commands going to help Jerry or lead him to his grave? The next story involves a reserved, even dorky man named Victor who meets a call girl Rachel, who is actually the notorious serial killer wanted by the police. This femme fatale soon discovers Victor is unlike most men as he has a monstrous secret. The next story involves two former students of a researcher named Professor Dayton who pay him a visit as he is soon planning on marrying his fiance. It turns out his fiance acts in a bizarre fashion and they suspect her of being a robot. The final story involves a vulgar and cruel doctor who works at a free clinic. He inadvertently kills a homeless man as he gives him a hazardous hot dog he dropped onto the sidewalk. This man's ghost visits the not-so good doctor.

This movie is poorly conceived and executed and it shows. The stories either stink from beginning to end or end up going nowhere. To be fair, I think the second story about the radio with sapience actually has a solid plot and is a decent segment; it might have even made a good movie on its own. Unfortunately, it is surrounded by uninspired horror and fantasy stories and the script, production, acting, and just about everything throughout the film are poor at best. Avoid this film and maybe consider the unofficial third Creepshow film instead,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-From-The-Darkside-The-Movie/dp/B0035JLW46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales From The Darkside: The Movie</a>.",1347926400,,2669,5.706030150753769
2752836,4,B000N2HD6Y,"Creepshow III does not have any real horror in the movie. It is light with irony and twists. The independent stories intertwine in a nice way to add to the humor. Okay, the special effects were not special. At the end of the first episode (mini-plot spoiler) a girl named Alice is changed into a white rabbit. I think the box description as ""merrily macabre fun"" is apt for the movie. There is no suspense or terror. It is a horror movie for people who don't like horror movies because they are too intense.

 PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, deals with prostitution and drugs. No nudity.",1343606400,,579,4.5576923076923075
2752837,2,B000N2HD6Y,"I grew up on Creepshow 1, which was 5 brief tales written by Steven King that threw you back to the horror comic book days. There was great suspense, erie 80s synth music, wild characters and creepy circumstnaces. Then the second movie had 3 tales of terror, written by King, but kind of dropped the horror comic book creepiness.

Well this movie throws creepy out the door and replaces it with corny and craziness. There are five tales that bait you in predictable ways then swerve you. They really bluntly lead you to believe the obvious. Instead of dropping hints they basically tell you what will happen... so they can swerve you and have something else happen that is still predictable. You may take note Steven King is no where to be found in the writing credits for this movie.

STORY 1 >> ALICE: This made no sense really. A girl wishes she were someplace else and her dad is playing with a remote that changes the family to different ethnicities. Then for no reason it changes her... This made no sense and it felt very twightlight zone and not very creepshow. Especially since it was all done on a bright and sunny day. This is thankfully kept brief.

STORY 2 >> THE RADIO: I actually liked this. A radio tells a man what to do. That's all I'll say. This felt like it dragged on a bit too long in the middle.

STORY 3 >> THE CALL GIRL: Uggg... This was predictable, because they bluntly lead you to think something would happen so something totally different could happen. I guess this was Creepshow-ish, but meh.

STORY 4 >> THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE: No one can believe the old professor has a hot wife. Really? This is another tale that bluntly leads you to believe something. So blunt that you know there will be a twist... a predictable twist. This would count as comedy in most movies.

STORY 5 >> THE HAUNTED DOG >> This is a great character piece. If anyone wants to know how to be a jerk, watch this tale of a doctor... a jerk of a doctor that lets a man die on the street. The creepiness factor was a 0.1 out of 100. The special effect of the bum's ghost was lame.

Where this movie stands out from any other is that all 5 of these stories exist in the same world, the same town at the same time. A character will appear in another story here and there. In all the movie seems low budget, not enough gore or creepiness to call itself Creepshow.

For me, the music really killed it. There was corny and silly music in the background of 90% of the movie instead of creepy music that made the first one so good. Also a lot of this movie takes place in the day. Why is that a complaint? Because the majority of Creepshow 1 and 2 were at night and it adds to the creepiness. Like you can either have a creepy killer in a rainstorm or you can have him out on a sunny day. You pick which one you'd rather see.

Overall, skip this movie and go see Creepshow 1 or if you've seen that dozens of times, seek out Creepshow 2 or Trilogy of Terror.",1334534400,,2949,4.280071813285458

The 2nd story is the best (about a lonely security guard who takes orders from his clock-radio, but not as well as he should.) 3rd about a killer prostitute is fun and creepy too. 4th is really campy (about a professor and his seemingly robotic wife) but not too funny, especially the ending. Last tale about an unethical doctor put me to sleep as it seemed to be going nowhere.

Yes, this is amateur and bites the Creepshow name to gain an audience. Overall, the good stories have the right amount of humor and horror and mystery. The bad ones are mostly pointless, over indulgent and really boring. The bookending character (not an actual story involving him) of the hot dog vendor is just gory and silly and reminds me how this movie did not follow the rhythm of any of the previous Creepshows or create one of it's own other than 5 stories strung together with no bridges and the aforementioned character bookending it.",1306195200,,1096,4.563451776649746

2752852,1,B000N2HD6Y,Creepshow III being the third sequel in the Creepshow series is a sequel in name only and one of the strangest movies that I have seen in a long time. The movie is divided into 5 segements that they try to tie together but the end result feels nothing but realistic. The movie also suffers from terrible acting (especially the part of Alice) and storylines that lead to deadends. The music sounds like they took it from some cheap compilation album or some guys/girls own basement recordings. The special effects look cheap and being that the movie was made 2006 one wonders how much this sorry excuse of a movie cost to make. 1/5.,1278374400,,631,4.543859649122807
2752853,3,B000N2HD6Y,"The third installment (if you want to call it that) in the Creepshow 3 is ruined by poor CGI. The end was one of the dumbest scenes in the history of modern horror.

Alice, a spoiled kid gets a remote and it changes her family. I missed something on this one actually but in the end she turns to a bunny.

The Radio was probably the best story on this dvd. It's probably because it didn't use CGI and the story was simple but effective.

Call Girl was a good story with some bad CGI effects.

The Professor's Wife made me laugh when they hacked up his wife. I know it sounds cruel and I may have given away the story but it was funny.

The last one I don't recall what it was called but it was pretty stupid and should have been cut from the final print. Again, the final scene is one of the worst cases of CGI.

2752856,1,B000N2HD6Y,"Quite honestly, if you're looking up this film, it's only because you have fond memories of the first two Creepshow films. However, ""Creepshow III"" is a sequel IN NAME ONLY to those first two films and lacks the involvement of both Stephen King and George A. Romero, both of whom made the first two films a success. ""Creepshow III"" is written and directed by nobodies and stars people you never heard of (except for Eileen Dietz - an actress whom only hardcore horror fans will recall as playing both ""Possessed Regan"" and ""The Face of Death"" from ""The Exorcist"" film.) As is typically associated with films of low-budget horror, the script is incoherent and the acting is wildly terrible and ""Creepshow III"" manages to deliver these traits in spades. The film isn't even in the realm of the so-bad-it's-good variety, but in the so-bad-you-wonder-who-could-have-possibly-funded-this-turd category. I could discuss the vignettes that pass for the bulk of this film, but really, why bother? The stories are so cliched, poorly written and completely devoid of any shock, horror, chills or competency that it defies even basic explanation. The sense of being underwhelmed permeates from this film at every possible point and you actually have to wonder why either King or Romero haven't begun legal action to remove this film from the collective conscience.

If you're one of those fans of horror who actually enjoy terrible movies, this movie still isn't up your alley. It's a total waste of time. I was an idiot and bought it when I found out about it (since none of the video stores in my area carried it - which should have been my first clue because they'll carry any piece of crap horror movie). Literally, after watching it, I couldn't wait to have it out of my house and I immediately sold it to a resale shop (where, undoubtedly, some other poor sucker picked it up and hoped against all hope that it would be like the other two.)

For your own sake and sanity, do not buy this movie. Do not give these people money. Do not soil your fond (or whatever they may be) memories of Creepshow's 1 & 2. Do not endorse even more crappy, low-budget tales of cliched horror. Do not buy this movie just to have a laugh with your friends (because your friends will hate you and renounce their friendship with you.) Do not be fooled by the comic book cover thinking it has anything to do with the prior films.

Avoid this movie and, if you happen to be one of the persons involved in any way, shape or form with the making of this film: punch yourself in the face... really hard... and just keep on punching until you realize what you did. Then, punch yourself (really hard) some more so you never do this again because you are a terrible person.

Uh, ahem, I was wrong.

Instead of an anthology of horror or creepiness, this movie just tries to be weird.  And it does a bang-up job of it.  The first two films tied their stories together with the theme of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-book/dp/0452253802/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic book</a>.  This flick, however, tries to mush the stories together like ingredients in a gumbo.  If you pay close enough attention, you'll see bits and pieces of each story threading into each other.  Some of the clues and hints are even remarkably detailed and (in a few cases) hard to catch.

But just because a puzzle is complicated doesn't make it good.  The makers of CREEPSHOW III didn't know how to do scary, so they just went with bizarre.  Here, as best as possible, are the various stories of this installment:

""Alice"" -- The most incomprehensible, stupid, and poorly acted segment of the bunch.  In fact, it's amazing just how awful every aspect of this story is: the filming, directing, dialogue.  Ostensibly about a Universal Remote that ""controls everything,"" this part of the movie is well worth the time it would take to fast-forward through it.  Can't believe this was ever filmed.

""The Radio"" -- Lame-wad Jerry purchases a radio that is unnaturally concerned with his future well-being.  Interesting idea is ruined by dull plotting and an ending that makes some sense if you choose to twist your mind around it, but which is unrewarding and lame no matter how you look at it.  Features one of the most obnoxious street vendors I've ever seen on film.

""Call Girl"" -- A smug serial-killer prostitute meets up with a handsome client who is his own kind of dangerous.  Neat idea, but suffers from a case of, well, let's just say this segment doesn't have enough foreplay.

""The Professor's Wife"" -- One of the main characters to provide the movie with its connective tissue is the ""brilliant"" professor, who has invited some young graduates to his home to meet his fiance, a young but seemingly clueless (and gorgeous) blonde.  Is she for real?  Or is she just another of the professor's experiments?  Say hello to the most violent and yet dumbest (and silliest) of this film's stories.

""Haunted Dog"" -- In every one of these movies there's been a story about an inadvertent death, followed by a persistent haunting.  This version follows around the crass and selfish Dr. Farwell.  I think Farwell's  insensitivity and his pathetic bedside manner are meant to be funny, but it's tired and uninspired.  This segment (and the final wedding segment) combine elements of all the segments that came before, but still, it's all rather lame.",1235347200,,3090,5.517021276595744

Short Attention Span Summary (Skit by Skit):

1. A Valley Girl lives in some neighborhood somewhere and is talking to a friend and lamenting about how she wants to move. She goes into her house and her family is watching TV and talking. Her father then presses the remote control, and she is zapped to some other place where the family is black and having the same conversation. Then the same thing happens again with the black family. Then the same thing again with a Hispanic family. With the remote control of the Hispanic family, she becomes infested with some sort of sickness. Then a worse sickness. And then she finally is turned into a rabbit by the Weird Professor Next Door. RATING: WTF?

2. A man lives in a roach roost housing project and finds a radio that talks to him. It tells him where to find some money and then to kill a bunch of people. Eventually, he defies the radio and is killed by a man who was set on to him by the same radio voice that made the him kill the other characters. RATING: Moderately interesting.

3. The third skit is about a serial killing prostitute. After killing about 10 people, she goes to her 11th victim, but it turns out that he is  some sort of demon and kills her (along with 4 other people that he had killed that day). RATING: WTF?

4. Some students visit a professor and find that he has designed a wife that is a living robot. They are so curious, that they kill her and take her apart. Then they run away from the professor's house. RATING: WTF?

5. There is some obnoxious doctor that goes to a hot dog stand and drops his hot dog. He gives it to a homeless man who chokes to death on it. (We only found out later that he is a doctor that could have saved the man.) The homeless man's ghost follows him through the whole movie with disgusting hot dogs coming out of various orifices/ wounds in his body. Eventually the doctor has a heart attack and dies. RATING: WTF?

I'm just glad that I only spent about 5RMB on the movie. Dear reader, don't waste your time on this either.

As far as I'm concerned, you would do well to stay as far away from this garbage as possible.

2752865,2,B000N2HD6Y,"Whoever came up with the idea for this really is torn between what horror means, and what an episode of Goosebumps would be like if foul language was to be included.

The first tale was far from scary, yet far from horror at the same time. It could easily have been rated PG, and laughed at by 8 year olds.

Next the talking radio gag; Sorry, the acting and reality just take away from the plot of this thing. A radio that talks and tells him it's going to help him be rich, and he does not question it, try to figure out if it's a prank, someone on a CB radio, he just figures from the start it's real... sorry, i could not see past that and ignore it. The twist on the end made for a bit of gore, but I'm afraid they would have to cut out the coolest looking part of the movie, as well as all the un-needed cuss-words in it, to make it the perfect PG rated episode of Tales From The Crypt.

Then there is the hooker killer who gets her own from Baraka or whatever he is supposed to be. PG rated at most.

Then the weirdo scientists friend hacking up his bride to be, not only is it PG, it could probably work for the kind of comedy you would expect from say, ""Penn & Teller""

Then there is the Doctor you love to hate, and well... couldn't they have come up with something better... just a little bit better?... it was kind of funny watching his montage showing what a jerk he is to patients, but the delve into insanity was mediocre at most.

Overall, the only good things I say about it, the stories each tied into each other OK, yet, intentionally so not cleverly. I suppose none of it was boring, but the stories would end before they seemed to have begun, and I guess the image and effects aren't that bad.

It's the bad acting and script writing that make this movie fail. Nothing is scary or intense, and if they cut out a few words here and there and trimmed a bit of the low budget gore in a couple of areas, these would be a kids show like Goosebumps kind of thing, at most.

To give you an idea of this, Creep Show III makes Freddy's Nightmares look like pure gold entertainment.

2752866,2,B000N2HD6Y,"Creepshow III is the third movie in the ""Creepshow series, although it is only in name only. It is an unofficial sequel and, in no way, is involved with with the director, writer or production crew of any of the previous films. The film, as the original, consists of five new tales of light-hearted horror. They are:""Alice"", ""The Radio"", ""Call Girl"", ""The Professor's Wife"" & ""Haunted Dog"" with the EC Comics angle omitted this time around. ""Creepshow III"" takes the approach very similar to Quentin Tarantino's 1994 crime epic, ""Pulp Fiction"", in which characters from every story collide with one-another throughout the film. In this respect, it just doesn't feel like a ""Creepshow"" movie.

Standing alone, Creepshow III is decent enough for a movie but not up to the calibur set by George Romero and Stephen King. Taurus Entertainment have already announced another 'unofficial' sequel entitled ""Creepshow IV"", currently slated to go into production February of 2008. If you can get this in a bargain bin as well, by all means get it but don't pay full price for it. I can't recommend it otherwise.

I honestly don't see why some companies feel the need to continue franchises like these without the original crews input in some way. Fans will dismiss it as a failure from the get-go. At any rate, I'll leave this one up to your discretion.",1208736000,,1343,4.860262008733624
2752867,2,B000N2HD6Y,"I didn't expect much going into this film.  It was ""directed"" by James Dudelson and Ana Clavell, the filthy, uninspired hacks who somehow got their hands on a lot of George Romero properties and produced the unspeakbly awful DAY OF THE DEAD 2.  These two individuals should be stopped before they ""direct"" again.  They are as talentless as they are physically ugly.  With all that said, CREEPSHOW 3 was slightly better than I expected it to be.  It has a few decent moments (very few) but mostly the stories are incredibly stupid, poorly written and atrociously acted and directed.  Oddly, I didn't mind the animated portion of the film that everyone else is complaining about, and for all of it's obvious lack of budget, I thought the film itself looked okay.  There were a couple of decent gore effects as well, and the Call Girl/Vampire story was actually enjoyable (for me at least).  I also thought that the music score by Chris Anderson was acceptable (although not anywhere close to the scores composed by John Harrison, Rick Wakeman etc.).  CREEPSHOW 3  ends with the single worst CGI animation effect I have ever seen in a movie.  It looked like something I might come up with on my own computer after about five minutes of work.

What Taurus Entertainment and Dudelson and Clavell are doing with these rip-off sequals is simply obscene and should not be encouraged.  I bought my copy of CREEPSHOW 3 used simply so they wouldn't see a dime of my money.  I'm still holding a grudge from DAY OF THE DEAD 2.  They should truly be ashamed of themselves for bringing this blight into a wonderful little horror anthology series.  Of course the first two CREEPSHOW films still remain great classics, but it is so sad that CREEPSHOW 3 exists to put such a stigma on the series.  I see that a CREEPSHOW 4 is scheduled to shoot this year.  Let us hope that it can rise above the disaster that is CREEPSHOW 3.  Still, credit should be given where credit is due and not everything in this film is without merit.  The vampire sequence is pretty good, some of the gore effects are nice, the ""radio"" sequence isn't a complete failure but it goes on for far too long, the music score is decent and the film looks nice and bright with a few decent edits as well.

2752878,1,B000N2HD6Y,I saw this in the redbox at the local grocery store. I figured that the first two were pretty good and being a short story fan thought what the heck. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The stories lacked any type of direction and are poorly written. I'm glad I only lost a buck on this pathetic movie.,1185408000,2,306,4.293103448275862

2752880,1,B000N2HD6Y,"This movie so totally sucked that by the end of it I was just shaking my head in disbelief.

First major problem ... there were none of the animated interstitals. There was an introductory ""cartoon"" before the title sequence that looked like a crappy computer-generated Flash toon, though. The Creep himself was nowhere to be found.

The first story made very little sense. The second story was the best of the lot, but still left us shaking our heads in disbelief. The third story had an opportunity to be really good had it taken the expected turn (as soon as I thought I had it figured out we both said, ""Ahh, hey that's cool""), but when it went the same old plodding direction to its simple end, it just struck us as kind of dumb. Of the final stories, we felt like the last one was the worst of all -- far too drawn out, we just kept saying ""get on with it already.""

I'm by no means a harsh film critic -- I love Fulci and many forms of cheesy b-rate horror, but Crapshow III was so rife with characters doing things that nobody would ever do in a million f**king years -- not even in a bad horror movie -- and was such a disgrace to the franchise, that I can't find one redeeming thing to say about it.

As a sidenote, these same folks did Day of the Dead 2. It might be better than Crapshow III, but after what I went through last night, I'm not inclined to find out.",1184457600,2,1375,4.196969696969697

2752882,1,B000N2HD6Y,"The original Creepshow was a surprise smash thanks to the teaming of legendary horror director George Romero and author Stephen King.  Naturally, it spawned a sequel that ultimately failed to live up to the original, but it was nowhere near as bad as what we have here.  Creepshow 3 is the third entry in the series in name only, as it is brought to us by the same crew that brought us the direct to DVD Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.  Reading the previous sentence alone will tell you everything you need to know about Creepshow 3 in regards to checking it out, which if you were lucky enough not to see Day of the Dead 2, you should avoid this as well.  The only thing Creepshow 3 really has in common with the previous films are by featuring multiple stories that get tied together, along with some lame CGI-rendered comic book style frames here and there as well.  The acting throughout is horrible beyond belief, and saying that the stories themselves are lame is saying it lightly.  The gore effects stink, and the tepid, uninspired direction makes a guy like Uwe Boll look like Martin Scorsese.  Yes, it's that bad, and like Day of the Dead 2 before it, it's completely unnecessary as well.  I enjoy horror anthologies as much as the next horror fan, so let's hope the next time someone wants to make one that they have some kind of talent, and don't torture us with crud like this.

There is maybe ten minutes of total film where ANYTHING is happening worth seeing. Some funny things, some well done special effects and makeup. Not worth any more than a few bucks.

Contact Amazon on that and I want 10% of whatever they make.

Anyway, Crapshow (I won't put the '3' because it has nothing to do with the original Creepshow's) is not just a horrible cash-in movie-- It's just a horrible movie. Everything about it is bad. The script, direction, acting, setting, and special effects are bad. Usually when someone is making a movie this awful, they know it. Deep down, that filmmaker know that their work is a worthless turd. From that point a movie is usually beefed up with some good gore, interesting kills, some T&A-- You know, SOMETHING to distract you from just how terrible the film you're watching is. But this movie offers nothing.

I've seen some bad movies. I've seen the worst movies in the world, in fact, but every one of them had SOMETHING to talk about. A funny line of dialouge, a good kill, a budget SO sad it was laughable. This film has nothing. You're left with a disgustingly inept film which almost wants to punish you for watching it!

I think the movie depicts dark humor not horror but it's not funny at all. For example, in one scene, two of
the best students of a professor killed his bride by cutting her into pieces. It's because they thought
she was just a robot created by him. While doing this, they kept telling each other how her body parts looked so real!

This film is atrocious.  The acting is horrid and the stories are nonsensical.  Being the masochist that I am, I actually sat through the whole thing.  I almost turned it off when the story started with the doctor who was haunted by the street vagrant because he gave him, wait for it, a bad hot dog(I wish I was making this up).

8174135,4,B000N2HD6Y,"It took that third opus a long time to get out, twenty years mind you. Its nearly an afterthought: how can such two good successful films by Stephen King and George Romero be continued twenty years later? First because the period during which the title was controlled exclusively by the first author and director must have come to its end, liberating the title, otherwise it should have been attached to the original proprietors and paid for.

But it is hard to go back to the concept of these Creepshows and some changes have to be introduced. The very first change is that there is some continuity in the whole film because some actors and their roles go from one episode to the next or the one after the next. Some situations too are similar or even the same, not to speak of some objects like cars.

The next change is the style. This film really targets the grossest effects we can imagine. Gross is not necessarily bad but in this case it is done without much finesse and from gross we move to sickening and that is the lowest level in horror stories or movies according to Stephen King himself. And along that line the director does not hesitate to introduce human beings who suddenly turn into very monstrous beings that can resuscitate after having been killed, resuscitate to haunt a living drug-addicted doctor for example, etc.

And of course the concept of a mad scientist or technician is introduced with no real delicacy. The story of his wife  real or not real  Frankenstein or simple aging lustful old man  and how she ends up in a microwave oven is just plain funny. It was supposed to be a prank at first and it ran out to be a slaughterhouse scene with so much blood we just wonder if it is not half a dozen wives and not only one. And at the end the mad scientist marries her finally but this time it is so openly a recomposed body that there is no doubt at all any more. We are dealing with Doctor Frankenstein, middle name Lego, playing with body parts as if they were some press-in parts, pieces and pawns.

We definitely are not in a comic strip adventure for a young teenager, male preferably, but for some older teenagers, male as well as female, or whatever gender they may decide to have, trying to experience some disquieting experience that is supposed to make their stomach growl and their intestine dance some frantic tarantella from their waist to their groin, though it remains rather soft and bashful at this lower level.

Enjoy the film, but after a light dinner if you do not want to have some accident generally attributed to airsickness in a plane or road-sickness in a bus or a car. And be sure you take a sleeping pill afterwards to avoid all kinds of nightmares.

8174137,3,B000N2HD6Y,"The original Creepshow was a wonderful homage to the Entertaining Comics (EC) published in the 50s .  I watched this movie with my young nephews and nieces many times, and it never failed to entertain us all.  The music, the sound effects, and the visual effects all add up to satisfying entertainment that stands up to repeated viewership.  I had no trouble bestowing the grade of ""A+"" to this classic of the cinema.

Creepshow 2 was a step down in quality.  Yes, the stories were all based upon Stephen King tales as was the first movie.  However the spark that made the first an instant favorite of the genre was missing.  After watching this film, one is left with the feeling of, ""What is next on the agenda?""  Revisiting this film for repeated viewings is not what one thinks of as the credits roll.  I gave it a ""B-""

Creepshow 3 tried unsuccessfully to recapture and even surpass the original by trying to tie all of the stories together.  Instead the direction fails to surprise and shock the audience as the first movie skillfully did.  This is the kind of movie that would fit easily in the Chiller or SyFy channel schedules.  The substantial extras (for a low-budget movie of this kind) included in this DVD highlight the fact the intent of the filmmakers was to attempt to create a worthy entry in the franchise.  Their hearts were in the right place, but they failed.  Obviously this movie wasn't an attempt at a quick cash-in on the success of the previous movies as its 2006 release 24 years after the first and 19 years after the second can attest.  Those films set a standard the creators of this film failed to attain.  It's a real shame.  It's not horrible.  It's just mediocre.  I gave it a ""C"".",1487462400,,1716,4.527687296416938
