2924130,4,B000UR9TK0,"Got the video to help out my very visual ESL students reading Worrior's Don't Cry written by one of the Little Rock 9 Melba Patillo. I was under the impression that the video dealt more with the actual coverage of the events of the historic event but was surprised to see a lot of information on Little Rock's current situation and well lack of ""intergration"". Aside from this it is a handy tool to get the kids more involved in the book and start up some topics related to the book and current events. Overall not bad.",1268697600,3,519,4.360824742268041
2924131,3,B000UR9TK0,"It gave you an inside look on then (1957) into more recent times. This High School still has segragation to some degree. The majority of the ""white students"" get to drive to school in their own vehicles & have ""successful"" parents that did college & have career jobs (with the exception of a couple of black students), while the black students (on the other hand) are experiencing poverty, teenage pregnancy, abandoned homes in their residence, drug problems & parents who have to struggle to make ends meet.

One cant help but to wonder if the ""HISTORY"" of Little Rock plays a part in its outcome today. Back in the Racist South 1950's, White people denied black people of everything including the right to VOTE, & an EDUCATION. So you have illiterate black people in the 1950's, who were made out to be less than dirt on the ground. They were made to believe that ""White people"" were the ""cream of the crop"", & made to believe their best bet was to stay ""on the bottom"". The police department in the towns were all ""white"", the jury in the courts were all ""white"", the judges...(you guessed it) ALL WHITE-- 99% of the teachers ""ALL WHITE"" as well!

Were black people ever given total equal rights even when the laws were passed (primarily due to the Ammendments of the Constitution of the US)?..NO WAY! And you know what? This film is proof that RACISM still exists everywhere, but especially in THE SOUTH. Its a prime example that your hISTORY plays a huge part in your present day & future. The kids at that school cant help but to divide (white students with white & black students with black), because how can they RELATE with each other? HONESTLY! most of the white kids come from well off back grounds, while the black kids are not well off at all. The black kids have to get a yellow bus to school from their run down neighborhoods. White kids get their cars & drive to school, parking in the teachers parking lot. Its such ashame. How things can turn out even though the laws have changed over the years.",1266019200,2,2014,4.53021978021978

2924133,5,B000UR9TK0,Very powerful in and insightful representation of the events at Central in Little Rock and what has happened since.,1235001600,,115,5.105263157894737
2924134,4,B000UR9TK0,"I bought this video to coincide with my teaching the book ""Warriors Don't Cry"" by Melba Pattillo Beals. The information about the changes that have (and haven't) taken place at Little Rock Central High was very eye-opening. I enjoyed the contrasting viewpoints from one staff memember to the next regarding race and school performance. My students also formed a great understanding of the Little Rock community as seen by varying community members. The economic differences between races was particularly eye-opening.
The only complaint I have is that there was not much footage shown of Little Rock Central High throughout the years from 1957 to 2007. I would like to have seen more about the Little Rock Nine and students who followed, integrating the school in later years.",1229040000,10,776,5.118110236220472
8214411,5,B000UR9TK0,A must see for every American.  The producers of this documentary did something incredibly rare.  An objective look at the root causes for much of what needs to be addressed in today's world.,1501804800,,191,4.757575757575758

Separate but Equal is a excellent USH video for Brown v BOE / Plessy v. Ferg.
My students (low motivation students) were quite interested in following the Supreme Court ruling...  Long but worth it.",1449360000,2,317,6.348837209302325

8214416,5,B000UR9TK0,"Excellent video! I showed it to my students and we had great discussions. Many of the students were upset at the way the school were divided, but realized who should they be mad at! Really enjoyed it!!!",1414195200,,202,4.486486486486487
8214417,5,B000UR9TK0,We watched this in my Sociology class and I can honestly say it's the only movie I have ever actually went out to buy after watching it in school. It's a great film with wonderful camera work and directing. It's real. I love how the documentary gets both sides of view in more ways than one. I really feel like I understand so much more now about the lack of equality we still face in America and what I learned in this documentary I know I will always remember and continue to think about and try to incorporate the positive changes into every day life.,1338422400,3,554,4.285714285714286
8214418,4,B000UR9TK0,"I used this video to spark discussion at a teen meeting for girls. I thought more video of the original Little Rock incident would be included for shock value, however, the current Little Rock students provided enough information on education blockers for 21st century Afro-American teens. The participants enjoyed the film. The delivery was excellent, no problems.",1299456000,3,365,5.421052631578948

8214420,5,B000UR9TK0,"This film works perfectly for my college class on race and discrimination!  It highlights the question on the interaction between race and social class and structural discrimination.  For those who think the Civil Rights movement ended in the 1960's, this film is an eye-opener.",1288310400,2,278,5.295454545454546
