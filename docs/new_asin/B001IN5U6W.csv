That said, this is among the worst in ""how to"" videos of any sort. This would be a poor video even if a person was a black belt in Wing Chun, but it's even worse if you are hoping to learn Wing Chun... or anything for that matter. Master Choy is often blocking the camera during the very moves he's trying to teach. It's really too bad because the production quality is quite good, but the instruction, directing and choreography are all very poor. I'll be returning it if I can.",1357257600,2,616,4.228813559322034
8326513,1,B001IN5U6W,"If you are looking for instruction in wing chun, take a class from a qualified instructor. There are NO videos that contain adequate instruction and you are more likely to be mistaken about what you have learned and end up getting yourself hurt...",1294099200,2,247,4.767441860465116
8326514,1,B001IN5U6W,"these wing chun dvds are the worst ive bought. he goes way to fast he don't explain anything in detail or at all for that matter. i found michael wong on youtube and learned more in one hour than in all the years trying to figure out what william was doing on here. i definitely DONT recommend these dvds. waste of money and time.
i rated it 1 star only because i had too. it wouldnt let me rate it no stars.

8326515,2,B001IN5U6W,"Hey, if you are a martial arts lover and can stand to see some really bad story-telling and half-a**ed instruction, then please buy this product. It is not an instructional DVD in how to fight most Choy-Li-Fut practioners; it basically is just telling the story of him and Bruce Lee and how he fought in old time Fuoshan; and then shows you how he did it (sort of). I am not saying his skill is bad; just his instruction.",1235779200,7,421,4.341772151898734
