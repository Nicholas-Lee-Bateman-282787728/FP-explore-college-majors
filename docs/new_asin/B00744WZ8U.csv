5053678,5,B00744WZ8U,"I have seen this film twice and both times I walked away feeling horrified by what our government is doing and inspired to do more to protect our local, small-scale farmers. The film was very well-done; not too sensationalized but also very frank. I highly recommend it if you are looking for an honest look at the current state of affairs of our local farmers in the US. It's an eye-opener, but not too painful or difficult to watch like some documentaries.",1333324800,10,458,4.597560975609756

Great documentary on access to local food.  Who knew farmers had to deal with such challenges?
This film really motivated me to increase my support to local farmers.  I love using my farmers market as my food source.  Films like this will help keep access to local food going.

Anyone who has an interest in their food sources should see this film.
I wish there were more films like this.  Moo-ore please!",1333324800,12,545,6.105263157894737
5053680,5,B00744WZ8U,"Americans are beginning to realize the myriad problems with the industrial food system, and many people are turning to local farmers for alternatives.  But the farmers who work to produce healthy local foods face serious challenges from government bureaucracies that work for the interests of the industrial food system.

Farmageddon is an important movie that shows some of the challenges these farmers face, and why every person needs to become an active citizen, not just a consumer, if we want real change in our food system.",1333324800,65,529,5.1395348837209305
5053681,5,B00744WZ8U,"I saw this film in DC at the premiere and I'm looking forward to getting the DVD to share.

This film is an amazing eye-opener. I'm a big supporter of fresh and local food, and respect my farmers. I had no idea what small farms are up against these days, now I do.

Police with flack jackets and guns raiding small family farms, because of raw milk? Sounds more like a science fiction film rather than a documentary, but it's true. I did some fact checking on the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund website.

Most folks I know, value and trust the fresh food from our neighboring farmers, and don't need the government stamp of approval to know that it's good (or safe) to eat.

I mean come on, because raw milk from an inspected dairy crossed state lines, it's suddenly an imminent health hazard? That part made me angry. What a waste of food, money and time! That inspector looked like she was raised during the depression. How on earth did she let all that milk be wasted?

And, what about that Pennsylvania Amish farmer? They wiped out his store,(not once but three times!), put all the food in a hot truck, and dumped bleach on it in a landfill?

I read that in Pennsylvania 6 out of 100 people go HUNGRY, and their ag department would rather throw perfectly good food out, because the farmer doesn't have a license?

I hope you watch this film, become an advocate for food rights and small farms, and may even try a glass or gallon of raw milk. I found mine on the Real Milk website.

We've got to change the laws so that they encourage, protect and support these small family farms.",1333238400,96,1590,4.439862542955327

5053687,5,B00744WZ8U,"As an ordinary city-dweller, I have no expertise on farming, agricultural policy, or the cases presented here, so take my opinion for what it's worth. This movie is fascinating, chilling, and infuriating. The most powerful scene is the ""milk spill"" in Athens, GA, in which state and federal authorities find a farmer who is selling raw milk from S. Carolina and order him to spill it on the ground. Now, the sale of raw milk is illegal in GA, and there is a federal law or regulation that prohibits transporting it across state lines, so the actions taken were legal. But without any prodding by the filmmaker, the viewer feels that a great injustice is being done -- not to mention the senseless waste of an economic good. (And why did the farmer agree to pour it out himself? Couldn't he have refused and forced the authorities to pour it out?) Several other cases are presented, not all about raw milk. They show the horrible things that some Americans are willing to do to others in the name of power -- excuse me, ""food safety"".

One minor error: at about 42:30, two titles give information about ""The Smith's""; this should of course read ""The Smiths"". With that exception, the production values are surprisingly strong. Well worth 90 minutes of your time. If this doesn't make you think twice about what's going in your body, nothing will.",1428883200,,1345,4.6991525423728815

After spending 20+ years in the U.S. military, watching our own government's armed raids on family milk producers their children is eyeopening and makes me wonder what I fought to protect.  What a terrible waste, fraud and abuse these agency thugs push on their fellow Americans.

Unfortunately, it is more than family farmers being raiding and jailed for not paying protection money to the unthinking machine, it is anyone who threatens to generally improve the health of Americans.  Any helpful product is violently attacked and banned, so that more profitable human sicknesses can be cultivated and grown.

Big industrial food makers and municipal water treatment facilities pump purpose-built chemicals, toxins, hormones and antibiotics into the population design to sicken and dumb them.  Aspertame is named as a human domesticion drug that ""tames aspirations"" and feelings of aggression, as does fluoride which impairs human intelligence and has been scientifically proven over and over to causes diabetes and triple cancer rates.  Big hospitals feed on the result.  Big pharmaceutics and their M.D. trained pushers prescription medicate the masses, often on 5 or more powerful life-long meds.  Big insurance companies ensure prices are pumped to the moon, and people who can't afford to feed the machine are fleeced.  Lawyers litigate the avalanche of health and disability cases in kangaroo courts.

In the final analysis, it is ""We the People"" who are the farm animals.  Plumped, pumped, sickened, medicated, fleeced, and slaughtered.

The first segment is grueling - the senseless slaughter of all animals at a Vermont family farm - engineered by corruption within the FDA division of the United States Government - and as you'll learn - for NO reason.  You will be angry, or in tears, and hopefully moved to action.

True stories like these make me UN-proud to be an American citizen.  If you multiply the government corruption examined in this film times the numbers of untold stories, it seems beyond comprehension.  Story after story, our United States Government on federal, state and local levels abuses it powers in the name of what has to be money. In the meantime, citizens suffer, and with it free enterprise.

The private co-ops featured in this film are no different than the private enterprise that drives person to person private sales of books and movies on sites just like Amazon.  Yet, they are closed down, and lives are ruined.  And what makes it worse - these are people trying to sell safe and healthy products to their neighbors and communities.  Further, you'll watch as PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD is destroyed!

To me, the film sends a message that allowing the farming industry to flourish is a direct threat only to large corporations who wish to control the food chain, and the medical drug chain. This film is just one piece of a large picture - a future with less options, and less freedoms. It's ""we the people"" that must have the courage to change this path, at any cost.

5053763,5,B00744WZ8U,"I can't believe the tyranny that exists here in America as far as what we want to eat.  Farmageddon is a film that shows the public just how onerous the regulations are for small farmers.  Swat teams coming terrorizing families at the crack of dawn? Weapons drawn? And over what? Raw milk.  That's right, the same stuff the mothers feed their newborns, that cats feed their kittens, that all mammals feed their babies.  Yet the government sends in swat teams to shut down farmers who dare to sell it to us?  If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.

It's enough to make you think that there's a conspiracy to take away our God-given right to feed ourselves.  Okay, enough of my rant on personal freedom and responsibility.  Here's what the film is about.

A young mother finds her young boy allergic to just about everything.  After taking out the carpet, drapes and forgoing any pets, and putting her child on pharmaceuticals to no affect, Kristin Cantry hears that raw milk will help.  She quickly does her research and then drinks it herself to see if she suffers any ill-effects.  Finally, Kristin gives the milk to her son, along with only organic food, grass-fed meat, and no processed foods.  A miracle occurs.  Her son loses his allergic reaction to life and gets better.  It turns out that raw milk contains the enzymes our guts needs to process food.

Of course there's always a curse that goes along with a blessing, and what Kristin learns is that the small, organic farmers providing this miracle for her son, are being harassed by the government.  Why?  Because when a person gets sick from food, never from a small farm, only from large agrifarms, all farmers must pay to the point that sheep are killed over mad-cow disease.  I know it sounds crazy, since mad cow disease comes from feeding cows ground-up other cows, which is against nature because cows aren't omnivores.  Going against nature never ends well.

And if we all could collectively see how giant agrifarms raise our foods, we'd be appalled.  The film shows thousands of chickens living their lives out in crowded conditions, living in their own filth, with bald spots all over them, and eating god-knows-what kind of feed, instead of going out and eating grass, flowers and bugs like they're supposed to.

I saw hogs so crowded they couldn't move.  Can you imagine the misery of these poor animals who have to live their entire lives this way?

Another point of eating grass-fed meat is that grasses contain vitamins, B17 for example, that stop the growth of cancer.  This was not in the movie, but I'd read it in a book called The Cure For Cancer, many years ago.  And I've found that the more we stick to what's been working for thousands of years, the healthier we tend to be, and animals have been eating grass for a very long time.

In Farmageddon, I watched as Federal Agents poured out milk because it had crossed states lines.  I learned that the only crop more regulated is marijuana, which again, has health benefits.  The whole point of this film is that it shows us that we may be the home of the brave, but we're certainly not the land of the free if we can't choose whether we want milk that cooked(pasteurized) or not.

We can't live like our ancestors less than a hundred years ago.  And if raw milk is so bad for us, then how come breast-fed babies aren't all getting sick?  How come we can import baby formula from China that makes our babies sick, but we can't feed them milk from local cows?

Farmageddon introduces sanity into our food chain, and thank goodness there are people like Kristin Cantry to show us what's happening to our fellow human beings who only want to grow food for us.",1358467200,4,3715,4.587253414264036
5053764,3,B00744WZ8U,"If we want the government to be our mommy in other areas of our lives, why not food? Now, don't get me wrong - i happen to concur with the premise of this film entirely. The irony is, that many of the same people who are up in arms about the government's meddling in our food choices, are generally the same people advocating for more government (i.e. controls, subsidies, and special privileges for special interests) in most other areas of our lives.

In other words - you have no grounds for complaining if you are one who continues to vote for progressives and democrats, as they are the ones most responsible for the encroachment of the federal leviathan against our own self-interests. Of course, my assumption is that our self-interests have to do with preserving individual liberty and promoting personal responsibility over collectivist ideologies.",1358294400,16,857,4.951388888888889

5053769,4,B00744WZ8U,"This is a good documentary in showing the fraud in government.  It is a shame that small farmers are targeted and shut down. What this film shows very well is the problem inherent with government regulation.  Government regulation and interference in any industry invites fraud.  It does this because companies in industries to be regulated will rightfully want to look out for their own best interest. They will then lobby and spend money to put politicians in power to make sure that they get the best say in the regulations.  This then creates an unfair advantage for those companies or persons with the resources to best influence the laws and creates a disadvantage for the competitors. Government regulation inherently creates monopolies. While the film does a good job of showing the effects of this government interference into the free market, many of the people in the video seek new government interference to solve the problem.  More government interference is not the answer.  The answer would be to shut down the FDA and allow the free market to work correctly.  Government should only exist to punish crime and to provide a national defense.  The free market would allow for those that produce faulty products to fade out while those who provide the best product to succeed. I would suggest anyone who has watched this film read Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty.  It explains the problems that this film is complaining about.",1356739200,,1443,4.954356846473029

5053772,4,B00744WZ8U,"We have been looking forward to watching Farmageddon for some time. Thanks to a couple of hiccups with Netflix streaming it just became available on Friday. We wasted no time in sitting down after dinner to watch. What we observed was not news to us but when you hear mothers talk of the terror of having an armed agent pointing a gun at her with children in the house or the frustration of a farmer that is having their livelihood destroyed by bureaucrats, it brings home the reality of what is going on in our food system.

So much of our food comes from a bag or a box or a can or a cellophane wrapper. Little of what we eat is recognizable as actual food and is far removed from the farm. Sure it fills you up and sustains life but looking around at a growing population of people that are living longer but living less healthy lives is of major concern. The same government that seeks to take over ""health care"" in this country and regulate farmers who raise actual food at the same time coddles and subsidizes the production of unhealthy foods. The two major crops in this country, taking up enormous amounts of acreage, are field corn and soybeans. Guess what, you can't eat either of them! That is a little known fact. If you go into a nearby corn field or soybean field and try to eat what is growing there you probably will get ill. Our agricultural industry is focused on growing an inedible crop, crops that require a great deal of processing to turn them into something we can use or they are fed to livestock as unnatural feedstuffs that serve to pack fat onto animals at an incredible pace.

In this landscape there is another troubling development that has gone unnoticed for a long time but is finally getting the attention it deserves. This development is the intrusive action of the Federal regulatory bureaucracy, an unaccountable and increasingly militarized group, spending untold millions and ruining lives to prevent small scale agriculture from marketing their products to consenting and informed consumers. Into this war being fought across the country virtually unseen by the average America comes Farmageddon, a documentary look at just a few of the lives ruined and families terrorized by bureaucrats. When homes are broken into and businesses assaulted by agents pointing guns at law abiding, unarmed citizens for the ""crime"" of selling raw milk, something is very wrong. That a law enforcement agent should ever unholster his firearm, much less point it at an unarmed citizen who poses no threat, makes a mockery of our system of justice. We the people provide these men with firearms not for the purpose of terrorizing citizens or to make them feel like Rambo but to protect the people of the United States. Any agent of the government who pulls his gun and points it at an unarmed, cooperative citizen should lose his gun and his badge and face charges for menacing and assault.

As this film unfolds, we watch over and over again as the government of a country where hunger is a very real problem and obesity and other dietary related illnesses are growing into epidemic proportions sends armed officers to trash food supplies, force citizens to pour milk on the ground and seize the livelihood of farmers. While massive food conglomerates can sell unhealthy chemical compounds to consumers and call it ""food"" with the blessing of the government, small farmers are persecuted for selling actual food to consumers who make a conscious choice to pay more for a more natural product. I don't support the food police telling Wal-Mart that they can't sell Doritos and Mountain Dew but likewise I don't support the suppression of food producers filling a niche but growing market because it is seen as a threat by the mass produced food industry.

One of the things that stood out and was really cool was the diversity on  the farms they showed. None of the this homogenization where a ""farm"" only has one species and one breed of livestock. The farmers in Farmageddon milked Holstein, Brown Swiss, Jersey and Guernsey cows, raised a variety of cattle and sheep and had a wonderful mix of poultry. One of the things we love about where we live among the Amish is the diversity and activity on their farms. While our neighbor has a huge hog operation you would never know if it weren't for the smell because you never see the animals. They live their lives in confinement from birth to death, hybrids designed to produce a uniform product as efficiently as possible. The problem with that system is that an awful lot of our food is dependent on a pretty narrow spectrum of crops and livestock. If anything happened to those handful of products we would be in trouble. That doesn't stop the extreme homogenization where farms rotate a few crops or one species of livestock. On the other hand many Amish and other small scale farms are teeming with chickens, horses of course, cows, sheep, bees, goats and on and on. When we drive around there is always so much going on in tune with the rhythms of the seasons. Ironically and sadly the Amish in our area tend to consume a ton of junk food from Wal-Mart as well.

Films like this and the proliferation of blogs and other alternate news sources has brought to light the sort of unaccountable soft tyranny that has become the hallmark of the Federal government. As seen in books like Rand Paul's Government Bullies, these sorts of acts of authoritarian overreach happen all the time. An unelected, unaccountable government bully decides to make an example of a farmer or a land owner or a businessman and then proceed to bring the full weight of the government backed up by badges and gun. They have no disincentive to stop and an ego driven incentive to ""make an example"" of those who don't cower before a piece of paper waved by an employee of the FDA. I would encourage you to check this film out and show it to your friends. It may not seem like a big deal if you buy your food at the supermarket but if the government can run a small farmer out of business and seize their property",1355097600,2,6059,4.657943925233645

5053781,5,B00744WZ8U,"If you want to see tyranny in its purest form, this is the film for you.  If you want to see the ugly underside of unrestrained government, this is the film for you.  If you want to see the inevitable result of a police state let loose upon the people, this is the film for you.  If you want to see what's meant by the term ""Corporatocracy,"" this is the film for you.  If you want to see what the ""War on Terror"" is quickly evolving into, this is the film for you.  But if you want to bury your head in the sand and keep telling yourself ""It can't happen here,"" then this is most definitely not the film for you.

Certain assumptions - call them associations - have clearly been made by those who enforce ""The Law.""  One of them on display in this film is the equation of free-range farming with radical militancy.  When you see - on CCTV - police moving through a private country store, open only to members of a co-op, with guns drawn, you can't help but think of Ruby Ridge; these police are reacting as if they're dealing with some kind of Militia which might, at any moment, open fire.  When you hear a mother tell of her entire family being rounded up - at gunpoint - and held for six hours, confined to a single room of her house, you can't help conjuring up the term Storm Troopers.  When you learn how an official of the FDA deliberately lied in order to have perfectly healthy sheep rounded up and exterminated, the phrase State-Sponsored Terrorism comes to mind.

Here's the point that forces you - absolutely, positively, unequivocally forces you - to ask ""What's really going on?"": the small, independent, free-range, organic farmers are NEVER EVER EVER going to be any kind of economic threat to the Big Agribusiness Establishment!  There are simply too many people, and far too many people with extremely limited incomes and even more limited transportation resources, to ever abandon Agribusiness foods in favor of whole, fresh, organic foods.  They may wish to, but circumstances will conspire to prevent them from doing so.  It's just that simple.  So what's it all about?  Really, truly: what's it all about?  The only possible answer is tyranny, pure and simple, for the sake of tyranny.  There's simply nothing else out there - and, as the film makes abundantly clear, ""Public Health"" is nothing whatsoever but a cover for what's being done.  So, yeah, we got tyranny.",1346889600,7,2389,4.578823529411765

5053790,5,B00744WZ8U,"I was so excited to see Farmageddon among Amazon's recommendations for me.  I heard about this film about a year ago, but it has only been shown at select theaters (and none in my area), so I've just been waiting for it to be released.  When I noticed yesterday that it was available, my husband and I sat down and watched it then and there!

We both enjoyed this movie.  Since we care about real food, we see most of the food-related documentaries that are produced.  Even though the topic is interesting to us, it seems that there are usually a lot of overlaps among these sorts of films.  Farmageddon features several people that we are already very familiar with (including Sally Fallon, Mark McAfee, and Joel Salatin), so I was prepared for the movie to be pretty similar to other movies we've seen.  I was surprised (and impressed) that it was actually pretty different!

Although Farmageddon does talk about the virtues of good food, etc, that really isn't the focus of this movie.  Instead, this movie talks a lot about choice, and allowing other people to do what they're doing.  The movie presents several recent examples of instances where the government has basically gone after small farmers, where no threat existed, and they have lied and done illegal things.  Government agents bully small farmers, and threaten them, and they illegally seize equipment and animals to prevent the farmers from farming.

It's pretty amazing.  The story that really stood out to me was about this family that had dairy sheep.  The sheep were all imported, and they had been through a ton of tests, and they were healthy and had no risk factors at all...but government agents killed them all, claiming that they may have Mad Cow disease.  Even though no sheep has ever had Mad Cow disease, and even though the family's sheep had all been tested (by the government) and the test results showed they were negative.  I had never heard that story before, and I thought it was appalling.

So, what else can I say about this movie?
- It does not contain graphic, disgusting, or disturbing images like some of these types of movies do.  There are video shots of conventional chicken farming, etc, but it's nothing that will make anyone uncomfortable, I don't think.
- They interview a wide variety of different people (including many farmers, restaurant owners, lawyers, government representatives, etc), and I liked that.
- The main lady who made the movie seems likeable, but her narration sounded like listening to a 3rd grader's book report.  That was the only thing that I didn't really like, but hey, she's a real person, not an actress, so maybe it just makes the movie a little more authentic.  That's okay.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who eats food, or cares about being able to make choices about what they eat.  I think even people who don't really care about organic or raw food would probably find this movie interesting, from a political perspective.",1335744000,6,2966,4.7745098039215685

5053792,5,B00744WZ8U,"""If people let government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny."" Thomas Jefferson uttered this prediction 200 years ago and here we are, living it. Americans are the sickest, fattest nation in the world. The highest cancer rate. On. The. Planet.

How did we get to this point? Well, partly by letting the government decide what foods we eat and what medicines we take! Partly by the change from an agrarian (farm and land based) society to an industrialized one. We *escaped* the farm life and went to work in factories and offices. Now, because we have removed ourselves so many degrees of separation from the production of our own food, we've also given power to ""authorities"" to tell us what we can eat, where it can come from, who can produce and sell it, and on and on... ad nauseum.

The FDA and USDA have been leading the population like silly sheep to our own demise. They have allowed genetically engineered seeds to be grown and distributed without any studies to determine safety AND without any labeling to allow people to choose for themselves. Corn has now been labeled by the EPA *as an insecticide* and you are eating it! Wheat, corn, soy and milk have been altered from their natural state and allergies and disease are on the rise as a direct result. Kraft, Coca Cola and Walmart formulated their products differently for distribution in *other* countries because those countries do not allow the experimentation with their population that the U.S. does.

The question that naturally arises is ""How do I feed myself and my family good food, real food, the food that nourished mankind for all past generations up to this point?"" So, you do some research. If you are like me you do a LOT of research, and you find that those foods are still being eaten around the world, especially in other countries where they have relied on the wisdom of the ages and have *not* followed the way of industrialized nations, like us.

So, you start searching for those foods from farmers who are committed to a better way. You find a farm that raises their dairy cows on pasture where they can graze on grass (as cows were intended to do) and absorb sunshine and transform that grass and sunshine into the most amazing, nutrient dense milk available... only to find the FDA has gone before you (to save you from your poor ignorant self, you know) and made it illegal for that farmer to sell that perfect milk to you until... it has been denatured and stripped of its perfection, with all of the enzymes and beneficial bacteria (those are the ones responsible for keeping the pathogenic bacteria in check) destroyed. You find another for organic vegetables and yet others for pastured, grass fed meats, tree fruits, olive and coconut oils, nuts and seeds, grains and legumes and then you find that those farms undergo such a costly, circuitous route of permits, fees, hoops and red tape to get those foods to you that those foods are now beyond the means of the average citizen.

That's not quite bad enough though because some people will find a way to afford the foods that they know they need. So then, those authorities will use their unchecked power to seize and destroy (with no proof needed) animals and products with *absolutely nothing wrong with them*, NOTHING. Those farmers are shaking up the status quo and the FDA can not sit idly by and let people make their own choices. So they conduct sting type, covert operations, which cost millions of tax payer dollars EACH and they round up the bad guys and their contraband. Beautiful heritage dairy sheep. Kill 'em. Perfect grass-fed beef and artisan cheese. Douse it with bleach. Melons, coconuts and other produce. Load it into the back of a hot truck and let it rot. Arrest people. Threaten them with repercussions if they should *talk*. Seize their property. Multiple times if that's what it takes to BREAK them.

To quote one of my favorite crusading farmers who, naturally, makes appearances in this movie: folks, this ain't normal! We are being systematically broken. Our freedoms are being stripped away and we are... silent? Silence is the voice of complacency.

Watch this movie. If you are unmoved by what you witness then slink back to your corner, remote controller in hand. If, however, you ARE moved by the truth of what is happening in your back yard then buy copies and donate to public libraries, host a screening. Get involved. Do the research.

5053806,5,B00744WZ8U,"We saw Farmageddon - The Unseen War on American Family Farms last fall, when it was in a local movie theatre.  It's produced and directed by Kristin Canty, a mom of four, who couldn't understand why the healthy food she wanted to buy for her family, was so hard to find.

Kristin said, about why she made this film, ""I decided I needed to tell this story. My goal was to let these honest farmers using centuries old farming practices tell their side of the stories. So, I set out to make a film. Farmageddon is in no way meant to convince anyone to drink raw milk, or eat grass fed beef, but rather an argument to allow those that want to make those choices to do so. It is simply about freedom of food choice. The government needs to stop harassing small farmers, private food buying clubs and co- ops without food freedom.... we are not free.""

From the movie's website, ""Americans' right to access fresh, healthy foods of their choice is under attack. Farmageddon tells the story of small, family farms that were providing safe, healthy foods to their communities and were forced to stop, sometimes through violent action, by agents of misguided government bureaucracies, and seeks to figure out why.""

""Farmageddon highlights the urgency of food freedom, encouraging farmers and consumers alike to take action to preserve individuals' rights to access food of their choice and farmers' rights to produce these foods safely and free from unreasonably burdensome regulations. The film serves to put policymakers and regulators on notice that there is a growing movement of people aware that their freedom to choose the foods they want is in danger, a movement that is taking action with its dollars and its voting power to protect and preserve the dwindling number of family farms that are struggling to survive.""

I knew the basic premise of the movie before we went to see it as I had seen the trailer and have been impatiently waiting for it to come to a theater near me. It's such a travesty of justice that our small farmers are under fire, most times with no just cause. There are cases of food and animals being seized, hundreds of thousands of dollars of livestock, and equipment seized, for no reason.  No complaints had been filed, no one had gotten sick. There have been raids of private food clubs, guns drawn on young children. It's not just isolated instanced. Google ""farmers raided"" and you will see too many examples. There are more examples on my post of last year, [..]

This is not the American Way!

I thought Farmageddon was brilliantly directed. Where it could have just been a very depressing story, there's hope here too.  It's about the growing real food movement and how more and more people are looking to buy their food directly from their local farmers.

It's time for all of us to stand up for food freedom. For the freedom to choose real food for our families and for the choice to not have our food contaminated by GMOs. I am starting to wonder if it's going to take acts of civil disobedience - nonviolent resistance - and becoming vocal to the point where the FDA, USDA and our government understand that we are not going to put up with our small farmers being harassed and raided for good no reason.  It's time to stand up for ourselved and our farmers!

This is a film that everyone should see. It's only in a few theaters now, but if you are near anywhere there is a showing, it's an incredible film.  Below is the link to the website.

But the fact is that food and drink are highly regulated and there are many consumable items that are forbidden by law, and Im not talking about drugs or similar substances- Im referring to healthy foods made by small family farms. The injustice surrounding these actions against food freedom is the subject of Farmageddon.

Family farms have a difficult time surviving in todays industrial farm environment. Government laws tend to favor the larger, industrial farmers and work against the small farming family, many of which struggle to survive. The reasons for the discrimination are covered in Farmageddon and the viewer is presented with countless examples from real- life people who want to serve food that is healthy and wholesome, only to have their actions halted by the US government and its agencies.

Most of Farmageddon is aimed at the regulations against selling raw milk. Pasteurized milk is considered safer and because of this, it is often extremely difficult for a farmer to sell raw, unpasteurized milk to the public. In some states, direct selling of this raw milk is illegal. In other states, it is legal but heavily regulated. Its important that everyone eats safe food and drink but like the speakers on this film indicate, the governments actions often make no sense because other food industries sell foods that are potentially far more harmful than raw milk. It seems to be another case of government bias in favor of big business and many viewers will come away from viewing Farmageddon with a feeling of anger and desire for activism.

Chemical additives to food, GMO, and other questionable practices exist throughout the food industry. Big, industrial companies are responsible for these alterations of food, but little, if anything, is done to stop them. Meanwhile, the small family farm trying to produce and serve quality foods is prevented from selling its product, threatened with legal action, or forcibly shut down in some cases. These unethical actions are all part of Farmageddon, a documentary worthy of a look. It does move a little slower at times than I prefer, but it is still a good film about American food injustice, accurately showing that, even in America, we are not as free as we think.",1513728000,,2393,4.933002481389578
