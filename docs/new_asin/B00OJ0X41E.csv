6751927,5,B00OJ0X41E,"Verdict: If you like this kind of show, you will love HOL.

This season is very different as far as the old focus on people being pretty good at their jobs. The focus is really on relationships and the usual back stabbing approach that Marty and Jeannie have towards their relationships. Unfortunately, the characters not dimensional, lack depth, and do not get developed over the season. Fortunately, HOL gets away with this as the characters are interesting enough and the story lines are just compelling enough to make it happily through 12 episodes. I try my best to judge a show on whether the show establishes what it is trying to do or wants to be and how well that show achieves that goal. HOL establishes what it wants to be early on and never wavers far from that goal. In the end BRAVO for another successful season and I hope that viewers get at least two more.",1420070400,,873,4.525316455696203
6751928,5,B00OJ0X41E,So glad this incredibly acted series and written series is finally available on Amazon.  Showtime needs to make this series on demand as it airs.,1418256000,4,145,4.8
6751929,5,B00OJ0X41E,"This season was definitely House of Lies at its best. I was afraid going in since our favorite group of consultants were all separated and broken up at the start, but man did they make me feel ridiculous. They were gaining traction and taking business to a whole other level, until the inevitable other shoe dropped. But what a ride, I can't wait to see what season 4 brings us, but man am I going to appluad this release first. Not only were Don Cheadle & Co. at there best, but this season had amazing guest stars too (TI, Eliza Coupe & Mekhai Phifer to name a few).",1417564800,10,568,4.268518518518518
6751930,1,B00OJ0X41E,"UPDATE: Still, no Blu-Ray. However, Season 3 is now available for Ultraviolet pre-order, in SD & HD, for viewing starting New Years Day, 2015. (at least is on my VuDu acct, already ordered) If you already have SHO on demand, it has been put back up for SD & HD, to watch RIGHT NOW. YOU MUST see Season 3!

Season 1 debuts. I thought it was spectacular. It was aired in high definition. The first season was released to the public for ownership... DVD only. Okay, season 2 continues on. The show is definitely gaining some ground. I'll hold out. Season 2 ends. I absolutely love it! It is time, once again, to be released for home entertainment ownership. DVD only! I continue to wait. Season 3 begins. This show, is now at a whole new level. Spectacular! SEASON THREE BLEW ME AWAY! Surley, it must be brought to blu-ray, now. Nope, DVD ONLY! This, I completely misunderstand. The show is renewed, year after year! Now preparing for season 4, on January 11th. Still, no Blu ray. House of Lies has aired every Sunday, On Showtime, with spectacular audio, In high def, with spectacular visuals as well. 5.1 Dolby surround, at 720p. Now hitting FOUR YEARS? I could not wait any longer, literally. Last night, I went Ultraviolet. Unfortunately, Amazon has still not reached this capability, with their instant video streaming. I'm not saying that they don't have it for sale in HD streaming. But the ultraviolet capability, is about the most convenient catalyst for transportation of your collection imaginable. I bought both Seasons 1&2, last night in HD. (NOT SD). At less than $20, each. I never thought we would live in a day, where internet streaming, would have better quality, than a hard copy disc. I have been using Blu-Ray for a couple of years now. Also watching my shows in HD. Once you have done this, for a significant period of time, throwing in a DVD looks absolutely horrible! The music in season 3, was probably more significant than anything. Well, as far as the HD quality goes anyway. Outstanding. so, I see the release is set for January 13th, 2015. It looks like I will be returning to my VUDU account. which, more times than not, has certain releases before they come out on Blu ray or DVD. Just a heads up to HD users only. Myself, being somewhat of a bonus feature junkie, will have to take a loss, here. Though, Showtime, is quite lacking in that department, as well.",1417478400,2,2389,4.621176470588235

6752342,5,B00OJ0X41E,"Seasons 1 & 2 were good in their own ways, but season 3 is when the show really found its voice. This season was the first that I actually bought Marty and Jeannie as a couple, and wanted it to happen. In season 1 it was super disturbing and in season 2 I got pissed off that the writers seemed to keep trying to force it on us instead of just having a female character that WASN'T a love interest to the main character. But, season 3 made me see what they were going for all along and I became a shipper.

I am also a Parks and Rec fan so it was pretty cool to see Ben Schwartz and Jenny Slate in different roles interact with each other.",1465776000,,639,3.953488372093023

However, I personally do not want to watch them get stains on their underwear or throw up in a toilet.  It's bad enough that they destroyed the economy and the middle-class in one huge greed-fest, but watching this pointless show trying to be relevant in a 2-job-family-still- can't-make-it world makes me gag.  A bunch of Wolf of Wall Street wannabes trying to make money-grubbing look fun and cool, and failing to be either. Stop-action asides (really?)  Using a kid to make it LBGT-relevant.

I had not heard of House of Lies until I saw it listed on Amazon Prime. I watched it just for fun, not taking it too seriously, but I was drawn in by the characters and the wit.
This season, it's as funny as ever, and they are spreading their focus to more and more characters. Meanwhile, the show remains funny; the plots are intense, but not melodramatic. And every so often, something happens that really surprises and touches me. Roscoe's significant other, Lex, is a particularly great character; Lex manages to be mostly unlikeable all the time, but with a very sympathetic story.
So, if you want to breeze through House of Lies, catching an episode now and then, avoid Season 3. It's too good for that kind of viewing.",1464566400,4,754,4.510948905109489

 My wife doesn't appreciate the show as much as I do but I really enjoy watching it and think the dialogue is witty, snappy and keeps the pace moving very well.

6752805,3,B00OJ0X41E,"HOUSE OF LIES, Season 1, Ep. 1. 1/23/16  I have only seen this episode as of this date, and yes, I do realize I've missed a bit...oh, two other seasons, it seems. I do apologize for that error.  Not only have I missed out on some fun moments, (for television, OMG) now I've just learned some people have already begun to watch Season 4.  I am out of date, hopelessly, or so it would appear.

The truth is, I am out of date, but not hopelessly.  Honestly, I haven't watched TV in more years than some viewers here are old.  I simply couldn't take it anymore. No time wasted, no bulge gained, no rearranging my life for television? Uh, hell no!
I simply stopped paying for it. Disconnected cable, unplugged boxes, cut cords.  Here's something I learned from cable. Recall, at one time, it was almost a months pay as a fine or fee, if you did not return your cable set ups.  Now, need new ones? Just throw the old one out and we'll mail you a new one.  Quality? Not the issue. Quantity? Issue. These things are so over-produced now, they'll be giving you cash to take one. No, wait...make that two.

Knowing the story about the cable fiasco, You may ask yourself, ""What's the catch?""  Free Cash? Well, not exactly. Just review our film and tell us what you thin. But with this film, I find myself running both hot and cold.  Cheadle always delivers the solid punches. His writers know him  fairly well, and I suppose he chooses parts he knows will shine on his talent. The one and ONLY thing I can think of for Don to improve? Right away, I know. It's his worst attribute, IMO.  He speaks in a limited tonal voice. His pitch is off somewhere, and I hear him strain for certain ranges.  I'd suggest a vocal coach.  Helps bring the treble down to a decent tenor.  Not a falsetto.
That would be about the only reason to drop this show.  If you can live with it, go ahead, I believe the show will continue to improve, not because this page is a retro, post seasonal success review, but because I really enjoyed the vocal and the physical humor in the show, from what  I saw.
I am watching Showtime on a free week's basis, and decided to catch one or two episodes of each new show. No sports. No kid stuff. So I do feel this would be a good bet, the added cost for just Showtime doesn't make this show worth the cash.  I'm headed back to netflix.",1453507200,,2338,4.28246013667426

6752833,3,B00OJ0X41E,"I don't know why everyone has rated Season 3 so highly. There is very little insight into the consulting profession, just cynical backstabbing among the characters and too much storyline about their personal relationships (except for the experiences of Marty's teenage son). The stories, while fast moving, are not really believable, and there are too many negative stereotypes such as the rich female entrepreneur who's a coke-head, and former drug-dealing rappers who built a music empire but who can't control their violent behavior.
