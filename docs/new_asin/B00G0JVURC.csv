8619908,2,B00G0JVURC,"A lawyer is blackmailed into defending a hard-nosed judge accused of rape. I was looking forward to this film because it stars Pacino and sounded like a good courtroom drama. Its a mess. There are comedic scenes which aren't that funny, and there are so many subplots the viewer never knows where the plot is going next. The climax is unrealistic and falls flat. A big disappointment.",1497052800,,384,4.746268656716418
