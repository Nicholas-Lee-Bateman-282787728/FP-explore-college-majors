8404515,5,B003SNKC7M,"For those of us who have lived on the coast of Maine or have dreamed of living there, for those who sail the coast of Maine, and for all of us who love Maine, this film is a delight.  It is a well-planned and well-executed aerial tour, with excellent photography, along the coast, beginning near the New Hampshire border and continuing all the way to Lubec, including the islands.  There is no narration and none is needed.  Each major place is labeled in clear but unobtrusive text so that one could follow the route on a large-scale map if he or she wished to do so.  We viewed it twice, the second time with a map; some of the interesting places and sites were new even to me.",1374364800,,679,4.28125

8404517,4,B003SNKC7M,"Maine is a treasure of unimagined dimensions. Sites that will leave you breathless, food that is unbelievable, experiences of a lifetime....stunned from all that is there. Considering retirement in this great state....",1328832000,,218,5.84375
8404518,1,B003SNKC7M,Dvd played for about a minute and a half and then stopped.  Another one was sent to me and this one also stopped at the same place.  A requested refund finally took care of the problem!,1306886400,2,185,4.111111111111111
8404519,1,B003SNKC7M,it and the replacement stick 6 minutes into video.  flawed product.  tried it both copies and several players and the second copy wouldn't even play on a blue ray either.,1296000000,2,170,4.633333333333334
