937281,4,6304905386,I saw this movie as a little kid on TV on day and I have been looking for it in video stores ever since.  I recently found it at a shopping mall and bought it.  I was excited to bring it home and watch it.  I was just as  excited to watch it as I was when I was a child.  Never ending excitement  and suspense.  The action scenes are the best!  Bruce Lee look out because  this movie (although not quite as good as Bruce Lee's) will give even THE  MASTER himself a run for the money.  I recommend this movie to anyone who  is looking for a good kung-fu flick.,928627200,,559,3.892857142857143
937282,5,6304905386,"This is THE saturday afternoon Kung Fu theatre flick of all time!! Definitely one of the best, if not the best Shaw Bros. film ever. Definitely a must have for any fan of the genre. Although it is another  great flick starring the ""venom mob"", don't be fooled by  ""Return of the Five Deadly Venoms""- it's actually a Shaw Bros.  movie called ""Crippled Avengers"" aka ""Mortal Combat"".  It stars all of the ""venoms"" except the ""snake""- actor  Wai Pei.",926899200,,447,4.6075949367088604
937283,5,6304905386,"I too used to watch this movie on saturday kung-fu theater (i had to have been 5 or 6 at the time). I could still remember the scene where two of the  five are attcking SNAKE and one goes high the  other goes low.  That was  some great s#!+
If you've seen this flick, but haven't seen RETURN OF...  then you are missing out.
RETURN OF... right from the start grabs your  attention and keeps it throughout.  It begins with three men breaking into  the home of one of their enemies to get revenge.  He's not there, but his  wife and son are.  The three men kill his wife and cut his son's hands off.  That's when daddy gets home and the story picks up...  I don't want to  spoil anything for you guys, but I'll say this: there's a pretty big twist  right after the intro  that you'll never expect (5 stars for this flick)",926812800,6,819,4.153846153846154

937410,4,6304905386,"Dubbed in English and it has very good choreography in its fight scenes.  A master has five secret pupils, each with his own kung-fu style of a poisonous creature--snake, centipede, scorpion, frog and lizard.  Each pupil is very powerful, but some has become bad guys and some good guys.  The bad guys are greedy for treasure/money and the good guys are interested in justice.  The master trains a sixth pupil who has learned a bit in each of the five styles, but can only be powerful if he joins forces with one of the five.  Upon doing so, he's kung-fu capability is strong enough to defeat the other four pupils.  So, this sixth pupil is set to go out to find all five secret pupils and as a lure, locate a classmate of the master who knows where the treasure is and see who chases after it.  Finally, a kung-fu movie with a decent story and well choreographed kung-fu.",1501200000,,872,4.446540880503145

937468,1,6304905386,"This is a children's  movie.  Every once in a while, you can notice that a ""action sequence is performed""  and  a verbal explanation of what that action meant  is given in words.  Another clue is the obvious  ""air  attacks""  in fighting, where you can clearly see that there is no contact between people, but one person staggers back. Its a wonder that it is rated so high. I quit watching after a bit.",1498780800,,402,4.397260273972603

937470,5,6304905386,"Part detective drama and part Kung Fu adaptation of Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"", The Five Venoms is a brilliant fusion of elements into a Kung Fu variant of Chinese noir.  The film starts out with all the hallmarks of excellent Kung Fu cinema.  A moribund Master sends a poorly trained student to quite literally unmask some former ne'er-do-well trainees--the eponymous 'Five Venoms'.  The action centers around a heinous crime--the murder of an affluent family--and the investigation that follows.  What emerges is the unfolding of a suspenseful mystery while tensions slowly build as each of the Master's former students is methodically revealed.  The final scene explodes into an all-out brawl between the players as we finally learn the secret identities of all of the Master's former students.  The result is a most satisfying and cathartic denouement where good triumphs over evil.

Spoiler alert, read no further if you've yet to watch the film.

I loved every part of The Five Venoms.  I especially loved the pathos elicited by the torture and eventual murder of the Toad.  Leave it to the Shaw brothers to explore complex themes like class inequity and gender identity by using Kung Fu fighting as the vehicle.  Truly a thinking mans (or womans) Kung Fu movie.  I can't recommend this film enough.",1497744000,,1310,5.0418604651162795

937698,5,6304905386,"The Five Venoms is an excellent film! If you enjoy the Shaw Brothers productions, or even just 70's and 80's Kung Fu drama, action, beat em' up films; this one is on the level. The plot consists of a ""comic book"" like set of Chinese-super-Kung-Fu-heroes/villians. All the actors display a set of real world acrobatics and Kung Fu skill, and enlist era appropriate effects to properly showcase the characters ""superhuman"" dynamic. Plot twists of a sort, are a bit trying to the viewer but are redeemed by mild character development that brings on highly enjoyable action scenes. Audio dubbing is good and of course gives the ""old Kung Fu flick"" vibe almost immediately. It does contain some violently bloody scenes, but can easily be brushed off by the younger viewers as corny and over the top. 5 out of 5 is truly earned with this one.

A few errors, noticeably Yang calling himself 'Number 4' and in the final battle the Lizard refers to Centipede as 'Number 5' when he's actually 'Number 1'.  Yang calling himself ""Number 4' may imply that the master may have trained a new set of 5 venoms but the master says that Yang was his last pupil. It's nitpicky i know, but thought I'd point it out.

937996,5,6304905386,"The Five Deadly Venoms (1978): Today the word ""classic"" is as overused and as misused as the word ""genius""--Kanye West calls himself ""genius"" and believes he is one because he says so, and millennials believe his delusion because they have no point of reference, nothing to compare him to that would immediately prove he is as unlikely a genius as I am to both purchase and wear a pair of skinny jeans. But back to ""classic."" ""Classic"" in terms of art means ""timeless""--it means that a work transcends the period in which it was created, which brings us to The Five Deadly Venoms. Released in 1978, I first saw the film probably in the very-early '80s; every weekend on channel 5 a martial arts flick was shown; most of it dreck; but even then, a boy of maybe eleven or twelve, I knew Venoms was something special; and it is only watching it now, a man of forty-seven, that I truly know why.

Centipede (heightened speed and reflexes), Snake (puncturing fingers and fists), Scorpion (lethal penetrating kick), Lizard (climbing and adhering to walls),Toad (great strength and impenetrable skin)--these are the main styles of the Poison Clan; and when the last expert of each style abandons his clan to seize a treasure they believe is rightfully theirs, a sixth member, the last to be taught, is dispensed by his dying master with these instructions: ""If they are bad, you must kill them."" The sixth has briefly trained in each of the five's techniques, so to defeat them he must join with at least one to combat the other four.

The story is a simple one, but is executed so well and with such skill that Venoms is more enjoyable than most of the overwrought, poorly written, CGI trash being released today (Batman Vs. Superman, for example). Despite its simplicity, though, one might say ""there are layers to this s***."" When the Toad is framed for murder and refuses to be taken in out of a healthy distrust of the law and lawmen, we understand his distrust, and also why even his invulnerability will inevitably be vulnerable against the sword of injustice, which always cuts deep. And when the treasure is finally found, the remaining Poison Clan members vow to use it to pay a dept their clan owes, a dept created with blood and pain and misery--the treasure will be used to give...reparations...for centuries of the clan's unspeakable evil.... There are moments like this throughout the movie, and it is these moments, along with good acting, great story, and excellent choreography, which make the Five Deadly Venoms a true ""classic,"" a work that transcends the era it was made.",1476403200,,2585,4.767857142857143

The first really good fight didn't happen until about 40 minutes into the movie. The end fight was excellent and was definitely innovative.(I can't say how, don't want to be a spoiler). The hand-to-hand was awesome but weapons were rarely used if at all and that's my favorite part of these movies.

938766,5,6304905386,"One of my early memories - catching the commercial for this on ""Black Belt Theater"" one Saturday. Of course, it relied heavily on the ""I had five pupils"" intro. It was years later, but I remember my reaction being similar to my reaction after seeing a TV spot for STAR WARS: If I don't see this, I probably won't survive.

Then I watched it and my favorite character was framed, tortured and killed, while the bad guys ran around scot-free. Yes, the other two remaining protagonists revealed themselves to be as cool as poor Li Ho, and made with the Justice, but it was a little hard for my kid brain to process. Really, the reason the bad guys lost was...because of the bad guys. I don't think I was ready yet for the theme of this movie, which is EVIL WILL EAT ITSELF. Evil might be stronger than good, more pervasive, but in the end, evil will eat itself. That isn't what hooked me as a youngster - what got me was the mood, the color, the world-building magic of Movietown (when you watch this one, keep in mind there is not one single exterior shot - even the city is indoors at the Shaw's Movietown). The feeling created with the iconic intro, the classic De Wolf library soundtrack, Chiang Sheng's funky threads at the end, the incredible cool of Kwok Choi...it hooked me then, it it still does whenever I play this one.

5DV isn't non-stop action - it's more of a suspense film. But there is still plenty of payoff for kung-fu fans, and this movie influenced, well, read the back of the box for that stuff. Bey Logan says in the (very good) commentary track that it's almost impossible to overstate the influence this film has had, and he's right.

This is a fine transfer, showing off the intense colors (they maybe went a little far with the noise reduction? But it's MINOR), opulent sets and costumes, and the amazing skills and presence of The Venoms (why do you think they're called The Venoms?). Of course, it's a Weinstein product, so parts are half-assed - the subs are mostly okay, but with enough embarrassing errors to make fans grit their teeth at several points. Luckily, this has one of the more enjoyable English dubs, and that's what I'd recommend for most viewers. Dub-hater that I am, I'd still say it's one of the few classic ones, if you want experience that authentic 70's kung-fu craze feel. ""Poison Clan Rocks the World!""

In all fairness, I'm letting my dissatisfaction with other DD releases color my opinion of THIS one - other than the half-assed subtitles (still watchable) this is one of their better efforts. And no RZA, which is a huge plus.

I don't know if this movie is day one, Kung Fu 101 - it's definitely first semester, though. But it's such a presence in the world of hip-hop and action cinema that it falls into the category of required viewing for everyone, fu-fan or no.",1400889600,,2821,4.523529411764706

The senior teacher tells the new student to search a town where his co-teacher is hiding with the massive treasure they had acquired in the clan. The student goes into the town and learns its not easy to find the venoms but things picks up when there is a murder of an old man.

939416,4,6304905386,"I saw this on TV many years ago and thought it was a great martial arts movie.  When I spotted it available on DVD a number of years ago on Amazon, I bought it.  The version I got was just OK. It was like watching the movie on a TV broadcast but at least I had a copy.  Then Dragon Dynasty came around and made 36th Chamber of Shaolin available which was another one of my favorite martial arts movies.  So now they came out with Five Deadly Venoms in both DVD and Blu-ray so I bought the Blu-ray version.  Boy is it a significant difference from my old dvd copy. My old dvd version was from Master Arts Video distributed by Steeplechase.  There may have been better versions around but I wasn't aware of them and it was the only one available from Amazon at that time.  If you have an older version that looks like (or just slightly better than) a TV broadcast of the movie, get this one.  Also this one includes commentary by Bey Logan which I found interesting. He knows all about the various actors and their background (i.e. the other movies they starred in, which studios they worked for, etc.)  If you like martial arts movies but don't know much about the stars, directors, producers, the chinese studios, etc. you may find it interesting as I did.  And if you have a blu-ray player... and the blu-ray version is even cheaper than the equivalent dragon dynasty dvd version (least currently it is cheaper), how can you pass this up.  (If you want to find out about the movie itself you can read the various dvd reviews about it.) Just wanted to provide info about this great version of the movie.",1307664000,,1603,4.381756756756757
939417,5,6304905386,"This Blu-Ray has excellent picture quality.  It was like watching it for the first time.  And it is even better than at the movie theatre.

I remember watching it at the movie theatre when it first came out.  It was so big on the movie screen that you can't really get the whole picture.  And when there was an area that was out of focus, it really magnified the focus defect. (This is my point of view.  As when ever I get to the theatre in Chinatown back then, it was always pack, thus I always had to sit close to the screen watching it up close.)

If you have a big screen or one of decent size, this Blu-Ray will make a big difference in picture quality.  And it won't be too big, as in the theatre, where the defect is over magnified.

It seems the subtitle was done by a foreigner, none native english speaking.

Subtitle 1 seems like a direct translation from Madarin where the meanings were translated literally.

Subtitle 2 is a direct translation from the english dub version.  But the translator must not be an english speaker as you can tell from the scene with the 6th venom & the 5th venom toad meeting at the restaurant. When the toad toss a silver piece to the 6th venom, pretending to be a bum, the 6th venom walk in over to the toad table.  The toad said ""Sorry, I have a guest.  Sit elsewhere"".  But the subtitle 2 shows"" Sorry, I would get. Sit elsewhere""  as if the translator listen directly to the english dub but their english was so poor that they can not hear it correctly.

I will not review the movie as this is a classic. And there are many review about the movie on the DVD version.

I highly recommend this Blu-Ray.

939418,4,6304905386,"When it comes to martial arts films, most claim that Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"" is the best ever made.  I gather because it was a Warner Brothers production with it's producer Fred Weintraub.  I also gather it is because it has a ""multi-cultural"" cast instead of an all Chinese traditional cast.  Well, if you believe that to be the case or not, others suggest that ""The Five Deadly Venoms"" is either the next best thing or the best in and of itself!

No need to go into the story as many are familiar with it.  This is one of the few martials arts films that has a decent story, suspense, action and intrigue.  A few years ago, I bought the DVD version and I was very disappointed.  It looked like a 3rd generation dub of a bootleg VHS tape!  I wrote the company and they sent me another film (on a VHS tape!) to make it up to me.  From then on, I get very concerned whenever a martial arts film get's released, let alone on Blu-ray.

I read one (non-professional) review and they said it was as good as they have ever seen it and the convinced me to buy it.  I made the right call!  The picture far exceeded my expectations!  It is true HD, crisp, clean, very detailed and looks as if you are watching them film the movie in person!  This is no BS!  I cannot believe that I could not find s decent copy on DVD, but BD hits a homerun right out of the gate!

From the moment the picture starts and they show the masks and smoke, you know that you are in for something special because you have NEVER seen this film look this good!  The whole film just looks so much better, that I would hope that all martial arts films could look this way!  It is in mono 2.0, but who cares?  Surround would have been nice, but I'll take the high level picture quality over an after-the-fact surround sound.

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is becuase there are no extras.  I would have at least preferred a trailor.  A behind the scenes featurette or an interview with the actors would have been nice.  My only other non-Hollywood martial arts film is ""The 36th Chamber of Shoalin"" which was in 1080i, not 1080P, but that still looked great too.  Even ""Enter the Dragon"" was not encoded right.  It has ""jaggies"" and it must be 1080i converted of something.

It seems that they are reviewing the bad  and bootleg prints of this film from Director Chang Cheh.

If it is not the Dragon Dynasty release then don't buy it!

My review is simple... this is one of the greatest martial arts films ever produced. This was the film that made the ""venoms"", including Kuo Chue, Lo Meng, Lu Feng and Chiang Sheng... The fight scenes are very well done, and edge of your seat. This is a true masterpiece of the genre, and has been copied many times but never equalled! A true must see and a must own!

939425,4,6304905386,"This review pertains to Celestial Pictures' release of this film.

It is important to note that many of the one-star reviews of this film refer to earlier editions of this film.  The current item entry you could be looking at is by Dragon Dynasty.  I haven't seen this latter, exact edition, but Dragon Dynasty has done quite an excellent job on a number of other Hong Kong films I've seen (John Woo's Hard Boiled, King Hu's Come Drink with Me, Chang Cheh's The Heroic Ones), so I suspect some of those one-star reviews' critique of the transfer and audio quality may not apply to the Dragon Dynasty edition.

I had also been utterly disgusted when I'd first tried to watch this film around 2002.  The DVD I'd rented was horrible, with only a badly dubbed English audio track; I couldn't even get through the first 10 minutes of the film.  But I decided to give this film another chance this past week, in a different edition, and I'm glad I did.

The Five Venoms is Chang Cheh's most famous film in the West only because his earlier films are harder to find.  But The Five Venoms is surprisingly robust by late Chang Cheh standards.  It has a script by I Kuang and Chang that harkens back to their best collaborations in the '70s, and Chang even does a pretty good job with the acting, which was a serious thorn in his side when it comes to his later output.

I was surprised to see actor Chiang Sheng, usually a bad clown looking for cheap laughs, perform somewhat acceptably in this film.  It probably helps that he disappears for a long time in the middle of the film, so his horrible comedic shenanigans (which Chang usually indulges in films like Crippled Avengers) are curbed.  He returns in the final act of the film after the tone has turned deadly serious, and Chiang does just fine.  Philip Kwok Chui (One-Eyed Dog in John Woo's Hard Boiled) fares pretty well as fourth Venom Lizard, the conscience of the film, but the greatest star turns in this film are Lo Meng and Wei Pai.  Lo (playing fifth Venom, Toad) provides that favourite Chang Cheh character, the righteous hero who gets mortally wounded but keeps fighting in a bloody mess.  That character usually provides Chang's films with the stakes and emotional thrust of the final act, and Lo is quite good in that role.  As an actor Wei Pai, only around 21 when he did this role, is on a higher level than everybody else, demonstrating the same star quality that also propelled him to the lead role in John Woo's Last Hurrah for Chivalry.  Wei's character Snake (second Venom) is that kung-fu-film rarity, a vicious, detestable villain who actually has a human side.  You love to hate him.  The Five Venoms actually manages to explore why this character became as evil as he did, and it's refreshing and surprising to see a villain who isn't a cardboard cutout.

The script even manages to explore the angle of government corruption and injustice in a satisfying way -- ""We constables no longer cull the strong and protect the weak; we cull the weak and protect the strong.""  The ending even goes back to its theme in a much more intelligent way than I've ever seen in any Chang Cheh film since The Heroic Ones.  A kung-fu film that manages not to forget greater moral and story themes gets extra kudos in my books, helping to dissolve the perception that these movies are only about a bunch of half-naked, blood-covered guys beating one another to a pulp.

The fight choreography is very nice, with typical Chang Cheh attention to details like unique moves for each character.  The camera work is some of the best in Chang Cheh's canon, for once not looking rushed.  The film is not for the squeamish because it is filled with sadistic torture scenes -- the iron maiden scene (""Ten-Thousand-Needle Suit""), the ""Red Saddle"", the ""Throat Hook"" and ""Brain Pin"" are all very disgusting and disturbing -- but at least those scenes serve a story purpose, although you do get the feeling that the good guys fall asleep and do nothing for about 25 minutes in the middle.

This film also has that edge of weird, occult-inflected flavour that informs many of the greatest Chinese martial-arts films.  No wonder that the concept of the Five Venoms clan would spawn a slew of sequels.  Many ideas in this script aren't new -- ""Five Venoms"" is a stock Chinese phrase frequently used in Jin Yong's classic Wu Xia novels, which had also originated the concept of ""Toad Force"" as a formidable kung-fu move.  But Chang Cheh managed to produce an enjoyable, weird, and engaging film using these familiar elements.

I am glad I paid this film a belated second visit.  It deserves its cult status, and is essential viewing for any fan of martial-arts cinema.  Do try to find a good edition, though.  The Celestial Pictures edition I saw is good, with original language tracks intact and fairly good subtitles.  This film made an extra effort to be more meaningful and so it pays for us to understand what it's trying to say beyond flying fists and feet.",1265587200,,5000,4.625141562853907

I would have loved to have seen interviews and other extras featuring the surviving Venoms but this is still a wonderful disc. There are different opinions among reviewers but the overall consensus is that this is one of the greatest Martial Arts films ever and it never gets old. I love the final battle where my main man Kuo Chui and the late Chiang Sheng team up against Lu Feng, Sun Chien, and Wei Pai. This breathtaking fight scene was the measuring stick for countless Venom Mob and other Kung Fu flick finales. I sometimes wonder if director Chang Cheh's wicked weapons, traps, and other pain devices also had an influence on torture series like Saw and Hostel. Anyway, this is a must have for real Kung Fu film collectors and I hope Dragon Dynasty keeps up the great work.

939581,2,6304905386,"As a fan of the martial arts films, i recognize that 5 Deadly Venoms is considered by many to be a classic Shaw Brothers staple of the genre. I've watched this DVD several times both recently, and a few years ago. And, try as i might, i just don't like the film.

The shortcomings of the DVD have been enumerated already... ie: poor audio, only one English audio track, and poor video transfer to DVD. But there's much more that bothers me about this film. The costumes and makeup are super crappy looking - which may be par for the genre at this period - but it seems like all the characters have the same hairstyle. Frankly it gets hard to tell who's who.

Much mention is made of the fight scenes in this flick. But actually, there is relatively little action. Instead there is a LOT of talking by cheesily costumed players who basically look the same. There are also a number of very gruesomely violent torture/death scenes - which, in my view make this the darkest film of its kind. Some parts are literally hard to watch. Did i mention that there is a LOT of freaking dialogue?

All these drawbacks could be redeemed if the fight scenes were spectacular and plenty - but, unfortunately, they are neither. We all know that these fights are choreographed - but the moves in this film all just LOOK so darned choreographed. It's hard to even suspend your disbelief and imagine that these are real fights. Admittedly, there is a certain late 70's kitchy charm about some of the action, editing and sound effects. But, having said that, there just isn't enough of of it to justify sitting through the interminable dialogue and plot scenes.

I'd love to see a DVD reissue with commentary and special features, that would help me understand why people like this film so much. Until then, i have to be honest and say that it's not enjoyable for me - and i have tried.",1235865600,,1865,4.508875739644971

Most of the film is a plodding murder mystery that will have you reaching for the remote and the fast forward button - insipid dialog, bad acting, zero suspense, no location shooting, and cheesy special effects. Back in 1978 this may have been top-notch martial arts film-making, but in comparison to more recent efforts it holds up very poorly. For history buffs and nostalgia trippers only.

Long story short, I looked up one of the samples from a Wu-Tang song and was directed to The Five Deadly Venoms. It looked kitchy and fun, and for eight bucks, what the hell? right?

I watched this film the day it arrived and then watched it again the next day with my brothers-in-law.

Like most of the reviewers, I caught this movie as a kid on ""Drive In Movie"" Saturday afternoon in the early 80s. Actually, ""Chinatown Kid"" (another classic starring the Venoms & the late Fu Sheng) was my first official intro to the incredible Shaw Brothers/Chang Cheh realm. ""Five Venoms"", along with ""The Kid With the Golden Arm"" (same people behind that), ""Master Killer"" (directed by Liu Chia-liang, starring his half-brother, Gordon Liu) & ""The Prodigal Son"" (Samo Hung wing chun classic), is simply one of the best.

First, the film itself~everyone seems to know the story, dying sifu (Tu Lung a.k.a. Dick Wei) of the Poison Clan sends his last student Yang Tieh (the late Chiang Sheng) to seek out his other five students. Ally himself with one virtuous venom and kill the ones who are villainous. The five venoms are #1 Centipede; Tang San-kwei (Lu Feng), #2 Snake; Hung Wen-tung (Wei Pai, who I never considered to be a real venom. He was only in four of their films and wasn't a real martial artist like the rest of them), #3 Scorpion; Ma Tang (Sun Chien), #4 Lizard; Ho Yung-hsin (Philip Kuo Chui) & #5 Toad; Li Ho (Golden Arm himself Lo Mang).

Despite not having as many fights as some of the other Venom classics, the story is so engrossing it doesn't matter. However, the fights that do occur deliver the goods. Kudos to Robert Tai & Liang Ting for their choreography, especially Toad versus Centipede and that incredible end fight. Even Wei Pai looks good, although he's totally outclassed by Kuo & Chiang. Great performances and great music. I know it's stock music but Chen Yung-yu really picked out some of the best tracks.

A little trivia info, the Snake venom was originally supposed to be played by a woman and #1 & #2 were husband and wife. Director Chang Cheh (reportedly a chauvinist) scrapped the idea because he didn't want a woman having a lead role in his movie. Next, the DVD transfer~the Red Sun version is the best one right now, they must have borrowed their version from Celestial. It's widescreen, crisp picture, decent audio and it's uncut (you see the Scorpion sort of lose his mind right before he dies). Unfortunately, it's dubbed but at least it's those Australian people doing the English voices. Good news, Celestial Pictures did a slamming job on their version; bad news, it's region 3.  However, Image Entertainment has been re-releasing awesome prints of Shaw Brother classics on region 1.  Check out my review for ""Have Sword Will Travel.""",1174262400,6,2644,4.776805251641138

But of course, the masks are what sets this movie apart, and gives it its most distinctive flavor- even though, aside from the Scorpion, no other character wears his mask for more than the first few minutes of the film.
The HUGE downside to this DVD is, as others have pointed out, the quality of the print.  It is simply terrible.  Grainy and scratched, with multiple blips and splices, it is annoying to watch on a medium like DVD which is normally so pristine.

I had heard both were classics but ultimately I was won over by The 7 Grandmasters because, well, 7 is a lucky number and the quality of the DVD case was well designed. Yeah, I fire with all pistons when it comes to logic.

7 Grandmasters was a phenomenal martial arts movie and is now probably one of my favorites. Not only did it provide some awesome martial arts work it has a story and characters you actually cared about. It was a movie that broke the ""kung fu movie stereotype"" that gets these old school films so little of the respect they deserve.

Just like Five Deadly Venoms.

The plot of the movie begins with the master of the Poison Clan on the verge of death. His last request of his final student is to search out 5 of his deadliest students and for him to make sure that what the master taught them isn't being used for ill. The former students are The Snake, The Centipede, The Lizard, The Scorpion, and The Toad and yes, they are all named after the respective styles they were taught...each with particular advantages the others don't have. These are totally unique styles with particularly bizarre (and not coincidentally, entertaining) attributes: The Scorpian primarily uses his legs and has a superhuman grip while The Toad is just plain indestructable to name just a few.

Since these students were all taught wearing masks the master himself has no clue as to their identities. The final student of course agrees to the mission and our movie begins...

What follows is a rather unpredictable, well-directed, and well acted martial arts film.

While later, not as well crafted martial arts films poured on cliche after cliche to the point where almost nothing was surprising Five Deadly Venoms swerves and pivots with unpredictability. Compared to the films I was used to Five Deadly Venoms defies convention in a few areas. Here are just a few...

1) The hero of the film isn't all powerful.

2) There is no MAIN villain...but the ones there are are hardly comical and you will even find yourself hating them character-wise.

3) You actually empathize with the emotions of the characters.

And I actually watched the DUBBED version.

The only caveat I have in regards to the film is that the actual martial arts works isn't over astounding (though there are a few moves I found to be rather surprising) if they are pretty unique (The Lizard's ability to cling to walls is surprisingly well done.). This, all in all, is a really small gripe. The choreograpy in the film is actually very well done and fast paced as opposed to the slow, more methodical style of less impressive movies. The story itself is so engaging that I actually wouldn't care if the fighting was limited to shadow boxing.

The point is: if you love martial arts films you owe to yourself to check out Five Deadly Venoms. You won't be disappointed.",1127260800,6,3020,4.624299065420561

Set in ""old"" China and featuring a suspenseful plot (a mystery, no less), garish (yet not overly lavish) costumes/set design, and some great old school combat/camera work, this may not even be the best film from either the legendary Shaw Brothers or famed director Chang Cheh himself but there's just something about the pacing of the story which is in no hurry to go anywhere too soon. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. It is creepy and the tension builds...perhaps not remarkable qualities for a vintage Kung Fu flick but this picture makes the most of it.

Another thing about the movie deserves praise: the absolutely fantastic score! It is austere AND comical, spare, seductive, and sinister without being cheesy. Extraordinary music! - even if it IS ""borrowed"" from other movies as some say....so be it. To me, the score is what really puts you in the world of 5DV.

PLEASE READ: I own both the DVD and the VHS video (the Steeplechase/Martial Arts Video versions) and they are flippin' LOUSY, with the DVD having a marginally better picture/bad sound and the video having much clearer sound/a horrible picture tracking problem. I could be wrong, but in their mastering of the DVD, it seems that Steeplechase/ M.A.V. simply took a bad widescreen edition VHS tape of the movie and did a poor transfer (although I HAVE seen worse) via the ol' mirror in a shoebox technology. Ha! Typical! The soundtrack is muffled like when you play a non-Dolby encoded cassette tape back with the Dolby switch on. I can't speak for the Front Row Video, Inc. version they're selling on Amazon.com but don't hold your breath. Here's hoping that Celestial Pictures (who now owns the rights to many 1970s Hong Kong classics like this one) get their act together and release a spiffy new version of 5DV. Two essential things for a new release: Original film negatives for a better picture and, for Pete's sake, the original recorded elements for clear, non-muffled sound. Some subtitles would be nice, too. Note to Celestial Pix: Please do it justice, fellers!

The 5 stars given are for the film itself which is remains uniquely satisfying: classic, yet refreshing and timeless. The Five Deadly Venoms is still cool and I've tried to turn friends on to it, usually by forcing them to watch it with me so that I can ""re-experience it"" thru their eyes! It's hard to define how much unconsciously bigger this movie is than its own genre. But it is. In a way, it stands alone. :-]

Rent it if possible. If not, approach with caution or wait for the eventual ""special edition"". Good luck.",1099872000,8,2921,4.730844793713163

939813,2,6304905386,"Recently I have developed an interest in kung fu movies after seeing the Kill Bill movies. I bought Fist of the White Lotus because of the good reviews it was given and because the character of Pai Mei was in it. I loved Fist because of its simple plot and great training/fighting scenes. I then decided to get Five Deadly Venoms because it was also on the top of most people's must-see kung fu lists. Unfortunately, I was sorely dissapointed. Venoms starts out great with an intriguing introduction to the FDV clan, but its all downhill from there. For one thing, there is almost no kung fu fighting in the entire movie except for the final fight. I certainly saw no ""nonstop wall-crawling action sequences"" as described in the Amazon.com review. What few fights there are only last a minute or so, and they do not effectively demonstrate the supposedly animal-like fighting techniques practised by the FDV clan. The movie genre is more of a who-dun-it than a kung fu film. The plot of the movie is centered in a courtroom where a judge is trying to find out who the killer was in a recent murder, but the dialogue and story are so boring that you don't really care to find out what happens in the end. The movie is only 95 minutes long, but it seems to drag on for about 3 hours. All in all, I, as a newly-introduced fan of kung-fu, was very un-entertained by all of this, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than hardcore enthusiasts.",1091232000,12,1442,4.486692015209125

I was engaged in the storyline, and the fighting. I don't have to explain what happened because all the other reviewers basically already did.
There wasn't much fighting in the movie, but just enough to keep you satisfied. I describe the fighting in this movie, a desert. Why? Because the fighting was a nice treat added to the story no matter how you cut it.
There was some torture/unusual styles of murders, but they were also like desert in this platter called ""5 Deadly Venoms"" They were sick, but also awesome in my opinion. I personally like the paper suffication, but that's just me.

939905,5,6304905386,"This one is a simple story that can get confusing, but has just the right stuff to keep the audience on track.  Instead of a revenge theme like we so commonly see in the kung-fu flicks.  Not that revenge themes are bad but it gives us a new taste to a different type of film.
Basically, a master has taught his pupils 5 deadly arts of Kung-fu all of which fit the the title 5 deadly venoms because the styles mimic animals that are poisonous.  The centipede, snake, toad, lizard, scorpion.  Hence the name ""poison clan"".  The master teaches all of these to pupils at different times and is only explained by the master as a sort of flashback but more of a background builder.  Each pupil mastered a specific style within the clan but do not know anything besides that style.  However, they know their own style very well.  Each style has it's own weaknesses but if one can know how to do them all they essetially complement each other and then one can have no weaknesses.  The master is telling this story to his pupil Yan Tieh who actually has a small role in the film even though his role is rather important because it actually sets things in motion.  The reason is the master has taught all of the tecniques to Yan but he doesnt know anyone technique very well and therefore he can be easily beaten by anyone of the 5 previous pupils.  His mission is to check up on the 5 pupils to see if they are doing good deeds with their skills.  As the story unfolds there are 2 who are obviously bad and are after a treasure and killing people left and right.  Only they screw up and use their skills and leave death marks of special kung-fu on the people they killed.  PLus to add to all the fun some innocent bystander witness thee murders.  2 others are less noticeable but are good and one later reveals himself who is actually an officer of the law (but you kind of figure this out because he get the lead role in the film).  The officer hides himself by using the Toad who is his friend to help caputure the bad guys which are centipede style and later the snake who actually has a feels sorry for his murders and centipde who could careless and wants to keep using his skills to kill people for money and status.  They succeed and a chain of events leads to an ultimate battle at the end because the scorpion actually finds the map to the treasure and later reveals himself as the wild card of the stack and plots to kill all of the clan members so he can be the most powerful and have all the gold.  Yan teams up with the officer who has the lizard skills and teaches Yan his style.  The toad is tortured to death because Snake and Centipede styles are behind the whole thing and have semi-control over the governing body.
Toad: strengths are iron skin style (it does exist in real life but well over dramatic in the movie of course).  The iron skin does not allow weapons and hand to hand combat strikes to cause damage to the person who trained toad style.  His weakness is his temples.
Lizard: Strengths are able to do wall kung-fu.  Able to strike like a lizard while standing on the wall.
Centipede:  Speed of attack is best of all the techniques and rest of the styles.
Snake: It's awkward floor (fighting while on the ground) and hand speed and cunning is its strengths.
Scorpion: Able to smash objects with great efficiency.  The powerhouse of the techniques.
You can tell putting all these together makes you basically invincible.
The wall-to-wall action makes the pace of the film fast and furious.  The unique kung-fu is fun to watch and the coreography is brilliant.  The best thing is the actors are very talented and very fast with their fighting.  Everyhing here looks very well done.

Quality-wise, this version by crash cinema is one of the best reproductions of Kung Fu theater films out there.

This film is spoken of with the same reverence that is afforded to ""Enter The Dragon"". There are better Shaw Brothers films (Super Ninjas is probably the best), but this one started the next Kung-Fu film craze.
The DVD quality is fair. The story is quite good, although a bit slow at points, but with a rousing conclusion.

Admittedly, the film could use a bit more action, but then there wouldn't have been time to develop the plot, which is thoughtful and conveys a solid and positive moral theme, culminating in a fine final battle.
A general word of caution: do not buy this, or any other DVD title for that matter, with the ""Telefilms International"" label.

939967,5,6304905386,"this film is a classic. the plot is good and the kung fu is inventive.
I starts off with the intro about a dying master who tells his last pupil of the venom styles he taught. The centipede style is very fast and agile, this is my fave. The snake style, (which looks really strange and isn't the snake style used in real kung fu) is fast and nimble, the scorpion uses his legs like scorpion pincers. The lizard can climb walls, (this is the worst part of the film) and the toad can resist any weapon peircing his skin (this is the secnd worst part of the film).
The last pupil goes to check on these five masters becasue the teacher was scared they might target an old school mate and steal his money.
shortly after Yan tieh arrives in the town where they are all living, Tang Sao Quai (Centipede) and Wei Pai (Snake) kill an entire family and wreck the house looking for the money. Then Ma (Scorpion) sneaks in after them and steals the map for the money that they didn't find.
The murder is reported to the court and the judge orders his two police officers Ho Yun Sin (Lizard) and Ma (Scorpion)to capture the killers. Ho meets up with Lie Ho (toad) and they capture the centipede for the murder.
However the snake and scorpion bribe the judge to frame the toad for the killing and they everntually, after an amazing fight scene between Wei Pai and Lo Mang kill the toad and pretend he committed suicide.
The Lizard was away during all this and when he comes back he is outraged. The two witnesses Lin Quan and Won Far have been killed by the centipede and snake so Yan Tieh teams up with the lizard to kill the two.
In an amazing end fight scene, the scorpion kills the snake and the snake kills the scorpion and the Lizard and Yan Tieh kill the centipede.

Its not a ""you killed my master, and i will avenge him..."" story (although, i like those too). But its more of a, guess who is who type story, thats right, youll be guessing too.
There are 5 martial artists, all have a distinct fighting style, all are named after animals (scorpion, centipede, snake, lizard, and toad) all are deadly, hence, 5 deadly venoms.  well, the deal is that they're all trained by the same master, but at different times, so as the story comes about, two of these venoms know each other, another two know each other, but they don't know any of the other venoms, and one venom doesnt know anyone at all.  get it?!  yeah, i knew you were with me.
so, when a venom turns bad, he/they must be eliminated, because they are very dangerous, ergo, search and destroy.  only, who is who?  who is/are the venoms?
I won't say anymore, but i will say that this was a damn good movie!  during the movie, i was feeling refreshed, because it was not your typical MA, flying kicks everywhere movie.  man, this was a mystery/suspense, you know the type you watch in the theater, in hopes of being confused or misled, but NOOOOOOO, you always know who is who?! yeah, well, this is more like clue. (the movie!)  you don't know who is who, you have ideas, but you're probably wrong, or are you?
The only complaint i had was with the volume, i bought the dvd version, and the volume was very low, no static or anything, just very low, i had to set my TV to the highest level, in terms of volume (it was okay then, i could hear everything just fine!)  however, the MA action is very good.  and the character development, was actually really good.  my favorite would have to be either toad or lizard, but scorpion had the badest kicks boy!  his legs just fly, they have a mind of their own, and its with strict form.  these guys are amazing, i believe they're known as the taiwan tigers or something of that nature.
I do strongly recommend this movie, its more mystery (like clue) then fighting.  My mum even watched it with me, and she hates violent movies, although strangely enough she seems to be glued to the tele when they're on. hmm, i wonder..!  boys and girls, get this one for sure, people say that this is the best of the kung fu flix of all time, i personally don't think its THE best, but its top (deadly) 5!
hey, also check out the Return of the 5 deadly venoms...its not the a sequel, nor is it about the 5 deadly venoms (they have no bearing on this movie, its a completely different movie), but it has the same guys who played the venoms acting in this movie...",993772800,6,2911,4.254083484573503

940078,4,6304905386,"You can add me to the nostalgia group, having seen this movie as an 11 year old in 1981 on a Saturday afternoon matinee.  I was quite thrilled to find the DVD a few days ago, having eschewed the then difficult to find VHS version.  DVD quality is pretty poor, but they were of course hampered going from a disintegrating master.  Ghosting and screen artifacts abound, but hey, that's really secondary to anyone who's been searching for this title for some time.  While formulaic in the genre sense, [dying master tells pupil to avenge him / right a wrong using every ounce of technique] the story is carried out in a much more sublime whodunit, as a teasing mystery with spurts of action.  The last of the Poison Clan practitioners [dying of course] commands young pupil to find the hidden money cache of an earlier teacher before his boundlessly corrupt former students do.  Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, and Toad already have a head start on our last pupil who hasn't mastered any one of the techniques mentioned, but is versed enough in all of them to be effective when combined w/ another.  The story progresses as the rich teacher is found in turn by the various factions. Centipede and Snake have teamed up as have Toad and Lizard.  The mysterious Scorpion does not make his true intentions known, skulking around in the darkness to pick up the pieces and sow dissent.  Slowly through the film, the members become clear and eventually fight one another which are the highlights.  Who will prevail, who will our young student pair with during the end game, and what of the Scorpion?  All answered in due time, well, actually in long drawn out periods of slack but when it does start cooking it certainly does.  My favorite: the fight between my preferred poison The Snake, and the Toad.  Watching and listening to the sound effects as the Snake struck, probing for weak points while the Toad would flex and bounce him off 10 feet was fun then and now.. and surprisingly mirrors the battles based on this scenario I would have with my 8 year old sister. Hah hah.  This is a definite cult classic, campy enough in later viewing that it doesn't take itself too seriously, but with enough action to satisfy new viewers too. Recommended.",985046400,31,2243,4.688775510204081
940079,5,6304905386,"I put this DVD in last night just to check out the quality of it. I didn't have any intentions of actually watching it, just wanted to look at the picture.
My mistake! Within 5 minutes I was sucked into this flick!  The costuming and sets are easy to place it as a B movie, but it's not.  Great dubbed voices, great Kung Fu action, and interesting plot make this movie one of the best Shaw Bros. movies ever.  If you are a martial arts film buff and don't already own this movie, why?
While the picture isn't that great, it is easily watchable, and the widescreen view lets you enjoy the action like it was meant to be.  It's a great price, add it to your collection.",981417600,6,667,4.1875
940117,3,6304905386,"5 Deadly Venoms is a great movie with an absorbing story where you can see 5 guys using 5 different fighting techniques: the centipede, the snake, the scorpion, the lizard and the toad. I especially liked the snake style.
Having said that, I must unfortunately comment on the poor quality of the DVD. It is the first time that I see dark violet bars instead of dark ones on a widescreen version of a film. And we can also see that the negative for the picture has quite aged over the years. A little restorating job would have been welcomed here.
That the quality of the picture isn't top-notch can be forgiven, but the sound is so bad at times that I can't pass this one up. There are times in the movie when I have to crank up the volume real high to understand what the actors are saying.
I hope (maybe in vain) that one day an important company gets the rights to the film and restore it to its just value. Until then...",979516800,4,924,4.255681818181818

The rawness of the somewhat off production values  only adds to the movie's atmosphere.  The martial arts and choreography are  simply amazing. Shaw brothers made many of those ""corny"" 70's  kung fu movies.
