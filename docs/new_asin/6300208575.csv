224043,4,6300208575,"Charlton Heston does an admirable job as Marc Antony in this 1970 version of Shakespeare's play.  Certainly you will come away from this film wishing he had performed more Shakespeare on film.  However, I must admit a strong preference for Marlon Brando's performance in the same role in the 1953 version of ""Julius Caesar,"" and especially the funeral scene where the performance of the mob is equal to that of the actor in the pulpit.  It would have been equally worthwhile to see Brando attempt more of the Bard as well.
I also find that across the board the acting is slightly better in the earlier version.  In this color version it is strange to see Jason Robards, Jr., who made his reputation performing the works of Eugene O'Neill on the stage, flounder so badly with Shakespeare, and I have to admit his performance gets in the way of my enjoyment of this film.  Of the other actors it is interesting to see John Gielgud take on the title role since he played the lean and hungry Cassius in the earlier version, a joy to see Diana Rigg nail her significant scene as Portia, and a bit disconcerting to see so many actors who would become television stars in the years to come (e.g., Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaugh and Carroll O'Connor).
I also prefer Joseph L. Mankiewicz's direction of the 1953 film to the work of Stuart Burge in this version.  Mankiewicz also had the advantage of Academy Award-winning art direction and set decoration, which I really think overcomes the fact the later version is in color.  If you are screening the entire film for students or focusing just on Antony's funeral oration, by either standard I really believe you are better served with the earlier film.",970012800,56,1698,4.696969696969697
224044,4,6300208575,"Much better than the earlier Julius Caesar, which starred Marlon Brando as Mark Antony and James Mason as Brutus.  In this version, Jason Robards as Brutus is admittedly an embarrassment, but the rest of the cast is quite  strong.  The delivery of Antony's funeral oration by Charlton Heston is  brilliant, powerful, well-paced, the dramatic high point of the movie.  Richard Johnson as Cassius, John Gielgud as Caesar, Robert Vaughn as Casca  and Diana Rigg as Portia are fine actors, with full dramatic presence, at  home in Shakespeare's language.  Brief parts, like the soothsayer's and the  cobbler's, are memorably played.  The screenplay omits two short passages  that are important to the plot: (1) Cassius' avowal in the first act, after  his attempt to persuade Brutus to oppose Caesar, that if their positions  were reversed and he, Cassius, stood as well with Caesar as Brutus does and  Brutus made a comparable appeal to him, he would certainly not listen.  (2)  Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's  servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the  Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill  him also, that he is in no danger of their doing so.",936489600,81,1247,4.995121951219512
224078,5,6300208575,"I picked up this version of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" because I have Charlton Heston in ""Antony & Cleopatra"" & I also have & love Bernard Shaw's ""Caesar & Cleopatra"" & since they are all filmed in color & Bernard Shaw's ""Caesar & Cleopatra"" is very Shakespearian I watch them like a trilogy!!!  I find I agree with half the other review's which claim Jason Robard's performance is lacking in this adaptation.  And I find this odd because as a actor I know he is fully capable of adding believable fire & energy to his performance which makes me wonder what may have been going on in his life while working on this film!  But for me it was worth Amazon.com's affordable price to create my full color trilogy of ""Caesar & Cleopatra"" ""Julius Caesar"" & "" Antony & Cleopatra""!!!  I have wanted to view these three movies back to back for years & now I can indulge my guilty pleasure!!!  I was not disappointed they worked well together.

Effective and satisfying on most levels, especially the assignation scene wherein Caesar is betrayed and stabbed to death by his trusted

224085,5,6300208575,"I highly recommend this movie for its accurate movie adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of Julius Caesar and for the outstanding acting of Charlton Heston.  I would agree with others that Heston was simply born or destined to play characters of epic natures, either Biblical or of a secular nature.  The acting of Robards is weak which ironically plays into the idea of Brutus being a pathetic character.  Lastly, the movie should encourage the reading of history from Plutarch which Shakespeare used for his play.  I encourage reading Plutarch's biography of Julius Caesar which will  certainly make one's hair rise.",1419465600,,623,5.19
224086,4,6300208575,"In 1970, this Stuart Burge-directed, Robert Furnival-scripted new widescreen color version of the play was released with Charlton Heston reprising the Antony part (he had acted in an early 1950 version), and John Gielgud taking over our title role (he had played Casca in the 1953 Brando version). In the role of Brutus, we get the respected American actor Jason Robards with Diana Rigg as Portia, and Robert Vaughn as Casca.

Burge fills his film with some fine touches: a prologue set on an old battlefield showing us the toll of war; a wonderfully vain Caesar who at one point even preens before a mirror, but whose sense of foreboding is almost prophetic--theres an almost knowing glance between him and Cassius when the soothsayer delivers his warning. If Caesar is vain, then Richard Johnsons Cassius is disgruntled and bitter, while Vaughans Casca looks like nothing more than a decade-early forerunner of Belushis John Blutarsky at the Delta Houses toga party. But hes deeper than that: when the conspirators debate the location of the rising son, he points his sword at the rising son (S-O-N) , Brutus.

And Hestons intervening two decades has given him the physical and presentational gravitas to make this Antony great. Heston simply kicks ass in this role.

This all sounds great, doesnt it? Like its one for the ages. Theres only one problem, and his name is Brutus. Robards is a black hole at the center of the film--wooden, stiff, dull...the portrayal is so boring, Im falling asleep just thinking about it. It makes almost every one of his scenes unwatchable. I mean, even Diana Rigg, pretty much at the peak of her heat as an actress, can barely make you pay attention to Portias scene with Brutus. And she gets neither the voluntary wound speech or semi-comic scene with Lucius at the end of Act Two.

Burge also does some interesting things with perspective: we see Calpurnias dream, we see much of the assassination from Caesars point of view, and the camera from within the crowd shows the terrifying actions of the mob after Antonys masterful swaying of the citizenry during his funeral oration, though we don't see the Cinna the poet sequence.

Its a solid production in which no character comes off particularly positive or likeable. After the funeral, Antony and Octavius (played by a very young Richard Chamberlain) come off as spoiled, privileged party boys, getting massages while discussing the division of the empire, and kicking back before battles.

Except for Robards, this is a VERY good Caesar. Just be prepared to be dumbfounded by his performance.",1418169600,,2584,4.942396313364055
224087,1,6300208575,"Wanted to like this version, but most of the lead actors (Heston and Robards in particular) are too old for the characters they portray and it throws balance of the whole film off.",1417910400,,180,4.484848484848484

Should be viewed as a companion film to Heston's 1972 follow up, playing the same character in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (another excellent film version of the Bard).

This was one of the Julius Caesar movies I used for my class on Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Charleton Heston is closest to Shakespeare's conception of Mark Antony.  Richard Johnson as Cassius is also notable in his role.  Unfortunately for Dianna Rigg, she plays Portia opposite a Robards that has the emotional depth of a can opener.  Why they picked him for Brutus, only the gods and idiot Hollywood producers knows.  He does get better as the movie progresses.  Maybe somebody was using a cattle prod on him.",1401062400,,671,4.833333333333333
224132,3,6300208575,"Gaius Julius Caesar may have had the most dramatic assassination in history... or at least it seems that way, since almost everyone knows it through the lens of William Shakespeare.

And it's hard to imagine a better actor to play him than the late Sir John Gielgud, who took the role of the famed Roman statesman in a star-studded 1970 adaptation. Christopher Lee, Diana Rigg, Charlton Heston and Richard Chamberlain all give excellent performances as well, but the movie is hampered by a stiff and clunky Brutus and an instantly forgettable Cassius.

Julius Caesar (Gielgud) is returning to Rome in triumph, only to be stopped by a strange old soothsayer who warns him, ""Beware the ides of March."" Caesar brushes off the warning, mainly because he has no idea that a conspiracy is brewing under his nose. In a nutshell, a group of senators led by the creepy Cassius (Richard Johnson) are plotting against Caesar because of his wild popularity, suspecting that he wants to become KING. Cue the horror sting.

Jealous Cassius' latest convert is Brutus (Jason Robards), one of Caesar's best buddies -- he immediately begins plying Brutus with tales of how Caesar is manipulating the masses. Brutus is slowly swayed over to the conspiracy's side, beginning to believe that Caesar as a great man corrupted by power. Everything comes to a a devastating assassination on... guess when... the ides of March, which will elevate some men to greatness and destroy others.

A star-studded adaptation of Shakespeare is a tricky thing,  because it will either be a magnificent tour de force... or a celebrity pet project by people who aren't up to the challenge. For the most part, the 1970 ""Julius Caesar"" is the former, as smaller roles are given to actors who are beautifully suited to the role -- you can see Diana Rigg as Brutus' passionate wife Portia, and Christopher Lee as that poor schmuck who tries to warn Caesar of his impending assassination. These roles are the less splashy ones, but the actors' charisma makes them leap off the screen.

And of course, Gielgud is simply perfect as Caesar -- regal, charismatic, with an air of warm wisdom and yet capable of steely, cold-hearted resolve. He has only a few scenes, but you glimpse many dimensions during that time. And Charlton Heston makes an amazing Marc Antony, despite some really odd clothes and a bad red wig -- he's capable of being passionate and cynical, clever and vibrant. You can tell that Heston really threw his soul into this role.

Here's the problem: since most of the movie's scenes revolve around Brutus, any production of ""Julius Caesar"" requires an excellent actor as Brutus. This movie... does not have it. Robards gives a planklike, mushmouthed performance as Brutus. And he reacts very strangely during the more intense scenes -- he looks almost embarrassed, like a kid in a school play.

Unfortunately, this causes many of the scenes to feel awkward and stiff as well, particularly the ones where Brutus is the dominant presence. It's incredibly awkward to see Diana Rigg giving a powerful performance opposite Robards; it's like watching her repeatedly running into a wall. The movie feels like a patchwork at times -- some scenes are clunky and stiff, while the ones that rely on Heston and Gielgud are rich and passionate, with lots of nuance.

One thing that cannot be criticized is the dialogue -- Shakespeare's  speeches are powerful and intense, particularly Antony's famous speech to the Roman people (""The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones""), but Brutus' impassioned argument with Portia (""You have some sick offence within your mind"") and Cassius' oily slanted editorials about Caesar. It also goes for shock and blood during the actual assassination, horrifying you after so many scenes of verbal plotting.

And as a random point, a llama is seen during the opening credits. Apparently the people who made this movie do not know where llamas are naturally found. Hint: nowhere that ancient Rome had access to.

The 1970 adaptation of ""Julius Caesar"" suffers from some miscasting among the conspirators -- Gielgud and Heston gave magnificent performances, but many scenes are dragged down by an unfortunate Brutus. Worth watching, despite its flaws.",1400457600,,4280,4.987377279102384

Remember that this is a low budget film made more than sixty years ago. Closeups of the hemets and armor are cringeworthy, but Shakespeare avoided as much of the fighting as he could. The exterior shots of battle action show good location use.

When plugging the 1970 version on the Tonight Show, he mentioned this one, along with showing a still or two. It's Julius Caesar okay, extremely condensed, but, a fine effort. The main reason I wanted to see it, though, was for the Chicago filming locations. Most articles just say it was filmed on the steps of the Field Museum. Not exactly. Much of it was filmed on the steps and balconies of the Museum of Science and Industry, formerly the Rosenwald Museum. However, the building itself, which was the Palace of Fine Arts, leftover from the Columbian Exposition, was the first home of the Field Museum of Natural History. Now, thanks to a local PBS Chicago Lakefront travelogue, I learned the interior scenes were filmed in the rotunda of the Elks Memorial building by Lincoln Park. The outdoor battle scenes are a question mark. Filmed on one of the several sand dune beaches, near Chicago. Probably in Indiana. If you're familiar with the story, and a fan of indie films, you'll love this as an addition to your collection.

Despite its being in color compared to the stark black & white of its predecessor, it's like comparing a high school presentation of Shakespeare to one of the very best professional performances of JC ever put on.  The earlier Joseph M. version was also crowned by one of the greatest film scores of all time by the incomparable Miklos Rozsa who was nominated for an Academy Award.  That was also the first film recorded in stereo, though the original Overture was replaced (temporarily) by ""Capricio Italiano"" (another foolish move by a Hollywood producer). The only standouts in this one were Diana Rigg as Portia and Richard Chamberlain (always underrated) as Octavian.  Brando's Antony has never been given its proper due only because Brando was associated with other, much different roles.  Nevertheless, Brando, James Mason, and the aforementioned Gielgud stole the show and devoured the scenery.  Save your money.  Rent or buy the MGM/Brando version.  Forget this one.

Expect it to be the exact same quality as the VHS edition most schools have, just on DVD.  I found the picture to be perfectly acceptable once they chopped and zoomed up to ratio after the opening credits , and the sound quality was way better than our school's worn out VHS edition.

As for the acting, you can get that story from any review.  Robards isn't all that great in it.  That said, your standard high school kids don't notice because they're too busy trying to figure out what he's saying to care about how he's saying it.  If you teach advanced students with an appreciation of acting, perhaps the black and white Brando version would work better; otherwise, the fact it's in color makes this one better at holding a class's attention.

Richard Chamberlain, despite his short time on screen, is certainly worth seeing as Octavius.  He's got a grin that perfectly matches the young, super-confident nature of his character.",1303776000,3,1146,4.69
224192,4,6300208575,"I just caught this late last night, but wound up staying awake afterwards, so chilling and stirring is this movie. Whether this is how Julius Caesar should be performed is another issue, but given the magnificence of the play, and the importance of the story historically, perhaps a blood and guts approach is an alternative to the overly reserved Shakespeare we usually get, and even to the first great Hollywood version, which I still prefer. Of course, everyone who says Jason Robards is miscast is correct. In fact in the Act IV tent recrimination argument with Cassius he finally comes boldly to life-it's just that the extreme emotionalism he displays is the antithesis of what Shakespeare is trying to convey in Brutus' somewhat dysfunctional, almost clinically depressive albeit intellectual personality. Yet, James Mason, whom I prefer, is almost too cool and reserved. A certain degree of angst and indecision has to be part of Brutus, which I always felt Mason doesn't adequately convey. The conspirators need Brutus but do we, or more importantly he, know why he acts as he does. Remember Montaigne's acknowledgement that he himself doesn't know why he acts or thinks as he does. Remember, too that Cicero, invited to participate in the conspiracy declares ""men may construe things after their fashion (a double meaning) clean from the purpose of the things themselves."" I have always taken Shakespeare, especially Julius Caesar, to be a combination of Montaigne (skepticism) and Machiavelli (Realpolitik, and an aversion to Scholasticism and Platonism) something that Kenneth Clark talked about in Civilization. Julius Caesar the play must combine these elements and at the same time convey a true historical tragedy. The 'Brando/Gielgud"" version gives us this duality but perhaps is a bit too genteel. This latter version errs on the side of too much splenetics, and fireworks. As for the rest of the cast Charlton Heston is magnificent, especially in the funeral oration. Let's face it: Brando mumbled and he was a bit too obvious in the way he played to the crowd. Heston is genuinely upset and yet you believe that as Antony he is still composed enough to use his wiles and oratorical skills to sway that crowd. Richard Johnson is terrific, but of course nobody could ever compare to Gielgud's ice cold Cassius. In fact, Gielgud isn't as good as Caesar, and I somewhat prefer Calhern's cool bravado. The rest of the cast is equally good in both versions. I am buying the DVD so my comments will have to await watching it as to quality; this is a review of the movie itself.",1287100800,2,2590,4.970046082949309
224193,3,6300208575,"This ill-regarded adaptation still deserves better than the treatment it gets here in a full screen version with no hint of restoration.  Much of the acting is lively and there's a first-rate Michael J. Lewis score.  Heston brings his patented lofty arrogance to Antony.  (It's a pity his lone directorial effort of Antony and Cleopatra seems lost to time.)  Robert Vaughn is a crafty Casca and best of all the underrated Richard Johnson is a sensational Cassius.  Once he dies, all the life goes out of the picture.  On the debit side is the too effete Caesar of Sir John, he's out of place amid the raging testosterone.  And oh, that Robards.  To be fair, his funeral speech is pretty good, and his big fight with Cassius is excellent.  Everywhere else, it's like he's sleepwalking.  It's really strange to watch.  Rarely can one see a great actor with great material being so awful.

Also, the credits list Christopher Lee and Andre Morrell, neither of whom I spotted, and I think Chris is pretty hard to miss.  They also list someone in the role of Cina the Poet, and I didn't catch that scene either.",1269734400,2,1105,4.634020618556701

224196,4,6300208575,"I feel as though I need to stick up for this version of Shakespeare's play.  After teaching this play for almost ten years, I have read it over forty times and seen the 1953 movie version at least that often.  However, I watched the Robards-Heston version for the first time this fall.  Though I do like the older black-and-white movie, I have always felt that the director (and James Mason) misread Brutus, just as most people seem to do.  Brutus is not noble and has very few redeeming qualities even outside of the fact that he betrayed Caesar.  He is easily manipulated, vain, and dishonest with others and with himself.  He is a man who does not know his own mind (as Cassius does).  When he berates Cassius for taking bribes and shaking down the locals (Act IV), his self-righteous platitudes collapse under the weight of his real concern - namely that Cassius is not sharing the money with him so that he can pay his soldiers (because he is just too honest to steal).  He consistently makes bad decisions after hijacking the conspiracy (letting Anthony live, letting Anthony speak at the funeral, letting Anthony speak after him rather than before, marching to meet Antony's and Octavius's troops and yielding the high ground, etc), misreads the people around him, and ultimately puts himself first rather than the Rome he whines about wanting to protect.  The genius of this play is not in Brutus's tortured soul struggling to balance his love of Caesar versus his love of Rome; instead it is in Shakespeare's brilliant ability at misdirection (for lack of a better term).  I enjoyed this movie precisely because I think Robards was trying mightily to depict a Brutus who was more than a bit vain and shallow - a wooden figure in over his head being manipulated by those around him.  I am not sure he always pulls this off, but I do think that an actor trying to create a Brutus who wants to seem the savior but who is actually an ""empty toga"" deserves more credit than one who plays a ""traditional"" but inaccurate ""tragic hero"" (as Mason does).  While his performance is hit-and-miss I really appreciate that he gives us a Brutus to contrast to the earlier film.  Some of the best classroom discussions I have ever had concerning this play have come this week when letting the students compare and contrast scenes from each film. (Plus I always have a soft spot for Heston.  I was fortunate to meet him briefly at a function about 12 years ago.  I said little more than ""Hello"" but I did get to shake his hand and have a picture taken.)

A very good movie for those looking to see a different, and I think more accurate rendition of this wonderful play.",1259712000,9,2662,4.608050847457627
224197,2,6300208575,"I watched the 1953 Marlon Brando version last weekend, and I just finished watching the 1970 Charlton Heston version today.  Even though the 1970 version is in color with better production quality, the black and white 1953 Marlon Brando version with antiquated scenery is a better movie.  The 1953 version also had much better casting.  This includes the roles of Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius.  The only actor in the 1970 version that was better than the 1953 version was Sir John Gielgud's Caesar.  Ironically, John Gielgud played Cassius in the 1953 version and Caesar in the 1970 version.  He was superb in both roles.  I was disappointed with Lewis Calhern's Caesar in the 1953 version.  The 1953 version of Julius Caesar was superior in almost every way that matters.

There is a reason the Brando version costs $13.99 and the Heston version costs $8.99.  If you have to choose between the two, buy the $13.99 version.",1249084800,3,927,4.8471337579617835
224250,4,6300208575,""" JULIUS CAESAR "", by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE; 1970 Movie Version Review:

SIR JOHN GIELGUD as Julius Caesar proved that he is a master of his craft;
DIANA RIGG (Portia, M. Brutus' wife), DEREK GODFREY (the cunning Decius Brutus), and JILL BENNETT (Calpurnia, J. Caesar's wife) were also all very good.  But,

RICHARD JOHNSON's volitile portrayal of Gaius Cassius STOLE THE SHOW as one of SHAKESPEARE's best antagonists in this classical drama.

CHARLTON HESTON (Marc Antony) would also have been very good, but his entire performance was upstaged by that ridiculous red wig he wore... what were they thinking?  An Irish Marcus Antonius?

JASON ROBARDS is historically a very capable Ocsar-winning actor.  However, cast as Marcus Brutus here, he delivered SHAKESPEARE's emotionally-charged dialogue in a boring, almost annoying monotone voice.
The only emotion he showed in the whole movie was in his ""war-of-words"" with Cassius (RICHARD JOHNSON) in the tent before the Battle of Phillipi.

ROBERT VAUGHN apparently honed some good acting skills after being ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" on TV, and delivered a surprisingly fine portrayal of the devious Senator/Conspirator Casca.  And,

RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN was competent as Octavian Augustus Caesar (which is not much of a role in this play); but as a wise thespian named Kildare once said, ""there are no small roles, only small doctors"".

It's a MYSTERY who portrayed GAIUS LIGARIUS, the play's eighth Senator/Conspirator seen in this movie.  Neither the character nor the actor are named in the credits, on DVD, VHS, in the movie's website, or on IMDb.  The Invisible RoMan?

STUART BURGE as Director turned in a production equal to his 1965 movie version of Shakespeare's OTHELLO, with Sirs Laurence Olivier and Derek Jacobi.

ROBERT FURNIVAL's Adapted Screenplay was basically true to SHAKESPEARE.
KENNETH HIGGINS' Cinematography was first-rate and visually appealing.

OVERALL, I rate this production a 7.5 on a ten-scale.

ONE FINAL FOOTNOTE: SIR JOHN GIELGUD was also in the cast of the 1953 movie version of JULIUS CAESAR, with Marlon Brando and James Mason.  He portrayed Gaius Cassius brilliantly.  And, yes, CASSIUS stole the show in that version as well.  I recommend you watch both of them !

224254,2,6300208575,"Despite its full title, Shakespeare's THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR has long been recognized as centering on the tragedy of Marcus Brutus. For one thing, Caesar dies before the play is even half over; for another, Brutus is a good man who brings about his own downfall by his own mistakes. Shakespeare's script contains numerous scenes that provide direct and indirect evidence that Brutus is worthy of the audience's respect and admiration. In most productions, therefore, it has been crucial that the actor playing Brutus do so in a manner that holds the audience's attention and causes the audience to care deeply about the misfortune he is bringing down upon himself.

This 1970 film, JULIUS CAESAR, is fairly well cast in all its parts but the key one--Jason Robards as Brutus. Two actors with very minor parts are noteworthy for their skills--Lawrence Harrington as the Carpenter and Ron Pembler as the Cobbler--at the opening of the play. Of the main characters, John Gielgud as Caesar and Richard Johnson as Cassius are both excellent. Diana Rigg as Brutus's beautiful and faithful wife Portia, Robert Vaughn as an ironic eye-rolling Casca, and Richard Chamberlain as a calculating Octavius are more than adequate. And Charlton Heston does a reasonably good job as Mark Antony, although director Stuart Burge often seems more concerned with displaying Heston's ""Roman-nose"" profile and his semi-clad physique (in a G-string in one scene) than with his histrionic talents.

Robards is virtually sleepwalking throughout most of the film, usually sounding as if he has no understanding of the words he is speaking and often stumbling through them the way some high school freshman might if suddenly told to read Elizabethan blank verse for the first time in his life. In only a few of the later scenes does Robards seem to come half to life. The effect of his exceedingly weak performance is to shift the audience's attention, by default, onto Mark Antony (whom Robards often calls ""Mark Anthony"")--and Shakespeare's play is almost morphed into a kind of Victory-of-Antony celebration. It is as if, as the old clich runs, ""the tail is wagging the dog."" (The only comparable misconstruing of a major Shakespearian tragedy that I can recall was when, in a 1970 ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" TV production, Richard Chamberlain played Hamlet as such a pitifully and dangerously out-of-control maniac that the actor Richard Johnson, playing Hamlet's uncle/stepfather as a calm, brave, and rational man, often gained most of the audience's sympathy--and the play almost became ""The Tragedy of King Claudius."")

It appears that once this film was completed, Republic Entertainment's marketing division decided to focus primarily on Heston as Mark Antony, reinforcing the impression that Robards' Brutus is indeed a subordinate character. Posters and virtually every box containing videos and DVDs of this production feature pictures of either Heston's face alone or Heston's face four times larger than the faces of Robards, Guelgud, Chamberlain, and Diana Rigg--as well as giving Heston's name top billing.

I titled my review ""Chiefly Useful to Would-Be Actors"" because I believe that some novice actors might learn how to speak Shakespeare's lines properly by hearing how NOT to do so from Robards' terrible example. Except for diehard fans of Heston, Richard Chamberlain, Diana Rigg, etc., most other viewers would do far better buying/renting Joseph L.

224258,4,6300208575,"For any version of William Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR to be a success, the actor playing Marcus Antonius must give an outstanding ""I've come to bury Caesar"" soliloquy. Charlton Heston does exactly this-- his emotionally-charged and finely-timed rendition of a most crucial speech is superb and leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind of the underlying message being conveyed to Romans who have lent him their ears. On so many levels, Heston in fact -is- this great Shakespearean anti-hero.

That Jason Robards was miscast as Marcus Junius Brutus is an opinion held even by Mr. Heston himself. Robards' quiet, self-involved portrayal of Brutus may not immediately serve the story's needs, but later, the contrast between an indecisive Brutus and the take-charge Antony is that much better delineated, due entirely to Robards supposedly vague approach. His Brutus, as played against Heston is appropriate; in fact, Robards should be given more credit for a daring interpretation of this complex character.

Excellent Technicolor photography, a nicely unobtrusive score and top notch casting make this ""Julius Caesar"" an elegant and memorable film.

My class is watching this as I write this review, and while I will show it again, I will only use it as a comparison to Brando's version.  The acting, with the exception of Caesar, Calpurnia, and Portia, is horrible.  I have never in my life seen such bad acting as I have seen with Brutus.  Robards does a horrible job, and where he actually shows some emotion - in the argruement with Cassius - it is too little too late.

Students have told me that had they watched this version first, they would have completely lost interest in the play.  The only thinkg they like about it are the crowd scenes.  They are the only thing that, to them, is more realistic.  I reccommend only if you are showing this as a companion, not as the main movie to help catch their attention.

224298,4,6300208575,"This is the 1970 movie of JULIUS CAESAR, starring Charlton Heston as Antony.

To my mind, it's every bit as good as the earlier, b&w version with Marlon Brando as Antony, though the later BBC version directed by Herbert Wise (who made I, CLAUDIUS) may be the best of the lot, partly because it renders the play virtually uncut. (It's available at Amazon in the set ""BBC Shakespeare Tragedies DVD Giftbox"".)

All three versions have strong points and weaknesses. The biggest weakest here is the strangely mis-calibrated performance by Jason Robards as Brutus; I think he intended to project quiet fortitude in the first half of the play, but he seems to be moving in a trance. Much better is the Casca of Robert Vaughn (yes, the Man from U.N.C.L.E.), a young and dashing Richard Chamberlain as Octavius, and John Gielgud as Caesar.

The production is visually pleasing, with sets and costumes that for the most part are historically accurate but sometimes have a slight Elizabethan touch, as if to remind us of the play's origins.

BTW, the spelling of Shakespear without a final e is not incorrect; this is a variant of the name which is actually the preferred spelling in some countries.

Footnotes: Before his official movie debut in the early 1950s, Heston played the role of Antony in an independent production of JULIUS CAESAR, which is now available on DVD, and he again played Antony when he directed his own, quite excellent movie version of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (which, alas, is not available on DVD as of 2006.)",1158019200,3,1521,4.812260536398467

224331,1,6300208575,"I bought this version to augment our homeschool study of Julius Caesar because it had so many actors whom I recognized.  But right from the opening credits, I could not read the blurry titles or names, and I eventually gave up because my eyes got tired from squinting in an unconscious effort to try to bring  this hopelessly poor-quality film into focus.  I wondered if it was a pirated copy.  On the other hand, what I saw of it was just what I wanted: vintage actors trying their hand at a kind of acting I have rarely seen most of them do.  I was expecting a fine performance from John Geilgud, and was not disappointed.  Diana Rigg was reasonable as Portia. Robert Vaughan's excellent Casca was a very pleasant surprise, quite a change of pace since the last time I saw him he was the Man from U.N.C.L.E. As for Jason Robards, he and Shakespeare should just avoid each other;  Robard's performance was wooden and his lines delivered in a flat voice. Still, what I saw of it was good, nostalgic fun, and I truly regret having to return the DVD; but in the end, I could not watch it because of the poor quality of the filming.",1144972800,8,1129,4.399038461538462

224333,4,6300208575,"But the rest of the movie is good.  It doesn't have the severity of the Brando version by Mankiewicz, with tough old Louis Calhern as Caesar and Satanic Edmond O'Brien as Casca.  That was in a stark, nearly noir black and white--even the red hair of Mankiewicz' leading ladies Deborah Kerr and Greer Garson was muted to a silvery gray that served them ill.  In this sixties rendition, the colorful hills of Rome call back fond memories of Zeffirelli's stagings of ROMEO and TAMING OF THE SHREW.  Unfortunately the DVD gives us an inadequate and misleading account of most of the colorful setups, which on screen were a beauty photographed by Ken Higgins, the man who brought us Swinging England with his location work on GEORGY GIRL and DARLING.

Stuart Burge, the director, had a spotty career, but for a while he was on a roll and he was Olivier's favorite director for a bit.  He directed the film of UNCLE VANYA with Olivier and Michael Redgrave, as well as Olivier's unbelievably hammy take on the Moor of Venice in OTHELLO.  I wonder if Olivier was busy when Burge was hired for Othello, or if Heston kind of bumped Olivier out of the way.  Surely Olivier would have made a more suitable Brutus than did our own homeboy Jason Robards Jr. whose performance has got to be in the hall of shame, hopelessly conceived, and possibly executed while he was drunk.  There's no other explanation for how bad he is.

Charlton Heston, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaughn otherwise make you think that Americans can really take Shakespeare in stride.  It's a shame we didn't see Heston in more Shakespearean parts.  He can be a terribly good actor, and even in bad parts is pretty persuasive.  This is his Planet of the Apes Mark Antony, fully committed to saving the world for the human beings.  I enjoyed the movie, but in some parts you'll be stupefied by the shoffy condition of the release, and by Robards' bottom of the barrel (or bottle?) take on Brutus.",1123459200,9,1953,4.65597667638484

I could of had better results had I used my camera phone to record this moveie.  On may levels my students were disappointed as was I!  My advice to English teachers everywhere is buy the Marlon Version-at least there is some good acting! I want my money back!",1113868800,10,562,4.407766990291262
224335,1,6300208575,"One of the curiosities of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" is that the main character is not ""Julius Caesar"", who is killed early in the play, nor Marc Antony, who has by far the best and most famous speech - ""Friends,Romans, countrymen, ..."".

  The central character is Brutus, the ""noblest Roman of them all"", who must balance his his duty toward Rome against his loyalty to Caesar.  Brutus is a follower of the Stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals, rather than being lead by his emotions.  It seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having Jason Robards, a highly skilled actor, deliver all Brutus's lines in a bored flat undertone.  I wonder how they persuaded him to do it?

  ""Don't act Jason.  Trust us.  Just read the lines off slowly

  like you never saw them before and you don't care a pin.

  It'll be great.!""

  To say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement. Mr. Spock has a wider emotional range.  They would have done better and saved money by having Brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the HAL 9000.

When Brutus is off screen the movie is fine.  Heston is surprisingly good.  Gielgud is great. It is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes, the cheap sets, the worst fake beard in the history of cinema. If you want to see a much better film version, there is the classic black and white version in whcih James Mason and Sir John Gielgud make a superb pair as Brutus and Casius, and  Marlon Brando gives a chilling Antony.

As for this one, if someone gives it to you as a present, by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library.",1110844800,24,1771,4.372307692307692
224336,2,6300208575,"If you're a huge fan of Heston's or of this superb play, you might want to suffer through this terrible print.
It's blurry, the colors blur and flash like a bad animation, and it sounds like it was recorded underwater with a megaphone. It's really a piece of crap.
The performances are good, and because it's the only other film version of the play, (that I can find) they warrant comparison with the 1958 Brando version. Heston's needlessly pompous and swaggering Antony is occasionally amusing and occasionally pretty good, but ultimately the performance lacks the authenticity and verve of Brando's, and one can't help but compare. Robards's Brutus is stoic and tortured and it is something like torture to watch him act, at least for the first half of the film. By the time Brutus is heading up the wrong end of the civil war, Robards aptly transforms Brutus into a man whose passions have fermented to the surface. It's by turns a flat, interesting, and jarring performance accented by an occasional flash of brilliance, such as the scene in which Brutus and Cassius argue about funds and bribes. Much of the supporting cast: Diana Rigg, Gielgud, and Robert Vaughn, in particular are excellent.
 It's a shame really that this is such a horrifying print (the worst in fact that I've ever seen), because this was a good movie once. Somewhere through the blur you can make out decent production values: large crowd and battle scenes, attractive costumes, and what looks like the hilly Italian countryside. Who knows maybe even the ""seven hills,"" though I doubt even a Roman native would be able to tell for sure.",1085616000,11,1614,4.8267148014440435
224337,2,6300208575,"I ordered this DVD for use in teaching the play. Though I had anticipated it for months and waited with impatience for its release, I now find I was impatient for mediocrity. The performances are disappointing, with only Richard Chamberlain as Octavious showing any passion in his performance. Indeed, Jason Robards as Brutus illustrated the poorest Shakespearean acting I've yet seen, and it's an embarassment for anyone attempting to light a fire for Shakespeare in teenagers. Robards speaks his lines as if he is reading them for the first time on his couch at home.

Until Hollywood gives this another try, I recommend the BBC version of the play available with English subtitles from Ambrose Video. Of course, there is always the Brando version of the play with James Mason doing a much more credible job than Robards as Brutus.",1085616000,11,833,4.95

What was he thinking?  Oh, and of course, the makers of this DVD thought they were doing Rome a favour by assasinating the picture: formatted to fit your screen is the way they put it, like they were doing you a favour.

224380,4,6300208575,"Not a bad version at all of Shakespeare's play. Most of the attention for Julius Caesar is clearly with the 1950s version, but this one holds up as well. In this version, Charlton Heston plays Antony. Others include Jason Richards (Brutus), John Gielgud (Caesar), Richard Johnson (Cassius), Robert Vaughn (Casca), Richard Chamberlain (Octavius), and Diana Riggs (Portia).
In this story, Brutus comes forth as the tragic hero who joins the conspiracy to kill the ambitious Roman, Julius Caesar. Shakespeare's story delves much into the realm of politics within the Roman society. Brutus' tragic flaw is perhaps that he sees too much of the benevolent side of people and society; he gives in to help Rome only after pondering deeply the plan of Cassius, and ""trusts"" Antony to not give a stirring speech (big mistake there). He still considers Caesar a ""good"" man, but justifies his role in the conspiracy as for the common good of Rome.  A tale that definitely concerns itself with justification, or lack thereof, of removing leaders from political positions, and the consequences those actions bring unto an entire nation and their citizens.
The set design, background and acting are true to the play. One of the differences between this and the Brando version is the scene in which Caesar is assassinated. It is far more bloody and gruesome (yet the movie is rated G, go figure). Heston, as Antony,  does a decent job with the ""Countrymen, lend me your ears"" speech, making an emotional appeal to the crowd as a friend of Caesar. He stirs up the rage among the Romans in this emotional appeal on Caesar's behalf. Eventually, he will go to war against two of the leaders of the conspiracy, Cassius and Brutus.
This is definitely worth a view, especially if you are a Shakespeare fan. This also is an excellent resource for the study of Julius Caesar.

224382,5,6300208575,"Pardon the pun - actually that would be Brutus with the coup d'etat - ""the most unkindest cut of all.""
Behind Hamlet, Julius Caesar emerges as the foremost tragedy that has brought us so many great axioms and lines that we still use today some 400 years after the fact.  After reading the beloved play for the 2nd time, I then watched this superb movie version for the 2nd time.  It is impossible to overstate the incredible acting talent and the splendid performance enacted by the vibrant Charlton Heston as Marc Antony.  His dynamic and electrifying speech to the plebians in the marketplace rivals any other in Shakespeare cinema history(including Olivier in Hamlet and Branagh in Henry V).
Not to be outdone, Sir John Gielgud superbly plays an arrogant and imperious version of Caesar while Jason Robards stoically plays the ""noble"" Brutus.  As a self-proclaimed Shakespeare aficionado, I thoroughly reveled in this version of Julius Caesar and highly recommend it to those who appreciate fine drama.",1038787200,7,1005,5.036144578313253
224383,5,6300208575,"Charlton Heston's delivery of Mark Antony's funeral oration alone powers this production beyond the 1953 Brando version. Richard Johnson is superb as Cassius, and the beauty and spectacle of the Battle of Philippi in Act V is icing on the cake. Some have complained about the flat delivery of Brutus' lines by Jason Robards, but I find Robards' restraint in keeping with Brutus' character as a disciple of Stoicism. If you are a teacher, and you want your students to feel the emotional force of Antony's speech in Act III, as well as the sweep and drama of Acts IV and V, this is the version to show them.",1022198400,4,606,4.568807339449541
224384,2,6300208575,"Unfortunately, this version is far short of the Marlon Brando version, which I rate with 5 stars. The fault is not in the casting of Heston versus Brando as Anthony. Both are outstanding. Heston may give an even better rendition of the funeral oration than Brando, though perhaps Brando is stronger in the rest of the play. Both versions benefit from the presence of Gielgud, whose lean and hungry energy drives Cassius throughout the 1953 version, and who is a strong Caesar here. But the earlier version perhaps profits more because Cassius is the more significant role, and Louis Calhern was also an imperial Caesar in 1953. Diana Rigg is outstanding in this version, but Deborah Kerr was also outstanding in the earlier movie. The superiority of the 1953 film lies elsewhere. Everyone in the 1953 cast was outstanding, including all the minor roles, which is not true here. This version suffers greatly by comparison. And the direction of the 1953 film was superb; in this version it's lackluster. Even the black and white of the earlier version adds to the stark and tragic drama. But most notably, James Mason in the earlier film was an ideal Brutus, a perfect portrait of a good and noble man misled into making bad choices at every turn. Robards, on the other hand, plods through this version, struggling with the rhythms of the language. His portrayal is so bland that it is completely unbelievable that anyone would want him as a leader of such a great and deadly conspiracy.",1019606400,2,1485,4.8046875
224385,4,6300208575,"I enjoyed the overall performance. An interesting site note: the cover says Charlton Heston plays Caesar; he actually plays Mark Antony.
I noticed the editorial review that mentioned Jason Robards' ""zombielike performance"" and a customer review that said his acting was ""lousy."" Robards was actually a highly talented actor, but I also thought he seemed a bit out of place here. I suspect that, while he was perfect for ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" and, I think, ""The Day After,"" he never trained for Shakespearean acting. It takes a form of voice training that is specifically designed for Shakespeare's plays. Thus, putting Robards in ""Julius Caesar"" was a bit like putting a star football player in a basketball game, or vice versa.
I got the same impression from Michael Keaton's portrayal of Constable Dogberry in ""Much Ado About Nothing."" Keaton is a talented comedian (e.g. ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Gung Ho"") but he seemed almost flat and mechanical as Dogberry. The portrayal of the comic relief characters (e.g. the cobbler in ""Julius Caesar"") also is highly specialized; the actor must come across as an exaggerated stereotype of a coarse, crude, and low-class person (the same class to whom these lines were meant to appeal, i.e. the ""groundlings"").
Sir John Gielgud was, of course, a famous Shakespearean performer. According to a Google search, Charlton Heston also had Shakespearean training. Dame Diana Rigg, who is better known for her role as Avenger Emma Peel than as Portia, also began her career in Shakespeare. She made an excellently villainous Regan in ""King Lear"" as well.",1011657600,2,1592,5.1505791505791505

7804887,5,6300208575,"What do Moses, Ben-Hur, and Antony have in common? Answer: They all look like Charlton Heston.

If somehow you missed the play or the history, basically Julius Caesar let his status go to his head and is about to take on the role of emperor. It is up to a handful of Noble Romans to see that this does not happen. The play is about these individuals, their individual purposes and what happens to them after the attempt to stop him. The focus is on Caesar's right arm (Mark Antony).

This is a 1970 rendition of Shakespeare's play ""Julius Caesar"" that is well adapted for the screen. Hence the characters are well known contemporaries. You will notice the major players and might miss some of the others such as Preston Lockwood (Trebonius) who played the Judge in ""Strong Poison"". With many movies the actor out shine the character and totally changes the emphasis of the story. However this version is well done with maybe the exception of Jason Robards (Brutus) who sometimes seems like Jason Robards playing Brutus at other times he is quite exceptional. Diana Rigg (Portia) who looks like a little girl is the only person that sounds like she is speaking in meter. Everyone speaks clearly and pauses long enough for you to think before moving on. Facial expressions are important to the story and they do not look like they are yelling at you (except in speeches).

You will notice that the background music is also of 70's vantage and is used to emphasize certain scenes. However the volume is not so high that you can not hear the clear pronunciation of the lines. Also the costumes made with satin are distracting. At one point Antony looks like Carol Burnett when she was wearing a curtain and left the rod in.

As the play proceeds you will be so wrapped up in it that you will not care about the little differences in form and be totally absorbed in the film. There may be better versions and/or more favorite versions but that doe not make this version any less worth having.",1496016000,,1987,4.588732394366197

7804890,3,6300208575,"Released in 1970 and based on William Shakespeares play, Julius Caesar chronicles the last days of Julius Caesar (John Gielgud) in mid-March, 44 BC. Richard Johnson plays Cassius, the leader of a group of high-ranking Romans who seek to assassinate Julius while Jason Robards appears as reluctant accomplice, Brutus. Charlton Heston plays Mark Antony, a sympathizer of Caesar who condemns the murder.  Jill Bennett and Diana Rigg are on hand as Calpurnia and Portia respectively. Richard Chamberlain plays Octavius, Caesars nephew.

Whether or not youll like this film depends on if you favor The Bard and iambic pentameter. If so, youll probably love it; if not, youll find it dreadfully dull. Those in the middle, like me, will certainly find things to appreciate, but will generally be bored by the proceedings. Heston is captivating as Antony, particularly in his extended funeral speech to the citizens. Hes pretty much as effective as Brando in the 1953 film in his own unique way. Unfortunately, Robarbs is the definition of wooden during the first half, but hes quite effective in the second. Hes a fine actor; hes just not the best fit for Shakespeare.

This is basically the same movie as the 1953 version, albeit with different actors. I prefer it because its in color and is more modern with superior action sequences, like Caesars brutal assassination and the climatic battle. Its interesting comparing the two movies because each have their strong and weak points.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in MGM British Studios & Pinewood Studios, England, and Spain (battle sequences). It was directed by Stuart Burge.
