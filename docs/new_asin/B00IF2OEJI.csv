So hes getting a sweater for Xmas instead.",1513296000,,91,4.411764705882353
6262461,5,B00IF2OEJI,"Great series, but remember this product is not for U.S. DVD players. You can use it on your computer but you need to reset it for playing European DVDs and you can only reset 5 times, so better to have a separate computer that you can leave on this setting.",1475366400,2,257,4.16
6262462,1,B00IF2OEJI,"I loved the series 1 and 2, then series 3 went back to the first. You really bought into these people and it was like a joke on you. You felt like a fool.
They only needed the 1st series and the last story of series 3. Only thing different is Billy is dying. Some faces changed but they are all the same. I feel like Martha, it was a complete waste of time and money. I just hated everyone to different degrees.
It I see any series with Maxine Peake or Peter Moffet name on it I will never watch it. Once fooled shame on , twice fooled shame on me. Never more!",1454284800,2,560,3.9210526315789473

8641740,5,B00IF2OEJI,"This show is about a group of barristers trying cases on both sides of the law--representing criminals and representing the Crown. The stories follow the cases and the relationships between the barristers and the people they work with. It's beautifully written, directed and filmed, with complex characters. You might enjoy this if you liked The Good Wife. Maxine Peake gives a stellar performance in the lead role, but the entire cast is strong. I also have to give a shout-out to Neil Stuke, who plays ""Billy."" Binged all the seasons and wished there were more. Perhaps that's all they wanted to do. They did tie off the ending, after a fashion.",1532217600,,647,4.837837837837838
8641741,5,B00IF2OEJI,I love this series!  Wish there were more seasons to binge on.  British telly is the best...,1531958400,,92,4.352941176470588
8641742,3,B00IF2OEJI,"Watching this on Prime. Into Season 2. I generally agree with the UK reviews Ive seen. In other words, mixed. Characters are good, scripts have a lot of room for improvement. The worst thing is the apparent absence of captions, which I think are absolutely necessary for these British series with fast paced dialogue.",1531699200,,317,4.888888888888889
8641743,5,B00IF2OEJI,"Maxine Peake is tremendous in the lead role.
A must for any fan of courtroom dramas.
Very well done.",1530662400,,100,4.315789473684211
8641744,4,B00IF2OEJI,"I loved all the relationships and chamber politics, but occasionally I thought the arguments in court were not enough about forensics (which I like) and more about Martha's humanity (which was OK too). I would watch another season, just to see what Martha decides to do and how the chamber develops; and I HOPE they get rid of Harriett, the most annoying politician in the bunch. Also I detested and felt sorry for the alcoholic barrister who annoyed me mot of all.",1529625600,,465,4.682926829268292

8641747,5,B00IF2OEJI,I have been waiting FOREVER for this series to be added to prime.... I literally screamed when I saw it... YESSSSSSS,1527811200,,116,4.571428571428571
8641748,5,B00IF2OEJI,It is like a British LA Law.  Great series!,1527206400,2,43,3.7777777777777777
8641749,4,B00IF2OEJI,"Tough, brilliantly paced and edgy chambers and court stuff with a great cast and smooth direction.  Some of the most memorable characters in English courtroom drama.  A bit anti-polis throughout, as befits an essentially defending lot of barristers.  This is more grown up than Mortimer's Rumpole, and worth your time.  All three seasons are good: the third a bit less predictable in plotting.",1526947200,2,393,5.190476190476191
