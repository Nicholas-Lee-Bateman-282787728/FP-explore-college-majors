8525276,1,B00857XASE,"I watch the 3D English/German version with the 3D glasses on. To be honest, there is really no difference between the 2D or 3D version. The story is a very simple and stupid one. A nelly gay vampire, who is supposed to be the re-incarnation of a King Vampire, kills all the people that have
humiliated him before. The one star I gave this movie is for the audio and sound, which are quite professional done.",1518307200,,407,4.368421052631579
8525277,5,B00857XASE,"BLUE RAY version is GERMAN language only---please note that BEFORE buying----I got the plain DVD (USA) version and it is now one of my FAVE movies - funny as h-e-double hickey sticks and while some say they did not care for the acting, I personally felt they did a great job and nailed their respective characters - everyone.  If you like Rocky Horror Picture Show there should be no problem liking this, only this I felt was better acted, much less campy and while the Carmen charater is clearly gay they don't turn him into a over-estrogened drag queen type like some films do and fall flat for it.  Carmen... as are all the characters....is one you'll side with and enjoy.",1431043200,,675,4.570247933884297
8525278,4,B00857XASE,I loved it. This movie is campy and clever. If you loved Shawn of the Dead or Zombieland you will love and laugh at Vamperifica.,1375488000,,128,4.16
8525279,2,B00857XASE,"There is absolutely nothing in this movie that needs to be in 3-D. This is another case of jacking up the price on a movie by slapping 3-D on the cover. I don't think this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but the acting was really bad. Maybe if the writers had given the actors something better to work with.... There isn't enough camp to make this campy, not enough horror to make this a horror film, and nothing funny to make this a comedy. I'm sorry that I have to give it such a crappy review because my daughter is in it, and I wish it had been better.",1342396800,6,559,4.045045045045045
