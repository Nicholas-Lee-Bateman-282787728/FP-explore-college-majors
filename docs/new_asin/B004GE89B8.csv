4372864,5,B004GE89B8,"I have watched this movie a long time ago when it was playing on TV. I was curious to see why some people rated the movie as bad. The common complaint was that they had bought it thinking it would play on most DVD players in the US. So the issue should be with the people selling you the movie for lacking to notify you about Region 1 versus Region 2 product, not with the actual movie. Please don't confuse the 2.",1379721600,6,414,4.060975609756097

4372867,5,B004GE89B8,"This is a great movie. So wish they would make it for viewing on US DVD players. I have not personally seen this 2 DVD set because I don't have the equipment to watch it on. Instead, I continue to watch it on VHS recorded from my TV many moons ago. Stephanie Powers plays a double role as twins who switch places and there is never a dull moment.",1348358400,6,346,4.028985507246377
4372868,1,B004GE89B8,This reminds me of eBay.  Vendors putting foreign product up as English.  Bad experience - probably won't use Amazon for any further purchases of movies - painful.,1327276800,7,163,5.0
4372869,5,B004GE89B8,"I saw this movie many years ago when it was on tv. Starring Stefani Powers playing a duel roll as twin sisters dying to be the other sister and trading their lives. Only it backfires, and one sister dies while using the other sister's roll, leaving the unmarried sister living with her brother-in-law and niece and nephew, only they think she is their wife and mother. Very good plot and it continues to thicken until the end! I won't spoil anymore, but this is a great movie with twists and turns. I just wish they would make it Region 1, so we could buy it here in the U.S.",1325894400,35,575,4.284403669724771
