7420262,5,B014NSVKDU,"Such a great way to learn the ABC's. Although my 2 year old is still focusing on basic words, this DVD is a great tool to start teaching each letter and whole words for each. She was 100% interested and really focused on what was being taught.",1452729600,,243,4.191489361702128
7420263,5,B014NSVKDU,This is a great learning dvd! My son is 4 and loves it. We have volume 1 as well. He always follows along with the dvd and does the puzzles and questions. I would highly recommend these dvds for kids ages 3 and older.,1451520000,,217,3.9545454545454546
7420264,5,B014NSVKDU,"This DVD series is very helpful with teaching kids how to listen to the sounds to identify which letter is missing in each word. It helps with a little bit of spelling and even touches on directional words with a compass (north, south, east and west). My daughter really pays attention when watching this DVD. The songs are catchy, too.

I received a free copy of this DVD in exchange for my honest opinion about it.",1451520000,,416,4.473684210526316

8731466,5,B014NSVKDU,Great for the little guys.  Mine are 2.5 and 4 years old and they're wearing out these discs.  Just wish I could have gotten a whole set instead of just one chunk of the alphabet at a time.,1488153600,,189,3.9473684210526314
8731467,5,B014NSVKDU,My toddler loves ABC Monsters. I streamed on Hulu but the rights expired and I was desperately trying to find on DVD. I don't understand why only 4 DVDs have been released stopping at letter P.,1481241600,,193,4.388888888888889

8731470,5,B014NSVKDU,My 4 year old insisted he didn't want to watch the DVD. Based on its cover haha he's big into fire trucks and assumes if it doesn't involve one its not good. After it started rolling he was very involved & very hooked.,1474156800,,218,4.093023255813954
8731471,5,B014NSVKDU,"What would the world be like without the letters M N O P? Chaos! We use these letters every day and, in this DVD, preschoolers and kindergarteners help solve a mystery to find a different missing letter in every episode. This is a fun filled show containing four episodes, each one about the relationships of letters and how important they all are. Each episode focuses on a specific letter and uses words from that letter throughout the show.

This animated cartoon adventure has the perfect blend of silliness, singing, puzzles, mysteries, exercise and games. I enjoyed the colorful animation and all the different activities that keep your mind entertained. The letters are all adorable. It teaches children how to spell, write, count, directions, phonics and the importance of letting peers know where you are.

My favorite episode to watch is Odd Jobs and Octopuses. I love this episode because it is silly. I like all the fun words that we learn and it is really cute. I love the way that it incorporates many different ways we use the letter O. The letter O is very quirky.  The way he solves the problems with all his odd jobs is original. All the letters get together to help O. This episode also teaches teamwork and that is a very important lesson for children to learn.

The voiceovers are quite believable and easy to listen to.  The voices vary enough to make it easy to see differentiate between the letters. All the character are adorable and make you want to play along with them, sing the catchy songs, exercise, dance and do the fun games.

My favorite character is Alice because she is so adorable, sweet and helpful. I love the ways she supports her friends Brian and Cherry Berry while they try to find the missing letters. Brian is very funny and just too cute for words. I love how he assists Alice and Cherry Berry by telling them what words mean. Cherry Berry is a magical fairy with a jester stick that is friends with Alice and Brian. She is very helpful and is willing to help Alice and Brian find the missing alphabet letters.

The graphics are bright, silly and colorful. The directors, Au Loong and Cheong Siew Wai have created a fast paced, entertaining show that captures your attention from beginning to end. You are sad to see it end.

I recommend this show for ages 3 to 7. Older kids will likely enjoy watching it too as it reminded me of being younger and reinforced that learning can be fun. Cute, singing Monsters always make people smile. This really is one cute, adorable, quirky and fun learning experience all rolled up into one DVD of four episodes. I give this DVD 4  out of 5 ABC Stars.
