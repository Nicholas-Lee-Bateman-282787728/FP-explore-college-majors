6667438,1,B00NLZAC5O,"Well, folks, I've FINALLY found it--the WORST MOVIE EVER.  This little stinker tries to tell the story of when the Middle East's tectonic plates shift and those people on camels find themselves fighting for survival in a snow storm.  Oh brother, this one is BAD and I don't mean bad as is a ""good bad,"" I mean bad as in just plain awful.  Even the bad CGI could not save this mess that doesn't make one iota of sense, is about as horribly acted as you can imagine, and has ""Into the Storm"" beaten for the worst plausible picture ever made.  For instance, at the airport (where people are trying to evacuate), if you pay any attention at all, you'll find the same shot of the same people trying to run from the storm.  Please pay careful attention to the woman in purple; five different ""shots,"" same woman in purple covering the same amount of ground.  Oh, and that's not the only time that maneuver is used!  You have people caught in a terrible blizzard, yet nary snowflake ever shows up on their heads or clothing.  I mean, this one is just brutally awful.

You have to give the ""B"" movies a break once in a while because you usually don't expect much.  But I expected SOMETHING from this.  This mess doesn't even come close to the worst SyFy movies.  I guess not all is a total loss because I'm willing to bet this becomes another ""classic"" because it's so bad.  The acting you have to see to believe; I cannot do it justice by trying to describe it.

This movie was was rated, oh hell, I don't care what it was rated.  Just don't waste your money like I did.  It will be on SyFy soon enough.  Awful, awful, awful.  Oh, and did I mention it was awful?",1418256000,57,1655,4.300970873786408

6667449,3,B00NLZAC5O,"Goofy movie but I watched it through. Special effects weren't so special. The film started off somewhat interestingly with disaster happening on aircraft carriers trying to go about their business when somehow there is magma which will cause freezing conditions in the desert. HUH? Okay, I'm game. Sadly, the film fell at the point we meet The Family. What a poor ensemble cast! The annoying Son Who Cannot Stay Out Of Trouble. The Know-All, Tell-All Daughter Who Will Become Seriously Injured BUT forget which arm is injured by the end of the movie. The Lovely Screeching Wife with her Bozo Husband Who Cannot Speak Below A Shout. The family never gelled into a cohesive, believeable unit. Have to say, I did like Tariq, the Mysterious Handsome Man With A Secret.
One thing I don't think was ever explained (or else I missed it) Dad carried a snow globe throughout the film and kept looking at it like it was trying to tell him something and he wasn't getting the message. I kept waiting for the aha moment but never saw it. Was that one of the moments I fast-forwarded through or did it never happen?
I think it could have been halfway decent with a more cohesive cast, maybe not. As others have mentioned there were glaring mistakes made with repeated scenes and objects that simply didn't belong.",1489622400,,1300,4.706140350877193

6667459,1,B00NLZAC5O,"I love campy B-movies, and find special pleasure in many of The Asylum's most ridiculous productions. That affection does not include ""Age of Ice"", which is definitely in the running for The Asylum's worst movie of all time. Watching it is a relentlessly grueling experience; I found it utterly stupid, awful in every way, and overtly wanted all the characters to die as quickly as possible. Even in that hope I was disappointed.

The film opens with some kind of military exercise in the Arabian Sea, during which an utterly bogus CGI F-18 crashes and the aircraft carrier ""USS Reagan"" sinks for environmentally calamitous reasons. It's ugly to watch, is less realistic by far than the horrible ""Bermuda Tentacles"" giant alien squid from outer space eating Air Force One in the Bermuda Triangle movie, and never misses a chance to annoy and bore the audience. After that opening, we never see the military again until the arbitrary ending minute or two of the movie which wraps up approximately nothing.

The film then jumps to a tremendously annoying, entitled American family on vacation in Egypt touring the pyramids. The two kids, particularly the son, are bratty and annoying, but the worst is the mother. This is the primary reason the film doesn't work: forget the garbage science, the terrible effects, and all the melodrama, the fundamental problem here is that director Emile Edwin Smith has created a cast of protagonists that aren't just unlikeable, they're detestable. Anyway, while touring the pyramids, Dylan, the son, keeps playing a stupid video game on his phone. Why are they showing that? Well obviously because that's a skill that's going to save the day later on. (Duh!) There's lots of talk about how hot Egypt is (this is treated as news), when suddenly there are a load of terrible digital effects that tells us the plot is starting. It's explained that the entire Arabian peninsula has shifted at a fault line and released a huge fissure of volcanic magma, which is going to make the Earth freeze. What? Huh? It starts snowing in Cairo, so the intrepid family head by cab to the airport. Annoying mom scolds the cab driver to talk more softly on the cellphone because it's ""scaring the children"". I was hoping he'd stuff a sock in her mouth, but no, he just abandons them right outside the Cairo airport. You might be surprised to see a US Airways A-320 and a bunch of American Eagle Regional Jets at the gate on a sunny afternoon at the Cairo airport during the worst blizzard in human history, but just go with it. There is a lot of repetitious filmmaking on display as well as the worst digital snow imaginable. Continuity is nonexistent.

Because a plane crashes on takeoff they go across the street to take a train...to where, exactly? Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter. The kids fall off the back of the train and after long consideration and much screaming the parents jump to join them. Along the way they pick up a young connected Jordanian who makes a call and gets a C-130 dispatched to pick them up from the middle of the glacier. Right. So they fly a while and then have to land because of...some vague kind of freezing emergency. The plane sinks into the ice and they all have to trek to safety. They decide that the safest way to walk is directly into the storm. Before you know it there are camel rides all around, an exciting pickup truck and winch scene, a broken arm, an exceptionally improbable romance subplot, and the scene you've been waiting for since the opening when Dylan figures a way out of an ice cave using his mad video gaming skills, a scene that may provoke vomiting when it closes with the line ""Your son is brilliant!"" Oh, please. The trek goes on, there's a last minute pseudo tie-in with the opening military exercise, and the film just ends.

Even by the standards of Asylum films, ""Age of Ice"" is an unmitigated disaster. Starring no one, it features some of the worst acting I have ever seen, it has laughable continuity, is completely nonsensical, and makes the audience actively wish for the demise of the protagonists. I absolutely despised this movie.",1485820800,11,4123,4.730180806675939

If you don't know about the movie studio ""Asylum"", they're known for making really bad rip offs (""mockbusters"") of Hollywood films, often with DVD covers and names mimicking the film ripped off. They started this after the original idea of making low budget horror flicks couldn't get off the ground, and have apparently never lost money on the ""rip off business"". Some Asylum titles (see if you can guess the Hollywood blockbusters) are Transmorphers, Snakes on a Train, The Day the Earth Stopped, Sunday School Musical, Paranormal Entity and Battle for Los Angeles.  The movies themselves are hilariously bad in oh so many ways, and even funnier if watched in conjunction with the blockbusters they mock.

The CGI though...

I think the wife was about the most useless character in the show, she was completely clueless and I found myself cheering for her death several times and sadly I was let down.

Hint to the filmmakers - your audience has to at least 'like' one or two of the characters, & care what happens to them. The lead characters were just terrible.

There is nothing to the plot other than some passing tidbits of information that are used to set up a couple of hours of people having to try to get to an evacuation zone before sundown. The movie is supposed to be set in Egypt where a tectonic shift has caused lava to boil seawater which causes clouds which will cause a deep freeze. The hapless family picks up a local tourist who ends up being the son of the Jordanian defense minister and together they try to get to the coast. This is all fine and good but the movie was filmed in Michigan so all of the background scenes, buildings and cars look like Detroit rather than Cairo. That might be forgivable but the acting is horrific and there's really no plot other than a number of ""escape"" scenes with bad special effects. Some of the cuts between Michigan fields and ditches and special effects are so ridiculous that it's almost a joke. There are really no redeeming qualities to this movie and it is incredibly difficult to sit through. Even as a sci-fi disaster movie, there is nothing to grab your imagination. I can't think of even one reason to recommend this movie. I was more interested in the ending credits than the movie, mostly because it was interesting to see how many people were involved in this movie that obviously had an incredibly small budget.",1434931200,4,1446,4.501901140684411

There is still twenty minutes left but I just had to stop and come here and write a review as I simply can't stop shaking my head. The stupid things these people do - just keep shaking my head. It really is a bad movie like so many have said but it also is exciting if you have a strong ability to overlook all the stuff that makes keep shaking your head. I am watching it on Netflix.

I give these type of films tremendous leeway as far as the acting, special effects and the science behind the movie. I want something a little exciting, campy and acted at the level of a made for tv movie.  For me to rate this movie one star means it was actually about -3 for the normal person. The acting may have been the worst I have ever seen, you will care less if the main characters make it, in fact you may be wishing for the opposite because they are so passionless and deadpan.

6667636,1,B00NLZAC5O,"I am a fan of Asylum bad films, however this one didn't pass the smell test. Due to plates shifting magma causes heating and steam creating pockets where there is ice and snow. As typical in an Asylum disaster film, it concentrates on one family in their struggle to survive in the heart of Egypt (see DVD cover). The family was a bit annoying. Dad (Barton Bund) was anal. The daughter (Bailey Spry) kept making eyes at the Jordanian (Owais Ahmed). Young son Dylan (Joe Cipriano) was a real pain and they would have been better off leaving him behind when he fell off the train. The truck overturn scene did bring a laugh as did the CG drum oil scene.

The big joke of the film was that the US was conducting games with the Jordanian Navy which in reality consists of 27 patrol boats in this nearly landlocked country.

Asylum has made more enjoyable ""bad"" films. My advice is to watch ""100 Degrees Below Zero"" instead. It too is a stinker, but one that is more enjoyable.

Another Asylum production, this one unfortunately near the bottom of the pile. As so often seems to happen with Asylum films, the more special effects required, the worse they are. In this case the film is loaded with ultra-cheap and abominably bad digital effects. This is teamed with cheap sets, horrible costumes and a lazy script. The story is another Asylum standard - simply a group of people running from one place to the next to find safety. What really makes this a problem is the characters which are entirely forgettable and unlikeable. The father, Jack, is constantly angry and barks orders at everyone. His wife seems to be there because there needs to be a wife for Jack. Their two children fade away as they really have nothing to do but tag after Jack.

There is really very little to like in this film. It does nothing new and the things it does, it does them badly. Avoid.",1505520000,,1168,4.692682926829268
