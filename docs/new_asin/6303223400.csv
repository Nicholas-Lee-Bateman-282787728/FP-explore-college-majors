609067,2,6303223400,My wife thought it was going to be one of Gin Millers other Reebok Step workout that she has on VHS.  This one is not as good as the original one.,1439164800,,146,3.7096774193548385

609070,1,6303223400,"The video quality was horrible and the music and musicians were so terrible, I couldn't finish the video. I purchased this thinking it was another Step Reebok video I used to do with Gin Miller. I love step aerobics, but I couldn't get through this.",1413158400,,249,4.555555555555555
609071,5,6303223400,"Had this one before on VHS years ago, so wanted to replace it.  I just love this work out.  It really gets your heart rate up there, and works the muscles as well.  I like the fact that you can really tailor the work out to your fitness level.  You can make it easier or harder, and Gin Miller explains clearly how to make the adjustments.

I do the work out with just the reebok step bench and a few sets of hand weights.  You don't have to have the rubber resistance tube/band.

Picture quality is absolutely fine on my HD TV.  No color problems, as others have mentioned.  It is straight from VHS to DVD, so there are no menu options.  This is not a problem for me, as I do all three exercise cycles, so I just hit play and get working.

Would highly recommend to any veteran steppers out there!!",1400284800,7,799,4.1568627450980395
609072,4,6303223400,I bought this long ago and wanted to replace the vhs tape before my tape player died.  The quality of the dvd is the same and i consider this one of the best workouts for both strength and cardio.,1395446400,3,196,4.0256410256410255
609073,5,6303223400,Love this tape it's the best workout and the music is awesome. It never gets old and I recommend it. Gin miller is the best,1375056000,,123,3.96
609074,3,6303223400,"I had the equipment and decided to try this video. With more use this video should be fine, but for a beginner its a little hard to follow.",1353974400,,139,4.0
609075,5,6303223400,"This is the third copy of this work out I've purchased. Lost one in a move, wore out the VHS copy I used it so much over a 10 year period.

The workout itself is fun and the results are great. The circuit consists of stepping and strength training, in one minute intervals each.

The step workout is easy to follow and has modifications for low and high intensity. Instruction is shown for each variation and the choreography is fun and easy to understand.

The strength training intervals give the option of using a resistance band or dumbells. Instruction is given for each option.

The only issue I have is that I get bored with the music. Once I became thoroughly familiar with the moves, I found I could follow the video and listen to my own choice of music on another device.

All in all, this is a great addition to any work out routine. I highly recommend it.",1264291200,9,867,4.39375
609191,4,6303223400,"I was happy to be able to find this DVD. The sound is slightly off, but it is very usable to work out with.",1256342400,,107,3.5
609192,4,6303223400,"In order to know what to expect, I like to preview my workout tapes before actually performing the workout. I found that to be particularly beneficial in the case of the Circuit Challenge.

As J. Urban mentioned in his review from March 2006, the dvd has been copied directly from VHS is not divided into chapters in a manner that allows the user to skip a workout segment and end up at the beginning of a new segment(such as skipping a warm up).  One must either hold down the fast-forward button, or skip chapters then fast-forward/rewind to get to the desired portion.  In what would be the first chapter, it begins with a short Reebok advertisement (GAH!  Ads on my workout tape!) followed by an intro by Gin Miller saying ""If you are viewing Circuit Challenge for the first time, fast-forward to the end of the workout to review the important information in the pre-workout instructions"".  Okay, so I had to figure out where the end of the workout was in order to locate the important information.  I shall share this little tidbit of with you:  the important information can be found by skipping to Chapter 12 to the end credits.  Then, fast-forward through the credits to ""Pre-Workout Instructions"".  Obviously, this information is best suited at the beginning of a workout.  However, since I chose to preview the dvd and was forewarned by J. Urban's review about the lack of chapters, I was prepared to spend a little time looking for it.

Directly following the opening message and the introduction, it goes right into the workout.

NOTE: The first thing I noticed is the workout studio was lit with red/pink lighting making it appear as though the color was off on my television. I got used to it after a few minutes and it didn't seem so odd.

As for the workout, Gin Miller is an excellent instructor.  She speaks clearly and gives plenty of warning on what move she has planned.  For low-impact options, there is one person in the group (Valerie) demonstrating alternate moves.  Gin also makes sure to call out warnings to let the user know when NOT to follow her on the more difficult moves but to follow Valerie's example instead.

This is a challenging total body workout.  It tones muscles, burns fat, and is a full cardio workout as well.  It combines step, resistance tubes, hand weights, as well as abdominal workouts.  Every ten minutes or so, Gin slows the workout for a moment to do a target heart rate range check.  This is helpful to know when to pick up the pace or to switch to the lower-impact moves.  The workout moves quickly and has a lot of variety so the user will not get bored.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a fast-paced workout that takes care of fat burning, cardio, and toning all on one dvd.

Items needed for this workout: a step platform, hand weights, and an exertube.",1170979200,27,2826,4.606
609193,5,6303223400,I really enjoy this workout. I don't get bored because you change exercises through out. This video combined with a 1200 calorie diet helped me to lose 30 pounds of pregnancy weight.,1158278400,2,182,4.71875
609194,5,6303223400,Wow!!!! I just received it today and it's fantastic. It's been years since I've exercised and I really need to get back in shape. I'm 5'9 and BEFORE I had my baby I weighed 125 lbs and could wear anything I wanted. I now weigh 160 lbs (I recently lost 16 lbs) and my baby's 6 years old! I have tried all the fad diets and nothing has worked. I'm finally ready to get back to the basics...less calories and more exercise! With self discipline and the help of Step Reebok Circuit Challenge..I am positive that I'll reach my goal and rediscover my former self.,1150416000,3,557,4.314285714285714
609195,5,6303223400,"I have almost all of the Reebok series aerobic videos and just love Gin Miller's choreography!  She always has a fun, upbeat and most importantly concise instructions on all her videos. This is one of my favorite that I have been using for over three years.  If you're not sure, buy this one!",1145491200,2,292,4.490566037735849
609196,2,6303223400,"I honestly haven't used this much because I was disappointed to find out it was transferred directly to DVD from VHS without any consideration for the features DVD provides. There are no chapters to select, just place it in the DVD player and hit play.  One is then subjected to having to listen to host advise you to fast-forward to the end to learn the moves and reset your counter to zero to easily find your way back to the tape's current location.  (Note to Reebok, this on DVD, not VHS anymore!)

Not being able to select where to begin your exercise, you'll have to endure the the warm-up portion even if you have your own warm-up routine. I tried skipping it, but the disk jumped to some point in the middle of warm-up. I skipped to the next track, but the main exercise had already started at some earlier point.

Thus, this DVD is too poorly organized (that is, it's not organizaed at all for DVD players) to be flexible.  Because of this, I haven't used it much.",1143331200,41,973,4.41340782122905
609197,4,6303223400,"I had been working out at a gym for about 1 year and decided to start working out at home.  I bought a tape and used it for about a year and needed a new one.  I bought Gin Miller's tape and at first was uncomfortable with the camera work. And really, who needs to watch the musicians when you want to watch the foot work of the people you're trying to follow!  There are plenty of repeat steps to help you catch on if your a beginner, but they can become boring if you're advanced.  I've had to crank it up to keep my interest.
I noticed that her counting is off in one spot, some moves she has you do a set of 4, sometimes a set of 5 and sometimes a set of 6.  I am of the mind set that a set of 4 is the normal.  So it was a little odd at first, but you get over it.
There is no time allowed to get that drink of water.  So keep your bottle near by and sneak it in when you can.
I've used this tape for 2 years now.  I have been bored with it from time to time, but seem to come back to it. I always work up a sweat with this tape, even 2 years later.  I have introduced ankle weights and use both lifts on my step.
I'd suggest before using this video, to have some experience under your belt by going to a gym to learn the basics.  3 visits on a consistant basis would do the trick.
Overall, I'd say this is a great video because it does incorporate cardio and toning.  There doesn't seem to be anything like it on the market.  After the cool off segment I do my own floor exercises to finish it off.  Doing this 3 days a week has helped me lose weight and maintain the weight loss for 2 years!",1075507200,5,1598,3.806060606060606
609198,4,6303223400,"This is my first Gin Miller video and I must say I was really challenged!  I just love her enthusiasm! I haven't worked out in a while and it definitely ""pumped me up.""  It is for all levels (believe me, just starting out again, I'm definitely a beginner), but it challenged me to work up to the intermediate and advanced level.  I also recommend you use weights instead of tubing if for no other reason, to keep up.  The fast pace makes it a little difficult to alternate between the strength training and cardio without having to pause the tape (and I hate to do that).  I nearly killed myself the first time I did it! But if you are looking to build muscle from strength training and burn calories from cardio all in one, this is no doubt the workout for you!",1045526400,2,762,4.300699300699301
609199,5,6303223400,"If you're bored with your workouts and/or want to get maximum benefit from your time this workout is for you. It consists of three 10 minute blocks of circuit training. The blocks fly by very fast because you switch frequently between cardio and strength. No way you'll get bored! Your heart rate may slow a bit on the strength section, but if you put more effort into the cardio section it is like doing windsprints, which can greatly improve your cardiovascular fitness. You will see results with this video. You can do all three circuits, or just one or two.
The video shows most of the people using an exercise band for the strength sections. I use free weights and they work fine for me. You really need a variety of sizes of weights--I use 8 and ten pound dumbells.
Gin Miller is a great instructor. She is intelligent and has a good sense of humor. She has great muscular legs! Her cuing is good and she never patronizes you.
Don't worry about the reviewers who say they weren't working hard enough. You WILL get a good workout. And if it gets too easy, raise the level of your step platform and add power moves!",1031961600,15,1119,4.463414634146342
609200,5,6303223400,"This is a terrific video. There are enough power moves to challenge skilled steppers and Gin keeps things moving so I'm never bored. I recommend watching it through the first time, but Gin's cues are enough to keep you in step afterward. The ab section at the end is good - working on a slant helps prevent neck strain. Overall, this is my favorite Reebok workout.",1026086400,3,364,4.53030303030303
609291,5,6303223400,"I am a certified fitness instructor (ACE).  I no longer have time to teach or go to the gym regularly, but with Gin Millers' tapes I don't need to worry!  Circuit Challenge is great for overall toning and conditioning and appropriate for all fitness levels.  I have recommended this to several beginners and advanced steppers and they all love it.  It's perfect for days when you can't ""fit it all in"" and need to hit all the major muscle groups and get an aerobic workout.  I prefer hand weights to the tubes because I know exactly what my resistance is, but tubes are good and easy for most people to use.  Work hard on the aerobic segments and you can keep your heart pumping through the muscle toning segments.  I am very fit and have no problem exercising in my zone!  Gin's cueing is flawless, as always, and she gives you options for each fitness level, something few instructors do these days.  Her routines are safe, effective, and fun!",1019347200,10,945,4.544378698224852
609292,3,6303223400,"Don't get me wrong, its a workout but if you are a beginner, there are a few pains in the rear. First, you have to fast forward through the entire workout to get the first timer instructions. Then, you are supposed to watch the chick to the instructors right for first time. Yeah, if they ever show her. They also don't show the feet of the instructor much. For some parts I just kind of went back to a move that I already knew and waited until the next section.",1017878400,,462,4.144444444444445
609293,5,6303223400,"This video is about 50 minutes long including warmup, 3 step segments, ab crunches, and cool down.  It won't seem like it though.  It is over before you know it because the moves change so frequently.  You do a step routine for 1 minute, then switch to a resistance training exercise for 1 minute, then back to another step routine, and so on.  I found no problem keeping up with the fast-paced instructions.  Organization is key.  If you have a tube, keep it under the step like the video shows for easy access.  I use hand weights (I don't own an exercise tube), and I keep a couple sets of different sized weights on a chair near my step.  I either grab them from or drop them back on the chair, skip back to the step and get ready for the next instructions.  Gin Miller does an excellent job describing the moves and gives specific instructions to beginners, intermediates, and advanced steppers.  The video also shows you different options for the workout (i.e. resistance moves using the tube or hand weights for each exercise and step movements for various levels). Miller also lets you know which body part an exercise is concentrating on.  You really get a complete workout with this tape.  I have workout videos that are shorter than this one, but seem to take forever to finish.  They have repetitive moves and I really find myself getting tired.  With this video, I'm moving from one exercise to another so quickly and frequently that I don't have time to get bored or tired.  The next thing I know, I'm at the cool down!  That's what makes this video so fun!  Don't be intimidated if you are a beginner.  Miller gives clear instructions, plus the beginner workout is only 10 minutes!  Give it a shot!",1015113600,12,1713,4.557377049180328
609294,4,6303223400,I have been doing exercises all my life. Now I am more into Yoga and Pilates but I needed a challenge. The very first day I used the video I felt it all over my legs and I loved it. The only flaw that I found was that it is a little bit short.,1001548800,,243,3.5185185185185186

609296,4,6303223400,"This video gives the body a really great workout!!  Sometimes the step moves were a bit confusing, but that doesn't happen often. Rotating between stepping and toning exercises is great because it gives the body a chance to rest from the cardio routines, while giving you a chance to tone your muscles. I didn't use the tubing. Instead, I used hand weights, which I personally like better since you can always change how much weight you use. This video is definitely a great addition to any workout routine!!",991440000,,508,4.7727272727272725
609297,4,6303223400,"Gin Miller is an awesome instructor.  This video is a nice change from step routines because Gin alternates stepping and weight lifting throughout the entire routine (I use the weights; not the bands).  I've read other reviews for this workout that complain it's not a good enough cardiovascular workout.  For me, it is.  I'm about 15 pounds overweight and short; so it really gives me a strong workout and allows me to rest my knees a bit when I've done harder workouts throughout the week.  My only complaint about it is that it's not long enough -- could use another 15 mins of workout.",981676800,6,589,4.625
609298,3,6303223400,I am new to step aerobics and found this video to be very difficult. The camera moves around so fast that it is difficult to see what the people are  doing. I would not recommend this to anyone who is a beginner.,966816000,3,212,4.0476190476190474
7841954,3,6303223400,Just okay... I find it a little bit annoying that they keep switching back and forth every minute between the stepping and the resistance training... not loving it!,1522022400,,164,4.892857142857143
