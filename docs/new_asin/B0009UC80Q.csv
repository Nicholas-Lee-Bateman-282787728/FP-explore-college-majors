2319723,5,B0009UC80Q,"This show is an excellent series that portrays the humanity and civic duties of police officers. I like the fact that this show is respectful to police officers and deals with serious true life events. The genre of this series is drama, not a comedy. Police are not being mocked or ridicule.  This show has a mature tone to it.  Adam 12 is superior to much modern police series; This show is very educational to the audience about lawful procedures. I strongly recommend this show to a viewer that is looking for a mature, respectful show that mirrors the truth of police duty. I am 28 years old, and I enjoy sophisticated classic entertainment. This show has even allowed me to have more empathy for the challenges of police officers. Adam 12 is an under-rated gem that is a legacy for generations to come. :-)",1504051200,,811,4.586206896551724

After the series ended the Central Area Command started using the 1 Adam 12 designation for real, it was used for the top unit in the Division.  I was a LAPD Officer for over twenty six years and the Adam 12 series was very accurate  and some Police Departments use the series as training films.  Karl.",1473465600,,419,4.1875

2319859,5,B0009UC80Q,"I grew up watching Adam 12 and started when I was about 15 years old.  Looking back today, it was a bit corny and the acting was surely a little dry and rigid (Definitely in the style of the Director Jack Webb of Dragnet fame ""Just the facts Mam""). With that being said, it was comforting and entertaining to watch justice being done fairly, and professionally, week after week, while following the daily lives of the lead characters Reed and Malloy on their police adventures.  It set the bar high for how police work should be done and the series was based on true stories.  I'm sure the series inspired a lot of watchers to become Police Officers.  Watching the series now takes me back in time to what seemed to be a much saner world.",1467072000,,738,4.404411764705882

2319864,1,B0009UC80Q,"Please note that my rating is for the technical problems with playback.

Non-existent lip-sync because of Macrovision(tm) processing made this annoying to watch.  Had they used a delay chain in the audio equal to the delay in Macrovsion would've helped.  Also, the sync suppression was too much for my player.  Lots of tearing of the image and playing one episode locked-up my player causing re-setting..  Optically and aurally, the transfer was good.  Pity the digital processing was overdone.  Yes, I know the producers/distributors always say ""use another player"".  That's unacceptable.  I can't blame the owners of the copyright for wanting to protect their content from piracy.  But, when it negatively affects the customer experience, there's something wrong.

As for the content, yes, you'll see a lot of the same stock footage re-used from episode (""Biff's"" must've always been their dive for Code 7) with several themes being re-used between Dragnet and ADAM-12 episodes.  Not to mention some of the support characters from Jack Webb's troupe.  There is some first-rate acting here.  Especially in the episode where Reed shoots a 16-year-old gunman.

I enjoyed the episodes and will likely buy others as this is the only source..",1463788800,2,1238,5.244897959183674

They keep your attention.  This did not.  By contrast, I ordered all seasons of Emergency! and I've gotten most Dragnets.  Loved Mannix, Hawaii-Five 0, and now Blue Bloods.

I contacted Universal and got the first class runaround from them and finally got replacement DVDs that had the same failure issues in new and different spots.
I have been watching the reviews for these long years in hopes that Shout Factory or someone like them would pick up production of the first season, and allow me to enjoy watching the first season, to no avail.

One thing has not changed, Police are still individuals riding around in black and whites making a whole lot of gray decisions. If everything was right and wrong anyone could be a police officer but it's not always so clear cut. I always thought this show did a great job of bringing that out in real life as well. As a kid I thought Pete was a know it all,,,,,as a officer getting close to retirement,,, I realize how we transition through our careers. Excellent product.

2320280,5,B0009UC80Q,Adam-12 was an entertaining police drama that was more procedural in comparison to the edgier cop dramas were used to seeing today.  This was a Jack Webb (Dragnet) production which means the show could almost qualify as a recruiting tool for the L.A. Police Department. A lot of the story ideas were taken from actual police records and that is good because as the old saying goes you cant make this stuff up. The show benefits from the interaction between the two lead characters as they ride from one call to the next in their squad car.  It helps that both actors were friendly off screen as well as on and that chemistry has a lot to do with the longevity of this series.  The show was consistently good for 7 seasons and it even spawned a remake several years later.  Highly recommended.,1402012800,2,792,4.5174825174825175

2320351,4,B0009UC80Q,"DRAGNET creator-star Jack Webb's imprimatur is all over this 1968-69 Season of ADAM-12, a consistently entertaining look at the on-the-job lives of a couple of LAPD patrolmen.

No surprise there: Webb whom portrayed streetwise homicide detective Sgt. Joe Friday on the less successful series DRAGNET co-created and produced ADAM-12 as well (he also directed the pilot episode) and his sensibility--square, old-fashioned, low on frills-- imbues the 26 episodes included in this set of this police drama.

Martin Milner stars as Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy, a veteran cop whose new partner (following the death of his previous partner) is Los Angeles police Officer Jim Reed (Kent McCord), a rookie who's more than a little wet behind the ears and Bill Boyett stars as their superior officer(Sgt. MacDonald).

ADAM-12 ran on NBC for 7 years from the Fall of 1968 to the Spring of 1975 and was also a spin-off of DRAGNET and follows them as they make the rounds in their police black & white, dealing with all manner of circumstances, from the mundane (traffic violations, petty domestic disputes, noise complaints) to the monstrous (murder, drugs, child abuse, suicide).

Each episode is about 25 minutes long, the episodes chronicle the quotidian vicissitudes of these patrolmen, as opposed to the investigators, forensic experts, lawyers, and such who populate today's cop shows.

Whatever the storyline, the tone is fairly tame, with none of the graphic violence common to later cop shows & while the '65 Watts riots had already taken place, Rodney King, the Rampart scandal, and numerous other ugly events were far in the future.

Thus ADAM-12 evinces little or none of the now-vast divide (most of it racially based) that exists between the LAPD and much of the community; on this show, the cops are the good guys, without much nuance, which helps explain its popularity with real police officers.

That's certainly not all bad; ADAM-12's realism (for its time) and lack of pretension are refreshing, and the show is looser and not nearly as humorless as DRAGNET. The packaging is as basic as the show itself--there are no extras whatsoever, with 2 double-sided discs containing all 26 episodes.

ADAM-12 also features gritty stories and a realistic portayal of the conflicted police officers of the LAPD in the late 1960s. The debut season was an instant hit with 26 fast-paced episodes making Reed & Malloy LAPD's finest patrolmen just like their fellow officers, Sgt. Joe Friday(Jack Webb)and his faithful partner Det. Bill Gannon(Harry Morgan)were LAPD's finest investigators.

It's also nice to finally be able to see this Freshmen season of this stellar police drama complete & uncut as well as commercial-free without all those deleted scenes you'd get when ADAM-12 was shown in reruns on Cozi-TV, ME-TV, Antenna-TV, and TV Land.

Now I can add this 1968-1969 Season of ADAM-12 to my collection of DRAGNET, HUNTER, and CHiPS, as well as the rest of my collection of ADAM-12.

By the way, Warner Bros. is finally releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389052800,2,3086,5.07905138339921

This review is of Sept 2013 - and I purchased this set several years ago. Some of the episodes would just freeze up - and jam - refusing to play. The menus are Not user friendly. When I want to watch episode by episode - I have to work back through stages of the menu.
I understand that Kent McCord and Marin Milner are both alive - why No bonus interviews and/or extra audio to go with episodes?
And to be clear - I'm Not talking about ONE DVD set - I purchased this in-store once - and exchanged it - then later bought used on Amazon - and even using a high quality Sony DVD player - these discs don't fully play!! :(
I can only watch like 85% of these shows - they freeze up - and I can't get the endings of the shows or sometimes even the gist.
So with my SETS - there were manufacturing defects. I hope they will or have corrected these problems.

Sometimes it will screw up my DVD player (regardless of which ones i use) so bad I just have to unplug it and let it reboot, because it won't let me complete any function on the remote or console. It just freezes everything. And it happens during two of my favorite episodes, Reed's 1st shooting board hearing, and the girl who gives Pete the Porsche for giving her a ticket. If I could get a decent copy I didn't have troubles with this would easily be five star plus.

2320393,1,B0009UC80Q,"The show is 5 Stars+, a stone cold classic. The US DVD set of season 1 is not.

The bit rate on the  Australian 4 disc [all 8.5GB!] set is also higher averaging around a nice 5.5MBps. The Australian is what the US version should have been.

Please keep in mind that although Australia is NTSC it is also Region 4 so you need will player that is multi-region or region-free.

On this set, the last episode would not play at all and the two previous were very troublesome, starting and stopping the whole way through. So, it looks like this is a problem with the dvd producer.

2320484,1,B0009UC80Q,Season one DVD by UNIVERSAL is horrible quality. Many DVDs produced by Universal are unplayable. In this season one DVD set you may view about half the shows. The rest stop and won't play or have serious glitches..stop and go or freeze up or display ditized pixelated sections that won't play. Sad. I have found this to be true of many universal releases. When I see the universal logo come up on the screen I am just filled with a feeling of dread. The Show is great but the production quality of the DVDs is crap.,1298937600,9,515,4.375

I came here to see if there has been any improvement in current sets. The impression, disappointingly, is no. I am unable to watch episodes 5 -7 on side A of disc one, which is where I am at the moment. Since these are Universal discs and Amazon's product page above still lists that company as the distributer, I guess I'm out of luck for seeing those episodes. I hope I can see some of the remaining ones. This is a crock, Universal. charging $39.99 for a known defective set. Great show, though, which I remember with pleasure all these years later.

UPDATE. I must revisit this review to report that I was able to watch without any problems at all this complete set when I played it in my Panasonic 35 Blu-ray player. Perhaps if you are still having problems, you might have more luck with a newer player that may have a better ability to deal with disc problems.

There's always a 'but', isn't there?

Episode 24 (Log 172) started playing erraticly about halfway through. Episodes 25 and 26 (Logs 92 and 22) wouldn't play at all. They were all on the 'B' side of the second disc, the last three consecutive episodes.

I'm changing the rating to a 5 star now because it's been fixed. I just repurchased the set after it had been temporarily pulled and wante dto pass along that Season One plays just fine now and is safe to buy.

When they were fixing the defect it's too bad they didn't also make this a 4 disk set like the other seasons though. For some reason the Season 1 packaging is still really awkward and clunky with two 2 sided-disks in a real fat cases that are twice the thickness of the other seasons.

But the main point is a great show, the disks play just fine now, and I'm glad to have it.

2320528,4,B0009UC80Q,"You know, some shows just don't age well. This one is not one of them. It ages very nicely, very nicely indeed. OK, there's some hokey 60's stuff here and there (like the time the boys confront a bunch of hippies and are immediately aggressive), but it's not too much, and besides, a little hoke is OK. Some of the acting is wooden, but then again, much of it is pretty good. We lack realism in today's entertainment. It's too much hyperbole.

I have a soft spot for this show, as I grew up on it, and it shows all the neighborhoods and streets of my childhood not as they are today, but as they were when I was a kid. I'm watching the show and alluvasudden waiting for my Mom to pick me up for swimming lessons at the 'Y. Imagine that - watch Adam-12 and go home.

The quibble? Well, The main episode screen in the DVD only gives you a link to 4 out of the seven episodes on each side of each disc. To get to the other three, you must use the go-to-the-specific-title feature of a DVD player on a PC computer. A normal DVD player can't get there, least not that I can see.

It's great to see it again on DVD.  The program itself deserves FIVE STARS without question!  (You might be aware that although cutting edge at the time, and supposedly following LAPD regs to the letter, things would be handled far differently in the last 25 years than what is shown from 1968-1969.)  The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the quality of the discs is BAD.  I have now given up trying to get a set that will play without freezing or stopping altogether.  I see that other people have had a similar problem.  I've watched the 2nd season produced by Shout.  These functioned perfectly.  These discs from Universal have a nice transfer, but you will have trouble finding a set that plays without problems.  Still, I love this old show so much that I will just mix and match various season 1 discs in order to be able to play each episode.  It's not Amazon's fault.  Don't you wish there was some way to complain to the Studio and tell them how they have screwed up?  I sure hear about it in my job if I screw up.  Oh well.

2320536,4,B0009UC80Q,"Adam-12 is one of those rare programs that are so engrossing, that it seems to zip along and be over before you know it.  The action is nearly continuous, with almost no down time.  Created by Jack Webb (Dragnet) and Robert A. Cinader (Emergency), Adam-12 does have some similarities to Dragnet, as the program also follows the adventures of two police officers on duty.  The episodes are also based on actual cases, where the `names were changed to protect the innocent'.

Executive producer Jack Webb's influence is apparent throughout, and although there are many stylistic similarities to Dragnet, Adam-12 wisely avoids some of the clichs found in Dragnet.  Also set in Los Angeles, the series features veteran beat officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner), breaking in new partner and rookie, Jim Reed (Kent McCord).  Two regular guys, with different personalities and personal lives, who are both very likeable, and have good chemistry together.  Malloy is definitely in charge, but Reed is a quick learner, with enthusiasm for the job.  Reed's learning process, also serves as a way to enlighten those viewers who may not be familiar with things like police procedures, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system.  At a time when the image of the police was not the most favorable, Adam-12 holds a pretty steady course, focusing on police work, and mostly avoiding melodrama, moralistic highhandedness, and politics.  The dialog has a style similar to Dragnet, but is less severe, and only occasionally lapses into mechanical woodenness, or dogmatic recitals.

Day and night, Reed and Malloy respond to all types of calls, from traffic violations, robberies, domestic cases, and homicides, to a kid with his head stuck in a fence.  Life is mostly routine, occasionally humorous, and sometimes really scary.  The ability to remain emotionally detached, but still being able to care about people, is part of being a good cop.  Mostly `by the book' (to the point of being a little stiff at times), the officers still display flexibility in dealing with the situations that arise.  While also aimed at showing law enforcement in a good light, unlike Dragnet, Adam-12 is much less preachy, without the emotional moralistic outbursts that Joe Friday (Webb) was prone to, resulting in less contrived drama, and a more enjoyable show.  The writing improves over the course of the season, as the rapport between Malloy and Reed grows, and officers find themselves involved in more interesting cases.

Since many of the episodes concern routine matters, the ones that deal with the officer's personal lives seem to stand out.  In Log 33, Reed is in shock, after shooting and killing a 16-year old sniper, and his emotions erupt when debriefed.  It takes a lot to get Malloy angry, but hot dogging Officer Wells' (Gary Crosby) reckless behavior causes him to blow his cool.  In Log 172, the officers stop a beautiful woman (Anna Capri) for speeding, and she turns into Malloy's personal stalker, doing her best to hook up with him, even giving him a sports car.  Log 92 is devoted to a single case, where the squabbling of two neighbors who share ownership in a boat, bring Adam-12 to the scene three times in one day, on the fourth visit, a man lies dead.

Season One of Adam-12 may be viewed as mundane or pedestrian, by today's standards, as these are not super cops who punch out thugs, bust a drug ring, or engage in a shootout every week.  While the series reflects a certain level of `reality', it is a selective one, where race relations are not an issue, crime is not too violent, and all police are honest, and never abuse their authority, or break the law.  Adam-12 predates the works of author Joseph Wambaug, an ex-LA police officer who also influenced perceptions of the LAPD in the 70's, with his gritty revelations about the men in blue, in books such as The New Centurions and The Blue Knight.  Points of view that Jack Webb, may not have been very interested in presenting.

There are twenty six episodes, on two double sided discs, in this release from Universal Studios.  Picture and sound quality is very good, but there could be some playability issues with some of the discs locking up.  Interestingly, whenever the occasion calls for loud music, the same audio track is used.  Episodes are titled as `Logs', are not arranged in numerical order, and are subtitled.  It would have been great to hear from Martin Milner and Kent McCord, and see what they have to say about the series, some forty years later, but there are no bonus materials.  Hopefully this will happen in a future release.",1249171200,2,4609,4.885604113110539
2320577,5,B0009UC80Q,"The first season of Adam-12 brings the viewer 26 episodes of cop drama based on producer Jack Webb's stern, no-nonsense, cop-is-always-right law-and-order viewpoint.
So if you liked Dragnet, you'll probably love Adam-12, which benefits from not having the stiff-as-a-board Joe Friday asking for ""Just the facts.""
The acting is fair, as are the scripts and production values but the 60's camp value is high.
Have fun spotting old character actors like Ned Glass, future TV personalities like James Sikking and future movie semi-stars like Karen Black.
Enjoy the repeated views of 60's L.A. in stock footage, see the Universal back lot sets shot from dozens of different angles and get a good laugh at the stilted representation of the ""counter-culture"".

2320629,1,B0009UC80Q,"I got this set for Christmas '07 and finished watching the season for the first time ever, but unfortunately just like many other posters here, I too had trouble getting some episodes to play.  All 2 discs, both dual-sided, would start crapping out about halfway into on each side.  The first 3 or 4 episodes would play fine, but when it's got about that many left it starts to go bad.  I'd try several times to play, but to no avail.

Adam-12 Season 1 isn't closed captioned but can be viewed with English subtitles.  Spoken dialogue can be English or Spanish.  I even tried playing a defective episode with speaking Spanish and English subtitles, but no luck.  Once it goes bad, it won't work.

It's a shame my set turned out to be defective; it's the first bad one in my growing DVD collection.  Will exchange it, and will keep on exchanging it until I get all the episodes to play right.  We bought the DVDs to enjoy them, not get frustrated in the process.

Adam-12 truly is a fine show,  I wish Universal would consider starting over so we can enjoy the entire season and not be let down again.  Will check back with an update once I get the entire season to play right, hopefully in the near future.

Update: I went to the store (not Amazon; Adam-12 was purchased elsewhere) to exchange for another copy of it, but they didn't have it in stock and let me exchange it for something else.  Did this several weeks ago but reporting this update so fans hoping to get this set won't be discouraged.  The show itself was great; it's just the discs left something to be desired.

2320635,3,B0009UC80Q,"I hadn't seen this show in probably 25 years or more, so it was great to watch it again. The stories are short and sharp and seeing some of the late '60s L.A. streets is great. The picture colour and packaging are also great but buyer beware regarding disc quality. I bought my Region 1 set many months ago without reading some of the Amazon reviews. I only recently got around to watching the last couple of episodes on disc 1, side A and experienced some serious picture freezing.

I gave the disc a clean and it didn't make a difference. I then played it on the home computer DVD player and it was OK. If you have the right PC software then you may also be able to make a back-up copy of the disc for playback on your regular DVD player. After all this, I then found that the original Universal disc played OK on my regular DVD player. Who knows why? If I have any future problems with other discs in this set, I will downgrade my review to below 3 stars.

So far, this has been the only problem I have experienced with Universal's Region 1 double sided DVDs (I've bought a few but not viewed all of them fully). For Australian viewers, Adam 12 has never had a Region 4 release, so a Region 1 purchase is the only option.

Fortunately, all of Universal's Region 4 TV releases are on single sided discs and they usually include the original Universal MCA-TV closing title. The down side is that many of the one hour programs with a Region 4 release (Columbo, Kojak, Hardy Boys Nancy Drew Mysteries, Magnum P.I., A-Team, Quantum Leap, Northern Exposure, Law & Order franchise, just to name a few) contain episodes that are approximately two minutes shorter than the Region 1 releases and sitcoms such as The Munsters are about one minute shorter. I should add that Universal is not the only major studio that regularly edits its Region 4 releases. Some of the other studios also edit their dramas by up to two minutes per episode and sitcoms by up to one minute. Trying to identify which shows have been edited can be difficult since the approximate running times printed on DVD covers are not always correct.

If you're planning on purchasing some uncut Region 1 releases, do have a careful read of the Amazon reviews to weigh up the pros and cons of having uncut episodes on double sided discs.

Note added December 2008: I've since found that some region 4 releases are shorter not because they have scenes deleted but because they play at a slightly faster speed (something to do with transfer to PAL format) - although you probably won't notice it in the voices or actions.",1195862400,,2579,4.490405117270789

2320679,3,B0009UC80Q,A good show that deserves a better DVD treatment.  A box set compiling several seasons with behind-the-scenes material and cast interviews would be more appropriate.,1191888000,,165,5.6
2320680,5,B0009UC80Q,"This is a great show, and one of my all time favorites.  I was so happy when Universal released it on DVD in'05.  But when is Universal going to release the rest of the series?  C'mon Universal listen to the fans!  Release it on DVD or put it back on TV Land!",1191456000,,259,3.923076923076923
2320681,5,B0009UC80Q,"It's interesting to see what our perception of police, crime, and civility used to be - not that many years ago! This is truly a television classic. I would highly recommend this series to any classic television enthusiast.",1187481600,,223,4.894736842105263
2320682,5,B0009UC80Q,"THIS SHOW IS ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE SHOWS ""EVER"" ON TV.  A GREAT CHARACTER STUDY OF 2 POLICEMAN INTO THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH THE UPS AND DOWNS OF WHAT BEING A COP IS ALL ABOUT.  THE SHOW IS ALSO DONE WITH A CLASS THAT IS NO LONGER SEEN ON TV TODAY!  THE PARTS OF MARTIN MILNER AND KENT MCCORD ARE PLAYED WITH CLASS AND GREAT STYLE.  THIS DOUBLE SET DVD IS A GREAT ADDITION TO ANY DVD LIBRARY.  A GREAT BUY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD!!!",1184112000,,448,4.045454545454546
2320683,4,B0009UC80Q,"I love this show - why can't they make stuff this clean and of this quality nowadays?!  My only complaint is the quality of the DVDs.  When they work, they work great, but some do freeze up at times and there seems to be no way to get past it without restarting the DVD...I do hope Universal will work on the quality issue and then put out the remaining seasons of Adam-12.",1179100800,,373,4.166666666666667
2320684,5,B0009UC80Q,"I love Adam-12.  50 (40 - whatever) years later it is still watchably addictive.  Los Angeles looks so clean.  The LAPD looks so clean.  Cops so honest.  So kind.  So always by the book.  Sandwiched between ""LA Confidential"" and Rodney King there was Adam-12.  Release the rest of the seasons on DVD!  I can hardly wait to see more episodes of my favorite heroes.",1176422400,5,363,4.546875

2320686,5,B0009UC80Q,Being able to watch a great show when we want to. This brought back memories when I watched it with my dad. Now my son and I watch it together. Always had a great storyline and great acting.,1168300800,4,190,4.026315789473684
2320710,5,B0009UC80Q,"I'm soooo happy that they finally put Adam-12 on DVD.  I've always enjoyed watching this show growing up and having to record it late at night on TV Land just to enjoy the simplicity and ""just the fact"" kind of show that was expected from Jack Webb.  As one reviewer stated, its nice to see some of the old locations that I remember growing up in the San Fernando Valley in the early 70's before growth changed the landscape and before Rodney King and Rampart scandel changed LAPD.  You sure can't compare this show with the shows of today that depicts a dark and gritty side.  I'm hoping I can get this for Christmas!!??!!",1165449600,7,623,4.43859649122807
2320711,5,B0009UC80Q,"I really enjoyed watching the ADAM-12 series of TV in the 70's. It seemed to depict the real lives of a pair Los Angeles patrolman. Every episode was taken from the archives of the Los Angeles police files and was very well written, directed and produced. The quality of the show is proven by the interest that is still there for the show in the 21st century. The politeness, courtesy and respect that both Reed and Malloy treated the people that they came into contact with while being called pigs, storm troopers and even much worse is something that shows the true character of a dedicated law enforcement officer- someone that believed ""To Protect and To Serve"" really meant something. They were true law enforcement officers. It is sad that city and town officials of today have reduced many in this once noble profession into the revenue generating ticket writing robots that we see today.",1163808000,2,895,4.780645161290322
2320712,5,B0009UC80Q,"First of all, I haven't had any problems with my discs. They play well on my DVD play with no glitches like i've been reading about.

The show is as good today as it was 38 years ago. Watch a show, any show, that is currently on and you will see this is really better than anything on TV. No filth, just great entertainment about 1968 Los Angeles Police. Shows like ""Friends"" come off as stupid and trashy and not funny. Its no wonder that its rare that a show lasts these days",1159660800,22,477,4.129032258064516
2320713,4,B0009UC80Q,"I had hoped that by waiting, the playability problems reported by other purchasers would have been fixed. Sadly  the set I bought on the 26 May 2006 is suffering freezes and in some case whole episodes not playing.

The strange thing is, that if I repeatedly clean the disk with a cleaning cloth I CAN get the episode to play. For example the first episode I had problems with (5th episode, disk one, side A) originally froze at 13 minutes, but by repeatedly cleaning it I was able to get it to play OK until 15 minutes, then 17 minutes, 21 minutes, then all the way to the ending credits.

It has me totally baffled. Why would repeated cleaning of an apparently undamaged disk  enable it to play through ? AND, why are SOME episodes on the same side playing OK ?

It's a great pity that Universal have not fixed the problems. Because of this, I'll think twice before buying another universal release no matter how much I want to see it rather than suffer the frustration's of not being able to get the disk(s) to play.

My ratings ?  -10 (at least) for the disk quality and 5 stars for the show itself.",1154736000,19,1103,4.351219512195122
2320714,5,B0009UC80Q,"I watched this show as a child and looked forward to each episode with eagerness.  I was happy to find out it was released onto DVD so I could purchase it and share the experience with my daughter.  I was very pleased to see that although out dated (of course!) it didn't come across has hokey.  We enjoyed each episode thoroughly.  We found the episodes a joy to watch and eagerly await the release of another season (we hope!) Unlike other reveiwers,  I experienced no problems whatsoever with the discs.  This is a nice, wholesome show to watch with any member of the family, quite entertaining!",1149984000,6,598,4.59433962264151
2320715,5,B0009UC80Q,"I grew up on this show. It made me want to be a police officer when growing up; of course my parents talked me out of it. There were some rather good performances in these episodes such as the second one which featured Cloris Leachman in a dramatic role as a strung out on acid mother who gave some to her children, and then there was the one where a guy takes a group of people hostage, and at the end of the arrest it sounds like he's mouthing off to Malloy, and he uses the ""F"" word, and then there's the episode where Reed murders a teenage sniper, and they're all here in this dvd series. I can't wait for Season #2 to come out.",1147392000,6,633,4.031746031746032
2320716,4,B0009UC80Q,"When I was a kid, I would watch this show every Thursday night.  It is now strange, and sad, to watch a cop show where officers don't need to wear bulletproof vest as a part of their uniforms.  The show is how I remembered it.  Police work is not always chases and high tension action.  Sometimes it is the traffic stop.  The quality is great and the shows enjoyable.",1147132800,6,367,4.260869565217392
2320717,1,B0009UC80Q,"I loved this show, so I was thrilled when the first season was out on DVD. I rushed out and bought it, and then promptly forgot to watch it. A couple of months later, I finally watched it only to discover that it skipped on disc 2 side one and two.

I was so bummed out. However, by that time, I couldn't find my receipt, so I went out and bought another DVD set and it did the exact same thing in the same spots.

This time I contacted Universal, and sent the 2nd set to them for a replacement. They did send one that works, however, I spent a little over $5 doing this. And I also have another set that doesn't work. I also felt their letter to me was a bit smarmy. They said if I had a problem with the new discs, I needed to contact the makers of my DVD player. In my case, I tried the DVD in 3 different players, and it did the same on all three. I would have much prefered a ""we're so sorry for the problem"" or something along that line. A coupon would have been nice. I'd buy a movie...but I won't drop another nickel on one of their double-sided TV sets.

At this point, after reading all the negative comments about Universal and their double-sided issues, I am not spending any more money on their DVD sets.

I still have an unopened DVD set of Leave it to Beaver, and after reading the comments about those also skipping, it won't surprise me a bit that they also skip. And I bought it a bit ago, so there is not much I can do about it.

When I returned my Adam 12 DVD to Universal, they wanted a copy of the purchase receipt and it had to be dated within 30 days of purchase. I also had to answer a slew of questions about the problem. It seems to me that they would know what the problem is considering how many complaints there have been about this product.

If it was possible, I would give this DVD no stars. I love the show, but the DVD set isn't worth the hassle or dealing with Universal for a replacement. And I just had to eat the $5. You'd think they would have included coupons or something along that line for my time and trouble. They are putting out an inferior product. I won't buy another Universal TV series again.",1146787200,35,2143,4.09047619047619
2320718,5,B0009UC80Q,"I'm 18 now, so I experienced Adam-12, Emergency!, and Dragnet secondhand through reruns on TV Land.  I enjoy these series much more than just about any series that runs on television today, and I was very disappointed when they went off the air.  This DVD set is the best thing I've bought in a long time.

I waited out the technical issues, and I'm happy to report that after making it through both discs, I haven't had any problems with freezing frames or anything else.

I do have two complaints though:

1) The way the discs are labeled makes it confusing as to which side is which.  One side of the disc has two red rings on it, one labeled Side A, and the other says Side B, which makes it seem like one side of the disc is being labeled as *both* side A and B, and it's actually side B, while side A is unlabeled. It's quite confusing.  I wish they had packaged the season as 4 separate discs instead of two double-sided discs.

2) The music is much louder than the voices, which means changing the volume down to make the music quieter, and then up again to hear the voices.

That aside, I'm very happy that Adam-12 and Emergency! have been released on DVD.  These series are a nice break from the drama and violence that plague today's TV shows.  It seems most modern shows and movies spend more time and money trying to wow the audience with special effects and action than developing a good plot or characters.  I'd much rather watch a show like Adam-12 than a show like CSI or Fear Factor.

Adam-12 focuses on showing the lives of the police officers and citizens of LA in a calm and efficient manner.  Martin Milner and Kent McCord were perfectly cast to fill the roles of Malloy and Reed.  I have to say, I love Malloy's attitude and his pointed way of getting to the heart of a matter and making people uncomfortable with the truth. It's also interesting to see how the relationship between Malloy and Reed changes and grows, even throughout the first season.  It doesn't take long for Malloy to go from the seasoned officer angry at training a rookie to an endearing partner.

Adam-12 isn't just for people who watched it when it first ran in the 60's and 70's.  Anyone can enjoy this show, and should take the time to give it a chance.  Don't dismiss it just because it doesn't have all the fancy special effects that CSI has.  This show is worth it for the characters alone.

I sincerely hope that Universal will choose to release the remaining six seasons of this wonderful series.  Until they do, I'll be watching this one over and over again.",1145318400,7,2563,4.4200426439232405
2320719,5,B0009UC80Q,"This is Adam-12 at it's best!  The color is absolutely fantastic!  The episodes are great.  It is my favorite DVD collection.

My only complaint is the menu system.  Whoever designed it was trying to be clever and fell terribly short!  All of the episodes are tagged as ""Log's"".  (Log 73, Log 109, Log 35, etc.)  When searching for a certain episode, it is frustrating.  ""Oh yah, Log 73...That's the one I'm looking for!""

My concern is that Universal is not going to release any of the additional Adam-12 sets.  I think that if a company decides to release a DVD series, they should commit to the entire project up front.  (All or nothing!)

2320761,3,B0009UC80Q,"Universal does it again.  As with other sets from them, they use dual sided DVDs, and the only information about the DVD is that 6 point font around the ring in the center.  Turn up the lights and squint, maybe you can read it.  Most companies use single sided DVDs, with the other side for a full-sized label.  So, Universal gets 30 bucks for content that I used to get for free, never mind that maybe you're customers expect something that's collectable.  So, it's all about corporate profit.  Save a dollar from a million customers, hey, that's a million dollar bonus for the CEO.  So, next time record your favorite shows and burn your own CD's.

2320763,5,B0009UC80Q,This dvd brought back great memories of watching this show as a boy.  This was the highlight of the week.  It also gave me an appreciation for the police departments across the country.  I saw that they were normal people doing a difficult job.  I thought Milner and McCord were well suited for this series and had a great chemistry together.  It was one of my favorite shows growing up!,1139702400,4,387,4.4714285714285715

2320765,4,B0009UC80Q,"I rented this from Netflix... but it wasn't a double sided disc!! Disc One was black with bold ""Adam 12"" printed on the disc. I really want to buy this but was looking to see if the discs have been changed from the doubled sided Universal messes described here by one and all or if this was a special Netflix set-up. I think my question boils down to is: Is this now FOUR one sided discs or 2 two sided discs? Netflix has them as ""Adam-12: Season 1 (4-Disc Series)"" but the store I've seen the box and it says ""Disc One"" and ""Disc Two"" on the two cases. I'm confused.

Update: IF you can BELIEVE this I emailed Netflix sometime back, and they said they get these discs special this way (one sided) to avoid any ""problems"". So, I guess it means it's OK, if the public at large have discs that freeze up...?? Just not big companies, very nice. ((I'm still on the edge about this show b/c of this issue, many here seem to have disc freezes, I myself had problems with Remington Steel S2 and Dragnet S1 with double sided freezing. Not lqqking forward to going through that all over again... it is a mess to try and resolve b/c many places will only let you exhange for the SAME ITEM, but when all the items do it, what good does that do?))

Like the show. The chemistry is nice plus there's far more humor than the rather dull Dragnet set I got as a gift. LOVED the episode when Reed cracked up the car!! He kept pining away about it in the whole episode just like a real person would... and just like I would:))~

Let me know in the next review if the show format has been changed to one sided discs... please!!",1138924800,4,1608,4.197411003236246
2320766,2,B0009UC80Q,"Two weeks ago, I bought ""Adam-12, Season 1"" on DVD produced by Universal Studios.  I bought the set at Best Buy in Asheville, North Carolina.

When I tried to play the DVDs, they would freeze, skip, and some episodes would not play at all.

I went back to Best Buy to exchange it for another set.  This set did the same thing.  In all, I have exchanged the DVDs four times.  Each time, all of the DVDs would be defective as usual.

In addition, I tried playing the DVDs on other DVD players.  I tried it on a total of four players.  It did the same thing on each one of them.  All of these DVD players are only a year old, and one of them was bought at Best Buy.

2320767,4,B0009UC80Q,"From what I've read from others, MCA home video has been having some serious quality control problems with their recent DVD releases.  I've ordered season one of ""Dragnet"" and ""Emergency"" and haven't had any problems playing the discs.  That all came to a halt with my ""Adam-12"" disc set.  While watching an episode on disc one, the program would ""freeze"" at the same spot during the same episode.  I tried this disc in all my dvd players in the house and it happened at the same spot every time.  I returned the set to Amazon for an exchange and received a new disc set.

However, the ""freezing"" problem reared its ugly head again on disc one but in another episode.  Again, the disc was played in all my dvd players (including my computer's) and the disc would freeze at the same spot in the same episode every time.  I returned the exchange to Amazon but am having problems getting this situation resolved.  I would love to have this set in my collection and I sincerely hope that MCA home video will correct this problem and release the following season of these 3 great shows by the late Jack Webb.

ALthough I'm not old enough to have seen Adam-12 when it first came out, I can't forget the reruns played on TV. I was disappointed when TVLand took it off the are several years ago. I heard a rumor it was on again but I kinda don't have access to a TV right now.

Adam-12 is without a doubt the best cop series ever made. I haven't experienced any problems with my DVD except for minor errors which can be overlooked since this is the best TV series ever made. I just wish they had all episodes on DVD.",1132272000,33,581,4.052173913043478
2320769,5,B0009UC80Q,"The chemistry between Kent and Marty was wonderful.  The addition of certain other actors, such as Gary Crosby as Ed Wells and William Boyett as Sgt. MacDonald, just added to the magic that was Adam-12.  The humor was subtle at times, the pathos striking, and sometimes the moral was pounded a little hard, but without a doubt this was, and still is, one of my favorite cop series.  Everyone should be very proud of their time on this series, a look at the real world of the patrol cop.  I hope the entire series is released.

Now, as to the quality of the DVDs from Universal.  I was lucky, I guess.  There was only one small glitch (a freeze just as Pete is giving a ticket to the rich girl who gets a crush on him), but to my mind, there should've been none.  My Emergency! DVD, unlike many, was perfect.  I haven't had a chance to watch the Dragnet 1967 as yet.  There really is no excuse for freezes, glitches or problems.

And, why was there no special bits on this?  Both actors are still alive, both have talked about their time on the series during the years.  And what about a blooper reel?  I know there must be one somewhere?  C'mon, Universal, do it right with Season Two!",1131148800,9,1185,4.322727272727272

However, Universal is notorious for poor manufacturing standards. The other posted review warning about freezes and drop-outs is correct. It happened on my Dragnet set and, now, on this set. The way around it is to test each show (if you can't watch it, then use a timer). Keep exchanging defective sets for good ones. Eventually you will get a good set.

The other poor practice by Universal are the commercials that precede the shows. Makes them look cheap.",1126224000,3,599,4.75

As far as the disc skipping and freezing up - no problems here. I have Kojak, Dragnet, Emergency and Adam 12 and all play great on my Toshiba dvd player.

  Being an old time Adam-12 fan since it was first on, I was excited that it was finally coming out on D.V.D.  I was glad to get my first set.  Too bad it didn't last.  In the third episode of the first disc, it froze up and wouldn't let me watch that episode.  The rest was fine until I got to the last three episodes on disc 2, then it was for all three.  This has happened on the two other sets that I have gotten.  I'm sure that this is a quality control problem.  Hopefully Universal will go to single discs instead of double sided discs for the rest.

Universal should have done a better job ensuring quality - one or two bad sets is understandable, but most of the folks that have bought this have had at least one episode that doesn't play correctly.

Additionally, there is no commentary on the disks, despite both Milner (Ofc. Malloy) and McCord (Ofc. Reed) both being alive, as well as several key people involved in the show also still being alive.

The rating is for the extremely excellent show itself. Universal certainly did not do such a great show justice with the quality and content of this set.

But, (and isn't there always a but?) I am not impressed with the quality of the DVD's of Adam-12. At one point during the very first disk, the stuttering of the DVD was so bad that I ended up turning the thing off. I haven't had the nerve to check the rest of the DVD's to see if it gets worse. I will check them and though I hate to do it...I will take the boxed set back and refuse to purchase another Universal Classic Television item until this issue gets resolved. I own a lot of ""classic TV"" DVD's and this one was by far the worst in quality.

I liked the TV show, Adam-12, but not the product that Universal has obviously thrown out there in order to meet a deadline.

Where is the mention of Adam 12's accuracy to detail, the quality of its stories, its proud Dragnet lineage, its decades of global syndication?

I too loved this show as a kid, I never missed it, on Thursday nights I was always tuned in. And for God's sake, enough of the 20 second introductions, with the the spinning earth and the grand music, every single episode has this introduction, it gets mighty tiring after a while. I also might add, that their quality assurance staff slipped up a little, at least on my set. Disk One was labled ""Emergency Season One"", but after playing both sides of this disk and the other disk, it was indeed, Adam-12. All said and done, I have to say that the episodes themselves, were in very good shape for as old as the original prints must be. I truly hope they release this entire series.

On the other hand, this set gets the usual Universal short shrift treatment: cheap packaging, no booklet, zero special features, dual-sided disks of questionable quality, etc. Contrast this with all the extras on the Resuce Me DVD set after only one season! Look at the great treament that Paramount gave to The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island. Why can't Universal do at least as well?",1124755200,9,718,4.698412698412699

That's one reason I love this show. The other is that this program was actually filmed on the streets of Los Angeles and uses many actual locations at a time when L.A. was still largely suburban and growing. To see the old shopping centers, coffee shops and old green RTD busses going by is a trip to the past. I am looking forward to buying all of these DVD sets, as well as ""Emergency"". My only concern is that they are being released by Universal Home Video, which has a poor reputation for quality. I bought the boxed sets of Abbott and Costello's movies, and 2 of the 3 boxed sets have contain flaws with freezing, skipping and other problems. I own over 400 DVDs and these are some of the few I own with any consistant playing defects.... so I remain cautious on play quality, but I will give the content a five, just the same.",1122249600,73,1078,4.44949494949495

Universal Studios, PLEASE do everyone a big favor and do this DVD set right from the onset!  No consumer wants to see the playability issues that were found on the Dragnet 1967 box set.  It will save a whole lot of expensive postage and gasoline by not having to return the set, (3 times for me), to the vendor!

1-ADAM-12 CLEAR!

Update - 08-10-05

Hey, come on folks.  Universal really did missed the bulls eye on Dragnet.  If Emergency and Adam-12 are nicely restored and arranged sensibly, I'll gladly recant my criticisms.  Until then Universal is coming up way short compared to Image Entertainment  and Paramount TV series distributions.
