4910742,5,B005ZLF2OS,"I have to admit I was waiting for this to be released because I read the book of the same name and it was quite good but the DVD is beyond belief. If you only watch one Movie or Mini Series this year this is the one. The book can be off-putting at first if you're adverse to foul language and sexual references but you just have to remember at the very beginning that it's necessary to this story. It seems to me to be more of a tale of the plight of Women in that period of history (1800's) and it's incredibly moving. The story itself moves at a good pace and I was so engrossed I couldn't stop watching. It seems very realistic of the time period and brings to light some of the atrocities women had to deal with in that Century. It's well known that Prostitutes were very prevalent then and that men could easily put their wives in an insane asylum if they chose to whether the wife was insane or not. However this movie goes deeper, it shows other issues that one might never imagine if they never saw this film. I don't want to spoil it for anyone by telling too much of the plot but I think all women should see this series if only to gain a better understanding of history. It's the BBC so you can be assured it's not going to be too raunchy and all of the scenes that might offend someone are relevant to the story and tastefully done. I watched it with my 72 year old Mother. Sets and costumes are perfect and realistic. Excellent film and very well done.",1348704000,13,1465,4.161971830985915
4910743,5,B005ZLF2OS,"Shockingly real in every detail someone did their homework in producing this amazing piece of film.  You will feel and see and smell London as it really was and take a journey with amazing characters portrayed brilantly by a cast of actors truly dedicated to their performances.  It is graphic so be prepared  - but all is necessary to capture the depth of feelings.

In my area this show started at 10p.m. and ended around  2:00 a.m. on a Sunday night - it is a wonder anyone saw it - too bad because it is great.",1348358400,5,514,4.3125
4910744,5,B005ZLF2OS,"""The Crimson Petal"" is not well known and I found out about it from a friend by accident but never regretted watching it. The beginning takes us to the Victorian London, with its tramps, prostitutes and deseased. It's horrible for the poor but there's not much happiness for the rich either. And having said that, I didn't feel depressed or down after watching it. The series are reminiscent of ""The Libertine"" by the way it's made: very dark, very realistic and beautifully shot and edited. Chris O'Dowd got mixed critique for his performance and I think he did an alright job but another actor would have probably been better. Romola Garai is amazing and so is Amanda Hale.",1348185600,4,675,4.728813559322034

4910746,5,B005ZLF2OS,"I have read the book twice and plan to read it again.  For those of you that did read the book - it follows the novel closely.  I also plan to purchase this movie and watch it again.

It is shocking in nature with the sexual content and the street life of the poor and the prostitutes, but I think it represents what it would have really been like in that time period.  There is no romanticized view to the movie and is not your typical period piece (which I am a huge fan of by the way) so if that is what you expect you might not want to watch it.

I thought the characters were well casted based on the characters in the novel and the scenes and costumes were eerily beautiful.",1348012800,24,680,4.044776119402985
4910747,1,B005ZLF2OS,"Do you ever keep watching a horrible movie with the hope that it will get better?  It usually never does, does it?

For someone who basically loves anything that comes from Britain, especially period pieces, I looked forward to this movie.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the acting and the costumes and scenery, the story was horrible.  I kept thinking, ""Get to the point!""  This was perhaps the unhappiest film I've ever watched in it's entirety.

In fact, there was so much I didn't understand as points were never addressed (why did Sugar have a skin condition or why was she going to avenge the deaths (yet never did?)) This was truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I take the blame for not turning it off after the first 10 minutes.",1348012800,28,1103,5.491124260355029

generally i love period pieces but i just discovered that the book was written in 2002, so obviously it was written with a modern sensibility.

i watched this depressing drama hoping for a somewhat satisfying conclusion and...there was none to be found.

i'm old fashioned in the way that i like to be entertained, and my precious time hasn't been wasted on a nothing story.

frankly, i've seen better film...on teeth.",1347753600,11,608,4.654205607476635
4910749,5,B005ZLF2OS,"Compulsory & addictive, it mimes froth of Victorian London Sts. Cinematography, costumes & sets force viewers deeper into its dark psychological story. The plot and writing are less than stellar. Lead characters portrayals leave one mesmerized by the despicable dearth and poverty of a Dickensian era. Catherine Cookson's poor and low-class tales come to mine too. Don't expect glamor and Victorian gaiety, but every form of crime and dereliction known of the time, 1874. No sympathy, it's lost in strong crass depictions that leave little to imagine. Mad, cunning women are played so well the viewer begins to hate, not adore these characters. Yet it's a mini-series you'll love hating.

The camera's eye, focused on the disgust of the dirty streets and rooms, is filmed so cunningly it resembles Impressionism art done with dark color. Not a love story, but debauchery glistening from mud, vomit, blood and ale. Stunning visuals obligate viewing. Romola Garai (Emma; Amazing Grace) turns sharply from roles like ""Emma."" As Sugar, she's sweet/sour in her portrayal both with and without clothing as she passes from prostitute, to mistress, to governess. Her Mom and Madam (Gillian Anderson- Bleak House) is so convincing she seems to have literally taken a turn into the underworld. Mrs. Fox (Shirley Henderson-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wish-Me-Luck-Series-3/dp/B004WMOSLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wish Me Luck: Series 3</a>) seems unable to decide which side of the orgies she desires. William (Chris O'Dowd) will disgust men and women, with and without garments. Plenty more adding to a coarse, disturbing image of poverty and orgy coming to life. Adults only, strongly recommended.

SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes (an hour each) and bonus material.
1
Step immediately into a violent, crass world of brothels, drink, crime, and Sugar. Introductions of William, a want-to-be writer who mirrors Sugar's own novel attempt. His mad wife pens diaries of illness and abuse. Wm's bro writes sermons. Sugar decides Wm is a rung up the ladder of respect.
2
Wm gets Sugar an apt. She becomes `guardian angel' to another woman, to her gainful advantage. A mistress becomes obsessed. Mrs Fox and Wm's bro have their own bodily fantasies.
3
Sugar becomes a family tutor and more of a wife's madness is exposed via diaries, driving her closer to an asylum. Sugar interferes with unexpected results.
4
Sugar's lap of luxury begins to crumble. Loathing works its way into the lust. The climax of lives gets dirty and dark.

From the book by Michel Faber. BBC drama, not for the faint of heart. The title comes from a line of Tennyson's 1847 poetry, quoted in the series.
If you can't handle earthy, ghastly, sexual crudeness, give it a pass. I'm not sold that the film needed all of it, but it is there. This tames Cookson films and ""Lady Chatterley's Lover.""",1343779200,58,2896,5.250539956803456

4910753,5,B005ZLF2OS,"Just AMAZING.  This series plays out like a top notch classic novel, quite literally (you'll get that by the end of the series).  Romola Garai, who plays the role of Sugar,  exudes sensuality, passion, grace, emotion and pure humanity- she is perfectly cast for the role!  Sugar is a prostitute on the streets of London during the Victorian era- but she is not the normal woman of the night.  She was born with a natural curiosity and intelligence that drove her to educate herself in all areas, but most especially in the literary arts.  It is in this way that she pleases the rich clientele that she so easily attracts. She is born to a prostitute madame who brings her into the 'lifestyle' when she is only 13 years old.  She captures the imagination and obsession of a middle aged wealthy man, William Rackham, who lacks brilliance and ambition. He is clueless in business; his household staff disrespect him and he is so self absorbed that he fails to notice that the family doctor is regularly molesting his wife.  He is so selfish and cowardly that not only does he fail to muster the courage to determine the cause of his wife's unhappiness but it doesn't even occur to him to ask her what is wrong.  He styles himself a writer though he can't manage one page of prose. His father cuts off his income in disgust which leads him to badger his already frail wife.  After she collapses, he runs away into the night, desperate for escape.  Everything changes for him after he meets Sugar.  She has a mind hungry for activity, a heart yearning for love and when he pays to have her all to himself, it presents her a unique opportunity to better herself.  As she begins to understand his perfume and soap business better, she can't help but begin to advise him in it.  This miniseries is about the two people, their relationship and how the two develop, or don't, into the people they imagined themselves to be.  It's a cleverly written story with an unexpected ending.  This series will make you feel.  Though slow in pace, it engages your full attention to the end.  Not for those looking for tons of action or sex.",1509580800,4,2119,4.546174142480211
4910754,5,B005ZLF2OS,"This is a stunning adaptation of a painfully accurate novel by Michael Faber about the ways women's lives were controlled by men in the Victorian Era. I rarely have felt so much empathy for a lead character: Sugar is smart, resourceful, brave, resilient, and loving, making hard choices in a world stacked against her survival and success. (That the adorable Chris O'Dowd, playing against type, managed to keep any level of sympathy for his often wrong, wrong, wrong character of Rackham is really an impressive feat.) The show is beautiful to look at - sets, costumes, hairstyles, sountrack, and photography are all amazing - and well-told, with great actor performances, and even though the situations and glimpses into the filthy London street life can be sickening and gruesome (do listen to the reviews that warn about brutal sex and gory images at times), I imagine the reality at the time was even worse. That's balanced with the lavish interiors, wardrobes, works of literature, and gardens that are the side of Victorian life that appeal so much to the popular imagination; Victorian England was both sides of that coin, which we sometimes forget. It won't make you merry, but you'll be sorry when it's over - sadly, Faber has sworn he won't write a sequel, so one has to make do with just this!",1509321600,3,1304,4.852017937219731

4910756,5,B005ZLF2OS,"Being someone who has actually read the book, I was quite torn on how to feel after 800+ pages of fine print and the ending I received from it, putting it to film was awesome though. May have made me see the book more clearly and grow a new appreciation for the story. Many of the scenes are true to the book, and they left out exactly what was unnecessary. I love the character they had to play Sugar, she really does the best job and they could have picked no one better. I'm glad this ending was wrapped up as it was, for the the book really does drops off in the middle of a sentence and leaves you frustrated. (At least, left me frustrated.)

I feel as if the lower ratings are only low due to not understanding that there are no good and bad and that there are no happy endings in real life and that's what the writer was portraying by making the characters the way they were and taking the actions they took. I didn't see it very well in the book, but I feel a better sense of it now from watching the film.

I'm very happy I watched it.",1504051200,,1044,4.063106796116505

4910762,5,B005ZLF2OS,"All 4 episodes of this series are now available on Acorn TV, which is how I watched it. It's a dark story, told well and in an interesting manner. The subject is very, very dark. The basic premise is that women had no value in Victorian England. There were the finest manners, the finest clothes, a rigid caste system...all were in place. But, for women, there was a strong line dividing the upper and the lower classes. The story starts off in a house of ill repute in England, and the star, a prostitute called Sugar is introduced very fast. Mr. Rickman is completely taken with her and returns over and over again. At first, the hold on him seems to be not only her sexuality but her intelligence. The story moves fast, and it becomes apparent that he is a terrible man. Sugar has high hopes that her life will change with this man. They become completely entangled. He brings her into his life in a completely inappropriate way for Victorian times. It turns out not to be a step up for her, but a step down. Gradually, Sugar becomes degraded by all the little things that happen. This is a very good story. It's worth patiently watching. It's beautifully filmed. The acting is first rate. The ending will surprise you. Now I want to read the book.",1496016000,,1251,4.467248908296943
4910763,5,B005ZLF2OS,"This is an excellent period drama based on the best selling book of the same name. As to whether is it a faithful adaptation, I cannot say, not having read the book. Having seen this mini series, however, I now have every intention of doing so, as I found the storyline to be quite intriguing.

In the stews of Victorian London, lies a particular brothel. Therein, are prostitutes, one of whom is very much in demand and is named Sugar. Elsewhere, in a tonier section of London, lives William Rackam, whose father owns a successful perfume and soap factory. William lives with his high strung wife, Agnes, who is slowly going mad and is under the care of a doctor who should not have any woman in his care. William visits the brothel and engages the services of Sugar, who enthralls him with her sexual bravado and intelligence. Before long, he sets Sugar up in a home of her own, only to eventually move her in with him and Agnes under a pretext. Yes, William is, indeed, vile.

Initially, Sugar has high expectations, but, eventually, as their lives intertwine, she starts getting a whiff of what type of person William really is. Sugar gradually  discovers that she and Agnes have more in common than one would think, except that one is far more resilient than the other. This is definitely a story of unmet expectations and the lot of women in Victorian London.  Their choices, for the most part, seem quite  grim.

Romola Garai gives a beautifully nuanced performance as the resourceful Sugar, while Amanda Hales soars as the histrionic Agnes. Richard E. Grant is perfectly cast as the creepy doctor. Chris O'Dowd does a yeoman's job with the role of William Rackham. The rest of the cast is likewise terrific. There is some limited nudity but not of a gratuitous nature. Those who enjoy period dramas should definitely enjoy this well-made, four part mini-series.",1489190400,9,1869,4.735384615384615

4910794,5,B005ZLF2OS,"There are some excellent reviews of this series and this one is to encourage you to peruse a few to get an idea of what you might see.  To add to what has been written, first know that The Crimson Petal and the White is not subtitled in the streaming version to help you in understanding the various accents of the verbal content.  Nevertheless, from one who always elects to view with the subtitles turned on, it is possible to get the major gist of the dialogue throughout.  Please know also that there is nudity and explicit sexuality.  There are also clear depictions of the physical horrors that befell the poor and desperate in the late 1800's in London.  There is filth and blood and disease, cruelty and depravity, and justifiable madness, but in it all, there is the examination of true and thoughtful kindness as it evolves through the character of Sugar, played by Romola Garai.  She has done a stellar job in this role.

The viewer will also see expert and inspired skills employed by the set designers and dressers and the costumers.  The visuals in this series are superb.

This viewer was spared the conundrum of comparing the book to the film, as I have not read it.  Film and the written word can be difficult to reconcile, but if the viewer can consider the demands of each form, this series can be more than worth your viewing as it is very rich in so many ways.",1475020800,2,1381,4.488

The soundtrack is amazing as well - I saved it to a playlist!

As someone who has made a study of women in the Victorian era, this series is incredibly well researched as to how women were treated socially, economically, and physically, even down to the medical procedures and diagnosis that they had to endure.  This is not a glamorous sugar coated extravaganza of a historic series. Its gritty, callous and depressing while at the same time being very true to the time period with a complicated story line filled with the "" gray area"" of human emotion and actions that is rarely visited in film.",1461369600,4,691,4.663934426229508

4910844,3,B005ZLF2OS,"As someone who adores the novel, I found this series to be disappointing. It follows the plot well, but it isn't exactly faithful to the source material. The main faults were in the casting and the overall tone. Everyone except Sugar is miscast; the worst offenders are Chris O'Dowd, who plays a very one-note William, and Agnes, who has none of the childlike innocence of the original character. The dynamic between many of the characters seems false. The screenwriter misunderstands the central dynamic between Sugar and William, between Agnes and William, and between Henry and Mrs. Fox. They also seriously misunderstand the tone: the book balances comedy and tragedy, but this adaptation casts a sinister light on every interaction, even with a friendly conversation between Caroline and Sugar. The book has optimism, this series only has pessimism. Sugar is a wonderfully complex character, and even with Romola Garai's skills, she can't shine through.
If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy this miniseries, but if you have, you might find it too tonally jarring to watch.",1453766400,,1086,5.141242937853107

4910847,4,B005ZLF2OS,"From my print review

Dutch-born author Michel Faber upended the often overly romanticized view of Victorian England in his 2002 novel The Crimson Petal and The White, a painstakingly-researched 864-page urban saga about a group of Londoners from radically diverse social backgrounds.

It would be impossible for any film to do justice to such a richly textured work. Yet the BBC acquits itself well with its terrific TV adaptation, a 274-minute, four-espisode mini-series that was shown in America this month on Encore and was released this week on DVD by Acorn Media.

Visually sumptuous and gritty, The Crimson Petal and The White stars Romola Garai as Sugar, an uncommonly literate prostitute whose madam, Mrs. Castaway (Gillian Anderson), also happens to be her mother.

Sugar finds a way to climb the social ladder when young industrialist William Rackham (a wonderfully bumbling Chris O'Dowd) falls for her. William's deeply depressed, neurotic wife, Agnes (Amanda Hale), completes the complex triangle at the heart of the story.

Compared to the novel, the TV series is flawed, yet it makes for compelling viewing.",1448064000,,1122,5.280898876404494

The period of time that the story is written is very realistic of the time (nothing flowered over to make the viewer more comfortable.

It is astounding that so much of the story was captured in just four episodes, but it is a very well acted ADULT drama that I would highly recommend.  The story is one of a singularly unique Victorian era prostitute and her journey from the slums of London to the fine homes and society of Knotting Hill and other places unknown.  It is a gritty, dark, sumptuous feast for Anglophiles and those who like dramas with
strong female characters.  No realistic harshness is spared, so sensitive viewers might want to look elsewhere for entertainment, but if one can get through the more graphic or horrific spots, this is a jem of a series!

If you enjoy good movies and series from the BBC, such as Downton Abbey, I suggest this gritty drama. Better than Downton Abbey as far as I'm concerned. This is a truer version of 18th Century England. Downton Abbey shows you the fantasy with everything beautifully arranged. The Crimson Petal and the White shows the raw, cruel, more authentic side to England, particularly London and it's people. It isn't all just pretty scenery and clothes. It's the harsh reality of poverty and more importantly, women's lives with no rights. Even women that married well had no rights. They were merely property: first they belonged to their fathers. Then they belonged to their husbands. Prostitutes were habitually abused by men, much worse than they are now. There were more of them in the 1800's. And poor women had little recourse, even the self-educated ones as in this Mini-Series.",1423180800,5,961,4.901840490797546
4910868,5,B005ZLF2OS,"WOW!

I absolutely loved this book. I read it while pregnant with my first child. I was almost 2 weeks past my due date and completely miserable, and this book distracted me from how uncomfortable I was and gave me something to do when I was unable to sleep. I am so glad they made a series because I tried to explain to my husband everything happening in the book (he couldn't see why I was unable to put it down) and he got confused. Now we can watch it together and he can understand!

I wanted to see this when the series first came out but I was unable to find it in my area. I finally found it on Instant Video and was so glad! It was totally worth the cost of the series and I will definitely watch it again.

*First, if you never read the book you might not really get this mini-series. Since I read the book and I can remember the motivations of the characters, I love the series. To me, the series is very faithful to the book and and makes the book more real and physical than it is in your head while reading. I really feel that this is meant to be a companion to the book, which is huge and so full of detail that it would be impossible to make a series about it without it costing a ton of money.

If you're at all interested in the series, do yourself a favor and check out the book from the library first! I can see how this would be a difficult series to fully enjoy unless you've read it.*

The cast, the costumes, the entire feel of the series is exactly what I was seeing in my mind when I was reading the book. Perfection to the enth degree. Some things were definitely left out of the series, I guess for the sake of time and ease of storytelling. But otherwise VERY little was different that I could see. All the most important parts of the plot were there, and each member of the cast completely embodied the character in the books.

Long, long story short:

Sugar is a prostitute in Victorian London, she works in a brothel run by her mother and madam, Mrs. Castaway. She meets William Rackham, who is the heir to Rackham's, a company that manufactures beauty and hygiene products for women. Sugar uses her intelligence and a considerable amount of feminine wiles to make herself indispensable to William, eventually moving into his home and becoming a governess to his child. William's wife, Agnes, has been driven mad by the controlling men in her life. William is faced with her care (he thinks she's crazy as a betsy bug) and most of the people around him think she belongs in an asylum. Sophie is his child, who is neglected in unimaginable ways, until Sugar comes to be her governess. William wants to have his cake an eat it too by having both his wife and mistress under one roof, but soon realizes that the situation cannot continue as he imagined it would in the beginning.

Agnes and her child Sophie are the only real victims in this story, a mother's heart will break for them. William and Sugar will make you feel both pity and disgust in equal measure. Dr. Curlew will freak you right out. The thought of him gives me the heebie jeebies right now, actually.

***This series will probably be HIGHLY triggering for anyone who has suffered from sexual assault or trauma. There's rape or coercion going on in some form about every 15 minutes in the show. Whether you're watching it on the screen in front of you, or simply seeing a struggling woman or hearing terrified screaming in the background. It's happening and it's very realistic. May also be triggering to those who struggle with eating disorders, as Agnes is very weight conscious and goes on strict diets in an effort to be thin and to stop her period from coming.***

**A ton of nudity and portrayal of sexual acts. I would give this an NC 17 rating if it were up to me. There's male and female full frontal nudity and the sex scenes are quite graphic. I'm nearly 30 years old, been married for almost 7 years, and I have a small child and I was blushing throughout the series. I'm not a prude by any means whatsoever and definitely no innocent, so that should definitely tell you something! Not for the faint of heart! Put the kiddies to bed before watching!**

When I saw Chris O'Dowd in the cast lineup I was very surprised as I am used to the goofy nerd in the IT Crowd. I never imagined him as William Rackham but now that I have, I love how he played him. Seeing him a serious role makes me want to see his other work. I don't know that I want to see his junk again though...

The entire time I was watching Romola Garai I was trying to figure out where I'd seen her before. I finally had to IMDB her and realized that she played Amelia Sedley in one of my favorite movies, Vanity Fair (the one with preggo Reese Witherspoon). If you've seen it you probably remember how Romola was stealing every scene away from Reese. I loved her as Amelia and she is superb as Sugar. There were only a few times in the book when I really connected with Sugar (I felt more of a kinship with Anges) but Romola brings more humanity to her. More fragility. Through Romola Garai's acting we are able to see just how much Sugar and Agnes have in common.

Speaking of Agnes, before now I had never seen any of Amanda Hale's work. I am now definitely going to check out The White Queen. Amanda Hale IS Agnes. Wow. Anyone who can play deranged like that is worth looking up!

I'm a huge fan of Shirley Henderson and although I felt she was an odd choice for Mrs. Fox, I now see how perfect she was for the role. I really enjoy watching her every time I see her on the screen.

Richard E. Grant terrifies me as Dr. Curlew. In the book as well as the series, Dr. Curlew is, in my opinion, the biggest villain of the story.

When the opening credits were going I saw Gillian Anderson's name and literally for half the series I was looking for her trying to figure out who she was supposed to be playing. I finally checked IMDB and had to rewatch part of the first episode. She is COMPLETELY unrecognizable as Mrs. Castaway. Or at least she was to me. In my opinion that just goes to show how great an actress she is. Especially since she was in a long running television show. I never think to myself, ""Scully with different hair/dress"". She absorbs every character she plays and really becomes them in a way that many actresses don't. Her work is so varied that is shows how she has mastered her craft. If you haven't seen Bleak House with Gillian Anderson, check it out ASAP! You can thank me later!

Mark Gatiss is Henry Rackham, and many people probably know him as Mycroft Holmes from Sherlock. Again I was staring at the screen wondering where I'd seen him before until my husband goes, ""Oh it's a ginger Mycroft."" I love how he played Henry, who wasn't a favorite of mine from the book. I felt he brought humanity to him and wasn't just a character on a page anymore.

I will definitely rewatch this series but now I feel I need to see a comedy. It'll get you down in a hurry. Be in a good place emotionally before starting this series!",1421366400,7,7021,4.306060606060606

The desaturated colour makes it look like a video clip, the sets are tacky,and the wigs are some of the worst I think I've ever seen. In one shot early in the film Romola Garai's wig actually comes unstuck, and that shot is still left in the final cut. She was wonderful in 'Attonement' but she totally lacks the sexual charisma that the character should have. Gillian Anderson is miscast, Richard E. Grant slithers in from time to time, and the pace is leaden. If you're expecting a beautiful period piece with something to say about the plight of women during this time, this probably isn't it. At one point it was planned as a feature film with Nicole Kidman, which might have been better. But some people on this site love it. To me it's a mess, and deeply depressing.

Granted, its been a while since I enjoyed the pages of the book, but I expected the movie to refill me with all that I found appealing about the book and more.  It had glimpses of the story I once found so great, but its effect on me can be summed up as a disappointing bore.

Maybe it was the mortician's makeup that seemed pasted on many of the actors, especially Sugar. The dead skin look was very disturbing and distracting.  I thought I saw the makeup getting better as Sugar's circumstances improved, but it might have just been wishful thinking.  I didn't dislike the movie, but I can't say I enjoyed much about it.

Amanda Hale was extraordinary as Agnes Rackham, bringing her to life in a way that was far better and more sympathetic than her portrayal in the book.  There were modern touches that made the series darker and more sinister than the book.  However, these were subtle and did not detract from the period ambiance.

4910886,4,B005ZLF2OS,"In the recent documentary series ""The Story of the Costume Drama,"" mention is made of the fairly recent trend in costume dramas on television to graphically depict sexual behaviour, as well as squalor and decadence. While some interviewed champion such representation as the brave choice, others wonder if enough isn't enough with all the self-indulgence.

The first few minutes of THE CRIMSON & THE WHITE offer an opportunity for those undecided on the matter to make an informed decision. The audience is subjected to graphic sex, every bodily function you can imagine and a general ""rub your face in it"" approach trotted out under the banner of realism. It alienates anyone with an imagination, as the ""wallowing in filth"" mentality overshadows the message of an otherwise powerful and potentially beautiful story of redemption. I really don't need to see Sugar pulling up her skirts and filling the chamberpot to understand the poverty and indignities she suffers. I am bright enough for that, in case anyone is interested for future reference. I suppose I should consider myself lucky they trust my judgement enough not to have CGId her digestive tract to show the process that led to her requirement for the chamber pot.

Based on the 800+ page novel by Michel Faber and adapted into a four-hour miniseries, the epic story that unfolds is one of great relevance to society: the refusal of a victim to allow her life circumstances to prevent her from loving others and thus perpetuate the cycle of abuse. This is the redeeming feature of THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE. After all, how many times do afternoon talk shows feature people who explain their aberrant behaviour and negative life choices by crying they were subjected to similar abuse while growing up? This is not uncommon. Accountability for one's life choices is a challenging and timeless theme. Therefore, by presenting a drama that says, in essence, ""there is a better choice to be made,"" the filmmakers have given us a gift, even if they've dropped it in the mud a few times before handing it over.

The story's central character is a much-abused prostitute named Sugar who rises above her life circumstances through a unique combination of professional skill, natural intelligence, and a passion for language and literature. Sugar is so well-educated that her knowledge of literature (Shakespeare and Tennyson, for example-it is a line from a Tennyson poem that provides the title of the program) almost strains credibility. She is also possessed of a keen business sense which makes her even more valuable to the man who ultimately offers her a way out from a dead-end existence, sugar-coated though it might temporarily be by her mysterious reputation for never disappointing her clients (meaning she has achieved great status in a time-sensitive profession).

Some outstanding performances propel this story of lust, revenge, redemption, madness, obsession and poetic justice. Romola Garai is excellent in the role of Sugar. She is matched by an effective performance by Chris O'Dowd as her alternately whining, endearing and annoying lover. The best performance for this reviewer is given by Amanda Hale as the mentally unstable wife of O'Dowd's character. She is magnetic and utterly convincing in her sensitive and heart-rending portrayal. And Gillian Anderson's portrayal of Sugar's madame is creepy enough to be an alien on ""The X-Files"" it is so remarkable.

Add to this mix production values that leave no detail left out, and one is easily transported into 1870s London, for better or for worse.

So much talent came together to produce THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE it is actually disheartening to think how it was misdirected into showing human depravity rather than striving for beauty. This is, after all, a story which attempts social relevance.

Any consideration of this program has to include the controversial elements as they are so prominently placed they cannot be ignored, rather like a dare-""there, what do you think of THAT?""

Therefore how much one enjoys THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE will depend a great deal on where one sits on the issue raised at the start of this review. Some of the sexual situations are depicted in a way that is borderline pornographic. Many of the encounters continue the recent British television trend to show front to back sex for some reason, (perhaps the easiest way to show both actors in close-up at the same time?) And really, do we need to see people urinating and vomiting and the over-all lack of hygiene shown in loving detail?

One other observation, speaking of trends in British programming. Does anyone writing music for films today know how to write an actual musical score nowadays? It seems so much of the current ""music"" is nothing but synthesized, generic-sounding, atmospheric soundscape rather an actual series of tunes. There are exceptions, but so often the background score is just a repetitive, pulsing electronic mishmash which is especially out of place in a period piece

In the end it all comes down to the story. Despite some loose ends that need explaining (what's with Sugar's dry skin throughout-is this an ironic metaphor for something in light of the fact that O'Dowd's character is a manufacturer of soaps and perfumes?)-the central theme of choosing not to perpetuate abusive behaviour makes THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE worth a look. Just be warned. There is a lot of unpleasantness and unnecessary indulgences that some will consider offensive.",1397433600,4,5512,5.06057268722467

4910889,5,B005ZLF2OS,"When fat and feckless William Rackham encounters the mysterious prostitute Sugar in the bowls of the Victorian underworld, this strangely addictive tale of false power lost and true power-the power of love -gained, begins.

William, the heir to a perfume fortune,  disregards the family business, while fancying himself a literary man despite his utter lack of talent. In the meanwhile, his wife, the angel of the house [ as upper middle class Victorians loved to think of those sexless paragons of virtue, their wives] is falling deeper and deeper into hysteria [ this time the malady actually rests with her attitude toward her womb]. Their child, a daughter, is ignored by both parents and relegated to a hideously barren nursery.

Enter Sugar, a young woman forced into prostitution at the age of thirteen by her own savagely cruel mother [ an unrecognizable and brilliant Gillian Anderson] who has not only managed to uplift herself by reading but is also writing a novel, an erotic tale of violence and revenge, which serves to keep her sane as she plies her trade.

The story unfolds as Sugar slowly infiltrates William's life, helping him gain power over both his business and domestic situation. But when she sees how deeply narcissistic and inept he is as far his family is concerned, she intervenes. How she loses her power [over William ] and regains it by finding love and compassion, within herself and for his wife and child, is at the heart of the story--and if you are at all sensitive, it will make you seethe with anger at the injustices perpetrated by the upper classes with all their hypocrisies, misogyny and convictions about the patriarchy and early stage capitalism.

The filth, poverty and disease is artistically presented, though skin maladies seem to afflict most of the denizens of the poor quarters-including Sugar herself who suffers from ichthyosis [ either genetic or could be brought on by stress, filth, lack of sunlight, poor nutrition, faulty immune system ]- and the fallen horse and homeless dogs are as fat as could be--so don't worry, there is nothing here that will give you nightmares. Though the true history of the era, when women worked long hours for pitiful wages in factories, or as domestics and seamstresses; when there was one prostitute for every 12 men in London and women were treated as chattel, when reformers and their houses were as unsavory as life on the street, when attitudes toward sex and women were cruelly unjust, when upper class men and sons of wealthy houses forced themselves on domestics and then placed the blame on the women themselves, should give everyone pause -and some understanding why Sugar initially behaved as she did.

All of the actors here do a stellar job with their parts, and the seedy streets of London in the 1800s is portrayed very effectively. I don't want to say too much so as not to spoil the plot for you, but the character of Agnes brought to mind the short story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

The costumes and settings of this movie are wonderful and the plot and acting are also wonderful.  This movie is dark to the extreme, yet you find yourself still applauding some of the characters as they struggle to survive and even better themselves.  The plight of women of the day is really shown...where there are very few choices, especially should your husband die and you are left with no income.

Spoilers below:

This is the story of Sugar (no other name) who is a prostitute in old London.  She was born to the life and knows little else, save that she also fancies herself a writer and wants to get away from what she is doing to survive.  To that end, she hooks up with a gentleman who has low self-esteem, also sees himself as a would-be writer, and an overbearing father who despairs of his son taking up his business (beauty products, soaps, lotions etc).  Sugar is said to give every man what he wants...and she does.  Among other things, she inspires William Rackham to be more self-assured and take more control of his life and business, enough so that he makes money to be able to keep her in better surroundings.  However, she soon discovers that all is not well in his home life, as his wife is in fragile mental health and thinks she will soon be called home to some ""convent"" in Heaven, even as she is tormented by the doctor who is supposed to be helping her.  Sugar slowly becomes more and more embroiled in the life of her sugar-daddy and his messed-up family, as well as in her own machinations.

The stars of this movie are really the two women, the prositute and the wife, the crimson petal and the white, and their own struggles to take back their lives and become who they really want to be...despite how society and circumstances try to make them be less than who they are.  This movie doesn't pull any punches as it shows the seamier side of life in London at that time and how even those who are wealthy can be trapped by expectations and their own fears and lack of education.  This movie shows madness and loss and desperation and yet it also contains a message of love and hope.

This is definitely not a movie for kids or teens or the faint-of-heart.  It has male and female nudity and some very rough, even brutal scenes.

But if you are interested in the plight of women in this time period, you might like this movie.  Even though it is very hard at times to watch and the feel of the movie can stick with you for a long while afterward.  This is not a movie lightly watched.",1388448000,5,2642,4.410309278350516

4910906,5,B005ZLF2OS,"i just actually came online to buy the book, as i saw the mini-series first. i'm a TOTAL cinephile myself & i am quite choosy, perhaps snobby when it comes to what i like/love, though i will watch most anything (within reason. some are just so obviously asinine that i won't even bother), i love it when i come across a really great film & this is a really great film in my estimation. for anyone who's read the book or not. sure it's a matter of taste & subjective as well, i suppose, but in my opinion, anyone who loves good cinema should see this film for what it is: an excellently produced, filmed & acted gem! :)
it IS ""odd"" as another reviewer mentioned, in the fact that it's unlike many/most films that are out there anywhere & it is noir-ish as well, (to quote the same reviewer), though not in the typical sense of a film noir. i consider it noir-ish in the literal definition of ""noir"", which is ""black"". it is dark...the subject matter, the characters, the feel of the film & then quite literally it is filmed darkly. omg, i love & adore the way it is shot! i need to see who the cinematographer was! he (& the director) did an amazing job. that's half the battle sometimes, the LOOK of a film, & this is one that hitchcock,
agreed! you said that very succinctly! :)
ps. i too watched the series first, but am now on here to buy the book. i can't wait to read it. though usually i do it the other way. read a book, then watch the film, because the book is always better, no matter how well done a film is. of course, there are a few films where they really captured it & also managed to include most everything from the story. conversely, when i watch a film then read the book, the book is usually ""ruined"" for me, as i already know the story & there aren't many surprises. but i'm going to give this one a go, after the fact, as well. i'm guessing that i won't have that problem here & i want to read all of the further details, thoughts, etc. that will be in the book. :)
shoot! i've kept this page open for ages to write my review & i never have. let me just say that this film is EXCELLENT!! it's very dark, weird (well not weird), but unusual, love the plot, love the twists and turns and the totally unexpected (especially in that day & age) ending. LOVE the cinematography & the beautiful & amazing shots. many of them reminded me of Rembrandt's paintings. the color, the composition. the acting was excellent as well. i LOVE & adore chris o'dowd, always for his comedy & his charm & charisma, but his character in this film was so weak, sometimes dark, very selfish & other bad qualities that i almost thoroughly disliked him! that is a nod to his excellent acting. comics always make the best actors when they do serious roles. they say all comics have dark & twisted souls, and/or have experienced a lot of pain in their lives, which is what makes them comics in the first place. i believe it!
i ADORE romola garai! she is amazing! stunningly beautiful, i love her w/the red hair (crimson eh? just as the white was the blonde), as i've only ever seen her as a blonde in other roles before & after this film. amanda hale was great too. i don't think i've ever seen her before this role. she played it to perfection. you felt deep sympathy and empathy for her & she was so preyed upon by everyone except sugar. sugar WAS her angel.
the supporting roles/character actors were fabulous too. the doctor...umm, richard grant, that's it, he was SO creepy & i just kept wanting him to get his comeuppance, though he never really did.
so, bottom line, i give it a hearty 2 thumbs up, or 5 stars as it were. i was completely spellbound & drawn into this dark & interesting world. i know i keep saying dark over & over again, but visually & emotionally that is the best word i can come up w/right now to describe it.

Readers love the novel because it gets into the heads of the characters and brings them to life. You feel their emotions and hear their thoughts and inner most secrets. The author is so skillful, you get to know the characters from the inside out and almost come to think of them as living people... Sadly it's these types of books and characters that are nearly impossible to bring to life on screen, no matter how talented the actors or directors are. Almost always, these books are lost in translation to the screen, and that's whats happened here to a certain extent. While readers will be able to forgive many of the flaws in this film adaptation because they know what the characters are thinking/feeling in any given scene, people new to the Crimson Petal world are likely to be disappointed.

In the novel, we come to know Sugar as a terribly abused young girl with a brilliant intellect and rich inner world, who is desperate to escape the brothel of her madame - who is also her own mother - Mrs. Castaway. We're privy to Sugar's every thought, feeling, hope, and fear as she slowly and skillfully navigates her way up through the rigid caste system of Victorian England. We watch her undergo tremendous personal growth, changing from a bitter, cynical, angry person into someone who breaks the cycle of abuse and conquers her past and her inner demons to be able to feel genuine love, affection, and happiness...

However, as we lack that inside view of the Sugar of the TV adaptation, she comes across poorly on screen. There's only so much inner dialogue even the most skilled actresses can outwardly portray. Film Sugar is almost drugged acting, and at times seems nearly deranged. Her eyes are blank, unblinking, staring. Her tone is flat, her expressions static, and she comes off as sullen and manipulative, instead of witty, charming, and fiercely hopeful. In essence, the Sugar we see on screen is the Sugar her customers see: a living doll, a plaything with no real thoughts and feelings of her own. If you've read the novel this is fairly easy to overlook as, in any given scene, you already know what Sugar is *really* thinking and feeling. But those who haven't read it will probably find themselves feeling unable to emotionally connect with Sugar or care about her since she is so closed off. But most damaging to the viewer's feelings for Sugar is the fact that not nearly enough time is spent explaining Sugar's book and why she writes it. The audience is given the explanation that it's a ""hate book"" against the men she services (this is partly true but it is also so much more than that). This does not help her gain the sympathy of the audience, especially since her lover William is used as the man in all of Sugar's dark torture fantasies (he is not, in the novel). If the viewer doesn't understand the character of Sugar, this makes her look insane, even evil, which she is not.

My advice: If you're a reader and you don't mind watching a film version of Crimson Petal that is more 'based on' the book instead of a faithful adaptation of it,  go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it for the most part. If you're not a reader and you're curious about the whole Crimson Petal obsession, but are on the fence and hoping to use the TV series as a cliffnotes version, skip it and read the book. Persevere and get past the first three chapters, the only time the author missteps by peppering them with vulgarity meant to shock and titillate the reader but instead annoys, and you'll be hooked, I promise.",1373846400,31,3623,4.602167182662539

4910930,5,B005ZLF2OS,"I always anticipate a movie- or made for TV film- to be the poor man's version of the book, with lots of inconsistencies.  I was pleasantly surprised with this one.
Given the immense length of Faber's novel by the same name (900+ pages), it's to be expected that there would be some slimming down, but they did a brilliant job of keeping it true to word.  The four episodes flew by, leaving me spellbound by how well the story of Sugar was brought to life.
The miniseries spends a little less time on the side characters than the book does, but this might make it more accessible to some people.  They still gave almost everyone their due, and the casting was excellent.  Romola Garai made a stunning sugar- I wasn't sure what to expect, not recognizing her from previous films, but was very impressed by the end of the series.  Her eyes draw you in and she's stunningly beautiful to watch.
Victorian London in both her underbelly and better-loved counterparts are brought to life, and you actually feel like you're right there, getting splashed by muddy rainwater as carriages roll by, and the sound of horses hooves  go clacking past.  Instead of making everyone look glamorous and Hollywood ready, the cast was realistic, and each beautiful in their own right, and all highly skilled in their craft.

For those who aren't familiar, the story is about a prostitute, named Sugar, born into the trade and struggling to survive in Victorian England.  As with any class, in such an era, security for a woman was essential before she aged, and this often only lay with securing a man, by being mistress or wife.  Sugar, however, is a bit unconventional, and staggeringly bright-  and through her, we are introduced to a motley crew of upper crust prudes, dandies, philanthropists and victims, as well as a string of prostitutes, imps, madame's, and poverty stricken persons living along side Sugar in her early days.  It's the story of Sugar, as she grows, but also of the people she meets; Faber tells his story in a way that makes you sometimes feel like you're a passerby, eavesdropping on the lives of others.  He doesn't sugar coat the realities of a hard life, or the flaws of the human heart; leaving you with honest, sometimes likeable, sometimes not, but always true, characters, who stay with you long after the film- or book- has ended.  This is a gritty, raw kind of story, and you'll have to dig deep for your happy ending- which Faber does give, by way of leaving things unanswered, and allowing you to fill in the gaps as you may,

Overall, an excellent adaptation, and watchable by anyone having read the book or not- though if you haven't, you owe it to yourself to pick up the book as well.

The DVD features 2 discs, with 4, one hour episodes.  Subtitles in English; series is in widescreen format, region 1.

One last thing: this is a BBC style series.  I say that because if you're not familiar with this style, and expecting a glossy, Hollywood type series, you'll find this one to be a lot different.  That doesn't mean bad- I think that they tend to be far more realistic, somewhat more akin to theatre;  minus the over-dramatic, maudlin type productions of the early BBC style.  For those who are unfamiliar with the style, I thought it was worth mentioning.",1366934400,7,3280,4.648180242634315

We see a young, wife being sexually abused by her family doctor in the name of science and slowly going over the edge. We see rampant prostitution, women and children, often in graphic detail. We see horrific living conditions with the squalor of overcrowding, both human and animal. This is not an uplifting movie.

Sugar is a fascinating heroine and the whole story is peopled with interesting, quirky, believable Victorians.

Garai showed a different side to her acting, playing a character who is dark, cunning, and vulnerable--so many facets and so much depth!  O'Dowd, who I'm used to seeing in comic pieces, is wonderful in this film, doing a bang-up job as William Rackham.  His performance makes me want to see him do more dramatic pieces.

Giving Garai and O'Dowd a run for their money is Amanda Hale, who as Rackham's mentally ill wife, offers up an absolutely top-notch performance.  What a role for her and so well done!

It shows the great divide between upper and lower classes in Victorian London, gorgeous frocks, haunting soundtrack, captivating characters and a hypnotic storyline.  I watched all four episodes in one sitting, I simply could not stop.  The contrasts of the long-suffering, innocent Agnes who's the white and the wily, alluring Sugar, who's the crimson.  Both express feelings of violation from the physical act of love, but one can tolerate and use it for a living whereas, the other cannot tolerate it at all and is driven mad.  It was an excellent analysis of the treatment of women in the Victorian times, by husbands, society, religion and even the medical profession.  When it ended, I immediately went online to try to find out what happens to two of the characters.  Also, I felt thankful for living in the era and the country I do, for having more choices in deciding my fate.

There were a couple of plot twists that I didn't see coming and a few that were completely obvious, but totally true to the Victorian time period in which the story is set.  Most of the characters aren't all that likable, and the plot meanders without a focus for a while, but the overall product has great visual impact and is fantastic entertainment.  This is not a traditional costume drama that you would usually associate with the BBC, as it is NOT appropriate for children on any level, and there is quite a bit of subject matter (abortion, prostitution, child abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, rape, just to tap the iceberg) that is ""not suitable for all viewers"".

Michael Faber's as carried through by the makers of this film series demonstrates an exceptional feel for the female character. Whether the upper class, privileged wife or the lowly woman forced into prostitution, all the women of this story suffer in some way because of their sex. Even the glimpses of the elderly neglected women on the streets show us their experience, including how they bond as sisters in prostitution, or exploit each other, as the mother of ""Sugar"" does to her daughter. Even the neglected daughter of the bumbling central male character, William Rackman, is neglected and secluded as the female child that cannot be an heir due to her femaleness. Throughout, females are social slaves, society ornaments, or sexual trinkets.
