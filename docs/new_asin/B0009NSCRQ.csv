2301977,4,B0009NSCRQ,"Noah Wyle is charming in his role as an unlikely hero:  A librarian.  With his career firmly established with the hit series, ER, Wyle takes his boyish good looks and affable demeanor to the bigger screen in this made for TNT Movie.  Although a blatant ripoff of the Indiana Jones series and with an affectionate nod to THE DA VINCI CODE, THE LIBRARIAN has enough of its own original charm to be entertaining and quite enjoyable.  There's also joy in seeing the unflappable Bob Newhart in his role as a karate fighting ex-Marine, whose line ""Is there anyone out there who wants another piece of me"" is outrageously funny.  Ditto to Jane Curtin as the stuffy secretary at the library and Olympia Dukakis as Wyle's overprotective mother, and you have a cast that's perfect.  Only Kyle MacLachlan, unusually boring in his role as the librarian's nemesis, spoils the brew.  With another LIBRARIAN due next year, one can see where there's a good chance Wyle may be playing Flynn Carson for quite a few years.",1125532800,6,1003,4.7298850574712645

2301979,3,B0009NSCRQ,"It is impossible to hate any movie where Bob Newhart fights ninjas!  (Yes you read the correctly)

The Librarian: Quest for the Spear is obviously a fun nod to action films (and with a title like this they hope to make it a series...Remo Willaims: The Adventure Begins anyong?).  If you're a fan of B-movie scholock then you'll have a fun time at all the winks, nods, and grins the writers and actors send our way.

The story centers around a college student loser who lives with his mother and then gets a job as THE librarian.  The person responsible for cataloging and retrieving all the rare lost items of history (think Excalibur, the Ark of the Covenant, Thor's Hammer, etc.).  Needless to say on his first day on the job the Spear of Destiny is stolen and he has to help retrieve it.

Action, comedy, and eye-rolling movie moments follow.

Now, I rated this a '3'.  If you HATE B-movie schlock, then you'll grade it a '1'.  If you like B-movie schlock then you have chosen wisely...'5'.",1122768000,5,993,4.52808988764045

2301982,5,B0009NSCRQ,"Noah Wyle is charming as Flynn, a professional student turned reluctant hero when he finds himself named The Librarian, and is charged with guarding a number of priceless artifacts he previously thought were only the stuff of myth. Flynn's race to recover the stolen section of the Spear of Destiny and prevent the Brotherhood of the Serpent from finding the remaining sections is Indiana-Jones-esque action and adventure at its light-hearted best.

Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart display their usual dry wit, with Newhart's scene with the bad guys near the end of the movie alone worth watching the movie for. Olympia Dukakis plays Flynn's mother, who wishes her boy would just find a good woman and settle down.

This is entertaining fare, a nice mix of action, adventure, brain teases and yes, a bit of romance. It isn't a big-budget Raiders of the Lost Ark production, but for a made-for-TV movie it does a fine job, and holds up on repeat viewing.",1116547200,140,949,4.851851851851852

2301984,2,B0009NSCRQ,"The Librarian: Quest for the Spear (Peter Winther, 2004)

Did anyone really bother to think this through? I find it rather doubtful.

The Librarian: Quest for the Spear, silly name that it has, stars Noah Wyle (ER) as Indiana Jones, trekking through the Amazon jungle with a gorgeous sidekick (Sonya Walger, from the wasn't-aborted-nearly-soon-enough American version of Coupling). The two of them originally can't stand each other, but eventually get to be quite a partnership. Woo. They're being pursued by some baddies who are after the same thing they are, but are quite content to sit back and let Wyle and Walger do all the work. Why hasn't an action hero yet decided to sit back and let the bad guys do all the work, then pluck the item in question from their hands when they've faced all the dangers?

So anyway, does it all sound familiar? It should. You've seen it in a million movies, from Douglas Fairbanks on down. There are some good ancillary roles, especially Bob Newhart as an unassuming caretaker-type, but Noah Wyle is a little too homey even to play the reluctant-action-hero role here; he always looks like he's out of his depth with the character, rather than the character being out of his depth with the situations.

Just really all-around badly done. **",1115942400,6,1278,4.821917808219178

2301996,5,B0009NSCRQ,"Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) applies for an opening for a librarian. He does not have the background per-say but he nevertheless impresses the interviewer Charlene (Jane Curtin) and gets the job. Guided through the library by Judson (Bob Newhart) we find that there is a lot more to the library than one would guess.

Flynn barley gets his fee wet when a vital spear (Spear of Destiny) part has been pilfered by a mysterious evil doer. Now he must learn his job OJT with the help of an aloof stoic female (as there ever was such a thing). The mission is to obtain the rest of the spear and not let the evil doer assemble it.

In September of 1912 Adolph Hitler at the Hofburg Museum. Hitler later said ""... I felt as though I myself had held it before in some earlier century of history. That I myself had once claimed it as my talisman of power and held the destiny of the world in my hands ...""

I actually had fun with this one. Could not believe the got so many people to do so many things. Bob Newhart makes an excellent ex-marine. How the ever got Olympia Dukakis to say her lines with a straight face we will never know. I think this actually is a project for out of work actors; but it worked for me. Sonya Walger did a great job for someone without a long track record.

This has been shown a few times on TV. However the DVD Contains scenes not broadcast.

I would say this is a fun way to pass time. I really doubt if it will ever become a series.",1504915200,,1454,4.178571428571429

This review is from: The Librarian - Quest for the Spear (DVD)
I've enjoyed all three installments of this series, the ""Quest for the Spear"" is the first, and the ""origin"" story. The Librarian is by definition a know-it-all, and this aspect of the character is most often worked into the story in a humorous fashion. I found the ""surprise appearance character"" in this movie to be quite interesting, and well played by Kyle McLaughlin.

The Librarian series is Indiana Jones Lite, and that's just fine. There is plenty of humor and other elements to interest adults, and action and 'cool factor' for kids to enjoy ... or vice-versa. LOL

The one thing the Librarian might want to work on, though, is hiding his trail. Where ever he's heading, the bad guys always show up just behind him, and occasionally even beat him there!

These movies are worthwhile if, for no other reason, to see what may turn out to be some of Bob Newhart's final roles. In this movie, Bob Newhart enjoys the very first fight scene in his long and entertaining career!",1503273600,2,1147,4.782828282828283

2302046,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I liked the movie. A few years ago when we still had Cable TV, I caught a few episodes of the TV Series ""The Librarians"" and recently bought the first 2 seasons to watch when I stumbled across the 3 movies. I opted to purchase the movies and watched the first one and enjoyed it. I am glad that I will watch the movies first. The entire family watched and enjoyed it as well. It's sort of like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the stone but I think it is better.

A professional student thrust out in the real world and a mother who only wants his son to be successful and find a woman and ""live"" life makes for a great plot line. The job to be ""The Librarian"" comes along at the right time and this anti-hero turns out to be the hero and gets the woman in the end.

I am looking forward to the rest of the movies and then the series.",1482883200,6,839,3.988095238095238

Noah Wyllie plays the librarian with a touch of humour, he still lives with his mom played by Olympia Dukakis, never having a ""real"" job or girlfriend. He gets a position as the Librarian, goes to the basement, is greeted by Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart who are his bosses. There are a lot of artifacts downstairs, protected by previous Librarians. The Serpent Brotherhood steals one of the 3 parts of the magical spear of destiny and he is contracted to find all three parts.

2302174,5,B0009NSCRQ,This movie is older but I always enjoy revisiting this title.  There is room for improvement on some of the shots such as the really bad image of the bridge and waterfall... but the story is fun.

But this is not just any librarian.  The library consists of mythic items that have magical powers and there are still many items missing.  the librarian seeks these relics and stores them in the library where they can do no damage.

But someone has broken into the library and taken part of the Spear of Destiny.  Flynn, with no practical experience in artifact retrieval, must travel the globe and get the other two pieces of the spear before the thieves, or they will harness a power unlike any known to modern man.  Oh, and to find these pieces, Flynn needs to decode the Language of the Birds (believed to be the language spoke by all, prior to the Tower of Babel, but unknown to man for more than 5000 years) in under 24 hours.

2302284,4,B0009NSCRQ,"I liked this enough to buy it.  It's got a campy, quirky humor and it's light entertainment that is a bit sophomoric at times.  The cast is really good.  I like Olympia Dukakis in her role as the librarians mother a lot.  It's a good story, even if it isn't an elaborate production.  They've done the best with what they had, and it's visually appealing to watch.  There's a bit of adventure,mystery, and action combined with light comedy that I find strangely soothing and fun.

Noah Wyle in his role as The Librarian is a whole lot of nerdy, a good bit of cute, and occasionally rather handsome.  He brings a lot to the role and is very fun to watch.

For the record though, I'm an old woman that enjoys kids movies and tv shows.  If you like 'serious' action movies with well though out logic, this might not appeal to you.  If you like ""The Goonies"" I think you might enjoy this.",1452211200,4,883,4.323170731707317

2302315,4,B0009NSCRQ,"Wow has Amazon finally paid for its pro-gay marriage campaigning? A VOD for $1.99 again? About knocked me out of my chair.

Anyway some ""geek"" (I guess I have to use that word as that is what our society calls people who are intelligent and curious--not enough high school grads who cannot read, ""write cursive"", or pick their state/country out on a map I guess) is sorta kicked out of college as he has made a career out of getting degrees. Some professor graduates him. The geek is devastated as he doesn't know what to do with himself. He has no girlfriend and doesn't date. He has no friends. He loves learning. His mom is trying to get him a job and gf. ANyway he lucks up on a job interview with the mystical NYC public library where obviously there is an underground vault of the world's treasures. He gets the job. Becomes some sort of Indiana Jones. From there he goes on a globe trotting excursion just like Indiana or the National Treasurer movie guy played by Nicolas Cage. In fact this is a smaller scale repo of those movies.

The one thing I hate is what I hear all too often on the radio, TV, movies--anywhere that is broad cast for a large coast to coast audience. Whenever someone wants to mention ""religion"" as opposed to Christianity they seem to select something from the Old Testament to get the Jews on board with the message and by proxy Christians. But whenever it comes to comment from the New Testament then that is a no-go or always prefaced with a ""so the story goes""--the doubt for the Jews, atheists, etc is taken into consideration. This movie did the same thing. It is offensive to Christians like me. When the Arc of the Covenant is commented on it is with fact--again Old Testament. With then spear that is related to the Roman who slashed Christ's side is mentioned it is ""supposedly"". I mean I've never heard of such a sword. Think it was made up. But why the doubt in association with Christ? Such a turn off.",1444867200,,1947,4.450980392156863

The Librarian Quest For The Spear  stars Noah Wyle as Flynn Carsen. Carsen gets offered a job interview  at the Metropolitan Public Library and his life is dramatically changed one he decides to go for the interview. Hes extremely close to his mother Margie (Olympia Dukakis) who is rooting for him to find a romantic relationship and a stable job.  Charlene  (Jane Curtin) and fellow library director  Judson (Bob Newhart) go ahead and hire Flynn Carsen for the librarian position. The job that Flynn Carsen is hired into ends up being even better than he expected. He discovers that a woman by the name of Sonya Walger (played by Nicole Noone) is hired to protect him after he is sent on a mission to retrieve back an important Destiny Spear stolen from the library.  He finds this out after an attempt on his life from an encounter via the Serpent of Brotherhood group members of Lana (Kelly Hu), Rhodes (David Dayan Fisher), and Edward Wilde (Kyle Maclachlan).",1444867200,2,1245,4.631818181818182

Olympia Dukakis, Jane Curtain, Bob Newhart, and Noah Wyle really hold up their end of the deal. The premise, the world's most elusive archeological treasures exist in this super-secret, heavily guarded enclave, is fun and interesting. The flaw, and it's a big one, is that Sonya Walger and Wyle have absolutely no chemistry. Walger's character's arc starts with being portrayed as a woman who has access to social power because she is stunningly gorgeous, to a woman who is powerful in her own right, but wounded, to a woman who is healed when she succumbs to the male lead's terminally nerdy yet paradoxically irresistible allure. It is so absurd and unbelievable from start to finish that it ruins the movie's otherwise appealing qualities.

Sonya Walger is an interesting actress, but the character was too cartoonish for her to play well. The result is a cringe-inducing embarrassment of a movie.",1437868800,2,982,5.024539877300613

Id missed them when they were on TV, and somehow never got around to tracking them down after that.  But with the TV series starting up, they aired all those movies, so I was finally able to go back and watch them.  I started with The Librarian: Quest for the Spear, which I enjoyed.

Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) is a professional student who is shocked and upset one day to learn that he is being kicked completely out of college for at least six months.  Going home to his room, in the house he shares with his mother (Olympia Dukakis), he finally gets the wakeup call that he needs to go out and do something with his life.  When he is asked to come in for an interview at the library, he thinks hes found his job.

Only when he gets the job, he realizes that it is not about guarding books.  Hes actually working of an organization that tries to keep the supposedly powerful objects of the world safe and hidden.  That first night Judson (Bob Newhart), his new boss, is attacked and a third of a spear is stolen.  Now Flynn must use research to go into the Amazon and find the next piece before the villains get the entire thing and the power that goes with it.

Watching it, I couldn't help but compare this to Indiana Jones.  I mean, the quest for the mythical objects is a bit obvious, right?  There are plenty of superficial elements that are different, but for the most part, it is true.

But you know what?  I didn't care.  I was having fun following Flynn as he finally gets some real world experiences.  Granted, most of us don't have our lives threatened multiple times our first week on a new job, but this is a movie, right?  The situations he gets into and out of are creative, and the ending is great.  There were a few slow spots, but that wasn't enough to ruin the film overall.

Everyone seems to be having fun in this film.  Yes, the acting is fine with no performances that will pull you out of the film.  But I think they were all enjoying working on it, which often comes through to me.  As a fan of Lost and FlashForward, I got a kick out of seeing Sonya Wagner playing the female lead, Nicole Noone, who meets up with Flynn to protect him on his quest.

Not all of the effects worked, especially big green screen shots.  But this is a made for TV movie, so Im really not complaining there.

So if youve missed The Librarian: Quest for the Spear, find a way to change that today.  While it might not be the most original story out there, it is fun, and youll be glad you watched it.",1435104000,,2594,4.251533742331288

Even after previously seeing the second and third movies, and the subsequent Librarians season 1 on TNT, backfilling with this DVD was well worth the purchase and viewing. Very good production quality for TV, effective special effects, music supports action/adventure. Great female companion for our bookworm hero. Only slight disappointment is that each movie has a different female companion - hero is no Bond, refreshingly.

There is no reason parents and kids cannot watch fantasy adventure together without the fearsome aspect of over the top effects, monsters and villains when the Librarian shows up for work.  More like Warehouse 13 than Indiana Jones, designed to be as predictable as breakfast.  Knowing what's coming is part of the fun.  Mixed with more than a little slapstick silliness and made for TV movie production budget, is a cohesive story and fine acting.  Noah Wyle spins the silliness with such glee and natural charm, it's hard to keep from snickering, knowing there was some fun playing the scenes and he does so without delivering condescending haminess.  I have a really hard time with the abusive comedy being produced the last 20 years that little or none of it is funny to me.  I could not resist a few grins and chuckles watching this one.  These days, Kyle MacLachlan plays a very sinister and frightful character in the Agents Of Shield series, but in this production, he's got shackles on and keeps a lid on the cringe factor.  Kids old enough to handle a slightly scary story book should be able to handle this movie.  Watch it to experience Noah charm if nothing else.",1419897600,2,1230,4.759433962264151

Kelly Hu as one of the villains was surprisingly amusing when showing her admiration of Flynn.  Watching it, one wishes she was given more of an opportunity for comedy.  Her shyness when approaching him, and later, the way she beams when she is sitting next to him, guarding him, although unimportant in the context of the movie and probably being less than 10 seconds in all, make me think she has untapped potential for comedy.

*Minor spoiler alert.*

The library has guards shown at the beginning but when the good guys find library broken into no one worries about the guards or even mentions them. Are they hurt and need medical help, are they dead, or what? Even in a fantasy that should be a normal human first response at least for the good guys.

If you have the bad guys are in a airplane at 30,000 feet and seemingly within a very short time in a jungle driving jeeps following the good guys how did they get there. Where did they get the jeep and supplies. And if the good guys are on an overgrown jungle path barely wide enough for one person how can they be following in jeeps?

If the foot bridge across the gorge collapsed just as the good guys finished crossing how the heck can the jeep driving bad guys catch up in seemingly a short time later.

2302815,5,B0009NSCRQ,"As a Made for Television program, the Librarian has a great feel.  The acting, especially Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain, is a hoot.  Yes, this is totally a rehash of Laura Croft's stuff, but what the heck.  It seems like just about everything is a rehash of something.  At least this one has its own feel.

A Librarian is one who is chosen to safeguard the treasures of the planet.  Whether it be the Spear of Destiny -this episode's center- to the Goose the Lays the Golden Egg, the Librarian must keep watch and protect.

Noah Wyle is an unlikely candidate for the position.  He is a nerd, straight out.  But he's a loveable nerd who does his best to find the three pieces of the Spear of Destiny before the bad guys get ahold of it.  As we are told by Newhart's character, ""Hitler had only one piece of the spear and look what he did"".

This is a family movie although just about any age group will appreciate it.  It's got action, drama, a bit of romance and intrigue.  All in all, it's very enjoyable.",1417996800,,1005,4.310160427807487

The graphics are odd, it drags in the middle.  The best part is the beginning when they ""find the librarian.""  I watched it home with a cold, and I was entertained....but if you expect ""Harry Potter"" quality, you won't find it.  The story line felt like most ""pilots"" do when the cast isn't quite gelled and the writers haven't written for the actors they have, but rather written for those they ""envisioned"" which in a pilot doesn't always work.

It has a few too many of those dialogues that make you squirm in your seat in embarrassment for the goofy lead character, but aside from that, it's relatively humorous, with a few touching scenes, and a predictable outcome without anyone getting killed (that I recall, anyway), which is kind of nice. There's even a girl-fights-girl scene near the end, although it doesn't last nearly long enough for me to recommend as a treatment for moderate-to-severe depression in middle-aged men. All said, though, this is worth watching if you want a light-weight action-adventure movie without gore galore, salacious sex, or post-modern moral ambiguity.",1416873600,4,739,5.016260162601626

2302943,4,B0009NSCRQ,"The Librarian: Quest For The Spear (2004-tvm). DVD Running Time: One Hour, 45 mins. Extended version.
Directed by Peter Winther. Written by David N. Titcher.
First tv-movie in the series. Originally broadcast on TNT cable network.

We meet Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) who is taking a tour through the Great Pyramid and reading the Third Dynasty hieroglyphics. Well, actually it's a pyramid being built in the University.  He is so excited about the project, but Professor Harris (Mario Ivan Martinez) has no use for him anymore. Flynn has more than enough degrees and it's time the Professor let him go. The Professor tells him he is avoiding life out there. Go get a job instead of taking the same classes over again. He has already talked to the administration. His degree has been signed off. Standing on an upper floor, a man by the name of Judson (Bob Newhart) watches Flynn and observes him.
  The next day, Flynn receives a magical invitation for an interview at the Metropolitan Public Library. After waiting in a super, long line of a spiral staircase, he is interviewed by a touch cookie, Charlotte (Jane Curtin). After getting through to her with his intellect, he is hired, but on a six-month trial basis.  Judson magically appears and welcomes him. He takes Flynn to a secret passage, a secret elevator and a large secret room that is probably as long as a football field. Real antiquities are housed here. The real Ark of the Covenant, the real Mona Lisa painting, the real Pandora's Box and many more.
  After the Spear of Destiny is stolen from the library, Flynn is asked on his first day on the job to go on an adventure to find the second missing piece in the Amazon jungle of Mexico. If all three pieces are brought together, it would be dangerous in the wrong hands.

Also in the cast: Olympia Dukakis, Lisa Brenner, Sonya Walger, Kyle MacLachlan, Kelly Hu, Clyde Kusatsu, Mark Franco, Antonio Monroi, Leon de Luis.

Filmed in Equestrian Statue of Charles IV, Plaza Manuel Tolsa, Churubusco, Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico.

2302945,4,B0009NSCRQ,"Love the movies (all 3) even if they weren't the best in production standards. Good stories, good characters, but really not bad for 'made for TV' (back when they were made) Was good to see 'Spear' come out as this was the hardest to find.",1396224000,,239,4.333333333333333

For his birthday I found three of the Librarians, and gave them to him.
We made a weekend of them , and both of us enjoyed them.",1389916800,,231,3.8333333333333335
2302957,5,B0009NSCRQ,"We love this movie series! The adventure mixed with fantasy is very enjoyable. It's neat how he can get out of difficult situations, because of knowledge he has from reading and studying.",1389830400,,187,4.875
2302958,4,B0009NSCRQ,"Although it looked like it would be in Chinese/Japanese or some such, the movie played very well in English, and without any glitches.  Took slightly longer to arrive, but that information was provided up front, so not a surprise.",1389830400,,230,4.897435897435898

2302960,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I'm a ""Librarian"" fan. The only thing I don't like about the series is that they didn't make more movies. The three, including the ""Quest for the Spear"" are not enough. This is the first of the three movies in which Flynn Carsen (Noah Wylie) becomes the Librarian and goes on his first adventure. The supporting cast is great, and the film is fun from beginning to end.",1388880000,,369,4.4411764705882355
2302961,5,B0009NSCRQ,"We love these movies.  Yes, the characters aren't deep, but they're not supposed to be, as it's a comedic action movie.  Very engaging, excellent pacing, and enjoyable characters that you quickly enjoy and want to find out what happens to them next.",1388707200,,249,4.904761904761905
2302962,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I saw this at somebody's house when it first came out on DVD. I thought it was pretty good - isn't there a part of everyone who really wishes that there was a place where Excalibur, Pandora's Box and all the rest were real and safeguarded?

I saw the third on at the flea market and snapped it up.  I didn't realize that even were three of them.  I saw the first two at someone's house when they first came out on DVD and remembered them as pretty good.

I bought this one for my niece and nephew ( 7 and 5 ).  The LOVED it.  Thanking me again for it was the first thing out of my niece's mouth the NEXT time I came over.  Can't beat that.",1388534400,,639,3.9069767441860463
2302963,3,B0009NSCRQ,"Surprisingly entertaining. I don't think, however, that it deserves such high praise as it gets. Acting was better than I thought it'd be, as well as the humor and adventure/action. The HUGE downfall is the atrocious special effects/CGI. It looks like they had a $300 budget. None of the action scenes looks remotely real -- waterfalls, bridges, tombs, nothing. That was a huge killer for me.",1388448000,,392,4.954545454545454
2302964,5,B0009NSCRQ,"A fine movie!  Fun, exciting, and interesting throughout.  Noah Wyle is totally convincing as a warm hearted being who is chosen as the Librarian.  His antics and adventures will keep you spell bound!",1388188800,,200,5.0
2302965,4,B0009NSCRQ,"This film is oodles of silly fun. I've been looking for a Blu-ray or DVD copy of it for a while.  Be aware that all the text on the back of the film case will not be in English, but the actual film is.",1388102400,2,201,3.5681818181818183

2302973,5,B0009NSCRQ,Bob Newhart is the added bliss in this series as Noah Wyle tries to complete his quests.  Lots of twists and turns in the plot that keeps you quessing.  Love it.,1380672000,,161,4.161290322580645

2302980,5,B0009NSCRQ,My husband and I really enjoyed the first movie of the series because it is entertaining.  The story is probably the best of the series.,1377129600,,136,4.44

2302983,5,B0009NSCRQ,I loved this movie and its sequels that were premiered and re-run on television. When I found this one online for such a low price I couldn't help but add this timeless favorite to my home collection. I plan to buy the sequels.,1376611200,,227,4.3023255813953485

2302986,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I love the Librarian series and they were hard to find. Although you can tell this one must have had a lower budget because of the special effects, this one is still my favorite. The introduction to the characters is great and what a stellar cast with Noah Wylie and Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain and more.",1375488000,,305,4.368421052631579
2302987,4,B0009NSCRQ,"I'm glad this title, the first of The Librarian trilogy, was re-released for me to complete my collection.

2302988,5,B0009NSCRQ,And enjoyed it so much that I couldn't wait for a sequel to come out.  Noah Wyle outdoes himself with just enough ingrained intelligence and just enough comedic spirit to make it all worthwhile!,1374969600,,194,4.705882352941177

In this fantastic episode, Flynn must find the Spear of Destiny which was used to pierce the side of Christ on the cross before the Serpent Brotherhood does. The adventure takes Flynn from New York to South America to Tibet. The action is non stop and fun for everyone. The movie arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1370390400,,567,4.623762376237623
2302998,4,B0009NSCRQ,This is the pilot for the TNT movie series which includes two other movies.  Series is somewhat like Indiana Jones only made for TV.  Best to watch this movie before you watch the other two.  It explains how Noah Wyle became the librarian,1370131200,,238,4.488372093023256
2302999,4,B0009NSCRQ,These are kind of a poor mans Indiana Jones but fun none the less. The acting is pretty good and the special effects are quite well done. You really should watch them in order as they build on one another.,1370044800,,205,4.15
2303000,5,B0009NSCRQ,I love the Librarian Series because I enjoy watching Noah Wyle.  The first two movies are my favorites.  The Judas Chalice is okay-Looking forward to a fourth installment!,1369008000,,171,5.071428571428571

Also, this one film is the most difficult to find.  It was the first and maybe the best film of the Librarian series.",1365465600,,293,3.9322033898305087
2303006,5,B0009NSCRQ,I love this movie and was looking for it for awhile. Of course I found it on Amazon. I'm very happy with this purchase and the shipping was fast and the quality of dvd was great. No complaints at all. Thank you.,1365033600,,211,4.0476190476190474
2303007,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I love most movies that have anything to do with archeology and these ones are no exception. I love them! I have been wanting to buy them and I found the first one (Quest for the Spear) in the $5 bin at Walmart the other day and grabbed it up without hesitating. I'm hoping the other 2 come out for that price in the near future. I did check Walmart.com and Amazon's prices for the others, but they are both above $10. Still not a bad price, but I can't swing it right now. If you like the Indiana Jones movies, you will love these!",1364947200,,532,4.076190476190476
2303008,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I first saw this several years ago, when we rented it from Blockbuster. I was truly hesitant, because it looked like one of those low-budget movies that you can never get back the time you spent to watch it. However, once it started I was immediately laughing; and that laughing didn't stop until long after the credits rolled. Years later, and I still love it! After we had watched it, we tried to find it on DVD, but were unable to. A month or so ago when we saw it here on Amazon, I was in shock! A good shock, that is. I had thought they weren't making DVD's of it anymore!

This movie is perfect for all ages; a parody of adventure movies about treasure hunters, this movie has you rolling around laughing; without making it seem like the makers hated Indiana Jones and the other movies this is a spoof of. If you enjoy comedy, you will LOVE this movie! Definitely worth grabbing for your DVD collection!",1364774400,,909,4.378698224852071

2303010,5,B0009NSCRQ,This is the first of a 3-part series.  I had the other two but not this one as it was out-of-print.  The law of supply and demand made the only existing copies rediculuously expensive.  Now the price is reasonable.,1363737600,,214,4.435897435897436
2303011,4,B0009NSCRQ,"This first version of The Librarian is great. Tongue-in-cheek acting keeps the story and the action enjoyable thru the whole movie. Mom, as played by Olympia Dukakis, sets such a great background for the whole story.",1362787200,,216,5.027777777777778

2303016,5,B0009NSCRQ,"Shades of Indiana Jones!  This particular librarian spends very little time in the building; instead spends most of his time saving the world.  This is a highly entertaining series with Noah Wyle playing the lead with just the right touch of whimsy.
Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin add their particular personas in ""supporting"" roles.
In this first of the series, the Librarian must go after the Spear of Destiny which has been stolen from the storage area below the building.  This artifact has the ability to give to its possessor, the power over life and death.
This film was followed by two other episodes that I am aware of, Return to King Solomon's Mines, and Curse of the Judas Chalice, both of which are worth owning.  They have been out for a while. Nothing deep, just fun viewing.",1360195200,,786,4.673913043478261
2303017,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I was surprised why the first Librarian production was priced so high in the US, while the other two were the expected reasonable cost. Searching through reviews and Amazon listings, I found this offerring to be both reasonable cost and significant quality. You just have to get past the Korean box labelling, but the movie content is all English language and subtitles were off by default.  The production work is of course fantastic as with all of the Librarian series, but it was helpful to find this lower cost version to complete the collection.",1357603200,,550,4.851063829787234

2303020,3,B0009NSCRQ,I did not like the fact that it has a foreign language on the cover-nowhere was I told that it was not printed in English- we have not seen it yet- it was purchased as a Christmas gift,1356220800,,184,3.8684210526315788
2303021,1,B0009NSCRQ,I sent money through Pay Pal THEN was told it was out of stock! A bunch of crap! It shouldn't have been advertised.,1353888000,,115,4.043478260869565
2303022,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I purchased the Librarian tv movies because I love Noah Wyle. I saw the last show of the series in full, but this one I only got to see snips of. Having all three is a bonus. You get to see the Librarian ""grow up.""",1350777600,,214,3.7777777777777777

2303025,5,B0009NSCRQ,"After watching one of the episodes on TV, and enjoying it, I bought the trilogy.

Good entertainment. Sometimes we (or at least me) like something that's not too 'heavy' or too dramatic - just fun.

These three movies fit that description - sort of Indiana Jones and Warehouse 13 at a more enjoyable pace. Maybe not for the 'action addicts', but easier to watch.

Excellent cast - who can resist Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain's special talents. All of the leading ladies have gone on to other series or movies - Castle, Burn Notice, Flash Forward - to name a few.

2303030,4,B0009NSCRQ,"I bought the second movie in this series first, quickly followed by the rest.

They're fundamentally a lower budget Indianna Jones series that I actually found more entertaining than the Indy films.

Quest for the spear involves finding the spear that pierced the side of Christ on the cross - actually it's a threefold quest.

The interpersonal dynamics that build between the characters is worthy of much higher rated films, and the dynamics between humans and inanimate objects can be just as entertaining, if not more so at times.

The movie begins in a most unusual manner, with a firing and job invitation, it simply gets better as it moves along. The blend of outright comedy, dry humour and tongue in cheek comedic talent is so successfull it's only really noticable upon reflection after the show has finished.

I'd rate it as follows, for the genere:

Beleivability ****
Special Effects ****
Storyline ****
Acting ****
Sets *****
Comedy ****
Value ***** (paid under $10)

He finds a position that requires his unique mix of talents (or did the position find him?) and finds himself in a series of dangerous situations, deadly threats, and close calls.  The movie is, above all, fun.

I watched it with my teen-aged daughter and we both had a blast!

I also bought the second and third movies in the series.  I think it's a shame that the powers-that-be make it so difficult to get a movie of this quality and appeal.

2303039,4,B0009NSCRQ,"Watching The Librarian: Quest for the Spear is a pleasant way of spending 2 hours. It's a difficult movie to categorize but is has elements from the comedy, romance, action, and fantasy genres. The strong points are the excellent casting and strong acting. The production values are only adequate; one gets the impression that the budget was not overly generous. The screenplay was also just adequate; once the film gets beyond introducing the ""Library"" premise there are not too many surprises left in the film.

The film is raised above the mere adequate level by the cast. Noah Wyle exudes charm and is very likable in the title role. Sonya Walger is also outstanding and her scenes with Wyle are a joy to watch. Bob Newhart is at his deadpan best and Jane Curtin is also good. Olympia Dukakis gets as much as she can out of her few scenes.

The villain of the piece, played by Kyle MacLachlan, is unfortunately one of the weaknesses of the script. MacLachlan does his best but there just isn't enough depth to the character. Because of this a major plot twist is much less effective than it might have been. His minion, played by Kelly Hu, is just eye candy. Her infatuation with Wyle leads to nothing and seems to have been in the script just to give Hu some lines.

Despite all this the chemistry between Wyle and Walger, the support of Newhart, Curtin, and Dukakis, and the interesting Library premise are more than enough to keep the film off the ground. I will check out the other Librarian releases.",1286150400,,1509,4.623134328358209

I like this movie better as more of a 3.5 stars in that it's not as good as the Indian Jones movies it tries to emulate but much better than most of the made for TV dross that comes out. Noah Wyle as the nebbish scholar who has spent his entire life learning and getting degrees sells this movie.

2303050,4,B0009NSCRQ,"You know that nerd chic has made its mark when a globe-hopping search for the mystic amulet stars a librarian. Glasses, no girlfriend, the whole geeky stereotype. But, the number of academic degrees add up close to room temperature, and this quest uses every bit of his encyclopedic knowledge.

Noah Wyle (played by Flynn Carson) isn't an Indiana Jones, who becomes a hero by violating the nerdy image. He wins by his wiles, completely embracing his inner geek. And outer one, for that matter. Nicole (Sonya Walger) plays his gorgeous guide/guard, who alternates between pulling his helpless hide out of danger and following him as he deciphers clues from an ancient book.

[Spoiler!]
The one scene in the movie that might best characterize its spirit comes near the end. It has Bob Newhart going all Chuck Norris on a roomful of heavily armed badguys. Talk about tongue in cheek!
[End of spoiler]

The adventure is chaste and bloodless, mostly, and keeps a humorous tone throughout. And, although he's inept in many ways, the movie never descends to the nerd-bashing that seems so culturally ingrained. In fact, a high point of the flick comes when Nicole starts the beatdown on the female badguy with the challenge ""Find your own geek!"" It's good silly fun, with a reminder that bravery goes with brains as easily as with brawn. And maybe, just maybe, the babe goes for the brains.

2303052,5,B0009NSCRQ,"I've watched all three of the Librarian movies, so this will sort of be a conglomerate review of the trilogy.  Flynn Carson is adorable as a thirty-something, professional student whose head stores more facts than Encyclopedia Brittanica or reputable "".org"" sites.  After 16 years of college, he has 22 different degrees (12 bachelor's, 6 master's, and 4 Ph. D's).  According to my math (and no differential equations involved with this computation), he should be 34-years-old in the first installment.  Yet he celebrates his 32nd birthday in the second movie, when logically, he should be celebrating his 35th.  Ahh well, maybe he was dual-enrolled.

His mother is forever setting him up with young women, including his own (a few times-removed) cousin in the third movie.  Flynn realizes after a blind-date (arranged, of course, by his fretting mother) with a social worker, that he needs to change in some ways.  So, when a Harry Potteresque invitation to apply for ""The Librarian"" post at the Metropolitan Museum of New York arrives unexpectedly in the mail, Flynn applies for the job.  He is selected because he can apply all his book learning to deduce that Charlene, the interviewer, had a reconstructive nose job in early childhood, currently suffers from swollen glands, and has two cats who left practically invisible traces of fur on her blazer.  He also knows what's important in life, gleaned from a recent pep talk with his mother:  it's the heart that matters more than the mind.

The librarian job is a tour-de-force, and Flynn's prolonged studenthood was a serendipitous (or not so-serendipitous) preparation for the job description: saving the world.  These movies could also be called ""The Curator,"" as it seems like a private collections art curator is more apropos; Flynn repeatedly rescues or destroys mythical artifacts that have magical powers.

After much adventure and near-death experiences, Flynn successfully retrieves the spear.  However, I thought that one detail was inconsistent. The spear was purposely split into thirds to render it less dangerous.  These three parts were hidden across the globe, one of which was housed at the Museum, where it was stolen.  The splintered pieces of the spear harnessed enough energy from a pyramid alignment that the spear became whole again.  Yet, Flynn is not asked to break the spear apart again once it is returned to the library.  I would have thought that he'd have to arrange for it to be splitered again and then hide the remaining two pieces at other remote geographical locations.

Still, a lot of fun.  The character of Judson is mysterious.  The third movie implies he is much more than director of The Library, perhaps a supernatural deity. Flynn tells Judson, ""I know who you are.""  Flynn persists, ""You're over two thousand years old,"" whereas Judson shakes his head and sallies, ""Two thousand years old, think about it, now that is just insulting.""

In these movies, myth is history and the far-fetched is fact.  A lot of fun and undergirded by light humor.  I absolutely love the characterization of Flynn Carson.  This character has no idea how gorgeous he is, and he makes bookish and nerdy smolderingly hot.",1245456000,,3197,5.051526717557252
2303053,4,B0009NSCRQ,"The Librarian series should provide good fun for fans of the Indiana Jones genre, and ""Quest for the Spear"" does a fine job of introducing the premise and the continuing characters. Notably, we meet the nerdy-but-adventurous Flynn Carson (Noah Wyle), who is persuaded to abandon his comfortable niche as a professional student and apply for a job at the mysterious Metropolitan Library--which does indeed have books but is mainly dedicated to safeguarding legendary artefacts such as Pandora's Box and the Sword Excalibur. When the Spear of Destiny is stolen, Flynn, as the Librarian, must trek through the Amazon and over the Himalayas to thwart the villains determined to use the spear for evil purposes.

Now, normally, we're (mostly my girlfriend) are very critical about the movies we watch (Highland the source, Indiana Jones: The crystal skull both got very low thumbs down). We knew the ending before the movie even began and the special effects just weren't that special. But we watched it anyway. Then we watched it again. For some reason, this movie is amazingly addicting. The theory is that the actors relationships between one another and easy plot line make up for the not-so-special effects and the historical inaccuracies (though my girlfriend would argue with Joshua Koppe saying that most of ancient Christianity is based on Pagen theology so it makes it slightly more accurate). Newhart is phenomenal in his role (memo to self next time I want to call in the Marines) and Wyle/Flynn makes an amusing contradiction to the seriousness of surrounding characters.

Then, halfway through a project to build an exact one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid (including the long-missing golden capstone), his professor throws him out of the class with no comprehensible (to Flynn or the viewer) reason except that it's time for him to go out and experience life in the real world.  Less than 24 hours later, he receives a magical-seeming letter (somewhat reminiscent of Harry Potter's acceptance to Hogwarts) that tells him he's been invited to interview for ""a prestigious position at the Metropolitan Public Library.""  When he gets it, he learns to his amazement and delight that the Library is a lot more than just a repository for books: it's the latest incarnation of an institution whose history goes back to Alexandria, and among its treasures are wondrous and magical objects ranging from the Ark of the Covenant and Excalibur (how the sword was recovered from the mere is never explained), through a live unicorn and the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs, to a functioning jet-pack and H. G. Wells's original Time Machine.  And it has its enemies, including the ruthless Brotherhood of the Serpent, which longs to possess some of those treasures for the sake of the occult power they contain.  On Flynn's first day on the job, he finds that one of them--a piece of the Spear of Destiny, the weapon that pierced Jesus' side on the cross--has been stolen by a Serpent task force.  And it's up to him--geeky, clumsy Flynn--to get it back.  Why?  Because he's ""The Librarian.""  What follows is a chase from the Amazon Basin to the Himalayas and back to New York, infused with elements of Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Young Sherlock Holmes in about equal measure, and with the Serpents ever breathing down his neck.  Accompanying him as bodyguard is the gorgeous and deadly Nicole Noone, who blames herself for the supposed murder of Flynn's predecessor.  And Flynn, somewhat to his own amazement, proves more than equal to the challenge thanks to his broad store of esoteric knowledge.  (He discovers romance too).

Flynn is a charming character, and his improbable adventures are so well done that suspension of disbelief is very easy.  The movie was originally a TNT presentation and therefore, despite several hard-charging martial-arts sequences, no scarier than a Potter or Jones movie and suitable for all but the youngest and most sensitive children.  It may also inspire interest in some of the artifacts the Museum owns, and parents who buy it may find that they've inspired a Flynn of their own.

2303085,4,B0009NSCRQ,"So, this movie wasn't Indiana Jones. So what? What is? They did they best they could with a limited budget. So it had factual errors? So did Indiana Jones, so did the Mummy, so did National Treasure and Sahara. Does that make them less enjoyable movies? Not to me. So, give this movie a chance before you bash it.

This movie was superbly cast, given the TV movie budget. Noah Wylie was the geeky and goofy, but kinda cute, intellectual Flynn Carson, who finds himself in his thirties, living with his mother, while having amassed 22 degrees (is that even possible?) and is no longer welcome in school. He's told to get a job (and a life) and is  thrust into the real world. His well-meaning mother (Olympia Dukakis) is constantly trying to fix him up, in the mean time. So, here is Flynn, a genius with 22 degrees, and he doesn't have employers beating down his door with jobs? I took a star off for that being really inplausible.

Flynn finds an invitation to interview with the Metropolitan Libary. After waiting a whole day in line, he goes into an interview with cranky Jane Curtain, humorless director of library, although she was actually pretty funny. In a funny sequence, he deducts, with Sherlock Holmes logic, that she's recently divorced and had three different cats. Surprise, he meets a Judson, the senior librarian (Bob Newhart). They take him on a magical tour of the portion of the library that few people know about; it's stocked with antiquities that the rest of the world doesn't (or shouldn't) know about: the REAL Mona Lisa, the Holy Grail, unicorns, the golden goose, the arc of the covenant, pandora's box, among other things. The Librarians are keepers of these great treasures. And it's the Librarian's job to keep them secret from the public.

On Flynn's first official day, they discover that the library was broken into and a band of theives took only one thing: one-third of the Spear of Destiny, the spear that lanced Christ's side. To wield it gives the user great power. Hitler had a third. Napoleon had a third. So basically, humanity is SOL if the evil Serpend Brotherhood gets all three pieces. The only clues as to where the other three pieces are in in the Language of the Birds, which no living human being can translate- (of which, our hero does so in less than 6 hours). Thus, Flynn's on the job training begins.

Flynn finds himself on a flight to the Amazon while he steadily attempts to translate the language of the birds. Judson manages to come on Flynn's personal TV in coach, telling Flynn, ""Trust No One."" Unbeknownst to Flynn, the Serpent Brotherhood is on the plane, too! The horrors! A beautiful, but arrogant, Amazonian woman sits beside him, and eventually saves his hide (in a fantastic, yet unbelievable sort of way). When they escape to the jungle, she introduces herself as Nicole Noone (here's No One, get it!? Nyuck, Nyuck) and she has no interest in anything but keeping the Librarian alive. Thus, the adventure begins.

There was one romance scene, but really, most of it was just implied, not shown, so this movie is safe for the kiddies over the age of 8. There was great romantic tension between Flynn and Nicole. Wylie really flexed his comic muscle in this film (I never knew he had one). The best part, in my opinion, was when Bob Newhart got into a Ninja fight (you heard right!) with the Serpent Brotherhood (anybody else want a piece of me!?!). I laughed- Semper Fi!

2303091,3,B0009NSCRQ,"Noah Wylie is a young man with 22 degrees and is being forced into the real world.  He then received an invitation to interview at the Metropolitan Library.  Hidden in the depths of the library is the true Library.  Here as stored all the great knowledge and powerful artifact of the ages.  It has been locked away for millennia.  Wylie is offered the position of Librarian and he would be in charge of the collection.  But no sooner does he start than the Library's defenses are pierced and a piece of the Spear of Destiny has been stolen.

Wylie must go in the field and retrieve the remaining pieces and rescue the stolen one before its power can be used for evil.  Lots of action and silliness follow as Wylie tries to fulfill his job and his destiny.  Add an excellent supporting cast of Bob Newhart, Jane Curtin and Olympia Dukakis really help keep this show entertaining and fun.

But fun or not, this movie bears resemblance to Armageddon, the fun action picture that didn't make a lick of sense.  First we have Wylie have to find the remaining pieces of the spear instead of just rescuing the stolen one.  By finding the others, they just become vulnerable.  One an international flight the cockpit is open to visitors (there is an air marshal so we know the time frame).  A door on the plane is opened at cruising altitude and it doesn't depressurize (in fact passengers are shown to be completely unaware).  Cell phones apparently can work deep in the Amazon where there are no cell towers.  There is a Mayan pyramid a hundred times larger than anything they build and so tall it would have been seen from anywhere in the amazon.  The name of god has been lost for 4,000 years (and not just from the second destruction of the Great Temple in 70 AD).  Since the Spear is true, Christianity is true, but the Spear needs a Pagan ritual to put it back together (not bloody likely).  And more and more and more.  But like Armageddon the details don't matter.  Granted it would have been nice if they got some of them right but they didn't care about that.  If you like fun action films that have good characters and more than a hint of wit, then this one is for you.  If you can't stand plot inaccuracies, then stay away from this one.",1170028800,23,2241,4.452088452088452

I liked thehistorical references, but this film was SOOOOOOO unrealistic I was baffled that it was made at all, let alone shown on TNT.  I watched it cause of Noah Wyle and me loving his role on ER, but I tell you what.  The man cannot act.

It was about this guy who was a professional student and had somehow managed to get 22 degrees - 26, twenty something degrees and was only in his thirties.  Living with his mother.  Never had a date, girlfriend, etc.  His professor for some ancient Egyptian course he was taking kicked him out of school and told him he should start living life and enjoying it.....so he starts looking for a job.  Then magically he gets a blank card that words appear on and it's a job offer for a library.  Ooooooooohhhhhhh I was on the edge of my seat....

He gets there and there is a line for a position....the Librarian.  Why was that so exciting?  Beyond the fact that you get to take care of books?  Just kidding.....he was actually auditioning to be the keeper of some artifacts.  Which was awesome....Excalibur, a jet pack (?????where did that come in????), Pandoras Box, the Holy Grail, a Unicorn....you get the idea.  In addition to this, turns out the Librarian is the smartest person in the world (where else would all those degrees get you??) and the protector of the fate of the world.  Oh yes, the world.

Then he goes on some stupid adventure with this woman who wasn't that cute and long story short, saves the world from the Order of the Serpentine.  It was like...so dumb....I couldn't stop watching.....but wanted to shoot my foot because it would have been a distraction.

This is something like a modern day cross between ""Tomb Raider"" and the new ""Dr. Who"". The Librarian is not quite as physical as Indiana Jones, he uses his wits more to resolve problems, after all he was a professional student. However; there is still plenty of action and his guardian is not only lovely, she can kick the bad guys butts too. Good family entertainment and plenty of replayability. I suggest it as a purchase. I am anxiously awaiting my DVD to watch it again. This just recently came out on DVD. It is not well known movie and I think it may develop a bit of a movie cult status as it is unusual. This did not get alot of press and yet all my friends that I have talked to about it knew about it and thought it was great.

It stars Noah Wylie as Flynn, an overachieving eternal college student who knows too much for his own good.

Soon after he gets an invite to interview as librarian for the Metropolitan Library. But not just as a normal librarian. It's full of treasures from across the world, real and mythical. And the job turns into finding and defending them. He's soon romping across the world trying to find the Spear of Destiny, accompanied by Nicole, the Librarian's bodyguard, Sonya Walger.

Noah Wyle from ER is Flynn Carson, a perpetual college student (now thirty-two and with more than twenty degrees) finally forced to look for a job in the real world. He ends up not a librarian but The Librarian, in charge of a secret collection filled with the world's most valuable artifacts -- Pandora's Box, the Ark of the Covenant, Excalibur, the Holy Grail, the goose that laid the golden eggs, etc. (I guess they figured more viewers would understand ""librarian"" than ""curator."") The Bad Guys sneak in and steal one-third of the Spear of Destiny -- the Lance of Longinus -- the other two pieces of which are hidden away, one in a lost temple in the Amazon, the other in Shangri-La in the Himalayas. Flynn, naturally, must retrieve the other pieces and prevent their being rejoined by the Head Bad Guy. He's the brains, the brawn being supplied by Nicole Noone; she's supposed to be an example of perfect beauty but Sonya Walger just doesn't meet that requirement, sorry. It's a light-hearted romp with assorted plot-holes and not-believable stunts and a hero who just knows entirely too much about everything. (""I memorized the world,"" he says.)

Soon after Carsen is shown around the library by Judson, [Bob Newhart], the library is broken into by a crack team of evil doers. One third of the ""Spear of Destiny"", that was in the care of the library, is stolen. This is the spear that pierced Christ's side. This is a dangerous artifact. Hitler had a third. Napoleon had a third. Generally it's a bad thing in the wrong hands.

2303122,5,B0009NSCRQ,"This movie reminds me a lot of National Treasure.  It is a great movie for the whole family.  Noah Wylie did an excellent job.  Great plot, very interesting, quite enjoyable.  Would love to see a sequel!",1130025600,6,203,4.555555555555555
2303123,4,B0009NSCRQ,"What a funny movie - it takes every cliche from the Indiana Jones movies, plus a few others and packs them into one fast paced movie.  Don't watch this expecting to see what real librarians do - I've been one for over 20 years and have yet to have someone try and kill me.  Still, it's a lot of fun, lighthearted, and watching for the various ""old"" movie references can keep you on your toes.  Can you say ""Lost Horizon""?",1128988800,8,421,4.2375
2303124,5,B0009NSCRQ,"Ok-- I admit it, I'm biased, I'm a Librarian! Anyway, if you are a fan of Indiana Jones or old-time serials, and you can suspend disbelief, then have some fun and check out (pun intended) this light-hearted film about the ultimate library job.",1127952000,8,243,4.674418604651163
2303125,4,B0009NSCRQ,"I'm not a prude by any means, but in a world where SEX and SEX JOKES seems to be the ONLY creative thing to be seen on TV anymore, it is refreshing to see movies like NATIONAL TREASURE and this made for TV special.... LIBRARIAN-Spear of Destiny.

They are both a bit ""cheesey"" but are a much needed and refreshing wholesome break from the constant stagnation being seen in Hollywood and on TV today.

This is a ""made for the family"" type of movie .... sort of like a modernized Indiana Jones or Doc Savage for TV",1127520000,9,512,4.268041237113402
2303126,2,B0009NSCRQ,"""Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa,"" I should have known better but I bought it anyway. I simply couldn't help myself, I'm a sucker for anything dealing with the 'Spear of Destiny,' the legendary sword that pierced the side of Jesus as he hung on the cross.

How could I not have known it was going to be an inane comedy and not an exciting action/adventure a la Indiana Jones. Seeing the names of Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin listed among the cast on the back of the DVD case should have been a dead giveaway. I was a fool.

I can just imagine the conversation that must have taken place by the Hollywood 'Think Tank' that threw this one together. ""Hey, how about this super secret, top security library like the one at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Only ours will have more than just the Ark of the Covenant. We'll have Excalibur, Pandora's Box, the Golden Fleece, the Holy Grail, the Spear of Destiny, H.G. Wells' Time Machine, the Goose that laid the Golden Egg, etc...""

[Getting the picture?]

""Then we'll have this librarian who's in charge of preserving and protecting all this stuff from an ancient and sinister  cult like the 'Serpent Brotherhood' who want to steal the artifacts and rule the world. How about getting that Noah Wylie dude from 'E.R.', he's pretty popular with chicks right now and we'll need a couple of hottie's (Sonya Walger and Kelly Hu) to get the guys watching. It's sure to win the time slot!""

That's the 'Reader's Digest' version. Believe me when I tell you the extended, unedited version doesn't get any better. So, if you have one of those evening where you have absolutely nothing else to do, it's too early for bed and you just want to watch something silly and unchallenging, this is the movie for you!",1127088000,7,1736,4.5303514376996805
2303127,4,B0009NSCRQ,"This is not a great movie, but it is a movie that you can watch over and over again.  It has lots of action, some good comedy, some suspense and even some intellectual commentary.  In other words, something for everyone.  Bob Newhart is wonderful as the ""Head Librarian"", and all the other actors and actresses are very good.  For those who like this, there is even a catfight between two very very attractive ladies.  Yes, it's fun to watch.  No, it won't give you the secret of world peace, or end world hunger, or even pay your bills for you.",1126310400,4,545,4.4
