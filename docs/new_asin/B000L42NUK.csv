8160158,3,B000L42NUK,cannot comment on the quality but the songs were familiar to my father who grew up in the 1940's and thru 1960's performed some of these selections.,1375660800,,148,4.518518518518518
8160159,1,B000L42NUK,"Buyers should be aware that the operas here are mimed by the singers (all of them exceedingly badly), taken out of their original setting both making the whole thing look and sound like a bad Vegas Lounge Act. Most of the songs get a western make over as far as the orchestra is concerned in an attempt to make them more ""palatable"". The singers just rotate between songs and the backing dancers just change costume but the choreography is the same. Without the visuals this would have made a passable CD.",1351987200,,505,4.56043956043956
8160160,2,B000L42NUK,"Pieces of great performance, but without any introduction or explanation. Without subtitle, even a Chinese-speaker can barely understand what they're saying, so what are English speakers gonna do! Disappointing. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew.",1257638400,3,246,5.861111111111111
8160161,5,B000L42NUK,"Got this DVD as a part of B-day gift for my dad. He is a big Chinese opera fan. According to him, he loves this DVD because it gives him the best part of various operas.",1226275200,,169,3.7222222222222223
