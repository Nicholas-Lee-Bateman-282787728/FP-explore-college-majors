5993617,1,B00FJT1F7E,"This video does not burn that many calories! I guess I'm the sucker who bought into it! I'm 136lbs and burned aprox 200 calories.. I used a heart rate monitor gave 100%effort.  I can get my heart rate higher taking a power walk and burn more in that hour. I'm very dissapointed and wish I would have bought Zuzka or something with that intensity that I'm used to.  I know what it takes or feels like to work for 500 calories and this is not even near. even the reps aren't enough in this video.  The instructors are cute and great but thats not going to burn the calories for me I hate buying useless videos  grrrr.  If you are a beginner, maybe this will be okay.maybe.ballet beautiful,ballet body by Leah sarago especially will work you harder muscle wise if you want the ballet type workout.  cardio: catherine frederick,or Jeneatte Jenkins etc.
good luck",1382918400,,858,4.538961038961039
5993618,4,B00FJT1F7E,"I am a daily exerciser who occasionally dabbles in barre-style workouts.  I admit that I am somewhat picky about the barre workouts that I like, as I generally don't enjoy an over-emphasis on thigh exercises, all-fours moves, or c-curve abs work, all of which are frequently found in barre DVDs.  However, I DO like barre routines with a strong emphasis on working the glutes, and on researching Cardio Butt School, that is exactly what I expected from this workout.

Cardio Butt School features three instructors:  Karyn, who leads the first half; Sam, who leads the second half; and Ashley, who serves as a background exerciser only.  The Pop Physique ""schtick"" is a high energy style workout in which the instructors are shown wearing retro-type costumes; in Cardio Butt School, all three are wearing brightly colored leotards with leg warmers.  This routine requires a set of hand weights (they use 2 lbs.), a mat, and a chair.  The Main Menu offers an option for ""Play"" only, and there is no chaptering.  I have broken down the workout below.

Karyn starts the workout with an extremely brief warm-up consisting of full-body swings and wide plie squats.  Moving quickly, she comes down to the floor in a plank position for several exercises, including fast plank twists (knee to opposite elbow), knee ins (from an elevated 3-foot table position), and push-ups on the knees (including pulses).  Flipping over, she performs reverse plank, including a 1-legged version.  Next, Karyn picks up the hand weights, and coming into a v-sit position, she does fast bicep curls.  Still holding the weights, she lies back and performs flies with leg raises.  Following a brief down dog stretch, Karyn comes to standing for several more arms exercises in a demi-plie position, including a front arm raise, an arm push, and press backs.  She then moves into a rear triceps press with one leg balance and arm push behind.  Karyn concludes the arms work in a wide plie stance for ballet arms open/closed, and she finishes with a brief stretch.

At this point (about 11.5 minutes into the workout), I am starting to wonder, where's the butt work?  I think it's coming, as Karyn and crew get out the chairs, but no, she states that now we're moving on to thigh work.  She begins in first position facing the chair (using the chair for balance only), performing releves, dips, knee push backs, and pelvis forward and back.  The next position is with the feet together and parallel for pulses up and down and to each side.  The final position was a bit different:  standing away from the chair with the feet in first position and the back rounded.  From here, Karyn cues dips but also leg lifts to the front.

Turning so that the chair is to her side, Karyn FINALLY does some seat moves, including grande battements and arabesques; she follows this with a quick quad stretch.  Then (at 18.5 minutes), Sam takes over the instruction, continuing with the seat work.  From a rear arabesque position, she performs lifts, pulses in, and an L-shaped move; she finishes with lifts from a standing split position.  This concludes the standing butt work, and Sam transitions to the floor to perform a Figure 4 stretch.

Abs work comes next.  The abs work (about 5.5 minutes) is performed from a v-sit position, made a bit more awkward by having your toes on the floor, heels up.  Moves include dropping the abdominals, twisting to the side, sliding the toes in/out, and dropping the torso to the side while lifting a leg.  Following the abs section, Sam moves into some additional glutes work from a side-lying position; this segment was similar to the Pilates leg kicks series.  Sam begins with front/back leg kicks, and then bending the knees in and elevating the feet, she performs hamstring presses.  After repeating on the other side, she lies prone for single leg lifts (in, up, and the L-shape), and she finishes with quick superman-type lifts, the last exercise of the workout.

At the 35-minute mark, Sam begins the final stretch, moving quickly through 1-legged seated forward bend, pigeon, and half lord of the fishes twist on each side and then concluding with double seated forward bend.  The total time for this workout comes in right around 39 minutes.

If you are looking for a full-body, high-energy barre-style workout at an intermediate level, this might fit the bill for you.  Personally, however, I was disappointed.  By my count, this routine spent only about 10 minutes total time focused on the glutes--definitely NOT what I expected from a DVD entitled ""Cardio Butt School""!  In that sense, Pop Physique, while a nice production, is really not all that different from other barre-type workouts available, so I'd recommend that you purchase only with that in mind.",1358899200,23,4764,4.878109452736318
5993619,5,B00FJT1F7E,This is a great strengthen and stretch workout with some cardio too.  I enjoyed this live class and they don't have it where I live so I am happy to have the DVD's.,1357430400,,164,3.9696969696969697
5993620,5,B00FJT1F7E,"As mentioned in the title, I did not like it at first; however, after working-out to it a few times, I love it! I had to get used to their ""Barre"" style workout! It flows well, and just when you think this isn't translating into a burn, it does! It's the small precise moves that make the difference. It is fantastic!",1354320000,,317,4.213114754098361
5993621,5,B00FJT1F7E,"I like this routine because it is a 40 min total body sculpt! Karen leads the first 20 mins, then Sam takes over for the next 20 mins.

5993622,4,B00FJT1F7E,This is a very good DVD.  I took one class at their studio and found it challenging but difficult to get there and expensive.  This is a great alternative.  Inexpensive DVD that delivers close to what you can get in an actual class.  I do not believe that this burns 500 calories in the 39 minute workout but probably a good 250 calories.  Definitely recommend!,1338768000,2,361,4.492307692307692

The energy level of the girls in the DVD mimic that of class, which makes it easy for me to stay focused, like in class.
