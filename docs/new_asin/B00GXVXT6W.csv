6123811,3,B00GXVXT6W,"The focus of Silvio Soldinis flim Garibaldis Lovers is spread quite widely, as the story set in Italy, follows an assortment of interesting characters, through events in their everyday lives.

Initially it seems that Diana (Alba Rohrwacher), a struggling artist, will be the central figure, but matters soon expand to include Leo (Valerio Mastandrea) a plumber, and his son Elia (Luca Dirodi), daughter Maddalena (Serena Pintucci), and the ghost of his dead wife Teresa (Claudia Gerini).  Also involved is Dianas oddball landlord Amanzio (Giuseppe Battiston), a slick lawyer named Malaffano (Luca Zingaretti), a stork named Agostina, and a statue of Italian soldier and statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), who
provides commentary about events of the day.

The narrative flows along with a light breezy tone, with events mostly related to the activities of the shady Malaffano.  These include the painting of a mural, the purchase of a house, the removal of an embarrassing video, and a new romance for Maddalena.  Things never get too heavy or dramatic, as the film concludes with Leos frantic search for his son.

The movie is well shot, and features some interesting cinematography, including a hyped-up bike ride through the city.  The acting performances are very enjoyable.  Alba Rohrwasher is particularly delightful, but unfortunately isn't featured more.  While Garibaldis Lovers can certainly be appreciated by those with no knowledge of Italian life or history, perhaps those with some insight into the culture, might better appreciate the nuances and messages in the film.

As usual, this Film Movement release also includes a short.  The Kiosk is an amusing animated feature, about the operator of a kiosk, who dreams of a more exciting life.

Garibaldi's Lovers is from Italian director Silvio Soldini.  As with all Film Movement releases, it is an official selection or winner at multiple film festivals.

Soldini opens the film with a series of statues in an unnamed Italian park conversing on the current state of things. (One of them is Garabaldi - I stopped to go look this up - he  considered to be one of  Italy's ""fathers of the fatherland"".)

From Soldini's liner notes:

""...the idea of giving a voice to the statues that have been in our streets and parks for centuries. While we may not even know who they are or what they represent, perhaps they might have something to say to us with respect to where our country is headed.""

These statues are given the stage many times to share their thoughts and bicker amongst themselves.

We meet  Diana, an artist (Alba Rohrwacher) who is behind on her rent and is desperately trying to collect money owed to her. Leo (Valerio Mastandrea) is a widowed plumber trying to raise his two children - Elia and Maddalena.

Garibaldi's Lovers is a busy film. There are many players and plot lines - Amanzio (Giuseppe Battiston) , an oddball landlord determined to educate the public, Elia's fascination with a stork, Maddlena's fascination with boys, a crooked lawyer, the plumber's assistant whose wife is sure he is cheating and Leo's dead wife (although it took me a scene or two to realize she was dead) Each of these characters is used as a vehicle for social commentary. Soldini manages to serendipitously weave them all the various plot lines together by the end. (although there a few loose ends).

Soldini provides a light touch in addition to the social commentary through whimsical touches and almost slapstick situations. The apartments of all the characters are filled with colour and oddities that capture the eye. There is oompah circus style music in the beginning of the film as well. I did laugh out loud at Diana's mural for the lawyer. I quickly grew tired of the plumbing assistant yelling down the phone at his wife.

Soldini uses a pinhole closing to certain scenes to be sure that our attention is on that moment. There is a lot of symbolism used throughout the film - the stork being the most obvious.

I am really enjoying sampling what Film Movement has to offer and experiencing films from other countries.  However, Garibaldi's Lovers is probably my least favourite so far. No, don't get me wrong - it's good. The acting is solid and the plot involving the 'real' people was captivating. The statues and their commentary just didn't work for me. I was able to easily walk away and return the next day to finish watching.

I always enjoy reading the bios of the actors at the end of the film. I was disappointed to find that only the director and Alba Rohrwacher included. I would have liked to read more about the other actors as well - especially Valerio Mastandrea - I thought he was wonderful.

As always, there's a small short included with the DVD. The Kiosk is an animated short from Switzerland. A kiosk lady finds herself too large to leave her stand, yet dreams of travelling. A bit sad, but with a sweet little ending.",1390608000,,3166,4.6859205776173285
6123813,5,B00GXVXT6W,"Director Silvio Soldini produces a film of magic, wishes and human nature. The films begin in the central square of a modern city in Italy where statues of famous past heroes (Garibaldi being one) speak to each other about the sad condition of the modern world. It's a magical fun motif throughout the film.

Leo is a plumber who is recently widowed and has two teenage children (son Elia, who befriends a stork and a rambunctious, Maddalena) who keep him busy as a father - both parentally and monetarily. Leo's spirit-wife unexpectedly appears to help Leo through difficult periods. Diana is a starving artist who is badly treated by her landlord who is involved with crooked attorneys who are scheming to make money on illegal real estate plans. It is there that the heroines Leo and Diana meet; him doing a deal for the attorney and her painting a mural for the office. Other characters include a hired `spy' that infiltrates Leo and Diana's life and an older, cynical man who befriends Elia.

The film is a constant mix of humor, absurdity, love, commitment and a constantly twisting plot. The scenes with the statues that seemingly speak to each other tell the viewer that although this is a real life story with consequences, it is told with great warmth and humor. Leo's relationship with Diana is brilliant, but the ending with Leo's spirit-wife will leave you smiling.

Also on this DVD is a humorous short film called, ""The Kiosk"". It's a European `South Park' basic style of a cartoon about a woman who works in a magazine kiosk and eats. She eats so much that she ends up getting stuck in the kiosk. She lives and moves about town in that little kiosk. It views like a child's storybook. It's slightly humorous, if you can get over how some might find obesity not a funny matter.",1390608000,,1792,4.6645569620253164
6123814,5,B00GXVXT6W,"Take an overworked widower plumber, his two detached yet devoted teenage kids, a starving artist, her work-averse tenant and his broke starving artist tenant. Add a scamming lawyer, a Chinese-Italian guy whose wife is convinced he's having an affair (even though he his not), a wayward stork, a viral video and the ghost of the plumber's wife. Season with Milanese statues of famous Italians commenting on each others' foibles as they decry the state of modern culture.

This is a strange mix that starts slowly, but melds together in a finely woven tale that is variously funny, sweet and sad. To say anything else would spoil a marvelous movie that will leave you feeling better than any formulaic romcom that Hollywood can dish.

If you want an excellent change of pace pace with intriguing characters and an ambitious storyline and surprising outcomes, watch this movie.

Finally, be on the lookout for the clocks that show it's 4:02!

6123815,4,B00GXVXT6W,"Garibaldi's Lovers is an odd mixture of people who lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways. The characters are well defined and most of them are very likable. The plot has been reiterated a number of times so I won't repeat that. I really liked the character of Elia, who even though portrayed as a 'bad kid' in the beginning, is just trying to do the right thing. His relationship with the stork Augustina is very sweet. Elia's dad, Leo, is just trying to make a living and keep his family together, relying on his late night conversations with the ghost of his coffee sniffing wife to stay on track and work things through. This is not a 'family' movie as there is detailed discussion of a sexual act and its upload to the internet.

I really liked the depth of the relationships, especially Leo and his kids. They never give up on each other. The statues talking was a great way to add some humor and unique perspective to the storyline.

I thought it did slow a bit at times but it kept me interested enough especially as the end approached and the tension mounted.",1390262400,,1073,4.469387755102041
6123816,5,B00GXVXT6W,"This is the latest from director Silvio Soldini who also brought us the rather good Come Undone.  It is an unusual mix of ideas that somehow works. We meet widower and plumber Leo who is struggling with his teenage children, his son Elia and feisty daughter, Maddalena. He is partially helped in this by the ghost of his dead wife  whom only he can see.

His path crosses with that of a nasty, corrupt lawyer Malaffano  played brilliantly by Luca Zingaretti (Inspector Montalbano and Cefalonia) who has employed a broke and struggling artist  Diana to paint a mural in his office. Leo sort of falls for her. Meanwhile his son has met an older man who he sort of befriends  Elia also has a relationship with a stork which he is prepared to steal food for. Add to the mix the Garibadi in the title in the form of a statue that adds a running commentary to the proceedings as well as entering into political discourse with other statues and you have a very unusual film indeed.

This is a commentary on modern life and can be seen as satirical and critical in part. It is also a story about how people interact and what we are capable of  both very good deeds and very dark ones. It is, as I have mentioned unusual, but it is also very entertaining, very well made  all the acting is superb and it has a stylish lan which I love with Italian cinema. It is in Italian with a smattering of a few other languages thrown in and has very good subtitles. I received a review copy from Film Movement and as ever this presentation comes with a bonus short film called The Kiosk a rather sweet little film.  This is both funny and touching and is one of those films that you will get more from on a subsequent viewing  I can absolutely recommend.",1389398400,,1734,4.354037267080745
6123817,4,B00GXVXT6W,"This Italian film with English subtitles is named with reference to one of the founders of modern Italy, whose heroic statue in the middle of the city of Genoa makes an ironic contrast with the desperate lives chronicled with deft and dark humor.  The two principle characters are a struggling young artist who can't get payment or appreciation for her work, and a widowed plumber who is struggling to raise two teenagers.  There are a host of minor characters, including the two teenagers and a sinister but amusing fellow who may or may not be the young artist's landlord.

The characters spend their time bouncing off each other in a series of coincidences that eventually lead to friendship (and apparently the beginnings of love.) The pace tends to be frenetic, and there's a lot of social commentary on governmental and business corruption, mixed with some funny situations that could almost be called slapstick. At the end the story line remains somewhat disparate and confusing (though this may well be because I'm not familiar with Italian), but I did get a pretty strong idea of how frenetic and sometimes frustrating modern Italian life can be.",1388102400,,1155,4.943298969072165
6123818,5,B00GXVXT6W,"Silvio Soldini (Bread and Tulips, Days  and Clouds, Come Undone) has done it again - made a film that restores faith in the little man and the little woman in their plights to race for dreams. Writing with Doriana Leondeff and Marco Pettenello he has give us a story the bubbles like Asti Spumante and while being hilariously funny it brims over with genuine sentiment.

The title comes from Soldini's focus on the statue of Garibaldi in the central square of Genoa, Italy - a statue whose voice (courtesy of Pierfrancesco Favino) commiserates with the statue of Cazzaniga (voiced by Gigio Alberti) about the sad state of affairs and corruption in Italy and the discussion is played out by the antics of the people of the streets below them. Leo (Valerio Mastancrea) is a widowed plumber (his deceased wife Teresa - Claudia Gerini - appears to him as a 3-dimensional ghost who misses her family and urges Leo to find a new woman) who struggles to support his two children  - Maddalena (Serena Pintucci), who is horrified when she discovers that her boyfriend has videotaped her en flagrante and placed it on the internet, and her younger brother, nerdy Elia who spends his time feeding and talking to a stork named Agostina. Concurrently we meet shady lawyers Malaffano (Luca Zingaretti) who cheat honest people, a `landlord' Amanzio (Giuseppe Battiston who illegally demands rent, especially from a starving artist Diana (Alba Rohrwacher) who in turn agrees to paint a mural for Malaffano and there meets Leo who is agreeing to `do a deal' for the lawyer by providing a signature on an illegal house purchase in order to make enough money to defend his daughter's case against the boy who placed the sex tape on the internet. To top it off Amanzio becomes friends with Elia and when Elia's stork Agostina goes missing, agrees to drive Elia to Switzerland to find her. Meanwhile Leo and Diana have bonded, Diana has a new boyfriend Emiliano (Michele Maganza) who turns out to be spying, and everything spins to a peculiar but satisfying end.

Soldini's little stories make significant comments on the problems of life at the present time - not only with people but with the corruption of the cities. He peppers his script with many quotations from famous people of history, a factor that adds a dimension of dignity to this wonderful bit of charming lighthearted comedy. Highly recommended.

6123824,2,B00GXVXT6W,"I LOVE Silvio Soldino's Bread & Tulips and I want to see all the rest of his movies.  So far, I've only really liked Bread & Tulips.  This one, Garibaldi's Lovers, has nothing to do with Garibaldi, someone named Garibaldi, or Lovers or someone named Lovers.  It is a slow movie.  It has quirky characters, as did Bread & Tulips, but these characters are not endearing.  You're not going to laugh and be happy because two people fell in love at the end of the movie.

I found that I didn't have to read the subtitles after a while, which is nice. My Italian is better than I thought - or the dialogue is particularly good for the action and meaning in the scenes. It was fun to see Milan from above, and neighborhoods of the city I would not normally visit.
