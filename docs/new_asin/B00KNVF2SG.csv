6435124,4,B00KNVF2SG,"There is nothing like a Steven Seagal film except another Steven Seagal film. In this film Seagal introduces himself through some philosophical dialogue to let us know how deep and complex he is, unlike his movies. He plays Alexander, the ""White Ghost"" a mercenary out to kill arms dealer Chen (Tzi Ma). After an unsuccessful attempt in ""Dagestan,"" Seagal is in an unnamed Eastern European nation (Bucharest, Romania) living next door to a beautiful girl Lena (Iulia Verdes) who happens to be the sister of Russian mafia strong arm collector (Victor Webster). Seagal lives a low key life as the building super by day.... Bodies of the Russian mafia litter the street with limbs cut off and oriental symbols drawn by them...Oh who could be doing that?

The plot is straight forward, except for that one thing we see coming. Seagal goes after the bad guys while attempting to save the girl and her sister too. Grindhouse style action, music, and fast speed fighting for Seagal. Some scenes are poorly dubbed, others use English subtitles when they speak English for emphasis (?) and sometimes they speak Russian with no subtitles. They shouldn't allow drinking in the editing room.

4 stars on the Seagal scale.

6435127,4,B00KNVF2SG,"AS an action movie,, rates at least 3-star or better,,  IF you are Steven Seagal fan,,, more of a FOUR Star rating,,, better than average story decently portrayed... Step ahead for Seagal compared to some of his films,,,  davzway

ps: most of his films would get at least 3 Star rating,, though I cannot remember one that would be a five star.
pps:  For some of the nay sayers,,, in real life Steven Seagal can SHOOT,, usually seen with 1911 pistol in 45acp caliber,,, if you know gun handling,, and times when director hasa  reload with new magazine instead of firing nonstop (std 1911 can hold 8 rounds, nine if one in barrel with fully loaded mag,,, yeah there are some DOUBLE stack 1911 with 12 round mags,, but grip is FAT and would be noticeable... Seagal handles a 1911 like someone who has fired many rounds,,, mag changes are near flawless even if movie...

ppps: remember it's a movie,, from Hollywood,,,, director decides what  happens.. real life no reshoots if something goes wrong.. etc..",1498176000,,1002,4.691428571428571
6435128,5,B00KNVF2SG,"Segal fans of the 90s will be pleased! It's been a while since a Segal movie looked this good. I own many of the movies he's in and enjoy almost all of them, but I'm glad to see a little more care and attention in the production of this one. The story isn't anything new, but it's intriguing and entertaining. The action scenes deliver vintage Segal days of the past with a modern take. Very well done! The characters are all great and play their parts well. The audio is great, and the video quality is superb for a DVD. Overall, if you are a Segal fan, or an action fan in general, you will like this film.",1496188800,2,608,4.161016949152542

This is part of the product description. It is fairly accurate too. I can't believe that I actually liked one of Steven Seagal's movies because he is an awful actor and the plots are usually awful, too. What is this thing with him wearing a coat and scarf through the whole movie, we get that he got heavy, no need to wear all that, he looked like he was baking. The violence level is fine, tons of it.

I am aghast, i did chuckle though and it was good to see some new talent...but Steven can we get something for the swelling of your head, it looks painful man..the Goati looks like it was made by the same person that made the incredibly bad hair thing ..attachment..stick on fuzzy wuzzy...dead bear cub, beaver tail, muskrat pubic hair, somebody help me here...ummm..thick wig ....wigwam..toupee...hair weave...unit...hair replacement...United states Army Camowigflage...Special Ops Wiggy bang bang..

Steven the hair needs to breathe Hancho...it's too tight against the scalp causing you to slur your speech .....Call my friend Phil he has a guy who knows a guy that can help you out.you need not to get too attached the the ""Thick Flat Wig"" style ..perhaps give your current hair dresser a Mai Kiagi to the groin...bam

Anyway Steve I was onboard with the bad movie, and everything was cool in my world, then that scene at the end when you ..love that poor woman from Bucharest in your leathers...I did get a peak at some grey hairs ...again you need to go ""spec ops"" on the hairdresser ...seriously I am scarred from Steven's love scenes..the martial arts are bad enough but why punish me ....It was a weird scene...i would have given you a solid two...but you jumped the shark there bro...",1459814400,,1520,4.861003861003861

6435203,2,B00KNVF2SG,"Steven Seagal is obviously past his prime.  He is overweight, bloated, and cannot do the martial arts that he was famous for.  As a matter of fact, and very embarrassing, the second male lead does all of the kung fu stuff that Steven was famous for.  The only thing Steven is good for is his dead pan look -- never smile -- fatalistic approach to all of his recent characters that some people (those who give it 4 or 5 Stars) have come to love.

Proof in the pudding:  The very last scene, when he is with the girl.  She takes off her top and straddles him.  She has a big loving smile, and look at his face:  Have you ever seen an actor so (unintentionally) uncomfortable in your life?  The look on his face is: ""For god sake, someone please yell cut!""

Yeah, he's way past his prime.",1422230400,,785,4.208053691275167

I won't give any spoilers, just in the unlikely event you are interested in the plot of any of Seagal's films and can't, in the first 10 minutes, figure out exactly who the bad guys are, who the good guys are, and what's gonna happen for the next 90 minutes...",1416528000,2,486,4.47191011235955

Not until Urban Justice came along were we given a faint glimmer of hope his films would start getting better.  That didn't happen exactly, though some of them were more bearable.  So it was with my usual caution and apprehension that I dared watch A Good Man, not expecting much...and being shocked at how GOOD it is.  If you, too, are a Seagal fan familiar with his DTV body of work, you know what the usual problems are, and none of them are present to mar this film.  Not only that, be Sensei Segal actually seemed to put more gusto into this performance.  I don't know what happened, but I hope it keeps happening now.  It's taken ten years, but he has finally produced a 'real' movie again.  This is, by far, his best DTV movie, surpassing even the aforementioned Urban Justice.  I will watch this one many times.

The supporting smaller roles and the ladies were very believable. The characters had depth, the storyline was believable and the actors were very well cast, they had great chemistry together and were very cinematic. He put together a good group of talent. This movie really moved, there was a great storyline between him and the Russian bartenderess, the ending scene was tastefully shot and on the whole, the movie was a different Seagal film in many aspects then we are used to seeing, with higher value production quality.

Now that you know that up front I can honestly say this is truly a good movie. The script is definitely one of the best for any of his films. The supporting cast also does a good job in the acting department. The main reason for watching a Steven Seagal film is the action sequences and this film has plenty of them. Costar Albert Webster does plenty to raise the level of this film both acting and his own fight sequences.

6435250,3,B00KNVF2SG,"THE FILM: Steven Seagal returns to the screen in this story about a former black ops warrior who gets caught in between Russian and Chinese gangs in order to save the sister of his neighbor, whose brother is in debt to the Russian mob. Truth be told, while one could call this a Steven Seagal movie, his character occupies a position that simultaneously is and isn't the center of the story (much like his previous effort FORCE OF EXECUTION). However, unlike FORCE OF EXECUTION, the story is better, more thought out and has better action sequences. Even the acting is better this time around, which is a plus. Story-wise, Seagal plays a variation on the character he plays in almost every movie he makes: that of the reluctant hero. He puts himself into a self-imposed retirement after a terrorist hit goes wrong, and a young girl dies while one of the bad guys gets away. Cut to the present day, and he's living a quiet life in Eastern Europe. His neighbor (Iulia Verdes) works at a strip bar (but she's just a bartender) run by the Russian mob while her half-brother (Victor Webster) pays off a debt owed by his father. However, when some men are killed and money meant for the Chinese mob goes missing, the neighbor's little sister is kidnapped and Alexander (Seagal) goes back into action. I thought that the story, while nothing original at all, was at least executed rather well within the confines of what constitutes a Seagal movie. The performances were also decent for this type of movie, with Tzi Ma probably doing the best out of the cast. Also of note is the improved fight sequences, which aren't completely edited to hell this time. The camerawork still has a handheld feel to it, but the action is more comprehensible than a lot of Seagal's recent DTV output and you can tell that it's him a lot more of the time. They also varied the types of fighting. Sure, they had the typical gunplay and close quarters hand-to-hand combat, but Seagal got to use a short sword for several scenes which was a nice change of pace (and provided some gruesome kills). Still, as always it wasn't all great. This movie was filmed on the cheap in Romania and it shows in the bleak cinematography and sparse sets. There was also some digital augmentation in a few scenes that stuck out pretty badly, and a couple of obvious uses of stock footage that wasn't at the same quality as the movie itself. And while some might count this as a positive, there was a bunch of gratuitous nudity which was only in there because some scenes happened to take place in a bar. There's also an awkward ""sex"" scene with Steven Seagal and Iulia Verdes which could have been left out completely. When all is said and done, Seagal fans should be pleased, as this is a return to form of sorts, at least when limited to his DTV work. As always, though, everyone else should probably find something else to watch.

THE EXTRAS: There is a 15-minute behind-the-scenes featurette which, while not particularly insightful, was nice enough because it allowed the cast and crew to talk about the experience. One fact that intrigued me, but that makes complete sense upon hearing it, is that this movie started out as a sequel to FORCE OF EXECUTION. That would explain why Seagal's characters have the same name, and the similarity in the way they look. Beyond that, there are a handful of trailers, including the trailer for the main feature.

OVERALL: It's not the best DTV Seagal movie, but it improves over its predecessor in terms of story and action. There is also a single bonus feature that provides limited insight into the production, and supplements the main feature quite nicely.

6435262,1,B00KNVF2SG,"Avoid this movie.

I've watched all of the older Seagal movies. I rewatch Under Siege 1 & 2 every now and then for the nostalgia and the funny banter that goes on. This movie is something I could not get through. I watched the first 10 minutes and decided to turn it off. With as many movies being made these days, most that are awfully written/acted I'll give a movie 10 minutes before I call it quits and not waste my time. I understand Seagal is old. I had to look up on Wiki that he is now 62. 62 and still trying to do action movies. I love you Steven Seagal, however it's time to put a fork in your action acting career.

I said spoilers in the title. Do not read anymore if you don't want to be spoiled....

I didn't pay attention to the characters names so bear with me.

The first scene of the movie is Seagal and another guy trekking through a forest to kill some terrorists holed up with some hostages. They have a UAV (drone) overhead to help them with support. They find the building with the terrorists and Seagal goes in alone while the other guy provides cover fire if needed. The first bad guy Seagal encounters gets beaten up with punches and high kicks. You can tell it's edited out so the stunt man or double or whatever you want to call him does all the kicking and punching. It cuts back to Seagal clearing additional rooms. Seagal kills more bad guys and the blood splatter it shows is CGI meaning it's not even real blood splatter (with fake blood of course), it's computer graphics which is bothersome.

He finds the main room with the hostages and terrorists and blows the door open, haphazardly fires his machine gun into the building, hitting only terrorists of course and the bad guys exit through a back door and get into a jeep. He tells the drone pilot not to fire any missiles since the terrorists aren't in the building anymore and there's women and children in the building. Of course the drone pilot says OOPS I just fired it (not literally) and it shows some kind of stock footage of a missile traveling. Keep in mind the drone is DIRECTLY overhead and looks like it's about 300 feet in the air. You could drop a baseball from that distance and it would only take a few seconds to  hit the ground. The stock footage of the missile is ridiculous. It looks like it's going 600MPH and traveling half a mile. From the time the pilot said the missile was away to the time it hit the building, Seagal had time to go into the doorway, tell a little girl to go with him (and awful acting. he was so calm like he wasn't about to be obliterated by a missile) and run out of the house and make it about 30-50 feet before the missile hit the house and blew it up. When the missile hit the house and it showed the characters getting blown forward, as is usual Hollywood protocol, it reminded me of a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode when Will was at the gym trying to get buff and a female throws him across the gym. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the ""dummies"" that are supposed to be the girl and Seagal looked like they were dummies instead of having any weight or anything on them; arms flailing and what not. Seagal survives, the little girl did not.

After that I gave up. I wasn't going to waste 90 minutes on finishing the rest of the movie. I wish I didn't write this review but it was so awful I felt a need to warn you not to waste your time as I have wasted mine. As a bonus, fast forwarded to the end of the movie just to see what the ending was like. There's an Asian man with a little girl hostage in a nice room. Looks like an office. Seagal being the man that he is persuades the guy to let the girl go and they can fight each other with swords. The Asian man takes a sword off of his desk and Seagal has his own and I thought it was going to be an awesome sword fight. NOPE. They each move forward and with ONE slice Seagal kills the guy. No back and forth with swords clattering, just one slice. I guess that's all poor 62 year old Seagal could take.

I'm sure Seagal made the movie just to get some money. This movies takes Hollywood exaggerations to the next level. This movie is bottom of the $5 bin at Walmart, This movie is an F-, zero point zero, thumbs down, whatever else is the worst when it comes to critiquing.

He has made some very good movies, but this was not one of them.  The story line was all over the place.  At times it was difficult to work out who was who and what they were supposed to be doing and the sub standard acting did nothing to help.
There were a couple of reasonably well staged fight scenes, but a couple of fight scenes do not make a good movie all by themselves.
So, was Mr. Seagal ""a good man""?  Certainly when he was in his prime, but those days, sadly, are long gone.

Additional action is provided by his co-star in this film, and it is GREAT!  Keep in mind Seagal is a martial artist first, then an actor. No one has ever accused him of threatening top post actors with his acting skills. But then, that is not what his fans are looking for.

6435275,5,B00KNVF2SG,"You know all those films you've suffered through, that were action films, but didn't have enough fighting? And even the fights that got stuck in there weren't really satisfying? This movie will make up for all those movies. You will watch the credits roll at the end, and just lay there feeling totally satisfied, maybe even have a cigarette afterwards. There's that much GOOD fighting! We get served a steady stream of ingenious fights, short ones, long ones, with all sorts of styles and weapon combinations thrown in, barely interrupted by plot, which is as it should be. I haven't enjoyed a fighting film this much since the Bruce Lee movies, which I own, and this reminds me of. Hand-to-hand, hand-to-gun, hand-to-sword, gun-to-sword, sword-to-sword, hand-to-chain, pipe-to-pipe, pipe-to-chain, are only some of the cool fighting combinations used. Other incidental weapons include chairs, a phone, a stripper pole, a bottle, a door.. I forgot what else. Finally a movie gets the perfect balance of simple plot, simple characters, and TONS of fighting that made movies like Enter The Dragon great. (And this has even more fighting than that.) I'm adding this to my collection.

Seagal splits the screen-time fighting with Victor Webster about 50/50. So Webster has some of the coolest fights, but he carries it nicely. Wouldn't mind seeing some martial arts movies starring just him.

Rating notes: Intense violence, frequent homicides, some torture. Moderate F-bombs. Topless nudity. No actual sex. A cute child and a dog add to the family appeal, but unusually graphic violence may limit audience to adults and some teens.",1409529600,6,1629,5.190114068441065

I can see him espousing his odd political philosophies on television, I can go see him playing the blues in concert, and finally, I can properly enjoy his movies again. Steven's film output for the last seven years has been uneven: for every&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;getting my hopes up, there was an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-the-Dark/dp/B001MLZNKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against the Dark</a>&nbsp;knocking `em back down again, but things seem to be leveling out now. For the longest time, I wasn't happy that Keoni Waxman had become Seagal's apparent director of choice, but their experience together is now paying off in their having made two back-to-back action vehicles that I really enjoy. ""A Good Man"" is a lot like the Seagal/Waxman collaboration that came before it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Force-of-Execution/dp/B00FEHCPZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Force of Execution</a>, and if you weren't a fan of that one, there's a good chance you won't like this one...but personally, I had a great time with it.

The story: an ex-Special Forces soldier (Seagal) on a quest of vengeance in Bucharest becomes caught up in a splintered family's troubles with the Russian and Chinese mafia.

Part of the reason for the upturn in quality of Seagal's movies is his opportunity/willingness to work alongside performers who can properly bolster his pictures. Recently, these have included Steve Austin, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, and Bren Foster, and now, he's got top character actor Tzi Ma (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Hour-series/dp/B004H83IOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush Hour series</a>) and martial arts stud Victor Webster (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mutant-X/dp/B00062IZS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mutant X</a>) on his side. Ironically, one of the biggest overall weaknesses of the film is its dramatic content, with way too many European performers phonetically delivering English dialogue, but Ma and Webster soundly anchor the movie as actors. They even have good chemistry with Seagal, who rumbles his lines but nonetheless seems pretty enthusiastic to be delivering some pompously cool phrases (e.g. ""Is this how you want to go out? A man of war, a son of Guang Gong, like this? Killing a child? This is not you"").

Waxman's screenplay is at least a step above the average for the direct-to-video realm. There's a bit too much backstory for me and one of those uncomfortable endings that seem to indulge the lead star more than it furthers the story, but there's also some definite intrigue and noticeable character development. I like that it fully establishes most of its main stars before plunging them into action, and as such, the film takes its time getting to the brunt of its adrenaline scenes. Additionally, the production values are pretty nice. There are very few ""avid farts"" (as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vern/dp/0857687220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vern</a>&nbsp;would call them) and none of the technical failures you tend to get with lower-budget flicks. What's most apparent for longtime fans is Seagal's minimal reliance on stunt doubles and stand-ins. Though there is some apparent doubling in one of Steven's fights, I think that this film marks the first time in many years that we can be certain we're seeing the back of the real Steven Seagal's head, not that of a hastily-inserted double. It's a weird thing to celebrate, but the cinematography benefits from Seagal apparently being on the set more and appearing in a lot of the second unit shots.

Equally or more important than any of that is, of course, the action content. In short, I was very pleased with what I saw. Seagal's last film boasted no less than ten full fight scenes, and ""A Good Man"" is close behind with nine, not counting the quick skirmishes. Steven claims four of these brawls and Victor Webster takes five. Seagal isn't slouching: despite the unwelcome presence of a double in one of the battles, he's in swell form and delivers quick, brutal martial arts, unhampered by excess editing. He regularly draws a short sword. And like Bren Foster one movie ago, Victor Webster claims the more elaborate fights, but I think Webster's style of fighting is better suited to a Steven Seagal feature than Bren's: he's a fighter, not an acrobat, and as a result, his brawls are more gritty and less pretty...though they're still a lot of fun and he still finds time to wield a couple melee weapons.

I'm not sure whether or not the ""Alexander"" that Seagal plays here is the same he played in ""Force of Execution,"" but if this persona helps generate this strong of an action movie, I'll be hoping for a trilogy. Like I said before, what I value in a Seagal flick doesn't seem to always match what other reviewers want to see, but I can wholeheartedly award these four stars and fully recommend the film based on the strength of its action scenes, quality of its storyline, and the presence of its lead star.

8660327,4,B00KNVF2SG,"A good action flick. Always fun to watch Steve in action. Lots of blood and violence which is expected. Action scenes were a little choppy due to very mediocre choreography. Sometimes it was hard to tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys as there were some plot confusion problems here. But I watched this movie on streaming Netflix because I'm a fan and I wanted to see Steve kick some you know what. And that he did. Best part of the movie: some very cool dialogue from Steve, especially when he was threatening people before he killed them, and Steve was the good guy. Worst part of the movie: it didn't really have a coherent plot. But no matter. Steven rocks. Cool sword Steve.",1518825600,,697,4.410852713178294
