1221972,2,B00000IC9S,I didn't like this movie at all. It shows how helpless Christopher Reeves was after his horse riding accident. It makes me sad. I prefer to remember him as a strong capable man in Superman or Somewhere in Time. He should have passed on making this one :(,1445472000,,254,4.3125

1221979,5,B00000IC9S,"I half to be honest remakes don't always work, but what I love most about this movie is the acting & the fact that Christopher reeve had the courage to keep working even after his unfortunate accident that left him paralyzed. Daryl Hannah is very good in her role as his personal secretary. I love this movie even though it is a remake the older one don't get me wrong is better.",1370390400,4,379,4.277777777777778
1221980,3,B00000IC9S,"This was a remake of an Hickok movie.  I must admit I liked the original much better .  I bought the movie because of Daryl Hannah as I like her movies.
If you liked the original movie it will be a stretch to watch this.  Reeve did a good job in this movie, working around his disability. The movie lacked the suspense of the original movie .  But it was a movie to watch if you like remakes of older movies and the two actors that made this movie .",1364774400,2,449,3.9555555555555557
1221981,5,B00000IC9S,One of my favorite movies. Christopher Reeve is just amazing. This is a great remake but I have to say that I'm still quite partial to the one made by James Stewart and Grace Kelley.,1363564800,3,182,4.228571428571429

1221983,5,B00000IC9S,"After seeing ""the original"" with Jimmy Stewart (?)....many yrs. ago, I was interested just HOW they handled-it 'this time around'.
  With the living space on 3-floors.....this gives the 'plot' many chances to throw a monkey wrench into this film.....Chris Reeve did an excellent job as 'the main character' & I immagine, without checking, this part WAS specifically for him after his horse tragedy.  YES.....I'd recommend-it.....just to see the 'human side' of Chris Reeve himself.",1347148800,4,481,5.472972972972973

1221986,3,B00000IC9S,"I remember trying to watch this years ago (with the Hitchcock version firmly etched in my memory) and writing it off as a cheap, commercial television movie. Well, it certainly isn't the most lavish production but since seeing it (somewhat peripherally) on a cable movie channel recently, I have a new-found respect for it. Taken on its own, it has decent production values along with a heartfelt performance by Christopher Reeve. At times it seems like a true labor of love by those involved and winds up being an effective entertainment. Special kudos goes to composer David Shire for a very fine music score.",1233619200,8,611,4.884615384615385
1221987,5,B00000IC9S,REMAKE OF AN OLDIE BUT GOODIE.  LOVED THE MOVIE.  CHRISTOPHER REEVE DID A GREAT JOB.  SIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIE.,1222128000,2,121,4.173913043478261
1221988,3,B00000IC9S,"This film begins on a highway at night. A driver on a cell phone strays over the divider line and there is a head-on collision. Architect Kemp is in a hospital bed and interviewed by police detective Charlie. The other driver died at the scene. Kemp undergoes rehabilitation - his neck was broken. These scenes are educational. Kemp will return to his home and await a cure for a full recovery. His ex-wife Lila visits him. Kemp returns home with a private attendant. The police detective returns to tell Kemp the other driver was at fault. Kemp watches the occupants of the building across the courtyard. [Don't they own drapes or just don't care?] Why doesn't Kemp watch cable TV for vicarious thrills? Like the earlier version, you need to interpret the actions of the people. Its like a modern silent film. Couldn't that couple just go on the ""Jerry"" show to resolve their differences?

Kemp installed cameras to watch his neighbors. [Isn't that illegal?] Then he hears a woman's screams in the night, followed by stillness. Dogs bark in the night. Did something happen? Kemp notices the absence of the battered wife. The police detective shows up and tells them Kemp's allegation lacks corroboration; the known facts say his wife left on a visit to her sister. Later the wife returns - but is there a difference? Claudia does her detective work, but a page reveals her snooping. Will something happen to reveal Kemp's spying? Will Thorpe threaten Kemp? Will somebody's plan go awry? [What about fingerprints or DNA evidence?] Will help arrive just in time for a happy ending? Can murder be proven without a body? {Yes, but not in this case.] Did the police overlook something?

This is a modern version of Hitchcock's famous 1954 film. I think it is a good film, but the original seemed better because of a richer story and cast. The film cleverly used the condition of Christopher Reeve. [Always wear a seat belt!] There seems to be a flaw in this film. Concrete is porous, a body encased in concrete should emit the odor of putrefaction. But maybe nobody noticed this in this Village? That couple spent so much time together in their rooms that is suggests ""cabin fever"".",1218585600,,2178,4.7592592592592595
1221989,1,B00000IC9S,This stinks. Don't remake classic Hitchcock films. If you think this is bad just wait until The Birds is remade in 2009. Unless somebody stops it that is.,1209600000,3,154,4.535714285714286
1221990,3,B00000IC9S,"The idea is great since it comes from a master mind of suspense. The main actor is also great because he plays his own role as a crippled victim of a dumb accident. But at the same time something is wrong in the extraordinary exhibitionism of these Americans who do not know what a blind is and who broadcast every single of their sighs to the whole neighborhood through open windows and paper thin walls. It makes the voyeur in this case practically justified since there is no other way but hear and see. But that's too easy. It takes a lot of the secrecy of this voyeuristic knowledge out of the story. The suspense itself is even in many ways reduced, crippled. From a dark and frightening film we shift in this remake to a plain action film with a cripple as the main character who is beautifully rendered by Christopher Reeve, but that is not enough to make a great film. This remake is not really improving, nor even getting close to the original.

1221992,3,B00000IC9S,"Christopher Reeve was forced to stay on a wheelchair since his tragic 1995 equestrian fall... He was lonely and with emptiness in his new life... His approach to the window was not an act of voyeurism, but a sincere wish to see how life was going on...

Reeve was observing what he could never do again... He was watching the movements of everybody: lovers, newlyweds, lonely hearts, old people... And for the fact of being a real-life quadriplegic, he gave the performance of his life... He was the perfect choice in the role of a distinguished architect whose life becomes altered after a violent car collision...

Paralyzed from neck down, and surrounded by cell phones, computer, voice-activated technology, Jason Kemp is in complete control from his astonished therapy operation suite... He is able, with only his voice, to turn on the lights, to open the elevator, to exchange e-mails with the killer...

But Reeve was also communicating to us his severe moments with great close-ups to his anguish face... We watch his breathing difficulties from the breathing machine...

Reeve was seen as the man, who was not acting all the time... His face related it several times... We felt his distress, his bitterness, his agony, his vulnerability... And as much as he suffered in silence, he fought for life... His weakness was his endeavors for perseverance...

Christopher Reeve (1952-2004) was a superhero in his determination and tenacity... He proved it in being the first Quadriplegic actor on a high-tech wheelchair in a leading role... He gave, under Jeff Bleckner wise direction, a perfect, chilling performance and a highly entertaining remake...",1168473600,7,1655,5.114814814814815
1221993,3,B00000IC9S,"Watching this rather pedestrian remake of Hitchcock's classic film is somewhat sad but uplifting.  Christopher Reeve displayed a tremendous amount of courage in playing a role so shadowing his real life.  Knowing that the late actor had to go through so many of the therapeutic remedies and the horrifying life of paraplegia makes his performance more emotional.  As for the plot itself, it's formulaic and the ending is not a very satisfying one.  But Reeve is impressive and he gets some decent support from Darryl Hannah, Ritchie Colter and Robert Forster.  It's not as suspenseful as the original but is a testament to Reeve's endurance and determination.",1159056000,3,659,5.121495327102804
1221994,4,B00000IC9S,"I don't get the bad reviews on this movie. I LOVE it and have it watched it more than once. In fact, I searched a long time for this one with Christopher Reeve, it was hard to find but I finally found it at Big Lots. :)",1155772800,2,219,3.6808510638297873
1221995,2,B00000IC9S,"So many films have been remade in recent years, and I'm always fascinated as to why. The only justifiable reason that I can see for remaking a film, is if the original had potential, but was in the hands of the wrong director. In the case of 'Rear Window', Alfred Hitchcock's original version was close to perfection. That being the case, why did anyone feel a need to remake it?

While sticking to the basic storyline of a man confined to his apartment and becoming suspicious that a neighbour has murdered his wife, there are a few changes. Christopher Reeve plays the lead character, who is not a photographer but an architect, and has been pompously renamed Jason Kemp. Also the lead female role, played by Daryl Hannah, is not his girlfriend (to begin with) but his colleague. And there are some other differences here and there, such as the lack of exploration into the complexities of relationships, and the fact that Jason Kemp has two medical assistants on call 24 hours instead of an insurance nurse that visits daily. I suppose the makers deviated in these areas so that the film would not look like an exact copy of the original, but these differences do very little, and in some cases let the film down.

For a thriller, this film hardly manages to mildly scare. Jeff Bleckner's direction does not labour on key points in the film long enough to generate much tension, nor is there much atmosphere. The film's soundtrack also does not help matters. The best part of the film is Christopher Reeve, who does stand out from a cast with little substance. Thelma Ritter's character of an insurance nurse in Alfred Hitchcock's version, has more spark than the two medical assistants in this film put together. Then again, that may be largely due to the relatively shallow script that the actors have to work with.

That being said, this was a very needless remake. Not all of Alfred Hitchcock's films were classics, but when it comes to his best films, I don't believe it's possible to improve on them. Apart from this attempt, 'Psycho' has been remade, as well as multiple remakes of 'The 39 Steps'. Let's hope it stops there.",1152835200,2,2134,4.685333333333333
1221996,3,B00000IC9S,"I am a huge fan of Rear window, I loved the classic and have watched my own copy until it died.  So I was not sure if I wanted to really see this remake; but my love of Chrisopher Reeve convinced me it would be a shame to miss it.  I am so glad I didn't, while I still think the orginal is better, it was so wonderful to see Mr. Reeve in front of the camera again.  I still held my breath when the bad guy went after him, and sighed with relief when he, and his lady love, lived to tell the tale.  Your really can NOT ask more than that.  If Rear Window HAD to be remade you couldn't have asked for a better actor to take over the Jimmy Stewart role.

I will miss Mr. Reeve, but his work does go over well here.",1146787200,8,711,3.77027027027027
1221997,3,B00000IC9S,"Quite simply, a curiosity piece.  For what he had to deal with, Mr. Reeves deserves applause but...you just shouldn't mess with Hitchcock classics...sorry.",1138233600,7,155,5.739130434782608
1221998,4,B00000IC9S,"I can count the number of remakes on one hand that deserve checking out. This is one of them. Christopher Reeve is excellent in the part that James Stewart played in the original Alfred Hitchock classic. I have the vast majority of Hictchock movies on DVD. I don't think this takes anything from the original. It is just another perspective that happens to work very well. Using a  real paraplegic instead of a pretend set of broken legs made it more realistic to me. Anyone that insist on watching only original versions is blinding themselves to excellent entertainment. I have seen my share of dud remakes, but this isn't one of them. I highly recommend anyone that likes thrillers to give it a chance. Another remake I recommend is ""12 Angry Men"" with William Petersen. Let's hope they release this version of ""Rear Window"" on DVD. I have the James Stewart version and it is great, but I'd like to have this for my collection too. Fans of Christopehr Reeve should also get ""Somewhere in Time"" and ""The Aviator"".",1107129600,2,1015,4.670391061452514
1221999,4,B00000IC9S,"While I'm not one to truly enjoy a remake, Christopher Reeve's version of ""Rear Window"" is very good. This movie was made three years after his horse ridding accident, so the wheelchair, respirator and rehabilitation is real. Reeve plays an architect who is involved in a head-on collision that has left him paralyzed. When he comes back to work, he has his own room in the floor above where he works and a new view to go with it. As in the original, he's got too much time on his hands and starts to get nosy with the people in the building next door. I'll leave the rest for those who haven't seen the movie yet.

I really enjoyed Reeve's acting in this movie. Darryl Hannah plays the Grace Kelly role, and that's the only reason I gave it four stars. Hannah is no Grace Kelly, and her performance is kind of lame. But the plot and the story line is good and for the most part, so is the acting.",1101513600,22,897,4.245614035087719
1222000,4,B00000IC9S,"Hitchcock was a brilliant director. This is the only remake of a Hitchcock film that I think was better than the original. Why is this one better? It built on what Hitch had done and kept the best. Reeves -- a parapalegic playing a parapalegic -- was brilliant. Al of the acting was in the face. Gestures could not help. There were so many little touches and glimpses into Christopher Reeves real life. I would have like to have seen Reeves receive an Oscar for this performance. It was that good. Not everything about the film was great, but Reeves performance and the glimpses into the life of a parapalegic who could care about a stranger raise the film to great heights and make it even more enjoyble to watch than the original. I have both. I would like to have this one on DVD.",1045180800,4,783,4.406896551724138
1222001,3,B00000IC9S,"This movie has been vigorously lambasted by most of the previous reviewers as being an inept and forgettable ripoff of Hitchcock's classic.
Yet there are some aspects of this movie that I would submit rival (and even surpass) the original:
1. The villain here is a lot scarier than in Hitchcock's version.  That chilling shot when the guy finally looks across the way to see Reeve staring at him is much more heart-pounding in this version.
2. Christopher Reeves's is a much more convincing character than that of Stewart's.
3. The scene in which the villain confronts the Peeping Tom is much more intense in this version.
4.  Reeve's relationship with the woman rings much truer; in Hitchcock's version I kept wondering what a dish like Grace Kelly's character would be doing wasting her time with Stewart's aging character.
5.  The ending in the remake is much more ambiguous; one gets the palpable feel that, even after their suspicions were roundly dashed, there is an nefarious element hanging in the air, only facets of which can ever be known.  Hitchcock's ending doesn't have any of this.
Nevertheless, there are a thousand little reasons why Hitchcock's version is, on balance, a superior effort; my only point is that this redux doesn't deserve to be consigned to the dustbin of VHS history.",1028937600,3,1301,4.9

I found it very heart-warming and touching a story about Jason Kemp who is a qudriplegic! Reeve invested most of his experiences into this role which was indeed very tailor-made for him, and the result is good chemistry between him and Hannah! I could understand why many did not like this movie because it wasn't like the original, but since I've never seen the original, I really couln't passjudgement!

Movies like Somewhere in Time and Death Trap are two of his best movies. This one is even better seeing despite his condition he agreed
to play this character who in the original just had a broken leg. I don't know many who would have tried to do this. Look at his facial expressions
and he's still acting not just playing himself in a wheel chair. How he could concentrate on the part is amazing. The movie while not as thrilling
