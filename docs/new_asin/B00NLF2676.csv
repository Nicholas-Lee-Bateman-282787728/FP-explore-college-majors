8678823,2,B00NLF2676,"The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because my daughter absolutely LOVE Squeak. We recently moved and decided to go to ""streaming"" for our tv usage. While we can access some of the Baby's first programs like Harry the Bunny, Color Crew, and all star via our HULU account, there is absolutely no Squeak available through HULU. So.... we decided to spend the $15  on the video to appease our 15 month old daughter but for $15 there is only 2 episodes of Squeak and 2 short songs which is EXTREMELY aggravating & annoying. Anyway, we feel that for the cost of the dvd, it should include way more than 2 episodes. Buy it if you want to treat your child to their fav show like we did, but not suggested for more than that.",1434326400,6,723,4.239130434782608
