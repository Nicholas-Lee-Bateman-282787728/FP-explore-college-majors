2416015,3,B000BDGWGC,"Bang Rajan is an exciting tale of heroism on the part of ordinary people forced into extraordinary circumstances and carrying off the task of resistance to invasion better than the Thai Army apparently was able to do. My only fault with the film was the use of ambient light only, leaving most of the action virtually invisible, as the battles seem to have taken place primarily at night or in rainstorms. The final battle is watchable and most graphic. Story was easy to follow. Good use of subtitles, introduction and wrap-up. Just a few floodlights for the night scenes and this would be a truly grand film. But maybe that's not what the producer's wanted. Real war, in the dark, is no doubt chaotic.
In a way this film reminded me of the Northern Ireland drama ""Bloody Sunday"" where the lack of a tripod or Steadicam made the picture almost nauseating to watch. There was no excuse for that. The budget and possible need for the actors to work day jobs likely forced the producers of Bang Rajan to shoot in the dark.",1223251200,10,1020,4.579234972677596
2416016,4,B000BDGWGC,"Even the proud proclamaition of ""Oliver Stone presents"" across the top of the DVD wasn't enough to get the masses to check this out... it's a shame too because this is a borderline great(albeit flawed) Thai war epic based on actual historic events.  The story follows the tale of a small Siamese village and it's legendary ability to repeatably withstand the invading Burmese empire.  Although made with a meager budget(especially in comparison to it's American contemporaries), Bang Rajan is able to deliver in most of the areas necessary to make a war movie work.  The battles are filmed well(although the fight at the begining is too dark and shaky for it's own good, thankfully this isn't a continuing trend throughout the rest of the picture) and provides enough cringe worthy moments to keep the ugly realism of war intact(arrows through necks, severed limbs, bashed heads, etc.).  A strong musical score fits nicely too, and really helps propel both the action as well as the more dramatic beats.  Honestly there is only one thing that holds this movie back... character development.  Unfortunately nearly all of the characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts(i.e., the drunken warrior, the emotionless leader, the soon-to-be father) who get very little backstory(if any) and are basically the same at the end of the film as they were at their inception(except maybe dead).  Don't get me wrong, you still like the characters, however; it's more because you feel for their plight and that they are shown to be good and honorable people(while the Burmese are portrayed as a souless conquering horde) rather than having any growing ties to them.  There are definite moments that would have been far more poignant with more expansion of the characters.  Another reviewer stated that they felt the acting wasn't up to par, which seems a tad unfair.  The film is subtitled so I would argue the difficulty to judge the acting completely without being able to understand the actual delivery of the dialogue.  The characters are strong and stoic(especially the leader of Bang Rajan, who it should be noted sports a killer mustache!) and are prepared to sacrifice everything for their freedom, and that comes across perfectly I thought.  As Americans we've been spoiled with some truly great and epic war films, Bang Rajan isn't quite on their level BUT it's still a very good film that fans of the genre(and mustaches!) should catch at least once.",1204848000,3,2451,5.03960396039604

2416018,2,B000BDGWGC,"This film tells the story of a great battle where a group of village of Thai villages held off a major army from Burma history. The story itself, I found well explained. I found the story line appeared to be weak. The acting I thought was poor. The action was okay.

If you are going to do a movie like this, I think you need to spend more money then what people did on this movie.",1147824000,2,381,4.0131578947368425
2416019,4,B000BDGWGC,"the stroyline of the screenplay is a little shallow, but the directing, acting, camera are all good, especially the stunt, the choregraphic design of the fight scenes are amazingly fantastic. the only problem i found in thai historical movie is the hairdo. almost every one of the male and female roles in this movie are with hairdos that only hairdressers could have done and with lot of gel used. but again, the alamo-like fighting scenes are so vicious and realistic just like what best korean movies could deliver.",1142812800,,518,4.8977272727272725

2416021,5,B000BDGWGC,"Bang Rajan won over eleven film awards including Best Picture and Best Director.  This hard hitting true story of a group of villagers pitted against the entire Burmese army in 1765 will keep you on the egde of your seat.  Never quiet even in its quiet moments you will follow these villagers as they plot, defend and ultimately sacrifice their lives to keep their homeland free.  The lush tropicalness of Thailand, the savagery of battle is brilliantly captured, and the final fight with characters you have come to care about is heartwrenching to watch, and extremely graphic!  This is not your average war film so be prepared, but do see it.  You will NEVER forget Bang Rajan!",1131494400,25,679,4.769230769230769

8086305,5,B000BDGWGC,"I saw this movie a long time ago on cable and I wanted to have it on DVD. It is the national epic of Thailand about a time when the Burmese army has invaded and the Thai King and his army bugged out, leaving the village people to fend for themselves. Most hit the road in hopes of escaping the invaders but one man in one village said no, and he and his small bad stood their ground and fought back. At first the Burmese were stunned but eventually their greater numbers and ruthlessness won the day. If you like foreign movies and sword play is your think, you've got to see this one.",1426032000,,585,4.140350877192983
8086306,5,B000BDGWGC,"I enjoyed this film; however, I don't recommend it for anyone under 17 years of age due to the graphic violence.  I enjoy movies with a historical theme and this movie showed how women participated in the defense of their village.",1376006400,,230,4.609756097560975
8086307,4,B000BDGWGC,"I believe this is the first Thai film I ever saw and I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is a quite well done historical superproduction about events which really took place and it is an interesting viewing even for those (like me) who have no knowledge of Thai history or Thai civilization. The review which follows contains some limited SPOILERS.

If I understood things correctly, the real events which inspired this film took place between August 1765 and January 1766. In this time Thailand was known as the Kingdom of Siam and sometimes also as Ayutthaya, after the name of its capital. The Ayutthaya period in Thai history lasted from 1350 to 1767 and during this time the country expanded its territory and rose to become a major regional power. However beginning in 1548 Ayutthaya kingdom entered in a long term conflict with neigboring Burma and those bloody and costly wars lasted until 1614. After another short war in 1662-64 both sides had enough and agreed on a peace treaty.

This peace lasted until 1759, when Ayutthaya imprudently supported an internal rebellion of Mon nation in Burma. In 1759-60 war the Burmese defeated the Siamese and only the sickness and death of their king Alaungpaya stopped them from taking the city of Ayutthaya itself. But in 1765 a new Burmese king, Hsinbyushin, decided to finish the job and invaded Siam with two large armies, advancing towards Ayutthaya from north (beginning its march in August) and south (which left in October). The southern army arrived at Ayutthaya in December 1765 but the norhern one met unexpected trouble and although it was the first to march, at that moment it was still stuck.

The first who stopped Burmese northern army were northern feodal lords who had their own troops. Once they were defeated in August-October 1765, the Burmese continued their advance but then they met another foe, which they did not include in their calculations - a local peasant militia, poorly armed but numerous, whose headquarters were in a large northern village Bang Rajan. Siamese peasants were not initially very motivated to fight, but were pushed to their limit by the brutality of advancing Burmese. The invading army was capturing people as slaves and in the process women were raped and old and invalid murdered. Even in places where they were not taking slaves, the Burmese were seizing all the food and taking away the livestock. The Siamese peasants armed themselves with whatever they had and fought back with energy of desperation, with many women joining the men in combat. After winning some small battles by suprising the enemy, the peasant militia became better armed and got more confident and better organised. Completely surprised by this extremely determined foe, the Burmese were stopped in their progress for months.

This film is the description of those dramatic months of desperate fight around Bang Rajan, as seen by the leaders of this peasant army. Being an adventure film, ""Bang Rajan"" includes many elements which were probably added later but which so firmly entered the national memory that they couldn't be discarded - and I think it was the right decision, as it embellishes the film. The director kept this film under strict control and mercilessly eliminated unnecessary things - as the result, even if this film lasts 127 minutes I never got bored. For obvious reasons actors were completely unknown to me but I believe they all did a good job.

This film permits to discover a pretty unique kind of art of war in use in South-East Asia roughly between 1525 (introduction of European firearms by the Portuguese) and 1825 (first Anglo-Burmese War):

- in XVIII century armies of both Siam and Burma were mostly composed of a mass of peasant conscripts serving as light infantry, with the spears, short slashing swords and knives being the only weapons. Those troops wore no armor (and seemingly not even shields) and no uniform. Some infantry troops were made of professionals and they would be armed at least partially with muskets (no bayonets though) and would wear some kind of uniform and at least a light helmet. Some infantrymen would also use bows and arrows or crossbows, but in XVIII century those weapons were being more and more replaced with firearms.

- mounted troops were not very numerous and composed mostly of nobles, who could afford a horse. They fought mostly with bows or muskets and lances, with some wealthier men carrying also a pistol or two and wearing some kind of armor. War elephants played still a role, as generals rode them frequently into battle and they also carried turrets with some sharpshooters with muskets inside. Finally artillery also played an important role, woth both light field cannons and heavy siege guns being used.

Amongst the things which surprised me was women's haircut style - they all had their hair cut really short and in an unusual and rather unattractive way. As the result, if you want to look at some Asian beauties, were, you will have to watch another film... Also, in fighting scenes, I couldn't help but wonder, why almost nobody was using shields? Even a bamboo or wicker shield is better than nothing in a fight where almost everybody uses slashing weapons - and they are not so hard to make.

On another hand, what I really appreciated was that martial arts were virtually absent. That was a good decision by the director, considering that if martial arts are very useful as sport and a way to perfect ourselves, they have virtually not use on the real battlefield.

Finally, without willing to say too much, I must just warn you, that this film is not only pretty violent but also quite tragic. This is an epic tale, but definitely not a ""feel good"" one...

So bottom line, this is a good, solid, interesting adventure/war movie, dramatic, tragic and pretty moving, especially towards the end. I am keeping my DVD for a rewatch one day. Enjoy!",1358726400,,5915,4.881474103585657

8086310,5,B000BDGWGC,"Exciting action packed movie that tells the tale of some of history's forgotten heros. Filmed on location, so realistic you will think it was yesterday insted of hundreds of years ago. Better than most American films.",1327190400,,217,5.055555555555555
8086311,4,B000BDGWGC,"This film is based on actual events from the history of the Thai people. It occurred in 1767 when the ever encroaching Burmese made a pro longed invasion of their neighbour Siam. They raided the locals and demanded among other things the surrender of all unmarried girls. This led some villagers to attack the Burmese. They retaliated and things spiralled from there.

In the film it gets straight into the fighting and then leaves character and to some extent plot development till after we have had some gore. That may sound like a criticism, but actually it was quite good to get a taste of the action up front. The fighting is dubbed, which is a pity, like old martial arts films are; you know the sort where they punch a gloved hand to indicate a punch on flesh. That was a bit poor, but a lot of attention has gone into the fights and no cgi.

It is up to the people of this lone village to stand against the Burmese aggressor and they ruddy well  did, this is their story.

The characters are developed only in so far as to let us know their basic character, good, brave, drunkard etc. This has often led critics to accuse Asian cinema of being `childish', but that is really cultural imperialism, as that is how some people are.

The villagers have a Buddhist Priest who they put great faith in, and a newly elected leader Nai Chen Nuad Kheo (with a huge moustache!) ; he takes over after their chief is wounded fighting the invaders. He then sets about organising a defence and prepare for a siege. The authorities in the capital Ayutthaya, offer no help - which came as a blow and is actually true.

This film cost a fortune to make, but made a bigger one back, it got limited screenings outside of Asia, but did see the light of day in America being presented by Oliver Stone. It is one for those who like a bit of history, lots of fighting and plenty of action. I really enjoyed it, it is also quite accurate on the historical front (including the fighting water buffalo) and they have an honest ending. I would gladly recommend on that basis and the certification is definitely for the blood and guts violence, so no rude stuff to worry about -shame.",1307404800,,2163,4.435768261964736
8086312,5,B000BDGWGC,"What a well made film! Excellent direction, editing, and photography. I should think many Hollywood production people would be impressed and even envious. The acting was not dramatic in style. It was not phony ethographic either. Acting was not what carried the film, but it was just fine.

It was more bloody than I would have liked, but the shots of the violence were so well done that I let the amount of it go.

I very much liked that it seemed realistic and not overplayed in western terms of individual heroism and this helped me to visualize village life in South East Asia at that time in history better than I had images to use before this.",1301961600,,649,4.491525423728813
