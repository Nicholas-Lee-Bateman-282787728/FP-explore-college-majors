8724032,4,B011BRKL86,"Enjoyable sword and sandals film that has no connection whatsoever with the historical reality of the Spartacus slave revolt in Ancient Rome.

First rate cast and acting.  The arena scenes involving plenty of lions are among the best in the whole Peplum movie genre.

Gianna Maria Canale plays a spoiled and cruel Patrician lady who wants to have her female slave killed as a result of a romantic triangle.  She was to play the Roman villainess in such subsequent Peplums as SLAVE GIRL OF CARTHAGE and THE WARRIOR AND THE SLAVE GIRL",1499817600,,532,4.75
