2561503,5,B000FDE5TY,"I am so glad that they're releasing this show to dvd. It's my favorite reality show. When this show first premiered, there was nothing like it on tv. Very creative and intense. I hope they release every season of this suspensful and fun show.",1149033600,3,242,4.5227272727272725
2561504,5,B000FDE5TY,"I'm so surprised that the only other review of this dvd set is so negative.  If you don't like the show, why bother reviewing it?  These reviews are for the items being sold, and it's not released yet.  It's not a forum for the actual show.  The stunts are hardly dangerous, or they would never be allowed to happen.  It's safer to be a contestant on Fear Factor than it is to walk down the street.  I'm excited about the release of this first season because I didn't start watching the show until the 3rd season, and I love it, cockroaches and all.",1146096000,10,549,4.281553398058253
2561525,5,B000FDE5TY,THIS WAS AMAZING I LOVED IT,1414022400,,27,3.6666666666666665
2561526,5,B000FDE5TY,Love it! I really wish the other seasons would be released on DVD,1411257600,,65,4.076923076923077
2561527,5,B000FDE5TY,"I'm convinced the late 90's and early 2000's had the best reality television shows.. Fear Factor came around as the first of its kind: a reality show that puts people through their fears for a cash prize. While this first season is pretty tame as far as the stunts go, the editing is superior to later seasons because it aids in the building of tension and anxiety that is lacking in later seasons. Another thing I love about this show is that it is something everyone can relate to. You at home can sit and watch, asking yourself, ""Could I do that?"" It's a show that puts people on the edge and it's fun to watch how they react to the stunts. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of reality TV and to anyone who appreciates good reality television.",1408665600,2,754,4.316901408450704
2561528,4,B000FDE5TY,Loved this show when it was on TV. My kids got to watch this and really enjoyed it as well.,1400284800,,91,3.6
2561529,5,B000FDE5TY,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this show. A bunch of extreme stunts done by six random people, does not sound like a good premise. But the result was actualy very interesting. The stunts look very tough but many of them would be fun to do, although many will bawk at doing any of the second stunts.

The only negative aspect to mention is the fact that every episode has different cast members. I'm used to watching reality shows where the cast grows on you. This is a show that has Survivor/Amazing Race premise but behaves like Wheel of Fortune/Price is right. So it took me awhile to get used to that, as it seems the show wants us to bond with the cast but there's so little time to do so.

Other then that, good show and I'm glad there's at least some of it lurking out there.",1394582400,,788,4.211920529801325
2561530,5,B000FDE5TY,THIS SHOW IS SO FREAKING AWESOME AND THE HOST IS FUNNY AND CUTE AND I WOULD REALLY WISH TO DO SOME OF THE STUNTS OMG,1393977600,,116,3.68
2561531,4,B000FDE5TY,"Most adults remember this weird and gross TV show. My young nieces and nephews do not but were riveted when they watched this DVD. Now, I have to buy all the seasons!!",1382572800,,167,4.25
2561532,4,B000FDE5TY,"I am obsessed with The Fear Factor. When I saw that it wad on DVD I had to have it! I'm not a HUGE fan of the first season, because I don't think it's all that ""gross, squirmy, etc"" as the later seasons, but I had to have it. I really wish they would release the rest of the seasons on DVD. I would own them all!",1360627200,,312,3.671641791044776
2561533,5,B000FDE5TY,I loved Fear Factor when it first came out and it's awesome that it's back on tv. The price for the first season dvd's is ridiculous.,1333584000,,133,4.153846153846154
2561534,5,B000FDE5TY,The product was shipped with high quality and was sent on time.  I would use this vendor again for all of my video and or dvd needs.,1327104000,,132,3.888888888888889
2561545,5,B000FDE5TY,I really liked this show...Hope Season 2 and others come out soon...This is the Best of these type of shows!,1317168000,,108,4.45
2561546,5,B000FDE5TY,"Such a great show and a fun set to watch with friends and fam for a good gross out or laugh.  I'd love for them to release more seasons, but like with every other good reality series, the releases were few and far between and we'll never get to complete any of these sets...",1301011200,,274,4.074074074074074
2561547,5,B000FDE5TY,"We are very happy and satisfied with our product. It is in excellent condition. The best part of it all,we did not wait forever to get our dvd.",1273968000,,143,4.142857142857143
2561548,4,B000FDE5TY,"Fear Factor is my favorite show of all time so I hate to only give this DVD set 4 stars. My big complaint about this DVD is that it is missing the season one highlights episode. This is the only season of fear factor on DVD so I would at least expect the entire season to be on it. Come on NBC, just release the entire series.",1273795200,,326,3.8805970149253732
2561549,5,B000FDE5TY,"whats the hold up on releaseing the other Seasons?
i want to buy them all.
i love this show.
i feel like shooting someone when they get you hooked on a show then not release it. >:(",1261353600,,181,3.918918918918919
2561550,5,B000FDE5TY,"I loved Fear Factor when I was younger, and this DVD set is perfect. Two DVD's full of hours of the nasty and intense Fear Factor show, hosted by Joe Rogan. No special features, but that's ok.",1249689600,,192,4.216216216216216
2561551,4,B000FDE5TY,"I really like ""Fear Factor"" and each and every show has something different and unique to add and new challenges to face and fears to over come. I always look foward to watching these shows on the television to see what stunts are going to come up with next and of course to see who is going to win the money.

I have hope that some of the challenges I will be able to face and over come one day because life is too short not to live well, and being afraid of certain challenges in life is not good. Of course I would never do the extremely dangerous stunts... but I do have a fear of heights that I would like to face and over come.

 The only problem that I can see with these sets is that after you watch them one time, you don't really care to watch them again! I have got my moneys worth because the price is not bad at only $20 and I have let other people borrow my set and they have enjoyed it also. (Plus you can sell it back to Amazon or on Ebay if you get tired of it and make some money back, if you choose to.)

 I can see why these sets do not sell is much because many people don't enjoy this type of ""gross out"" show and plus it is not the type of show that you would watch over and over again. I hope that they continue to complete the rest of seasons on dvd, but also offer these sets at a really reasonable price so that we will get are money's worth for what we buy.

All in all I recommend buying this set for anyone who loves ""Fear Factor"" and of course it always makes a good conversation starter for groups of people to watch and enjoy together. This season has a good variety of episodes from difficult phisical challenges to mental challenges of eating something gross. This is a very fun show to watch and get carried away with, but don't try these stunts at home :)",1168732800,,1792,4.019662921348314
2561552,4,B000FDE5TY,"Its about time Fear Factor was released on DVD - Especially for Australian, who have never seen the first few series.

They could have put a few special features in though, otherwise, a great DVD.  Can't wait for future seasons to be released.",1168300800,,243,4.627906976744186

8121059,4,B000FDE5TY,Ludacris actually makes for a pretty good host. This is one of my favorite shows of all time so there's that going it regardless. I don't think this was the best episode though. Overall I don't think it lives up to the original really in anyway but it's still good and I like Ludacris.,1525478400,,285,4.296296296296297
