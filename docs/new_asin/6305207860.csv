985354,2,6305207860,"Dolph Lundgren is Major Max Gatling hired to rescue a big companys daughter named Jude (Melanie Zanetti), who is trapped inside an unnamed South East Asian city quarantined because of viral outbreak. Most residents have turned into zombies there, but the major is determined to find the girl.

Shot on location in Johor Baru, Malaysia, Battle of the Damned starts out promisingly, making good use of the existing buildings and streets. The action (mostly guns and knives) are not particularly impressive, but as a low-budget action movie it is acceptable.

About thirty minutes in, however, the story gets stuck. This often happens in zombie movies when characters hold out in a building (like a house or shopping mall). Filmmakers need some trick to keep us interested, but unfortunately, in Battle of the Damned nothing really interesting happens in the next thirty minute.

But, despite the numerous flaws, there is one thing you will not forget. It is robots (made in Tokyo). Dont ask me why they are there. The effects (CGI and practical) are cheap. Action sequences are badly shot, but still the film manages to entertain, with Dolph Lundgren, zombies and killer robots. My two stars go to this outlandish idea. As for the rest of the film, you may fast-forward it.",1391817600,,1271,4.957746478873239
985355,2,6305207860,"""Zombies, killer robots, nice town you got here."" After a viral outbreak causes people to turn into zombies, military soldier Max Gatling (Lundgren) is called into battle. Not only must he fight off the zombie army with a few human survivors, but a group of robots that have been trained to kill as well. Even though it sounds made up I swear that is the plot of the movie. I know what your initial thought is but I have actually seen worse. The thing that helped the movie is that it didn't take itself too serious. If they tried to be straight line and make it seem like a real war movie it would have been un-watchable. The fact that they added comedy and made it a little over the top made it seem better then it actually was. I'm not saying this is a good movie at all because this wouldn't be in my top ten choices to watch ever but in terms of Dolph Lundgren movies there have been much worse. Overall, the robots look like a rip off of the Lost In Space robot and the zombie effects are barely passable. A severely low budget World War Z knock off but again I have seen worse.

The filmakers were smart enough not to show extended shots of the dead so as not to exploit poor make up, I actually liked what I saw. The robots were somewhat poorly done with CGI (sad that CGI in Jurrassic Park from 2 decades ago looks better than most CGI now!) the movie is not reinventing the wheel, don't have high expectations and you might like it. The saddest part was watching Dolph run, he looks like Herman Munster unfortunately (and I like the guy).

985487,4,6305207860,"Apparently, this is the sequel to Robotropolis.  The robots in that film wind up in this film, towards the end.  The story is fairly basic and often used, send a team to rescue someone behind enemy lines.  In this case, a team of mercenaries enters a contained city dealing with the aftermath of a highly contagious pathogen that turns the bitten into zombies.  Naturally, the team is cut down to size in a matter of minutes.  Soon it's just the team leader (Dolph Lundgren as Major Max Gatling).  He searches-searches-searches while evading the ""eaters"" until happenstance, or bad plotting, requires that he crosses paths with the girl he was set out to retrieve.  Turns out, she is not the only survivor.  And then he has to deal with a pompous git who acts as their supreme leader.  Time is ticking away, the city is destined to be firebombed, will they make it out alive..................!?

Part of the problem with this movie is the beginning, where they get ahead of the story, merging past and present in a confusing fashion.  Suddenly they're in the city, in a melee, ""there is no backup!"", and the camera is wobbling all over the place.  The basic structure of the film is fight and run, repeat.  When the plot slows down so they can chatter, you might as well get up and wander around.  I did find two scenes worth noting, one involves a zombie taking a nap, the other is a fabulous shot of the team reflected in a pool of water.  It also irritated me that they defensively said they weren't fighting `zombies.'  If it looks and acts like a zombie..................",1437609600,3,1576,4.615107913669065

985556,3,6305207860,"- Dolph Lundgren: ""What do we do with zombies?""
- Robot: ""We f--- them up.""

In the dog-eat-dog world that is the direct-to-video market, your nightly B-flick selection rides on slim hope and morbid fascination and on withered cachet earned by faded stars. 2013's Battle of the Damned is zombie cinema done on the cheap but isn't as awful as you may assume. Doesn't mean it's a world beater of a movie, either. It stars Dolph Lundgren, fresh off his mumbling his way thru The Expendables franchise. The Expendables often takes place in exotic locales, and I've this mad image in my brain of Dolph finishing his scenes from the latest Expendables and then just parachuting down off Stallone's plane to start shooting this film. He doesn't bother to change wardrobe.

As Battle of the Damned opens, it's divulged thru title cards that Southeast Asia has become the hotbed for biotech corporations that want no part of complying with sanctions and regulations. These are the sort of skeevy places where doomsday scenarios originate. When a research lab accidentally unleashes a pathogen into the urban sprawl, a military blockade cuts off the city from the outside world.

Not that Major Max Gatling (Lundgren) is dissuaded. An ex-Green Beret who'd seen hot action in Mogadishu, Gatling has been contracted by a shady industrialist to sneak into the quarantined zone and sneak out again but with his daughter Jude in tow. What Gatling didn't expect was for the girl (Melanie Zanetti) to be ensconced with a band of survivors calling themselves ""the Damned."" And that she may not want to leave.

If you'd suddenly come down with a case of deja vu, it's 'cause the core premise is lifted from Resident Evil 2, even down to the race-against-the-clock threat of hellfire raining down on the city. Battle of the Damned is strictly a throwback, check-your-brain-at-the-door sort of movie. Low-rent production values. Lame dialogue. A bunch of no-namers. Emoting that ranges the entire spectrum, from Lundgren's wooden takes to David Field's mannered performance. Who's David Field? He plays the stealthily sleazy leader of the Damned whose crew is so pitiful and few its gang name doesn't deserve its capitalized ""D.""

Gorehounds be warned: these aren't really zombies. The infected are more those scurrying things from 28 Days Later. This means that kill shots don't have to focus solely on the brain. As a card-carrying gorehound myself, I feel that this diminishes the movie.

The film doesn't really invite you to latch on emotionally to its characters. Lundgren, who's showed up in fighting shape, is capable and stoic and so blank, and I find that his disturbed ""Gunnar Jensen"" from The Expendables has more of a personality. I can't make up my mind about Melanie Zanetti who plays Jude, the industrialist's daughter. She makes some dumb choices in the movie - like when she puts down her weapon in the market to scavenge from a shelf with an infected resting within grabbing distance. I won't even ask what good she thought putting on camo face paint would do against the infecteds. (And I don't mean to segue, but surely Lundgren's character knew the life-saving value of having a radio earpiece on.) But Zanetti has this quality - an impudence? Insouciance? - that reminds me a bit of Ellen Page if Page were slumming. Other than the sleazy Damned leader - who I just couldn't wait to get what's coming to him - the rest of the cast barely registers on my radar.

Sorry to say, the action is generic. We get some decent close quarters combat of Dolph vs. zombies. But what's really annoying is that the killer robots from Tokyo that were so prominent in the movie trailer don't show up until very late in the game. And then the robots vs. zombies melees weren't as badass as I'd hoped. It's plenty of the robots mowing down the undead with heavy firepower, but I'd wanted for more hands-on ripping of flesh. Also, I swear these robots are recycled from an earlier movie that Christopher Hatton directed:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotropolis/dp/B006VJ19OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotropolis</a>&nbsp;(2011). These blood-spattered killing machines - whose appearance is a plot swerve that is so out-of-place but wacky enough to be intriguing - were the big reason I tuned in. And they were pretty rad. I just wish they'd done more and had come in earlier. I swear the robot voice had more inflection in its line delivery than did stiff old Dolph. In the end, Battle of the Damned is what we thought it was: a low-budget, straight-to-video zombie fighting movie with decently-rendered robots and cult classic potential. A respectable 2.5 out of 5 stars.",1408406400,6,4706,5.0256410256410255

2. Usual opening explanation of the whole movie's premise for existence: A bad company releases some contagion into the city turning nearly everyone into (ho-hum) zombie types resulting in ...
3. The usual military quarantine of the city; the usual streets with vehicles askew (why they would be makes no sense) and trash nicely placed  to make it look, well trashy.
4. And, resulting in zombies who run around, always in mobs for some unknown doesn't-make-sense reason, sounding like snarling dogs. The sound didn't make sense and that their mouths don't move while producing the sound was quite an achievement.
5. Zombies scariest attribute was being splattered with dirt or dirt like stuff.
6. Another stolen plot hook of commandos being sent into rescue someone and as usual most of the commandos and most of those meant to be rescued don't make it - predictable as to whom.

985835,4,6305207860,"Ever since ""The Expendables"" graced theater screens, it seems every veteran tough-guy star from the 1980s has become hirable again. Dolph Lundgren has starred in his fair share of straight-to-DVD action flicks in the past few years. He now moves into the sci-fi / horror B-movie arena with ""Battle of the Damned."" A movie that has Lundgren kicking butt and blowing away the ""enemy"" can only get better when you add zombies AND robots to the equation.

Commander Max Gatling enters Thailand to rescue an industrialist's daughter from the clutches of populace infected with a virus that turns them into ravenous cannibals. He soon finds himself leading a small band of survivors across the destroyed city to be picked up by helicopter. As the masses of ferocious sick begin to overtake them, he does what any desperate hero would do to keep himself and his rag-tag group alive he trains battle-ready robots to help take out every hungry creature they see.

There's plenty of action, gore, and wanton destruction in ""Battle of the Damned."" It's about as good as it gets when diving into the world of sci-fi / horror B-movies. Did I mention robots? The real surprise with the robots is that they actually look good for a low-budget indie flick. The CGI used for them is quite convincing.

""Battle of the Damned"" is rated R for violence throughout and language. There's lots of digitally enhanced blood splatter as Lundgren chops and shoots his way through the crowds of walking dead. Of course you can't kill zombies without shouting expletives. One thing the movie doesn't have is any nudity or sensuality.

The DVD version of ""Battle of the Damned"" comes with only one special feature. There's a making-of featurette entitled ""Battling the Damned."" It's made up of B-roll footage and side-by-side comparisons of the filming process and the finished scene.

""Battle of the Damned"" will entertain anyone who loves B-movies that fit into the action, sci-fi, and horror genre. The best way to describe it is as a mix of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Escape from New York"" with a sprinkle of ""Battlestar Galactica"" when it comes to the robots. If you can excuse some of the bogus digitally-enhanced explosions and fire, you'll find yourself pleasantly distracted for an hour and a half.",1393372800,,2281,4.898963730569948

Why did I like this?  Dolph looked like he started slimming down and taking vitamins. He didn't move through
this movie like he was hurting.  That said-it should be noted that he was a producer here.
Setting:  Some not so nice (nasty) (abandoned? stacked Asian apartments in Malaysia-parking garages?) I could probably follow the credits and figure out where-but I don't care.
A virus is let loose in a big city in Asia.  The city is quarantined.  Dolph and his team are hired to go over the walls and rescue the daughter of the super-rich guy that was responsible for the virus, that got left behind.  There is a subplot: pay no attention...
Dolph and team go in.  Make-up on virus victims is dirty faces and bloody spit and rabid zombie-like hunger issues...ok.
The daughter is holed up in a nice, palace-like place with some other non Asian actors-Dolph finds her and decides to help rescue them before the city is firebombed.  With some help of some cheesy ""robots""---well, you will see...
The action sequences and cg were not awful, well, you will see,  I have never enjoyed jerky, action cam motions like seen in the Bourne dynasty movies, and this one does it as well.  Create a more frantic run scene with running feet views and sounds, or tree views and sound to cover the fact that people are all over the place watching you film...(that way you never see the spectators in the film)... I enjoyed the movie, as in OK.  Don't expect too much expensive special effects or acting....",1393027200,,1574,4.646209386281589

Yes, it does but this has some of the worst shaky camera I've seen in recent memory. Why do R-rated movies insist on using this? Especially this one because it's not like it's a big theatrical picture. I love to be able to SEE what's going on and not see what appears to be their cameraman having a seizure.

Everything else is what you'd expect in a Dolph B-movie. The effects look fine and the performances are good enough.... it's just that annoying shaky camera/hyper-editing garbage that movies still haven't grown out of that ruins it.",1392940800,,637,4.72972972972973

and rented it without any further consideration. In retrospect, I wish I had thought twice.
After 15 minutes I gave up on it altogether. My advice: do NOT waste your time or money on this stinkfest!

It's a hackneyed zombie film, where a lone man battles a city of infected creatures,
slaying crowds of them with a knife. This plays like a mindless and mediocre arcade game.

In case you're wondering, Dolph's mission: rescue his commanding officer's daughter
from a quarantined city where no one (or thing) can get in or out.

This is the absolute worst that shakicam has to offer,
and after a point I could not, WOULD not subject myself to such garbage.
Hope you don't, either.

985983,3,6305207860,"Zombies.  Robots.  Dolph Lundgren.  That was enough.  That is all that the movie needed to reel me in.  I love horror movies, love sci-fi, and love action, so really what else is there?  Naturally, my expectations were lowered, as this was a direct-to-video (DTV) release.  What that means is cheap effects, bad acting, and overpriced thrills for something that could be picked up a month later in a dollar bin at the local corner store.  So what could possibly be different about this one?

For starters, the trailer was surprisingly awesome for DTV.  Plenty of blood, quick shots of everything, enough to roll for the intrigue meter up.  My love of zombie entertainment has piqued recently thanks to The Walking Dead, so something that also injected things like robots and action into the mix seemed like a step in a good and new direction.  The robots looked simple and cheap, but having them fight zombies just screamed Snakes on a Plane or Sharknado, both of which I was caught up in and enjoyed for what they were:  stupid entertainment that didn't take itself too seriously.  And then theres Dolph, who I have a newfound respect for, thanks to The Expendables franchise, the latest Universal Soldier films, and an upcoming movie, Skin Trade, that will feature a whos who of badass genre actors, such as Tony Jaa, Michael Jai White, Peter Weller, and Ron Perlman.  The ingredients were all there, the trailer was promising, and the date came when it was time for a world premiere.

Dolph plays a private soldier-for-hire named Max Gatling (which fits the tone of what I described above to a tee), hired by a businessman to retrieve his daughter, Jude, from an infected city that has been overrun with zombies.  When hes in there, his team is taken out, and he is the lone survivor.  He finds the girl, and the group shes with, and together, they must exit the city by any means necessary.  The acting is OK at best, and about what you would expect.  Dolph isn't a terrific actor from the start, but he is the best among the subpar actors, including Matt Doran, who you may recognize as Mouse from The Matrix.  The action is quick and the camera moves along with it, shot in such a way that lets you know whats going on, but not staying on anything long enough to really satiate your appetite.  The zombie makeup is very simple, which is slightly disappointing, because it doesnt seem to take much to make some better special effects makeup.  There are violent bursts of blood and brutality, enough to keep you intrigued.  Naturally, Dolph does way more than makes sense for a man of his age to do, but remember, you are watching a movie where Dolph Lundgren is fighting zombies, so let loose the rope a little bit.  When the robots show up, it doesnt really make sense, but one of the characters makes a point to reference a nerdgasm when talking about them, which kind of hits this movie right on the head.  Dolph outfits them with guns and knives, and together, they fight their way through zombies to escape the city.  It is frustrating when you want to see more robot versus zombie, as the shots are very quick, and only glimpses of the weaponized robots and zombie gore are seen, really failing to capture the idea the way you want.  What this also does is show the obvious budgetary constraints of the DTV movie.  But, at the end of the day, its still Dolph and robots that are fighting zombies, so this is the best its going to get.",1392768000,,3445,4.574225122349103

985985,3,6305207860,"The great Dolph Lundgren plays the incredibly-named Max Gatling (a name that deserves better than this movie), survivor of a recent virus outbreak that has turned most of the world in snarling, infected zombie-like things that live only to kill and eat the living. He's hired to rescue Jude (Melanie Zanetti, Tracks), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Trouble is, Jude won't go anywhere without the other survivors with whom she's partnered upincluding her boyfriend Reese (Matt Doran, The Matrix) and Duke (David Field, Chopper), the self-appointed group leader. The bad news is that there are zombies everywhere and the good guys' numbers are dwindling. On the plus side, Max and the other survivors come across a small army of robots they're able to reprogram to fight the zombies.

Boy, on paper a movie with Dolph Lundgren and robots fighting zombies sounds like my new favorite thing. In practice, it's a different story. While Battle of the Damned isn't anywhere near Against the Dark territorya similar DVD-action-star-versus-monsters effort that pits Steven Seagal against vampires and one of the dullest, most inept action movies you're likely to seeit's also nowhere near as good as its simple premise would suggest. The characters are barely sketched; the plotting almost nonexistent. Though some of the action is well-staged, it amounts mostly to a small cast and some extras running around the empty streets of an Eastern European country. There isn't any particularly good zombie gore, either. The infected are dispatched by being shot, and their human victims are always obscured by a swarm of zombies or eaten off camera. There is no impact to any of the deaths, human or otherwise.

Besides Lundgrenwho isn't really given a character to play, just a cool sounding name and his usual larger-than-life statureno one in the movie registers. That may not be important in most action movies, but it does in one like this. When a film is focused on a small band of survivors, it's important to know who they are and how they relate to one another. Even broad sketches would go a long way towards getting us to invest in the film, because neither the action nor the horror elements are doing the job. The least we can do is care about someone, but Battle of the Damned doesn't pull that off. I guess the filmmakers hope if they throw enough robots into the mix, we'll overlook the rest of the flaws. And you know what? For a little while, that works.

Anchor Bay's Battle of the Damned (Blu-ray) delivers about what you would expect: the 1080p transfer looks very good, despite the film's washed-out, shot-on-digital appearance. Detail is present throughout, and while the HD transfer is slightly less forgiving of some of the CG robot effects, the film generally looks more expensive than its small budget would suggest. The TrueHD 5.1 audio track is also impressive, seeing as its tasked more with providing action effects and score than with dialogue, as the movie is light on conversation. Sadly, the only bonus feature included is some behind-the-scenes footage, barely cut together in any presentable way.

The DTV action market is so overcrowded with generic, hit-or-miss fare that something even remotely ambitious like Battle of the Damned falls just this side of ""ok."" Some decent special effects and the presence of Dolph Lundgren make it watchable, though it's mostly for non-discerning genre fans. Horror fans looking for a zombie movie fix will be disappointed. All that's left is us DTV action fans who have seen enough garbage to find this one enough of a change of pace to be passable. Yes, it rips off The Walking Dead. But The Walking Dead doesn't have Dolph Lundgren. Or robots.

985986,4,6305207860,"What do you get when you combine robots, zombies, and ass-kicking?  BATTLE OF THE DAMNED, a new action-thriller starring Dolph Lundgren.  These three aspects are some of my favorite things to see in a movie, so when I heard this flick was a combo of them, I knew it was a must-see.  And although its not an excellent flick, its still fun and worth checking out.

This film will add fuel to the fire in the debate between slow or fast zombies.  These biters are fast and lethal, much like those in 28 DAYS LATER.  But these zombies are actually infected people that now crave flesh.  As such, the term zombies might not actually apply.  But regardless, people should run when they see them!

The cinematography in BATTLE OF THE DAMNED is ok, but its not great.  There are several shaky action shots that will make you grit your teeth, but otherwise the camera angles are ok.  Likewise, the production value looks pretty good overall as well.  I believe this was filmed on location in Southeast Asia, so the credibility of the plot (as credible as it can be for a zombie flick) is certainly boosted by that aspect.

The action doesnt disappoint.  Lundgren, for being almost 60 years old, is still pretty physical, so the fight scenes are nothing at which to scoff.  I will confess that he constantly looks like hes in pain when he runs, though; maybe his action sequences should just involve fighting instead.  But he can bash a zombies brains out like the best of them, so he works quite well for this film.

The special effects are pretty good, as well.  Most of the zombies are only seen close-up in the fighting sequences, and even then we only get glimpses of them.  This is a good thing, because theres not much make-up used for the most part, it seems.  This works well for the way the film is shot.  The CG used for the robots is not bad, however there are a few scenes where you can definitely tell its animation.  I suppose this is a result of budget constraints.

For as much as I enjoyed it, I do have a big complaint about BATTLE OF THE DAMNED.  The killer robots seem to be thrown in as an afterthought.  The movie really wouldnt have been much different without them.  They do help the concept, I supposebut they really should have been introduced much earlier in the film.

Still, BATTLE OF THE DAMNED is a fun flick, and I recommend giving it a shot if you like Dolph Lundgren and/or low-budget action flicks.  The film will be available next week, so make a note.",1392249600,,2479,4.461024498886414

The story finds Lundgren as a paid retriever. In this case the daughter of the man responsible for the outbreak of a deadly virus in Southeast Asia. The city in which he must find her is to be firebombed at a certain point to wipe out the contagion/infected people. Lundgren puts together a team of sorts, but in short order they are decimated and he is left to do the job alone.
Dolph finds his target(Zanetti) while she is shopping in a local food mart. She takes him back to the place in which she has been residing;a huge hotel in which five others also kip down. The leader of this small group is Field who is older than the rest. He doesn't much like Lundgren being there,and Lundgren is quite tight lipped about his real mission. After Dolph accompanies the group to get petrol,and tries to steal his target away,they catch him and Field leaves him chained to a pole to die.
Back at the hotel Zanetti's boyfriend(Doran) finds out she is preggers and immediately runs to release Lundgren,realizing he is probably their only hope of rescue. He arrives in the nick of time. The two discover a roving band of robots who kill anything in the least Zombie related. They follow and eventually befriend them,with Lundgren giving them new orders and a raison d'etre. They all return to the hotel. It's leave or stay time and all agree to accompany him out.
They first reach a junk yard and stay there to regroup. Suddenly a rogue robot tears into the compound and they all must battle it AND the Zombies. Once the situation settles they leave. Field,who locked himself in an office during the melee is left behind to his own devices. The group arrive at a large parking facility. The robots are left outside to guard against any attacks while the group explores. Soon the Z's are swarming the complex and just as it appears they all might be over run, the firebombing starts in earnest. To escape being cooked alive,Doran,Zanetti and Lundgren dive into  flooded sections of the garage.
After the bombing is done the three are up on the roof talking. It is then Dolph reveals he was there not only to rescue Zanetti but to kill the man who whistle blew about the entire virus outbreak;that being Doran. After some contemplation Lundgren stands down and the three,accompanied by the last remaining robot,walk towards freedom.
Dolph turns in a not too bad performance throughout,but the script is ultimately his real enemy here. I also mentioned technical flaws. By that I meant poor editing. Many of the shots of jabs by knives,shootings or punches are held on to for far too long and one can easily tell they are totally faked, as they are no where near the intended victims. A different angle would also have alleviated this problem.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all while at times kind-of interesting, this is basically a been there,done that Zombie film. The acting is passable but the script is worse. The production crew has to practice working on their fight scenes much more to make them believable. Yet another film shot in Asia(that's where the money speaks the loudest these days-and will continue to get that much louder!),this film flies alright,but its butt is dragging on the ground.",1442016000,,3473,4.7388429752066115
