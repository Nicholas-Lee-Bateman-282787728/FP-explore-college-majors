8702956,4,B00TRPETYC,"This disc features two rehearsal sessions leading to a performance of Wagners Tannhauser Overture given by the Sudfunk S.O. (SWR Radio Symphony Orchestra) in 1966. This was the first time in seven years that Solti had conducted the orchestra. (This review was written after considering the Blu-ray option and using the earlier UK release of the multi-region disc).

There is an informative booklet which does not avoid the known dislike that many musicians in many orchestras had of the conductor finding his unbending and authoritarian manner unbearable. Descriptions such as Geog the Terrible and The Prussian, as quoted can be added to another description the Screaming Skull that will also be familiar to collectors. This dislike also extended to damage inflicted upon his car and to cabbages being thrown during concerts (booklet quote).

However, it is also the case that his methods led to impressive orchestral discipline and that focus is made clear during these rehearsals with great emphasis upon precise rhythmic control of the shorter value notes in particular. Upon that he builds greater control of dynamics and, over the course of the disc, these demands pay off in terms of orchestral tightness.

Solti clearly knew the score intimately and frequently illustrated his phrasing demands of the players by quoting the sung texts that would be sung to the instrumental themes as a means of showing what he wanted  particularly when he demands a more singing vocal line. Throughout the rehearsals he continually demonstrates this intimate knowledge of the score down to the smallest details and at the conclusion, in the concert performance, this meticulous preparation and attention to detail results in identifiable features. At no point do members of the orchestra show other than a non-committal compliance without any evidence of joy or pleasure in the business of making music.

The disc is therefore a fascinating record of this conductor at work with a group of musicians where there was not already a familiar working relationship. Whether that would be developed later with evidence of more enjoyment is simply not possible to judge.

The 1966 stereo sound and vision, presented in monochrome and 4:3 ratio, is remarkably good and far exceeds the quality which has been experienced in recording of a similar, or even a more recent, vintage. It is certainly no bar to the interest likely to be experienced by potential purchasers. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish which are easy to follow. Solti speaks in German throughout.

Overall therefore, this is a fascinating insight into the working practices of a renowned conductor and the documentary carries complete conviction that this is a faithful record of such an occasion. It is certainly a document that anyone interested in conductors and conducting would benefit from considering.",1429401600,4,3244,5.214971209213052
