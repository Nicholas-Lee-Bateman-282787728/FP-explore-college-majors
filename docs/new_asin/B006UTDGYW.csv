8504767,2,B006UTDGYW,"Splintered (Simeon Halligan, 2010)

You have seen this movie at least a dozen times. Innocent, or maybe not so innocent but she's certainly done nothing to deserve this, girl is abducted by someone or something and imprisoned. There is someone close by who may or may not be able to help her, but is useful for passing information through to the captive (and, by extension, to the viewers). There is a Big Reveal about the killer, and often whether the viewer is left with a good taste in his or her mouth about the movie turns on whether that Big Reveal works. (I'm not sure it did here, I don't think this movie could have been saved one way or the other.) It's a well-established framework that lazy scriptwriters insert characters into for an almost instantly-completed movie. The end result, given that you are using a well-established framework, is utterly predictable and very rarely worth your time. Such is the case with Splintered. *",1409788800,,943,4.75
8504768,5,B006UTDGYW,"I'm usually picky when it comes to movies like this, it almost seemed like a carbon copy of 'Wrong Turn' and other type of cannibalism movies. This however, for some reason, was better than I expected. The acting was pretty solid and actress Holly Weston sold me as a lead in a horror movie.

Throughout the movie, it was varied with dull moments and chases but all in all, that's what you come to expect in almost 95% of horror movies since 1990. Overall, this movie is a solid B+ for me personally.",1407628800,,500,4.376344086021505
8504769,3,B006UTDGYW,"With a badly written screenplay and filmmaking with some clichd elements, Splintered (2010) is a thriller where things just seem to slide downhill, and while not a complete disaster, this is a movie that features very little intelligent behavior.  Some spoilers follow.

The film opens with Sophie, a little girl being traumatized by something unknown, and then jumps forward to the present, where someplace in north Wales, a grown Sophie (Holly Weston) and four other college-age students are in the woods looking to do some camping.  Also along are Sophie's friend Jane (Sadie Pickering), Jane's boyfriend Sam (Sacha Dhawn), Jane's brother Dean (Jonathan Readwin), and John (Sol Heras).

Sophie is interested getting some evidence about a mysterious beast that has been attacking farm animals.  After making camp, the group is settling in for the night, when Sophie sees something in the woods, and goes off with John to investigate.  They eventually find St. Joseph's, a huge estate in the middle of the woods.  They enter the abandoned facility, and find signs of a slaughtered lamb.  Something comes out of the dark, and Sophie knocks herself unconscious running away.  She wakes up locked in a room, being held prisoner by a strange dwarfish man named Gavin (Stephen Walters).

Sophie makes several attempts to escape, and although she does some intelligent things, she somehow manages to mess up.  Sophie's friends, also stumble across St. Josephs, which is actually an abandoned church.  John encounters a priest named Father Thomas (Colin Tierney), and they also arrive at the church, for the dramatic climax.

Given how silly and annoying she is, it's rather difficult to get behind Sophie, who makes noises or screaming at just the wrong time, and isn't much help when others are in danger.  Truthfully, the sloppy writing doesn't put any of the actors in a very good light, although Stephen Walters puts a lot of energy into his performance.

The story has a clichd religious aspect, with Father Thomas conveniently showing up, intending to commit murder.  Another familiar ploy, is featuring an actor in a dual role.  There are also flashbacks and dream sequences, which serve mostly to confuse and mislead, as Splintered never intends to present a clear story.  The point is simply to place the characters in peril, and then kill them off, with suspense taking precedence over rational behavior.

Spooky St. Joseph's makes a great location, although it could have been utilized better.  A nighttime rooftop chase scene falls short in the execution, but at least it's an attempt at something visually striking.  The film does have a few decent ideas, but they are forced together into a story that doesn't make much sense.  A twist at the end isn't exactly a surprise, although the ferocity of the violence might be.  Splintered is a muddled mess that is hard to recommend to anyone, except hardcore gore fans, as the filmmakers don't give the audience much credit for intelligence.

Shot using a Red camera, the Bluray seems to offer a slight improvement in image quality over the DVD.  Both formats each have the same extras, a making of featurette, and deleted scenes with an alternate ending that isn't an improvement.  The deleted scenes indicate how much story and character development was sacrificed, to produce a story that was more raw and ambiguous.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1346025600,,3393,5.055755395683454
8504770,2,B006UTDGYW,"In this most nonsensical scare story, a group of Cockney teens goes monster-hunting in the wilds of North Wales (how this comes about is left largely unexplained).  But instead of finding monsters, which we're led to believe are somehow a wolfen manifestation of one of the teen's repressed childhood memories, our ever-bickering and beer-drinking fivesome stumbles onto an abandoned boys' school populated by two feral brothers-- one a drooling cannibal, the other just suffering from incredibly bad hygiene (although he's no slouch in the drool department, either).  There is a priest who appears out of nowhere to provide some exposition; a fair amount of gore as the teens are killed off one by one; gratuitous cat-and-mouse hijinks among the school's sepulchral halls as we try to figure out who's committing the killings; and a lengthy third-act denouement 'narrated' by the kinder, more articulate backwoodsman through which we are given the rather lame genesis of his bitey brother's condition.  If I've missed anything, it's because I was distracted by my jaw hitting the floor continously at the multitude of tired, dead-end tropes and perfunctory twists thrown in during the film's final twenty minutes.  The only worthwhile question that lingers after sitting through 'Splintered' is: where in the hell does the title come from?  1 1/2 stars for some spooky sets and photography.",1338508800,,1391,5.276018099547511
8504771,4,B006UTDGYW,"I'm a huge fan of old-school horror cinema. Franchises like FRIDAY THE 13th and HALLOWEEN entertain the hell out of me. I love the slasher genre, how those films take elements of Noir cinema, such as the damsel in distress and the mysterious killer, and give them a gore upgrade. I love the suspense, the twists and turns, the hack and slash: all of it works for me.

SPLINTERED, the first feature-length production by co-writer and director, Simeon Halligan, is by this definition old-school horror. It's a final girl movie. The set-up is familiar: five teenage friends go to the woods where a mysterious killer is known to lurk. One of the five, troubled goth Sophie, finds herself isolated and must confront her fears - as well as the ghosts of her past - in order to survive.

But there's more to SPLINTERED than meets the eye. The story flirts with a variety of tropes within the horror genre, from werewolf mythology to rape revenge. It feels very much like a film made by fans of horror for fans of horror; paying homage to the genre as much as being a strong entry in its own right.

Famed as the first UK production to use the new Red Camera technology, SPLINTERED has the look and feel of a movie that vastly exceeds its budget. The children's home where most of the action takes place provides an eerie moonlit set, albeit at times a little on the dark side to make out what's happening onscreen. Action sequences are slick and tense. Special effects are solid, use of CGI subtle and effective.

Holly Weston puts in a great performance as our leading lady. Development of the remaining cast, with the notable exception of Stephen Martin Walters' antagonist, may be light, but it's Sophie's emotionally charged journey that drives this story towards its conclusion, and the payoff is both powerful and rewarding.

The bottom line: SPLINTERED is an entertaining slasher film, packing an emotional punch more powerful than many of its peers.",1335052800,,1950,4.740412979351032
8504772,3,B006UTDGYW,"The movie opens with a scene of a young girl alone in her bedroom. The moonlight shines bright through the window. The house is old and is decorated with religious pictures and symbols. There is a creature at the door. It has the low growl of a lion. The girl is afraid and hides under the bed as the animal comes into the room. Its claws lunge at her under the bed, then finally grab her and drag her out. She screams and awakes. It was all a dream. I liked the opening scene and the subsequent credit roll.

We find out the girl's name is Sophie (Holly Weston). She is a young adult and still has bad dreams. There has been some killings by some unknown animal. Sophie and 4 others decide they want to capture the animal...on film. She is obsessed with werewolves and appears to be a frigid virgin. Sam (Sacha Dhawan) is the far too frank skeptic who supplies us with internal conflict within the group. Jane (Sadie Pickering) is his girlfriend and considers herself to be a soul mate of the aloof moody Sophie. John (Sol Heras) is Sophie's boyfriend (I feel your pain). Dean (Jonathan Readwin) is the fifth wheel, brother to Jane, has a digital movie camera.

Eventually, following a trail, Sophie finds an abandoned building that looks like a large mental hospital, where beauty winds up as prisoner of the beast's psycho keeper, a wild eyed man who talks to himself (Stephen Walters). Sophia (named for the goddess of wisdom) is resourceful and clever.

The movie starts out like it is going to be a great offbeat werewolf film and then digresses into a psycho slasher movie. There are some twists at the end that were slightly developed, but you don't realize it at the time. Good job by Holly Weston. Decent story line but couldn't properly be told in 90 minutes.

F-bomb, brief nudity (Holly Weston), no sex.",1332547200,,1816,4.54434250764526
