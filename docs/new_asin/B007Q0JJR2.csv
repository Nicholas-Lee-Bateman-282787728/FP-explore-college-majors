8520926,5,B007Q0JJR2,"Wonderful old movie.  I love the Boston Blackie radio shows and have a couple of the other films with Chester Morris as Blackie.  These movies try to stay true to the radio/print versions of Blackie's adventures and don't overdo the comedy,  I prefer Chester Morris over Kent Taylor as Blackie, that's me.

If you enjoy old movies and have ever listened to Boston Blackie on the radio, then this needs to be in your collection.",1424563200,,427,4.653333333333333

8520928,5,B007Q0JJR2,"Great to see another `Boston Blackie' released and an excellent transfer.  Looked great projected on a 100""inch screen.

A little out of the ordinary with Blackie working with Inspector Faraday.  Good story with enough plot to keep your interest for the full 61 minutes.

More please Sony Pictures.",1337299200,10,298,5.145833333333333
