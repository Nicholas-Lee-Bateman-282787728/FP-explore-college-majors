7927391,5,B00004YKSH,I can only describe this movie in three words because it would be enough to sum it all up: I love it!,1366329600,,101,3.6363636363636362
7927392,3,B00004YKSH,"I had very high expectations from this movie. First its the reason why I signed up to amazon, couldn't find Swordsman I anywhere after falling in love with Swordsman II. Plus Iv'read all the feedback in here and people are saying things like ""action every 15 minutes"" hmmm... maybe quantity is good, but quality is much better. Anyway, not enough swordsfight, and when one happens its too short.
Like another viewer says, this movie helps u understand SwordsmanII better, might be the only valuable reason to see it.. and i miss jet Li :(",1084752000,3,538,4.73404255319149
7927393,4,B00004YKSH,"For some reason, this movie has always seemed to polarize opinion (when people could actually find a copy-- it's been notoriously hard to find until now).  People either love it or hate it.  After recently viewing the DVD, I'm leaning toward the former camp.
The plot revolves around various parties attempting to recover a scroll that contains a powerful martial arts technique.  It's as simple as that, really, and the complexity of the plot stems from the fact that there isn't always a clear line between the good guys and the bad guys-- with the exception of the aptly-named ""Laughing Swordsman,"" the central character of a series of novels upon which this film was based.  And I always considered depth of character to be a GOOD thing in a movie.
All told, there really isn't a lot to distinguish this from a typical (typically solid, that is) Hong Kong actioner.  However, the notable feature is that it involved no fewer than four directors.  Getting top billing is the legendary King Hu, although the better-known Tsui Hark has made an obvious mark.  While too many cooks usually spell disaster for a movie, this feels like a genuinely cooperative effort.  Hu's eye for atmosphere, color and photography is apparent, while Hark keeps the action sequences looking dynamic and tense.  It adds up, amazingly, to an admirable directorial job.
Another asset of the film is its willingness to be dark.  Some of the most memorable Hong Kong films feature villains that are really worthy of the viewer's hatred (The Heroic Trio, for one), and there are some vicious scenes in this film.  To me, that added to the overall effect.
No, it's not a slapdash story.  No, it isn't the mess it could have been, and no, it isn't non-stop wirework and fake action.  Swordsman might not earn itself a place as a genuine classic of Hong Kong cinema, but it's a strong effort that's well worth a look-- not only for its historical pairing of several famous directors (let's not forget Ching Siu Tung), but because it's genuinely entertaining.",1078531200,13,2030,4.815561959654179
7927394,3,B00004YKSH,"This is the first in a series of at least 3 movies about warrior clans in China, based on the novels of Jin Yong.  This film has the most coherent  plot of the three (which is not saying much), and gives a lot of useful  background information for Swordsman II.
The second film, however, is by  far the best in the series, with Jet Li taking on the lead role.  If you  want to understand what's going on in Swordsman II, watch this one first  (or read Jin Yong's novels).  If you just want to get straight to the  ""essence absorbing stance"" and Brigitte Lin blowing people up  using sewing needles, you can safely skip this one.  It's still an  enjoyable movie in its own right, falling somewhere between 3 and 4 stars  from my perspective.",969408000,7,740,4.352941176470588
