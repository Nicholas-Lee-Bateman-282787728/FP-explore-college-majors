I got to watch this with my Dad who was dying and we had a conversation that will never leave me.  Don't wait for a discount version - invest your heart in this now.  I won't give it away, but let's just say it makes you believe God does redeem in our lifetime, and salvation is more than a promise on the future - it is a way of life.",1268092800,4,454,3.902173913043478
