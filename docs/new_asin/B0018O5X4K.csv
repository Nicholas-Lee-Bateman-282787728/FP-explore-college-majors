8270200,5,B0018O5X4K,"The movie is very informative and easy to comprehend, has both sides of the story. Just a bit of political misconduct is exposed. Interviews of former athletes and their trainers, as well as specialists in doping and microbiology, are included. Doping side effects are listed but no in-depth breakdown of chemical reactions. Hence, the film is easy to watch. The 53 minute movie is about innocent, teenage German athletes doped with synthetic male hormones/steroids in the 1970's and 1980's, and what life changing effects followed.",1311120000,,532,5.270588235294118
8270201,5,B0018O5X4K,"The crumbling of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist rule in East Germany brought to the spotlight a sordid story of bizarre science, untested steroids and a government's drive to dominate Olympic sports, no matter the price that would later be paid by young athletes.

With a special focus on the women's swimming and track & field teams that burst into dominance on the world scene in the 1970s, the incredibly powerful documentary explores the East German sports machine and the quest for domination through the use of steroid ""therapy"" on athletes as young as age 12. Included are the grand triumphs and sickening tragedies associated with a program that used the emerging superstars as guinea pigs and what ultimately happened to athletes when they were no longer of any use on the international stage as their bodies broke down from the illicit drugs. Many of the competitors had no knowledge that they were being ""juiced"" while on the national/international teams and family members were strongly dissuaded by team officials from asking tough questions.

The interviews with physicians in the program are especially chilling and the different opinions from former athletes are particularly amazing; there are some who are unrepentant about their accomplishments - no matter how tainted - and remain bitter at their brethren who pursued real answers for health problems attributed to the covert experiments. Several who spoke out have not only been ostracized by former teammates, but have had their achievements erased from the record books. The shadows from the past have not faded away in a unified Germany.

Documents don't lie and neither does the carnage associated with the quest to build the perfect specimen who would battle for supremacy when gold medals were a priceless tool during the Cold War.",1249171200,3,1823,5.1313131313131315
