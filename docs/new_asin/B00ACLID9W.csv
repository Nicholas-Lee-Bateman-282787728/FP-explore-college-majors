8550011,5,B00ACLID9W,"""Underbelly: Badness"" is the first of the true crime franchise to focus on one individual, specifically, convicted murderer Anthony Perish. Subsequently, it is a shorter series than its four predecessors as it contains eight episodes, but it is hard hitting and fantastic.

Jonathan LaPaglia was ferociously brilliant as Perish and his performance was arguably his best on the Australian screen. Likewise, Matt Nable was superb as Detective Sargent Gary Jubelin and he presented Jubelin as innovative, determined and a truly dedicated police officer.

The events in the series may cause some viewers to be dislodged from their seats such is the level of callousness from Perish and his two main offsiders, but the viewer can take some comfort knowing the New South Wales Police never gave up, and this series pays worthy tribute to those painstaking efforts.

8550012,4,B00ACLID9W,"My review is of the actual series- as 'Underbelly: Badness' was aired originally in the US on DirecTV's AUDIENCE network, and NOT of the DVD set. This is because for some reason, the DVD is currently only released in Region 4 format, and not in Region 1 where I live.

Regardless, this is an amazing series (I own the first 3 series on Region 1 DVD's) that rivals AMC's 'The Walking Dead' or HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire' (2 of my other favorites) in terms of story and substance. Just hard-edged, brutal storytelling. LOVE it!

'Underbelly: Badness' has amazing acting, excellent storytelling, and respectable production value. The season in summary is the police strike force TUNO attempting to catch and lock up the bad guy- who in this series is a really, really bad dude that exists ""off the grid"".

If you like grit, if you liked the HBO's 'Sopranos', or FX's 'The Shield', or even the two shows that I mentioned above...you will do yourself a great service to check this show out.

The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is because, IMO, the ending was a bit of a let-down considering this tremendous build up all season long. However, with it being based on actual events I have overlooked that and still rate it a 'can't miss'!",1381017600,,1233,4.590909090909091
