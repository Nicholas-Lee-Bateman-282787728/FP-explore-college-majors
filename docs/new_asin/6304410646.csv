862101,5,6304410646,"I'm so glad this film is out on DVD! I first saw it on cable a couple of years ago, and can't resist watching it every time it is shown. Like all classic movies, ""Caught"" holds your interest from beginning to end. Its is both genuinely sexy and suspensful, as well as a fascinating portrait of a family stretched to its limits. How refreshing to see a film where such intelligence and artistry was put into the script. The acting is first rate all around. The chemistry between Maria Conchita Alonso and Arie Verveen is incredible, and Steven Schub gives a remarkable performance as the edgy son. Olmos is flawless as the husband. Such a great movie.  I recommend it highly!",1059436800,5,674,4.570247933884297
862102,5,6304410646,"""Caught"" caught me by surprise. It was so brilliantly executed and the cast was magnetic. It kept me on the edge of my seat from the beautiful under water opening to the chilling end.

862104,5,6304410646,"I didn't even know this film existed until I ran across it on the Bravo channel; it is a real find.
Although it is indeed a variation on The Postman Always Rings Twice, it certainly stands up on its own rights.
The  acting performanes are all excellent and the film is filled with suspense;  the ending is not entirely predictable either",948585600,7,337,4.508196721311475

862161,5,6304410646,Equal to Lolita with Jeremy Irons.  Tragic story excellently told.  Each character exquisitely portrayed.  Consider it a classic masterpiece worth seeing more than once.

862164,4,6304410646,"This one was a real sleeper--I don't remember hearing much about this when it was out but is really is not bad.  You have read the plot as described by others, it will keep you glued to the screen.  But the real reason to watch this is to see the absolutely gorgeous Maria Conchita Alonso in the starring role.  She is featured throughout the movie, and she really shines in this one.",1338595200,,384,4.305555555555555
862165,5,6304410646,"This movie will stick in your mind and heart!  I had to buy it after I rented it!!  The story, the actors, the emotions evoked, and Chris Botti's amazing score are all unforgettable.  Tired of the same old movies?  Try this one!",1253059200,,228,4.357142857142857
862166,5,6304410646,"From beginning to end, I was Caught!! If you remember Edward James Olmos from his days on Miami Vice, or the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso from The Running Man, you won't be disappointed. What drew me to this film is the obvious chemistry between Olmos, Alonso, and Verveen. There were parts of the film that kinda dragged on, until the affair and the arrival of Danny. The ending was tragic, but how many of you wanted to know whatever happened to Danny after what he did to Nick? If you're looking for a night cap movie, you won't be disappointed.",1245628800,,548,4.49
862167,5,6304410646,"I would love to own this movie and its a shame that I do not. I remember seeing this at the movie theater with a group of friends and...it was brilliant.  It was well written, well acted...I mean, the ""footsie"" scene alone I remember everybody in the movie theater gasping.  It was one of those movies you were glad to see it on the big screen and appreciate going through the story with other people. Absolutely two thumbs up.",1236643200,2,427,4.3924050632911396
862168,5,6304410646,"good plot-beautiful,exotic, love scenes. A husband that takes his wife

862277,5,6304410646,"A transient, feckless and reckless 'prey', stumbles into another 'world.' One one side, a world of decency, endeavour, honesty, trust, and, loyalty. On the other, one of unbridled desire; caused by chemistry, aura, dynamics, and, sensuality, placing, both the 'hunted' and the 'hunter' upon a collision course with destiny. Amongst them all, the 'hunter's' evil offspring, an Iago-figure, resentful of, the 'object of his desire' longing for someone representing all that was pure and decent (the 'hunted') rather than, the 'unacceptable' (Oedipus Rex is seen rearing his ugly head, throughout the film) the untenable, the vile. Sad tale, with an even sadder conclusion. The 'hunter' and the 'hunted' were (to quote from William Shakespeare) none other than, ""star crossed lovers, who had loved, perhaps not wisely, but, well."" The sexually-pulsating performance of a Cuban-born, Swiss Finishing School educated Venezuelan (Ms Maria Conchita Alonso) and a Dubliner with a Dutch name (Mr Arie Verveen) is absolutely electrifying. As for the East Los Angeles-born Edward James Olmos, I first had the privilege of seeing him star in ""The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez."" One highly-polished Performer, possessing the acting ablity of a Richard Burton, and, John Barrymore. Combined.",1207353600,,1274,5.538461538461538

862279,5,6304410646,"Brilliant script and very well acted by everyone in this movie!  I don't know how this movie didn't get more publicity at the time, possibly because it didn't have big box office names, but for everyone who loves an intriguing story, this is one not to miss.  This movie will stay with you long after the credits are rolling.  Excellent doesn't cover it, the movie is brilliant.",1178409600,2,378,4.611940298507463

862281,4,6304410646,"The story is about a drifter who is taken in by a middle age couple. The threesome's relationship becomes complex and twisted. To make matters worse their grown son comes back to see the drifter has taken his room and a place in the family. The son is strange and the situation goes from bad to worse.

If that sounds vague, it's because I done want to give up the plot. This movie has a good plot and acting. I highly recommend it!",1154995200,2,432,4.204819277108434
862282,5,6304410646,"I saw this movie ages ago at the video store, rented it, and was blown away.  It's one of those films that reminds you never to cheat on your spouse!  But like another reviewer said, the wife's son is so wicked that you can't help but blame him for the family's demise.  The wife and lover happen into this affair naturally-- how could they resist?

This chilling family picnic is the most memorable scene.

This is a great indie film that reminds you not to act on every desire because there are prices to pay.

One of the few 5 star films.  If you see it, you'll agree how good it it.  It is dumbfounding how a movie like this is so unheard of.  I wonder what other films are out there that are awesome that I don't know about.

(One False Move and Bound are two movies not a lot of people have seen that are excellent too!)",1124755200,22,826,4.138364779874214
862283,5,6304410646,"""Caught"" is an Independent movie filled with  so much sin that the viewer will feel as if, they too, should ask for forgiveness--

Arie Verveen as the drifter whom appears to be at the wrong place at the wrong time--or if one values adultery, lies, and deception, the right place at the right time.

(Maria Chonchita Alonso) is superb as the gorgeous seductress--The older woman whom leaves (Edward James Olmoes) snoring in bed as she wraps her still beautiful body around the younger man. The sex is so wild it is a wonder Olmoes did not hear them--in the shower, closet, bathroom.

But--to me, the most brilliant role is played by Alonso's son--Steven Schub.  There is something so absolutely wicked about him, so evil, the viewer will blame him for the trangressions of the family, instead of the mother.

During a picnic, he sticks his feet in his mother's lap pretending to be her lover--she does not know this until her lover stands to stretch--The look on Alonso's face is unbelievably cold as she rips his feet off of her skirt...

One can only walk with the devil so long--but soon his long nails scratch, destroy, and kill. The sins of the mother will cause the entire family to catch fire, and there is no stopping the flames once they are ignited.

Hell is waiting around the corner...

***One of the most intelligent,astonishing Independent films I've watched in a long time***

 Highly recommended****",1092700800,15,1415,4.7818930041152266
862284,5,6304410646,"This is an intense and believable erotic-thriller about a couple - perfectly cast with Edward James Olmos and Maria Conchita Alonso - whose world is rocked by the virtual adoption of a stranger, the return of their twisted son and an opportunity to sell their fish store for a $1 million.
A great story, top notch direction by Robert Young and absolutely superb acting from the entire cast.  Most memorable is the stellar performance by Steven Schub as the estranged, Oedipal and borderline psychotic son.  Clearly a `method' actor extraordinaire, it is frightening to imagine what he must have gone through personally (he can't be like that in real life!?!) to prepare for this role.
Who is this Steven Schub and what else has he been in?  It is immensely gratifying that at least occasionally Hollywood casts a real actor and gives us a freakin' break from humdrum Matt Damon and pretty boy Ben Affleck - aarrrgh.  Hey Kevin Smith, hey Scorsese, find this Schub guy and sign him up!",1059696000,12,984,4.770588235294118
862285,5,6304410646,"The Postman can just keep on ringing because I am caught by CAUGHT-a movie which unfortunately slipped under the radar when originally released except for Janet Maslin's rave in the NY Times. Now out on DVD, it is an enter-taining sexual thriller set in the worlds of fish markets and standup comedy that rewards repeat viewing with it's subtle layers of complexity.  After ten times, I am still finding something new. While the film works as a Cain-like sexy thriller, it also aspires to a higher level of exploration of the human heart as the writer, director and cast reveal the desire and pain of richly-portrayed characters.  Maria's great and Olmos is too, but my favorite is Steve Schub whose amazing performance as Danny Dime should have advanced him to the A-list.  Everyone should demand to see more of this talented young actor.  Meanwhile, if you are looking for a great new dvd, just cast your fish net out and catch CAUGHT.",1059523200,10,937,4.765432098765432

Maria Conchita Alonso is beautiful as always and shows off her acting chops too.  Edward James Olmos turns in his usual excellent performance.  The younger actors are good but could have benefited from a better story and direction.

I thought it was good and thought-provoking.  Anyone thinking about committing adultery should watch this movie!  It may cause them to think twice!
