8087842,5,B000BKEOBK,"The video tells the story of a pioneer in the development of Puerto Rican arts in the US. The life history of Mr. Thomas is a case study of courage and resolve to struggle against racism and other maladies affecting immigrants, and this case, Puerto Ricans who moved north during the 1940s and 1950s.

The video is very well made. The work of Piri is well weaved into the fabric of the story and becomes a wonderful tool for younger audiences who may think that they have impossible dreams.",1168300800,,490,4.50561797752809
8087843,5,B000BKEOBK,"This beautifully constructed film was made quite recently about the life of SF Bay Area Hero to Many,  Piri Thomas.  It contains dramatization about his life and the fight he had within himself about his color in the United States- being a darker skinned, mixed race Puerto Rican at a time when to be Puerto Rican could mean that you were an honorary white.  Piri isn't young any more so the film focuses on his compassion which radiates on screen, rather than his misdeeds which were many if you read ""down these mean streets"" the now classic autobiography set in the Harlem of the 50's written during and after his stint in prison.
