8198777,5,B000R4FUJU,"As a parent, you never really want to think about the prospect of dying before your children, but part of being a good parent is preparing for those unthinkable possibilities. We know about creating wills and the importance of choosing guardians for our loved ones, but what about those families that have special needs children... the gravity and the importance of preparing for their future becomes more significant and takes on an even greater challenge. This DVD answers all the questions parents may have when dealing with this unique situation.  It is very helpful and informative.  I think any parent or family member who loves and cares about a special needs child should see this film.",1312156800,,694,4.974137931034483
