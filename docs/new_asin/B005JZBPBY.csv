8476159,3,B005JZBPBY,"Interesting film, but the first 3 films were all about Jews. Well done, but I was a bit surprised about the lack of diversity. The 4th film, Malena, was Italian, in Italian and subtitled. I'm still learning a lot about multi-films on one DVD. Miramax productions are usually of good quality with well-known actors.",1370649600,4,314,4.833333333333333
