3144963,2,B0015I2SMO,THIS MOVIE BEING HARD TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH SUB TITLES... REALLY HAS NO POINT ..NO EMOTIONAL VALUE AT ALL UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING SICKENED WHEN AN OLDER MAN FALLS IN LOVE WITH A 13 YEAR OLD GIRL.,1367539200,,192,4.216216216216216
3144964,4,B0015I2SMO,"The recent films from Germany that I've seen, have been for the most part truly amazing. This is something that's been mostly missing somewhat, since the heyday of the German new-wave of the 70's and early 80's. This unassuming entry from 2006 ""Sommer '04"" (""Summer '04"") directed by Stefan Krohmer, was no exception. Our film is about a nice married couple 'Miriam' (Martina Gedeck ""Das leben der anderen"" 2006, ""Der Baader Meinhof komplex"" 2008) and 'Andre' (Peter Davor), who are on summer holiday with their son 'Nils' and his 12 year old girlfriend 'Livia' (Svea Lohde). Their plans were to basically just enjoy sailing along the fjords of the Schlei (between the North and the Baltic Sea). When one day a stranger appears 'Bill' (Canadian-born Robert Seeliger), who develops a close bond with precocious yet sensitive 'Livia'. But don't worry this is not a 'Lolita' tale, it is so much more. For one thing the acting by the entire cast, but especially the gifted Martina Gedeck and the young Svea Lohde were excellent. It was low-key, yet very forceful. They really seemed to be ordinary and normal people on summer vacation, until things began to slowly unravel. This film, like a lot of the other new German films, is free of all the stereotypes and stupid nonsense that the average person has come to expect. It always kept you guessing even to the very end, on what did this tangled web really mean. I have not given anything away other than to say, this was an intelligent film by a bright and dedicated team that offers a refreshing twist on unexpected outcomes. Superb, and well worth it! The DVD picture quality by Kock Lorber Films was excellent. NTSC format, German (English subtitles), NR 97 mins.

3144965,4,B0015I2SMO,"The stranger in this German flick is an American actor who speaks decent German. He woos a 13-year-old girl, then woos her boyfriend's mother in a love triangle that goes awry. Beautifully shot in the German countryside, this film is a lean examination of motives and intents and what happens when expectations are not met. Way better than the average Hollywood adult melodrama.",1245196800,6,378,5.015873015873016

8258585,2,B0015I2SMO,Meandering and strange. Too slow even for a foreign independent movie.,1489536000,,70,5.454545454545454
8258586,4,B0015I2SMO,"Easy to overlook this straightforward, but compelling movie from underrated Germany among the tens of thousands of choices on Amazon instant video.

The female lead, Martina Gedeck, is simply brilliant in this film. She is strong, yet vulnerable at times.

Without revealing any spoilers, you really sympathize for her character and the difficult position she finds herself in.

The movie is helped by a strong and talented supporting cast.

We enjoyed the movie as it made you think and isn't mere fluff...

Well worth an evening! Recommend!

Enjoy!",1454371200,,550,5.193181818181818
8258587,3,B0015I2SMO,"Idk I was pretty bored most of the time through it. also one thing i rly don't get is why do all germans love sailing? the pedophilia everyone is complaining about it ACTUALLY called ephebophilia (thx Wikipedia lol) but its like not gross they don't show sex w a kid or anything lol. i felt bad for the dad tho. wasn't the worst movie i've seen but not the best either, would probably liked it more if it was in english so i couldve played on my phone or something cause it wasn't that good",1453075200,,490,4.168421052631579
8258588,2,B0015I2SMO,"The story line was not great and the characters were not that believable,
I am not sure if the writers know how to write a good plot",1374364800,,132,3.925925925925926
8258589,3,B0015I2SMO,"The description on Amazon of this movie is not how I would describe the characters or their motivations.  The focus of the movie is an all too typical middle aged woman, bored with her husband and family, who uses a precocious 12 year old as an excuse to rediscover her youth and move on.  Terribly contrived at the end to find a resolution to an uninspiring plot.",1373414400,,364,4.417910447761194
8258590,4,B0015I2SMO,I really liked it.  I thought it had a great twist at the end that ties everything together and blows you away.,1371945600,,111,4.045454545454546
8258591,3,B0015I2SMO,"It is a good ""exercise movie"" (movie to watch on the treadmill), but has some leaps in the plot that seem a little rough and out of synch with the otherwise good production values. There is a ironic surprise at the end, so stick with it.",1371340800,,237,4.173913043478261
8258592,4,B0015I2SMO,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, having seen only a handful of German films previously.  It's worth watching: it is deeply humanistic and runs counter to many of the stereotypes you might expect.",1370908800,,207,4.75
8258593,3,B0015I2SMO,"Reasonably good acting and plot.  Subtitles are a necessary distraction. Watched it free, would not recommend paying a rental fee.",1370649600,,130,5.5
