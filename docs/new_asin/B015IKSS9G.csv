8733722,3,B015IKSS9G,"Retromedia has dug up a couple more of obscure European B-film offerings from the 1950's and 1960's.
Continuing the German tradition of adapting the crime novels of Bryan Edgar Wallace, ""The Racetrack Murders"" (1964) is unfortunately a mediocre, tedious and way overlong mystery drama. The dubbing of the German actors is okay and there are some inventive camera angles by cinematographer Richard Angst but the story as directed by Franz-Josef Gottlieb is too pedestrian and the film rambles on with little style and a confusing and implausible plot (or did I just lose interest?).  Gottlieb was previously represented in an earlier Retromedia combo: the equally inept ""Curse of the Yellow Snake""  and the reasonably good ""Phantom of Soho"" (Edgar Wallace Collection Volume Two).
Second billing in this pack is the interesting, well acted and more than decent British B: ""The House in the Woods"".  This was the first film made at the new St. John's Wood Studios in London's West End in 1957 by The Film Workshop headed by Dennis Sands and Maxwell  Munden who had previously specialized in documentaries for 10 years and now under The Film Storytellers banner were venturing into B
 features.
""The House in the Woods"", written and directed by Munden from a Walter C. Brown short story is a creepy little thriller, barely running 60 minutes, telling of a novelist and his wife who seek solitude in the very isolated  country house of a murderer.  The three actors, Patricia Roc, Ronald Howard and Michael Gough are all very good and Munden keeps our interest with an adequate amount of suspense as we know murder is in the mix and about to happen at any moment.  An added bonus is the sinister theme of Larry Adler's harmonica with his ""Fantasy of Lost Love"" composition.
With a bigger budget and a bit more flair this snappy little film could have been a minor gem.
Here's hoping Retromedia continue delving into the vaults and discovering more curiosities, good and bad.",1450137600,5,1969,4.909638554216867
