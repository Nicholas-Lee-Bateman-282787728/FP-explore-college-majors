8075661,5,B000A7LR7S,"I just saw the edited version of this movie on the ""Bounce"" Channel. OMG. D.L. Hugley blew me away as a dramatic actor. He was so real and moving in his performance. The script is great and the way the movie was shot gave me chills. It used a split screen in some scenes to show how one decision affects another. I am buying this movie so I can see the unedited version.",1335657600,,370,4.082191780821918
8075662,5,B000A7LR7S,"I was totally bowled over by this film. It takes you into a very different reality, without sensationalising the very dark world of prison life.

From the writer's talent for getting inside so many diverse psyches to the wonder of seeing D.L. Hughley transition so beautifully into a dramatic role......this is a must-see!",1129420800,4,322,5.0754716981132075
8075663,5,B000A7LR7S,"With Oscar winning performances on well structured writing, Shackles is a must see! Is not each one of our lives lived in the frame-work of a question?",1127865600,2,151,4.62962962962963
8075664,4,B000A7LR7S,"Although it's pretty hard to imagine
Hughly in a serious dramatic role,
he actually does a good job.
I really didn't expect very much
when I rented this film, but I'm
proud to say that I was wrong.
This is an enjoyable view inside
the life of fallen educator and
his subsequent attempts to rebuild
his life and that of his inmate students.
The parallels between Hughly and
his troubled prized pupil, Gabriel,
is the main theme of the film.
The ending is tragic, but the story
is entertaining and heartwarming.
Hughly occasionally reverts back
to the comic that we know and love,
but he manages to pull off a convincing
dramatic portrayal.",1127692800,4,638,4.654867256637168
8075665,5,B000A7LR7S,"I saw the Shackles premiere at the Tribeca Film Fest this year and I can not say enough about it.

Anybody who watches comedy central will know DL Hughley....great comedian, hilarious guy. But reading the synopsis for this movie will immeadiately tell you that it is by no means a funny movie. Nevertheless, he plays the role perfectly and easily was one of the best performances I had seen in a while.

As for the rest of the movie, amazing acting all around to go with a very well shot film. The acting by the inmates is realistic. The scenarios too are realistic and is what you would expect to see in an actual juvenile prison fight. If you did't catch it at Tribeca or can't find a theater THEN BUY THIS MOVIE.",1122768000,11,715,4.368421052631579
