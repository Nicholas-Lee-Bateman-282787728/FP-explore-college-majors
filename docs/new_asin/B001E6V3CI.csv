8296894,3,B001E6V3CI,"I had a 1/2"" video tape of this animated short that I accidentally taped off cable while taping another movie.  I really enjoyed it and thought that it was an ideal vehicle to give children an introduction to the history of movies.  At just around 8 minutes, it does not go into a great deal of detail, especially when you consider that it starts with the invention of the camera obscura in the middle ages.  Although the animation is nothing special, it does tell its story in a light and humorous way.  The content does not justify the price.",1350950400,,544,4.4646464646464645
