The name of the group is Wylde Green and they are great performers.  Besides the great and fun traditional music (mixed with a couple of modern pieces) you also get a video tour of Ireland revealing all of its beauty.

This is definitely worth owning.  My problem is I gave my copy to my father believing it would not be difficult to purchase another one, much to my disappointment Amazon has not had any available for quite a while.  Anyway, whenever they are available again I am going to buy a few of them.

You can play the DVD with or without the words.  I play the DVD when walking on the treadmill, and it's great. It would be fun to play during a St. Patty's day party too.",1231027200,2,337,3.926470588235294
