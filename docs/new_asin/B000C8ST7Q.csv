8096257,4,B000C8ST7Q,"The dvd came in great quality and shipped fast. The movies themselves were ok, just kinda wierd little short skits. Not what i was hoping for. Not bad, just different.",1185235200,,167,4.6
8096258,2,B000C8ST7Q,"Along with Go Fish, and a few other rock bottom depictions of how ""WE"" (speak for yourself) live our lives, this is depressing.  The far too typical poor production value across the board applies here.  The sex is absolutely uninspiring.  But beyond that, it adds one more layer of stereotyping; a view from the gutter.  HELLO!  Millions of us DON'T live in the gutter. Even a movie that portrays that kind of life can be done well, but apparently too many lesbians don't know how to make those kinds of movies.  (thank God Nicole Conn gave it up!!)  Buy ""Fingersmith"" or ""Loving Annabelle"" or even ""Tipping The Velvet"", some of the best lesbian movies out there.",1162857600,6,663,4.663793103448276
8096259,2,B000C8ST7Q,"I agree with another reviewer when they wrote 'The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because it has ""lesbian"" anything in it...' I watched it with a friend and we both found it a totally depressing watch. Most the story lines are so negative that it makes you wonder if you should go straight. And the ones left over are killed by the dire production values. In what could be seen as a less than community minded act, after one watch I put it straight onto out local online auction site as i couldn't even be bothered having it my lesbian DVD collection its so annoying.",1160179200,3,575,4.284403669724771
8096260,4,B000C8ST7Q,"Bring the festival home! This is one of the best collections of lesbian shorts to date, from ten of today's most prominent lesbian filmmakers. For lesbians, by lesbians, and about lesbians, these shorts span the horizon of queer woman life.

The shorts range from a thriller about the moments that occur just before a hate crime; to a young butch having to deal with a homophobic mother at her grandfather's funeral; to a couple of young queers living on the streets and dealing with their pasts; to an inspiring documentary about a lesbian living homeless in Los Angeles -- and much more.

Not only do these shorts capture a wide array of lesbian life, they also encompass an impressively wide array of film genres and techniques. This collection is on the cutting edge of contemporary lesbian life, and lesbian film.",1143417600,3,818,4.835714285714285
8096261,2,B000C8ST7Q,"I was so excited when this movie came out, but I was very dissapointed in it. There were maybe two stories that I liked outof 10 or so. There are not hot sex scenes!! Some of them were long and drawn out! Don't waste your time the title hold's high expectations but don't expect much!",1141084800,6,284,4.181818181818182
8096262,5,B000C8ST7Q,"All the shorts in this collection deserve an excellent rating!  I've been unimpressed in the past with lesbian shorts collections, but all of these films have great scripts, believable characters, and provocative themes.  They were all well-acted, well-directed, and the and cinematography, music, and overall production value were excellent.  Lesbian filmmaking has come a long way in the past ten years.

The protagonists range in age from childhood to middle-age, and each story offers a different perspective of lesbian life--in some shorts, the characters' sexual orientation is a minor point, while in others it's the main focus of the plot.  However, all the films give a varied point of view and none of them are your usual cliched, cheesy, or stereotypical representations of lesbians.  All the characters breathe life as real, complex, and fully dimensional beings.  It's a worth-while collection for any film enthusiast!",1140220800,4,931,5.423611111111111
8096263,2,B000C8ST7Q,"The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because it has ""lesbian"" anything in it...

Total crap and waste of time watching this and while it touched on (just barely) some interesting subjects, I could't help but feel that I was being fed some more slightly stereotypical crap about what being a lesbian is like.

And hey, there are so many great movies aimed toward lesbians these days (sarcasm) that I had to give it 2 stars for trying.",1139875200,2,439,4.407407407407407
