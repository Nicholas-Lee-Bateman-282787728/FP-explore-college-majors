7673433,2,B01CDT5ZTG,"A kingdom is in rebellion against the incompetent king who is believed dead but is just in hiding. The film has 3-4 factions fighting against each other, mostly using magic and the power of chi. Not a martial arts film. Most of the film is taken up by talking about philosophy, rebellion, and forgiveness. They needed to cut out the half hour that put me to sleep. I have no idea why this has an ""R"" rating. Killing consists mostly of people just laying down.

I watched the film well dubbed in English with matching English subtitles.",1464566400,3,535,4.515463917525773

7673435,4,B01CDT5ZTG,"I watched this movie on youtube several times. Its originally the third movie in ""The Four"" series. It was released in Hong Kong in 2014.  It's a little bit of a B-movie but still good. I like that Yifei Liu is in it. All of ""The Four"" movies are good but this one is my favorite.",1462838400,8,280,4.0

7673442,2,B01CDT5ZTG,"I expected more of this movie, there's also a part 2 of this movie that it seems as if they mixed it up with another movie called lawless kingdom etc. Very smart of them to do such.....",1486166400,,185,4.027027027027027

7673447,5,B01CDT5ZTG,"I love this movie, this whole series is very interesting, I am not Chinese but I a find their Fantasy/Action cinema to be very enjoyable to watch.

7673455,2,B01CDT5ZTG,"Why is it that the solemn English narrator for these wuxia dramas always sound the same and says the same thing, ""it was a time of..........blah,blah,blah...."".  It was identical for Hero, Curse of Golden Flower, The Banquet and countless others.",1468108800,,246,5.15

8752674,2,B01CDT5ZTG,Watched on a purchased DVD. Dubbed in English and done well. Not enough action as I became bored in the middle of the film. Not as good as the first film. I found that one excellent. I have not seen Lawless Kingdom yet.,1527811200,,219,4.116279069767442
8752675,4,B01CDT5ZTG,It was a typical plot and fun magical martial arts film. It was a good mix of drama and action that some people enjoy. The same kind of people that don't realise that you're reading the subtitles in the first 5 minutes. Needless to say. I enjoyed it.,1526947200,,250,4.229166666666667
8752676,4,B01CDT5ZTG,"I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a bit difficult to follow at first, trying to keep track of all the players, but it became clearer as the movie progressed.  The story was enjoyable and the acting very good.  Great special effects, and the ending, well, you'll just have to wait and see for yourself.",1524700800,,303,4.472727272727273

8752678,4,B01CDT5ZTG,"very well done.  confusing as hell because of all the mixed motivations and plots within plots, but firmly holds your interest as you try to figure it out.

an odd blend of swordplay and magic, with some anachronistic firearms thrown in. great action scenes",1518307200,,257,4.818181818181818
8752679,3,B01CDT5ZTG,"disappointing ending to the trilogy, could have done so much more with the film",1517097600,,79,4.714285714285714
