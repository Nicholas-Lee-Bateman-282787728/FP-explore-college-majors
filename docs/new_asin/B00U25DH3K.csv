7027448,3,B00U25DH3K,"This is a collection of mostly bad movies but it's not valueless. Despite the cover there is no animation. This is a collection of mostly bad movies. They seem to have been filmed by high school youth groups.
Planet Patrol is a bad collision of old BBC One TV shows and the Power Rangers (with a touch of Transformers.) At 72 minutes long it is 40 minutes too long.
The Adventures of Chris Fable is an adaptation of the allegory Pilgrim's Progress and is by far the worst of the lot, It has bad acting, bad special effects, bad costumes and bad locations. (Why is the beginning filmed in a junk yard?) I could barely watch the first ten minutes. I then jumped from scene to scene to see if I could find something redeeming, I couldn't. At 110 minutes long it's 100 minutes (1 hour and 40 minutes) too long.
Phantom Town has a good story-line for young people -- children look for lost parents in a strange town with strange people -- but they run around too much. It actually has a good ending but it takes too long to get there. The acting is o.k and the special effects and props are o.k. At 81 minutes it's 50 minutes too long.
Shapeshifter is not bad for teens. Good story-line -- teen spy out to save his spy parents from a dictator -- and it's not too long. It has fair action, decent special effects and props and decent locations. I could see watching this with the the kids. At 90 minutes it's about right because the time is filled.
Teen Task Force is another movie for the kids. Although your kids are probably way ahead of the technology of this movie filmed in 2000 they'll probably get a kick of the kids outwitting the adults. The acting is fair and the special effects are fair. This is a movie teens and tweens will appreciate. At 80 minutes the running time is right because their are is no wasted time.
If you have children this collection is worth paying a few bucks (including the $4 or so postage) but don't expect a lot. I'm giving this to the library because I don't have children. If my sisters' kids were younger I might give it to one of them.
One last note: the images on the cover have nothing to do with the videos inside.",1434585600,12,2152,4.302955665024631
