8484917,5,B005SH63BA,"One of the greatest political comedies ever made finally gets a U.S. release due, I guess, to its recent showings on BBC America and the success of HBO's 'Veep' which is produced by Armando Ianucci, the same creative force behind 'The Thick of It'.

This is a fast-moving, profane and hilarious show which is similar in style to THE OFFICE (UK version), THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW, EXTRAS and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM ---(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-BBC-Collection-First-and-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office: The Complete BBC Collection (First and Second Series Plus Special)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Larry-Sanders-Show-The-Complete-Series/dp/B003NHMYJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Larry Sanders Show: The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extras-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000YI99IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extras: The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0000E2PVR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;) ----  It definitely falls into the 'cringe-comedy' category where characters who are (somewhat) sympathetic try to weasel their way out of squirm-inducing situations.

In a cast of great characters, the glue that holds it together is the spin doctor and Prime Minister's policy enforcer Malcolm Tucker, played ferociously by Peter Capaldi, who periodically descends upon the central group of characters who run a small British government department and proceeds to colorfully and articulately rip them all a new one.  The most suspenseful part of each episode is waiting to see Malcolm swing into action. If you are bothered by extreme, creative and gut-busting swearing this is probably not the show for you. The show actually employs a writer who does nothing but enhance the swearing and the hilariously nasty verbal imagery.

For most of the series run the main cast of characters have been part of the ruling party, presumably the Labour Party although it's never specifically stated.  In the upcoming 4th season they will be the Opposition, mirroring the election of the Conservative Party in the UK. Can't wait to see the tables turned!
