This documentary is meant for a totaly uninformed, uneducated public regarding history of Afghanistan for the last 30 years. I feel compelled to say that Soviet Union entered Afghanistan at the request of a legitimate government of Afghanistan. Soviet Union was there to combat terrorist, free women from oppression, educate the illiterate, and elevate the standards of living. Most war crime were committed by ""freedom fighters"" and not by the Soviet Union. Just to say, when Soviet Union withdrew, they left all the appropriate land mine maps behind, unlike any Western country when they would withdraw from their military theatre. So, just keep and open mind.",1187654400,,803,5.232558139534884
