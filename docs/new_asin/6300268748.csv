289116,5,6300268748,"Great WWII history not being taught in our high schools.  I had 5 uncles serve in WWII, 2 were in the battle of the bulge, 1 served on the USS Missouri.  By the grace of God, all came home safe.  I made a collection of WWII history films to pass on to my nephews.  I included Battle of the Bulge, The Desert Fox, MacArthur, The Longest Day, Patton, Unbroken and Tora! Tora! Tora!.  We paid a very high price for the freedom we enjoy; don't take it for granite, don't forget it and don't think that it won't happen again.",1516924800,4,520,4.16
289117,1,6300268748,"This movie starts out with the promise of a well done historic look at the biggest U.S. land battle in history. Then it goes down hill as soon as Fonda spots what no one did in the real battle. Other things are good but mostly it is ridiculous, and it led Ike Eisenhower, who was the overall Allied commander of forces in Western Europe and afterwards, President of the United States, to withdraw his initial enthusiasm for the movie and decry the total lack of any accuracy of the story.

As for me, I liked it when I was a young boy, it dovetailed nicely with the unrealistic WW2 comics I was reading at the time. But after reading a good bit of history of the war, and meeting veterans of the battle I was appalled. Not only was it a poor movie but it centered on only one German commander and the poor attempts to stop him, rather than the month long battle that was massive. The loose portrayal of Joachim Peiper ignored the fact that he was stopped and had his battle group destroy all of his tanks and vehicles because he was unable to capture enough gasoline to continue to fight, telling his men to form small group and walk out on their own to get back to the German lines. For some unknown (to me) the movie makers decided to put their Peiper figment of their imagination in charge of the battle on the German side. Figment Peiper eventually takes his lone tank on a wild ride to capture an American gasoline dump but ends up burning to death when a few GIs manage to roll burning 50 gallon gasoline drums downhill and in to the front of his tank.

A better, but still not broad enough, film of the battle is found in Band of Brothers. Why no one has tried to make a historically accurate film of the battle is a mystery to me. And if anyone wants to make an antiwar film based on a real battle, the Hertgen Forest battle, one rarely talked about, is the worst defeat of the U.S. Army in history. Conditions along Hitler's West Wall were such that American might could not be brought to bare against German forces who were fighting for their homeland in a defense in depth and the Americans were stopped, or slowed to the point that the war essentially ground to a stop even though fierce fighting continued day after day. I am of the educated opinion that Hitler actually opened the door to the Allied non-stop advance by launching his last great offensive, and when his armies were in retreat, the Allies followed them into Germany. Meanwhile, the near-static battle of the Hertgen continued.

Watch the film if you are into the Marvel/DC comics super hero films. It is just about the same kind of film.",1516665600,,2616,4.400826446280992

What makes this one strong is the story is well presented and offers up a pretty good view of this entire situation known as the Battle of the Bulge.

289244,3,6300268748,"I watched this film decades ago and it did not leave a great impression on me. But as I have learned ones first impression isn't always correct. But I was wrong on this one. This is one of those late 50s/ early 60s big lumbering wide screen colour and over-lit epics that were all the rage back then to grab  money away from the growing TV audiences.
The picture quality is very good except I found in a lot of shots both the right and left sides of the FRAME were a great deal lighter than the middle of the shot. Not sure it is a fault of the transfer or the original negative and the film stocks of the day.
The film suffers from that eras usage of Allied weaponry...  by simply painting an iron cross on the turret it is instantly a German Panzer. I am not complaining about those inaccurate details but the long running time, a half hour could have easily been trimmed out and not lost a lot of important story plot... if any.
Great actors for the most part. Some really great scenes inter-spersed between some really slow and pointless scenes. It is too bad that the production used so many rear-screen projection shots in this film that takes away from the great location shooting that is in most of the film.
The one important historical moment, the infamous massacre at Malmedy, was handled with the usual 1960s G rated non gruesome staging.
There are far too many POV shots trying to exploit the then CINERAMA experience... watching out of that context it simply takes one out of the movie.
The last battle seems to be fought, not in the Ardennes  at the end of December in one of the worst winters of the war... but in a warm spring day somewhere in some sub-desert location not found anywhere near the France/Germany border.
The audio commentary is not the worst nor close to being the best. It gives some interesting facts but as I have learned just because you are the director doesnt mean that every fact that you state is indeed correct & accurate information. At one point when talking about the tanks used in the film, Ken Annakin stated that they were Sherman tanks that were altered, which is incorrect. They may have used a few of them here and there in the BG.. but the so-called-Tiger tanks that the film is focusing on are NOT Sherman tanks but post war US tanks. Just proves Nothing is written in stone....",1509148800,,2331,4.441588785046729

However, if historical accuracy, competent film making and wicked battle scenes are your thing, you may want to look elsewhere. This movie was included in a World War 2 triple feature Blu-ray set I bought (with Defiance & Memphis Belle, both FAR Superior films) and I couldn't even finish it. I'll watch it again eventually, but after a a few drinks to make the model tanks and fake environments more entertaining.

289319,3,6300268748,"First of all this is not the movie with Henry Fonda and others.  It is a documentary that shows the real weather conditions during the Battle (which the movie laughingly doesn't).  It has real captured German film footage and their propaganda about how well the attack was going. (The huge tank battle scene in the movie did not happen.)  And it also ends with three minutes of a slightly funny stage show that purports to be what the people back in England were doing during the battle.

As an historical account of the battle this movie is a travesty.  However,  the acting is sufficient,  especially Robert Shaw, who gives by far the best performance.  It's a lot of strung together action sequences using a lot cool, but inaccurate,  equipment. I still find it a cool way to kill a couple of hours.

289339,5,6300268748,"This is supposed to be an epic war movie. And it is. It is a great vehicle for many of the popular actors of the time which includes some immortals. This is not intended to be a documentary. The over all intent of this presentation other than entertainment is to show that war has a lasting effect on those people that live through it.

The story is of course the title ""Battle of the Bulge"" only instead of concentrating on Bastogne we are treated to the formula which on the U.S. side Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley (Henry Fonda) figures out them sneaky Germans is going to attack through the forest and of course Col. Pritchard (Dana Andrews) wants to have Lt. Col. Kiley committed. On the German side Col. Martin Hessler (Robert Shaw) just wants to have fun playing tank and wants the war to go on for ever; however his sidekick Cpl. Conrad (Hans Christian Blech) has this thing about preserving his offspring from joining the fun of an endless war.

Can Gen. Grey (Robert Ryan) find a mistake the Germans have made and turn this around or will the German juggernaut just keep coming on. No fair looking at this movie from hindsight.

I have watched this movie on and off for several decades and even though the Blu-ray version does not add any new words or scenes to the movie it does add a sort of 3D effect that adds to ones viewing pleasure. As an added bonus Director Ken Annakin and Actor James McArthur (who plays Lt. Weaver in the movie) are still alive and adds a voice over commentary",1496793600,,1489,4.427007299270073

You have the war-loving colonel, and his valet - a sergeant - who just wants to go home and see his sons. You also get to hear the Germans sing the Panzer Lied.

Oh yeah, there's one more thing; the big tank battle towards the end. It's supposed to be in the thick and impenetrable Ardennes forest in the middle of winter? Well there are two things missing; trees and snow. It looks like they were fighting on a pool table.",1496448000,,687,4.4523809523809526

289359,4,6300268748,"THE GOOD: This movie was shot in 70mm Ultra-Panavison and looks excellent on blu-ray. The film has not been ridiculously touched up digitally and still has some frame shake and light film grain. The cinematography takes advantage of the ultra-panavision very well. There are many epic landscape battles, beautiful rows of tanks, soldiers and even some land/aerial point-of-view shots done in the style of Cinerama features. The snowy locations of this film are beautiful to behold. I also like that they kept the intermission and overture. The cast is also fantastic. Peter Fonda, Dana Andrews, Charles Bronson etc. I also like that this film provides the point of view of both the German and American armies.

THE BAD: The movie sometimes uses unnecessary rear projection effects that are likely the result of re-shoots and script changes. It looks like they actually used 70mm film stock to project, so it does look pretty damn convincing on blu-ray. However I have watched the dvd version and they are laughably bad sometimes. The script and plot is also pretty lackluster. This film primarily relies on it's visuals, which is the only reason I purchased it.

THE UGLY: This film is wildly inaccurate and was even publicly denounced by the President when it was released. I don't mind so much because basically every historical drama made in the 40's, 50's and 60's were inaccurate and most often used as propaganda. This movie takes a lot of liberties and rubs some people the wrong way, so I can understand not being able to watch it simply for this fact.",1495065600,,1560,4.90530303030303

289494,4,6300268748,"If you're looking for an account of the Battle of the Bulge that is factual and historically accurate, you would be better off looking elsewhere (""Band of Brothers"" covered it more truthfully) and yet this classic war movie is still worth a look. I'm not going to open a whole can of worms by discussing the myriad of inaccuracies, such as the German Tiger Tanks that actually aren't (ironically enough, they're American Patton tanks, painted up with German crosses) and the fact that nobody actually rolled burning oil drums downhill to thwart an attack. If you're going to enjoy this film, then it's necessary to suspend disbelief more than a little.

This is old-school war movie-making at its finest. When the Blu-Ray disc boots up, you're taken straight into the overture, something which younger viewers may be unfamiliar with: a short piece of the movie's music score that used to play while the audience was taking their seats. It's also a relatively bloodless movie, despite the slew of deaths on both sides, and the sort of thing that used to feature heavily on Sunday afternoon TV schedules.

""Battle of the Bulge"" has never looked this good before.  The Blu-Ray showcases a 1080p high-definition version of the movie, which in many places is almost eye-poppingly clear. The transfer seems to have cleaned up nicely, showing much more detail than DVD or TV broadcast versions of the movie. The soundtrack has been separated out nicely and still holds its clarity even when the volume is cranked up to levels guaranteed to annoy the neighbors. If you have the DVD already, I still recommend upgrading to the Blu Ray version if you're a fan of the film, especially at the price Amazon is offering it for. Historical revisionism aside, ""Battle of the Bulge"" has aged surprisingly well, and you'll find yourself humming the ear worm that is ""The Panzer Song"" for hours after watching it.",1483228800,3,1894,4.875776397515528

All tanks ran on gas which is a monument to the stupidity of politics in the US giving GM and Ford a chance to ramp up quickly without thinking of the tactical consequences. Sure it was easier to send gasoline. But you don't want to be in a gasoline run slow tank if  you lived through WW II.  Diesel. The Germans made many mistakes too making their  Panzer and Tiger tanks way to hard to service, a poor supply chain. and not enough of them. Had they HAD enough of them, boy the outcome might have been different in WW II. But  they gooned it attacking on two fronts.

This one stuck with me more than most of the others, so when I found it for cheep on Amazon . . .  I don't know if it was the actors in it - there is a bunch of fine actors and actresses in it - or the story - or the ending.  I think it is the final scene for me.  The scene with the German tanks trying to go up that muddy hill and spinning their tracks has stuck in my mind.  It is a kind of metaphor for a lot of other things - trying and trying and trying and eventually failing, that keeps coming into my mind in other contexts.  That is the mark of a good movie, you keep thinking of parts of it long after.  The scenes just sort of pop into your head.  The universality of a scene or idea.  Geez, I'm starting to sound like a movie critic.

290521,4,6300268748,"As with The Enemy Below (1957), I remember Battle of the Bulge best for its humanistic depiction of the frightful foe. Henry Fonda may be the film's prohibitive star attraction, its biggest name, yet I feel that Robert Shaw as the honorable panzer commander, Colonel Hessler, steals the movie with his sympathetic performance. Battle of the Bulge (1965) strived to capitalize on the gargantuan success of The Longest Day (1962), but falls somewhat short. Of the two, The Longest Day is the superior film, with its black & white pseudo-documentary style that lends it a far more realistic approach, with its cast that stuns with sheer star power, with its calculated shying away from clichd melodramatic asides. But back to the Bulge...

The Battle of the Bulge, running at 167 minutes, is a war picture deemed so epic that it merited an overture, an intermission, and an exit music. And, okay, its all-star roster ain't to sneeze at, either. Henry Fonda plays U.S. intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley, who, in the waning months of World War II and with the Allies on the cusp of ultimate victory, comes to suspect that the Germans have one final major offensive push in them, never mind that his immediate superiors (Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews) scoff at him. Col. Kiley is right, of course. The Germans have one more trick up their sleeve, one last try at stemming the inexorable tide. It involves a window of 50 hours in which the panzer brigades can wreak havoc even as, behind enemy lines (that is, Allied territory), crack German commandos pose as American G.I.s and indulge in sabotage and mayhem. Col. Hessler is cautioned that once these 50 hours elapse, Germany would have run out of resources for a full-scale assault.

When this first came out, this movie was lambasted pillar to post for its historical inaccuracies, yet one more reason it isn't regarded as highly as The Longest Day. The studio argued that some measure of verisimilitude was sacrificed to fit the thing into the Hollywood mold. In this case, I'm with the detractors. Doesn't mean that it's not a watchable movie, but if you're a WWII history buff, yeah, this movie may feel like a slap in the face. Frankly, Battleground (1949) was a better recounting of the Battle of the Bulge.

But, me, I liked watching it because I generally like war pictures, especially those that go for the sweeping, epic storytelling. And I like the cast, particularly Shaw and Fonda. Fonda plays his typical thinking man's hero role. Shaw, exuding Teutonic austerity, is super as the vaunted master strategist and commander of the Tiger tank corps who only ever eats what those under his command eats ""so I know how far they can go."" Col. Hessler may be the enemy, but he's a righteous, honor-bound dude, and I found myself quickly respecting him and empathizing with him. The best moment of the film may be Shaw's Col. Hessler inspecting his new crew and confessing his doubts because these soldiers looked so young (""Boys. Too many boys.""), at which point the soldiers start stomping and singing a rousing German song (""Panzerlied"") to prove their loyalty and resolve. At some point, Hessler joins in. Was a hell of a scene.

The supporting cast features three memorable - memorable for me, anyway - characters, and here's my throwing in a ***SPOILER*** alert for the rest of this paragraph. Telly Savalas is Sgt. Guffy, the boisterous black market operator who initially cares more about his merchandise but who has his mercenary heart melted by his cute European business partner (Pier Angeli). Charles Bronson channels his patented man of few words persona but still makes an impression as the level-headed major who, when he becomes a prisoner-of-war, beards Hessler in his den to demand that his soldiers be treated well or else. Lastly, James MacArthur plays a callow young lieutenant who goes thru some harrowing sh-- and is forced to grow up fast.

3.5 out of 5 stars for The Battle of the Bulge, the movie, not the campaign itself. I'm not a WWII buff, so I wasn't aware of them until a pal pointed out the peppering of historical distortions, so I can't say I counted that as a huge drawback for me. As much as I enjoyed it, I can't help but compare this to other colosally produced yet better executed WWII films: Patton (1970), The Great Escape (1963), A Bridge Too Far (1977), The Longest Day, etc... I also feel that the ending comes off a bit anti-climactic and small-scale, not at all in keeping with the scope and ambition of the movie. One huge positive to take away is the attention to detail paid to the grubby minutiae of waging war from both sides, ranging from strategy-making to the factoring in of resources to the mind-numbing ennui the grunts experience during downtime or as they go thru their everyday routine. It's actually an absorbing peek.",1434499200,,4837,4.801920768307323

290967,5,6300268748,"Yes, many historians (reputedly including Ike, himself) have denounced this epic-scale war film then and since its December, 1965 release and there is little doubt about the validity of their criticisms. ""Synthesizing"" the real-life characters and events of December, 1944, the filmmakers (who mostly shot it in summertime Spain rather than the wintertime Ardennes) do nevertheless manage to preserve the spirit, if not the letter, of the times. I know, because I first attended it as a twelve-year-old boy in the company of my father, a Bulge veteran, and I have recently been reading historical tomes on the seventieth anniversary of the battle. So, it has become an annual yuletide chestnut for me, no less than ""It's A Wonderful Life"", no doubt because of that nostalgic personal connection to a departed member of the Greatest Generation. Perhaps you have such an emotional recollection, yourself.... This version, like its DVD predecessor, presents the unabridged ""roadshow"" version of the film, along with period featurettes. It also includes an exclusive audio commentary by the now-deceased director, Ken Annakin, and actor, James MacArthur. So, put down your history books and enjoy it the way you might first have done so as a wide-eyed spectator at your father's elbow. On a 70"" inch high definition screen,  the ""Tiger tanks"" may look just as frightening and ""Panzerlied"" sound just as infectious....",1419811200,,1413,5.28

I recently bought the DVD in order to watch it during the 70th anniversary of that pivotal battle. As a 30-year Army veteran whose first tour was in Germany, I was disappointed in the film which I vaguely recall having watched when it first came out in 1965.  The terrain was generally completely unlike that on which the battle had been fought, and there was next to no snow on the ground.  Although the siege of Bastogne and the Malmedy massacre were mentioned, other aspects of the battle were so fuzzy that the viewer would not gain a true appreciation of the actual battle.  For example, we never learn in the movie in which unit Robert Ryan and Henry Fonda serve.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the scene in which the young tank commanders sing ""Panzerlied"" and have watched it over and over again on Youtube, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone desiring to learn about this turning point of WWII.",1419552000,3,989,4.564971751412429

The movie is quite long as it is [remember intermissions?] so something had to be left out. However, to omit Gen. Patton's part in the Battle is unforgivable. Also, the German tanks appear to be advancing in CA terrain, instead of the snow and mud covered fields of Belgium. The German Tiger tanks bogged down in this mud. The American tanks never seem to win an engagement, which isn't true to history. There is a disclaimer at the end of the film to try to cover these omissions. However, the producers could have left out some extraneous material, and saved room for more history. This would have better honored our brave fighting soldiers.",1418515200,3,883,4.666666666666667

291066,4,6300268748,"This film has a great cast and depicts the life and death struggle that raged 70 years ago in Belgium and Luxembourg.  This was the greatest American land battle of WW2.

At 5:30 in the morning on the 16th of December, 1944 a massive artillery bombardment was launched by the German army at Hosingen in Luxembourg, marking the start of what later became known as the Battle of the Bulge.

Shortly after the D-day landings on July 31, 1944 Hitler held a staff conference and began to plan his counter stroke.  He insisted over and over that the final decision would come in the west.  He would wait until winter when weather conditions would ground allied aircraft eliminating allied air superiority and support.  He would gather his armored forces in one last desperate gamble using the same historic geography of 1870, 18914 and 1940 -- the Ardennes forest.  His goal was to push through the allied defenses and capture the port of Antwerp cutting off the mainly British forces in the North and leading to a second Dunkirk.  The plan was given the name ""Wacht am Rhein"" -- Watch on the Rhine -- a deliberate piece of misinformation.

The German forces, led by the Sixth Panzer Army with all its Waffen SS armored divisions, was in the vanguard against weak American forces on what had been  a ""quiet"" part of the front.  On learning of the German offensive Eisenhower was quick to recognize the significance of the German attack.  ""We must rush two armored divisions to the aid of Middleton's VII corps!"", said Eisenhower. The 101st Airborne division was sent with no time to prepare and little winter equipment via truck 100 miles to Bastogne.  The commander of the 101st was Brigadier General McAuliffe who was only in command due to the absence of Maxwell Taylor who was on Christmas vacation in the states.  McAuliffe was principally known up to this point as a desk general.

German forces quickly pushed forward and managed to surround Bastogne which occupied a critical road nexus in the German's path.

""On the 22nd December 1944, general Heinrich Freiherr von Lutwitz, Commander of the German troops which were besieging Bastogne sent Major Wagner and Lieutenant Helmut Henke with a demand for the surrender of the American garrison.  When Brigadier General Anthony C. McAuliffe, the Town Commander in Bastogne. was brought the note he laughed, and made his legendary comment, ""Nuts"".  He was then reminded that the emissaries awaited a written reply, to which he asked: ""What should I say then?""  ""Your first comment is exactly right, Sir,"" opined Colonel W. O. Kinnard.  Those present laughed and applauded, while McAuliffe sat down, writing as his answer a single word - ""NUTS!"".  Colonel Harper handed the intermediaries the answer, but Lieutenant Henke, the spokesman was uncertain.  ""Is the answer to the affirmative or to the negative?""  ""Certainly not to the affirmative, said Harper, ""Go to Hell!""  Source: The Battle of the Bulge, Jean Milmeister, 2011.

Bastogne was besieged and bombarded from the air and attacked throughout Christmas week.  American forces were resupplied by air drops in C-47s from the UK.  The ""battling bastards of Bastogne,"" who lacked a medical headquarters, refused to surrender.

In his finest hour, General George S. Patton drove the fourth division of his Third Army forwards to counterattack the Germans and relieve the siege of Bastogne (see the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patton-HD/dp/B009EE4T8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patton [HD</a>]).  On the 26th of December near Ettelbruck Belgium ""Lieutenant Boggess drove his Sherman, guns blazing, through the village and towards a wood.  At the edge of the wood there could be seen some shadowy figures.  Were they German or Americans?  Bogges cautiously opened his turret and called: ""Come here!  This is the 4th Armored Division!""

Suspiciously, a couple of heads emerged from foxholes.  A figure came cautiously near.  ""Lieutenant Webster, 326th Engineer Battalion, 101st Airborne Division.""  Bogges leant forward and shook hands.  After a four day encirclement the German siege was broken.

The Battle of the Bulge was a decisive American victory in the Second World War.  By the end of January, the Germans had been thrown back to their original starting positions.  Out of approximately 500,000 Germans engaged in the battle, there were 81,834 casualties including 12.652 killed.  Out of approximately 600,000 Americans who fought in the battle of the Bulge there were 80,987 casualties with 10,276 killed.  Hitler had fired his last bolt and missed.  The Germans had been critically weakened making it easier for the Red Army in the East to sweep forward towards Berlin and for the Allies to cross the Rhine into Germany.

If you have a chance to visit the Bastogne area today, you will find many museums and monuments dedicated to the bloody events of December 1944.

There are some fascinating connections between this movie and George Lucas' Star Wars.  First, the director of this film was Ken Annakin -- does that ring a bell?  Lucas denied that he named his character after Ken but I wonder.  Second, in this film one American soldier says, ""I have a bad feeling about this"".  Later an American tanker urges his fellow tankers to be ""Steady, steady"" before taking their shot on German tanks (instead of the death star).  Annakin also directed parts of the the classic war film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Longest-Day-Blu-ray/dp/B00J11U5CW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Longest Day [Blu-ray</a>].

The film was made in about 8 months in Spain and suffers from some slapdash film-making.  It omits mention of Patton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patton-HD/dp/B009EE4T8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patton [HD</a>]) who played a crucial role in this battle.  Even the 101st in Bastogne is given short shrift.  Ike actually came out of retirement to hold a press conference denouncing this film for its inaccuracies.

Henry Fonda is excellent as a former cop, now in the army as an officer who believes the Germans aren't quite through and feels a counter-attack by them might be imminent.  Of course some of the brass at headquarters scoff at him in the early stages of the movie, but all that changes when the surprise attack begins and Fonda's character is proven right.  Robert Shaw makes for a very menacing and strong-willed German tank commander.",1407024000,,483,4.726190476190476

291333,4,6300268748,"Though there is significant attention paid to the character played by Henry Fonda, the overall scope and sequence of the film is well done.  The film does not highlight the men surrounded at Bastogne which seemed strange with only a brief scene mentioned in the film related to incidents there.  The film does highlight the massacre of American POWs near Malmady which is an important evidence related to real atrocities committed by German S.S. units.  The film highlights the strategic abilities and tactical advantages which surprise gave them in the last German offensive of the war.  One of the disappointments of the film related to some of the cinematography which clearly revealed evidence that much of the filming was done in an area that did not even slightly align with Northwestern Europe in the area of Belgium and France - tank battles in the midst of sage brush?  A generally good primer for the student of history who wishes to imagine what desperate straights the Allies still faced on the eve of ultimate victory over Nazi Germany.",1405987200,,1049,4.903954802259887

291396,2,6300268748,"A good example of how many (often, fondly-remembered) movies just don't survive the test of time.

Big stars, big battles...but a bit boring.

I recall seeing this in a theater when a much younger guy, and, even then, still had a sense that I was watching some kind of pageant rather than a gripping narrative or drama (It was Bastogne, for Pete's sake. If they couldn't make that kind of thing dramatic...)  Not the first time Hollywood wasted Honda's wonderful talent (They did it again in another ho-hum WW II blockbuster, Midway)

Anyway, that's the basis for my low rating--not simply (or just) the historical and hardware inaccuracies.  And with a budget that big, why didn't they just manufacture a couple of Sherman tank bodies and put them over truck chassis to heighten the realism?

So, spare yourself this, and buy the Steven Spielberg TV series, Band of Brothers, which offers up the same time and place with the kind of gut-grabbing realism that very few 50s and 60s war movies delivered. There were some that did, but this is not one of them.  About accuracy, Producer Spielberg figured BofB was three to four more times accurate than other movies like this. That would include episodes such as the Malmedy Massacre, perpetrated more by accident than design by--wait for it--fuzz-faced 17 and 18 year olds under the command of hardened SS personnel who'd somehow survived the horror and butchery of the Russian front. Now THERE's a story!!",1402358400,,1454,4.862348178137652

The audio and video transfer is excellent and the sound of this movie on my home theatre system realy blows me away. Lots of Hollywood A list stars in this flick such as Hank Fonda,Dana Andrews and a young Charlie Bronson and Telly Savales.

Sure the German tiger tanks were played by M-47s panted to look German but even more acclaimed war movies such as 'Patton' or 'The Big Red One' did something similar.  This movie didn't depict real events surrounding this famous WWII battle too accurately detail-wise however, as some other reviewers had mentioned, this is a classic Hollywood war movie to enjoy but not necessarily a docudrama to educate (even though it also tried to integrate real-life elements such as bad weather, the Malmedy massacre, German soldiers in GI uniform, German fuel shortage, Bastogne siege, the 'Nuts' response, etc. into the story).

This review is for the the remastered release on blu-ray.

The picture quality is fantastic, and in fact looks better than some of the movies that have come out in the last couple of years.  Now in saying that this doesn't mean the picture is as good as the better quality new releases, but better than many.  For instance I commonly see fuzz on items in the background of various new movies.  This remaster is better than that.  Colors are wonderful and the main focus of the camera, be it a person or scene are sharp and detailed. That's the best you can expect with any remaster.

The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the usual Hollywood need for a hero who saves the day single-handedly. In this case the hero is played by Henry Fonda, who was a fine actor but perhaps getting a bit old to play an active duty junior officer of WWII and is burdened by a plot that forces him to be in exactly the right place during the entire course of the nearly month-long battle.  Having said that, this is still the best movie that has been made on the biggest battle that American forces had against the German Army in WWII.",1397865600,,694,4.37984496124031

I am near finishing Churchill's six volume series ""World War II"", which is history source material and highly recommended for anyone wanting to understand how war communications were sent and received by possibly the greatest Western leader of the XXth century.
Although the characters and a lot of the action are likely fiction, this is a slam bang action flick.
Also, a lot of the details, like use of deception and the critical importance of supply lines, show the profound requirement for organization and intelligence in executing battle plans.
Shaw, though he plays his part characteristically well, comes across as a sort of caricature, somewhere between a klingon and a sociopathic human.
I don't know if the German commanders were really like that; A lot of them weren't Nazis.  When Rundstedt was asked what to do when the allies broke out of Normandy, he reportedly replied to Keitl ""sue for peace, idiot"".  But, they did their jobs.  And sometimes with the incredible brutality with which they are tarred in war movies like this.  We can't claim exception after My Lai and the CIA prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The original battles were fought in a snow covered very mountainous area, the Ardennes and the Eifel, and not in a rather flat countryside w/out snow. Even though I hate snow - the lack of it in this movie is simply incorrect.
With minimal investments they could have easily changed the appearance of the M-47 Patton tanks into Panzer III by welding a bit of sheet metal around the turrets. This would at least have given the illusion of ""real"" German tanks of that era. Calling these fake Tigers ""Tigers"" hurts. To portray the Tigers Ken Annakin and his staff could have converted the rear of some random tanks with a Tiger-like exhaust and filmed from maybe two ft. above ground to show the enormity of these giant beasts - but that is only my personal opinion.",1392249600,,978,4.626436781609195

Ffront battle of  WW2  &needs to be understood.  This movie clarifies some of the
key military points, lessons and the actors are excellent..
The Germens counteroffensive was cleverly planned
and originally executed well.  The Germans even furtively removed
some key divisions from the much more critical battles on the Eastern Front to launch it.
The Germans  figured maybe to get the  US (and UK) to negotiate  but
by 1944 the US-UK- Russian war alliance was  still  solidly in force , at least until the Nazis
were beaten.
Even though the US,  initially caught off guard,  it is shown  most units did not panic and
bravely grappled with  temporarily vastly  superior  German elite armored  and infantry corps..
Eventually the German offensive bogged down , . The role  of ordinary GIs rising to heroic
feats in well shown in this film.  The mass murder of disarmed  prisoners  at Malmedy  and
the uncovering of German infiltrators in US  GI uniforms  shows what kind of  brutality
and stealth modern war has descended to.
As the battle was fought in the snowy fields of Belgium , I was puzzled why the movie did
not stick to the snowy  terrain ALL through the movie?.
Well, maybe  Europe was getting warmer by 1965 when the movie was filmed ?

291632,2,6300268748,"Though full of movie stars, the film Battle of the Bulge was not good if you are a stickler for historical accuracy.  So many things wrong with the film, see IMBD for complete list, but briefly: tanks not correct type despite what director says in DVD comments, flim reversed/flipped left to right in some scenes (machine guns on tanks on wrong side), models of tanks, rockets, etc incorrect, the large movie lights reflect and reflections seen in helmets, glasses, etc, camo patterns incorrect for nation and time,  The soldiers who are shot, always throw both arms in the air before they fall, which by the time the movie ends is laughable...someone must have instructed them to all throw both arms into the air.  Items appear and disappear in movie scenes (the explosives on front of tank which drives over stone wall, the helmet on back of Telly Savalas head in the kissing scene, etc).
Many items in the movie did not exist at the time of the BOTB including the airplane in which Henry Fonda rides, the plastic explosive named in the film, etc.

Definitely recommend as a true classic!

This film is 90% fiction based upon a pivotal time during the war.

291670,3,6300268748,"Why do I watch it again, I ask myself.  The technical and historical inaccuracies are extremely annoying.  Like ""Full Metal Jacket"", I find it frustrating to see a big budget war movie that seems like it saved money on consultants--or hired but didn't listen to them.  The locations are wrong, the tanks are wrong, the sequence of events is wrong, and so on and so on.  Even the model airplane in the underground---come on, guys.  How hard is it to make your model at least look like the ME-262?

However, most of the acting is good.  Henry Fonda always does a good job.  James MacArthur, Charles Bronson, and Robert Shaw as the fictional Col. Hessler, were all well done.  Robert Ryan and Dana Andrews were disappointing, partly because of the lines written for them and partly not so great direction, I guess.

All in all, a barely OK and very long movie.",1389139200,,857,4.578947368421052

291711,1,6300268748,"This movie is a collection of stickmen wandering through a morass of poor writing and a lack of historical accuracy. Obviously Henry Fonda's character, Colonel Dan Kiley, should have been appointed Supreme Allied Commander instead of Eisenhower because he clearly had a better grasp of the battlefield conditions and could anticipate the strategy of the German army. Additionally Colonel Kiley seemed to be functioning as 2nd lieutenant rather than  a colonel, grabbing a rifle from an enlisted man and becoming a frontline soldier. That could happen. How a movie could be made about the battle of the bulge without mentioning General Patton indicates lack of historical perspective. Maybe Henry Fonda accepted the role because he needed to pay for an addition on his house. I can find no other plausible explanation.",1388448000,3,817,5.236641221374046

There is so much wrong with the historical aspect of the film that it is too difficult to even list.

Maybe it's me, but I don't you see enough of Robert Ryan's character as the general trying to outsmart Shaw's character.  We need a little more depth to him and it's not Ryan's fault.  I think they just had too many ""stars"" to showcase and didn't want to make the movie longer.  Overall, though, I'd give it 1 1/2 boxes of popcorn.  Also, pay attention to Telly Savalas --- Guffy goes from being a real money-grubbing hard-nosed b###***d to one of the more interesting characters in the entire movie.",1385683200,,705,4.4765625

It isn't really historically accurate at all - yes, there was a battle that came to be called ""The Bulge"" in Dec 1944 and the names of the commanders are correct as well as maybe a few other tiny facts in this movie. And no, although the Germans knew of and hoped to capture the Allied fuel supplies they didn't know exactly where they were and never got within the few hundred yards to have the Americans roll burning barrels into their Panzers as the movie depicts. - and for the most part this is a movie made with a whole bunch of Hollywood liberties.

291875,1,6300268748,"While I am typically an avid antagonist for `reboot' cinema, I feel this particular piece could benefit from such a treatment immensely.

I understand the need for film dramatization and the tendency for older works to spontaneously burst in to song (with magical inclusion of conspicuous full orchestration), I just can't get over the silliness depicted in the military storyline progression (i.e., the naive portrayal of command ideology, soldiers on both sides acting in flagrant stereotype, and reconnaissance relegated to one yokel in a single-prop trainer with a hand-held camera).

However, I had to stop watching when the film grandiosely displayed Panzer-Lehr ""Tiger II"" heavy armor (Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B), but what the film-makers actually used on-screen were M46 Pattons... medium armor that was not only American, but also did not even go into production until the Korean War.

My rationale behind my disgust is this:  When creating a film depicting historical events in which lives were lost, the least the film-makers can do is show a little historical accuracy and basic respect for those that died; that is hardly an overly harsh requisite for profiteering off the dead.

Dramatization is necessary, and no film depiction of any kind will ever have anything close to complete historical accuracy... yet some subject matter simply should not be relegated to mere 'entertainment'.",1382745600,5,1404,5.363636363636363

This movie was made especially for the Cinerama Theater that was a wide three to four screen movie theater that was suppose to provide a special effect type picture screen.

I give it 3 stars because there are some very good moments to this movie with excellent detail action scenes, like showing what happened when the Germans execute their American Army prisoners, and what a great job in making the American Patton Tanks of the time this movie was made, to look like the German Mark V Tiger Tanks that were the main guard of the German Panzer Tank force during the Battle of the Bulge on December 16, 1944",1376179200,,1019,4.543478260869565

292079,5,6300268748,"This review is about the movie itself. I have watched it many times on cable TV over the years. Often they cut some important scenes to make it fit in an allotted time slot. IMO, the movie is best when you watch the whole thing and not one cut to fit. It is kind of a long movie, so it is understandable that it is often cut.

The main thing you have to remember is that the movie is almost complete fiction. It does not accurately depict anything that actually happened at the real Battle of the Bulge or anywhere else for that matter. You have to appreciate it as historical fiction, or it will make you crazy.

The movie has a number of stars in it (Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Dana Andrews) and some up and coming actors including Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas (""Who loves ya, baby?) and James McArthur (""Book'em Danno!"").

There are a number of classic scenes in the movie that tend to get cut for some reason including the Panzer commanders and Oberst Hessler singing the Panzerlied song soon after he takes command of the Panzer brigade chosen to be the spearhead of the attack.

The movie has always seemed somewhat sympathetic to me to the Hessler character (played by Robert Shaw) initially. later in the movie in a very ham handed way it makes him into a caricature of the prototypical Nazi soldier. I guess it was not possible to leave him as a heroic and sympathetic character.

It is one of those star filled epics that we are likely not to see made anymore. Hollywood just does not make these kind of movies anymore. The craftsmanship is good, although the battles are very sanitized as was common until fairly recently.

292081,5,6300268748,"I have loved this movie since seeing it as a TV re-run in 1971 or so, shown over two nights on a major network.

This 1965 movie has an incredible Who's Who of an all-star cast, with great, memorable lines and a basically true story, which, as the film mentions in an end graphic, has some characters and story lines compressed, but it's most assuredly based on actual events.  As to the ""big picture"" events in this movie, it is totally accurate.  That they might have used the wrong model of tank because Hollywood didn't have access to the right ones 20 years later--for crying out loud, WHO CARES?!  My uncle fought in the Battle of the Bulge and LOVED this movie.

As to the story, esp. the human interest stories within--yes, romance, profiteering, the disbelief by American military leaders that the Germans were indeed launching an offensive, the Waffen SS murdering MANY American POWs out in the snow, the Germans using well-trained-American-English-speaking soldiers to trick the Allies, courage, growth from naivete to being mature and experienced (James McArthur's character), the fanaticism of the Germans, much death, fear, and LOTS more, this movie is just a landmark, great film.  It is NOT all about tanks and guns and killing, folks.  It is much more about dialog and human emotions and behavior under various forms of stress caused by war.

Strangely--and wonderfully--this movie has always, from VHS to DVD to Blu Ray releases, had a gorgeous, brand-new-quality picture.  And the DVD and Blu Ray, both of which I am reviewing here, are just beautiful.  Both contain but one defect, likely a few missing or damaged frames in the master print in the scene where the high-priced call girl is leaving Robert Shaw's office; when she's at the door, there's a split-second missing frame or two.  Other than that issue (on ALL versions, starting with the VHS), the picture quality is AMAZING.  Just new looking, clean, colorful, and very sharp.

Hightly recommended on ALL counts!  Enjoy.",1369094400,3,2000,4.949101796407185

I guess at the time, it was the best Hollywood could come up with given the era and technology available.  But using Spanish Army, American-made Patton tanks and Americam-made Half-tracks was hard to swallow.  Also, the contrast of the Spanish terrain (desert, high mountain scenary that looked a lot like southern California) to what should have been the forests and hill of the Ardienne, was also hard wot watch.  I heard Eisenhower came out of retirement to announce his disagreement with the movie and that the events portrayed were simply not true.

The Henry Fonda character actually existed up to the point where he was ""reassigned"" because of his crazy idea that the Germans were going to attack. At that point, he disappears from the stage, unlike Fonda in the movie.

Good entertainment, and a reasonably accurate over-all view of the Battle, in that the Americans won and the Germans lost. The Germans imitating American soldiers were, by the way, summarily tried and executed upon capture.",1365638400,,767,4.892307692307693

The conclusion in which a Nazi Robert Shaw dies in a conflagration of burning oil barrels is actually anti-climactic - this film had died very early. Perhaps my biggest objection was the Spanish terrain which bore absolutely no relation to the  heavy woods of the Ardennes.

This movie is a synopsis of many of the historical events that took place during that battle.  It is not 100% historically accurate but paints a very good picture of how the American Army was taken by surprise by the initial German assault.  Robert Shaw does a wonderful job of portraying a German panzer commander who believes that victory can be achieved.  Charles Bronson plays an American major who is given the task to hold Ambleve against all odds.  Henry Fonda is excellent as an American G-2, Division Intelligence Officer, who picks up on the fact that the Germans are about to attack when everyone thinks he is wrong.  And Telly Savalas is perfect for the role of ""Guffy"", a tank commander caught up in the tides of war and love of a local Belgian woman.  If you like epic movies, The Battle of the Bulge is for you.  The development of the characters is superb.

What makes this hard to accept is the filming done at what had to be Fort Hood in Texas with all of its wide open spaces totally unlike the forests and mountains where the real battle was fought.

The three actors mentioned did their best to salvage this thing with their legendary acting skills, but it was all wasted on the blown apart turret on a Sherman tank where the crew was intact and rushing to save the day.

292259,3,6300268748,"The Blu-Ray transfer of this movie is quite good. Great colors, good depth and contrasts, and steady as a rock.

The movie itself, however, grows more unbelievable as it proceeds. The producer and director make an attempt through the beginning and middle of the film to give one the feel of the brutal winter that settled into Belgium and France during the 5-6 weeks over which the battle raged, with patches of snow scattered here and there, and with a generalized chilly haze filling the air. But by the film's end, we're clearly off shooting in the arid Cascade Mountain Range in Washington state, with sunshine beaming gloriously. We're not anywhere near the Ardennes, and winter is but a distant memory. The final apocryphal battle between the massed tanks of both sides in the movie (there were tank battles during the Bulge, but no final, decisive one) takes place on a vast and barren plain that would have cost a pre-CGI fortune to decorate with snow, fake or real, so we get no snow to speak of...and no trees, either.

There are other cases of artistic license being taken in this film that are rather odd. The idea that the Bulge was a 50-hour gambit on the part of the Germans to charge to Antwerp is a misrepresentation of history. The plan actually called for the Germans to get halfway to Antwerp in 4 days (96 hours), with the expectation that the second half of the push would be a bit tougher. If this movie is your only reference point for what happened during The Bulge, you'll believe that the whole thing was over in a little over two days.

The film is correct in asserting that the Germans were low on fuel, but it fails to mention that the Germans did capture any number of large Allied fuel dumps during the initial days of the battle that allowed them to refuel and continue advancing. Allied infantry actually did a good job holding up the German advance, while blowing numerous fuel dumps in advance of the German tanks that forced the Germans to alter course and advance on secondary targets to find fuel.

The film includes a scene that is presumably based on the infamous Malmady Massacre of Dec 17, 1944, wherein German SS troops summarily executed 84 American POWs. The film does not, however, include any mention of the Chenogne Massacre of New Year's Day, 1945, wherein American troops summarily executed some 60 German POWs in retaliation for the massacre at Malmady. To the victor belongs the cinematic spoils, I guess.

Still, an enjoyable film on many levels. Just realize that this is no *Band of Brothers,* but rather, a 1960s Hollywood take on WWII, which means that nuance and historical accuracy will be in short supply (the film had its American premiere on Dec 16, 1965, 21 years to the day that the actual Battle began).

BTW - you may notice that the ""victory"" music on the soundtrack sounds suspiciously like the Finale from the Fifth Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich. I don't know that the similarity was unintended.",1355788800,9,2967,4.696153846153846

The worst sort of flag waving, hollywood ideal of what a distant but important battle might have been fought like based on the pictures in that Spanish holiday brochure at the dentists. Forget the facts that the tanks are all the same 60's era types painted grey (German) or green (Allied), or that the war was fought in freezing winter with deep snow and foggy skies (see Band of Brothers for a 100% more authentic experience), not Spain. Or a million other problems that might sound pendantic but seem important to me so as not to cheapen the truth or disrespect those who were there. If only the producers had looked more closely at the information on the packets of the airfix models used in the climactic battle scene, they would have found far more autheticity and attention to detail there.

It's not awful; but compared to the Dam Busters, The Longest Day, A Bridge too Far, the Band of Brothers Mini series, or especially Battle Ground (which depicts the same battle) this is filmmaking extremely low on style and honesty. Watch one of those. Or Where Eagles Dare or The Guns of Navarone or the Great Escape. At least they don't pretend to be anything they most definitely are not. There are war movies that just seek to tell an adventure story to excite us; and war movies that seek to tell some form of the real story, and by through authenticity, to move us. This is neither.

292300,4,6300268748,"I bought this long time favorite WWII Film just the other day on ""Amazon Instant Video"" at just $5.00.  I decided to get the replacement after getting rid of all my VHS Tapes to charity, of which this movie was a staple in that collection.

I was surprised and grateful to see many scenes in this version that hardly ever showed up on TV Broadcasts and were not on my particular VHS Version.  One extended scene that stands out is more footage of the English Speaking German Soldiers preparing for their sabotage mission on U.S. Troops in the Ardennes Forrest, which should have never been cut out in the first place.  In particular, the part where the German Colonel Hessler is surrounded by them at a German Headquarters and he really thinks they are Americans.  There are other scenes like this added back in to this version but again, this one stands out.

Speaking of Col. Hessler as played by Robert Shaw, he may be an Irishman in real life but he is totally convincing as the German Villain in this story and a real treat to watch...  There are many good supporting cast members in this one who went on to even greater fame in the 1970's such as Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas.  However, during the 60's both of these guys tended to show up in ensemble cast WWII Productions as I recall.  Henry Fonda is OK in the nominal lead role although many others could have played his part with equal, if not better chops in this particular vehicle.

There are definitely some historical inaccuracies in this one but what the hey, it is Hollywood afterall...  A fine score accompanies the film and along with ""The Great Escape"", this ranks as one of my favorite all-time WWII Movies and you can't go wrong at $5.00 in adding this to your collection.",1353715200,6,1749,4.538216560509555

292303,4,6300268748,"In 1965 what made this movie better than a generation of WWII large scale epics was the 70MM Ultra-Panavision. I will spare you the technical stuff except to say:
This was a super wide screen film and an early example (Not the first) of a technology that used more than one camera in a specially built movie theater. The result was not 3D or even the new IMAX just a step along the way.

I can remember seeing this on a huge wrap around screen and feeling my stomach drop in the opening scene as Henry Fonda flies about in a light observation plane. I have to laugh at the notion of some one streaming this onto a 6 inch cellphone/tablet screen and pretending to enjoy.

This is not a great movie. Henry Fonda never seems actually care about his character. Most of the rest of the American side never seems to commit to the movie. Telly Savals as an entrepreneurial tanker is so exceptional that he will reprise this role, exactly, in Kelly's Heros.  Charles Bronson as Major Wolenski is worth watching. His Death Wish character may have its roots here.

I am certain that in terms of Hollywood character trees, Sgt. Duquesnes has to be related to Special Agent Gibbs in NCIS, but they can't be any closer than uncle/nephew. Maybe the French spelling was too much for small town post WWII USA.

This movie is almost a tour De force for Robert Shaw as Col. Hessler and Hans Christian Blech as his aid Conrad. Note that the scars on Mr. Blech were earned in his days as a German soldier on the Russian front.  Shaw is totally committed to and believable as the commander of the German tank forces. Conrad is his equal as an actor and between them are the only consistent, quality performances of this movie.

Bottom line, this movie mostly clanks and clunks along as typical Hollywood WWII `history' of its period. It is worthwhile to own if you are a WWII film buff, into the technical side of movie making... although this is not exactly a land mark in movie technology and it's a good popcorn movie when its not chick flick night.",1350172800,2,2031,4.472972972972973

The tank battles are laughable with American tanks standing in for German (which is understandable), but WHY didn't they use Shermans to represent Shermans???

292344,1,6300268748,"I give this movie a 1 star for the acting and layout of the movie.

1) From the start this movie is chezzie.  It shows Henry Fonday flying and taking a photo of two German Officers riding in a car.  The flying part looks so cheap.  No pilot is going to fly like he's on horse.  As they flew over the German the driver of the car was acting stupid.  I don't think a German would run off the road and hide.  This aircraft was just taking photos.  Most soilders would fire at aircraft like this.
2)All the soilders when they are shot they all throw their hands up and do stupid moves.  This is so Hollywood.
3)You would think that with all the Big names here the acting would be alot better.  At times it seems that they are reading word for word from a cue card.
4)Again when the scene goes to others in a vehicle, it's all stage and looks chezzy.
5) In the part where the German combat Officers are in trailer that is being pulled by a Half-Track.  The camera pans by and shows the side of the trailer and the top vents are flipping open and close.  And then the camera goes inside to where they are meeting.  Now this trailer is only about 20 feet long.  But once inside it appears to be a large room.  But inside you see no vents flipping open and close.  And then the Commend Officers goes in a back room of the trailer.  Come on, are you kidding me.
6)In the scene where the tanks started to take over the field, the US GI's were jumping in the trucks.  One scene showed soilders throwing down their guns while they jumped in the truck, once again are you kidding me. And then there was a scene where the US GI's that were shot and died after they were captured.  When the camera started to fade out, you could see the US GI's starting to get up.
7)Another scene showed the German tanks rolling in a town and started to drive over some large logs.  And then 2 US GI's ran up and placed white packaged C-4 explosives on the lower front of the tank as it started to climb over the logs. And then the US GI's started to run.  As the camera zoomed in on the tank, there was no C-4 on the front its like it disappeared
8)There are to many scenes where models are used and it is very obvious.  I just can't believe that with all the hype of this movie then in the 70's. That this movie is nothing what I expected.  But this is my thoughts only.

If you watch the making of this movie from the extras, you would think that this is high budget film.  But I have seen 'B' movies that were better than this.  I was thinking that I would have another decent WWII to add to my collection.  But after about 20 mins. of viewing this I started to get bored.",1333756800,,2645,4.095330739299611

292347,4,6300268748,"Those interested in a realistic depiction of Germany's last major offensive operation of World War II, will probably be disappointed by The Battle Of The Bulge (1965), which does not accurately depict the snowy conditions under which the operation actually took place, and also does not feature any historical figures from the high command, such as General George Patton, British Field Marshal Montgomery, or anyone on the German side.  Putting those matters aside, the epic 167 minute long creative ""reimagining"" does contain some key elements of truth, and in some ways is an interesting and entertaining war adventure, with subplots that add color and depth, to the events on a large battlefront.

In December of 1944, Hitler believed that if peace with the Allies could be reached, he could then turn to the east and continue the battle with Russia.  The objective of the planned German offensive was to capture Antwerp, the capital of Belgium, split the Allied forces, and then look to negotiate peace.  In the film, the Germans have no thoughts of defeat, as they are seeking to achieve a great victory, to buy time to unleash advanced weapons they are developing.  The top secret offensive will be spearheaded by Panzer forces led by Colonel Hessler (Robert Shaw), a dedicated soldier who lives only for battle.  Procuring fuel for his tanks will be a priority, and German commandos disguised as Americans will be employed to help achieve this objective and confuse the enemy.  In the Allied side, the role of the British army is completely ignored.  US Army Lt. Colonel Kirby (Henry Fonda) is concerned that the Germans are preparing for an offensive, but his superior General Grey (Robert Ryan) disagrees, and the Allies are caught unprepared by the German attack.

The film follows Hessler's initial success, and his aggressive drive.  As the Allies recover and counterattack, Colonel Kirby assumes a larger role, and other characters emerge.  One is Lt. Weaver (James MacArthur) who is captured by the Germans, and narrowly escapes being executed by machine gun fire from the SS.  The second is Sergeant Gruffy, played by Telly Savalas.  Gruffy is a wheeler dealer type who sees red, when he believes that the woman he loves (Barbara Werle) has been killed by the Germans.  As he does in the war epics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B002M809JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>&nbsp;(1967), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-s-Heroes/dp/B00004RF9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly's Heroes</a>&nbsp;(1968), Savalas plays a key supporting character who adds a great deal of color and machismo.  This film just wouldn't be the same without Telly.

As the German offensive continues, it becomes clear that victory will hinge on the ability of the Panzer forces to get fuel for their tanks.  The actual battle took place in snowy conditions, which hampered the ability of the Allies to strike from the air.  In stark contrast, the movie's final conflict features a large scale tank battle on snowless terrain, with no planes in the sky.  Hessler `s forces are driving to reach a fuel dump, while a small group of American soldiers led by Lt. Weaver are racing to destroy it.  In the end, Weaver redeems himself, while Hessler refuses to give up his mission.

The film's lack of ties to any historical military leaders is kind of odd.  With the command of both sides in the hands of fictional characters, it further serves to undermine the already sketchy credibility of the film.  General Gray the Allied commander, is portrayed in a very poor light.  Besides Hessler, the German side isn't represented very prominently, except for the group impersonating American GI's.

Although containing many historical inaccuracies, The Battle of the Bulge is still a pretty entertaining watch, featuring some decent battle action, interesting tactical situations, and solid cinematography.  The solid cast also includes Dana Andrews, George Montgomery, Ty Hardin, and Charles Bronson.",1328054400,3,4108,5.4604430379746836

Produced in 1965, the film lacks computer-generated action shots but nevertheless does a great job in filming massive tank movements and battle sequences. Robert Shaw (best known for his roles in ""Jaws"", ""From Russia With Love"", and ""The Sting"") plays commander of the Panzer tanks and quite realistically.

The actual battle (of the bulge) is envisioned from the points of view of the commanding general (Robert Ryan), an intelligence officer (Henry Fonda), a tank crew chief (Telly Savalas), and a few GI's played by George Montgomery and Ty Hardin, with Charles Bronson playing an infantry commander.

292370,4,6300268748,"I very much enjoy this film.  It shows action on both sides of the front, including US and German forces.  The Germans mass a collection of top-notch officers, tanks and other material in order to make one massive push to split the Allied lines, capture a vital port city and huge stores of fuel and material from the Allies.  The attack is launched along an unlikely stretch of the front where the German force smashes what appear to be a few battle-weary US Army divisions.  That's the set-up for the film.

While there is time devoted to the attack and the defense, the main thrust of the movie appears to be pointed sparring between two colonels.  One (Fonda) is a police detective in civilian life, and he is increasingly convinced that the Germans are going to attack.  The other Col. (Andrews) is a career officer who has little time for Fonda's speculation.  Time and again Fonda sticks his neck out to try to uncover more clues that will help him figure out what is going on.

All in all, the movie is well paced, well acted, but I'd be hard pressed to say that it is a faithful telling of this battle.  Even so, it is engaging and I have watched is several times, and will certainly watch it more times in the years to come.

The title of the movie is really misleading as it is a fictional account that is loosely related to an actual battle.  The movie uses 50's era tanks to represent the German panzers, and they don't look anything close to the real one's.  There is little or no mention of the famous places or conflicts that took place.  Robert Shaw is great as the main Nazi commander, but he plays a fictional character named Hessler.  In fact, there is no mention of any real life names from the battle.  No Bradley, Patton, Peiper, Manteuffel or even Eisenhower.  The whole thing was very puzzling.  Still, for what it is, it's not a bad movie.  It has an all star cast with some good performances.  The battle scenes are good.  Just don't expect to go away from this having learned anything about the real battle.",1291248000,,975,4.415730337078652
292403,3,6300268748,"I saw this movie back in the early 70s.  As many have remarked, this is not the greatest war movie ever made.  It also has historical inaccuracies that make one gag.  The one thing that stood out then (and still does) was Robert Shaw's amazing performance as Colonel Hessler.  For me, the Hessler character personifies the ""ideal"" German military officer:  bold, fearless, driven, hard, ruthless, self-less, and.....just a little mad (which may help nourish the other qualities).  Despite those attributes, Hessler is not totally evil.  He has real contempt for the German High Command, especially when he finds out they are killing allied prisoners.  While he drives his men hard, he also shows compassion for them and even for some Belgian nuns.  The finale, where Hessler dies, manages to showcase all these qualities at once.  After watching Shaw's entire performance here, you forget that he is just acting--he is every inch the prototypical [Nazi] military officer.  The really ironic fact here is that Shaw himself was born to Jewish parents.  Chew on that one.  This movie is worth watching if only to see Shaw's phenomenal performance.",1289692800,2,1144,5.086021505376344
292404,5,6300268748,"Ok,for me it does not get much better than this! My Dad took me to see this back in 1965 when it came out. Over the years I have seen it on network tv,cable tv ,and thru VHS format! I was not all that picky about how super clear a movie could be until We got a DVD player about 8 years ago! Than I was a bit picky! Last Christmas we got a 52 inch Samsung Flatscreen 1080p for the family. Bestbuy threw in a free Blueray player along with it! So now I can never go back,I am having a field day! And yes I have gotten picky! We have 3 DVD Players ,one run of the mill! One that will play anything from all regions! and than the Blueray!
That being all said, I find the Battle of the Bulge in Blue-ray is outstanding!!It comes thru very clear and crisp! It looks like it was made this year! Everything really stands out! The sound is great too as is the soundtrack! If you want something that is 100% correct with History than you better see another version(like Battleground -1949) of this story! I will say this tho, regarding the movie being real,They use 80 real and at that time active tanks and 5000 extras out of the Spanish army to stand for most of the American and German troops! Nowdays CGI is used a bit too much! A good example is TROY with Brad Pitt and Eric Bana,it was a good movie but it could have been a great movie with less CGI and more extras!
I don't let the fact that the Battle of the Bulge is not 100% correct with history bug me when it comes down to it, as this flick just looks so good,has great action and a great cast! Robert Shaw as Col. Hessler, Henry Fonda as Kiley,Robert Ryan as Gen. Grey,Dana Andrews as an officer who gets it all wrong about the coming German attack and than later is a big enought man to tell Kiley he was wrong!,Telly Savalas as Guffy, The Head of a Sherman tank crew,Charles Bronson as an officer on the very front of the lines who later fights a holding action and stands up for his men when they are pows!,James MacArthur as an officer who does a 180 in how he handles his part in the battle due to what he went thru with his Sgt Duguesne played by George Montgomery,Ty Harden plays Lt .Schumacher ,a leader of a team of Germans who had lived in the U.S.A. but came back to fight for the fatherland posing as U.S. troops,and many more!
This film has somethings in common with a good western made 3 years later called Custer of the West-- 1. They are both made with the Cinerama process and I feel a Big screen TV in conjuction with a Blue-ray Player helps one still enjoy this process up to a point!2. They have a lot of the same cast. In Custer of the West Robert Shaw has the lead role as Custer,Ty Harden is Reno and Robert Ryan plays a deserter!
Thought that was interesting to point out! Some other things that I feel were realy good on the  Battle of the Bulge were 1. In the beginning of the movie were Col Hessler is showed all the dreams and ideas some of the German high command have along with some tanks and fresh troops to still try and win the war!2. The train scene 3. The first battle were the Americans were caught way off guard!. 4. The Battle scene were a large amount of German tanks are lined up with ground troops pounding away at the town they are attacking and than moving in!5. Col Hessler showing his commanding officer an American cake and telling him that things like that getting to the troops makes them feel they can do any thing! He wants to take the town he is spending time attacking so as to brake American moral!5. The final battle,  There is a computer game called Beyond Overlord that has this battle along with many others!
This movie has a running time of 169 mins. I hear a fair amount of people sometimes knock any movie that runs pass 2 hours! I for one, like em the longer the better as long as they are well made! This movie has some good extras like The filming of the Battle of the Bulge,History Recreated and others. Its Directed by the same Director who did The Longest Day Ken Annakin. Hans Christian Blech has a good part as an aide to Col,Hessler! The movie has extra music before the start,during an intermission phase and at the conclusion! By the way, that one reviewer has it wrong about Henry Fonda not using his gun,In the first battle He is shooting a German tank crew member!!
All in all I would have to put this movie in my top ten of World War 2 movies of all time!! I would say this movie is to be very much recommended !!",1280275200,4,4442,4.1820303383897315

292406,4,6300268748,"It's been a while since I've watched this movie due to the length (almost 3 hours) so this review is based on memory. This is a historical (as historical as hollywood gets anyway) movie based on the last days of WWI. The Germans were almost beat and the war was coming to a close so complacency set in with the allied forces. Only one man (Henry Fonda) was saying that the Germans will attack. In fact, the Germans were regrouping and had devised a plan to win the war. They had developed tanks that could withstand allied bombardment but only had enough resorces for a sixty hour campaign. The plan: to infiltrate and divide the allied forces. When put into motion, the plan was having success, driving the allies back as they were unprepared and unequiped to handle the new tanks. Henry Fonda finally figures out thier weak spots, the arigance of the German commander and fuel, and sets their own campaign in motion. This is a pretty good movie (and a bit scarey considering what's going on today) but I was a little disappointed in Henry Fonda's roll. You'd think he would have a more active roll, but he didn't do too much of anything. He's in quite a bit of the movie but he doesn't even had a gun and has to borrow one from Charles Bronson for a short period (though I don't recall him firing it). If you're looking for a good Henry Fonda movie, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a good movie about stategy, I'd highly recomment this one.

For those wondering about the quality, the Blu-Ray transfer is superb. The scenes are very sharp and clean.",1278720000,2,1565,4.491228070175438
292407,4,6300268748,"This movie has never looked better, it looks rather cleaned up and shines on blu ray. The acting is top notch for sure with major actors laying down good performances. Of course this is a 1960's war movie in which people fly apart or the war scenes look like you could do with cgi effects and other makeup techniques developed in the 1970's.  They use at the time modern tanks too but it is the spirit of the battle they are out to capture here and they do that in spite of it being rather bloodless. In truth war is about blown out guts and blood everywhere. this is like a idealized war , much cleaner and that's why it was such a hit at the time.  So I don't think you can criticize this movie on that regard because it was made during a different era of movie making.  The blu ray version is the best you will ever see of this movie and in spite of being a clean war movie it's still good and it gives you a feeling at least of how bad the battle was in reality.  Most of the cast is now gone but with great actors like Henry Fonda, robert shaw, dana andrews, robert ryan, telly savalas, and others you get to see them contribute to this good war movie from a premodern effects era.",1276992000,7,1186,4.099137931034483
292408,4,6300268748,"This is a movie that sorely needs to be redone.  Doesn't mean I'd dump my 1960s version and never watch it again.

Some things about this film are unbelievably bad-namely the WRONG tanks being used.  They could have made some mock King Tigers using plywood and duct tape for goodness sake...sure, the road wheels would have still been wrong, but it would have been better.  I shook my head while watching ""the making of"" film where they act like these armored vehicles were dug up out of museums across Europe to be used in the film.  AAAARGGH!  Probably the same Spanish army tanks used in making ""Patton.""

Positively the worst performance I have ever seen by Henry Fonda.  Charles Bronson was OK, but he seemed oddly detached from his character.  Robert Ryan brought nothing to the table as division commander and could have been played by anyone, and the Dana Andrews character (supposed to be a foil for the Henry Fonda character) was merely annoying.

Telly Savalas really shone in this movie.  He was such a great character actor.  He was at times funny, at times tough and gritty and though I usually cringe at the obligatory love interests they often threw into war films back in the day, his acting concerning his Belgian girlfriend was actually quite touching.

Besides Savalas, the Robert Shaw (Col. Hessler) and the Hans Christian Blech (Conrad) characters were outstanding.  These two really worked well together  Shaw was delightfully martial and arrogant and Blech was refreshingly human.  A shout out to Karl Rapp's (fake MP) acting in the film.

The worst part of the film was when the two howitzers were being brought up by rail.  It was painfully obvious that they were using miniature models and they sped the film up to a ridiculous speed while the train was moving down the tracks; also, were those electrical wires that were over the track?  The train they started with wasn't electric.

Probably the signature scene of the film was when the German tank commanders spontaneously began singing ""Panzerlied"".  Yes, back in the '60s soldiers would sometimes start singing (remember ""Zulu""?) for no apparent reason in war movies.  Only a draft-dodging hippie wouldn't find that scene to be pretty cool. ;=)",1276819200,,2226,4.88

Regarding the use of non-authentic armor, ( M-47 and M-24's)the film was shot in Spain and the filmakers use armor currently in the inventory of the host country. The best job I've seen with Tigers was Kelly's Heroes, where they used T-34's mocked up quite convincingly to be Tigers.",1255046400,3,826,4.587837837837838
292426,4,6300268748,"Two of the four stars are credited to the Blu-ray edition. For a movie this old, the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and the surprisingly bright and crisp picture, especially on the outdoors scenes should make it an almost mandatory upgrade from the DVD edition.

As for the movie itself... yes we all know that the Battle of the Bulge did in fact take place and that the Germans bet on the bad weather making the US air support near impossible. In fact, they premised their battle plan on bad weather. Strangely, the movie treats us with nearly 2.5 hours of mostly outdoor scenes done under mostly bright, crystal-blue skies after the German general explains that their surprised offensive was made possible by a couple of days of very bad weather. And it's not a low-budget movie, in fact, it was one of the more expensive war movies made in the 60's.

From an acting standpoint, more than Henry Fonda, Telly Savalas or Charles Bronson, this is Robert Shaw's performance. He is believable and, possibly to the chagrin of the producers, he comes pretty close to make the German colonel a rather sympathetic character. All the other first tier actors do a good job but Shaw eclipses them all as the square jawed, intransigent, unforgiving but strangely fascinating German warrior.

For extra features, the Blu edition comes with a contemporary trailer and 2 contemporary featurettes, one of the history of the Battle of the Bulge and the other on the filming of the movie, all three in 'low res'. The bombastic, wide screen, color trailer and the two black and white, 'narrow screen' featurettes I found actually interesting as time capsules of the 60's ways of promoting a 'super-production' of this 'never-seen-before' caliber.

While the Battle of the Bulge is inauthentic by reenacting a real military campaign with fictional characters and contrived scenes (for example, in truth the German offensive was not halted by the death of their commander and some of his tank crew members in a failed attempt to capture an American fuel dump), it is very enjoyable for those who like Word War II action, or action in general, especially now, in a digitial format.",1249344000,3,724,4.792
292430,2,6300268748,"Did I say ""funny""? Yes, indeed, this movie is often (unintentionally) hilarious - when it isn't being obscenely overblown and tedious, that is. Comedic highlights include:

1. Blatant historical inaccuracy. Now, I'm not talking about the kinds of things that only a history buff would notice (German Panther and Tiger tanks just happen to be re-painted U.S. M-48s...characters shooting heavy machine guns from the hip...officer and NCO paint marks missing from backs of helmets...) but stuff that simply rules out any suspension of disbelief: the entire battle depends upon continuous fog and snow, a point that is continuously and emphatically repeated by numerous characters throughout the entire film...and yet every outdoor shot highlights a crystal blue sky and blazing sun! The director could have at least kept the camera angles low so the audience could imagine that the weather matched the dialog. And exploding artillery rounds routinely wipe out entire squads 50 yards away (see below for associated histronics), while an entire tank turret is blown away and the major Hollywood star inside not only survives but so does his cigar.  Apparently, Telly Savalas's contract provided better protection against high explosives than steel armor!

2. Speaking of dialog, another source of humour is the brain-numbingly stupid script, with actors suddenly appearing from stage left, barking a random order like ""make sure every shot counts!"" before disappearing. A direct forerunner of the repeating gag in ""Airplane!"" when Leslie Neilson keeps appearing in the cockpit to tell the pilot ""We're all counting on you..."" Unfortunately, the resulting grins are sure to have long disappeared by the time the film enters its third hour.

3. Inexcusable continuity gaffs, like the close-up of soldiers slapping plastique explosive to an M-48 - ahem, I mean German - tank, cutting to a medium shot and the explosives are now no longer there - but the tank blows up anyway!

4. But the topper, hands down, is the truely awful acting. I'm speak not of the main characters like Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson, who do their best with the lines available (although Robert Shaw gets high comedy marks for a bad German accent that comes and gos throughout the movie). I'm talking about the bit players and extras.  Every exploding round results in every nearby extra dying by simulataneously throwing their arms up and taking a high-divingboard leap...

The overall PQ is good from a color, contrast and sense of depth perspective. However, there is a serious lens flare / fogging issue, these are terms other professional reviewers and users have used to describe the issue. It primarily occurs during indoor scenes but a great example of it is when the train is about to exit the tunnel at 1:37 into the movie. It also primarily occurs on the left side of the screen, I saw it numerous times in the lower left hand corner. It appears the image softens, flares, or fogs there on numerous occasions. I found it rather distracting and my eyes tended to look there for flaws which diminished the overall viewing pleasure of the movie. I deducted a full two stars for these flaws, they occur numerous times throughout the movie in varying degrees. This appears to an issue with the source since other users have seen this on the HD DVD version and regular DVD version. I do not recall seeing this on TV but then again that was in Pan and Scan 4:3 which would've have truncated the problem area. The issue is only a few inches in on the left side, the main center / majority of the image looks fantastic.

The Audio quality was OK; I realize it is a 43 year movie so I gave it a fair rating all things considered. The rears and subwoofer are utilized on occasion but most of the sound stage is up front and center which is probably due to the fact that the original source was a mono track.",1243209600,2,1595,4.425170068027211

  I do like the actors in this movie, but the background, tactics and overall unit organizations shown in this picture, were pitiful.  I can understand the equipment that had to be used to film this picture, but the dialogue could of been much more based on military reality.  I feel that all the sides protrayed in this picture were not done proper justice.  They were protrayed as a bunch of amatuers, fighting a war, like hollywood amatuers playing at war.

The amount of fogging that you see depends on the scene at the time. Scenes with high contrase or brightness tend to hide the fogging.

I also have the 2005 dvd version of the Bulge and it has the same fogging problem. I believe the problem is with the original master. So is there a good copy of the Bulge where a good Blu Ray can be produced? If not, can present computer technology clean up the fogging?

I enjoy the movie and the Blu Ray clearity. I am giving a 5 star rating for that. The 3 star is because of the fogging.",1225843200,4,834,4.110429447852761
292474,1,6300268748,"Let's get this out of the way, first. The movie has nothing to do with the Battle of the Bulge (the Ardennes Offensive) of December 16, 1944. It is one of a whole string of truly dismal action films set in World War Two that were churned out by the American film industry in the 1960's. In 1965, a Hollywood movie company hired some ""name"" actors, wrote a script suitable for a comic book, and rented the Spanish Army's M47 Patton tanks (the ""King Tigers"" of the script), and M24 Chaffees (standing in for the larger but unavailable Sherman tanks).
Real soldiers will either laugh or cry when they see this. The final battle scene where the plucky Americans defeat the German heavy tanks by rolling barrels of gasoline down a hill at them is unintentionally hilarious, as is the scene where Telly Savalas' tank has its turret blown apart, leaving Telly sitting there in in the open in his commander's seat without a scratch on him. And despite the fact that the battle is supposed to take place in a Belgian forest in midwinter, the final confrontation takes place in a desert for some reason (presumably a Spanish Army training facility).
If you just want to gawk at Eisenhower-era tanks tearing up the landscape, this movie is mindless fun. But if you really want to see an honest depiction of the Battle of the Bulge, there are far better films, most recently the ""Band of Brothers"" miniseries.",1225584000,11,1397,4.637096774193548

292490,4,6300268748,"When it comes to the film ""The Battle of the Bulge"", I feel one should seperate the generally epic and enjoyable film from its horrendous telling of history.
On the positive side, ""The Battle of the Bulge"" is a truely epic war film complete with a very suitable musical score and some talented actors.  Robert Shaw gives a very memorable performance as a German tank officer who enjoys battle while Hans Christian Blech does a fine job as his older, combat weary aide.  The actors portraying the Americans (Fonda, Bronson, Ryan, etc.) do a generally good job though overall Shaw and Blech steal the show.  While lacking the realistic gore of ""Saving Private Ryan"", this film does have some impressive battle scenes.  The massive tank battle near the conclusion is overall a superb example of filmaking.  While some models were employed in shots of tanks exploding, a lot of the action was filmed with an impressive number of actual tanks.  There is also a memorable scene of a German tank brigade advancing through a snowy forest just before the first battle scene.  Also, this DVD has some scenes that had been cut from a video version I had previously had and also has contemporary interviews (including Shaw), a theatrical trailer, as well as a featurette.
While the movie is fun to watch, its depiction of history is particullary bad.  As there were very few Tiger II tanks left and M-4 Shermans may have been hard to find, I see little problem with the film using M-47 Pattons and M-24 Chaffees respectively in their place.  In fact, some M-24 tanks saw service in Europe before the war ended.  That said, it was laughable to see one of the people interviewed say that they were using the tanks which actually fought in the battle (he should have known better though a very few M-24s may have been in the Ardennes fighting).  Also, tiger tanks (whether I or II) never formed brigades.  Battalions were the largest formations they comprised (the 501st was the unit that supported Piper's spearhead's breakout on December 17th).  Also, most German tanks in the Ardennes were either Panzer Mark IV tanks or Panzer V Panthers and not Panzer Mark VI Tigers.  Also, why don't the allies have air support in the final tank battle since the skies are plainly clear (the terrain in the scene is incorrect as well though I can see why the filmakers would want to film a tank battle on open country)?  To create suspense, the film makes it appear the Germans had a chance at possible victory.  In truth, their plan was almost surely doomed though they could have inflicted more allied casualties if some events had been changed around.
Anyway, if you like epic war movies, I recommend this one.  Just don't expect it to be historically accurate.  For those interested in a popular level discussion of the battle, I would recommend the original Osprey Campaign Series book on the Ardennes and a later book in the same series dealing with the Northern Front of the battle (I don't own the book dealing with the southern Ardennes).",1214352000,2,3022,4.734732824427481

This movie was completed after an 8-month shoot.

292520,4,6300268748,"This movie is set during the December 1944 German offensive in the west which came to be known as the Battle of the Bulge. The Germans put together a huge army and hurled it against four American divisions holding the Ardennes, a hilly area not believed to be passable to tanks in great numbers. American tenacity, as well as a timely counterattack by Patton's 3rd Army and the British-led army to the north allowed the offensive to grind to a halt.

In this production it seems as if the producers tried to find the least Bastogne-like terrain they could find. Also, the thick snow which caused enormous misery on both sides is nowhere to be seen in this film. However, the Battle of the Bulge does have some good acting and some interesting parts to it. The English-speaking agents were actually used by the Germans to disrupt communications and sow chaos (the ones who were captured were later shot, an surprising act of ruthlessness on the U.S. Army's part).

292524,2,6300268748,"Infamous as the war movie denounced by Eisenhower for its woeful inaccuracies, anyone approaching this movie should be well aware of its pitfalls.  However, if you can overlook them or at least partake with a generous pinch of salt, there are still some treats to appreciate.
The battle of the bulge was set in one of the bitterest winters on record in 1944, when the Germans used the bad weather to confound the Allies air superiority to launch a massive all out attack designed to splinter the Allies and change the course of the war.  As the disclaimer at the end of the movie says, this film is a highly compressed, fictionalized version of that, with all the characters merged and renamed.. in other words, it is a fictional version of what happened - and it shows.
The bitterest Winter is hinted at in a few moments of the movie as during the initial battles we see some pockets of snow and men stamping their feet to keep warm - however, as the movie progresses, the films actual shooting location in Spain becomes more apparent as we see dusty desert and sweaty men.  Worse, the two environments are poorly spliced together leading to woeful continuity, and almost the entire movie is plagued by incongruously sunny weather.  The tanks bear no resemblance to those used, and the grimness of war is covered over, with death conveyed in the old fashioned `throw-up-your-hands-in-the-air-and-fall-down-dead' approach to moviemaking.  Now that the movie is over, I am hard pressed to remember a single moment that actually showed blood.  One would think that having directed on `The Longest Day' (a far superior film) Ken Annakin would have learned some lessons in the importance of historical accuracy, and how it can bring an audience in.  Here, the contrivances which have Henry Fonda almost single handedly figure out the whole sequence of events and be in all of the major battle scenes, serve to disengage the viewer.
So that's the bad out the way - but in fact, from a one star movie, a sort of watchable movie is rescued thanks to two things - Firstly, the cinematography - shot in Ultra-Panavision, a process designed to give an epic widescreen image, enough to project onto Cinerama (a process which used 3 curved screens, and in its true form, 3 synchronized projectors, to create an all encompassing experience).  This movie has clearly been made with this process in mind, as scenes of trains hurtling along tracks and cars weaving down slippery roads are shown at some length from point-of-view angles... the end result is rather like watching a movie shot in 3D in its 2D form - the action seems contrived.  However, the aerial, crane and dolly shots in this magnificently restored version use the widescreen to dramatic and exciting effect, and should only be watched in widescreen...the reputation of this movie has suffered greatly from too many years in pan-and-scan format designed for the TV screen.
And secondly, the magnificent performance of Robert Shaw as the fictionalized panzer commander, based on Colonel Peiper - the youngest man to reach full Colonel in the German army.  His is a complex character, showing humanity to his aide, and passion for the process of war - and yet disdain for the hierarchy that sends him to battle.
Apart from Shaw, there are a few other moments which attempt to add some humanity to the proceedings, with heroism being forged from tragedy, such as the young lieutenant who survives the infamous (and historically accurate) massacre of prisoners at Malmedy, and becomes galvanized to lead the fight as a result.  However, the pluses are outweighed by the clumsy script, inaccuracy and dusty desert filling in for frozen Belgium.  The unlikely ending at the fuel dump serves as the nail in the coffin.
Has a certain boys-own appeal perhaps, or to watch to enjoy the incredible amount of Franco's hardware on display...but in this day of Saving Private Ryan and other of its ilk, an audience should expect much more.  Worth a rent perhaps, but not one to watch twice.",1194134400,,4028,4.862773722627737

292539,4,6300268748,"The ""Battle of the Bulge"" is a big budget war movie predating ""Patton"" and made long before the CGI-assisted ultra-realistic films like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  It largely succeeds in presenting a decent set of basic characters with some thematic elements to make a reasonably interesting retelling of a fairly complex and prolonged event, namely Hitler's last gasp gamble to fend off defeat on the Western Front in December 1944.  Unlike ""Midway"" (a terrible film), Henry Fonda is given some interesting things to do, and we get to see Telly Sevales before his comedic reprise in ""Kelly's Heroes.""

It's important to understand that ""Bulge"" really focuses (using some fictional reference points) on the several opening days of the campaign when a single panzer knifed through the Monshau Gap and achieved an early penetration before being stopped in the rugged hill country well north of Bastogne.  The most famous and dramatic episode is only briefly touched on, which was the enirclement of th 101st Airborne at Bastogne by the Fifth Panzer Army (superbly depicted in the middle sections of HBO's ""Band of Brotthers"")  The film gives the impression that the battle at most last a week; in fact, some of the hardest fighting occurred throughout January 1945 as American forces struggled to reduce the bulge.

High points:  ""Panzerlied"" (you will hum this for days to the alarm of your friends) and the ""Trojan Horse"" German paratroopers who created havoc in rear areas.  (The movie does not show the summary execution of the paratroopers caught with American uniforms).  The soundtrack is good (really good on home theater) as is the opening battle sequence of tanks storming through the snowy forest.  And the "" chocolate cake"" scene.

Flaws:  A few.  The Germans get big American tanks, [probably M-48s), the American get little ones.  The model work is haphazard; the scene of the model German tank poking its barrel into a model railroad tunnel and blowing up an HO train is laughable.  Most of the movie involves, as it should, hills, forests and deep snow, and then when the climatic tank battle occurs using real tanks, it takes place in....  a sagebrush, flat, snow-less desert.  Huh?  That doesn't like like Belgium to me.  And while fun to watch, no self-respecting panzer general is going to line up all his tanks hub to hub to bombard a town, no matter how cool it looks.

It was not necessary to cut corners on equipment: the later ""Kelly's Heroes"", a WW2 comedy, used real Shermans (lots of countries still used them back then) and some nicely simulated Tigers.  If you are going to do a movie based on a tank battle, try harder.  I am just not being ""nerdular"" about this.

And the thrilling tank battle at the end (Which didn't happen as it was depicted) is likely the best representation of this form of combat ever done in a movie.",1179014400,4,751,4.611940298507463

292574,3,6300268748,"Let's face, very few scenes in any movie are more fun that watching the German panzer commander try (and fail) to overcome rolling tins of gasoline the tune of ""Horst Wessel""  The symbolism is so accurate, and so silly, that it almost makes one giddy.  Fonda and Bronson are both excellent as the play, with straight faces, an American colonel in Intelligence (Fonda) and a roughneck American Lieutenant (Bronson)-- ""Heyyy, wait a minute"" says Bronson, snapping his fingers in the film's second most memorable moment -- Telly Savalas, however, steals the show as ""Joe"" a black marketing tank commander.

So, it's stupid, but the movie is FUN as it presents the Reader's Digest, Americanized version of a bloodless Battle -- that repeats every fabled anecdote of the battle, and boils them down to polished chestnuts.  To be fair, this movie was really intended (like How the West was Won) to showcase the new ""Cinerama"" dome and its big curved screen -- Imax before Imax.  So it has big scale effects, like flying along a train, and, oh yeah, churning tank tracks through burning American gasoline --

292578,5,6300268748,"Battle of the Bulge is probably the least accurate but most enjoyable of the spot-the-star WW2 roadshow epics. When Samuel Bronston's Spanish production empire crashed, his head of story Philip Yordan teamed up with former combat photographer Milton Sperling and picked up the slack with a slew of Spanish-lensed epics of his own backed with blocked US funds - Custer of the West, The Royal Hunt of the Sun and this lavishly mounted affair that took full advantage of all that WW2 Nazi hardware that found its way into Franco's possession. It's dominated by Robert Shaw's disillusioned but still fanatical eternal warrior with the rest of the characters fairly standard issue, although the individual scenes are far better written than is the norm in the likes of Anzio or Midway. Like the Bronston films, the script is a surprisingly intelligent affair, establishing an interesting set of battle lines, with Germany reduced to rubble, its people vanished and its armies living underground while the over-confident Americans are virtual tourists in liberated territories, more interested in the menu for Christmas dinner than intelligence reports of a possible offensive. Not that it is without problems: the geography, like the `history,' is more than somewhat suspect. Indeed, you can even catch a glimpse of the Forum Romanum set from The Fall of the Roman Empire in the background of the ""It can be done!"" scene as Shaw inspects the tanks. Add to that the fact that the production was plagued by good weather, so sequences are prone to go from blizzard to parched, and the result should be a mess, but it works well both as widescreen spectacle - especially the incredibly impressive final shot of hundreds of abandoned tanks - and as an archetypal Hollywood war movie.

Unlike the previous video and laser disc releases, this DVD is fully restored to its original roadshow length, and also features the original trailer, featurette and 1965 interviews with Robert Shaw and Milton Sperling.

And whoever thought to add that long train ride to nowhere into the film must have been on drugs. That scene should have been an extra in the feature section under deleted scenes (With good reason) because it was originally cut because it made no sense.

""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is more historically accurate - and believable.  There are so many fantastic true stories about the Ardennes Offensive that could've been told with this movie, but instead, they made up a complete fantasy story, filled with innacuracies from one end to the other.  Unlike other war movies of the period like ""Patton"" or ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"" or ""The Longest Day"", where film makers actually portrayed true events, this movie is over two hours of nonsense wrapped around tired cliches.  I've seen this movie a dozen times or more and every time it just serves to impress upon me what an opportunity they wasted in making the movie.

292610,3,6300268748,"THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE is one of those big budget war films that clearly try to portray a critical time during the Second World War when Hitler tried a last gasp hope of creating a stalemate.  Director Ken Annakin unwisely tries to balance a script that has too many subplots. The most glaring misuse of a major actor is Telly Savalas, who is shown to be a money grubbing Sgt Ernie Bilko, who later morphs into a dazed Rambo, who wants only to shoot Germans.  Then there is the conflict between Henry Fonda and Dana Andrews, both of whom argue incessantly over if and when the Germans will attack.

For a film which is supposed to be a slam bang actioner, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE is as unbalanced with the massed tank battles as with the distracting subplots.  Many reviewers have commented on the historical inaccuracies, yet these departures need not have diluted the impact of on screen tank warfare.  There are several minor scenes of lasting emotional power, some of which were cut from the VHS version.  These oft deleted scenes include the introduction of the Panzer commander Colonel Hessler (Robert Shaw) to his individual tank leaders.  Hessler walks into a large underground bunker where each tank leader snaps to attention as he walks by.  Then, incredibly, one of them bursts out with a rousing, foot stomping rendition of DER PANZERLIED in which all the other commanders quickly join in.  Their communal singing creates a subtext that suggests the enemy is not quite the inhuman faceless stormtroopers usually portrayed on the big screen.  In fact, when the film was shot, Germany was a good friend of the United States and the producers tried mightily to smooth over the troublesome spots.  Hessler himself was in reality SS Standartenfuehrer Joachim Pieper, a man of brutish behavior who was later declared a war criminal.  Shaw's version of him was more clearly in the righteous but noble Aryan hero that was often sung in Wagnerian opera.  Further, the film glosses over the Malmedy Massacre, where hundreds of GIs were machine gunned by Peiper's SS.  Hessler, by contrast, is shown as objecting to the shooting which was carried out without his knowledge or participation.  The other small scenes that linger in the mind are the delicate ones between Hessler and his driver, a war weary aged veteran (Hans Christian Blech).  Much of their interplay is conversational, with Hessler insisting that a stalemate between his Panzers and the Allies would be victory enough.  Blech counters with the understandably more human concern for the future of a post war Germany.  Still, BATTLE OF THE BULGE is a worthwhile war film. I recommend that you see the uncut version where a critical 23 minute series of scenes is uncut.  This movie is one of the few of its genre where the supposed bad guy (Hessler) is not the bad guy at all. There is really very little difference between Shaw and a later George C. Scott, who immortalized a similarly fanatical tank commander.",1129939200,2,2978,4.826771653543307

292612,1,6300268748,"I remember enjoying this as a kid, but then as soon as I developed any critical faculties, this movie failed the grade. Regardless of the obvious abilities of many of the actors in the film, nothing can redeem it from the complete and utter fabrication of actual events, something quite unforgivable in this genre, at least when it purports to represent historical fact.

Firstly, the real BotB was essentially not a tank battle fought over open countryside over fuel. Neither was it fought in anything resembling the vehicles portrayed, or the soldiers for that matter. It was a grizzly, cold and deadly last throw of the dice on Germany's Western front fought out in the claustrophobic villages and woods of the Ardenne. It brought the Western Allies a small taste of the horrors being played out in the East, though generally not through some kind of systematic cruelty as the film suggests, but through the extreme and desperate situations many of the combatants on both sides found themselves in. The actual battle represented many things, including the biggest surrender of US troops in history, and the complete incompetence of Hitler as a tactitian. These make no showing in the film.  And of course it involved one of the greatest moments of pure pig-headed heroism in WWII (I refer here to the 101 airbourne's stand at Bastoyne), which at least does get a look in.

The actual battle, while costing many lives, never had the tactical implications Hitler expected, or the film suggests. It delayed the western onslaught, but after initial successes, the German offensive was soon bogged down and awaiting its inevitable destruction by US and UK airpower and armour. If anything, it drained Germany of the resources it needed in the East, and therefore shortened the war.

This film is a mockery of reality and the lives that were lost or ruined during this battle. Its just junk.

To get a taste of how this film could have been (from the US perspective at least) see Band of Brothers.",1126569600,7,1994,4.852941176470588

As for the movie itself, Henry Fonda doesn't get much of a chance to shine, even though he's the main character. Telly Savalas is always a trip. He has the only good role besides Robert Shaw. And the only role with any romance.

I'm having trouble playing this movie. It pauses in parts and won't skip to different topics on the main menu. I'm playing it on my computer, so that could be causing those problems.

292615,4,6300268748,"Battle of the Bulge is an exciting WWII movie depicting the famous 1944 battle that makes up in action what it lacks in accuracy.  In December 1994, the Allies believe the war is all but over and are preparing to go home.  The Germans are planning one last offensive that will hopefully turn the tide of the war.  The German army breaks through the unsuspecting Allied lines in the Ardennes, but can the outnumbered American divisions hold back the the German advance?  The history here may not be the most accurate, but as the movie states, time has been compressed.  Overall, the battle sequences are very well done on an epic scale with the exception of a few scenes during the tank battle where some very obvious miniatures are used.  Not the most accurate WWII movie, but they got the idea right with American troops standing their ground in hopes of stopping the German advance.

  In a cast full of big names, Henry Fonda gets top billing as Lt. Colonel Dan Kiley, an intelligence officer who is convinced the Germans are planning a major offensive.  The versatile Robert Shaw plays Colonel Kessler, the ruthless German commander of the armored spearhead.  Robert Ryan and Dana Andrews star as General Grey and Colonel Pritchard, two Allied officers who don't believe what Kiley tells them.  The huge supporting cast includes George Montgomery and James MacArthur as Sgt. Duquesne and Lt. Weaver, two soldiers who escape the Malmedy massacre, Ty Hardin as Lt. Schumacher, a German paratrooper disguised as an American MP, Charles Bronson as Major Wolenski, Hans Christian Blech as Corporal Conrad, Hessler's aide, and Telly Savalas as Guffy, the tank driver/entrepeneur trying to make a buck.  The DVD includes the widescreen presentation of the movie, an unusually long theatrical trailer, and ""The Filming of the Battle of the Bulge"" and ""History Recreated,"" two excellent featurettes made during the filming of the movie that contain some great cast and crew interviews.  A long overdue DVD that is a must have for fans of the movie.

  The best part of the DVD is that the movie clocks in at just under 170 minutes.  For the longest time, the available versions cut a lot of footage that have been reinserted back into the movie for the DVD release along with intro music, an intermission, and exit music.  After seeing the movie several times with almost a half hour cut, it is really great to see the movie as it was originally intended.  Highly recommended.",1120435200,,2471,4.852028639618139
292616,3,6300268748,"Mildly entertaining, this movie lacks in so many areas I don't know where to begin. I like to watch war movies to relive my days in the Army (I was in a tanker unit for awhile), and this movie just loses all realism and historical accuracy to the point that it resembles a circus. I saw it as a kid and liked it of course, and viewers who aren't so discerning might actually like it also, but watching it as an adult who has already watched the greatest war movies ever, I now have to give a thumbs down to this flick.

 There are no unit patches on any of the soldiers whatsover. Obviously the studio must have had to cut costs somewhere. The German Tiger and Panther tanks suspiciously resemble American made tanks, the acting is so horrendous and hollywoodish, that I actually found myself rooting for the Nazis to kill them so I would no longer have to listen to their phony imitation of real soldiers over and over. Yes it was a big budget film and yes they did assemble a very all star cast, but did any of those actors ever spend 15 minutes trying to learn how actual soldiers act and talk? Actors are supposed to be believable in their roles, and this group just couldn't do it. They obviously didn't even know the right military expressions or jargon at all. Example: One of the generals making a call to HQ asks for ""One hundred and fifty fives"" (Howitzers), which to my knowledge has always been called one five fives (especially over a radio). Small error though it is, to me it's enough to remove any belivability  that the actor has ever spent a day in uniform.

 The special effects are laughable, but you do have to remember the era in which this movie was filmed.  High explosive tank rounds only cause a puff of smoke on enemy tanks followed by gasoline being lit on the turret.  Dont expect to see turrets flying off as would be the case, oh and, soldiers don't bleed when shot either.

 The end of the movie was so preposterous that I couldn't help but chuckling as Henry Fonda and Savalas rolled barrels of gasoline towards an entire column of German tanks and then tossed grenades at them and singlehandedly won the Battle of the Bulge.

 This movie just seems like a sorry excuse to put Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas in other movie together to attempt to entertain the public.  I'll stick to ""Band Of Brothers"", ""When Trumpets Fade"", ""The Thin Red Line"" or even ""The Big Red One"", when I need my WWII fix.",1116979200,,2432,4.428251121076233
292647,4,6300268748,"Warner Brother's 1965 epic war movie that portrays the German Ardennes Counter-Offensive in December of 1944 during WWII.  Battle of the Bulge depicts Adolf Hitler's gamble that committed three German armies to attack west to Antwerp, Belgium, and halt the Allies to force a negotiation for peace.  Producer Milton Sperling and Director Ken Annakin created a movie of grand scale, but apparently chose big-screen action over historical precision to maximize box office revenue.  Long relegated to infrequent television play and a chopped video tape edition, it returns on DVD restored for movie fans who like tanks and a screenplay that borders on camp by contemporary standards.

The movie depicts this historic battle through several fictional characters that eventually meet in a climatic battle that seals the Germans' fate.  Henry Fonda is Lieutenant Colonel Dan Kiley, an American intelligence officer whose warnings of the coming attack fall on deaf ears.  Robert Shaw is Colonel Hessler, the charismatic German Panzer (tank) commander who leads the armor spearhead towards Belgium.  Charles Bronson is Major Wolinski, a tough American commander fighting the German onslaught under severe odds.  Telly Savalas is Sergeant Guffy, a jaded American tanker who is in the thick of the battle facing superior German tanks.  James MacArther is Lieutenant Weaver, a slack infantry leader who survives a massacre of Allied prisoners by German soldiers.  Sperling and Annakin appear to have chosen this simpler screenplay to create a few heroes who fight to overcome a seemingly invincible villain, forgoing a complex storyline as used in 20th Century Fox's 1962 Longest Day.  It works OK, certainly not on the level of Band of Brothers, and lends a somewhat campy appeal for this 1960's action flick.

The movie does portray actual events with German paratroopers disguised as American soldiers who disrupt Allied operations, the Malmedy Massacre, and the siege of Bastogne.  Their depictions contain a lot of artistic manipulation, and the relatively simple storyline faults the German defeat to depleted gasoline reserves, setting the stage for a climatic battle when Kiley, Guffy, and Weaver find themselves face-to-face with Hessler at a gasoline dump.  Another gross oversight is a massive tank battle in the latter part of the movie that was apparently filmed during the spring-summer season in Spain - deplete of snow.  As long as viewers don't mind these faults, this is an entertaining movie.  The M24 Chaffee and M47 Patton tanks rented from the Spanish Army serve well as representations of American Sherman and German Tiger tanks, and the live sets look great on the wide screen.  Robert Shaw is the most charismatic in this feature and the Panzerlied chorus near the beginning of the movie is memorable.",1116374400,20,2814,5.287640449438202

This is a great World War II battle spectacle, with good acting from Telly Sevalas, Henry Fonda, and others.

This was a pretty high budget film, and it shows.  The sets and tanks are very realistic, and the German Panzer brigades look real.  The battle scenes are fairly realistic, although as a former tank commander myself, I could spot a few inaccuracies (World War 2 tanks almost never fired their guns on the move--they were not gyro-stabilized and thus could not hit anything if the tanks were moving). The German ""Tiger"" tanks are really American tanks.  (Not like there were many Tigers left, even back when this film was made.) No matter, the battle scenes were very enjoyable and well done.

The storyline is only roughly accurate, and departs significantly from the historical facts of the real Battle of the Bulge.  This is unfortunate, as the real story, with the incredible and heroic defense of Bastogne by the US 101st Airborne Division and with General Patton wheeling three divisions 90 degrees to head north and relieve the 101st Airborne at Bastogne, is an even more heroic story of American arms than this story is.  Nevertheless, this film is a fine story and very good entertainment.

This is a big Hollywood spectacle that was designed to be solid entertainment, and it succeeds.  The DVD is an excellent value, with very good Dolby sound and crisp, bright colors.  It looked and sounded terrific on my home theater system.  Enjoy.",1115251200,17,1627,4.788530465949821

292652,4,6300268748,"I was a kid when I first saw this.  It amazed, even in the trucated 2-part presentation on CBS years later.  Since then I have always tried to catch a presention, late night, or on WTBS or AMC.  Bought the tape, on Beta no less.  However, it didn't have those Ultra-Panavision shots I remembered.  Hell, it was missing whole sequences.  Much later TCM presented a letterbox version that took me back to those childhood memories, though it was still missing stuff.  You know, those ugly, sudden, obvious cuts that even throw off the music.  Then I got the LaserDisc (remember those?) though it turned out to be the same version presented on TCM.

Now, I know now that the flick is historically crap, but a soft spot always remained.  All those tanks, nobody believing Fonda, that creepy yet rousing Panzer song,  Ryan playing the old guy we all wanted to grow up to be, and Savalas keeping his contract to be in every WWII movie made in the 60's.  It is Hollywood crap, but it is cool Hollywood crap.

So here we are now in a new century and The-Powers-That-Be have finally gotten around to releasing this classic on the still viable DVD format.  Complete with Entrance and Intermission music, complete with most of the missing sequences.  Shaw argues with Bronson, Hardin freaks Shaw out, Montgomery argues more with MacArthur.  All in decent Surround sound, too.  It's not Cinerama, but, until that Cinerama theater in Seattle decides to present it on the curved screen again, I think those of us that hold fond memories of this flick will finally be happy.

There is some interesting material included in the DVD with the Theatrical Trailer, Interviews with the Director and Robert Shaw and also a short Black and White film is shown on how it was filmed including footage of the German military advisor who insured an accurate detailing of uniforms, events, etc. in this basically fictitious account of the famous battle of world war 2. Now what needs to be said is that this is a polished transfer of the widescreen film. The overture is put back and all of the extras that were usually cut. Including the ""Panzerlied"" gathering of tank commanders that is sometimes missing from television broadcasts as well as the ""save the son but shoot the father"" scene. The musical score by Frankel is one of the best made in a war film presentation in a full orchestra by the New philharmonic. They have restored the original soundtrack to the DVD and it is impressive for a movie that was made in the 60's. Someone cared about putting this one back together and it shows! Graphics, scenery, etc. are all very impressive.

Seeing it again now, it is as if I were back in that movie house and as if time had not moved on. A GREAT release! Worth it to any fan of this film.",1115078400,191,1445,4.456603773584906
292654,5,6300268748,"This concerns the DVD.  The rest of the review is taken from my war movie web site: [...]

I picked up Warner's new release of BATTLE OF THE BULGE today, which is finally on DVD.  Fans will LOVE this disc.

First off.  The video print has been fully restored.  Colors are right on target, the image is sharp and free of edge enhancement.  There is hardly any damage.  It looks like it could have been filmed recently!

Even better, it's presented in the PROPER 2.75:1 aspect ratio of the Cinerama exhibitions.  The versions on TCM and laserdisc were 2.20:1.

The audio is an English mix using the original music and sound effects, remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1.  It sounds FANTASTIC.  The tanks, the gunfire, the dialogue, the Frankel score - wow.

Ok now for the best parts.  Most everyone knows that in 1984, when the film was released on video, it ran a mere 141 minutes.  Then in the early 1990s it was re-released at 156 minutes.  Well, that's still not full length.

This disc runs 170 minutes and includes all four famous missing scenes PLUS another one which expands the conflict between Ty Hardin and George Montgomery - a scene which nobody seemed to know existed!

Extras include a 5-minute trailer packed with alternate takes and dialogue snippets that never made it into the final cut.

There are two grainy black-and-white features about the making of the film which are inconsequential, but for a 1965 film, I think the extra material is quite substantial.

This classic finally got the right treatment.  THANK YOU WARNER BROTHERS!

This big, bloated epic re-creation of the battle which turned the tide of World War II manages to be on the most historically inaccurate and over-blown adventure pieces ever produced. It's also one of the most entertaining war movies to grace the big screen. The combination of heroics and history shouldn't work as well as it does.

Writers John Melson, Philip Yordan and Milton Sperling remain faithful to the broad outlines of the real battle, and then fill their story with several important fictional characters, and director Ken Annakin uses a combination of Hollywood heroics and historical accuracy to deliver an entertaining tale. The film relies solely on the excellently-shot action sequences and superb acting by the leads to hold it together.

Veteran director Ken Annakin knows how to make this film work. In the lead, Henry Fonda (""Midway"") seems to be having plenty of fun as Colonel Kiley. He gets to argue with people, shoot at Germans, fly in a plane, and even help fend off a Panzer attack - not bad for a civilian-turned-soldier, eh? On the flip-side, Robert Shaw (""Force 10 from Navarone"") is fantastic as the fanatical Colonel Hessler, a devoted Panzer officer who will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Hessler brings new meaning the Hollywood-Nazi-type: he's brutal, nasty and dedicated despite the fact that he knows Germany cannot win the war.

The supporting cast is filled with the familiar faces of Charles Bronson, Ty Hardin, James MacArthur and Telly Savalas - but the real star is Hans Christian Blech (""The Longest Day""). As Conrad, the war-weary, aging German Corporal, it's his best work in a war film. Conrad wants to go home and is devoted to Hessler, until he realizes that his commander's dedication sits precariously on the edge of madness. His facial expressions - bug-eyed outbursts, sad frowns, frightened glances at strafing airplanes - have never been more convincing.

This epic was shot for the big screen using Cinerama, and the only way to appreciate the action sequences is to see this movie in widescreen. Pan-and-scan prints cut it down from a 2.7:1 ratio to 1.33:1 - that's losing more than half of the image! It was shot on the vast plains of Spain, and although it looks nothing like the brutal winter in the Ardennes forest, this scenery makes from some very impressive landscapes for which to shoot colossal battle scenes. Annakin shows tanks facing off with each other on the plains and in the snow-encrusted woods and shows hand-to-hand fighting in the streets of a French city. These scenes are set to an excellent, rousing Ben Frankel score, which only adds to the excitement. There are hundreds of extras running about, as well as several dozen loud, clanking tanks. Annakin often places his camera on the front end of a tank, train or moving car to give the viewer a ""you-are-there"" perspective, a technique which is ruined with the pan-and-scan process.

The dramatic effect of the serious scenes is severely hampered by preposterous Hollywood heroics and some incredibly poor special effects. Quite often, the combat and destruction look incredibly real, but there are some truly laughable shots of exploding model tanks and roaring model trains, too. The battle scenes, notably a huge tank vs. tank battle and a conclusion involving an attempted German capture of an Allied fuel dump are incredibly corny and false-looking, adding a forced jingoistic feel and over-reaching heroism which really destroyed the credibility Annakin had been working up to. A strong subplot involving an American tanker, Guffy (Telly Savalas, ""The Dirty Dozen"") and another, centering on the Malmedy Massacre, help to offset this cheesiness.

""Battle of the Bulge"" is a true Hollywood epic in every sense of the word. It may not be historically accurate, but it's probably the most entertaining and engaging war film I've had the pleasure to watch. The characters are fleshed out, the scope is amazing and the direction borders on brilliance.",1115078400,7,5544,4.956803455723542

But at least Warner had the good sense to restore it to its original length.  They had cut out many important scenes from the VHS version that were restored to this DVD.  For that reason I gave it 4 stars.  There are not many extra features, only two brief featurettes on the making of the film, and a theatrical trailer.  If you just want to watch a war movie, make some popcorn and enjoy.  If you want a history lesson, watch the History Channel.",1115078400,,575,4.317757009345795
292656,4,6300268748,"After languishing in VHS hell for what seems an eternity, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE has finally made its' debut on DVD. The most important thing to know is that the movie is shown complete, so there is no longer the need to watch the cut version which appears on television and the VHS tape. The picture quality is very good and Benjamin Frankel's great score now sounds fantastic! (By the way, as an aside, the complete score of the movie can be found on the CPO record label). The original overture, intermission, and exit music are also included in the film.

Now I'm not going to waste time picking at the historical nits that are in this filmed rendition of the Battle of the Bulge. People need to remember that this was not a documentary, produced by the HISTORY CHANNEL, but a Hollywood movie. Those historical arrogant critics of the film need to take a deep breath and simply enjoy the film for the entertainment value that it offers. For example, you will not find too many war movies that have such a large scale armor battle that is shown at the climax of the film which I still find thrilling to watch. Yeah the German Panzers are not authentic but who cares? It is fun to watch despite this.

So take advantage and watch this fine war movie with a pristine clarity transfer and great sound. Highly recommended",1115078400,6,1321,4.5

For all the historical inaccuracies, it tells a compelling tale that is true in spirit if not in fact. Such an epic could not be filmed today. Though SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is in many ways a superior film, you see the budgetary restraints (one Tiger tank, reused in different shots, one German halftrack used in three different scenes). In BATTLE OF THE BULGE, director Ken Annakin opted for action and spectacle and the result is indeed epic and spectacular. This film might be more influential than you know. George Lucas cited the World War II films he watched growing up as the single biggest influence on his STAR WARS series. Compare the action in BATTLE OF THE BULGE to the Hoth scenes in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK--very similiar, with the Imperial Walkers doubling for German tanks. And is it any coincidence that the director of BATTLE OF THE BULGE shares his name--Annakin--with a certain fallen Jedi? I think not.",1113177600,5,1017,4.784090909090909
292679,5,6300268748,"This is an excellent war film. It is one of my favorite films and I look forward to seeing it whenever its on. I highly recommend this film and for this reason, I'd like to take a moment a clarify a general misconception about this movie.

The critical comments from previous writers to this review page claim that this film, The Battle of the Bulge, is not historically accurate. These critics then go on to site the numerous historical errors in the film such as the misrepresentation of the massacure of American POWS during the battle. I will state quite frankly that these critics are all correct. This film is full of historical errors. You military historians can now rest on your lorals knowing that you are correct about the historical errors in this film and that I have admitted fully to those errors and justified your position.

Now, it is time for a little reality check.

This film was made by Hollywood. Hollywood makes ENTERTAINMENT, not historically accurate films. So called ""Historically accurate films"" are seldom historically complete as claimed and seldom bring in the big money at the box office. If you want historical accuracy, watch PBS or the History Channel. The Battle of the Bulge is pure hollywood. That means it is pure ENTERTAINMENT; and entertain is what it does beautifully. For 170 minutes, the viewer is glued to the screen, drawn up into the story and its strong characters, the excitement and tragedy of the battle, and the awesome tank battle scenes. What more can anyone ask for?

This movie is great entertainment and deserves a five star rating. Viewing it as an ""historical document"" is both unfair and unrealistic. See the movie for what it is, entertainment, and enjoy.",1113177600,5,1716,4.826530612244898
292680,5,6300268748,"This is a great historical film.  It shows how closely fought

the battle against evil was in WWII and how our greatest

generation responded to it.

The film stars Henry Fonda as an all-american Lt. Col.  He

is hard working and dedicated.  But his superiors are not.

They are chair-warming politically ambitious regular army

types who usually got undeserved promotions to general.  Henry

Fonda gathers up the intelligence to show that the germans are

planning a sneak attack, but the generals don't believe him.

On the other side is General Von Killowitz.  The traditional

bloodthirsty prussian officer who loves war and death more than

anything.  He is the same sort of German who the Romans guarded

their frontiers against 2,000 years ago.  Savage, without

culture and only loving war and pillage.  Killowitz is given

huge tank army and told to go capture the gasoline of the

American army.  Killowitz isn't expected to win the war, but

to get Germany enough gas to keep it going until they finish

their rockets, jet fighters and WMDs.  Once the WMDs and the

other new weapons are finished, the germans will destroy all

freedom and conquer the world.

Because of the general's incompetence, the US Army is caught

by suprise by the sneak attack.  The germans take advantage

of the situation and revert to their usual barbarism.  They

kill prisoners and everything else you would expect.  But

after the attack, Fonda manages to find a fighting General and

using his intelligence reports on the german plan, they plan

a strategy to stop the germans.

Henry Fonda knows that Von Killowitz is in charge of the german

army and that the germans are running out of gas.  So the

general carefully plans to win by destroying his own gas

supplies before the germans can capture them.

While the Germans have the upper hand for a little while,

they just end up culling out the poor soldiers from the

American Army.  Then the real battle starts with the

real americans who have been hardened by war into pure

fighting machines.

Telly Savalas plays a tank commander whose brilliant leadership

and understanding of german tank tactics allows him to destroy

lots of enemy tanks.  He was a real soldier.  In those days,

men fought with what they had (even if it was a wrecked tank).

Things are really different today when soliders whine about

not having every vehicle armoured in Iraq.  But thats what you

get with a so-called professional army.

The movie comes down a final showdown.  Von Killowitz's secret

american-speaking patrols have captured a large supply depot

and while Killowitz is racing there to refuel, Henry Fonda

shows up and discovers their plan.  After killing all the

Germans, they improvise an attack on the germans.  With real

American initiative, they use the very fuel the germans want

to capture as rolling weapons against the Tank Army of Von

Killowitz.  He slows and then halts the advance of the german

tank army.  The tanks are slowed just enough that they use

up their remaining fuel.  Von Killowitz and his dreams of

war are stopped just short of victory by a handful of GIs.

Von Killowitz burns to death in his tank.  Killed by the gas

that might have given Germany the world.  His remaining army

has no choice but to abandon their tanks and march home to

germany.  We then see Von Killowitz's closest follower turn

his back on war and german militarism by throwing down his

weapon.

The film ends with a dramatic shot from the air of the

battlefield.  We see how close Von Killowitz came and how

his dreams ended in a mass of burning and out of gas tanks

covering the dry arid lands of Belgium.

This is great for history fans and as an educational resource.

I would recommend in addition ""Patton"" which shows the other

half of the battle.  Battle of the Bulge doesn't tell the story

of how the fighting of the war was messed up by Montgomery.  Or

how Patton was held back from finishing Germany off.  All that

fuel the germans were going after was fuel that was kept back

from Patton and just piled up in supply dumps because Montgomery

was more interested in his own glory that working as part of a

team.

292681,4,6300268748,"By December of 1944, the Germans, still reeling from the Normandy invasion the previous June, devised an intricate and desperate plan to strike the Allies along the weakest part of their lines near the Ardennes forest.  On the morning of December 16, 1944, the Germans unleashed their attack against the unsuspecting Allies.  This movie describes the fighting that took place.

Henry Fonda stars as Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley.  He is the only one in his unit who believes that the Germans are actually going to attack.  This belief places him in direct conflict with his superiors.  However, as the movie plays out, it turns out that he was exactly right in his assumptions, and it is his superiors who are apologizing for doubting his instincts.  Robert Ryan stars as General Grey, the American commander who's job it is to stop the German advance.  Using intelligence gathered by Kiley, General Grey discovers that the Germans are running dangerously low on fuel, so he develops a plan to halt the German advance by destroying their fuel depots.  Robert Shaw stars as Col. Martin Hessler.  A German Panzer commander since the Polish Campaign of 1939, Hessler is the best panzer commander the Germans are able to throw at the Allies.  He is a brilliant tactician, although he is accused by his subordinates of being ""married to the war""; meaning he wants to fight on forever if possible and stay ""married"" to the military.  Charles Bronson stars as Major Wolenski, whose infantry are assigned to support the American armored attack on the Germans. Telly Savalas stars as Sgt. Guffy, a tank commander and travelling salesman.  He is a superior tank commander and his tank crew score several kills during the course of the movie.

I thought this was a good movie, but I also felt that it was Hollywood's interpretation of the battle, and some of the scenes were pure fiction.  For example, the scenes where the American troops are rolling burning barrels of gasoline into enemy tanks is a little hard to believe, and the use of Cold-War vintage American M-48 Patton tanks as German Tigers was a little disappointing.  However, there are some extremely realistic scenes as well, such as the Germans machine-gunning a group of American POWs.  I recommend this movie not for its historical correctness, which admittedly is lacking in some points, but for its entertainment value.  The combat scenes are very good and the acting is well-done.  If you are a history buff, then you will probably be disappointed with the way some of the battle scenes play out, but for pure entertainment value, this movie is very good.",1112054400,5,2607,4.884090909090909

292683,4,6300268748,This movie is not historically accurate. It is an Hollywoodized treatment of World War II. There is a star-studded cast and this is a very interesting movie of about 3 hours.

292684,3,6300268748,"I don't have anything to add about the faults of this movie other than to mention that there are enough present to distract me. Specifically the lack of historical accuracy, the lack of snow, the clear weather in Spain where they filmed it that wouldn't have allowed the panzer divisions to move like they did due to Allied air attacks, the inaccurate (anachronistic) armor, etc. The Battle of the Bulge was portrayed more accurately in the Bastogne portions of Band of Brothers, and even in the movie Battleground with Van Johnson - I love the GI WWII period slang banter.

With new technology, and the trend to portray battle more realistically in movies like When Trumpets Fade, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and even the Lost Batallion, this movie is begging for a modernized remake in the style of Spielberg.

Even with this movie's faults, I have enjoyed it in the past.  If the flaws were corrected, this could be a great movie, so, cmon' Steven Spielberg, remake this film. If Hollywood can remake something as vacuous as Fat Albert, then why not this one.  The story has a lot more potential.",1106092800,3,1110,4.7357512953367875
292685,5,6300268748,"This film was first released for the special ""Cinerama"" Widescreen theaters of the late 1960's, where the screen was oval and reached to each side wall of the theater. The intent was to give the movie goer the feeling of being in the picture. The Battle of the Bulge was filmed for these theaters. An example is the beginning car scene as the observation plane flies overhead, there are camera shots as if you're the driver, especially in the turns. The same with the allied train with the artillery rushing to the front, you have camera shots as if you are on the train track.

This movie isn't exactly historically accurate, but it is still one of the greatest war epics ever done for the screen and it still holds up well today. You have the vast battle scenes, the stores of several soldiers and officers of their experiences in the battle, realistic landscape and weather, and the music makes it all come together in a great story from both sides. This movie made the mold that later great war films followed, like Patton and a Bridge Too Far.

What I don't understand is why all the versions I have seen on VHS and Turner Classic Movies (TMC), where you expect the original un-cut version of the film, are missing several scenes from the theater release. Some estimates are 20 minutes of the film is missing, which I would agree. I also don't understand why it is taking so long to get this movie on DVD when lesser war movies have been done. In 2004 it was the 60th Anniversary of the December 1944 battle, a perfect time for a ""Special Edition"" DVD that restored this epic movie to it's original theater version plus extras on one of the most famous battles in the history of warfare.

The VHS version is still worth owning and viewing and the missing 20 minutes does not effect the greatness of this movie. We can only hope that the DVD will be out soon, and give future generations the full experience of this movie we all enjoyed when we saw it in the theater with our dads who were World War II veterans.",1103414400,5,2016,4.457994579945799
292686,4,6300268748,"BLU-RAY REVIEW
I am updating this review (Dec. 9, 2008) to address the Blu-Ray edition of this movie which I feel is worthy of praise. In addition to a very impressive 1080p high definition picture which has nice contrast, vibrant colors and a fantastic level of detail (just witness the Christmas tree and flags in the first scene between Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan), the Blu-Ray also boasts a scene specific audio commentary featuring Director Ken Annakin and actor James MacArthur.
The two are obviously very good friends and the commentary strikes a nice balance between technical details, preproduction and filming background and friendly chatter. I found it enjoyable.
The Blu-Ray also transfers over the two vintage featurettes and theatrical trailer found on the DVD, but the addition of the audio commentary and the superior high definition picture makes this an easy recommendation for an upgrade from the subpar DVD format.
I read the concerns over ""fogging""n some of the previous reviews and did not notice it on my Blu-Ray, except in instances when it was obviously a deliberate decision. For the most part this is an impressive presentation. For those wanting the check out the HD picture, the high definition premium commercial-free TV channel HDNet Movies has been showing ""Battle of the Bulge"" in HD recently.

In the 1960s it seemed to be all the fashion for a host of big name actors to appear in World War II movies. From THE LONGEST DAY to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE and BATTLE OF BRITAIN  every big name actor made his appearance in big epic war pictures commemorating a war that, at that time, was still fresh in the memories of many.
From the extremely realistic (as much as Hollywood will allow) such as THE LONGEST DAY, BATTLE OF BRITAIN  and (to a lesser extent) THE GREAT ESCAPE to the more Hollywood-ized versions of the war represented by THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and THE DIRTY DOZEN the quality of the movies was unquestionably epic in nature with varying degrees of historical accuracy.
Somewhere in-between the examples above falls BATTLE OF THE BULGE (1965) which purports to illustrate the events of the winter of 1944 in which the Nazi powers sought to separate the American frontlines from their supplies and reinforcements. The movie works well as far as mindless action entertainment and we have some truly great performances by Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas and Charles Bronsan, but it seems as though the script writers threw the history books in the trash and decided to write the battle as they would have liked it to have played out.
The result is some truly shocking historical inaccuracies. Firstly, the movie suggests that the Germans were running low on fuel and were desperate to capture Allied fuel depots. In fact the Nazi's had enough fuel for the offensive but suffered due to supply lines that were constantly being bombed by Alied aircraft.
The Malmedy Massacre is portrayed here as an organized slaughter of American GI's. In fact, this was not the case. The massacre certainly happened, but it was more of a spontaneous affair.
Another historical inaccuracy is in the portrayal of the German armor. The movie gives the impression that the assault was carried out exclusively with King Tiger tanks when in fact many more Panzer tanks were  utilized in the offensive. Germany it appears did not have an overabundance of King Tigers.
Compounding the movies historical difficulties is the creation by the movie makers of characters to lead the German and American divisions. Most blatently obvious is the character of Col. Hessler (played by Robert Shaw). In fact the officer in charge was a Col. Joachim Peiper. The movie makers also created a fictional character - Lt. Col. Kiley - for Henry Fonda and a Gen. Grey for Robert Ryan and totally ignores the role of Gen. Patton in the struggle.
Where the movie gets it right is in the Battle of Bastogne, the use of English-speaking German special forces behind Alied lines to mess up logistics and the fact that the American forces were hopelessly overextended.
However, if you are not looking for a history lesson and instead would just like a comic-strip style action movie, then you can do a lot worse. Growing up and seeing this movie on television I found it exciting and exhirating. Taking top honors in the acting department is Robert Shaw as the cold and grittily determined Hessler. The scenes between him and his subordinate Cpl. Conrad (played by Hans Christian Blech) show the deep conflict in 1940s-era Germany between the fanatical Nazi's determined to carry on the fight and the regular citizenry who, although patriotic, wished only for an end to the conflict. The scenes are poignant and revealing and represent some of the best scenes in the movie.
Overall this movie is flawed, but its still enjoyable and thought provoking.",1095897600,140,4881,4.919902912621359
292717,1,6300268748,"Terrible dramatization of the Battle of the Bulge: the 1944 German winter offensive in the Ardennes Forest in Belgium. Not only is virtually every character and event in the film fictional, the film completely omits various important historical facts to suit its distorted plot.

  Although the Germans were running very low on fuel supplies by 1944, the main purpose of the offensive was to separate the extended and delapidated US frontlines in Belgium from their supplies and reinforcements in hope that the Allies would then sue for peace. It was a very far-fetched plan, but Hitler wasn't known for his military genius. The film is correct in showing that the winter weather made air operations impossible and, that US troops were horribly overextended. The film also includes the Malmedy massacre, German special forces dressing up as GIs to foul up logistics, and the famous defense of Bastogne. The film is completely off as to everything else. The Germans weren't heading for a fuel depot nor did they burn in their tanks in an effort to seize it. There was no Colonel Hessler in charge of the SS Panzer division: it was Colonel Joachim Peiper who had that role and he wasn't a standard Wermacht officer. The film completely omits the role of General Patton in this campaign and instead focuses on a fictional and totally unbelievable character played by Henry Fonda. Finally, the film makers do a great job at showing the audience how Germans drove American Vietnam-era tanks instead of Panzers: tanks that are shown fighting in the dry and hot deserts of Southern Spain instead of the dense snow-covered forests of Belgium.

  A very bad movie that has all the qualities of a cheap and hurried film. The acting is mediocre and the story almost complete fantasy.  Unfortunately, there hasn't been a good movie made on this particular battle: I hope one is made at some point soon to divert audiences away from this poor substitute.",1090886400,14,1941,4.899390243902439
292718,4,6300268748,"I won't bother to dwell upon the historical inaccuracies this film suffers from such as armour and terrain. These have already been pointed out countless times before by critics far more knowledgeable and astute in such matters than myself.  I will say that this film does succeed in other important details. It's depiction of American troops - some veteran but many inexperienced - completely overwhelmed by a ferocious enemy tank assault; a desperate Nazi high command forced to gamble all its resources in one last offensive; the fanaticism of SS units as seen in the massacre at Malmedy and the Skorzeny infiltrators; and finally the much more prevalent weariness and despondency of the average German soldier portrayed by Wolfgang Priess.  I seem to remember hearing somewhere that Henry Fonda's character was meant to represent the cautious General Montgomery who warned of the possibility of a German counter-attack while Dana Andrews was to be a stand-in for the much more aggressive General Patton.  Robert Ryan was a personification of the studious and analytical Omar Bradley weighing all the facts before making his final move.  It's Robert Shaw, however,  who steals the show as the amoral Panzer commander fighting not for the Nazi Reich or its twisted ideals but rather for his own love of war and battle (perhaps not too much unlike General Patton.)
I was truly heartened to read in a previous review that Warners is releasing this film on DVD.

292720,3,6300268748,"Battle Of The Bulge is coming on DVD - next year! This was revealed on The Digital Bits Home Theatre Forum during a chat with Warner executives recently. No other details were given as it was a general answer to a question about Warner classics in the pipeline - but it's definately on the way.
It would be nice to see the film get the Special Edition treatment, but quite honestly the complete version of the film in a decent anamorphic transfer with a 5.1 soundtrack would suffice.
The question of the correct aspect ratio is a tricky one. Battle Of The Bulge was filmed in Ultra Panavision. This system used a 65mm negative with a slight anamorphic compression. This meant that when projected it had a maximum aspect ratio of 2.76:1. However, films in this process were rarely displayed at more than 2.5:1, as many theatres hadn't the capability to project any wider. The DVD of Ben Hur is presented in 2.76:1 and looks beautiful on a large widescreen TV, but it must be painful to watch it on a 4:3 TV of average size.
However, aspect ratio aside, the important thing is that Warners give us the complete 167 minute version of the film, containing the overture, intermission and exit music, and not one of the butchered versions of recent years. Let's hope that they're listening!",1080259200,14,1284,4.635964912280702

Everybody who writes reviews thinks they're an Historian...
IT'S HOLLYWOOD DRAMA, NOT INTENDED TO BE A DOCUMENTARY!
The Basic history is correct: The Germans were excellent
warriors in the face of great odds against them; German panzer crews esp. in Tigers were elite troops,had a special Espirit de Corp, there are only a handful of the legendary Tigers left and they could make mince meat of ANY allied tanks; they were vulnurable to their support systems;they were in desperate need of fuel; they did abandon, but usually destroyed their own tanks,..

292723,4,6300268748,"I remember this movie vividly from childhood.  It both scared and impressed me at the same time.  Robert Shaw as Hessler (Jochim Peiper) was really an impressive performance.  The movie is jumbled history at best, which is admitted in the closing credits.  Still, it conveys some impression of the confusion, and desperate nature of the early fighting in the Bulge.  The use of the modern tanks is unfortunate, but probably because of the numbers needed they could not get enough authentic models.  The film sports an all-star cast which should satisfy celebrity fans.  At least we have a serious WW2 war movie here, not fantasy or slap stick comedy. Actually the scenes with Telly Salvalas as the tanker running a black market provide the comedy relief. The movie shows how badly the Americans were initally surprised, and shows the power and superiority of the late war German tanks.  Shaw is chilling as Hessler, a nom-de-plume for the real Jochim Peiper, the SS tank commander who spear-headed the attack. His role was not as big as this movie would make us believe.  The exicution of GI's at Malmedy was carried out by his men and is shown correctly in the film.  While a pastiche at best, this epic still converys the general desperation of the battle.  The ending I thought was typical Hollywood kill the bad German bit, but what can you expect.  The best scene is early on when Hessler sings ""Panzerlied"" with his young tankers to try and build comradeship among them.  Numerous scenes have been cut out from this movie which is unfortunate.  It stands to use a DVD re-issue with all the cut parts restored.  While not as great as some epics, this film belongs right up there with the ""Longest Day"" ""Battle of Britain"" genre of war films.",1069113600,2,1746,4.735099337748345

The only thing accurate about the film is that Germany was at war with the United States, and Allied Forces were stalled near Bastogne.  After that, the story seems to take off in a direction that has very little to do with what actually took place.
Better films would be ""Battleground"" with Van Johnson, the ""Band of Brothers"" series, or even ""Kelly's Heroes"" (which has more to do with the Hammelburg raid, but it's still better than ""The Battle of the Bulge"").

We all enjoyed the film then, but seemed to develope an even deeper appreciation for all of the films` nuances, subplots and seemingly perfect character developement, with accompanied high drama and excitement, after our third and fourth viewings! So, whats not to like???????? Just because some staunch military sticklers can attempt to criticize the less than authentic large weaponry and battle landscapes,does not diminish this thrilling, well written and superbly directed War film. This film is unique ,in so far as you find yourself alternately feeling sympathetic BOTH for the Germans and Americans at various  parts of the film. Ty Hardin`s German-American ""plant"", The Panzer fight song, George Montgomery`s heroic model to the frightened and inexperienced James Mac Arthur,The funny scenes involving Telly Savalas, the tense animosity between Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda, and the contrast between Robert Shaw`s character and his attendant officer/attache are all brilliantly depicted with many of these actors giving some of their finest performances ever. The most important concluding statement that I can make about this film, is that it is one that you can watch 3, 5, 7 or 10 times and NEVER get tired of it! Plus, one tends to pick up on new subtleties that could have been missed on the first few times viewing this film. Given the fact that it is rare for any War film to be listed among the all time great films, from a cinematic, ""Bergmannesque"" perspective;nevertheless, for the genre, this is a GREAT FILM!

If you are looking for this movie to be completely historically accurate then you are in the wrong place. But the director never intended for it to be an accurate representation so it should not dissapoint you too much that everything is not according to Hoyle.
Where the current version falls apart is in all of the missing scenes that have been cut out of the video. It is very frustrating to watch a movie you like and find it chopped to pieces. We just have to hope that this once fine movie will be re-edited back to its original format and be released on DVD soon.

292782,4,6300268748,"When you watch this movie, you must, as has historically been the case with movies, suspend the connection with the real Battle of the Bulge.  As has been pointed out by other reviewers, the intent of the movie was not accuracy, but entertainment.  So let's be blunt and then get into the rest of the review.  For accuracy, the movie gets 2 stars, which may be a little generous.  For entertainment, it gets 4 stars, as a war movie, it gets 4.5 stars.  Consider this a war movie ""inspired"" by actual events.
Now that we have that over with, we can review the rest of the movie.  This movie is interesting as a fictional war movie set during an actual event.  As the German war machine was slowly and inevitably backed into a corner by Allied forces from all directions, Germany decided on a bold stroke that could potentially prolong the war, and might potentially allow them to bring higher technology weapons into the conflict.  In The Battle of the Bulge Germany expended the vast majority of military resources remaining to it, knowing that losing the battle likely meant a quick end to Nazi Germany.
So we have German armored divisions thrusting through Allied lines, seeking to divide the Allies, and hopefully retaking enough territory and destroying enough Allied assets to at least turn the tide temporarily in the favor of Germany.  However, Germany was not exactly flush with natural resources, and this movie hypothesizes that in order for German armored divisions to proceed, they would need to capture a significant supply of fuel to keep their tanks fueled without long supply lines.
On the German side, we have Robert Shaw and Werner Peters, both of whom are well-known for a variety of other roles.  On the Allied side, predominantly American, we have a cast of actors who were either well-known then, or certainly are now, including Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, James MacArthur (Hawaii Five-O), the beautiful Pier Angeli, Dana Andrews, and many more; certainly a who's who kind of cast.
With all this acting horsepower, the movie has to have entertainment value, and it does.  If you can suspend your belief regarding the equipment used, which has been a problem for Hollywood movies as long as there have been movies, then this is a popcorn kind of movie.  The action is good, the bad guys are really bad, the good guys are really good, and we all want to get up and sing the national anthem at the end of the movie.  I've seen this movie so many times I'm surprised I don't know all the lines, and I still watch it.  Of course, I keep watching ""Top Gun"" even though it is even MORE unrealistic from a technical standpoint than this movie.
Consider this movie sort of like a role-playing game that was inspired by a real battle in a real war.  You know who's going to win, and you can even figure out which characters are going to die.  However, remember that this movie was made in the 1960s, when special effects and accuracy were a lot less valued than today.  Two interesting points about this movie: first, President and General Dwight D. Eisenhower denounced it after its release.  Second, it is one of the most popular movies for members of the United States Army.  Having been stationed in South Korea in the Air Force, and having been one of the people who liked MASH, even with its stretching of the truth, I can understand why military people would like the movie, even with its inaccuracies.
This movie is enjoyable and fun.  Do not mistake it for a documentary, or for any real level of accuracy.  You will have to read several books or watch a documentary to get the truth about The Battle of the Bulge.  Do get a bowl of popcorn and a soda and prepare for entertainment from the days when you could more easily tell the good guys from the bad guys and the good guys nearly always won, even if historical accuracy had to suffer a little in the process.",1036800000,3,3886,4.617732558139535

troops rolling flaming oil drums onto the hapless yet merciless
panzertruppen. in fact, the particular fuel dump represented in
the movie was simply by-passed by the germans because they didn't
know where it was. there is no mention of some of the ""forlorn
hope"" stands put on by small groups of americans even before the
stand at bastogne which, as far as the movie is concerned wasn't very significant. unfortunately this movie is advertised as the

And it can be enjoyed on a no-brainer level, simply as a good cartoon war movie. However, I can't state strongly enough that the standard VHS version of this movie has been edited down to the bare bones and is almost unwatchable. If you want to see the film as it was released in theatres in 1965, you have to catch it on television -- most stations broadcast the original version. There are about six important scenes missing from the VHS, most notably the whole battle of Ambleve, in which Bronson directs the defense against Shaw's panzers, and later faces down with him over rumors that he and the other American POW's may be executed. Nothing about this film is remotely realistic, especially compared to movies like ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Das Boot"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- but it is interesting the moreso because when it was filmed (1965), Hollywood was still churning out this kind of romantic, ain't-war-heck pap....Vietnam not having added the cynicism we see in later movies like ""The Bridge At Remagen"" which was made just four years later, in 1969. ""Bulge"" is essentially a fairy tale about the real Battle, about which -- inexscusably -- no realistic movie has yet to be made. If you can get the the full version, give it a try.

Charles Bronson did a decent job of playing an American Major captured by the Germans, but the ""Fuel Dump"" scene where ""Hessler"", a very loose composite of Jurgen Pieper and certain other German officers, gets roasted by a rolling fuel drum is pure (...), and it misrepresents the scale of the battle. It wasn't just a little shootout over some gas, as the movie would have you believe. Throw in a wooden performance from Henry Fonda and you've got a grade C production from Hollywood.

292819,1,6300268748,"This is big-budget battle action at its silliest. Robert Shaw is the weary Panzer leader who's just certain Germany's going to lose the war; in fact, he won't shut up about it. Yet, for some reason, he gets to lead Hitler's last big offensive against Henry Fonda.

Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas lend a hand, and Mannix gets in on the action at the Malmedy massacre. This is one of those movies where some characters have almost supernatural fore-knowledge of coming events, while others a blitheringly stupid. In fact, it's a lot like Irwin Allen's 70's blockbuster ""The Towering Inferno"" with Fonda in the Steve McQueen role- seems he knows exactly what the Nazis are going to do, but no one will believe him. Man, if he's that smart, why isn't he leading the Allies instead of Eisenhower? And Shaw- what a sour role. The guy can act (rent ""Jaws"" and see), but here, he's saddled with one of those prescient , somber Nazis hack moviemakers always hand you when they want you to feel halfway sorry for the guy.

Somehow, the whole war ends with all the characters converging on a fuel depot through a series of ridiculous coincidences, Fonda and Bronson shoving burning oil drums at a bunch of remote-control 1/35th scale Nazi tanks and Shaw burning to death- but he could've lived if he wasn't one of those obsessive lost-cause Don Quixote types.

292820,3,6300268748,"THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE is a great war movie.  It contains everything you could hope to find a cinematic military classic:  Action, tank battles, outstanding pyrotechnics, superb cast, and wonderful soundtrack.  Before I continue I want to make it clear that movie THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE should not be confused with the historical Ardennes Offensive.  THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE is essentially an action-packed cowboy and indian movie with the Americans as the cowboys and the Germans as the indians.  If you watch the film with this understanding you will enjoy it much more.

For the first time, possibly ever, the complete film is presented on DVD in wide-screen.  Scenes that have been missing for decades have been restored to the film.  Now you can see Lt. Col. Hessler marching between the parked rows of tanks, Hessler's introduction to the English-speaking commandos, the Belgian sniper scene, Charles Bronson's confrontation with Robert Shaw in Ambleve, and the lieutenant (James MacArthur) and his sergeant watching the German advance from a snowy hilltop.

This version is truly wide-screen.  In fact, when I premiered this new DVD release, with myself as the sole audience (as my family immediately fled the room), I was amazed at the width of the picture.  During my first screening of this edition, I tended to pay more attention to what was going on to the right and to the left of the main characters.  This additional perspective, in many ways, makes this almost a new movie.

The DVD is equipped with special features.  The movie trailer has been restored and includes alternate takes and dialogue that were not included in the original film.  Additionally included are two black and white featurettes on the making of the film. It is also amusing that in one of the featurettes the producer is under the mistaken impression that his production team was using actual German Tiger tanks.

THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE was filmed and released in 1965.  The movie was still in theaters well into 1966.  Remember that BULGE is historical fiction.  If you are looking for an accurate overview of the epic struggle in the Ardennes, pick up a good book on the subject.  Unlike other historical fiction, such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which take place in an accurate historical setting, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE begins with some degree of plausibility and devolves into an action-packed shoot `em up.

Do not misunderstand me.  I like action-packed shoot `em ups.  In fact, when I returned home from combat in DESERT STORM, the first movie I put into the VHS player was THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE.  The bottom line is that this movie has to be judged on its own entertainment merit.  Military history is not this film's best suit.  However, it has curiously been adopted by many as the definitive story of the battle.  It is fascinating to note that many Army Advanced Course captains have screened THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE as a shortcut to prepare group presentations on the 1944 - 45 conflict.  In the early 1990's, when I was in Europe putting together an Army staff ride tour of Battle of the Bulge sites in Luxembourg and Belgium, my battalion commander insisted that I include the hilltop ""... where the Americans rolled the fuel drums down on the Germans.""  Once again, history and Hollywood locked in mortal combat.

I did not originally see THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE in a movie theater.  It was not until several years after its release that I saw the wide-screen version of this film during my school district's summer film program.  Even though there was something odd about seeing a winter venue film on an outdoor screen on a muggy summer night, I was hooked.  What a great movie.  Unfortunately, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE became a time-compression casualty when it reached television.

In the greater New York City area, CBS broadcast THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE every year.  In the mid 1970s CBS relegated the movie to its late night lineup.  In the 1980s that same cut of THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, complete with CBS' old film splices, found its way to TBS.  The film's next stop was a shortened version airing on THE HISTORY CHANNEL and AMC.  The recent DVD release finally corrects the injustice done to decades of editing.

Critics of the film have long pointed out that real Sherman and Tiger tanks were not used in the filming and that the Spanish terrain southeast of Segovia and just outside of Valsain does not replicate Belgium.  Even in the mid 1960s whole fleets of Sherman tanks were difficult to come by and the only running King Tiger tank is housed in a French military museum.  As for the location shooting economy comes into play.  In the 1960s Spain was the place to shoot war films and television series.

You could spend days critiquing this film, but I recommend that you chase the critics out of the room and just sit down and enjoy the movie.  Make sure the sound is turned up high.",977788800,72,4908,4.729093050647821
292821,4,6300268748,"I've read a lot of the reviews from those who did not like this film and they do have a point about historical accuracy.  The tanks, the fact that virtually all the characters are fictitious, the innaccurate weather (didn't it snow just a little bit during the Bulge:)--you'd never know by watching this film because you're about 2 hours into the film before the first snowflake falls.
Having said this, in my opinion, this is the best film made on the Battle of the Bulge--although there have been some very good documentiaries done on the subject.  I noticed a lot of other people who reviewed this film, cited 1949's ""Battleground"" as a better film on the fighting in the Bulge.  I have both films and personally, like ""Bulge"" better...more action, filmed in color, and done more as an epic WWII film in the same vein of ""The Longest Day.""  i.e., it focuses on ""the Big Picture"" whereas ""Battleground"" focuses on one small unit.  I liked both films but ""Bulge"" was just a litlle bit better done, though Van Johnson is great in ""Battleground""
So, if you want total historical accuracy, get ""Battleground"" or better yet, the excellant PBS documentary on the Battle of the Bulge, part of the ""American Experience"" series, they also did a good one on D-Day.  But if you want a rousing WWII flick which at least captures the spirit of the Battle of the Bulge and features some excellant acting by the likes of Fonda, Robert Ryan, a young Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, and even the guy who played Jack Lord's buddy on ""Hawaii Five-O"", the buy this flick!",976233600,,1553,4.670329670329671

A lot of tanks and actors  are mobilized for making this movie more watchable and various kinds of  american as well as german characters play their roles successfully! Many  war movies use small amount of materials for battle scenes in order to save  money.  But in this Hollywood epic, a lot of extras, tanks and military  equipments make audience feel interested.  Additionally, the story that  German panzer brigade with new Tiger tanks attack GI troops after long  series of defeat is very interesting. Of course, there are some flaws in  this wonderful drama. For example, M-48 tanks doesn't look like Tiger tanks  in the eyes of such a war-movie fan as me. None the less, many battle  scenes appeal to my sense of reality compared to other films.

If you are a real war movie fan, I want to  recommend you this movie with all my heart!",961632000,2,1227,4.434977578475336
292825,3,6300268748,I enjoyed the original release and would hope the DVD (if there ever is one) is unedited.  My favorite part of this movie is when the Germans sing Panzerwagen Lied which is also the music played during the opening titles.  I've been looking for the soundtrack since it came out in 1965 and have yet  to find it.  It existed at one time on LP.  Hopefully some day there will  be a CD that includes both versions of Panzerwagen Lied.,955843200,,431,4.325
292826,2,6300268748,"What a Lame Movie! .Whenever i see it on TV during channel surfing my crindge! Historically inaccurate,terrible acting. The tank battle special effects are something out of a Godzilla flick. When i saw the Panzer  Leader(Robert Shaw)riding atop a painted over ""American tank""I  wanted to scream! Dont buy this movie!",952128000,,316,5.3
292827,3,6300268748,"Don't understand why the German part is always cut out from this movie, where Robert Shaw is being briefed by the General and ends up seeing his tanks and Shaw saying ""It can be done!"".  I truly hope when the  DVD comes out that it will include EVERYTHING that was in the original.  I  want to see ALL of it (seems weird how they cut that part out in every  video I've seen).  Tends to lessen the drama.",941673600,2,403,4.102564102564102

7807963,3,6300268748,"Even as a kid watching this back when it came out, it struck me as underwhelming that the German offensive was stopped by rolling a few drums of gasoline into their advancing tanks. Watching it as an adult, I was irritated by how Fonda's character is always at the right place at the right time and the allies victory is virtually due to his actions. Mr. Fonda was an authentic WW2 veteran but I'm also irritated that every time he shows up he gets it exactly right as to what the Germans are up to by constant coincidental circumstances. At one point he decides on the spot he needs to get one of these new panzers so he just walks up to one and drops a grenade into it, then listens to the undamaged radio broadcast vital intelligence to him! I was actually hoping at the end that the plane crash had taken our plucky hero out , but no-here he comes hobbling out on a crutch to direct the fuel camp soldiers in how to take out the advancing panzers thereby turning the tide of war. As if that wasn't enough, you have Robert Ryan as the retreating general who suddenly decides to stop and heroically face the Germans which only gets a French town totally destroyed with enormous civilian casualties...and then he resumes his retreat in the morning. Mon Dieu! I did, however, find some good in the movie. George Montgomery has a great character who is onscreen too briefly. More time with him would have been a more interesting movie. And Robert Shaw! He alone is worth watching this film. Great performance!",1524182400,,1508,4.487272727272727
