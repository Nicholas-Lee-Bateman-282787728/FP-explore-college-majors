8299387,5,B001ERFR24,"This is the 7th video in my collection.  Every time I think they can't get any better, they get better.  This introduction to Seattle was fabulously produced, written and narrated.  I have a concise ""mental map"" of Seattle, thanks to the video.  Being a father of two children, I am truly grateful for all of the ""kid friendly"" activities that were suggested in the video.  I am really looking forward to my next chance to make it out to Seattle with my family!",1257379200,6,461,4.506024096385542
