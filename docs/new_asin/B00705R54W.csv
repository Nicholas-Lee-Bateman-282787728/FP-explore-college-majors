8507540,5,B00705R54W,"Jean-Michel Pilc explores difference way to think about improvising solos. The old saying is improvisation is spontaneous composition and Pilc's expands on that showing how to treat soloing more like composition and building on your themes and rhythms.  Jazz Heaven DVD work because they are like you sitting in the back watching a friends lesson, in the video Pilc works with a student answering questions, having student try concepts, and demonstrating the ideas.  My collection of Jazz Heaven DVD is growing they are an important part of my study of Jazz and every time I watch a DVD I pickup more things to think about or practice.  Highly recommended.",1402617600,,656,5.0
8507541,5,B00705R54W,"I have a library of instructional material, literally.  Most are variations on a theme - play this scale here, this chord here, this lick here.  This one is very different.  While there is some discussion of technical aspect of playing, the focus is on developing musical intuition.  He gives practical examples of how to 'un-learn' all of the rote programming and tap into the melodies that are unique to you as the performer.  He is a funny guy as well; a great presenter of information.  The production of the material is as good as you will find anywhere, which is typical of the Jazz Heaven products.  The sound and video quality are perfect.

In a nutshell, if you are looking for something to supplement the normal improvisation material and help you get out of your head and into your heart, this is it.  Well worth your time.",1402531200,,834,4.619047619047619
8507542,5,B00705R54W,If you are like me you went to school and studied books about jazz improvising. While that can be helpful I feel that it leads to several problems---the worst being not really being able to improvise or feel connected to the music you are making. I believe this video gives some great advice on how to break free from academic improvisation and move into personal expression.  Good Luck,1402272000,,386,4.676470588235294
8507543,4,B00705R54W,Refreshing approach. Out of the box. Nice to hear and see a player of this caliber really get into the depth of the music and share  honestly very encouraging . A benefit for sure. This is a new learning process for me.,1343520000,2,219,4.214285714285714
8507544,5,B00705R54W,"I just heard about Jean-Michel Pilc a few days ago, and my friend recommended jazzheaven.com to me and I went for it. The video is great. It's like a lesson, which you'll have to watch over and over and over again, because there is just so much information to grasp. The interview is equally as informative, and I can't wait for the upcoming videos. Jazzheaven.com can easily become a leader in Jazz Education (Catalyst as Pilc would say) in the near future. Keep up the great work!!",1328054400,2,483,4.563218390804598
8507545,5,B00705R54W,"Jean-Michel Pilc is an incredible musician, and this is an incredible dvd. A master musician describes to you what goes on in their head while they perform, and then describe how they achieved that ability, then they give you concrete examples of how to do it. Perfect.

I am a third year in a jazz school, but I have no doubts that this material would be very helpful to a beginner as well.

I'll be watching this dvd many times over, I'm sure. It's remarkable, Pilc in essence explains everything one would need to become a functioning jazz musician, and he does it in 2 hours.

If you get this video and disagree, watch it again. I'm sure the answers are there.",1327622400,3,664,4.426229508196721
8507546,5,B00705R54W,"Those looking for advice on what scales to play over chord changes should look elsewhere. This is a lesson on instant composition and orchestration. By the end of the lesson, you should have a good idea about the path Jean-Michel Pilc took to arrive where he is now. He will provide new ways to challenge yourself harmonically, melodically and rhythmically. He will show you how to think like a bass player, and drummer and a pianist all at the same time. His examples are simple and accessible but extremely convincing.  Get this if you want some new ways to develop you ear and start thinking like you're a band.",1327276800,2,614,4.63302752293578
8507547,5,B00705R54W,"This is a fantastic Dvd that sets the bar in Jazz insructional videos. It focuses on the an area of improvisation I have never seen in any other Jazz instruction, that is ""What needs to happen internally to truly improvise"" It has simple clear examples of exercises that you will not find readily elsewhere. Really great stuff!!",1327190400,,328,4.771929824561403
