8136051,3,B000H2NHDS,"GUTHY-RENKER's VHS of BOB HOPE'S CHRISTMAS WITH THE TROOPS is a heavily-edited one-hour version of an in-color NBC-TV broadcast that originally ran 90 minutes without commercial interruption. The 1/16/69 ""Bob Hope Christmas Special: Around the World with the USO"" had lots of Bob, plus lots of entertainment. What's left after a heavy G-K axe is mostly Hope's monologues and kidding with troupe members or military guests.

Sadly, here's what you DON'T get on this tape: Ann-Margret, Rosey Grier, the Golddiggers, Honey LTD., songs, skits and other fun.

8136052,5,B000H2NHDS,I gave this as a gift.  The person loved it.  Received promptly.  Great price.  Thank You.,1312156800,,90,4.4375
8136053,5,B000H2NHDS,"This is an outstanding souvenir item for those like me who saw the 1968 Bob Hope Show with Ann-Margaret.  I caught it at Indianhead Stadium near the DMZ in Korea.  It was always amusing to me, being in radio, that AFKN was going to carry the show live on radio.  The broadcast was piped in over loudspeakers as we waited and the DJ kept mentioning that due to technical difficulties the show couldn't yet be carried.  The technical difficulty was that Hope was not there.  He was on the DMZ shaking hands with GI's before getting to the stadium.  Hope may not have measured up in the late 60's with contemporary comedians, but he was an icon in the military...so you happily went to the show.  Good summary compilation on this DVD.",1203811200,,731,4.492424242424242
8136054,3,B000H2NHDS,"well packed and arrived in good shape, recording quality was poor, but still a great slice of history for those who experienced it, great gift to veterans",1200441600,,154,4.7407407407407405
8136055,5,B000H2NHDS,"Exquisite, this DVD is an excellent portrayal of all that Bob was and is.  The ribs, one-liners, and the charm are what make this DVD great.  His interactions with one of the fearsome foursome giant Rosey Grier was incredible.  Even Though Rosey towers over Bob, it almost seems as though Bob's presence is just a big.  We need more entertainers and American's like Bob, especially during our current situation.",1164931200,,411,4.913043478260869
