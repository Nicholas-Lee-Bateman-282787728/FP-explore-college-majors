8127302,2,B000FVQWCY,Strange. I am surprised Connors allowed his name on this. A preview of the video would have helped me make a better decision about purchase.,1405728000,,140,4.64

8127304,5,B000FVQWCY,"I really enjoyed  viewing the film---It talked a lot about philosophy of playing tennis..If I get the jobe, This one of the films I will show to class---after the second or third week of class! I rate the film as a five star",1373846400,,224,4.209302325581396
8127305,1,B000FVQWCY,This DVD is a waste of money.  It is simply a few exercises such as jumping rope and a few others.  That is all.  Not worth even one dollar.,1329350400,,140,3.7586206896551726
8127306,4,B000FVQWCY,"This is a very good overview of the sport.  Although it is hosted by Jimmy Connors, there are many different points of view presented at various skill levels.  The instruction covers almost all aspects of the game, however, it leaves you wanting and needing more detail in each area.  If a player, or aspiring player, maintains reasonable expectations, especially given the physical content limits of two DVDs, then buying this package will offer plenty of value at a relatively low price.",1226448000,,489,5.012345679012346
8127307,5,B000FVQWCY,"I bought the whole library - if you want to get the specific teaching, you should look into the individual titles that go with the series.  Comprehensive is an overview of all aspects of tennis and I think is great for players that already have a basic mastery of the game but want to hear and see detail and insights to make their game better.  Its not just drills - there is a lot of talk and instruction with JC, Chrissy, Blake, Justine, the Bryan Bros, and Tracy Austin.  If you are looking for the basic instructional DVD, this is not it.  You can look into one of the other titles in the series for specific skills sets, drills, etc.  This DVD is a combination of philosophy, instructions, personal stories, and drills - there is plenty to learn here and its entertaining to watch.",1155945600,7,787,4.4375
8127308,1,B000FVQWCY,"I am a big fan of Jimmy Connors, but I can't recommend this DVD. Most of the content is simply video of group lessons where a class of teenage students go through various drills. This is the kind of thing you can watch at your local tennis facility for free. There is little discussion of technique and in fact there is little discussion at all. There are a few chapters where Jimmy and one of his guest stars discuss an aspect of the game, but these are very light in content and really don't justify the purchase.",1154131200,18,515,4.319587628865979
