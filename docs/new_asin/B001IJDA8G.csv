8311025,5,B001IJDA8G,"IF you are a Sandro nena, or in other words a huge fan, of this mega-star from Argentina of the 1960s, 70s and 80s you will love this early work. Yes, it has a corny plot: tortured artist with an older rich woman as a mentor conflicting with his young shop-girl love interest and thrown in for good measure is the obligatory funny male friend side-kick.  This movie is not about the story, it is about the early years of Sandro de America. It is set in Buenos Aires, Argentina and surrounding area which is delightful.
This will only appeal to a limited niche, those infected with Sandro-mania.  If you are similarly afflicted, te va a gustar muchisimo!",1279929600,6,653,4.52542372881356
