2837997,5,B000QGCOJ8,"Thrills! Spills! Chills! Comedy! Action! Romance! Drama! Things blowing up real good!  ""Hannibal Brooks"" has it all.  Oliver Reed in the title role is one the coolest macho guys of all time.  Puckish Michael J. Pollard is a classic character actor in the strictest
 sense of the term.  The central premise would crumble if you didn't believe in the relationship between Reed and Lucy the Elephant.  I've seen less on screen chemistry between humans than Reed and Lucy's.  This is the ""Citizen Kane"" for movies of this kind.  Ummm....there is no other movie of this kind.  No matter it's terrific.",1328227200,2,596,4.88
2837998,5,B000QGCOJ8,"At last, this wonderful movie is finally available on DVD. Made by Michael Winner in 1968 in the days when he was making films for the family that didn't involve women being raped and tortured. The story of a British P.O.W. in 1944 helping to lead an elephant over the Alps to freedom in Switzerland was devised by Winner and former P.O.W. Tom Wright and blessed by a great script full of quotable lines by ""Likely Lads"" writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Oliver Reed (and the rest of the cast) are great, although the film is stolen by Michael J. Pollard, who has never been better than he is in this film. With great picture postcard photography of Austria (by Robert Paynter) and a terrific score by ""Love Story"" composer Francis Lai, this is great entertainment and deserves to be better known than it is.

This DVD is on the DVD-R format which thankfully means that it is Region Free (I can confirm this having played it on a Region 2 DVD player). It is a clean print (apart from a few speckles in the closing moments) and in Widescreen (1:1.66). One minor quibble is that when the German characters speak in German, there are no subtitles (the version I previously recorded from BBC 2 does have these subtitles although they are not vital as the German is often translated by some of the other characters). Still it is enough that this film is finally available on DVD and not in the slightly cut version previously shown on BBC2 (the scene in the barn featuring the amorous lovers is shown in full here, although it is nothing to frighten the horses about - this is a family film after all). Fantastic!!!!",1325203200,15,1618,4.522184300341297
2837999,4,B000QGCOJ8,"Before British director Michael Winner made his world-famous or
infamous Charles Bronson revenge thriller ""Death Wish,"" he made a most
unusual World War II movie. Imagine a British P.O.W., played by Oliver
Reed, escaping to Switzerland with an Indian elephant that he has been
ordered to evacuate from a German zoo and you've got the basic plot of
""Hannibal Brooks."" In his autobiography ""Winner Take All,"" Winner
remembers that Aida, the elephant, had to be accompanied by another
elephant, each of them tipping the scales at two and half tons! Between
the elephant, the rowdy Reed, and drug-addled Michael J. Pollard,
Winner wound up helming the usual firefights between the Germans and
the escaped prisoners-of-war that make up this slightly overlong war
movie. Winner stages a convoy ambush, a train derailment, avalanches of
logs and stones, and ultimately the destruction of a massive border
guard post with verve. Although it doesn't qualify as a really big
World War II epic like director J. Lee Thompson's ""The Guns of
Navarone"" or Brian G. Hutton's ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""Hannibal Brooks""
is still above-average because it is so unlike all other World War II
movies.

Patriotism doesn't clap its heels together and storm to the front of
the action. Indeed, James Donald of ""The Great Escape"" where he
portrayed the Allied P.O.W. Commandant has the only role in ""Hannibal
Brooks"" that vocalizes patriotism. Meanwhile, the Germans--especially
the S.S.--aren't demonized. Appropriately enough, Winner relied on
Pollard--fresh from his Oscar nominated role in ""Bonnie & Clyde""--to
serve as comic relief, and Pollard easily steals the show from Reed and
his gigantic co-star. French composer Francis Lai furnishes a majestic
orchestral score that sounds like something the 101 Strings would have
no problem immortalizing. Nevertheless, like the pachyderm, ""Hannibal
Brooks"" amounts to a slow-moving melodrama which makes it easy to pause
it and walk off for a while to attend to other necessities. There is no
burning urgency, but the film dutifully arrives at its grand finale.

The Germans captured Stephen 'Hannibal' Brooks (Oliver Reed of ""The
Three Musketeers"") in the beginning after he has repaired a vehicle and
they shoot it the tires out, taking him prisoner. Cue the Francis Lai
music and lenser Robert Paynter, who worked with Winner on most of his
pictures, regales us with scenic long shots of Germany as a period
train trundles through it. During the train ride, British enlisted man
Brooks meets American enlisted man Packy (Michael J. Pollard of ""Bonnie
& Clyde"") and persuades him to serve as their look-out while they try
to loosen some planks in the ceiling of a train. The escape attempt is
short-lived, but for the remainder of this 101-minute actioneer, Packy
and Brooks cross paths at the best and worst times. Once they have been
settled into Stalag 7-A, our heroes learn that the Germans are looking
for men to work for them in the nearby town of Munich. The vicar (James
Donald of ""The Great Escape"") suggests they pass up this opportunity
because they are still on the British Army payroll, but Brooks takes
the Germans up on their offer and finds himself tending an elephant
named Lucy (Aida in her only starring role) when he isn't in camp.

Packy manages to escape when the Allies drop bombs on the zoo. Brooks
refuses to abandon Lucy. A piece of shapnel lodges in her side, but our
hero nurses her back to health. The bombing killed the German elephant
so Lucy is entrusted entirely to Brooks. Indeed, the zoo curator
arranges for Brooks--under guard of course--to take Lucy to Innsbruck and
so the journey of hardship begins for both man and beast. Kurt, the
German soldier (Peter Carsten of ""Dark of the Sun"") who supervises
their trip, rubs Brooks raw and neither man has respect for the other.
Eventually, Brooks can longer abide Kurt, and they tangle in the middle
of the woods when Kurt makes a foolish move to shoot Lucy. The second
time that they trade blows, Kurt falls down a hillside and the woman,
Vronia (Karin Baal of ""Dead Eyes of London""), who accompanies them
discovers that he is dead. Brooks decides to make a dash for
Switzerland. Vronia and a sympathetic German guard, Willy (Teutonic
actor Helmut Lohner), go their different ways. The closest character to
being a villain--other than the drunken Kurt--is German Colonel von
Haller. One of the most recognized German character actors to play
officers in World War II movies for 30 years--Wolfgang Priess--is
instantly credible and twice as villainous. Initially, he forces Lucy,
Brooks, and Kurt vacate a train freight car that was assigned to
accommdate them during their trip to a quiet part of Germany that
Allied bombers wouldn't devastate. Later, when they are crossing a
narrow bridge, our heroes encounter the unsavory von Haller again. This
time Brooks doesn't capitulate to von Haller. He explains to the
colonel while Kurt stands by impotently that you cannot turn an
elephant around on a narrow bridge and that Lucy cannot walk backwards.

""Hannibal Brooks"" won't top anybody's list of memorable World War II
movies. This is war as an adventure with few opportunities to cast
combat in an unglamorous look. Nevertheless, Winner does make war seem
ironic. After they knock over an eight truck German convoy, Packy
discovers the Jerries were carrying cans of bully beef. This color
picture is still entertaining and most of all different compared to
most combat movies. Winner recounts in his autobiography that he
collaborated on the script treatment of ""Hannibal Brooks"" with a
Norwich house painter who tended an elephant in Munich during the war.",1261008000,2,5666,5.037313432835821
2838000,4,B000QGCOJ8,"One of Oliver Reed's lesser known movies. Too bad there isn't a North American release in Widescreen, but this version is still good. Just remember to turn off the Japanese subtitles.
There's some good action and some excellent humour courtesy of Michael J Pollard, an escaped American POW leading a band of POW's and insurgents against the German military machine.
It's a great story and well performed, and something out of the ordinary for a War movie. Oliver Reed was great in anything he did and this is no exception. The only criticism is the soundtrack is a bit overwhelming at times and the cuts between scenes a bit amateurish. The special effects are are OK by today's standard, but would have been right on course for 1969. Still, the movie translates well to today, mainly because of the unique story and the ""fish-out-of-water"" characters played by Reed & Pollard.
I recommend picking this movie up, anywhere you can. Copies are out there. For the price you won't be disappointed, and it may even become a favorite.",1202601600,9,1028,4.813559322033898

2838003,5,B000QGCOJ8,"I've renewed my interest in the late Oliver Reed's works and was delighted by this movie on Amazon Instant Video.  Reed doesn't portray his usual menacing, brooding character.  Instead he plays an amiable, competent British officer who finds himself working at the Munich Zoo as a POW.  He is put in charge of Lucy the elephant and soon develops a friendship with her.  The scenes where Reed talks to her, tugs her ear, and plays ball with her will warm your soul.  They are marvelous together.  After the Americans bomb the zoo (hard to watch), Reed must accompany Lucy to safety at the Innsbruck zoo.  Their trials and tribulations on this journey make a good movie.  Something different.

2838006,2,B000QGCOJ8,"Even though this wartime adventure is more lighthearted and whimsical than Michael Winner's more famous efforts (Death Wish), his characteristic lack of subtlety diminishes the charm and earnestness Oliver Reed brings to the title role.  Yes, that's right.  Oliver Reed is both charming and earnest playing opposite his trained elephant leading lady.  Too bad about Winner's ham-fisted direction.  Also, co-star Michael J. Pollard overdoes his patented dumpliing-faced quirkiness.  Worth seeing as a curio though",1361836800,,512,5.864864864864865

2838008,5,B000QGCOJ8,"This is the one for you. Actually, there might be a handful of others, but once you take away The Three and Four Musketeers movies that number is VERY low. I love Oliver Reed, I think he was an excellent actor, and an amazing man (alcohol induced alter ego aside).
This movie is strange.

It starts out as a war movie. Oliver Reed plays ""Brooks"" a soldier who at the start of the movie is captured and taken prisoner by the Germans. He winds up working at a zoo in Munich, taking responsibility of an elephant. His assorted company, aside from the elephant, include two German soldiers, a girl, and an American POW with a goofy grin, a reedy, unassuming voice, and a pronounced case of pyromania. The zoo is bombed, the head caretaker of the elephant killed, and the zoo director decides to move Lucy the elephant, with Brooks, the two German soldiers, and the girl accompanying her. The train is taken over by a German colonel and they are forced to walk the journey.

That's the plot. Things get stranger. People get shot. People get caught. The American keeps turning up in very bizarre places, Lucy the elephant takes down a building. It literally ends with ""And they all lived happily ever after.""
It's a good movie, not fantastic, but entertaining, and I have watched it multiple times and enjoy it thoroughly.",1352592000,,1316,4.619658119658119
2838009,5,B000QGCOJ8,"This is mostly Winner's last European love letter style film before becoming an ex pat Hollywood director. It is transitional in that sense as it features many intense action sequences and situations not seen in his earlier London/UK centric work yet the love of scenery is still apparent. The action work would be played up in his later film like Death Wish. STUNNING SHOTS OF THE ALPS!  Great acting, Francis Lai score and of course the elephant is WONDERFUL without being sentimental. another unsung gem of cinema by Winner and Reed. GET THIS FILM!",1334793600,5,551,4.861702127659575
2838010,2,B000QGCOJ8,"[""Hannibal Brooks"" - (1968) - Directed by Michael Winner - 102 min. approx.] As a fan of Oliver Reed, Michael J. Pollard, 60's war flicks and 4-legged mammals, I read the two reviews prior to mine and scarfed this one up greedily. It had all the earmarks of a great film, but fell flat every chance it was offered. It wasn't terrible - mildly entertaining if one's expectations are kept extremely low, or if a night of mindless family-friendly viewing is in mind - but it is disappointing, on several levels in fact.

There's not much of a set-up, story-wise. Within the first five minutes, British soldier Brooks (Reed) is captured and whisked off to a German POW camp and assigned as caregiver to a Munich zoo Elephant named Lucy. They bond immediately (highly unlikely) and, moments later, are shipped off to the north and safer digs for Lucy (also highly unlikely) after an air raid almost destroys the zoo. When an SS officer commandeers the train car designated for the pachyderm, Brooks, Lucy, a very sympathetic German soldier and a stereotypical evil Nazi are sent along as guards/guides as they hit the yellow-brick road through breathtakingly beautiful Austria on an incredibly unlikely and implausable journey. Oh yeah, there's even a 'Dorothy' character (Karin Baal) sent along as a cook/concubine for the nazi, who gets drunk every night and falls all over while spewing German commands, which should have been subtitled so we'd have something more to do while watching. That's pretty much it. Except for Pollard's character, a clich&eacute;d 60's anarchist American escapee weasel who weaves in and out throughout the film when things get dull (which means he's under-utilized dramatically) to blow something up or rescue Brooks, his tin man, cowardly lion and sweet Dorothy (also extremely unlikely).

I'm sorry, but the story was very trite and the characters undeveloped if not downright cartoonish, and the entire premise preposterous even within the realm of Walt Disney. To add insult to injury (and I DO mean insult), the ending actually suffers from the tag-line, in huge letters spread across the screen, ""And they all lived happily ever after""!! No joke. The End. (I wish I was kidding, but this is a paralyzing, painful truth).

Oliver Reed does what he can with the post-it-sized script he's been given by director, writer and producer Michael Winner, all things considered, but the elephant, Lucy, steals the show, along with the picturesque Austrian scenery. Otherwise, this one's an embarrassment to all participants (except Pollard, whose roles were always limited by his outward appearance) and it's no wonder this one tanked at the box office upon release.

My wife had a great idea after we watched it (seeing as the opportunity to not watch it had already slipped away) - that Reed and Pollard's characters should have been switched, giving Pollard more deserved comedic time as the elephant's custodian, and letting Reed do what would later become something he's more remembered and celebrated for, namely fighting and destroying things in a boisterous rage. Oh well...",1330992000,7,3105,5.070450097847358

8196130,2,B000QGCOJ8,"Hannibal Brooks is an offbeat 60's WW11 flick that gets too far fetched for its own good.  It starts with the improbable premise of a British P.O.W., played by the unique Oliver Reed,  who is forced to walk an elephant cross country from Germany to Austria, accompanied by two guards and a beautiful Polish woman.  The film alternates between idyllic poses in front of some dramatic Alpine scenery, and some rather violent action involving a band of partisans who seem to be on every path that Reed takes, ambushing German patrols and blowing up train tracks.  The said action provides most of the dynamism for what otherwise would be a rather sluggish road movie.  There are some implausible plot twists, to say the least.  Reed is generally good, and it is always a pleasure to see him, but you will have difficulty deciding whether low-key Michael J. Pollard, as the partisan leader, is effective or not.  The movie can't decide what it wants to be, and should be ultimately viewed as a campy misfire from the 60's.",1418169600,2,1018,4.7175141242937855
