If you like like straight up WTF films then this has it. This films tries to view things from a particular part of the brain and thus ends up being very confusing and off the wall.",1461369600,,340,4.08955223880597

8183854,1,B000O76TOU,"This is an odd tale I had difficulty comprehending. It appears to be a critique of the teachings of  Amida Buddha who claim man is higher than animals. The film presents men as no better than animals and appears to mock the theology/philosophy of the teachings by utilizing a pig farm/slaughter house. Humans are reduced to primitive roles involving rape, killing, incest, and voyeurism. Unfortunately it was done in such a haphazard matter there was no real plot to follow.

For a special viewer, which didn't include me.

8183855,1,B000O76TOU,"Ok, maybe I just don't get it.... Seriously though, this movie was like watching a freak show of braying jackasses and rediculous fake blood. This movie obviously was meant to be random and weird, I just wasn't able to even finish this movie. I want a refund and an apology from the writer of this movie for wasting a half hour of my life watching this crap.",1360886400,2,358,4.358208955223881
8183856,5,B000O76TOU,"Ah yes. ID, the super ego. ID is directed by Kei Fujiwara who stared in Tetsuo. The film definetly had an effect on her or atleast expressed her intrest in the strange, artistic, and macarbe which comes out in this film. It plays like a dream. Things don't always make sense. The story revolves around a rural small town, but more focused on a group of pig famers/slaughterers. each charcter has quirk in some way, all of them misfits. The film itself realies less on plot and more on emotion and imagery. the result is strange and beautiful. thers tinges of black humor that makes you feel uncomfortable also. all in all, for the price its a definte pick up. but if you're looking for Ju-On or Ringu you'd best avoid it. definetly for the artistic and open minded.",1308700800,7,765,4.510791366906475

  As far as a plot or storyline of this movie is concerned there really isn't much to tell, and reading the blurb on the back of dvd case won't do too much to help the viewer dicipher what exactly it is that they're watching or give many clues as to what exactly is going on. Each sceen seems to exist simply to open the door for more violence, more extremism, and more confusion. Perhaps the last ten minutes or so show a real attempt to convey an idea or reason for all the scenes that preceeded it but honestly i don't love the movie for the message or it's attempt to tie everything together, i love it for it's bizaare randomness and incoherent progression of cracked out images.

Seeing as to how difficult it is to explain this movie i thought i would compare it to some other cracked out films i enjoy. video quality is somewhere between Gozu and Meatbsll Machine- like Kichiku, but not as well shot. Believe me though, this only adds to the film. The story is more random than Gozu or Crazylips and is in fact, so random that it makes Gummo come across as a very linear story. Think Izo, but without the repeditive theme. It's definetly a low budget flick but like i said earlier, this only adds to the overall feeling of the film and doesn't detract from the story like Meatball Machine does (hated it) - if it had better more realistic effects i don't know that the film would have been any better and quite honestly, it probably would have failed where this one succeeds.

Bottom line, i can't rememeber the last time i said WTF so many times in such a short time span. Definetly not for some, but gold for ""crack heads"" like myself. Highly recommended",1216771200,14,1883,4.338068181818182
