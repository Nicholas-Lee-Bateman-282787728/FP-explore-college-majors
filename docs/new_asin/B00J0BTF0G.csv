8646978,4,B00J0BTF0G,"This is a good little series.  For the uninitiated these six events are brought to life and the entirety of the missions are covered clearly and cleverly.

I would highly recommend this series to those that are interested in military events of the last 30 years (although five of the six missions covered are post 9-11).

As someone who has read about everyone of these missions, these DVDs are quick and efficient overviews of the Black Ops contained within this series.

I sincerely hope that season two is released on DVD!",1424563200,,525,4.736263736263736
