I find each episode either adventurous, heart-warming, dealing with human nature or issues with our country or other countries that really do make us think.

2465878,4,B000CMNJPE,I rewatched the 2-part season opener about the search for Ambrose's Holy Rose and the associated collection of artifacts. The opening rescue sequence was great.  The concept of the peaceful matriarchal peoples whose artifacts Ambrose collected is based on theories which no longer hold a great deal of acceptance.  The creation of a laser by a medieval scholar is a nice twist.,1447891200,,377,5.064516129032258

This show is a great for today as much as then. Good entertainment for kids as well as adults which is hard to find. Minimal violance and looking for a non leathal way out are Macgyvers goals in all the predicaments he finds himself in. I greatly enjoy how he demonstraits that there is always a solution to the problem if your willing to take a moment and figure it out.
Although some of the solutions are a little convienient, it is still a great way for kids to learn good qualities.
Highly recomended clean entertainment.",1442361600,,614,4.442477876106195

Prime emails me a few days later to ask me to rate what I watched, which I usually don't even remember turning on due to booze and the late hour.

I just got an email asking me to rate ""Macgyver, Season 5""
No recollection of this.

Why season 5?
And how many seasons are there?

This is like self-induced ""Memento."" I have so many questions.

The reality shows teach low morals that we wonder why the children today make such poor decisions. MacGyver taught you to use your mind, to be resourceful, to work toward goals like saving the community.  But this season was a little too sappy that was why only 4 stars.

2465971,5,B000CMNJPE,"I have been an admirer of MacGyver since the first show.  A good science student or chemistry student would know how to do all the things that MacGyver does, which is very intriguing.  I like MacGyver mostly because he is everything I am not as far as the talents he possesses.  I would recommend MacGyver to any adventurous person, science or chemistry-talented person.  Watching MacGyver also  prompted me to purchase two different swiss army knives, one with an altimeter and compass and flashlight.",1386979200,,502,5.0

I bought the whole series for my nieces & nephews to watch when they are over to my house.  I remember this series really got me interested in chemestry, physics and logical thinking.  Even though the scenarious seemed far fetched it was fun trying to prove it wrong (or right).  Sometimes entertainment - can just be entertainment and not have to prove something.  So pop a bowl of popcorn and fire up the DVD with some old fashioned TV programming and enjoy the family times.",1305504000,,604,4.598130841121495

2466006,5,B000CMNJPE,"I have been ordering the MacGyver DVD's ""piecemeal"" rather than in the complete set, partly because I'd acquired the ""First Season"" from another source, but could not find the subsequent sets in retail outlets, and partly because I had not got into the ""rhythm"" of watching the DVD's until recently.  However, once started, I've felt compelled to finish, so I am now in the midst of the fifth season and have received the final two sets.  I will review them as I view them.

The fifth season is intriguing in many ways.  It deals, as all the MacGyver stories do, with issues of various sorts -- especially social and ecological problems -- that were current at the time of the original filming.  I am amazed in retrospect at how extremely timely they actually remain.  However, there are some delightful and intriguing plot twists, and I would rate the ""Christmas Episode"" of the fifth season, ""The Madonna"", as one of the all-time best stories I've ever viewed.",1230508800,3,962,4.765060240963855
2466007,4,B000CMNJPE,"I ordered the final season to catch up on the best serious of it's time. MacGyver gets you involved and always fascinating to see how he gets out of trouble. I enjoyed viewing the serious all over again and welcome anyone new to watching MacGyver to get a copy, still very up to date.",1222041600,,284,4.277777777777778
2466008,5,B000CMNJPE,I now have all 7 seasons of MacGyver.  They are well written and well acted. It has action & some comedy. 2 thumbs up from me!,1216339200,,126,3.8461538461538463

2466010,4,B000CMNJPE,I agree with the last reviewer because I definitely think the best epsisodes were in season 1-3. Right now I am just getting to season 6 and I am realizing that the shows are becomming somewhat boring and totally different then the first few seasons of Macgyver. I am thinking that Seasons 4-7 are not as good as the rest of the seasons but I will have to wait and see when I finish my collection. I am also noticing Jack Dalton and Penny Parker don't have many appearances either in season 5 and it feels a little lonely without them.,1171152000,3,535,4.306930693069307
2466011,2,B000CMNJPE,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but apart from ""legend of the holy rose parts 1 and 2"", and ""halloween knights"" (a murdoc episode), the others I really found rather boring. far too much preachy talkie guf, and not enough MacGyverisms and action.

Season 6 picks up again a bit, but beware, by this time the writers really were running short of good storylines, and the show was past it's best.

Season's 1 and 2 were fantastic, 3 and 4 were still very good, but 5 is the weakest in the set, with 6 being mediocre, and 7 little better.

Overall I would give Season 5 a 4/10",1169856000,3,573,4.287037037037037
