8653705,5,B00JS8CV5M,"Although I know the director of this beautiful film, that did not affect my opinion...or if it did I came prepared to think about this film as being ""less than"" a great Hollywood picture. I was very impressed with how well done this film is. Clearly a labor of love for director Cynthia Hsiung. Although Cynthia is well known for her work at VH1 and on Young Hercules,  this was her first film that she alone produced and directed. It flows extremely well, with beautiful scenery, music and cinematography. The actors are all impressive...not a wooden one in the bunch. This film is as good as many films who make it to the national awards ceremonies. I could watch it again, and even my husband liked it. It's nice to see this film gathering more and more accolades.",1398038400,,767,4.557971014492754

8653707,5,B00JS8CV5M,"What a long journey it is to make a movie! This film took thousands of hours of hard work and dedication. The film is based on a true story about two people who thought their relationship was only about unattached sex. Years later, life's circumstances brought them back together for one fateful night. Suddenly, it was as though the universe was pushing them to look deeper into themselves: ""It's like a dog whistle, where only your soulmate can hear the call.""

This was a low budget film with a big budget heart. I hope you might enjoy my film, the wonderful actors, actresses, and all the talent that went into it. So many people put their hearts and souls into this film. I'm very proud that we won 5 awards. No movie is ever for everyone so I don't expect everyone to like it. However, for those who do, I made this film for you!

Thank you.
