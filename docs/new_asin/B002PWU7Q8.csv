It helps in working through the pain and then finding ways to open your life to new blessings and relationships.  I could really relate to all Stacy said.  When I watched the first session, I cried.  It was good for me, I needed to.  One thing that impressed me was that Stacy speaks not only from his heart and experience, but also with a lot of practical insight.  I wish I had had this seminar when my dad died a number of years ago.  I would highly recommend it.",1254355200,,545,4.1826923076923075
