8475714,3,B005JGVY8C,"I was going to give this two stars, but decided on three because everything that is supposed to be on the CD is there and the price was OK.

Why did I consider two stars?

First the recording are from different sources.  Some are from original BBC broadcasts, some are from rebroadcasts in the U.S.  All together there is a huge difference in audio quality among the shows.

Second,  it appears that seller is using CD-RWs, because I could clearly hear in the background several Fred Allen Shows during at least two episodes.  I am guessing that the Paul Temple episodes where burned to a CD which originally had Fred Allen shows on it.  Even if that is not the case, I still had to filter out mentally the Fred Allen audio to follow  the Paul Temple audio.",1397433600,,757,4.427536231884058
