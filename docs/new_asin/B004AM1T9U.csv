just another way to mock n rip off all the fans, cleverly disguising the same thing under new titles & different cover art.

DON'T BUY THIS IF YOUR A REAL T.REX FAN AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY SEEN IT ALL ...
AND MORE OVER PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE THIS EXACT SAME PRODUCT
WITH ABOUT 3 DIFFERENT COVERS & TITLES !!!

not a good deal at all & no fault of the seller, but the companies who keep rehashing & trying to scam us !!!
ALL I CAN SAY IS BUYER BEWARE ... YOU'VE SEEN ALL THIS FOOTAGE A MILLION TIMES BEFORE !!!",1381795200,,614,4.151260504201681
