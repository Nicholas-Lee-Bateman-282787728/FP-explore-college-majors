809874,5,6304162200,I love the Flinstone! and think that I will always share this with my children. Anyone who grew up watching the Flinstones will cherish this movie.,1196380800,,147,4.6923076923076925
809875,5,6304162200,A Flintstone Christmas Carol is a very nice Christmas movie. If you are a fan of the Flintstones or if your not you will still really enjoy this movie.,1193788800,,151,4.241379310344827
809876,4,6304162200,"The Bedrock gang give their version of the Dickens classic.  Fred lands the role of Scrooge in the Bedrock Community Theatre version of the play.  Fred throws himself into the role as Scrooge and soon starts having delusions of granduer as he thinks he's on his way to broadway...or Broadrock or something.  Anyway Fred starts treating everyone poorly, forgets to do his shopping and to pickup Pebbles.  He's only thinking about his rehearsal for his role.

The play goes on with everyone upset at Fred but he, like Scrooge, eventually learns the error of his ways at the end, and gains the true Christmas spirit.  This is about what you'd expect from a Hanna Barbera production in terms of animation.  While it doesn't have the adult-oriented humor of the 1960's show it's still pretty good in general and worth at least one viewing.",1127865600,,834,4.79020979020979
809877,5,6304162200,"""A Flintstone's Christmas Carol"" is a great remake of the classic novel ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, including that it is Christmas in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone who plays Ebonezer Scrooge, Wilma makes his clothes, Barney Rubble is his stooge, Bamm-Bamm is Tiny Tim, in Bedrock's X-mas play, not so far, and I give this remake of Dicken's classic 5 stars.",1026777600,,364,4.983606557377049
809878,4,6304162200,"I have this on video and I really enjoy watching it.  I think the Flintstone's version of Dicken's classic is really interesting.  The ""Bedrock Bug"" concept is funny too.  This is highly recommended.  Oh, I also liked the line by Philo, the cop:  ""You'd better get the stars out of your eyes and watch where you're going.""",1014249600,11,322,4.578947368421052
809879,5,6304162200,"Now, I have seen Muppets playing characters of A Chrismas Carol. And now this. As A Flintstone Christmas Carol opens, Fred Flintstone has been practing his part for the play. And he is going to be Scrooge. But when somebody gets the Bedrock Bug a diease that only lasts 24 hours, his wife takes his/her place. And that she aslo replaces two women in the play when they come up with the Bedrock Bug. Wilma who works behind the senes as to go to the threater early, needs her hushband to pick up Pebbles Flintstone at day care. But he doesn't listen. And instead remembers after work that he doesn't have presents to put under the tree for Wilma and Pebbles. So he goes shooping at the last minute. But shows up at the threater without Pebbles. And his wife is mad with him. But Barney picked Pebbles up at day care when he comes for Bamn Bamn. Watch this tape!",1007942400,2,859,4.341614906832298
809880,3,6304162200,"Well, I can't say this is the best version I have seen, and I am not sure Charles Dickens would be overly impressed with this. And, I would sooner use the ""Muppets' Christmas Carol"" to help someone understand the story. But aside from that, the movie is quite clever. Despite the unorthodox acting of the Flintstones, the Rubbles, Mr. Slate, Dino, and others, the story is told fairly well. What I found quite entertaining was that this is the first version of ""A Christmas Carol"" I have seen where backstage squabbles make up a fair portion of the movie. And in all honesty, there is something very funny about seeing the actors perform in at least partial harmony on stage, and then seeing them argue backstage between the scenes. And the part of the story which involves Fred getting too much into character is actually quite realistic. While this is not the best version of Dickens' classic, and while I would not use it to teach someone the story, it is a delightful movie to watch after you have a healthy understanding of the story.",973814400,17,1039,4.621621621621622
809881,5,6304162200,"When I was a child I loved the Flintstones.  So, I bought this video thinking that the kids might like the Flintstones too!  I was surprised - I  loved the video - even more than they did.!  Fred is his usual grumpy,  wonderful self - and a natural to play Scrooge. Barney, Wilma and the rest  of the gang round out the cast.  Thestory within a story is a clever way to  stage a Christmas Carol.  Great fun for the whole family (especially the  Baby Boomers!",966902400,6,458,4.22093023255814

810062,2,6304162200,"It's OK for kids - bust for them to be putting on a ""play"" it really stretches the imagination to the point of breaking. I know one shouldn't overthink a cartoon - but becoming semi-transparent and flying from house to house as part of a stage production is too unrealistic for me, as are ""feathers"" that turn into real snow on ""stage"".

If you can overlook it or have small kids - enjoy it.",1450828800,,391,4.283783783783784
810063,1,6304162200,"My one star is meant to indicate my dissenting vote. Everyone else here may have loved this but I didn't. Why? This is yet another classic cartoon character to later be marred by a snarky tone. The plot synopsis says that Fred, who has the role of Scrooge in a play of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"", turns into one. But this happens because Fred gets a big head, not due to any malevolence on his part. Wilma, however, completely out of character, does turn into a Scrooge. Both of these subplots way overshadow the actual performance of the play. The Director let her snarky tone ruin that entirely. So I would not recommend watching this at all. A much better animated Dickens version is ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"". However, the included episode on this disc, from the Flintstones entitled ""A Christmas Flintstone"" is well worth watching. This disc is also included in the 4 Kids Favorites Holiday Family Fun Collection DVD pack which includes 'Yogi Bear's All Star Christmas Caper"" which is an excellent holiday feature with a cast of lots of popular H-B characters,, along with Two Rankin-Bass specials, ""Jack Frost"" and ""A Miser Brothers' Christmas"". There have been a great many very good Hanna-Barbera specials that are well worth watching. What's the difference? This special dates from the '90s, a time when many classic characters were being ruined by studios which viewed them simply as ""properties"" and allowed people to write for, animate, and direct them who had no sense of the characters. Look what happened to Garfield. this contrasts mightily to the heyday of Hanna-Barbera and such earlier specials as the excellent ""A Jetson Christmas Carol"".",1449792000,2,1662,4.982014388489208

810246,5,6304162200,"Like the Mr. Magoo version of Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol, this is a framed story - a story in another story.  Fred Flintstone is a ""real life"" Scrooge, who thinks only of himself, crowding in line, forgetting to buy anyone else presents, speeding on the streets of Bedrock, etcetera.  He even forgets to pick up his own daughter, Pebbles, after work!

Fred also plays the role of Scrooge in a theatrical version of A Christmas Carol, so the moral of the stories really hit home with a double whammy!",1391904000,,516,4.648351648351649

810251,5,6304162200,"One of the most filmed stories ever is A Christmas Carol.  Many ensembles have put the tale to film in memorable ways.  I just saw this for the first time and now consider it one of my favorite versions, with Mickey's Christmas Carol, An American Christmas Carol, and Scrooge starring Alastair Sim.  The story, being adapted and performed so very often, is at risk of becoming trite.  Like pieces of music, Shakespeare plays, and Biblical dramas, A Christmas Carol runs the risk of being performed so much its very story will no longer feel fresh.  Thus it was a very pleasant surprise to me when the Flintstones version had just the right amount of unusual touches to make it fun in its own right, rather than just as another rendition of a classic story.  One of the things that is most fun about it is that Bedrock puts on a stage production, and Fred, full of himself because he's the star performer, assigned the part of Scrooge, antagonizes everyone around him because he's so selfish.  (He is the only character I've seen on entertainment whom I can call ""likably selfish""!)  During the performance, he undergoes the change from selfishness to caring about others that the Scrooge character he's playing undergoes.  There are additional plot elements which jeopardize the stage production, including Fred forgetting important tasks before the production and different cast members having to be replaced because of illness.  I enjoy how these little variations add originality and freshness, and that the story is a stage play Bedrock puts on instead of Fred actually being Scrooge.  As always, the visual creativity of Bedrock's ""stone age"" life, the dinosaurs and birds doing all kinds of silly tasks, etc., is appealing.  And I like the tone/flavor of this version also because there is a special sweetness which doesn't feel so serious like most versions feel.  It feels kind of silly and kind of sweet, and more lighthearted than the actual Christmas Carol story, because of the funny context:  a stage play that has a lot of common and believable behind-the-scenes problems (illness, forgetfulness, ego problems).  (By the way, isn't it kind of funny that Wilma never has any expression on her eyes except a black round dot, just points her eyebrows to show she's upset?  That's her mood most of this movie because Fred is so obsessed with his role that he's neglectful of her and Pebbles!  And what's with them never wearing socks or shoes in the snow?  And the stone tablet with the script breaks just from tossing it!  Must be really weak stone!)  Fun casting fact:  John Rhys-Davies, whose most famous roles are probably Sallah on Indiana Jones and Gimli and Treebeard on The Lord of the Rings, is the stage play's narrator.",1390348800,,2740,4.862068965517241

810360,4,6304162200,"Since it's the holiday season, I've been trying to find as many animated shows that have a Christmas-theme for my first grader's viewing enjoyment. She loves cartoons and other animated shows, and we have many of the classics such as Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, and many more.

Our recent purchases include The Chipmunks' Christmas (quite entertaining, and fun, and a must watch for fans of the Chipmunks and their singing), and A Flintstones Christmas Carol. Bedrock is putting on an adaptation of A Christmas Carol, and Fred Flintstone is playing the part of Scrooge. Unfortunately, he gets too caught up in his role that he forgets to buy presents for his family and friends, and only has a day left until Christmas!

The story puts an interesting spin on the classic tale with Fred and other cast members squabbling over their roles and at the same time, focuses on how Fred is taught the true meaning of the holiday season via his family and friends. There's a also a bonus episode ""Christmas Flintstone"". The language and subtitle options are English and Portuguese, with a total running time of 69 minutes.

810368,5,6304162200,"There are so many films and animated shorts that can be seen during this time of year. Miracle on 34th Street, Home Alone, The Snowman, Scrooged, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation are just a few examples. Yes, basically anyone can enjoy at least one of these Christmas films, and those who love The Flintstones would love this one. A Flintstones Christmas Carol is more of a play-within-a-movie. Fred is set to play Ebenezer Scrooge for the Bedrock Community Theatre's production of ""A Christmas Carol."" He becomes fully committed in rehearsing the play, so much that he starts to isolate himself from those who are close to him, especially Wilma and Barney. And if you think that's terrible, Fred even forgets to buy presents for his loved ones. Now THAT'S painful! Don't think that this special has a very depressing ending, because during the performance of the play . . . well, I won't really spoil it for you. I will tell you, though, that while this isn't really one of the greatest, it certainly isn't really bad, either. The script does get kind of clever sometimes, and the jokes are quite funny. But most of all, it reminds you of what the holidays are all about: love, friendship, and family. I'd fully recommend it to those who are fans of the Flintstones, and for those who want to add yet another Christmas special to their ""must-watch"" list.",1260921600,,1396,4.7727272727272725
810369,4,6304162200,"This 1994 production (years and years after the original show even left syndication) falls far short of the original series. It's decent, better at some points than others. The actual ""A Christmas Carol"" play portion--Fred plays Scrooge while Wilma is forced to play almost every other character since the original cast members keep falling ill--is better than the scenes leading up to it, but even that doesn't get better than average. It wouldn't be worth messing with on its own.

Now the reason why this gets four stars instead of three is because one extra included is ""Christmas Flintstone,"" which IS an episode in the original series. I had forgotten (or maybe never realized) just how good that show was. The writing is snappy, the timing of the voice actors is spot on and even the animation is fairly good despite the bad rep of Hanna-Barbera. This program is delightful; Fred gets a job working as a department-store Santa, only to end up being asked to take over the duties of the real Claus when he--guess what?--gets sick. On its own, this is a five-star piece.",1260403200,5,1075,4.779569892473118

Although I was already an adult when it debuted, it touches me, makes me laugh, and it just isn't Christmas without it. I used to watch it every year on The Cartoon Network but when it didn't appear in their schedule this Christmas, I was heartbroken. I was so glad to hear it was on DVD and Amazon had it.

  It is a great way to get your children to watch this classic story and it is a good lesson to them about loving and being good to one another. It tells the story in a way they can understand and it is ""watchable"" to adults as well. In fact, I can watch it over and over and never bore with it.",1201478400,,670,4.022556390977444

egocentric and inconsiderate to everyone, while getting ready to star in the Bedrock production of A Christmas Carol. It has some good laughs.",1518134400,,239,5.0
7864855,5,6304162200,"They used to show this movie every year leading up to Christmas but a few years ago, they stopped showing it.  I was disappointed because I love this movie!  Fred Flintstones was chosen to play the role of Scrooge in the Bedrock Community Theater production of ""A Christmas Carol"".  And, well, he's become so obsessed with rehearsing his part, and with the fact that he got the lead role, that he's turning into a real-life Scrooge.  Much to the dismay of Wilma and everyone else.  Wilma is furious when Fred forgets to pick up Pebbles from ""Cave Care"".  To make matters worse, a flu-like illness called ""the Bedrock bug"" has left many people involved in the play-including some of the actors, too sick to perform.  An already stressed out Wilma is left no choice but to fill in for the sick actors. She uses the opportunity to take out her anger on Fred for being such a jerk.  This move is funny and heart-warming.  Fun fact: Wilma is voiced by the original ""Wilma"", Jean Vander Pyl who voiced ""Wilma"" in the 1960s cartoon ""The Flintstones"".  This is one of my favorite quotes from the movie.

Wilma (dressed as the ghost of Christmas Past) is taking Fred (Scrooge) to his past
Fred: Take it easy, Wilma.  We're supposed to be acting.
Wilma: Sorry, Fred.  You're such a convincing Scrooge, I forgot.",1517097600,,1301,4.604347826086957

7864859,4,6304162200,"1st of all - when a factory puts ANY DVD in one of those Crappy Cheap DVD cases - with the recycle symbol Deleting most of the strength of the case -  I will NOT give it a 5-Star review!! - Period!
As for the DVD/Flintstone's itself - I believe it was made in 1977 - long after Alan Reed (Orig. voice of Fred) and Bea Bernaderet (Org. voice of Betty) had passed on. I'm to lazy to research if Jean Vander Pyl did Wilma's voice in this video. Given all of that - Drawn just like the old Hanna Barberra (sp?) days!! Really a great job all in all.
Attn: The bonus on this DVD is even BETTER than the newer movie you might be buying it for!! Orig. voices/cast and the Coloring is Impeccable!! I'd buy it just for the Old Flintstone's Christmas special!!
Makes me really miss the 60's and being a kid. What a Special era!! Scott M.",1513987200,,826,4.098765432098766
