7811639,5,6301404602,This was a gift for my mom and she loves it. This is just one of two books I bought she for her looming and both were a big hit with her. She positively  is delighted with them.,1427760000,,177,3.6578947368421053
7811640,5,6301404602,This tape helped me a lot when I was first learning to weave.  I also used it as a reference until I became comfortable with the technique.,1392163200,,139,4.148148148148148
7811641,5,6301404602,"The instruction contained in the video, Introduction to Weaving, is clear, moves at a pace which allows one to process and follow  the steps, and includes sharp visuals. Deborah Chandler masterfully teaches while all along explaining why certain procedures must be met or may be optional. This is an introduction but the techniques which are taught can be used in more advanced projects.",1348358400,,387,5.142857142857143
7811642,3,6301404602,"First of all, it is not an Introduction to Weaving, but rather an introduction to the looms available.  If you don't know what kind of looms are out there, than you might be interested in this DVD.  It is an older production.  I was originally going to buy the DVD on Rigid Heddle Looming, but it was suggested to purchase this one first.  I'm sorry I did that.  There are no instructions at all.  If you don't know what kind of loom you want to purchase, then this DVD may help you out.  It's like going to the ""auto show"" of looms.  As I did know what loom I wanted and had purchased it already, I found this DVD of no use to me (and actually she was quite boring), I should have purchased the one I intended to, but after seeing this one, I'm hesitant on doing that since it is the same person.",1298937600,,797,4.096774193548387
7811643,5,6301404602,"This presentation at 82 (the cover says 57 minutes: the paperwork inside says 82 minutes) minutes has paid for its self in the first ten minutes.  All the different types of looms are contrasted. Then different methods using the looms are contrasted. The tools and acquirements that can be used are displayed with samples of their use.

This is a great presentation for those with warped minds. Shows different ways to attach the warp to the loom. It even gets into project planning. Deborah Chandler even talks discretely about loom waste and shrinkage.  She gives actual formulas on what to buy.

7811644,5,6301404602,"This video and the book ""Learning to Weave"" by the same person were all my husband and I needed to get started weaving.  We read the book through and watched the tape.  The tape ""fleshed-out"" things we  weren't sure of from the book, and gave us and idea of what hands-on  experience would be like.  Then we used the book for step-by-step  directions and reference when we got going.  I am a beginner and have  limited knowledge.  But from my perspective, I highly recommend this tape  and book.",960595200,,495,4.5227272727272725
