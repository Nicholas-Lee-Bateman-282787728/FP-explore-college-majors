7909826,5,B00000IC6B,"Slayers. The most odd anime series I have ever seen. But hey, I like odd things, so it's GREAT!  Now to start off, the first episode of this movie volume, Lina and the gang are trying to get into this all girl city to  search for that lengendary Clair bible. But the only way they guys can  enter this city is if they all thrown on dresses. And guess what, the guys  (Gourry, Zelgadis and Xellos-sama) all look way better in the dresses then  the girls do. Strange. But anyway, Zelgadis saves the princess of this city  from a monster, and falls for her. The only problem is, (well not the only  problem, but a big problem) is the princess mother wants the girl to become  a shrine maiden. Zelgadis tells the princess to follow her own heart, and  do what she thinks is right. Well one thing strange situtation follows  another, a Mazoku ice demon shows up, and Zelgadis and Gourry end up  stripping down to their undies (that made my sister extremely  happy....don't ask me why) Then the princess rips off her dress to reveal  *gasp!* that She's a HE! Yep, that's right, the princess's mother disguised  the boy as a girl, for reasons unknown. And as it turns out, all the girls  in the city (minus of course Lina, Amelia, Martina and the Queen) are guys.  That could put a strain on Zel's relationship....  After that comes the  other 2 episodes that start out with Xellos telling everyone about a  complete Clair bible hidden inside a mountain. Lina and her crew travel  there, find out that it's really inside another desert like demension, and  meet a weird old woman named Auntie Aqua. Auntie shows Lina what might  happen if she uses Giga Slave too much (the destruction of the world, yada  yada) and then, the Demon Dragon King Gaarv (that's a mouthful) shows up  with his little buddy Zeigram. Xellos true form is revealed to be that of a  mazoku, and Auntie Aqua turns out to be the remaining parts of the Water  Dragon King. There's a big battle between Lina and Zeigram, Gaarv hacks  apart Xellos (don't worry, he doesn't die) and Martina's ZomaGustav god  actually helps out (sorta.) In the end, the gang finds out that they have  to go to a magic mountain guarded by Dragons to find the original copy of  the Clair Bible. And Martina's heart is broken when she finds out what  Xellos really is. (Oh She'll never love again! What a shame, now all the  cute guys in the world are safe from her stalking!) This is a very groovy  volume of Slayers, and one of my personal favs!",956188800,4,2487,4.467706013363029
