8374839,4,B002N8AQLU,"I have searched for this film on DVD or VHS for years.  I even bought a copy a few years ago, but it was in Italian with NO subtitles.  Finally I found a DVD from Amazon.  Although it is not the most professional It Is the movie, and is very watchable.  Thank you for having it available!!",1278892800,,289,4.017543859649122
