8610979,5,B00EZVZKG4,"I feel so thankful to have found this wonderful DVD! I have been seeing a doctor of Chinese medicine, taking herbs and receiving acupuncture treatments for eight months now for fertility. This yoga practice has enhanced my health in so many ways. Dr. Saraswati explains the benefits of every pose according to Chinese medical doctrine which I find so inspiring. This set has not only helped me physically, but emotionally as well. Dr. Saraswati's words and wisdom bring calm to my mind when I am feeling anxious about my fertility journey. If you are dealing with infertility and want to experience a deep and meaningful yoga practice, this is the gem that will guide you to better health, enhanced fertility and help bring peace to your heart.",1409788800,4,744,4.866141732283465
8610980,5,B00EZVZKG4,"Really glad I got this DVD, it's one of my favourite fertility tools.  I love how it is split into four sections for each part of the cycle and Dr Robin Saraswati Markus gives indepth explanations as to what the poses are achieving in the body which I find motivating.  The addition of a meditation practice is a very relaxing.  It is well-presented with some interesting poses and makes me feel great - as if the flow is reaching all the right places!  I definitely recommend it.",1407196800,3,480,4.482758620689655
8610981,5,B00EZVZKG4,"I am possibly jumping the gun by reviewing this item so soon after beginning the Dao Flow program, but I am so happy with the effect it has already had on my body in the week and a half that I've been using it that I want to share it with others. Whilst I'm not trying to get pregnant - which is one of the reasons one might follow the Dao Flow program - I have noticed in the last week and a half a reduction in the night sweats that were tormenting my sleep, and an improvement in my overall energy as well as increased warmth in my abdomen, which is an indicator of the enhanced energy flow in the reproductive area.

As a yoga devotee for the past 18 years, I was delighted to see that Dr Saraswati Markus is a true yogi. During the program, much emphasis is placed on our connection with nature and all that there is, and reminders of the importance of being very present, both in and out of our practice, can only enhance the effect of the yoga on body and mind.

With four separate high-quality yoga sessions and an additional disc full of extra information and insights, this is an incredible bargain.",1402272000,4,1109,4.251184834123222
8610982,5,B00EZVZKG4,"Saraswati's benevolent and safe energy exudes through this DVD set.  Women's health & fertility can be very complex. However, Saraswati has created a yoga & healing system that is easy to follow and integrate into one's daily practice.  Saraswati's extensive knowledge & wisdom of the woman's body through ancient and more current methods of healing is woven into this series seamlessly.  Saraswati will teach you how to create sacred space and nourish yourself so you can reach your deepest healing potential.
I was excited to learn how to move stagnant energy and get my overall circulation flowing more freely.
As you watch each disc & phase you will find many informational gems & self-care tools that promote fertility in a healthy & balanced way.
Along with boosting fertility, I would also recommend this DVD to any woman looking to enliven her body, mind & spiritual connection.
Namaste~

8610983,5,B00EZVZKG4,"Saraswatis knowledge of Chinese Medicine, Womans Health and Yoga are gracefully presented in this easy to follow yoga DVD. Her clear understanding of the subtle yet powerful intricacies of yoga and the female reproductive system is evident as she guides you through the practice. I use these practices to maintain balance and integrity throughout the ebb and flow of my menstrual cycle and in doing so I feel happier, healthier and more aware of my ever changing body. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to maintain a balanced menstrual cycle and anyone who wishes to conceive. Thank you Saraswati for sharing with us your deep knowledge of the complex functions of a womans body.",1382054400,2,692,4.923076923076923

With this beautiful boxed set of DVDs I get deep yoga, practical Chinese Medicine, and easily digestible pearls of wisdom that support me on a healing physical--even spiritual path. At home! Whether I follow the strong practices or apply Dr. Saraswati's modifications for something gentler, Dao Flow encourages me to listen to my body and practice according to my cycle--something I'd never before considered, though it makes perfect sense for balancing hormones, relieving menstrual symptoms, increasing my libido. The video is a treasure trove of healing medicine. And it's truly a work of art.",1381363200,,805,6.6761904761904765

As an Acupuncturist who specializes in fertility and treats alot of patients who struggle with infertility  I have to say Dao Flow Yoga, is a an absolute GEM. Not only the aesthetics of it is really pleasant to the eye and the music is serene and calming to the soul. But most importantly the sequence of movements are very easy to follow yet very powerful and rich in their effects on the reproductive cycles and women's health. I highly recommend it particularly I love the deep explanations of movements in terms of Chinese Medicine and women's health. For any woman who wants to be more familiar with her body and her moon cycles and learn it in the perspective of the ancient Chinese Medicine, this is the yoga movement I would highly recommend. I personally find Dao Flow Yoga to be also great for woman of all ages. This DVD is my top choice for all women who are trying to get pregnant!!!!",1381190400,,1106,5.35632183908046
