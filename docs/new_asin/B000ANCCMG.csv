8214355,2,B000ANCCMG,"I purchased this movie because obviously I love the movie and was hoping for a better quality version, because a movie this good deserves a good mastering but when I received it I quickly realized it was a copy of the movie in a mediocre quality. If you don't own the movie and want to have it, then buy it, better than not having it at all, but like the previous reviewer said, it is much inferior than the previous version which has much better video and audio quality, disappointing to say the least.",1522972800,,503,4.361702127659575
8214356,1,B000ANCCMG,"Unlike its product description, this is not 16x9 widescreen, but non-anamorphic 'flat' widescreen. The picture quality is visibly inferior to the 1998 non-anamorphic DVD, which I was hoping to upgrade. I was skeptical of purchasing this title, especially since the seller couldn't even be bothered to spell the title of the film correctly (it's 'Devil's Nightmare', not 'The Devil Nightmare'), so I guess the joke's on me.",1462924800,2,422,5.313432835820896
