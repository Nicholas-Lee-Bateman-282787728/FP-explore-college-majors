1332084,5,B00003OKRB,"How can you go wrong with a character named ""Stupid Bimbo""?  Played by Tracy Reed, a veteran of the TV series' ""Kojak"" and ""Love American Style,"" who later appeared in ""Knots Landing,"" ""McCloud,"" ""T.J. Hooker,"" ""Knightrider,"" and numerous others...

I bought this movie for the Sheik's harem girls, named after the days of the week; Sunday is my favorite!  But the music is good, too!  All of the harem girls dance; one of the them belly dances!",1236988800,,445,4.740259740259741
1332085,5,B00003OKRB,"Not only is Harry Williams a great singer, he has great acting skills.
This movie does wonders for the soul. It is rich of life and laughter.
It is one of the first musicals that had a semi-black cast.
Big UPS to Bloodstone!
Love Nikki!

1332086,3,B00003OKRB,this Film is Cool in it's Musical Productions.not much of a story. I caught it on BET Starz's the other Night.it did show the Shady Business  Manager. Good for some Laughs.,966470400,2,172,4.548387096774194
1332087,3,B00003OKRB,"To enjoy this movie, you cannot take it seriously. Just enjoy the music, forget about the plot.  I think of it as a cult type of movie.  It has 40's type of music in it.",921888000,2,169,3.8
7919218,5,B00003OKRB,Movie I have been waiting 40 years to see. Good music. Good choreography. Enjoyable story line.,1512604800,,95,5.0
7919219,4,B00003OKRB,"This is a good film for those who like old films and trains of course.
It really is a lot of fun and the musical numbers by Bloodstone are professional.
The story itself is a little weak, dialogue is mediocre. About on a par with Laugh-In or maybe Love American Style.
I like the Ronald Reagan presidency prediction. Uncanny.
I don't think many people get the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald characters, they just weren't as popular as W. C. Fields and some other performers.
All actors impersonating the classic film stars give inspired performances. They care about their work and it shows. Very excellent.
This is a fun worthwhile film but this release is old and it does show a bit. It could use an HD restoration but there are no disruptive flaws anywhere.
Audio quality is very good overall.

A decent little film, fine example of 1970s culture.",1493596800,,854,4.693333333333333
7919220,5,B00003OKRB,What's not to love when it comes to the singing group BLOODSTONE.  This movie is hilarious and I was thrilled to find it after so many years.,1455148800,,141,4.222222222222222

7919223,5,B00003OKRB,"I chose the 5 star rating because the DVD was brand new and in tip top shape. Bloodstone have been friends of mine for quite some time and they didn't have it in DVD format. Now that I am their Representative, i had to obtain a copy of it. I am very satisfied with the quality of the DVD. I would recommend your company to anyone who was looking for the best. Also, the turn around time from the time I ordered to the time it was received, was shorter than initially stated. So yes, I am very satisfied. I look forward to shopping with you again. Thank you.",1398729600,2,557,4.1192660550458715
7919224,5,B00003OKRB,This is one of my all time favorite films when I was a kid in the 70's. I was so happy to be able to locate and purchase this excellent quality of a dvd for my collection.,1397260800,,171,3.6486486486486487

7919226,5,B00003OKRB,"Bloodstone: Harry Williams,Willis Draften Jr. Charles Love and Charles Mc Cormick have never been given the props they really deserved! Although the story line was not as strong as most people would like,the acting and the music more than made up for it! It actually was hilarious at times! With a soundtrack,although not really strong on the charts,it is legendary! ""What Do I Have To Do"" would have made Nat King Cole Proud. ""You're My Kind Of Girl"" was also a winner! Their rendition of ""Money"" is a Classic! The title track ""Train Ride"" was performed with precision,class,and smooth,silky vocal harmonies! All of the songs were great,but these are my personal favorites!

These Men have been in the same class as the Dells,and many other soul groups. Before there was auto-tune,protools,and digital recording,there was Bloodstone! Back in the day,you had to sing,there was no other way! There were no electronic enhancements to help you! Sadly Charles Love passed away in 2014,Willis Draften Jr. in 2002,Melvin Webb in 1982,and Roger Durham in 1973.

They still perform regularly,with the same great showmanship they have displayed for many years,since 1962. This was the only big screen work for them. The movie was never properly promoted at the box office,and was shelved for years (Made In 1976) until it was released on DVD in 2000.

All the other actors did a tremendous job as well! You will enjoy this!",1300147200,2,1414,5.008510638297873
