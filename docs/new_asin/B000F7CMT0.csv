Anyhow back to the dvd, it's a cracking show and even though not as good as series 1 and 2, it's still light years aHead of any other rubbish that passes as tele these days.",1167436800,17,332,4.203125
2554499,5,B000F7CMT0,"What a wonderful series and for sure the last episode, titled ""the Best time is now"". Though we may all want to return to the nostaglic days of James Herriot, we are reminded in the last episode to seize the day ...Carpe Diem!

2554501,5,B000F7CMT0,Excellent for family viewing. Each story is told as a complete episode in the on going life of veterianian Al Wight pen name James Herriot. Herriot was an excellent writer judging by his having sold over 60 mollion copies his books world wide. The venue is the beautiful Yorkshire dales where Herriot practiced his trade. The stories contain happy and sad and the humorous episodes that follow most of us around as we walk down life's corridors.,1475020800,2,445,4.792207792207792

2554524,5,B000F7CMT0,I have the series 1-5 so was thrilled to get #6. This is by far my absolute favorite series. I also own all the books that James Harriet ( Jim White) wrote and have read them all. This DVD series follows the stories perfectly. The actors have truly captured the characters in the books.,1386720000,,286,4.314814814814815
2554525,5,B000F7CMT0,"I saw this when it was first on back in the 70's. When I finally saw that it was on DVD I bought all the seasons and the extras,2 movie's and a final season done in 1990 which includes a get together of most if the original cast members. I love the show. Its funny yet serious and if you watch it enough you want to be a country Vet and think you can do most of the work yourself.",1379116800,2,380,3.7625
2554526,5,B000F7CMT0,"This set of James Herriot stories is just as much fun as the previous ones,

2554528,4,B000F7CMT0,"I highly recommend all these James Harriott based All Creatures Great & Small DVDs  series.  Veterinary business in an 'in-your-face'  real life type setting.  Obviously not for all individuals, but all DVDs are not for all people either.  This is farm life from birth to death; success to defeat; loving to deplorable.",1366588800,2,319,5.0576923076923075
2554529,5,B000F7CMT0,"This completes my collection, and the whole series is excellent. I first saw this series in the late 70's while we were stationed at RAF  Feltwell.",1366156800,,147,4.653846153846154
2554530,5,B000F7CMT0,"The series holds up well, and it was a delight to revisit the world of ""James Herriot"", with the Farnon brothers, all of Tristan's girl friends, Mrs. Pomphrey and Wicky Woo, Helen, and all of the local farmers with their reluctance to pay the ""brass"" for veterinary services rendered, especially if the critter died. Anyone who loves animals and clean entertainment will enjoy this set and all the others in the series.

I watched the complete works, Series 1-specials, in a marathon. While the stories never tired me out, I must admit the theme song grew a bit wearisome after two repetitions per episode and dozens of episodes. I'll probably return to the series from time to time, but will watch it in more moderate chunks!",1360886400,,726,4.761904761904762

2554535,5,B000F7CMT0,"I feel that I received a great product at half the price I saw in a store.  The DVD was new.  I wasn't sure whar the term ""repackaged"" meant, I was afraid it was used.  However, there is no evidence of that.  The DVDs were just packaged so it was a thinner cover.",1308268800,,263,3.9056603773584904
2554536,5,B000F7CMT0,I am absolutely loving watching and owning this charming collection. These characters are timeless and I love the leisure of watching this series with no time constraints. Initially I was only able to find a few of the series at Barnes and Noble and paid an exhorbitant price for those.  Through Amazon I was able to complete the entire series at a fantastic price spending a few moments online.  They were speedily delivered and in perfect condition.  In future I will always look to Amazon first for classics like these and for those hard to find items that would take weeks in a brick and mortar search.,1284854400,2,606,4.644859813084112

2554539,4,B000F7CMT0,"This is one of the most entertaining seasons on DVD of ""All Creatures.""  Callum and Dierdre finally tie the knot; we see Tristan for a while, after being absent from the series for a number of episodes. The quality of the photography is better than in previous years; no more of the video in interior shots and disjointed film for outdoor shots. Now, it's all on video. A must for your ""All Creatures"" collection.",1252454400,4,413,4.581081081081081

 I shipped it back 04/12/2017 / 9:41 A.M.. It's been over 2 weeks and haven't heard from sender or received my money back from ""Movie whatever"".
