8057818,5,B00097DX5I,"In the world of DVD presentations, it seems only the superstars get showcased. On this disc, the superstar is Kiri Te Kanawa, one who has achieved world wide fame, as it should be. Her choice of songs and arias and duets, in my opinion, were gems because they are not generally associated with the roles for which Dame Kiri has attained great success. It is the other showcased stars of this program that makes this disc special. Malvina Major, another New Zealander, is a bright, bright star in her own right. She is seen here in her later career. The voice has not lost is beauty. A real treat is having her on the program. Baritone Edward Scorgie, Soprano Sarah Jane Rennie, and Helen Medlyn (not given credit on the album cover) made major contributions to this gala and should not be overlooked for praise. Simon O'Niell has a beautiful voice, most suited however, to the Bernstein piece. He does not lack passion in his presentations. The timbre and range of his voice were insufficient for the arias he chose to perform but I am going to chalk that up to nervousness. This is a recommended purchase.",1388016000,,1106,4.619289340101523
8057819,5,B00097DX5I,"What can you say about Dame Kiri and her friends. Even though there are other Australians on the DVD, it all Kiri! Wonderful program. It was delivered promptly and wrapped well for travel and the post office. Great company to buy from and I will keep them on my ""active"" list for the future. A+++++++++++",1364083200,,304,4.545454545454546
8057820,3,B00097DX5I,"A long, well-balanced program of several works by Mozart and Puccini, well-delivered, most notably by New Zealand's Opera legends Dame Kiri De Kanawa and Dame Malvina Major.

I found some minor technical problems in the camera work and edits; and in the synchronization, unless (gulp...pause) there was some lyp-syncing. If that was a necessity, then less close-ups should have been used.

The jacket art is most disagreeable, with a poor split-screen cropping of the stunning Diva.",1178928000,,482,5.328947368421052
8057821,4,B00097DX5I,"I will always worship Kiri Te Kanawa. She's the reason I pursued vocal studies. I've seen her on the recital stage three times and once at the Met, and I own every recording and video she's ever released. I've even got performances that I taped from such sources as PBS and Today Show, not to mention a couple of radio broadcasts. So, you might say that I'm a fan.

This DVD, The Gala Concert, was taped one week before Kiri's 60th birthday. She's still a class act through her stage presence and obvious love for singing. The voice is not what it was, naturally, and I give her great credit for singing some of her concert standards, e.g. ""Depuis le jour,"" ""Chi'il bel sogno di Doretta,"" etc., that really can test any soprano's range and stamina.  By the end of the concert, she still had a voice, which is proof that she knows what she's doing.

I admire her for launching a foundation to nurture the careers of young singers, which is why I didn't mind buying this DVD (supposedly, the proceeds from the sale go toward her foundation), but other buyers should not expect too much from the performances presented on this DVD. I rate it as 4 stars, mainly for the reason the concert was performed. (If it hadn't been a benefit concert, I would have to give it 2 stars simply because I don't care for the other singers featured on the program.)",1151625600,,1345,4.459349593495935
