196533,4,1578482305,"Calista Flockhart delivers a fantastic performance in this powerful, compelling, and intriguing independent film.  The brilliance of the script is really amazing.  It's wonderful to see Calista in a different role than  what the audience is used to seeing her in.  Jane is a mesmerizing and  complex character filled with all the regular human emotions taken to an  even deeper depth than we have in the real life.  The character is so true  and emotionally open, and it's easy to feel empathetic towards her.  ""Jane Doe"" is a great movie that serious-minded drama fans can  really savor for all it's worth.",959472000,6,607,4.920792079207921

196584,1,1578482305,"Why they cast her in the lead is a mystery to me. Calista's street cred is about as authentic as Bill Clinton in Ray-bans blowing 2 note scales on a sax while giving a cheesy thumbs-up afterwards. I mean, come on, it's a softie tryin' to play a hardened, strung-out drug addict!! At the very least consider try casting a female lead who's a New Yorker. Everyone else on the cast spoke that ""way"" except her.
An archetypal standard that comes to mind of this genre is Sid n ' Nancy, now that's a good flick. Oldman and Webb have great chemistry in it, set in New York City back in the 80's, the depiction of the drug-relationship is much more accurate; gritty and chalk full of realism. Whereas, this film actually irked me to no end in the sense that I perceived a caricaturing in the notion of drug addiction as being some kind of avenue onto which they could just drive down and romanticize wile fleecing us with heady masturbatory philandering. It feels more like volunteer street theatre that was put to film.",1426377600,,1013,4.481081081081081

196586,1,1578482305,"Calista was terrible. Just terrible. I suffered through the movie hoping the story line would make up for her over-acting and silly performance, but it didn't.

196587,3,1578482305,"I picked this movie because it looked lonely and unreviewed on Amazon Instant Watch.  Let's see how it goes!

* Made in 1995, prepare for low-def and square picture

* Starts out with three full minutes of bad trumpet music and unimpressive credit sequences shot on the streets of Atlantic City

* 7 minutes in, oddly quirky but almost intolerably trite and cliche.  Dude in run-down apartment, shags abused girl on first date...

* 9 minutes in, amazingly poor acting

* 10 minutes in, morbid twist.  No spoilers but I'm amused.

OK, summing up, this is at times somewhat cute but essentially just a standard made-for-tv movie melodrama.  Nothing special but mildly amusing",1425513600,6,674,4.884955752212389
196588,3,1578482305,"Jane Doe is a star vehicle for Calista Flockhart, and if you find her cute, adorable, and irresistible, like her boyfriend Harrison Ford does, you will like this film, at least the first part, before she begins her inevitable downward spiral.

If you liked Ally McBeal, and wondered what would happen if you incorporated her quirkiness onto an alcoholic street waif, look no further. Flockhart has always walked that tightrope between annoying and extremely annoying. Lately she is playing a sort of Ann Coulteresque character, Kitty Walker, on the TV Drama, Brothers & Sisters. But Jane Doe, or Pictures of Baby Jane Doe, is a chance to see Calista perform calisthenics, as it were. A young unknown actor flexing her thespian muscles in an indie (Not an Indiana Jones) film.

They meet ""cute"" in a tranny bar, where the young protagonist is a bartender. ""Who do I have to **** to get a cream soda around here?"" is her memorable opening quote, and when they immediately start making out, you have to wonder why, given the circumstances, he didn't kick the tires first, or at least glance under the hood. But after what could be a one-night fling, he asks her to move in.

This genre of film kind of reminds me of Woody Allen films. A writer, or some other creative individual, meets a woman who is much too pretty for him. Her desirability index is way off the charts, and his barely registers. But he is a writer, and she is crazy, and that is the great equalizer. The trouble with these thinly veiled autobiographical films is that the writer can resist every temptation, except the one to give into his wish fulfillment impulse, and also the impulse to make himself the hero, and instead of seeing the (at least) two sides to every relationship, we see only the self aggrandizing one where the long suffering hero does everything he can to save and succor the sweet young thing, but she is crazy, ungrateful, and in spite of his efforts to save her, she is drawn to tragedy like a moth to a flame.

This movie was written and directed by Paul Peditto, but he cast what I assume was his younger, better-looking brother, Christopher as ""himself.""

I have a few qualms and quibbles with this film, but if you are anything other than a die-hard Flockhart fan, you have no business watching it in the first place.

There is a toy duck that is a ham fisted symbol for Jane. OK, I got it, but how do you get down off a duck's back? Then, there is a tattoo of the word ""urgent"" and the phrase ""handle with care"" tattooed onto Jane's torso. Some photos that Horace, the film's leading man, has plastered on his wall also feature this tattoo, but on a different model. Horace looks and notices this, but this loose end is never tied into a convincing bow.

In the beginning he types the paradoxical Zen koan: ""Chaos is the rule. Predictability is the exception."" He never really develops this philosophical view point, or shows any evidence that he is capable of an original thought. How then, was he able to write the script for the film and obtain the financing, and direct it? Maybe younger brother better-looking Christopher had the looks, but not the brains, and was not able to convincingly portray a character of that mental magnitude. The movie starts in the gritty streets of New York, but then migrates to Atlantic City, New Jersey. There is a scene where he takes Craps lessons, and the Craps instructor is a very compelling character, but nothing is made of it. This plot twist offered a whole league of possibilities, but it was dropped like a hot potato. His philosophy of chaos, also never followed up on. It does lead to the inevitable Einstein quote about ""God doesn't throw dice."" This is part of Vince's (Joe Ragno) Craps class. This would be a good epiphany, but we don't see Horace pursuing a career in the casinos.

There is a good scene of high infidelity when Lucinda (Elina Lwensohn) comes to stay for a few days. But it suffers from the aforementioned temptation to skew the situation so every sin on the writer/director's part is exculpated and mitigated by extenuating circumstances. His character's excuse, that he did it to get her attention, falls flat.

The opening title sequence (Cinematography by Toshiaki Ozawa), a night shot of the Atlantic City, New Jersey neon set to cool jazz complete with a Miles Davisesque muted trumpet (music by Bill Wandel) foretells a movie that unfortunately fails to materialize.

She is just like a totally different person. her appearance, language and gesture are something I have never seen before.
