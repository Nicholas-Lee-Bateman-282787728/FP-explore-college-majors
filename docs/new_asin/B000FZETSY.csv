2594746,2,B000FZETSY,"Mister Roberts was the best of the four movies. The other three movies weren't very good. Henry Fonda made much better movies than the three other movies in this ""Signature Collection"" Buying used might be worth the money. Paying full price is not.

2594747,2,B000FZETSY,"This entire collection was probably a bad idea for several reasons, but not because these aren't good movies.

1. All of these movies are available individually on DVD and were for some time before this collection was released. Thus, this set really only works as a discount collection because you are buying all four DVDs together versus the individual price.

2. Three of the four movies are in other Warner Home Video DVD collections. ""Advise and Consent"" is in the ""Controversial Classics"" collection. It is an excellent set, and if you are a collector of classic movies you are probably going to eventually want that one. Also, if you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, ""The Wrong Man"" is also included in the ""Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection"", which is also a very good set. ""Battle of the Bulge"" is in the ""World War II Collection - Battlefront Europe"", also an excellent set. This leaves you with ""Mr. Roberts"" as the only DVD that isn't already in some other Warner Home Video collection. It is notable not only for Fonda's excellent performance but for the fact that it was the beloved William Powell's last appearance in a motion picture and one of Jack Lemmon's first.

3. Finally, let's face it, Fonda's best work was probably done in films under the control of 20th Century Fox, not in the films controlled by Warner Home Video. However, I have to wonder, with all of the duplication going on in this set, why didn't Warners include two excellent films starring Fonda that were made for Warner Brothers - 1963's ""Spencer's Mountain"", which was the basis for the TV series ""The Waltons"", and 1966's ""Big Hand for the Little Lady"", which is not even on DVD yet.

Nobody else has mentioned the extras on the individual DVD's, so I do that next:

Advise and Consent - There is a commentary track by Drew Casper who seems to really love everything Otto Preminger ever did. There is also a theatrical trailer that runs four minutes that has ""making-of"" footage. Unfortunately that footage acts as a spoiler for the plot.

Battle of the Bulge - There are two featurettes included. ""The Filming of Battle of the Bulge"" runs nine minutes and is narrated by Henry Fonda. ""History Re-Created"" is an eight minute program with short interviews with producer Milton Sperling and star Robert Shaw. There is also a theatrical trailer.

Mr. Roberts - Includes an excerpt of an Ed Sullivan Toast of the Town tribute episode with comments from producer Leland Hayward and scenes acted by James Cagney, Henry Fonda, and Jack Lemmon. You also get a clip from a documentary (Fonda on Fonda) which covers Henry Fonda's involvement with both the play and the movie, as well as a moment from a tribute at the Kennedy Center Honors. Jack Lemmon provides partial commentary on the movie.

The Wrong Man - Includes a 20-minute documentary featurette from Laurent Bouzereau that is pretty interesting. Also included is the theatrical trailer.

I would say that if you want all four of these films and know for a fact you will never want any of the three DVD Collections that contain three of the four included films, this set acts as a good discount bundle. Otherwise, just get ""Mr. Roberts"".",1180828800,4,3179,4.765454545454546
2594748,5,B000FZETSY,"I bought this set because it had two of my favorite Henry Fonda movies included - Mister Roberts and Battle of the Bulge. I already owned Advise and Consent from another movie collection, but The Wrong Man was a new one for me. An excellent way to spend a weekend!",1172966400,3,264,4.3
2594749,5,B000FZETSY,"I don't understand all of these negitive reviews. Are not the films in this box set all good? The answer is yes and 5 stars if you are a Henry Fonda fan. I'm so sick of people giving poor ratings to a box. It's the movies that you should rate in the box. Stop being mad at a company that releases a few films in a bundle. If you already have the movies then don't buy the damn box set, but at least give these good movies from a fine actor the reviews that they deserve.

And liezl (the connoisseur) You should pay attention to what you are reviewing!

2594750,3,B000FZETSY,"I do agree with other reviews - there's not much here and it's all already available.  But I do have to comment on something I see over and over in these reviews - Warner Brothers doesn't own the rights to every movie ever made.  The reason they can't include his great Western ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is because the rights are owned by Paramount Pictures, and ""Grapes of Wrath"" is owned by 20th Century Fox, just to name two.",1158192000,9,433,4.2682926829268295
2594751,2,B000FZETSY,"Henry Fonda is one of Hollywood's icons and one of my favorite actors.  Mr. Fonda has such a prolific film career that one can easily put together a sizable box set e.g. John Wayne's.

The films selected in this collection makes no sense and didn't do Mr. Fonda justice.  Very few people will be interested in ordering it.  2 stars for the collection.",1157932800,3,351,4.523809523809524
2594752,2,B000FZETSY,"I love the WB Signature Collections. I honestly wait to buy some of the DVDs until the signature collections come out now that the studio is showing signs of releasing new ones on a regular basis. If I already have the movie, I just re-sale the previous copy I had before.

As to what the last person said, I agree that many of these DVDs are already released. When they first came out with the signature collections (Alfred Hitchcock, Cary Grant, and Elvis), only one movie out of the 23 or so in these three collections had already been released. However, now it's gone to the point where just about all of them have been released.

Like I said, I usually wait to buy the DVDs until they're contained in a box set like these, but I have to complain that the studio hasn't changed or altered the previous release or packaging--they just put three or four of the previous movies together and throw them in a box for resale. If they really want this to be a true signature collection, I believe they aught to improve the packaging and not just the outer box.

On a last note, I'm happy to see that Henry Fonda is coming out. However, I'm not pleased to see that one of the movies has already been released in a previous signature collection (The Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection under the title ""The Wrong Man""). Now when they re-release DVDs, that can be just a bit annoying as already mentioned, but when they put the same released in the same collection, that just pisses me off. I hope that's not set in stone and I hope the studio decides to either put another movie in there, or take that one out. After all, there were three Cary Grant movies in the Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection that DID NOT repeat in the Cary Grant Signature Collection. They didn't repeat them then so why are they repeating them now?",1150761600,9,1823,4.484939759036145

8127973,4,B000FZETSY,"With the exception of an overlong and rather turgid military epic, ""Battle of the Bulge,"" this is a strong collection for Henry Fonda fans. It presents the actor in movies with a range of themes and fine supporting actors like Jack Lemmon, Charles Laughton, Walter Pidgeon, Burgess Meredith, Gene Tierney, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews, James Cagney, and Vera Miles. Great directors are also represented in Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful crime drama ""The Wrong Man"", Otto Preminger's superb political piece ""Advise and Consent"", and John Ford's entertaining wartime comedy ""Mister Roberts.""

All four DVDs offer trailers and other extras including commentary on the Preminger and Ford films and featurettes on the other two. ""Mister Roberts"" has excerpts from Ed Sullivan's TV series ""Toast of the Town,"" paying tribute to the actor, and from the documentary ""Fonda on Fonda,"" covering his work on the play and the movie. (For your information, this low-priced set, containing four separate cases in a slipcover, has been re-released in a single compact case and re-titled ""Turner Classic Movies - Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Henry Fonda."" Many buyers will prefer this repackaging as it reduces the bulk of the box by three-fourths.)",1421452800,7,1243,5.374358974358974

8127975,5,B000FZETSY,"ADVISE AND CONSENT is a devastating political film of what goes on behind the scenes in Washington. This is a good film about the nomination of Henry Fonda for Secretary of State. The only problem is that Fonda has a skeleton hidden in his closet and he perjures himself. The film then shifts focus from Fonda to all the people trying to uncover dirt upon dirt from both sides of the political arena. It is a very interesting film and again we see Preminger as the master technician manipulating the almost documentary style of drama. This film has one of the best casts every assembled and performances to match. Charles Laughton, George Grizzard, Walter Pidgeon, Don Murray, Franchot Tone, Lew Ayres, Burgess Meredith, Gene Tierney, Peter Lawford, Will Geer and young Eddie Hodges are all featured. This film is an exhausting experience and you can really feel for some of the characters. The finale of this drama leaves the viewer numb. THE WRONG MAN has a semi documentary feel about it and an interesting score composed by Bernard Herrmann. THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE is a big single lens CINERAMA production of the WWII battle. Director Ken Annakin's single lens Cinerama epic is a condensation of time, characters and events of the real last ditch W.W.II German offensive. Though not historically accurate it looks back to the glory days of Warner Brothers' BATTLE CRY for inspiration. It did manage to find scope and it does not fail to entertain. Robert Shaw is excellent as the determined Nazi tank division commander Colonel Hessler. But the real standout performance is given by the long forgotten veteran actor George Montgomery as the seasoned American Sergeant who takes the green Lieutenant (James McArthur) under his wing. It also stars Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Telly Savalas, Dana Andrews, Charles Bronson, Ty Hardin, Pier Angeli, Barbara Werle, Hans Christian Blech and Werner Peters. Cinematographer Jack Hildyard and aerial photographer Jack Willoughby were in charge of the sweeping and panoramic photography. Despite all its controversy, it has a certain grandeur about it. The I remember submitting a review of MISTER ROBERTS on the day I heard of Jack Lemmon's passing. I believe it was on June 28, 2001 or thereabouts. The review went something like this: The U.S.S. Reluctant has set sail on her final voyage. The U.S.S. Hewell was the actual 250-ton cargo ship at the naval base at Midway, which doubled for the U.S.S. Reluctant used to film MISTER ROBERTS. Henry Fonda was Lieutenant (jg) Doug Roberts or just known as beloved Mister Roberts to his crew. Mister Roberts was a man of dignity and honor who just wanted to do his part in the war. Instead Mister Roberts is rendered impotent on the U.S.S. Reluctant commanded by a hot-tempered, eccentric basically uneducated Captain brilliantly played by James Cagney. The script under the tenure of director John Ford mixed his usual comic military camaraderie with the despair of the sailors stuck in remote out of action sea-lanes and ports during World War II in the South Pacific. In effect the Captain represents the enemy to the crew and the dregs of the naval officer corps to Mister Roberts. The ever stoic Roberts finds solace in the crew (Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Perry Lopez, Tige Andrews and many others), a fatherly William Powell as Doc and Jack Lemmon as Ensign Pulver. Jack Lemmon won an Oscar for his role as the knee-jerk compulsive and glib wheeler-dealer Ensign Pulver. The Captain shows no compassion for the crew and it seems that his only real feelings are for a palm tree he keeps on deck. As events unfold and personalities clash into a final confrontation and the realities of war hit home it is the unlikely Ensign Pulver who does a 180-degree turn at the film's closing shot. Henry Fonda, William Powell, Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Ken Curtis and even the Captain James Cagney among many other members of the crew of the U.S.S. Reluctant have now left us. Today I read of Jack Lemmon. I suppose the `Order of the Palm Leaf' has now been passed from the hand of its final owner and now rests below the calm blue waters of the South Pacific. As the U.S.S. Reluctant turns its final bend into the sunset we say, ""Goodnight Mister Roberts, Goodnight Ensign Pulver. Godspeed."" All four films presented here are very entertaining. I think Henry Fonda's talents really come into play in MISTER ROBERTS. Yet, his presence in ADVISE AND CONSENT brings a certain stature and credibility to that film.",1381104000,,4516,4.8738621586475945

8127977,4,B000FZETSY,"The signature collection is flawed only in the sense that it is reduced to just four films. However, that being said, the collection harkens back to the day when Hollywood told stories about life unlike today's films where the box office is the bottom line as opposed to entertainment value. This is evidenced by the fact that today's films must make X amount of dollars at the box office opening week-end or be doomed to short theater runs and obscurity in the DVD rental arena.
