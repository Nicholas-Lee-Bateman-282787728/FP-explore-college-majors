4860815,5,B005R1KQZQ,"I found the detailed instructions and demonstrations in this video easy to follow and motivating. The exercises can be practiced individually or as a group which gives me the freedom to practice for 10 minutes or a full hour. After only a few practices, I have experienced a fuller range of motion in my neck. I was very pleased to find exercises that are comfortable and encouraging to my 64-year-old body that has experienced a few injuries over the years. I can practice these exercises without fear of further injury. The gentle reeducation of movement has guided my under-used and overprotected muscles into a more relaxed and usable state. I am grateful that the recurring stiffness and pain in my neck and legs have diminished considerably. I would recommend this video to anyone who wants a healthier and more comfortable body.

8483965,1,B005R1KQZQ,"This is a Hanna Somatics introduction.  There is no Yoga on these DVD's.  Maybe second set of DVD's has actual Yoga classes but I'm not about to spend another $33.00 to find out.  I cannot recommend this DVD title.  The title is misleading with ""Gentle Yoga"" in larger type, but the real title is ""Somatic Exploration"".  For Hanna Somatics refer to Martha Peterson.",1486944000,,365,4.73015873015873

8483967,5,B005R1KQZQ,"This worked perfectly to clear my knee and hip pain as well as begin the process of increasing my flexibility in all my joints.  It's been literally years since I've had (or taken) the time for regular exercise and this was a great way to ease back into it.  He shows and talks through the motions so I can keep my eyes closed and focus on my body and muscles.
This has always been a problem for me with other programs.  I seem more focused on watching the instructor than on my own internal awareness of what my body is doing and how it is reacting. I found This to be an excellent method for guiding me as a student.",1465171200,2,618,4.133333333333334
8483968,5,B005R1KQZQ,"I really love this video. Its a slower pace (which is essential)  very relaxing and helps the brain remember its prior function. I started this after a serious knee injury and it really worked not only on the knee but the whole body now functions free from pain. The first video I really enjoy doing. I also love Martha Peterson's video, which is faster paced and has a lot of content. In short the two complement one another. It's just a matter of personal preference, but if you can afford it get both.",1451692800,5,504,4.419354838709677

8483970,3,B005R1KQZQ,"I'm a yoga teacher and appreciating some more in-depth instructions.
The cost of this was more than what it was worth.
The instructions are explicit, but not enough to warrant this cost.",1392076800,8,186,4.84375
8483971,5,B005R1KQZQ,"I don't know why someone found it necessary to compare this DVD with Martha Peterson's, they are both great. I have fibromyalgia and do a lot of exercise. Sometimes, I am in just too much pain and too tight. Both James Knight and Martha Peterson's DVDs have been extremely helpful. Both instructors have excerpts from their videos on YouTube.",1377648000,10,342,4.813559322033898
8483972,5,B005R1KQZQ,Very good for relaxation and overall muscle tightness. This DVD is flexible to your needs as it offers 20 minute units that you can play and mix and match according to your body's needs at the time. The breathing excercised are really nice and you learn how to slow your self down and I really enjoy the music. It reminds me of a high class spa. Something that everyone would like to experience.,1372636800,5,395,4.424657534246576
8483973,5,B005R1KQZQ,"This Somatic Yoga DVD is the best I have come across!!  I have tried many different ones only to find the other ones lacking in instruction and in the variety of poses shown.  James Knight takes his time to explain the moves in great detail, taking his time to show and give instructions for both sides of the body.  I felt like I was with a master instructor that taught me the proper way to release pain, something that I didn't know was possible. His knowledge shines through in all the poses.

Each workout is 30 minutes or longer and unique from each other.  The yoga moves are different from other forms of yoga. It's not crazy balancing poses or positions that are challenging. It doesn't cause you to break a sweat, it is a healing type workout.

Somatic yoga involves tightening up muscles and completely relaxing them which increases your flexibility and decreases if not releases all pain. The yoga poses are done in a sitting position or laying on the floor.  If you are challenged getting on the floor, you probably could do this in bed.  You don't need tons of energy to do the poses.  I have lots of weakness in my body due to health issues and I was able to complete all the moves myself.  James includes in the workout meditation which helps the Somatic moves to be incorporated in your body so you are able to reset your pain levels. It feels like your body is aligned when you are done with the DVDs.

I had severe pain issues caused by a neurological disorder and back injuries.  James explains ways to decrease the pain.  I was shocked the first time I did his DVD my pain was eliminated.  Honestly I was very shocked.  My lower back was hurting really bad from spending prolonged time bending over gardening. After doing James workout the first time, I was able to go several days without doing his workout, I improved so much. It

I can't thank James enough for this great workout.  Thanks to James, I can go longer between chiropractic visits.  If you have pain, this set of DVDs should help you out greatly.  I think you will be thrilled and can't go wrong with purchasing them.  If you want to feel good and become flexible at the same time, this is the workout for you.",1365206400,15,2196,4.4425
8483974,2,B005R1KQZQ,"I purchased this dvd because I liked that it was 3 segments targeting full body, lower and then upper.  I was disappointed because I didn't feel he gave enough instruction as to what you were working and why it should help.  I purchased 2 of Martha Peterson's Essential Somatics dvds afterwards and they have been most helpful.  I have been very pleased with them and they immediately began helping my muscular pain that I have from scoliosis and a labral tear in my left hip joint.  The dvds were well worth the money and I no longer even use this Gentle Yoga dvd.  Save yourself the $ and just purchase Martha's.",1363564800,17,614,4.495495495495495
