4463789,5,B004SKQAJI,"I am speechless (and breathless) after watching the latest reincarnation of The Lord of the Dance. Flatley is no spring chicken but is a cardiologist's dream in form and stamina. He dances with the vigor and precision of a 20 year old. The production is vibrant, colorful and endlessly inventive as it evolves from scene to scene. The direction of the film version seen here, the technical excellence visible throughout, the perfection of the dance and dancers; sorry to gush but as a long time fan of Flatley, I never thought I'd see the day when he would out-do himself. Dancers, actors, musicians, techies, rabid dance and theatre fans --- order this today. You won't regret it. What a glorious experience!",1309392000,16,709,4.867768595041323

4463807,3,B004SKQAJI,"Rather disappointing to be completely honest. Not very much of Michael dancing. More strutting  around than actual dancing. Michael is showing his ""age"" for sure. But this is only my opinion.",1444694400,,191,5.161290322580645

4463809,1,B004SKQAJI,"Pretty bad.  I bought this for my niece who enjoys dance, and I was very unimpressed.  While there was a good number, most of them are not good, and some are borderline sexist -- Don't want your young child watching scantily clad women dance sexually around a man?  Don't buy this.",1444348800,,281,4.470588235294118

4463816,5,B004SKQAJI,This is as close to being there as you can get.  We see lord of the dance recorded in real 3d and it's excellently done. Of course this is not a movie with a plot it's a live stage show about dancing and the 3d is a added bonus.  The picture looks great here and if you can't see this show when it comes to your town you can watch this and get a good idea how awesome the dancing here is.  These people are athletes of dancing! .  So if you are a 3d collector this one is for you. And if you want to watch the show in 2d you can too.  If you want to watch a great stage show too this won't do you wrong.,1435968000,,603,3.643410852713178

4463819,3,B004SKQAJI,"I hope this doesn't sound creepy, but the women isn't that beautiful then the old dvd version of Lord Of the Dance.. I know we all well look old someday, but a least pick out beautiful ladies.. The women are 5 or below.. maybe two 8 on a 1-10 scale .. The energy isn't there plus the music is off key in certain area of this blu ray version.

I hope if there a next New version of Lord of the Dance, he'll pick women are much more  beautiful.

One of the TOP reason I purchase this to see HOT WOMEN dancing around in there cute outfit..  boy I was disappointed .. maybe thats why the price is so cheap ..

Oh well, ill continue and wishing one day Ill find that blu ray that well make me happy..",1433808000,,695,3.971223021582734

4463831,3,B004SKQAJI,"For the price, you get front row seats to Traditional Irish and synchronized dancing.  That's the good news.  Bad news, you'll end up fast forwarding past the parts you don't like.  There is a lot of filler in here.  Much of the contemporary dancing feels amateurish and dated. (So You Think You Can Dance puts it to shame.)  But the traditional parts are so worth it.  The Barbie doll fiddlers in their gorgeous Barbie doll costumes are timeless and amazing.

4463838,5,B004SKQAJI,"This is a brilliant production.  He has enhanced a wonderful traditional art form to a production that is dazzlingly spectacular, sexy and very entertaining.  The use of 3D adds to the entertainment value wonderfully.  I watched this with my 10 year old granddaughter and she loved it also.  Good entertainment transcends all ages.  The talking at the beginning is a bit dull and should have been held over as optional additional scenes for those who want to see it.",1424649600,,466,4.848101265822785

4463844,5,B004SKQAJI,"I had always liked the first Lord of the Dance, but wished it had been done in high def for the big screen. This is it, although a slightly shorter version ( less the singing parts of the original) New costumes, new lighting, etc. Very impressive, especially on a 120"" projection screen. 3D is OK , but not a big plus for this production.

4463848,5,B004SKQAJI,"The 'Lord of the Dance' returns and Michael Flatley and his spectacular dance troupe, with him. In this sold out performance of his 2011 European Tour, filmed LIVE in Dublin, Ireland and in London, England, Flatley and company, do not disappoint. In fact, his performance is superb and what's not to like, is more like it?! It captivates audiences worldwide with breathtaking dances that will astound and amaze you. And, as if this phenomenal dance production wasn't enough, included on this DVD disc, comes the bonus features of a 'behind the scenes' look, along with deleted scenes. Plus, the feature and extra subtitles are in no less than 10 languages, besides English. And the sound? How about 5.1 Dolby Digital/2.0 LPCM?! And if you're not a dancer before watching this dancing extravaganza, you will want to at least get out and onto the dance floor, after viewing this. So, have fun and enjoy and save a dance, for me!

4463853,5,B004SKQAJI,"I thought this was a wonderful new version of a classic and timeless dance show. I loved the new costumes and the background lighting and scenery. The whole show is tighter and more cohesive with the elimination of some of the scenes, although I'm glad the deleted scenes were included in the extra features. Michael is still up to the demands of the role, and the show is always better with him in it. It is pretty amazing that he can still dance like he does and no matter how old he gets, I think he will always be a great showman!",1411257600,,534,4.245098039215686

The main detractor in this is that it seems to always be about Michael Flatley - and without the rest of the people, it's not of much interest.

4463862,3,B004SKQAJI,"I loved the original Lord of the Dance, but this one did not compare to the first.  The quality of the dvd was very poor.
It was too dark, you had a hard time seeing what was going on.  Very Disappointed. My suggestion, buy the original..",1398729600,,238,4.1521739130434785

4463864,3,B004SKQAJI,"I had high hopes for this since I am a major fan of the original show as well as the riverdance show. However, my hopes were dashed as I watched the show. While the music and light production were wonderful it didn't have the same energy and enchantment as the original. I know a lot of people liked this updated version but I just couldn't get into it like I could the original. The costumes for this version were a distraction as I didn't like them due to the fact that they didn't seem to go with what was going on. The lead dancers, while good, didn't have the same charm and grace as the originals. A lot of their movements seemed forced and not nearly as smooth. Michael Flately definitely still has the moves and was as flawless as ever. Over all a decent show and worth a watch but if you've seen the originals it is hard to appreciate it like I use to.",1396224000,,861,4.192771084337349

The showmanship, choreography, and special effects from the costumes on up to the lighting, were all SUPERB!!!  You have to see his artistic footwork and that of his male and female members of his troupe, in order to believe that such talents exist!  You will NOT be disappointed!!!  Children, teens, and adults of all ages will enjoy this DVD for a long time!  I even gave it to my daughter who owns and runs a dance, Pilates, yoga, and massage therapy studio for all ages, and now she has invested in Celtic dance instruction after viewing his dancing become ALIVE with energy!

4463867,3,B004SKQAJI,"Someone said that once, that ""there is nothing new under the sun"". When it comes to Michael Flatley, that is apparently true. I loved the original Riverdance and it's a shame that 3D wasn't available when that was made. His choreography has become boring and his choices for principal dancers must be getting thin.

The quality of the image is fine, the sound, not so fine. Not enough time was spent on properly researching the soundscape, where to place microphones and later in post production, removing unwanted noises and enhance the important sounds.

A little underwhelming and outstays its welcome too early.",1393372800,,615,5.019607843137255

the original LOTD was not shot well. the camera angles were poor and the editing was very distracting.
This is far, far superior.
The camerawork is excellent, the production is a great improvement over the original and the picture quality is very clear. The soundtrack is magnificent and MF is a superhero on that stage.

I was excited when they came out with this new show! It definitely is more flashy and theatrical, but it is still captivating. They eliminated some numbers and also the singing portions; however, those are available in the special features. Michael Flatley definitely has aged, but he is still amazingly fast and talented! I definitely would recommend it - especially at the price!",1384732800,,519,4.714285714285714

4463876,1,B004SKQAJI,"I am a fan of Michael Flatley's ""Feet of Flames"" DVD and have gone to see ""Lord of the Dance"" live when it came to town.  I was excited to see that he did another performance DVD 10 years later and was hoping for something similar.  He basically stripped the show down to the group dances.  He eliminated the Irish singing.  The little spirit character was dressed like a court jester and his live musical performance with the other musicians just was not as good this time.  The show just failed overall.  The dancing was the same skillful performance, but I was struck by the change in the spirit of the show.  The ladies' costume changes were less of the Irish tradition, more revealing and immodest -- It is just not family friendly and it seems to just elevate lust rather than the good triumphing over evil as the original show attempted to do.  We enjoy the dancing for the sake of the talent and art and the healthy message of the original show; not for the sex appeal that Michael seems to think is now necessary.  The story became more of a parody of the original idea for the show.  Riverdance live in NY and Michael's ""Feet of Flames"" were superior and more worth the time if you are looking for outstanding Irish dancing for the family.",1384128000,,1249,4.43859649122807
4463877,5,B004SKQAJI,"I bought the DVD for mom & blu ray for me. As usual, I love it! I find it hard to believe Michael was over 50 in this performance! His feet sure still move fast. Yes, there is a little less dancing by him, but the quality of his dance is still A+. Wonderful also to see his leading lady Bernadette Flynn back. As mesmerizing as ever. Miss Gillian and Daire but the new cast was great! Love most of the new costumes and the set. My only complaint was that some of the video was a little too far back. Otherwise, great!",1383868800,,517,4.029126213592233
4463878,5,B004SKQAJI,"I have two ancient VHS tapes of the original ""Riverdance"" (1995, starring Michael Flatley) and the original ""Lord of the Dance"" (1996). They've been played so many times that I needed to replace them with DVD's. To my surprise, I can't find a DVD of ""Riverdance"" and the original ""Lord of the Dance"" is out of print, so only used copies are reasonably priced.

So I decided to give ""Michael Flatley Returns as Lord of the Dance"" a try. Filmed live in Dublin in 2011, this is Michael Flatly's first return to the stage as lead dancer in over a decade. I was sceptical. In 2011, Flatley was 53 years old! I know tap dancers who are amazing athletes in their 60's, but ""Lord of the Dance"" is very highpowered - would Flatley fall flat?

I am so pleased to say that he is still one incredible and amazing dancer. If you have the original from 1996 nearly memorized, you will realize that his arm movements are not as quick as they used to be. But his feet - his feet are still gold (even if his high-octane dance sets are a little shorter).

This show is 95 minutes of wonderful dancing (plus two more dances in the bonus extras). Some of the dances are new, some are favorites, generally updated. There are 16 scenes in the main movie, two being instrumental (those wonderful fiddles!). I did not realize that Flatley is a world-rated flautist who's won national competitions. He plays the flute in one of the instrumental numbers.

As expected, the ""Lord of the Dance"" number remains awesome. It and the final ""Planet Island"" dance have the set where the dancers are all in a line and do a sort of ""wave"", back and forth. If the first time you saw that wave your heart didn't just leap for the joy of it, you can't be human!  It is from the original ""Riverdance"" choreography and it just never gets old.

There are also two wonderful Bonus Features:
1.  ""Behind the Scenes Feature"" (20 minutes) This isn't just filler, I thought it was GREAT! Commentators include Michael Flatley, Tom Cunningham (plays Don Dorcha, the lead ""bad guy""), Bernadette Flynn (plays Saoirse, the White Lady of the Dance), Marie Duffy Pask (dance master), Ronan Hardman (composer), Ciara Sexton (plays Morrighan, the Bold Girl, that I used to call the Bad Girl, but I like Bold Girl better - no double-standard), Marcus Viner (film director), Mark Cunniffe (lighting and production designer).
Flynn had been with ""Lord of the Dance"" for 15 years, since the beginning. She's given star billing on the original DVD. Cunningham has been with the show 14 years. Pask and Hardman were with Flatley at the very beginning.
The absolute thrill of hearing all those taps sounding off in unison at supersonic speeds never grows old for me. In an interesting comment, Flatley says that experience, in the type of show they do, is crucial. The dancers ""are breathing and moving at lightening speed out there. Because hey have such remarkable experience.... When I""m onstage at the end of the encore, and you're got up to 50 dances on stage, and they're all dancing as fast as they possibly can. All hitting the floor several times a second at exactly the same time. That's not something that can be achieved overnight.... It takes years of practice.""

2. Deleted Scenes (16 minutes total):
A. ""Marble Halls"".  A singer sings ""Marble Halls"" (a song, originally from an opera, made famous by Enya). She has a beautiful voice, but I'm glad, for DVD ""movie"" purposes, that she is not part of the show.
B. ""Siamsa"". This is a full dance number that must have been cut just for time purposes, because it is a lovely dance. It is lighter with bright colors, spring and folk dancing.
C. ""Carrick Fergus"". The singer sings this Irish folk song.
D. ""Deleted Encore"". This is short, not a dance number. This show was filmed live in Dublin, and this is just the first presenting and bowing of lead dancers, musicians, ""Spirit"" and the singer at the end of the show. Then the non-dancers exit the stage and the actual encores begin (which remain in the film).

The DVD/Bluray is in 5.1 Dolby Digital/2.0 LPCM and aspect ratio 2.40:1.  Subtitles in English, Portuguese, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and German.

A WONDERFUL SHOW!

4463881,4,B004SKQAJI,"The performance was very good, but not as wonderful as previous Riverdance genre productions.  Most of the performers in this show were toddlers when Riverdance was born.  Michael is now old enough to be the father of most of his dancers.  He was visibly not satisfied with the level of audience reactions and used body language to attempt to elicit more enthusiasm from the crowd. Somewhat pathetic, unfortunately.  He deserves to have a huge ego with all of his amazing accomplishments, but it's time for age to bring on some humility.  It's getting time for the baton to be passed.  If Michael continues to headline performances instead of producing or directing behind the scenes, he will find himself increasingly disillusioned by audiences expecting good-old-(younger)-days performance quality.  Also, Michael kissing one of the young female dancers seemed unnecessary . . . an ego-driven gesture.  We all get old eventually and are forced to slow down.  It's Michael's time to face reality.",1376524800,,997,5.18125

And, since someday you'll PROBABLY upgrade to 3D----you'll be glad you spent a few extra bucks and splurged on this 3D version. It's really awesome. I upgraded my sound system particularly for this disc....the music is unbelievable and the stage presence is memorizing. I have no idea how these performers do what they do....it's definitely a crowd pleaser!

Word of warning to parents: this particular version does include much more risqu dances as compared to previous versions of Lord of the Dance. One particular scene has all the women strip down to their underwear to perform a dance in sync. This was a bit of a shock. Aside from this one dance----it's great family fun!",1363564800,,784,4.807407407407408
4463896,1,B004SKQAJI,"This 21st century take on Irish dancing was not good. Mind you, of course the dancing is a marvel, and the people are talented, but this production is a FLOP! Firstly, it says it's rated G. There is no way my child under the age of 13 would be watching this. When the girls rip their costumes off, and choose to go with bras and underwear... to me it just belittles what everyone puts so much work into. Every scene was either really really dark, (i.e. skulls and demons and chants), crude (i.e. girls ripping their clothes off and doing nothing but being seducive, or like a cartoon (i.e. super light, frilly, with a jester clown pretending to play the flute.) I don't care how much it is, save your money and by the new Riverdance Live in Beijing on Blu-Ray. Amazing production and quality. Still a timeless show. Lord of the Dance will never be that, because it tries SO HARD to be current that they over do it on every level.",1363219200,4,929,4.375722543352601

4463901,4,B004SKQAJI,"The 3D version of the Blu-ray starts with 30 seconds of FBI warning and studio logo, which cannot be skipped.  The performances are shot on enormous stages in large arenas.  The lighting is too weak to bring out the best in 3D, and spotlights sometimes shine in the camera.  Still, the camera handles the spotlights very well, and the production is astonishingly good for a live performance.  The biggest flaw is that the camera is usually too far from the performers.  When the camera does get close-up, it often chops off the lower half of dancers' bodies, while leaving ample space above their heads!  In spite of these flaws, this HD recording shines in 2D mode, and is definitely worth a watch.

It was totally worth it. The 3D effects are amazing; one of the best I've seen. The songs in the show have changed, probably a natural evolution. I was pretty disappointed when Siamsa was cut from the show when I saw it live last year. But I was very happy to see it included in the Deleted Scenes. The new songs are pretty rocking.

It is little wonder that the reviews of the ""flatty"" version are not as good as the 3D.  I have watched both and the gap between the two is significant.  If you want to watch this film, beg, borrow, or go to a neighbor's to see it in 3D.  It is almost like watching a different film. The music is extraordinary. The feeling of being there in the audience is so greatly enhanced.  Flatley's onscreen time is diminished, but his dance ensemble is truly superior.  If I could have one wish, I would ask that the special effects were not so pronounced.  They distract from the dancing.  But, all in all, a wonderful experience.",1351987200,,725,4.480916030534351

You really get to see the whole performance not just close up cut aways.  The 3d really brings out patterns of the dancing possibly more than seeing it live.  And at $14 it is a steel for both performance Blu Ray or 3d Blu Ray.  And you get both.",1339977600,,398,4.197368421052632
4463918,4,B004SKQAJI,"This dance show has a storyline that will occasionally have you going, ""What the -- ?""  If you go in hoping for Riverdance Part 2, well, you kinda get that but under unusual circumstances.  Apparently, the Lord of the Dance (Michael Flatley, who even wears a belt that says he is) is out to conquer the evil forces that descend upon Planet Ireland.  No, don't ask.

The evil is represented by a masked leader ans his dozen soldiers dressed in something between Rollerball outfits and riot gear uniforms.  They may try to appear terrifying, but it is hard to fear these stormtroopers when they do an Irish jig.  Often when they are on stage, the background projection shows a devil's head or a death skull.  It is a bizarre show concept for family viewing.

I am not saying the show is not without its entertainment.  Michael Flatley is past his prime, but he is still an exceptional dancer.  That is, when he isn't trying to milk applause from the audience.  The rest of the cast are very good, including almost  twenty attractive female dancers who look exceptionally sexy in 3D.

(By the way, if you are a guy whose girlfriend is making you watch this video, practice now to keep a non-excited look when you get to 33:47; otherwise, you will suddenly sit up and cry out, ""Yes!! Thank you, Michael Flatley!!"")

The 3D runs the gamut from very good to extraordinary (at one point, you can count the bangles on a jester's hat).  The black areas of the screen never achieve a respectable full darkness, but there is enough good 3D to make up for that.  (This stage show was filmed in high def 3D cameras.)

Audio is good, not exceptional.

Though the extras are minimal (a ""making of""), I give this extra points because there are four deleted scenes from the film, all in 3D.",1339113600,5,1773,4.539432176656152

If I had a preview of this latest version, I wouldn't have bought it. I can't believe this was the show they took to THE POINT!
The dancing, and Michael was great, as usual..but the background 'scenery' was HORRIBLE. The flashing lights and colors blending in with the costume colors made it difficult to see the dancers, and the lights were hard on the eyes.
The costumes have not lived up to FOF either.  I disliked the bad guys costumes, especially, and missed the bare chest, beautiful short jackets previously worn by Michael.
If I were to suggest one of the shows for a new viewer, it would have to be Hyde Park FOF.  THe backgrounds evoked the mood of the scene and were clever and beautiful! The lighting and costumes were lovely. Why settle for second or third best with this version?

I must have misunderstood the description. I expected a different concert from Hyde Park.

This was simply the same concert done on a much smaller, cheaper scale. I thought Flatley, being a great choreographer, could have done something new.

4463930,4,B004SKQAJI,Michael Flatley gives his audiences a non stop rush of dancing and music.  It is great entertainment and a very nice way to spend an evening with a date or alone.,1314835200,,162,4.225806451612903
4463931,5,B004SKQAJI,This dvd was amazing!!!!! You won't ever see that performance again for a long time. The ordering was fast and delivery was even faster.,1314748800,,136,4.708333333333333
4463932,5,B004SKQAJI,"Fabulous.  It's hard to believe how awesome this man is.  This is my favorite version of LOTD.  He cut out the singing, kept the violins, and jams hard on his flute.  Bernadette Flynn playing Saoirse, the Irish Coleen is wonderful as usual (I miss her long hair, though), but I do prefer Gillian Norris over Ciara Sexton as Morrighan, the Temptress (possibly the long hair thing again...). I have seen the show live 3 times, watched the videos (river, LOTD, and flames) hundreds of times, and am very happy to have this new material.  The songs are played a touch faster, and the more demanding speed of the steps is perfectly executed with every tap.  Buy it now, and enjoy!  Thank you Michael, you are the greatest.",1314662400,4,717,4.5984251968503935
4463933,2,B004SKQAJI,I feel like each time Michael Flatley redoes a show it gets worse and worse and this one has proved the worst.  He made it too much about himself.  The new scenery was a little too much for a dancing show.  It felt more like a heavy metal concert.  The only good part is that Michael Flatley didn't take off his shirt....for once.,1313625600,5,330,4.190476190476191
4463934,2,B004SKQAJI,"Compared to the original Lord of the Dance video this one has background scenery on the stage that is very distracting.  It is sometimes hard to see the actual performances.  And there are very few close ups of the performers faces.  And because of the years that have elapsed since the original video came out, Michael Flatley has lost quite a bit of that world class athleticism he used to have.  Remember those 180 degree leg kicks he used to have?  Sadly, they are gone.  From now on I will only watch the original video.  After all, it's one the best videos ever made; in my opinion.",1313539200,4,588,4.4392523364485985
4463935,1,B004SKQAJI,"What I wanted was a Blu-Ray copy of Feet of Flames. What I found was a new cut of several Lord of the Dance performances. Its just not the same. Michael is of course awesome, but Feet of Flames was realy the definitive production.  Sad Face !",1312675200,2,242,4.148936170212766
4463936,5,B004SKQAJI,"This is Lord of the Dance as it was intended, in my opinion. The editing and sound are superb and the cast and costuming were excellent! The only thing (minor) that I didn't care for is that the beautiful singing pieces and my favorite routine, Siamsa, were cut from the running production but are included as bonus clips. The documentary included was also done well and was very insightful! Highly recommended!!",1312243200,2,412,4.816901408450704
4463937,2,B004SKQAJI,"While I love Michael Flatley, I found that this DVD was almost identical to the original ""Lord of the Dance"".....It's entertaining, as was the original, but nothing really new....",1312243200,2,179,5.206896551724138
4463938,4,B004SKQAJI,"To start off M.F. is up to his high standard of dance.  He is totally rocking it once again!  I have the original Lord of The Dance on VHS and the Feet of Flames.  Sorry but Feet of Flames is the best out of the three it gets a 5 star! This newest production would have been awesome to watch if it wasn't for some of the camera angles and way too many cut a-ways at very integral moments in the dances.  The slow motion shots are really annoying. It also seems to me that this is not just one show that was shot.  If you watch closely you will see Bernadette Flynn on the stage left then all of sudden she is stage right before coming to dance in the middle. Also on the ""Planet Ireland"" performance she seems to be missing in some shots then back again.  As I was watching it all the way to the end I was wondering where the ""Siamsa"" number was.  I found out it is a DELETED SCENE!  Why?!  It is one of my favorite parts.  For those who have never seen one of the Lord of the Dance productions it is a really good start. I encourage though to get the older ones too.  Guess I have been spoiled with the previous ones.",1310342400,56,1118,3.990990990990991
4463939,4,B004SKQAJI,"It's impossible to review this video without referencing the original production of 20 years ago. I have watched that video many times, and have seen it live three times (once with Flatley, twice without); needless to say, I'm a fan. There is no doubt that the audio and video on this disk are both spectacular. And Michael Flatley certainly still has ""the chops"" to pull off the dancing; in fact virtually the entire company is flawless. Then why only four stars?  The new production. There is soo much flash from the lighting effects, it's sometimes difficult to see the dancing.  The costumes are also a bit strange (especially for the men) and, as with the lighting, distract from the dancing.  Also, three scenes were cut from the main production (the two soprano solos and the ""Siamsa"" dance routine).  These ARE included in a ""deleated scenes"" section, but I don't know why they were cut in the first place.  Bottom line: I'm sure that I will watch this many times in the future - but if they ever release a remastered Blu-ray version of the original, it will be my hands-down favorite.",1310256000,28,1093,4.701570680628272

8439903,4,B004SKQAJI,I love this video.  I can't get over the talent and coordination these people have.  They have to practice hours a day ever day to be this good.  Michael Flatley hasn't lost a step in the last fifteen years when he made the original Lord of the Dance.  He is as good as always has been.,1487808000,,286,4.053571428571429
