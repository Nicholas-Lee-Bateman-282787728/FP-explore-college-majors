8429710,4,B004HV1NMM,"This DVD combined, for most of the models, not only their video performance, but still pictures taken at the same time.  Sometimes on split screen, and other times separately.  With the photos, and some of them were in Black and White, one got a good idea of how the play of light and shadow added so much to the result.  A couple of quibbles, however.  Since one uses a soundtrack, was it really necessary to have the sound (thunk) of the strobe recycling to be present?  That was distracting, as it was loud, and sometimes louder than the soundtrack.",1521763200,,552,4.5353535353535355
