6471359,5,B00L5R5LL0,"Great documentary. To sum it up, it reinstates what we already know. Eat a Paleo based diet(Meats, Vegetables, Eggs, Nuts & Fruits - AKA NATURAL FOODS that God gave us) and you and your family will live healthier, have more energy, be more productive and look better than ever. Forget about the diet fads and stop buying boxed/canned products. Of course, like everything, reprogramming your brain to enjoy home cooked meals without added sugars (which are 8x more addicting than cocaine as stated in the movie) is not an easy task, but not only I but many others have done it and no one regrets it today.

Very good explanation on how the food lobbying works. Highly recommended.",1410048000,5,679,4.754237288135593

6471361,5,B00L5R5LL0,"This movie does not need another five star review because if you've read the others you will know that it's well worth watching.  I would just like to add that if you want more detail about the biochemistry/physiologic imbalance that sugar causes you may also enjoy ""Sugar the Bitter Truth"" free on You Tube.  It has more detail about insulin and leptin resistance and how fructose, specifically, has a different metabolic pathway than glucose.  With that being said, this was an excellent, well-rounded movie for general audiences that offers realistic and practical solutions.  Every family and school should show this video and the general public should consider letting government know that our families' health is too important to let private interests dictate public health.",1409788800,10,780,5.266129032258065

6471431,5,B00L5R5LL0,"Don't listen to the less-than-complimentary reviews.  I found a 1-star ""review"" by a sugar industry person.  There's a reason they don't want you to watch this--and that's exactly why you should.

This documentary led me to conclusions that I'd not reached before: 1) Unequivocally, sugar makes us eat more, and the food industry knows that and uses it, loading our food with it unnecessarily and destroying our health; 2)  Low fat food is a useless lie that does nothing but line the pockets of the food industry.  3) The whole ""eat less, exercise more"" approach to weight loss is a fallacy promulgated by the food industry to convince people that weight gain is their own fault instead of the food industry's.

There's more, but those

I cleaned out the pantry, throwing away all of the crap I'd had no idea was crap.  Then I made dinner for my family tonight with no added sugar in it, and they loved it.  I also told them about the movie, and we're going to watch it together in a couple of days.

I'm so, so glad I watched this.  I'm done with sugar.  Done.  I know that's going to be hard, but I'll do whatever it takes.  It's that important.",1521331200,3,1148,4.483091787439614

6471438,1,B00L5R5LL0,"I viewed the movie and found it absurd on many levels. When and where I grew up, food was rationed, and cars and power tools and appliances were a luxury, so we seldom ate meat, and much energy was exerted on simple tasks.  ( I am a recent immigrant from a country which reverted to stone age by germans and kept there by soviets.) Although meat was scarce, sugary products including soda beverages, fruits, vegetables, and grains were mostly available, and my dietary choices were abysmal. Just like a kid presented in the movie, I would choose a candy over a vegetable 100% of time. Somehow I and my countrymen grew and remained thin. The movie criticizes fats and sugars, but does not present much science and research. They do the opposite to e.g. Dr. Michael Greger and his NutritionFacts: instead of presenting objective nutrition facts, they focused on society, politics, and economy at play,  and tried to reinvent the wheel e.g. Weighting the freedom of choice versus the benefit of society. One interesting moment comes in the movie when a school cafeteria cook complains that very few kids chose the healthy meal, which became available to them, after an incredible political struggle, involving Mr. President and his wife, which doesn't prevent the movie makers to focus on the latter. I believe in science and facts, and I can imagine some viewers may perceive the movie as a propaganda, and that doesn't help the cause. Sadly, the conclusions they arrived were simply wrong. E.g. one of the closing statements was: ""cook at home."" I knew many people in the U.S. who cook very unhealthy meals at home. Not because they intend to harm themselves, they simply do not have the right information. Knowledge is power, and this movie does too little to bring it to people.",1511049600,,1779,4.810457516339869

This is the kind of information that everyone needs - sugar is toxic. Where they started to lose me was when it became political, basically stating how Republicans screwed it up and the Democrats have been working hard to fix it. The bias was very apparent. The solution that the documentary believes in is establishing mandates and controlling what kids eat and see. They do not believe the responsibility lies on adults (parents) to be informed and make better decisions, and that I disagree with it. Despite those two factors, the message was still there and had information I had not found yet.",1493683200,4,749,4.7251908396946565

I knew what this doc. was about, but I was still shocked when I realized how the public has been lied to by the big food corporations, most of them in collusion with lobbyists in Washington. It's despicable! We are all responsible for what we put in our mouth, but the relentless advertising to children of sugary foods and drinks  , and the notion that junk food is fun because you get a small, worthless toy with your ""happy"" meal is disgusting. Junk food companies now populate the cafeterias of our public schools, with very little healthy options available. Kids at 12 are developing adult diabetes. Children as young as ten are in need of gastric bypass surgery. Watch this video, it may help you to become a healthier person.",1492560000,2,837,4.732876712328767

6471574,5,B00L5R5LL0,"This documentary hits the nail on the head: the food industry targets everyone, but especially children, who are the most vulnerable.  The solution is simple, theoretically: stop eating processed foods. But implementing this change can be borderline impossible, especially when children are being fed garbage for lunch at school.

This documentary could have emphasized a couple more points, namely 1) that while processed foods are not always cheaper, the time saved is quite alluring for Americans especially, who are increasingly overworked as wages fail to keep up with inflation and the increasing cost of living; and 2) that the problem of sugar addiction is part of a much larger problem of addition in the U.S. The U.S. is, after all, one of only two countries (the other being New Zealand) that allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs (and they say there's a ""war"" on drugs). The fact of the matter is, most Americans are quite firmly addicted to something, be it food or drugs or tobacco or alcohol.  This problem is larger than the scope of this documentary, of course, but it could have been discussed if only briefly.

Moreover, we're never going to get past these problems until we get over the largest addiction of them all: money. Unfortunately, we as Americans have this psychological complex that venerates and even fetishizes wealth and financial success so much that ""we can't pass this regulation until we know how it's going to affect industry ____"" is a nonsensical argument that is almost taken as a given in political discourse. We will at some point have to decide when enough is enough: When will we decide that, you know what, yeah tough new laws probably would put a lot of these sugar industry people out of a job.  But if the existence of your wealth is predicated on the exploitation of the general population, if it depends on preying upon children and making addicts and illness out of people, well you can just cry me a river. Enough is enough. We have to have the balls to say no, not all profits are good, and greed is bad. We have to prioritize. And when it comes to living in this world, money comes and goes, people come and go, but your health is what sticks with you, for better or for worse. It's what you should be able to fall back on through life's struggles.  It's what should allow you to bounce back, get back on your feet, or even reinvent yourself. But we're allowing greed to destroy this most basic of assets: the finely honed instrument that is your body.  Enough is enough!",1487462400,2,2548,4.751131221719457

6471609,3,B00L5R5LL0,"I think this documentary was good regarding fast and processed foods.  I think our bodies do not recognize all the man made chemicals as foods and some people's livers have a harder time and thus, they gain weight easier.  I was surprised that Bill Clinton did not say how he lost his extra weight becoming a vegan (although I think he eats some eggs now).  My own weight loss has occurred by not eating meat (or very little) as well as avoiding dairy.  I also eat no gluten or processed foods (except gf bread once in a while).  I eat lots of fruits and salads and prefer them to any chips or cookies.  You can change your psychology towards food when you realize you feel so much better.  I don't think it's just sugar causing the problem though.  It was sad to see that beautiful boy have gastric bypass surgery.  That should be against the law.  In fact, my cousin went blind because of that surgery.  I know I could help both those young people lose lots of weight and still have natural sweet and pleasurable food.  However, I am sure the beef industry would not like it.  Remember what happened to Oprah.",1484006400,,1111,4.413793103448276

6471615,5,B00L5R5LL0,Fed Up is an eye opening movie that really shows why there is such a big problem with obesity in America. It starts out by telling the viewer that it is not always the persons fault. Which in my view is most important because it takes some of the blame away from the person and puts some responsibility on the big food companies. It was also enjoyable because it not only told us that obesity is a big problem but it supported its thoughts with data and research. The movie showed that a lot of food companies are trying harder and harder to trick their customers into unhealthy food by advertising reduced fats and low calories when it really doesn't help people become healthier. They are doing this because if the consumer stops eating the foods then the companies will go out of business.
