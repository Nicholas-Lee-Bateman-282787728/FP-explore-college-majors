It's great exercise for her and it allows me to get dinner cooked. When I have a house full of toddlers and we hit a rut, it's great to get them back into happy mode and gives me a small break too.",1162512000,,354,3.9305555555555554
2253315,5,B0007Z0O86,"We had this in the car DVD player on a really long road-trip, and our 3-year-old couldn't get enough of it!  She was sitting in her carseat doing the arm motions, and then when she watched it at home, she REALLY got into all the movements.  And she still goes around singing the catchy tunes all the time; plus, she learned some things about animals that she didn't know before.  While I'm not crazy about a lot of tv/dvd-watching, this DVD is definitely one to have in your collection without feeling too much parental guilt!",1149033600,,526,4.515789473684211
2253316,5,B0007Z0O86,"My 2&1/2 year old daughter loves this dvd.  We acted out some of the songs and dances and she thought it was the best.  Once it ended, she just kept on saying ""again, again"" until I played it again.  We brought it our to the sitters that day and as soon as we put it on, she started dancing around.  Very cute digital monkey characters, very interactive adult character and easy to learn fun songs and dances.",1123027200,,409,4.2727272727272725
8054353,5,B0007Z0O86,"My 18 month old and 3 yo daughters absolutely LOVE this DVD! It's very cute, very catchy, educational and fun! They jump up and down in excitement when it comes on. The songs are super catchy- I find myself randomly singing them throughout the day! Would definitely recommend this video!",1422489600,,287,4.76
8054354,5,B0007Z0O86,We watch this DVD several times a day.  The kids have so much fun wiggling and following the instructions.  It tires them out! I may have to get another copy for the winter.,1287705600,,173,4.212121212121212
8054355,5,B0007Z0O86,THIS IS MY 2 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTERS FAVORITE VIDEO OF ALL TIME!  THEY REQUEST TO WATCH IT EVERYDAY...THEY LOVE TO SING AND DANCE WITH THE MONKEYDOOS...IT IS ALSO EDUCATIONAL. MY 3 1/2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON ALSO LOVES IT!  I WISH THERE WERE MORE TO PICK FROM!,1286928000,,255,4.521739130434782
8054356,4,B0007Z0O86,"This video is beautiful in its simplicity. A few simple animated monkeys, children (this is what I think has my son hooked), and host Maureen (who looks the part of the really fun babysitter, very young herself), sing and dance to tunes such as ""Tiger Paws, Hummingbird, Elephant Shuffle,"" and ""To Catch a Crocodile."" The songs are infectious and you will learn the words within the first three views of this video. They will quickly drive you nuts, but my son still relentlessly begs for us to put this video on for him. Though he is only 18 months, he has learned the ""dance"" moves and it holds his interest. Catchy, short (approx 20 minutes total run-time?), simple... I give a 4 star rating-- one star reduction for the mild annoyance factor (as with most children's music).

Based on his incredible interest in this video, we have opted to order Potty Power, which is produced by the same company, in the hopes that he will be equally as interested in that video.

*On a separate note unrelated to the video's content (not affecting star rating), it arrived $.70 postage due at my house. Since my time is simply not worth going after $.70, I did not try to go after it from the retailer (who is not Amazon). Still, if I pay shipping costs for something, I should not have to pay my postal carrier again at delivery!*",1285718400,,1321,4.546218487394958
8054357,4,B0007Z0O86,"My children love the monkeydoos. We've seen it on tv before and the ideas are funny, the tunes catchy. The reason why I didn't give it a five star review was my big disappointment, when only one disc arrived instead of the pictured 2. Yes, I guess I should have read where it says only one disc, but given the picture I assumed that this was the product listing for both movies. If I would have known that, I would have bought both movies (along with 3 other educational movies) for only 4 dollars more on an auction site instead.",1275350400,,530,4.31
8054358,5,B0007Z0O86,This is my 2 year olds favorite. I can do anything I want for 30 minutes as long as I put this in. Highly recommended.,1247011200,,118,3.76
8054359,5,B0007Z0O86,"This is excellent DVD for the kids. We borrowed ""Monkeydoos: Gallop, Hop and Stomp"" DVD from the library and my kids (ages 4 & 6) really loved it! Singing along with the screen and stomping, jumping, and roaring following the motions!

It was so good that we decided to buy it, but we could not find it anywhere. Then I realized that ""Gallop, Hop and Stomp"" has been renamed as ""Monkeydoos: Go, Go Animals!""

I do not know why they changed the name, but I was glad that the DVD was available. Same content, same songs, and same fun!

DVD is about 28 minutes total, but full of fun for the kids! Your little ones will enjoy it! Highly recommended!",1245369600,3,646,4.366666666666666
8054360,4,B0007Z0O86,Bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help motivate her into moving..... did it's trick.  My daughter was up hopping around with the DVD.,1226793600,,141,4.423076923076923
8054361,5,B0007Z0O86,"This video is pretty cute.  My son is only 18 months so he doesn't get up and move with it yet but it keeps him entertained.  I hope he continues to like it so that in the future it will be a fun video to pull out when you're stuck inside and need some activity to get the ""snarkys"" out.  :)",1175126400,,291,3.737704918032787
8054362,5,B0007Z0O86,"My daughter loves this.  Just wish I could get more of them.  It's a fun video with music, movement and animals.  I don't even mind it.  It's also a great break from more of the same shows available every day.",1169251200,,209,4.15
