8083897,2,B000B9ECH2,"My perspective is that of what I suppose might be called an intermediate student -- about 5 years of regular practice under two fine teachers, both of whom studied in China and one of whom has won national competitions. I own several Yang style DVDs -- all useful in different ways. I learned the basic choreography of one short Chen form from a real master, and have practiced it off and on for about a year.  I was eager to find an instructional DVD on Chen style for use as a practice guide and reference.

This isn't that DVD. I'm not remotely competent to evaluate grandmaster Cheng's skill, but it's obvious that it's of a very high order.  For an advanced student wishing a model for this particular Chen routine (USA competition form), this book may be fine.  For beginners and for someone like me with a few years tai chi experience (already having received some basic instruction in about 2/3 of the postures demonstrated) it's almost useless.  There are two main flaws:

  1) The DVD has no menu and no tracks. To navigate, you have to fast-forward or move back, as if you were using a VHS.  That is, the developer simply ignored every technical advantage of the DVD medium.

  2) The demonstrations of individual moves (after you've gone to the trouble to find them) are good, but the narration is terrible.  Much of it consists of ""inhale...exhale"" -- repeated dozens of times.  The rest is mostly what anyone could see by watching, e.g., ""turn left...kick...punch.""  They're essentially the oral equivalent of photo captions, not instructional guidance. (I can see that a kick is a kick.  What I'd like help on is how to do it properly.)

  Grandmaster Cheng has a number of Chen-style DVDs on sale. Maybe they're excellent, but I won't risk $39+ to find out.  I might feel differently if I considered myself expert in one of the specific forms he teaches and simply wanted to watch how he does it.  It's too bad.  This appears to be a case of a world-class expert -- someone who fully deserves honor for his skill level -- making no effort whatsoever to make his teaching accessible.",1143676800,4,2098,4.644021739130435
