8208470,4,B000TAPCBI,"Vintage Lee Van Cleef acted out his parts well. I always like these type of Westerns, they never date, but then I grew up on them. The stories always have the same theme but, coupled to the acting and stunning western scenery, they always capture me.

Having been fortunate enough to visit the scenery in Spain at ""Cinema Studios Fort Bravo"", (""Texas Hollywood"") in the Desert of Tabernas, Almeria Spain (the only desert in Europe), and Andaluca, Spain doubling for the US in Arizona, New Mexico and California, the films give me added pleasure. Hope they go on remaking them so as to benefit from the new technology.

I enjoyed these films which I saw on television, but I did see them originally at the cinema long before DVD's or Videos were in existence.",1387411200,,758,4.649253731343284

8208474,3,B000TAPCBI,"Lee Van Cleef (1/9/25--12/16/89) began his acting career on Broadway (including a minor part in the original MR. ROBERTS). Lee's first film role was a heavy in the 1952 classic, HIGH NOON (with Gary Cooper). Typecast as a ""bad guy"" almost from the beginning, Van Cleef appeared over the next 30 years in dozens of American and European-made westerns.

Among the nine films in the LEE VAN CLEEF COLLECTION are his last screen appearance and a sample of a short-lived TV series in which Lee played an aging ninja master.
