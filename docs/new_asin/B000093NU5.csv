7989523,5,B000093NU5,"I heard about Pop a long time ago. About three years ago, so when I heard it was finally coming to DVD I was very exited. So, I recently got my copy of the DVD in the mail and it was great. The main reason I wanted to see this film is because of Elisa Donovan. I am a huge fan of her work, and it is great to see her in a different role. She usually plays rich, snobbish characters (clueless, A Night at the Roxbury, Clueless series), but in this film she plays a nice, down to earth character. Her acting in this film is great. Peter Paige is very good, as well. The DVD has pretty good features, but the movie is the main reason to buy it. It is a very funny, smart movie. It shouldn't be taken too seriously, though. I would reccommend this film to anyone looking for a great movie. And it is good for almost all ages, but there is a little bit of profanity. The DVD features include: Trailer, Commentary, a little documentary about the making of pop, and an interview with the man who did the score for Pop, Guy Baker. This movie also has great music Guy Baker did an amazing job. The directing is great, as well. Brian Johnson did a great job. I think IndieDVD is a great company, I will look for more of their films.
