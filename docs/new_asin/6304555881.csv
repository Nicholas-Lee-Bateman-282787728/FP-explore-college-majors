I gave this video a shot.  As mentioned below, the sound is very poor and the narrator is so monotone that I fell asleep.  It covered most of the areas that I wanted to see around Prague (that's why I give two stars) but the video quality looked like it was taken by a tourist with a basic camcorder.  It wasn't done as well as some of the Lonely Planet shows, which was more of the the type of video I was looking for.  If you don't mind getting a video that isn't exclusively on Prague, I'd suggest Eastern Cities Travel the World: Prague, Budapest and Istanbul with Rick Steeves.  With very few videos on Prague available, that one takes the cake, not this one.",973555200,13,861,4.316770186335404
7874868,1,6304555881,"It is not only the sound track that is poor.  There is too much distortion to watch this video.  This video is a total disappointment.  This earns one star because I can't enter my comment without it.  Try ""Super  Cities Prague."" The quailty of ""Super Cities Prague"" is much  better.",940464000,12,283,4.56
