8185989,1,B000OPO4QW,"should have been the title for this train wreck. NOT in any form or fashion should this cross between Ed Wood and Michael Moore be considered a documentary. It is instead simply an excuse for a group of ignorant untalented
and at times criminally stupid people to take a road trip and get paid for it.

A couple of items:
1) Riding motorcycle with dog in backpack. Even a minor accident would have resulted in injury or death for this poor puppy.
2) Mixing hazardous chemicals to make ""cool fuel"" Hempoline for their RV and NOT being able to tell 3.5 grams from 35 grams.( which at best was unusable and at worst could have killed someone) This is a better alternative to fossil fuels?
3) In one episode the idiot 'star' manages to get himself lost and spends the night in woods. LOST?! How the heck can the be so stupid as to get lost with a map and GPS? Ah, but wait. These are the same geniuses who couldn't figure out to call ahead and find out if their next 'fueling' stop even existed!  I've seen better pre-planning among first graders queuing up for potty breaks.

This series does NOT promote anything other than the idiots who produced and starred in it. It does NOT show alternate energy as viable alternatives to fossil fuel. I was hoping to use this in my classes as a teaching aid. The only thing this would teach my students is:
1: Aussies are idiots (not true, but you couldn't prove it with this mess)
2: Alternate energy is a joke. (I wonder if these guys actually work for BP or Exxon?)",1186358400,,1505,4.387096774193548
