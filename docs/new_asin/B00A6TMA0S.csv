5384831,5,B00A6TMA0S,So happy that this documentary was made. I've watched it twice already and plan on watching it again. LOVED it as a time capsule of nostalgia from a wonderful time in the 80s. The reunion footage is both exciting and touching. Excellent production and continuity!,1370217600,4,263,4.866666666666666
5384832,5,B00A6TMA0S,"The quick delivery allowed me to totally surprise my friend before their birthday. Having participated in the documentary, I couldn't resist getting one for myself since the price was too good to pass up.",1370044800,2,204,5.029411764705882
5384833,3,B00A6TMA0S,"Not captioned! For those who are hearing impaired, you should forget about buying this unless you purchase it solely for the visual memories it brings up. If this was somehow captioned I think it would have been great.",1368921600,,218,4.7631578947368425
5384834,4,B00A6TMA0S,"I may not necessarily recommend this doc to people who had no recollection of the show (unless you are a fan of 80s pop culture or pro wrestling in general), but then again I watched it with someone who wasn't even born when it was on the air and she thought it was great.

As someone who watched every Saturday morning on WPIX New York in syndication, I thought this is a well-done film that gives fans a fun glimpse into what it took to produce the show and how hard the talent worked to make it a success.  Special thanks to the stars and the filmmakers in case they read this.",1366848000,5,580,4.169642857142857
5384835,4,B00A6TMA0S,"GLOW tells the story of the first all-female wrestling company, which is entertaining and fun. Recommended for all wrestling fans.",1366243200,2,130,5.55
5384836,5,B00A6TMA0S,"I loved this show as a kid. Campy as hell, though I didn't recognize that so much at the time. Loved the characters. Great to see what the gals are up to now. This was a great tribute. Unfortunate that the full seasons of episodes aren't available affordably, though after watching the doc I understand why. The extras are plentiful and really made this a treat.",1365638400,2,362,4.5
5384837,4,B00A6TMA0S,This DVD was disappointing in some ways but fascinating in others. I had watched this show when I was much younger and enjoyed it. It was campy but funny and some of the girls were definitely good looking. I knew from the description that this was a documentary about the show and the girls. I was however expecting to see some footage of old matches. No dice on the matches but the documentary was well done and it was nice to see what some of the women are up to today and how they look as well as their memories of the show. I'd say rent this instead of buy it if you can. It's worth a viewing but probably not much repeat viewing.,1364947200,2,634,4.120967741935484
5384838,2,B00A6TMA0S,"I really was disappointed with this. I watched it to find out who these girls were in real life, where they had come from and where they had been since GLOW had ended. There was very little of this. They didn't even use their real names, instead introducing them by their character's name. They didn't say anything about their personal lives, are they married? Do they have children? They don't even make mention of some of the stars at all. Where was Spanish Red? They even gloss over why the show was canceled, alluding to a rumor that the financial backer who was married to Pia Zadora was ordered by her to end the show because he was having sex with the girls, but they do not delve into it at all! This should have been so much better. It leaves more questions than answers.",1363651200,5,780,4.386206896551724
5384839,5,B00A6TMA0S,"I could watch this documentary over & over again! The women shared a true sisterhood while appearing to despise one another on film.
If you are the type that is moved by a ""real"" story involving sports, comedy, drama, suspense and action, you will be glad you purchased this DVD & eagerly recommend it to your friends just as I have!",1357257600,8,333,4.475409836065574
5384840,5,B00A6TMA0S,"Even tho the gimmicks were like, comic book characters the show is really fun. And with the divas revolution I cam definitely see this happening again. Ya know what I'm saying?",1443052800,,176,4.709677419354839
5384841,5,B00A6TMA0S,"Well told story about a very special show. Tons of interviews, Touching and uplifting.",1438214400,,86,5.214285714285714
5384842,5,B00A6TMA0S,Great documentary on GLOW Wrestling. Very informative and maybe one of the few documentaries done on female wrestlers today.,1436659200,,124,5.578947368421052
5384843,4,B00A6TMA0S,"Great background info on the organization and all the female talent! I could have done without the seemingly endless footage of Susie Spirit tearing up her elbow. I almost lost my lunch! The singing videos brought back pleasant memories of  the original TV run, tho. Also, the comedy skits reminiscent of Hee Haw & Laugh In.",1425254400,2,324,4.785714285714286

5384846,5,B00A6TMA0S,"I was so excited when I heard about this documentary. I really enjoyed this show as a young boy, but none of my friends seem to know what I was talking about.

It's pretty cool to see them reflecting on the show 20+ years later.",1422144000,,228,4.066666666666666

5384849,5,B00A6TMA0S,"What can I say GLOW, chainsaw, dementia, some of my all time favorite female wrestlers, I remember watching this late at night when my parents were sleeping. The skits and the high shorts were too funny from back in the day... I really miss stuff like this.",1396396800,4,257,4.48936170212766

5384851,5,B00A6TMA0S,"This is the best documentary I have ever seen!  The stories of these women and there legendary strength of them is so awesome and the movie itself is so professionally done.  There should be a movie made as well as to their GLOW stories and on the road tours they did, it would be even better!  GIRLS ROCK AND THEY WRESTLE TOO!!!  What a flash back to the late 80's!!!  O:)",1394150400,3,373,4.197183098591549
5384852,5,B00A6TMA0S,Growing up as a wrestling fan G.L.O.W was a very important show that I used to watch.  Loving the storylines and beauty of the women was amazing.  To watch a product that offered better women's wrestling than WWF/WWE was unheard of.,1391990400,2,232,4.634146341463414
5384853,5,B00A6TMA0S,"Everyone should watch this. While it's completely ridiculous, the wrestlers are mostly self-aware of the camp. Great story, heart-warmer. Highly recommend",1388966400,,154,6.380952380952381
5384854,5,B00A6TMA0S,Having grown up watching GLOW as a child I loved this documentary.  It's very well made and centers around Mt. Fiji for the most part.  It's really great in running down the history with lots of interviews.  There's clips of the bouts also.  My girlfriend watched this with me and she had zero connection to GLOW or wrestling at all going in and really enjoyed it too.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's a fun watch.,1382486400,2,417,4.421052631578948
5384855,5,B00A6TMA0S,"I used to love watching this growing up. Hearing the stories, seeing all the bonus features and watching the reunion brought back SO many memories. Love this documentary.",1380758400,2,170,5.107142857142857
5384856,5,B00A6TMA0S,"This is a GREAT documentary! A real snapshot into the early days of modern wrestling/entertainment. It covers the concept, formation, public face and finances of GLOW, and catches up with several of the women today.... All at once, it's fun, nostalgic, and (sometimes) heartbreaking. If you dug the late-70's/80's indie scene, and the very beginnings of WWF's rise, and especially if you were a Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling fan, you'll definitely dig this doc!",1375747200,4,460,5.22972972972973
5384857,3,B00A6TMA0S,"The film was good at tracing the problems, successes and history of the organization.  I liked the reunion the ladies had.  It was very touching.  It could have been better if the two men who put GLOW together agreed to sit down for an interview.  I would only recommend the movie to wrestling fans.",1373414400,2,299,4.481481481481482
5384858,3,B00A6TMA0S,It wasn't quite the hype I was looking for.  The video isn't as great as some of the wrestling videos thats for sure.,1372982400,,117,4.086956521739131
5384859,5,B00A6TMA0S,I saw the movie and it tells about the girls during the years of wrestling and what there doing now. Some of them have hit hard times and some have become successful lives afterwards.,1371945600,2,183,4.411764705882353
8547131,5,B00A6TMA0S,"Excellent and fascinating. I am not a wrestling fan and I know very little about it or about GLOW. I never watched it never was interested until now. GLOW was burlesque on Sunday afternoon TV. All of these performers are charming and unique. it truly is sad that the plug was pulled on this show. I found myself getting teary eyed as these ladies educated me on what I missed out on. Some were real wrestlers, but some were just kids. All are fascinating. Crazy characters and crazier costumes. All lots of fun. Worth sticking with to the very end. I wish it were an hour longer.",1504742400,,579,4.420560747663552
8547132,4,B00A6TMA0S,The video was great but it took longer than listed to arrive.,1504483200,,61,4.166666666666667
8547133,5,B00A6TMA0S,Was worth watching.,1500336000,,19,5.666666666666667
8547134,5,B00A6TMA0S,A great look back at a really fun time. I loved the show as a kid and it was nice to see where some of the wrestlers are today.,1498694400,,127,3.413793103448276
8547135,4,B00A6TMA0S,"If you never watched the original, this video ill not have as much meaning for you.  It featured reminiscences of about 6 of the more popular wrestlers, how they got involved, how things were set up and how they progressed.  Stuff you did not see during the actual show but was very interesting.  Things like 2 of the most dangerous looking wrestlers also doubled as the 2 most (purposefully) incompetent wrestlers and actually knew nothing about wrestling.  It also touches on their careers after the show ended.  I found it well worth the time to ""catch-up"".",1495324800,,560,4.791666666666667
8547136,5,B00A6TMA0S,An compelling and comprehensive view at GLOW's four season run from the major players. You get well kept footage alongside current interviews with some of the wrestlers. Fascinating to see what happened to the 30+ women roster after the show was abruptly cancelled in 1990. A must for all GLOW fans!!,1485216000,,300,4.901960784313726
8547137,4,B00A6TMA0S,Great documentary that explored a world that I loved as a child.,1473724800,,64,4.416666666666667
8547138,4,B00A6TMA0S,An interesting documentary about the GLOW show in the 80's.,1464825600,,59,5.0
8547139,4,B00A6TMA0S,Loved the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.  A cute documentary.  Very interesting how they were housed and handled at a casino by the production company.,1460678400,,150,5.208333333333333
8547140,5,B00A6TMA0S,fully delightful if you watched the show ... mildly delightful if you didnt.,1444867200,,76,4.923076923076923
