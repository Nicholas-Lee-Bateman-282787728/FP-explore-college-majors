6750134,1,B00OGT2UFE,"The industry that gave us The Next Karate Kid, Home Alone 3, 4, & 5, Son of the Mask, Dumb & Dumberer and Evan Almighty might just have hit a new low in the category of belated movie sequels that have no ties to the original, most especially due to the absence of the stars that made those films worth milking in the first place.

Can we be expected to believe that Sinbad couldn't be signed on for this? I doubt very highly that he had prior commitments.

There is absolutely no reason in the world to pay money for this. In all likelyhood, it will be on Netflix within 48 hours of the DVD's release. But if you must pay, it is sure to be jam-packed into every Red Box kiosk this holiday season or you can wait and pay $3.50 for a used copy at your local goodwill store in January 2015.",1415059200,16,787,4.103896103896104

6750161,3,B00OGT2UFE,"Larry Phillips (Larry The Cable Guy) is a fun-loving laid-back father who works part-time & living out of a trailer with a daughter named Noel (Kennedi Clements) who's mother recently got remarried to Victor (Brian Stepanek) who is an owner of a boxing business & more financially set than Larry.  Victor is attempting to go all out for Christmas to buy the affection of Noel while Larry's efforts to one-up him always backfiring causing Larry to attempt to get the one gift that he thinks his daughter wants in the hottest selling holiday toy, The Harrison Bear, only for it to keep selling out before he could get one with Victor finding out about Larry's plans & using his influence to make sure he has the only one for her resulting in Larry & his best friend Claude (Santino Marella) stopping at nothing & getting into the different situations in attempts to get a Harrison Bear.

This is one of those sequels that has no ties to the original movie (starring Arnold Schwarzegger almost a decade ago) but is a similar plot in a parent going through many situations just to obtain the hottest selling Christmas toy of the year does tell an important message at the end about what really makes a child in this situation happy & how one's selfishness has more negative effects than expected but was still an entertaining & funny family movie overall.",1449273600,,1351,4.6722689075630255

Facing a losing battle a man tries to get his daughter the gift she wants for Christmas. Well, the rich pompous jerk step father buys all in town to stop him. A lot like that new movie that is coming out. A step dad and dad fighting over who is favorite. What a horrible message. Step dads are portrayed jerks in movies like this. Only reason I finished the movie is because I had nothing else to do and I was hoping for a happy ending where the step dad dies. Well naturally he lives, unfortunately. It loses a star for the horrible message.

As a movie, it is horribly acted, badly scripted, gross typical Larry the Cable Guy jokes, but is still slightly humorous and the story is Ok aside from the jerk. Good ending, kind of a coming of age moving. Anyone who gives this more than 3 stars is obviously a  paid review.",1448928000,,962,4.2228260869565215

6750207,3,B00OGT2UFE,"Sorry is this is scattered.  I got something from Amazon saying the first two could not be posted.

The movie is about a guy, whose daughter loves him very much.  But, him and her mother are divorced.  The lady has a new man in her life.  Each man feels that the other is trying to take his place.  One man sees a note to Santa that his daughter wrote.  He knows that if he gets her that toy, he will give her something the other man cannot.  The other man spies on the dad.  Then he tries to stop the man from getting the toy.

That is the movie.  Now, I did actually laugh at parts of it.  It was a dumb, childish type of humor.  But, eventually, it just gets old.  I mean, every time the man gets close to getting a toy, something stops him.  It is humorous at first, but it gets to the point in which they did not even try to write anything good.  It just gets to be some random thing that stops the man from getting the toy.  I started rolling my eyes after a bit.

Another thing, this movie seems to have a lot of filler moments like scenes with just a random action happening for a few minutes, like the girl and her moms new man playing with snowballs.  It just went on far to long.  There were a few scenes like this.  Kind of made me feel like this should have been an hour long TV special or something.

The end of the movie, at least with a couple of people, just happens so fast and all of a sudden that you feel like everything you have seen is pointless.  Something that the daughter does, that you see at then end.  I don't know, it didn't work.  How old is she supposed to be?  You get almost no time with her.  For such an important character, who the movie is built around, it is odd.  I do not want to say too much.  You will have to see.

On top of all that, the thing with the guy stopping the other man from getting the toy gets crazy.  I said already, that it gets old, but they want you to believe there is a highly limited toy and that they allow the first person to get all of them.  Would not happen.  Plus, there are other areas around.  Yet, one man gets all the toys.  How many places could this man get to, before the other man was able?  He would have to know exactly where the other man was going.

There is a part with a kid that will make you just sigh towards the end, when he is trying to get something from the dad.  I mean, come on, its just some of the unfunniest stuff I have ever heard.

The movie did make me laugh.  It is a mildly entertaining movie for the kids and maybe the mom and dad as well.  It is on cable now.  So, if you want to, check it out.

Oh, I actually don't think the acting is all that bad.  You have to know what type of movie you are watching.  It is just a made for TV movie that is for young kids.  I am 29 and I liked it.",1420243200,,2790,3.9017857142857144

I walked into the living room a couple days before Christmas and found my wife watching this on FX channel!  What the heck, Larry?!  You push your DVD knowing it's going to be on TV for free?!?!?  I wasn't too pleased with that.  Not only did I pay for something I could have seen for free on cable, but it also ruined my Christmas Eve plans as my wife already watched it.  Not cool.

6750240,5,B00OGT2UFE,"My first reactions were that I am not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, and I have the original Jingle All the Way. I feared that this might be just a remake of the original, but while there are some similarities, they are two distinct movies. And this goes beyond the gender of the child involved The central characters of the movie are the father who is a part time truck driver, and the stepfather who is a wealthy businessman. Both are vying for the affection of the daughter/stepdaughter, and the object is to find the one thing she wants most for Christmas. The father starts by taking her letter to Santa to be mailed, and he peeks to see what she wants. Due to poor penmanship and some questionable spelling (inherited from her father), the father takes off after the toy he thinks she wants, and the stepfather uses one of his spies to learn what the father is after. Then both men set off on a wild-goose chase and create much mayhem, and when everything has fallen apart, they learn the truth about what the girl really
wanted. I will leave it to viewers to find out what the girl really wanted and if she got her wish.

6750244,3,B00OGT2UFE,"Jingle All the Way 2 is nice, cute and funny movie, but the first Jingle All the Way film is better. This film is almost similar to the first movie. This film is about two dads. The first dad is a lazy, fun loving, outdoorsy, and part time truck driver dad (Larry the Cable Guy) and the other dad (Stepanek) is a stuck up, rich, arrogant, and a owner of a boxing company, so they hated each other. They think that their same daughter (Clements) wants a very popular teddy bear and it is sold out everywhere, so they went searching for the teddy bear for their daughter and the battle begins. In this film. Santino Marella is in it. I gave this film a 3 and half star rating.",1418169600,3,674,4.1923076923076925

6750248,2,B00OGT2UFE,"I watched it because I would watch a train wreak. A dad (Larry the Cable Guy) and a step-dad (Brian Stepanek) compete for the affection of Noel (Kennedi Clements). Dad does neat fun outdoors stuff, while step-dad has the money to buy anything. Dad wants to get Noel the Harrison bear, but step-dad has been preventing this by buying them all up. That's pretty much it. Nothing overly clever. Some slap stick humor. I thought the situation of competing dads with daughter caught in the middle a sad situation that was made into a comedy...a comedy that doesn't really work.

Fans of the Larry film series for kids might like this one too. I didn't think it too entertaining.",1417910400,,673,4.65546218487395

6750257,1,B00OGT2UFE,"This is awful.  No one in this movie can act, the story is the most cliche thing I have ever seen and it is painful to watch.  Please, PLEASE do not subject your kids to this abomination and go get the original instead.  I enjoyed the first Jingle all the Way when I was a kid and still have fond memories of it and I would easily recommend that instead of this disaster.
The only nice thing I can say is that Santino Marella (from the WWE) is the best actor in the movie and I commend him for doing his best.",1417651200,15,509,3.9705882352941178
6750258,4,B00OGT2UFE,"My 11 year old daughter said that this is better than seeing Larry the Cable Guy dressed up as a Tooth Fairy.  I liked this movie because you get to see Larry the Cable Guy acting like Larry the Cable Guy without perverse or sexual humor.  The little girl in the movie was a great child actor talent who seemed genuine and less Hollywood.  The big epic slapstick humor did not work for Robbin Williams in RV because Robin Williams was too sophisticated a comedian for that kind of humor but, in Jingle All the Way 2, the epic slap stick humor fits perfectly with Larry.  My daughter said she likes seeing the face of the voice of Mater and without a Tooth Fairy costume.  My wife and I enjoyed it because Larry does have natural comedic talent and we were able to enjoy him in a non-R-rated format.",1417564800,2,798,4.328859060402684

That's what happens here as Larry the Cable Guy hunts for a Harrison Bear in hopes of making Christmas special for his little girl.

Four stars for JATW2, as no film could top the five-star excellence of the first one.

 A great christmas comedy with 2 dads trying to win the love of the little girl and the result is a crazed christmas mayhem.
 My only complaint is the main male actors who played the dads should be more good looking so to have some chemistry with the mother of the child.
 romantic element was completely absent from the movie and that was a minus.
