8687034,2,B00P9E770I,I was disappointed in video. There were scenes of all the races but I would have also liked to have seen some interviews with the top 3 finishers after each race and/or the race teams to hear what the major issues were. There was no behind the scenes or after race discussions so I wouldn't recommend it.,1455753600,,304,4.350877192982456
