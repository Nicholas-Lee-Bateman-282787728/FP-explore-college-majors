8136571,4,B000H5TUMW,"This video amply demonstrates how integrated Rick Danko's abilities as an instrumentalist, were allied to his vocal concept as he often would sing along the lyric of one of the many famous songs that he performed as a member of The Band, whilst at the same time accompanying himself on the bass, sometimes with just one other musician,to convey how his bass-lines always shadowed and supported the melody of the song.
I have often heard it said that as there were three outstanding vocal talents in The Band who were all also instrumentalists, it explained how fully they each understood, from many years of working together, how best to accompany not only themselves but also each other-not just attributable to their own personal talents, but also of how much they were aware of what each other musician was contributing to the 'group' performance-and that is still the best reason to marvel at the work they produced together and also to demonstrate that the most important lesson to learn as a musician is to listen.
It this respect this video, whilst it may not concentrate too much on virtuosity and technical mastery of the instrument, does show Rick demonstrating many useful playing styles, and is in my opinion of great benefit to any aspiring bassist who wishes to glean some insight from a masterful performer and interpreter of popular song.",1311552000,5,1354,4.91703056768559
