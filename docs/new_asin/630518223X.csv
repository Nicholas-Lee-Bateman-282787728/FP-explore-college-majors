7884280,5,630518223X,"One of my favorite series from the 1960's, when Britain set the standard for witty sophisticated TV. Compare Diana Rigg as she was then, with how she appears on Game of Thrones and feel sad, but she's still cool!",1378252800,,212,4.461538461538462
7884281,5,630518223X,It's the Avengers and I used to watch them as a child. I didn't think the last few episodes with Diana Rigg were as good as the earlier ones. Not as clear as a DVD but playing it went off without any problems. I still enjoyed watching it.,1376438400,,238,3.9791666666666665

7884283,5,630518223X,"If you're not familiar with Buckminster Fuller, you will be amazed and excited by this film.
In the sixties, the saying went ""Don't trust anyone over 30... Except Buckminster Fuller."" This visionary thinker  not only became concerned about humanity's future, he devoted his life to  doing something about it.
See the amazing Dymaxion Car! Check out his  plans to provide shelter for the entire world!
A must see.",949363200,11,412,5.029411764705882
