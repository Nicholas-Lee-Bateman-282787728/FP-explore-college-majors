7801506,4,1932113134,Great information presented here. Worth adding to a training library. Video and audio quality leave something to be desired.,1450656000,,124,5.578947368421052
7801507,5,1932113134,"I have a few of Mr. McLemore's works, Books and DVD's, and he has a sound background and historical basis in the Traditional fighting styles of the West.  I especially like his series on Tomahawk/Knife fighting, and consider his work a must have for anyone seriously planning on carrying and using a LARGE knife and/or Hawk.  If you are planning on carrying a small knife, such as a tactical folder with a 2 or 3 inch blade, go with the works of Michael Janich and the Martial Blade Concepts.  I regularly hunt and shoot Blackpowder, and consider this a must have for anyone who is serious about prepping for the whatever takes us down senarios. If things go bad, we will run out of brass cartridges, you can only reload them so many times.  I can make primer caps, (yes, so can you), own a flintlock just in case, and can whip up some gunpowder with the help of a few chickens, and it's a possibility that we may just end up with a good one shot firearm, and a big knife or a hawk, or a combination of the two, being our only backup.  The techniques are easy to learn, and like any good system, takes a few good practice sessions to integrate, and a lifetime to Master. For the price, it's worth it. All of my Fightclub Girls have a copy, as any Chef's knife with a blade bigger than 6 inches works well with this system.  Anyone with a need to defend themselves, especially Single Women using tools found in a kitchen, should consider purchasing and reading this book, and if you don't like it, I am certain that you could re-gift it to some backwoods Mountain man...

7801508,5,1932113134,This is a good dvd.  I wanted to expand my knowledge of knife fighting. There is more out there about knife fighting than Filipino styles.  Check out the hockscqc.com site for more information about knife fighting.,1337212800,2,214,4.916666666666667
7801509,5,1932113134,"Please be aware that my gauge to compare Mr. Lemore DVD is Lynn Thompson ""Warriors Edge"" it is 7 hours long, and James A. Keating American Blade Craft the Bowie Knife 1-6 is 6 hours. Mr. Lemore's 55 minute. In that 55 minutes there is good information. Some of the information is the same as the other two DVD sets ""W.E."" and ""ABC"". There is some formation that was new to me. There is some sparring and a review of the sparring, which is something that is very good, that you do not see in most DVDs. If you are new to the blade, this is a very good source.
One bad thing is they need better quality control. My disc came broken at the center with a chip missing, but it still played.
Now get up and start training!",1335052800,7,716,4.121428571428571
7801510,5,1932113134,"I like this instructional video very much. It is simple, to the point and intelligent.

I have some Escrima background and I saw the familiar moves used with a bowie knife here. Simple and natural.",1329782400,,197,4.628571428571429
7801511,5,1932113134,"First of all, Dwight McLemore has published many books delving into the history and training methods behind many Renaissance and Frontier fighting styles. McLemore's books are, in my opinion, the standard by which others are judged in the arena of Frontier martial arts. When I saw McLemore's video on the Bowie Knife and the Big Knife Dueling system I knew it was the perfect completion to his book of the same title. If you want to see first hand how the Bowie knife was wielded as a weapon of defense and war, how the training around the Bowie knife system evolved from European swordplay, and the advantages as well as disadvantages of the knife itself, this video is a merited purchase. I highly recommend McLemore's book of the same title for reference. The Book goes into even more history about Jim Bowie, his brother Resin, and the evolution of the Bowie knife design. Overall a 5 star video that I'm glad I found.",1284076800,8,923,4.668711656441718
