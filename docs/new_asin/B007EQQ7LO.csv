5079690,5,B007EQQ7LO,"This is a well made indie slasher flick.  The last scene is one of my favorite moments in movie history.  Like the title of this says, so funny and so gross.",1335916800,,157,4.032258064516129
5079691,5,B007EQQ7LO,"I loved this movie, it reminded me of the old school gory classic films of the 80's but the one that were done well, this is a fun great ride, for any horror fan.",1335657600,,162,3.7941176470588234
8515407,2,B007EQQ7LO,i was disapointed.  there was no goat man.  what there was a lot of blood and gore.,1414368000,,83,3.823529411764706
8515408,3,B007EQQ7LO,"First off, the film is bad, but does have entertainment value. It opens with a couple parking. A guy in a Hawaiian shirt with an Elvis air freshener is attempting to get a girl drunk so he can score a kiss. He has his interior lights on and wipers going. There is an insect on the camera lens that is distracting. No money for retakes.

Goat man likes to disembowel his victims and leave visible entrails. The initial killing takes place in Pennsylvania and apparently they were able to get a good deal on pig intestines before they went off to the scrapple factory. 9 kids are on their way south to Florida for vacation. They travel in two cars that are designed to have the maximum internal conflict. They are traveling on a back road when we see a sign for Maryland on their way south to Florida. The next thing know they are near West Chester, Pennsylvania traveling on I-95 stopping at an Interstate rest stop. Then without getting off 95 they are suddenly on a back road, apparently the detour in the title, as one vehicle breaks down and we can guess the rest except for that one thing at the end which was Troma gory, funny, WTF scene involving ...well a bus filled with... Now that made the film.

This is a film for lovers of bad indie slashers with bad acting, unlikeable characters, an omnipresent killer, and over the top effects.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (male and female) gore, blood squirts.",1406246400,,1419,4.5136186770428015
8515409,1,B007EQQ7LO,"I agree with Dirk's review. The five-star reviews had to have come from the actors themselves. And to be honest, for viewers like myself, it's our own fault; you definitely take a risk of losing brain cells every time you venture into the slasher movie genre.

Now, there's slasher movies that are entertaining enough to watch, if for nothing more than to riff on them, and there are even a few genuinely good ones, such as John Carpenter's Halloween, ... and then there is this kind of bottom-of-the-barrel sludge. It gets to a point where the over-the-top gore isn't even funny - you just let out a low groan every time it graces the screen, and the cast headed for the meat grinder in this particular movie had to have been the most unlikeable jackasses ever who I couldn't wait to see die off (and unless it's a porn film, you need to warn us first before displaying a guy's junk right up into the face of the camera). The video and sound quality was beyond sub-par, and I don't see an excuse for it, even for ""effect"". And the final scene where the killer takes a machete to a busload of helpless blind people to the strains of bad grunge rock music is out and out tasteless - yes, even for a slasher movie. Geez.

Stay far away from this one, people. It's annoying, it's offensive, it's truly worthless crap.",1375920000,,1314,4.448132780082988
8515410,5,B007EQQ7LO,Awesome psycho killer thing-in-the-woods gorefest! And I mean gorefest. Great fun to watch. Lots of suspense. You have to see this tell me what you think!,1374969600,,154,4.961538461538462
8515411,5,B007EQQ7LO,There's something about the concept of a movie like this that I love. Goes back to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Days. Anytime anyone's car breaks down in a horror movie you know you're in for a treat. Old school cool.,1374710400,2,216,4.425
8515412,4,B007EQQ7LO,"This flick reminded me of classic horror stuff like Motel Hell. This is not some big budget Hollywood junk, it's an indie drive in style movie worthy of any true horror fan's attention.",1362441600,,185,4.636363636363637
8515413,1,B007EQQ7LO,I bought this in the shop looking at the cover thinking it looks really good.. Little did I know there's a reason they didn't put pictures from the film on the back of the case.. It's incredibly pony. The picture is worse than a 1mp camera phone. The acting is ridiculous a fat man having sex and saying its better than peanut butter jelly!!! There's no story no real plot and I have wasted money on this rubbish. And the picture on the case of the goatman isn't even in the film it's just a scarred old hillbilly man,1361664000,,517,4.232323232323233
8515414,1,B007EQQ7LO,"The other 4 reviews for this joke must of been from the ""actors"", this doesn't even deserve the one star. I am a huge fan of 80's slasher films and to compare this to those classics is sacreligious. The affects were horrible and laughable, the sound quality is also sub par, must have been filmed with mommy and daddy's old video camera, and the actors all look like they should be on the ""Biggest Loser"" instead of a low budget horror film.",1346544000,,441,4.390243902439025
8515415,4,B007EQQ7LO,"Deadly Detour is a bad movie, in terms of acting, script, direction, and pacing. However, it makes up for it all in over the top gore. The final half hour wallows in one gruesome death scene after another. There is even a massacre aboard a bus for the blind that is offensive and genius at the same time. Deadly Detour proves that all a slasher movie needs is a lot of decent gore to make it worth a watch. If you're a fan of Troma movies and the movies that Camp Motion Pictures have released, then Deadly Detour should be right up your alley.",1342137600,4,544,4.240384615384615
8515416,5,B007EQQ7LO,"It's silly shocking and gross.  What more could you ask for?  it to be universally praised like citizen kane?  well fornicate you, that isn't going to happen.  But the fact is that this is better than citizen kane.",1337817600,2,214,4.552631578947368
