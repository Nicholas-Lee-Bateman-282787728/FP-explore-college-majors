I've been working out with her from my old tapes since the 80s, the results stands to her word. That woman got it where I don't think no other trainer has. Try it, you'll see.

8273576,5,B0019D43QE,"Margaret Richard's workouts are always fantastic, and she is so much fun to work out with.  I love having this workout to do whenever I want to just work my muscles without aerobics.  And, her workouts aren't on PBS where I live(L.A.--can you believe that?!)  So...I love having this!
