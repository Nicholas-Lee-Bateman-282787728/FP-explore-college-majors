8101290,1,B000CRQX2U,"i was really looking forward to watching this DVD, but i was so disappointed, Dont want to judge but when did light and darkness come together, why did Anthony Anderson host it? There was no scriptures said, other than peoples trainers and shoes, awards and achievements, when did God judge the worship we give him, why awards? who is the judge? i felt it was just gospel people showing they can sing and perform, i don't know if GOD RECIEVED ANY GLORY IN THIS. Were people saved? thats our purpose as christians isn't it?",1149465600,7,522,4.5638297872340425
8101291,3,B000CRQX2U,"BET could have done better than this.  I'm a Praise & Worship Music Director and much of my youth in our praise band listens to many 'live' concerts.  We didn't see any band on this DVD.  We are big fans gospel/contemporary church music and we were disaappointed on this one.  It was like watching a CD.  This is a 'live' performance but no band.  Sorry fans.  IF you want to see a band behind the vocalists, look elsewhere.  Thanks.",1146528000,6,433,4.3924050632911396
8101292,3,B000CRQX2U,"I was looking forward to enjoying this DVD;  the artist line-up looked very promising, and I thought it would be similar to BET's ""Celebration of Gospel"".  I wasn't totally right in my assumption.

On the good side, as expected, all of the artists brought their ""A"" games with some soul-stirring, hand-waving vocal performances.  No special mention here-  Micah Stampley, Martha Munizzi, KiKi, Kelly Price, D. Haddon, Mary Mary, Hez & LFT, and the Keith Wilson Choir ALL had much energy and vocal power.  BUT...I may be picky, but they all performed to tracks- that is, there was no band, just the artists on a mostly barren stage singing to the music I can hear on their CD's.  This wasn't as big a deal to me in some cases, notably with Mary Mary's ""Yesterday"", which is a vocal heavy song anyway, and the Hez and K. Wilson songs that originally had bands performing the music tracks on CD.  But almost everything else stood out as slightly lacking without that good communication between musician and vocalist.  And to have big-name artists on a ""Live"", major distributed concert DVD singing to tracks is unacceptable in my book, especially when it is not the norm (See ""Commissioned Reunion- LIVE"", ""CeCe Winans- LIVE in the Throne Room"", ""Shakin' the House- LIVE From L.A."" or the dozens  of other excellent LIVE gospel concert DVD's for good examples).

The performances here are cool, the spirit was lifted throughout the show, and you should get this if you are a lover of these artists.  But the ""Celebration of Gospel"" show on BET had this beat by a long shot:  it had a full live band that added to the energy and spirit, and it was a lot longer, too!  So if you taped it keep it!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",1142035200,9,1714,4.629139072847682
