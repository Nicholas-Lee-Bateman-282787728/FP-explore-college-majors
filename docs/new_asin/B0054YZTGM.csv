8457151,5,B0054YZTGM,"My daughter has all of the Monkisee videos. This one is especially good because it encourages the child to get up and do the actions with the characters. I love to see my 16-month-old daughter spinning and marching along. She tries to jump, skip, and do other actions too.  The song is very repetitive which is excellent for very young learners. I can sing parts of the song to my daughter and she will attempt to do the action I am singing about. So even if she isn't saying the word yet, I know she understands the words. And she is able to say quite a few of her favorite actions. Jump is her very favorite. I hope you and your toddler can enjoy doing the actions together. Good indoor fun on cold winter days!",1387497600,,713,4.281481481481482
8457152,5,B0054YZTGM,I have been playing the Action Words DVD for my daughter Scarlett since she was only about 2 months old. She watches this everyday. I didn't realize just how much she was into these until one day when the theme song came on and she went flying across the house to see the TV and jump up and down in her walker. It is the cutest thing ever! She gets all into the DVD and even talks back. I love how at only 8 months these amazing videos stimulate her so much. I took a video of her running towards the TV in her walker. Wish I could show you how she just can't get enough of Monki See! Great products!!!,1334361600,,602,3.9834710743801653
8457153,5,B0054YZTGM,"I really like this DVD. It is so cute! My kids love Howie and Skip, and of course the host Olivia. Olivia is charming, she encourages the kids watching to join them in whatever action they are doing. My daughter really likes Olivia, while my sons relate more to Howie and Skip. The theme song is great. It is very repetitive, and is easy for the little ones to sing. I think that this DVD was a great buy, and I look forward to more MonkiSee DVDs!

8457154,5,B0054YZTGM,"My son loves the MonkiSee DVDs. We have them all and they really helped with his color and shape recognition as well as learning to read the words of all the shapes and colors with the flashcards. We just got the Action Words DVD. After watching it just once, he was chanting the song in the car while we were driving.",1308873600,,318,4.229508196721311
