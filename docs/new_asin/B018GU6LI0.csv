8742308,5,B018GU6LI0,"Melissa Errico adds yet another laurel to her crown of achievements with her show ""What About Today?"" which has now been released on DVD.  I played the disc 4 times on a Sony Blu Ray DVD machine and found both audio and video quality to be outstanding. What's especially interesting about this program is that the audio hasn't been ""sweetened"" (re-engineered) thus making it a truly ""live"" performance exactly the way it was heard in the 54 Below showroom. Ms Errico has long been delighting both Broadway and concert audiences world-wide with her dazzling lyric soprano.  She and her amazing trio of musicians led by maestro Tedd Firth on piano give us a delightful olio of songs culled from classic theater, film music and pop standards by such noted composers as Sondheim, Legrand, Schwartz & Bacharach.

Errico's 3 octave range is on full display whether she's ""belting"" out ""What About Today?"" & ""What Did I Have?"", or sweetly singing a lullaby ""Gentle Child"" which she wrote for her eldest daughter, and the lovely ""How Are Things In Glocca Morra?""  And she won't let us forget the song ""Show Me"" from her stint in ""My Fair Lady"" complete with it's glass-shattering ""high G"" at the very end of ""now""!  Melissa's ability to ""act"" as well as sing any song is brought forth favorably on ""It's An Art"" about Delores the waitress and ""Getting Married Today""(complete with bridal veil for comedic effect) all of which stopped the show!

The show has strong production values (great lighting, flattering camera angles, sharp sound) and enough talent onstage to last us all a lifetime.
Thank you Ms Errico & Co for a magnificent program.  Dare I say that we're all looking forward to your next DVD/CD!",1460592000,,1699,4.81786941580756
8742309,3,B018GU6LI0,"Melissa Errico is a great performer and deserves to be far better known than she is.

She also deserves a better show ""album"" than this sloppily recorded, unbalanced mess.

The audio is terrible and, at times, unintelligible; the camera work is... just sloppy.

There ARE ways to correct this; they are simple and basic and Errico has EARNED at least that much care

A lot of her comes shining through, which speaks volumes of her radiance, but REALLY!",1455494400,,452,4.756410256410256
