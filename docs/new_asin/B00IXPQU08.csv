6303948,5,B00IXPQU08,I enjoy these episodes more than the first two seasons because they don't feel so...simple.  The episodes in this series are nice and crisp with a clear picture that is even better than I remember 30 years ago.  Shout factory really should be commended for their treatment of our childhood treasures.  My four boys love these episodes and we watch some during every Saturday morning cartoon rotation.,1470700800,,400,4.940298507462686

6303953,3,B00IXPQU08,"A Blast from the past for me, I was addicted to Transformers as a kid and my 5yr old recently discovered this and has fallen in love with it too.  The only issue that I have is that this and season 2.2 were both shipped in one envelope and the DVD boxes were broken.  This one was crushed on the bottom, but the disks appear to be in good condition.  -2 for flimsy packaging and condition of the box",1424908800,,399,4.025316455696203

8646112,5,B00IXPQU08,"This is a really good collection for this series. All the extras you'd expect and a very nice transfer. The show itself is weirdly fascinating; the storytelling is far more ambitious than the first 2 seasons, with a smaller but better developed cast and more ongoing stories. However, the animation is of much lower quality And it never quite finds its footimf.",1518480000,,361,4.838709677419355

8646115,5,B00IXPQU08,Whoever tells you that this is the worst season is wrong!  Common complaint is that it's peppered with animation errors but that's overlooked when realize it has some of the best characters and designs out of the original 80's series.  Would recommend to any TF fan!,1493078400,,266,4.760869565217392
