8281536,5,B001B2KWDQ,"First of all, let it be known that this is a ""short"" independent film, 12 minutes to be exact. It is however, in my opinion, something that deserves watching. The first reviewer got this film confused with another film or TV series... so they were obviously disappointed. I really liked the plot and wished that the writer and/or director would have made it into a full length movie. Maybe that idea is still in the works... let's hope so. To the best of my knowledge, the film was shown at the ""Short Film Corner"" during the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, and it got ""rave"" reviews. To be included in this venue, a director's film can usually be no longer than 12 minutes, so that explains the running time of the DVD. Bottom line: if you can afford the current price of $10... go for it! Of course... you can always forget the DVD and buy 3 gallons of gasoline instead...",1223424000,,876,4.41358024691358

Don't be fooled into buying this along with ""Intervention Then and Now.""  That one is excellent.  I don't know how to get rid of this product.",1222214400,,245,4.170212765957447
