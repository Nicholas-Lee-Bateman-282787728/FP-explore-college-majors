The documentary can be used for educational purposes, to provide a background into Darfur, to build a background understanding on genocide, and to provoke thought regarding the mismanagement the political superpowers of today exercise.

The world was told, the world knew, the world mostly watched, and serious issues in the region go unresolved today. Sometimes I question the sanity of our species and this movie made me reflect this way once again.

3148425,4,B0015XHR6G,"Since 2003, the people of Darfur - mainly tribal blacks - have been undergoing a systematic genocide at the hands of the largely Arab-run government of Sudan (Darfur being a western region of that nation). The UN has estimated that, as of 2007, 200,000 residents of Darfur have been slaughtered and 2.5 million more displaced from their homes and forced to flee to refugee camps both inside Darfur and in neighboring countries.

The must-see documentary ""Darfur Now"" focuses on six specific individuals who have chosen to make a difference in the world.  Adam Sterling, co-founder of Sudan Divestment Task Force, is a young activist from Los Angeles who spends his time not only trying to raise public awareness of the atrocities taking place in that part of the world but also lobbying the California legislature and governor to get oil companies to stop funding the Sudanese government.  Luis Moreno-Ocampo is a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court whose job it is to build a case against the Sudanese government officials in order to bring them to justice in The Hague.  Ahmed Mohammad Abakar is the Chief Sheikh of the Hamadea Displaced Persons Camp.  Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda"") is, of course, a well-known movie star and author who has met with a number of world leaders on the issue.  Pablo Recalde is a humanitarian who delivers food to people in the refugee camps, often at great personal risk to himself and those who work with him.  And, finally, Hejewa Adam is a rebel for the Sudan Liberation Movement, a group dedicated to fighting back against the killers.

All six share a common belief that what happens to one person on this planet happens to us all - and it is this philosophy that motivates them to take an active role in doing everything they can to try and change that world.

Survivors of the raids recount in horrific detail the inconceivable suffering they have endured at the hands of the Janjaweed, an Arab militia unit funded by the government to carry out rapes, pillaging and murder on a massive scale (though the government, of course, denies it).  We also spend time with the rebel forces - motley bands of dedicated but poorly  armed and trained men and women who have taken to the hills to defend their lives and homeland, while they wait patiently and, in many cases, in vain for the ""white people"" to come and help them.

Writer/director Theodore Braun effectively cuts back and forth between his various subjects and, in so doing, brings an emotionally compelling dramatic arc to the film.

More than anything else, ""Darfur Now"" drives home how monumentally difficult and frustrating it can be to get recalcitrant people to put aside their daily concerns or foot-dragging governments their political expediency in order to help put an end to any humanitarian crisis, not just the one in Darfur.  But, at the same time, the film points out that people of goodwill, particularly if they are large enough in number, can have an enormous impact if they are simply willing to step up to the challenge.

Filled with both hope and heartbreak, ""Darfur Now"" is a fit companion piece to ""The Devil Came on Horseback,"" an equally compelling documentary on the same topic.  Together, these two fine films help to bring Darfur's plight to the world-at-large.

The theme of both films is, perhaps, best summed up by the actor George Clooney who, in a press conference on the issue, asks, ""One day this will end, and the question will be, where did the nations of these United Nations stand?""  Where indeed!",1266537600,5,3541,4.8344370860927155

8260350,5,B0015XHR6G,"Genocide is an issue that has angered and frustrated so many people. This film while exploring something seemingly so hopeless and so bleak in its subject matter shows that a great deal of involvement must take place in order to implement even the smallest of changes. I think this film should be required viewing for all of humanity. Ive seen several documentaries about genocide taking place currently and it makes me very angry. To think that even though the united states and other powerful nations have horrible genocides from the past to learn from, it astounds me how nothing ever changes. When people get involved they take on an incredible responsibility that can last many years and get them only another few feet forward in the war against genocide. One thing I learned from this film is that when movie stars become embassadors toward peace when the elected officials of their own country should be doing this is sickens me to the heart. To see those citizens of Sudan who are raped, tortured, burned, and driven from thier homes learning of the efforts of a few selfless people working hard together to create change, and these helpless people see them as saviors when they do so little is truly heartbreaking. By the end of this film so much work done by these determined individuals only results in so little being done about it, it makes me so frustrated. I begin thinking What can I do to help Maybe I should purchase a one way to ticket to Darfur, pick up an ak-47, and stand side by side with these brave women and men who have suffered unspeakable horrors and help fight the injustice. Maybe if 500,000 of us average americans were willing to do this maybe something truly significant could be done to stop to senseless horrors going on over there. It seems the work done through diplomatic channels isn't solving the problem, but something must be done. Am I willing to do what ever it takes even if it means my own life? Someone has to do it, so why not me. Why not you?",1367712000,,1992,4.598314606741573
