1530820,4,B00005JMET,"Intolerable Cruelty is by no means Joe and Ethan Coen best effort but it still has their trade mark stamp of eccentricity. George Clooney is fine as Miles Massey, a divorce attorney who is very good at his job but is smitten with a former client wife played equally as good by Catherine Zeta Jones who is out to take him for all he is worth. Edward Herrmann Is also very good as Clooney's client and Jones Ex husband.  Like all romantic comedies, they do fall in love, but like all Coen Brothers film, nothing is as strait forward as they seem. On their path to romance, there are other men, more dirty dealings, and a death scene that has to be seen to believe.
The problem I had with the movie is that it does lack a considerable amount of charm that the Coen Brothers other movies had in spades. O Brother Where Art Tho? Is a prime example of this because it had a true sense of charm with the far out plot that was with it. This film is more mean spirited in certain areas than it needs to be but it does retain some sense of balance between itself and the subject matter at hand.
Despite this, this is another good film by the Coen Brothers, and I being a fan of their work, can't wait for their next collaboration.",1066003200,,1220,4.213675213675214
1530821,4,B00005JMET,"When I first saw the previews for INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, I thought to myself, ""Oh, great, another romantic comedy."" Then I saw it was a Coen brothers' picture. I knew then that this wasn't going to be the typical romantic comedy. And it's not.
The Coen's have a knack for updating old films and giving them their own little twist (THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?). In INTOLERABLE CRUELTY the Coen's update those charming 1930-1950's romantic comedies (often starring Cary Grant or somebody with his looks) that we love so much. Clooney is once again the lead man playing a lawyer who has it all, but love. In some ways, his character is a continuation of the one he played in O'BROTHER, for example in O'BROTHER his character was fascinated by his hair and in INTOLERABLE CRUELTY his character is obsessed with his teeth. Both films deal with a journey, but this time Clooney's character already is king of his world and he hasn't lost his kingdom (at least not initially).
Catherine Zeta-Jones turns in a delightful performance as the man-hater trying to catch a rich husband. Zeta-Jones is a wonderful actress and for a change, it's a joy seeing someone who has a more, realistic figure, than many of the other leading ladies currently at the top of the game in Hollywood.
The plot of INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is as convoluted as every other Coen picture and would take awhile to explain. Under an average director, the film would have suffered terribly. However, using that charming Coen wit, the brothers have taken a somewhat, cheesy parody and turned into a comic delight, complete with a happy ending. Both men and the women they love will enjoy this film. It's the perfect date movie.",1065830400,7,1701,4.808873720136519
1530822,4,B00005JMET,"The Coen brothers won me over with the hilarious ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" so when I saw this film about to be released, I was, shall we say, excited. Add to the mix the always wonderful George Clooney and the marvelous Catherine Zeta-Jones, and you get what promises to be a great ride.
""Intolerable Cruelty"" does not disappoint. I came in with high expectations for this film, and I was more than happy with the result. The acting is great. The script is great. The directing is great. It's just a fun, heartwarming movie.
""IC"" is filmed with the same muted hues as ""O Brother,"" and the humor is in the same vein, but a little bit more accessible. If you liked ""Brother,"" you'll love this. If you didn't, there's still a chance you'll like it.
Clooney does a great job in his role as Miles; I think he continues to grow as an actor. After the moody ""Solaris,"" it was nice to see him as a romantic, humorous lead. Zeta-Jones, recently of ""Chicago"" fame, is, if I may quote Clooney's character, ""fascinating.""
Great job all around to this cast and crew, marvelous film!!",1065830400,3,1072,4.5025641025641026
1530823,3,B00005JMET,"The ""screwball"" comedy has died. But I enjoy seeing a really good one. I think my favorite might be ""The Awful Truth"" a movie that the Coen's seemed to have been inspired by. But unlike films such as ""The Awful Truth"" or ""His Girl Friday"", ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"" ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't seem to have that charm. The movie is not as witty as those older movies. Granted I did enjoy the performances by George Clooney (who I think is in pitch perfect Cary Grant mode) and Catherine Zeta-Jones (in a role I guess 50 years ago would have gone to Irene Dunne or Myrna Loy). And I even consider myself a fan of the Coen brothers. I've seen almost all of their movies. But I've never felt their strenght lies in their wit. They make movies that have a quirky off-beat charm and originality to them. Sure many times I laugh when watching their movies. I enjoy ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", but I'm not sure if the Coen's were actually the correct choice for such a project. As pointed out by others the material doesn't seem to suit their style of film-making.
 ""Intolerable Cruelty"" starts off with Donovan Donally (Geoffrey Rush) divorcing his wife, who was cheating on him. She goes after Miles Massey (Clooney) to represent her during the divorce, of course he wins the case for her. Fast forward, we meet Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) who is married to Marylin (Jones). He is cheating on her. Only problem for him is, she finds out. He gets Massey to represent him and guess what happens. Yep, he falls for Marylin. It has the possibilities to make a great old-fashioned ""screwball comedy"" only the movie never quite reaches the hits it could have. I was left disappointed. Maybe I brought it on myself. Perhaps I walked into the movie with such high expectations that the movie never could have lived up to them. I was expecting to be enchanted by the wonderful witty tongue and cheek humor. I was prepared to love the characters and be amazed by the chemistry between Clooney and Jones. And I wanted to be able to tell everyone this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and one of the Coen's best. But if I said most of those things, I'd be lying. The movie leaves much to be desired.
 Now I don't want people to think I'm bashing the Coen brothers because I don't like them. That's not true. I am a fan. I think ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" was one fo the best films of 2001. ""Miller's Crossing"" is my favorite of their movies. I got a kick out of ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and ""Fargo"". But ""Intolerable Cruelty"" just doesn't quite deliver. It doesn't seem to have the fun movies like ""The Awful Truth"" or ""His Girl Friday"" had. It's admirable but nothing great.
 Bottom-line: Weak Coen brothers comedy. Doesn't seem as quirky as the rest of their films and doesn't compare to older ""screwball comedies"" of the past. Worthwhile for die-hard fans of Coen brothers.",1065830400,,2919,4.535104364326376
1530824,1,B00005JMET,Considering the talent involved in this piece of rubbish I thought it would be decent. But it was a woeful and unfunny mess. Truly awful.,1065830400,,137,4.52
1530825,5,B00005JMET,"Ok, I've never seen any Coens Brothers films before, so I cant compare it to their other films but in my opinion it was GREAT and HILARIOUS!!!!! I cracked up like 100 times during the movie! No this movie, isn't deep like others but it really a good romantic comedy! Catherine is beautiful and George is such a hottie! In the begining you may think you went in the worng theater but George finally shows up! They are soo funny, George has an odd obsession with teeth, and Rex Rexwroth (One of Marilyns Husbands) has an obsession with trains! The plot has several twists that keep you interested, and hilarious dialouge! Every charecter is wonderful! Billy Bob Thorton play a oil guy (hem hem lol) Cedric The Entertainer plays a private investigator, Julia Duffy plays Marilyn's best friend and fellow divorcee. It is just so great that you totally have to see it!",1065744000,3,863,4.647058823529412
1530826,4,B00005JMET,"George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones are two exceptionally beautiful people.  Seeing them together on the screen is great eye candy and almost enough to guarantee a hit movie.  The ever-quirky Coen brothers have come up with a farce modeled after the old 1930's ""madcap and zany"" romantic comedies; the trouble is you need a scorecard to keep track of the action and it really isn't worth the trouble.
Clooney plays Miles, a super-smooth, cynical divorce attorney who cleverly wins a case against serial-gold-digger Zeta-Jones.  The two are (of course) attracted to each other; she appears to change her ways, and he becomes a believer in the power of love.  They marry, and the twists and turns of the script have just begun.
For a silly diversion, it's fine; the co-stars are dazzling.  Clooney certainly takes on the mantle of the new Cary Grant, while Zeta-Jones is a combination of Scarlett O'Hara and Bette Davis.  They're a pleasure to watch, indeed; I just hoped for more of a realistic plot and less farce.  There is only one joke in the movie that caused real guffaws (it involves a gun and an asthma inhaler).  The rest of the film is a lovely, sometimes confusing, sometimes silly battle of the sexes.  I left the theatre not being able to remember anything about it, but having greatly enjoyed George Clooney's close-ups.",1065744000,6,1337,4.854625550660793
1530827,4,B00005JMET,"There is a point in Intolerable Cruelty where George Clooney is giving a key note speech professing his love that is long enough to make you suspect the Coen brothers have ""sold out"" into schmaltz.  Wrong!  The film, in typical Coen style, dives into as many twists and turns as is needed in a good thriller.  Fortunately, the film is a comedic farce.
Clooney plays Miles Massey, the most prominent divorce lawyer in southern California.  A man so good at what he does he has a prenuptial contract named after him.  Massey's good and he knows it.  Near the beginning of the film, he and his assistant, Wrigley (Paul Adelstein), are chatting about how boring Massey's life has become while a sweating client sits between them as the client's wife describes how she was used as a sex slave.  Massey is that confident of himself.
And confidence is what Clooney is all about.  He is simply incredible.  Swaggering around like a peacock while checking to make sure his teeth are clean, Clooney gives his best performance.  There is no denying his charm here.  Even when he's being a prig.
Enter Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman who's only goal is to marry a rich man, catch him in some indiscretion and divorce him for half of what he's worth.  She wants to be independent she claims.  Massey falls for her completely.  She is his match in game-playing and confidence and he must have her.
Thus sets up the Coens' romantic comedy farce.  It's bizarre at times, but humorous throughout as one coincidental incident sets-up another and turns all the characters on both of their ears.  This is probably their fluffiest piece ever, but highly entertaining nonetheless.",1065571200,47,1674,4.800699300699301
1530828,5,B00005JMET,"Intolerable Cruelty is no doubt one of the Coen Brothers most commercial and light-hearted films to date. Yet it doesn't let you down with it's scintillating witty dialogue and ingeniously funny plot. George Clooney plays Miles Massey, a divorce lawyer at the height of his powers with immaculately white teeth which he endless checks. Massey must defend a new client against the gold digging and ravishingly beautiful Marylin Rexroth played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Marylin and Massey strike up an instant romantic rapport despite their cynical outlooks on the institution of marriage and the phenomenon of love. Both are carefully guarded and watching sharply for the inevitable double cross they've come to expect.
This is an incredibly enjoyable romantic comedy directed by two masters of cinema. Each carefully constructed gag doesn't fail to miss its target. Taking advantage of a big budget, the Coen brothers capture the sumptuously beautiful landscape of upper class California with beautiful shots. Apart from the leads, two of the best performances come from Billy Bob Thornton who plays a brilliant kind of double role and Irwin Keyes in his short-breathed assassin-for-hire role of Wheezy Joe. Far from the dark humor so brilliantly realized in Fargo and The Man Who Wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty is nonetheless a hilarious satire about California marriage with plenty of delights.",1065484800,,1398,5.3881278538812785
1530829,5,B00005JMET,"I saw a test screening of ""Intolerable Cruelty"" last Spring and am impatiently awaiting the opportunity to see it again. For many years I've been a devotee of the Coen brothers' work and this is a welcome addition to their filmography. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" has elements which remind me of many of their previous films. This despite the fact that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is the first production for which they did not write the screenplay. I don't blame them for this, its a fantastic script. The dialogue immediately struck me as having the extra wit, style, and layeres of subtlety common to Big Lebowski, and O Brother Where Art Thou?
The Los Angeles setting and eclectic characters is reminiscent of Lebowski. However, Clooney's character, a prominent divorce attorney spews gab like Ulysses Everitt McGill, only with better credentials. Intolerable Cruelty, despite its title, is also much lighter than anything else by the Coens- except perhaps Hudsucker Proxy. Lighthearted even with much of the storyline devoted to social climbing wives and fidelity-impaired husbands.
The entire cast gives wonderful performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones has regained her title as sexiest woman in my world after her femme-fatale performance here. Clooney is perfect for his fast-talking part. Billy Bob, Geoffrey Rush, and Cedric the Entertainer all have memorable minor parts. Paul Adelstein is great as Clooney's understudy sidekick.
Intolerable Cruelty is not perhaps a troubling, deep cinematic masterpiece on the order of Miller's Crossing or Fargo. But it is a fantastic comedy with many instantly quotable lines (""You fascinate me"") and subtely worth repeated viewings. With its big name cast this film is likely to once again return the Coen brothers to mainstream prominence. A most welcome prospect for such a strong film.",1060300800,5,1821,5.370629370629371
1531146,4,B00005JMET,Arrived as promised. Looks and sounds good. While it's a lesser Coen brothers effort it's still worth buying at a good price.,1504224000,,125,4.7272727272727275
1531147,1,B00005JMET,An incredibly stupid movie. The ending makes no sense at all. What a waste of 1 1/2 hours. I cannot believe the Coen Brothers were involved in this piece of trash!,1501804800,,163,4.290322580645161
1531148,4,B00005JMET,"The Coen Brothers named O Brother Where Art Thou after a film title in Sullivan's Travels, but Intolerable Cruelty plays more like a Preston Sturges romantic film with quick pacing, plot twists and dialogue filled with double entendres (The Massey pre-nup cannot be penetrated). This movie escaped me upon it's 2003 release, but I bought the Dvd when I was catching up on Coen Brothers films that I had not seen. This is not the Coens' best comedy (Raising Arizona, Fargo, Big Lebowski), but after watching it several times in the past few years, it provides many laughs. Billy Bob Thorton has a small but funny role, especially the scene in the lawyer's office. Catherine Zeta-Jones turns in a great performance and she looks absolutely stunning.",1500940800,,747,4.936507936507937

I do think the title was a problem, as it doesn't inspire you to see the film and doesn't convey really anything about what you're going to see.

1531317,5,B00005JMET,"This movie. Totally not my regular fare, yet I found it really enjoyable. Of-course this was heavily influenced by the presence of George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones. But even outside of these two, the plot was quite interesting. It's essentially a battle of wits between a beautiful gold digger and a Beverly Hills divorce lawyer, who is increasingly attracted to her.

What was even more interesting than the plot, was that I enjoyed it - a lot, in-spite of the fact that it wandered in a very morally grey area, and that is not something that I usually like in romances.  But I guess, there are always exceptions, and this just happens to be one of them.

Needless to say, I highly recommend this one - for the engaging plot, the alluring Catherine Zeta-Jones, and a heavy dose of the Clooney Charm.

1531318,4,B00005JMET,"It's worth your time as a departure from the heaviness of life - light comedy, especially a scene where George Clooney and Paul Adelstein tried to stop a hitman.  Paul Adelstein was so great. He cracked me up! As did Billy Bob Thornton. Where do they get these actors? So much fun. So much talent.
And the movie is worth it for the brief appearances of Geoffrey Rush - for that alone! omg the man is so gifted.
We all know how charismatic George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones are - gifted AND lovely to watch. I thought, #NoSeriously?
I could have totally done without the character played by Tom Aldredge as an elderly head of the law firm. Grisly. Save him for the horror movies - maybe one of the Saw pictures or a Quentin Tarantino flick. #ManGoodbye",1478649600,,757,4.4855072463768115

I wonder who, if anyone, liked this movie. the title led me to believe it might be funny and full of banter possibly like ""One Fine Day"" but I didn't find it funny at all. I watched and watched and thought these two actors must redeem themselves and the movie but that never happened and I shut it off when Clooney's character fell for her for no apparent reason other than her beauty which was not even well portrayed.

The female character in this movie is a liar and a thief/cheat and didn't have any interesting character traits, just beauty. The set up for her was fast enough to realize her antics but I found the movie to be dull and slow. Clooney's character was supposed to be one of the most talented divorce lawyers and knew of her antics but somehow is ""intrigued"" by her and falls for her which made the plot even more stupendous. I believe in the end the plot was a set up from the beginning.

All in all I had no attachment to either character in the movie or as actors. I felt it was so terrible I I can not figure out why George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones chose to be in this movie, and wonder how they honestly feel about the result.",1461715200,2,1398,4.208955223880597

1538341,4,B00005JMET,"This is a very enjoyable Coen Brothers movie. George Clooney plays a divorce lawyer. He doesn't think much of marriage. He has met his match though with Catherine Zeta-Jones. For good measure, the Coens have thrown in Billy Bob Thornton in a supporting role as a potential husband for Zeta-Jones. Thornton is so funny, as usual, that he almost steals the entire movie. This is more of a feel-good comedy than one is used to seeing with the Coens. It is a lot more mainstream rom-com, almost like a throwback to the screwball comedies of the earlier twentieth century. If you have been missing that kind movie, as I have, you will have a good time with this one. This is not the typical ""Oscar Winning"" Coen product or one of their ""Cult favorites."" If you are looking for those, their more usual kind of film, you may not be happy with this one.",1461196800,,845,4.4935064935064934

1542809,5,B00005JMET,"This is a comedy and nothing else, but a comedy about the worst tragedy imaginable: the exploitation of marriage by social climbing women who marry rich men only to divorce them later with a very comfortable alimony or settlement, or even more and worse than that: a fully naked stripping court order, the type of court order in which you have to borrow a bath towel from the concierge or plain night warden to be able to run to your taxi without being arrested.

Imagine one of the best divorce attorneys in the field who destroys the claim of one of these ladies in court by demonstrating, one key witness in the stand, that the lady is nothing but a marriage bounty huntress, and then there he is falling in love with her, marrying her on a whim, with the best pre-nup contract you can imagine, tearing it up just after the wedding, confronting her for the divorce and falling in love again in the confrontation in the lawyers office and this time she destroys the pre-nup.

Dont try to see anything subtle or deep in that. Love is unpredictable and no one can live forever without love, even someone as cold as the iceberg that sank the Titanic or as calculating as a world class chess player. But I must say it is so funny to see all divorce procedures, out of court or in court, ridiculed and being made fun of. It is true thats what they deserve. But even so, man, marriage is a sacred institution, isn't it?

But do not try to have nightmares on such a film. That is absolutely impossible.

It reminds me just a bit of the Hepburn and Tracy comedies where both characters are a bit too smart for their own good. It does not seem to move as fast in some places in the film but has some very quick moving parts with plenty of chuckles.
We enjoyed it even though we are not  big romantic comedy people. We are, however, big Coen Bros people so that can explain it. Clooney is so perfect in his Coen roles. Actually, he naturally does some of the same style Tracy eye popping expressions and exaggerations. To me though Clooney is a bit  more like Cary Grant in that he can carry off so many characters but still be Clooney.  Zeta Jones is believable but not as amazing as in Chicago, but I digress.
Expect some Coen Bros dark humor. You have got to watch this just to see the head of the divorce firm character. He is absolutely over the top and spot on funny.  ""Billable hours"" OMG see it just for that character! The Coen's do the Monty Python exaggeration sometimes and it fits perfectly in their films.

1543261,4,B00005JMET,"I liked this ""romantic black comedy"" and my wife liked it even more. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a top divorce attorney, known for his incredible rate of wins in courts and also for the ""Massey Pre-nup"", a supposedly completely foolproof prenuptial agreement. Marylin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a serial gold-digger, widely known for marrying wealthy men and then quickly and efficiently divorcing them with extreme prejudice (for them...). It is therefore only a question of time before those two cross swords in a series of legal (and other) fights which will be waged with INTOLERABLE CRUELTY!

This film is a comedy but this is the kind of comedy only brothers Coen can do - you must therefore be ready for absolutely anything and everything and the only thing which is certain is that you will be taken on a wild ride full of surprises, surrealistic converstions (especially in courts of justice) and some suprisingly good gags! Also interesting appearances by Geoffrey Rush, Billy Bob Thornton and Cedric the Entertainer. And of course at one moment Miles boss Herb Myerson (Tom Aldredge) and Wheezy Joe (Irwin Keyes) will make their appearance - but I am not saying anything more about them, you must discover it by yourself...)))

I am extremely surprised that so many people hated this film. Me, I spend a good moment watching this cynical and cruel but quite irresistible very dark ""romantic comedy"" in which Catherine Zeta-Jones is splendidly beautiful (and deadly venomous!).

1543267,3,B00005JMET,"Clooney and Zeta-Jones were at their physical peaks in this 2003 Coen Brothers vehicle. But this movie is lacking for a Coen production. It's got a few mildly funny moments, but mostly it's a little too over-the-top and not quite arch enough for its own good. The wit is not especially witty. The gold-digger has been done to death, and this one falls somewhere in the middle of the pack for quality. Clooney has a few good lines, but his comedic tics in this are a little too overstated. And Zeta-Jones plays it a bit too Sphinx-like overall, for her to be anywhere near as alluring as she is supposed to be. Billy Bob Thornton is kind of wasted. His screen time is minimal, but it's not great. Overall, an okay watch, but don't expect to be wowed.",1387324800,,749,4.434782608695652

It isn't exactly a bad movie. There are a few funny moments in it, but for a comedic farce it produces very few laughs.

Granted, it has a couple great actors (George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones), who play their characters well (although Clooney in particular has done better). So, if you're a Clooney or a Zeta-Jones fan you may want to watch it for that reason.

Otherwise, after the first ten minutes, it is at once unbelievable yet somehow utterly predictable. Its ending is trite. And the transformation of Clooney's character (Miles Massey), when he rips up his keynote speech at the beginning of the divorce lawyer's convention in Las Vegas and discourses on the importance of love, is quite unmotivated by anything in the movie to this point.

So, if you're looking for a fairly mindless film with a couple good actors to while away an hour and a half, watch it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",1378166400,,1069,4.798913043478261

I mean, everyone but everyone who is into movies knows about the Coens and of course they know Lebowski and Fargo and Raising Arizona... but mention this one and they get this weird look on their faces, like they think I've been hitting the pipe or something. I will freely admit when it first came out I thought the Coens had lost the plot. It just looked so... NORMAL. Oh ye of little faith!

After the first watch it was immediately apparent the Coens had found another vehicle to pay homage to the nutjob man vs woman comedies of the past, perhaps most famously played by Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn. But this is much better than any of those. The script is, of course, the true hero here but the leads are equally fantastic. Clooney sends himself up brilliantly as the egotistical divorce lawyer having a mid-career crisis and this is undoubtedly Zeta Jones' finest hour. She is drop dead gorgeous naturally, but also extremely funny in her role as the femme fatale gold-digger, with perfect comedic timing.

The entire movie is also chock full of hilarious moments from the plethora of supporting roles, all playing it to the max.

1543777,3,B00005JMET,"I've been a fan of the Coen brothers since their film `Blood Simple' but oddly, I just watched their film `Intolerable Cruelty'. Why did it take me 9 years to watch? Perhaps it has to do with the fact that neither Clooney or Zeta-Jones are my favorite actors nor do I consider looks a necessary ingredient for getting my fanny in a movie seat.

One consideration in a film like this, and one which I was concerned with, has to do with the chemistry between the main actors - Clooney and Zeta-Jones. Everything supporting the reasons for their union is all riding on their interaction. Do they pull it off? Well, yes and no.

Let me preface this by first saying that the characters were clearly written as caricatures - I wouldn't be surprised to hear these were based on people the Coen brothers knew in real life. So given this, a question is posed to the audience about interpreting their brand of on-screen `love'. Can we empathize with them knowing certain exaggerations are taking place? For the most part, no - the action is played out as you would imagine a Coen brothers film to develop (think Raising Arizona) and yet, amidst the comedic farce and far-fetched storytelling, this film manages to capture a couple of honest moments that give you pause to consider the zany, sometimes ludicrous scenario played out on screen isn't that far from reality. These `real' moments are nice when they occur because they step aside from `tongue-in-cheek' action to illustrate just how reality is strange and wonderful in its own right.

The supporting cast is well rounded and adept at performing their requisite parts right on cue, especially Paul Adelstein - Clooney's sidekick buddy. Zeta-Jones' comedic timing was somewhat off. She seems to lack an effort at making fun of her role instead of trying to look perfect. Perhaps she forgot she was in a comedy. The moral that is hinted at, yet not fully developed, is `what good is wealth without love?' and whether you buy this or not largely depends on your definition of `love'. For instance, Clooney's character seems to be in `love' with the challenge of getting a girl he considers unforgettable, rather than feeling an intimate closeness to a person he can nurture a relationship with. He is simply captivated by a heavenly creature much like Gene Wilder was captivated by a woman in red in the film `The Woman in Red'. However, to compare these two films of infidelity/adultery would be like comparing a Sony Walkman to an Apple Ipod. Suffice to say that love, lust or like will get us all in trouble at some point in our lives. It's only natural, so make sure to laugh out loud when it happens.

Bottom line: Does the film advance cinema to the next level. No Rosebud, sorry. Is it a fun ride? Sure, if you think poking infidelity in the eye can be humorous. Will it bring you closer to reaching Nirvana? It depends - If people can find salvation & forgiveness after praying to a faint image of a deity on a tortilla, I wouldn't rule out becoming enlightened after watching the film.  I gave it 3 stars because the film is entertaining, stylish and it doesn't portend to preach about religious values or loose morals.",1336348800,,3174,4.6708407871198565

I am surprised at the many negative reviews here and on IMDB.com. I consider myself to be a picky movie watcher, not easily impressed.
Intolerable Cruelty (awful title) is one of the rare films to impress me recently.
The production is very slick, as is to be expected from the Coen brothers. The acting by Clooney and Zeta-Jones is top-notch, and they were cast perfectly for their roles. There is a colorful cast of supporting characters. The film only made me laugh out loud once in a while, but almost every scene is fun since the movie doesn't take itself seriously. The plot is full of unpredictable twists, keeping things lively. The writing is excellent, with many clever lines. By the end I was truly jumping out of my seat, raving about how great a movie it is.

If you don't believe me, here's a quote from professional film reviewer James Berardinelli (reelviews.net):

[...] for those who like intelligent, quirky movies filled with big laughs, dry wit, and other small pleasures, it's difficult to beat Joel and Ethan Coen's humorous outings. Intolerable Cruelty is the most recent of these - a film that takes the traditional romantic comedy and tweaks it by way of The War of the Roses. Rarely has strife between the sexes been so ruthless, so civilized, and so funny.

Sated on success, boredom has set in and he's looking for new challenges. All that changes when Miles meets his match in the devastating Marylin Rexroth. Marylin is the soon-to-be ex-wife of his client Rex Rexroth, a wealthy real estate developer and habitual philanderer.

1543887,2,B00005JMET,"A comedy of Hollywood infidelity and monetarily inspired marital maneuverings, Intolerable Cruelty is probably the Coens' worst movie. It stars George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a pair of shallow, greedy shells of human beings, Clooney a highly successful divorce lawyer, schooled in the practice of winning arguments by any means necessary, and Zeta-Jones a conniving, cold-hearted seductress out to catch, and then divorce, a rich husband for half his money. Both show a stunning facility to lie and manipulate. Naturally, they end up together, and while the film itself is unremarkable it does have something to say about the highly ponerized qualities of Western culture.

Take this line from Clooney's character, Miles Massey, delivered to a cheating wife whose husband caught her in the act, and who, of course wants ""fair"" representation: ""Hmm... Hmm... Yes, your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of a pool man would appear to be suspicious. But, Madam, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest to you the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion had slapped you, beat you...""

While the Coens humorously push this human tendency to create one's reality out of thin air throughout the movie, sometimes to a ridiculous degree, the line pretty much captures the modus operandi of the film's characters, and of the entire Western legal system. It also points out the main weakness of our culture as a whole, and the reason we won't last long. A culture without a popular understanding of psychopathy faces a very real danger from the very thing of which they are unaware, and a culture without a popular understanding of psychopathy and whose citizens demonstrate an almost inborn tendency to lie, to create personal fictions and to even come to believe those fictions, all to present themselves in a better light, is hurtling so fast towards self-destruction that is perhaps unavoidable at this point.

There is a phrase to describe these fictions that people like Miles Massey are so adept at conjuring up out of thin air. They are called cover stories, plausible stories made to put the facts in a light completely at odds with the reality of a situation. The motivations are simple. In a legal system it goes as follows: how can I put my client, who is undoubtedly guilty, in a good enough light that the judge or jury will be convinced that they are innocent? How can I lie well enough to convince them that it is my opponent that is lying? How can I make my client's victim look like the guilty party? In other words, it's all about perception-management, creating a version of the ""truth"" that benefits the client, and playing with ""facts"" in such a way that the word loses all meaning.

The notion of the cover story maps our reality so well that if we trace its roots we are led directly to the roots of the human condition, that murky territory plumbed with such insight by the best philosophers, mystics, novelists, and poets (I'd normally include the Coens in this category, but they lose points on this one). From the self-deceptions of everyday life to the ""big lies"" told by the scammers who call themselves leaders, most of our notions about life are often little more than cover stories to hide a truth we refuse to see, and often a reality that is too scary to imagine.

And when a society develops the habit of twisting the truth, malicious abuse of the truth becomes easy and prevalent. Western culture is asphyxiated by it. Our thinking becomes increasingly pathological and downright wrong, making us vulnerable to those who take advantage of this face-saving tendency. In other words, when we lie to ourselves, we're easy prey for psychopaths who lie to us. We may identify with our nationality to the extent that we filter out negative thoughts about our leaders and our conduct with other countries. We may ignore the atrocities committed in our names. Even worse, we may take the bait offered by our leaders and substitute important data, reaching pseudo-logical and pseudo-moral opinions. ""They deserve it, because they hate us."" ""That massacre wasn't actually a massacre. They fired first after all, and we were only defending ourselves."" ""The guy had weapons of mass destruction."" ""They're the ones that want to kill us, we're just making sure they'll never get the chance.""

We buy the cover story, hook, line, and sinker. On a cultural level, the process is called myth-making. We create grand histories, semi-mythical founders of nations, charter documents that sustain the false belief that we are something we are not. The process is described at length in several books. Burton Mack's latest,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Myth-and-the-Christian-Nation-A-Social-Theory-of-Religion-Religion-in-Culture-Studies-in-Social-Contest-Construction/dp/1845533720/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Myth and the Christian Nation: A Social Theory of Religion (Religion in Culture: Studies in Social Contest & Construction)</a>, is a good start and Shlomo Sand's bestseller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invention-of-the-Jewish-People/dp/1844674223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invention of the Jewish People</a>, is a great case study of these processes in action. It is by the cultural substitution of data that we come to see ourselves as a people at odds with another people. We twist the facts available to come to mistaken conclusions about who the real enemy of humanity is, and who is responsible for the propagation and manipulation of myths in the first place: psychopaths. Andrew Lobaczewski's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Political-Ponerology-A-Science-on-the-Nature-of-Evil-Adjusted-for-Political-Purposes/dp/1897244258/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)</a>&nbsp;is the book that puts it all together and offers the solutions.

When we consider some facts that, taken separately, are relatively easy to believe, the situation becomes clearer. Psychopaths thrive in corporations and politics (witness Madoff and Blagojevich), and the violent ones are considered the worst of the worst criminals (most serial killers are psychopaths). And with unlimited black budgets, cannon fodder soldiers, crafty intelligence agencies with generations of experience in making murder look like an accident, political psychopaths, simply by virtue of the scope of their influence, are potentially the most dangerous. When you combine these facts with the existence of a public that has lost its ability to think, patently false cover stories find fertile ground in the whitewashed pastures of the Western mind, where truth is buried and artifice taken for authenticity.",1266105600,3,6904,5.5632730732635585

1543890,4,B00005JMET,"I kept waiting for INTOLERABLE CRUELTY to become a real Coen Brothers movie.  What it wound up coming closest to was a sort of Coen Brothers knock-off.  If I'd learned it was the work of Coen wannabes, it'd have made sense.  And as a star vehicle for George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, it's not bad.  And it has plenty of humorous bits.  (I'll be sure to think twice before next using my asthma inhaler).  Visually, it seems to be the least striking of the brothers efforts.  You couldn't be faulted for wondering if Roger Deakins, the Coens' regular cinematographer hadn't sat this one out.  But like his cohorts on the directorial end of things, he really WAS there--though maybe not fully invested in the project.

As a screwball comedy, CRUELTY seems a much more conventional genre flick than, say, the earlier HUDSUCKER PROXY.  Its reputation as the Coens' most mainstream effort is pretty well deserved.  On the other hand, it's still quietly subversive.  If Clooney and Zeta-Jones drip star power throughout, it doesn't erase the fact that neither is particularly likeable.  But with stars of that magnitude, it actually may take a little while to realize that you really don't care for them as people.  They charm the audience just about as effectively as they charm everyone else in the movie AND each other.

Like most screwball comedies, the movie ends happily (and this can't be a spoiler for anyone at this point, can it?)  Perhaps, I should say, happily enough.  Who knows what's in store for these two actually.  They may continue to scheme against each other for the rest of their godforaken lives. Old habits die hard, after all.  Still they look great together.  And deserve each other in every sense.

Friends who are not quite as smitten with the Coen oeuvre as I am have commented on how much they actually LIKE this film.  That may be INTOLERABLE CRUELTY'S most subversive quality.  If it gets people to look anew at FARGO, LEBOWSKI, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and rest of the brothers' more ""difficult"" work, it will have done its (dirty)job well indeed.

1543891,3,B00005JMET,"Considering that the majority of reviews are 1 star, one would think this was ""Are We There Yet?"" or ""Cat in the Hat"" (the Mike Myers version) awful. Please people. I realize that movie goers have come to expect brilliance from the Coen brothers at every turn, but this is far from the wretched mess so many people claim.
It reminds me of the movies from years long past that were simply charming, cute, and easy to digest. Add the sharp wit, predictable slapstick, and fondness for romantic sentiment of this filmmaking team and you have a better than average comedy with fine acting from all present, especially the main pair of Zeta-Jones and Clooney. If this movie were sixty years old and starred Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, you'd have few complaints.
While it might be hard to do, try to watch this movie and not think about who made it and maybe you'll enjoy it more if you approach it with much lower expectations.
One dvd note: the version I have did not have the issue of forced preview screenings. I went straight to the main menu and watched the movie without previews.

Sure there were fun scenes, which could only be from a Coen Brother's mind. There was also plenty of twists as well, but for me the twists were obvious and practical next steps to the storyline.

""Well, he's the tennis pro at the club..""
""The tennis pro?  Then why are your letters addressed to him 'Dear David and Goliath'?

Clooney is gleeful and effervescent as divorce attorney Miles Masey;  I don't know how he manages to give such beleivable (and humorous) little touches to the different characters he plays in the Cohen movies.  He really becomes a different person, and it's great to see him in yet another comedic role (last one I saw was in Oh Brother).

""I've invested 5 good years to my marriage to Rex,"" says Catherine Zeta Jone's character, ""and I've finally nailed his *ss fair and square.  Now I'm going to have it stuffed and mounted and have my lady friends come over and throw darts at it... this divorce means money and independence.  That's what I'm after.  What are you after, Miles?""

Miles - ""Well, I'm a lot like you.. just looking for an *ss to mount..""

There are lots of tongue and cheek lines, with quick unknowing delivery, that had me more than chuckling.

Billy Bob Thornton plays a great Howard D. Doyle, of Doyle Oil (the name!), and there are lots of great performances and good scenes.  It wraps up nicely too.

How could anyone not like this movie?  I've seen a lot of Cohen Bros movies and in my humble opinion, this has to be one of their best.  Better than Barton Fink, a lot better than the not so Great Lebbowski, better than Blood Simple.  If I was gonna recommend a Cohen Bros movies, this would be right up there with Fargo and O Brother.  Obviously not dark like ""Fargo"", or with as grand a scope as ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"", giving ""Intolerable Cruelty"" anything less than 5 stars is intolerable cruelty!

So Zeta-Jones decides to get her money the old fashioned way. Marrying a rich man and then divorcing him. ; )

Unfortunately, it seems like the only people who haven't heard about it are the Coen brothers. Therefore, the bad news is that most of the plot is entirely implausible as it doesn't matter who cheated on whom or what they did during the relationship. That being said I still found Intolerable Cruelty to be tremendously enjoyable and fun to watch. Yes, it is a step down for the Coen brothers who have produced the greatest movies of the past two decades this side of Martin Scorsese. Certainly it is no Miller's Crossing but what else could be? Particularly provocative is its take on gold digging women which is very politically correct as it shows Zeta-Jones and her clique to be parasites and systematic exploiters of men. This take on male-female relations (at that particular socio-economic level) is rife with truth and far truer than the politically correct precept that women are victims. Actually, we find that these ladies to be quite empowered even if it is in the fashion of Bluebeard. The movie is a convincing reproduction of real life at the psychological, as opposed to legal, level which is another reason why I must recommend it. As for Clooney, he's absolutely excellent here.

Unfortunately, that is about as far as it gets, as the cast cannot undo what has been done by a screenplay that is seriously flawed, due to its inability to decide what type of film it should be. Unfortunately, it looks as if the director could not make up his mind either, producing a film that is neither fish nor fowl.

At first, I thought that it would be a screwball type of comedy, with George Clooney in the role that would have gone to Cary Grant in the golden age of filmmaking. Then, it seems to take another direction altogether, as if it were supposed to be a romantic comedy with a dark side or simply satire gone awry. Who knows? The Coen brothers surely don't. The film lacks a total surety of identity that kills it, despite the stellar cast. It is a flop, pure and simple.

The plot line is a fairly basic one. It is about a slick, greedy and grasping, unscrupulous matrimonial attorney (George Clooney), the kind that gives all lawyers a bad name, and a greedy and grasping gold digging beauty (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives all beautiful women a bad name. Their paths cross, and the chase is on. Unfortunately, the viewer does not give a rat's behind about either one of them. There is nothing that would ingratiate them to the viewer, due to the two dimensional, leaden screenplay to nowhere in which laughs are few and far between.

The supporting cast is fun too:  Geoffrey Rush as an egotistical soap opera producer; Billy Bob Thornton as Jones' oil millionaire catch; Edward Hermann as a railroad loving philanderer; Cedric the Entertainer as a raspy private eye; and Richard Jenkins as Jones' bumbling attorney.

I am guessing that Micheal Douglas watched it and millions of young girls who like young Mr. Clooney watched it, maybe even some as young as H.S. freshwomen.

1544131,2,B00005JMET,"INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is oddly tepid fare from the Joel and Ethan Coen, the siblings responsible so many hilariously quirky comedies (FARGO; O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?; THE BIG LEBOWSKI; RAISING ARIZONA). All the elements for a good, cynical screwball comedy seem to be in place here, so it's difficult to tell exactly where things went wrong.

Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a successful and ruthless divorce attorney who meets his match in the beautiful and equally ruthless divorcee Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), accumulator of wealthy spouses. When romantic sparks fly between them, both find their feelings of venerability more than a little unsettling; love may be in the air, but so is the strong stench of distrust.

One of the biggest problems with the film is that sparks DON'T fly between Clooney and Zeta-Jones. Both have strong personalities and both possess a keen sense of comic timing, so why the serious disconnect? Perhaps it's the structure of the script: There's one con game too many perpetrated, and since we can't take anything on face value, their resultant romance never seems credible. A parade of comic eccentrics-including a chatterbox millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), a cuckolded husband (Geoffrey Rush), a low-rent divorce attorney (Cedric the Entertainer), and Jones' philandering ex (Edward Herrmann)-march through the plot at various intervals. Most of these supporting turns come across as desperate attempts to enliven the proceedings; although all of the actors are adept farceurs, they're handed material unworthy of their abilities. Only during its final act, with the introduction of an asthmatic hit man (Irwin Keyes), does the film achieve the goofy gusto prevalent in the Coens' other work.

INTOLERABLE CRUELTY always seems to be within pouncing distance of great farce, yet it never really connects. The results are not intolerable, just curiously uninvolving.",1132876800,3,1915,5.419463087248322

1544300,3,B00005JMET,"Joel and Ethan Coen may not be cinematic messiahs, but they sure can be very naughty boys! Movieland's bad lads have largely ignored the Hollywood monster since their 1984 debut, Blood Simple, but this collaboration with Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer represent them looking fulsomely into the mouth of the beast. Their movies have spanned every genre, from farce to film noire, wrestling any number of sacred cows to the ground on their travels. Intolerable Cruelty is just another experiment - this time into the world of mainstream movies and the theme of love and divorce in our times.

Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a slick, successful divorce lawyer to the rich and faithless. In between dental appointments to maintain his pearly bite, he manipulates the legal process to assist his philandering clients in wriggling out of their fiscal responsibilities - for a handsome fee of course. His latest client is the outrageously wealthy Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) whose fetish for choo-choo trains extends rather further than just watching toys go 'round a little track. His wife Marylin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has hired the hyperactive filming detective, Gus (Cedric the Entertainer) to catch his fleshy high jinks, and now, armed with the evidence, she plans to ""nail his ass"" (as Gus so flamboyantly describes it.) Her plan is elegantly simple - to sue Rex, play the damning tape as evidence in court, collect a phenomenal alimony, then quietly enjoy her luxurious independence. There's just one problem....Massey.

 Now, we know Massey must be a professional, because in spite of his obvious ardent attraction to the imminently ex Mrs Rexroth, he still manages a full scale victory for his locophilic client. With her original plans in tatters, poor Marylin has to lure another poor mogul into her web. Enter magnate Howard D. Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton). Having hoped that divorce proceedings would have cleared a path for his own intentions, Massey implores Marylin to enlist him as her attorney. She instead favours her previous lawyer (Six Feet Under's Richard Jenkins), although she does nothing to discourage Massey's romantic overtures.

The paths of our two protagonists continue to cross and weave, leading inevitably to their ultimate entanglement. But, of course, nothing is as it seems, and their hidden agendas and duplicitous tactics threaten disaster for all concerned.

So, does it work? Well, kind of - it rather depends on your expectation of a Coen film. Clooney virtually modernises his role of Everett in O Brother, Where Art Thou, with his foppish ways and glib verbosity. It appears he relishes the opportunity to display his range of physical comedy, his self-deprecating manner just barely keeping his performance from toppling completely into slapstick. As a duo, he and Zeta-Jones work very well together - their comic rhythms work in excellent syncopation, and their wit and intelligence match and complement each other. Zeta-Jones' portrayal of Marylin is well-pitched and honed. Her performance relies on more than a ""va-va-voom"" factor - it demonstrates a knowing intelligence and an almost feline hint of danger that keeps her multidimensional and interesting. The rapport between these two leads results in the delivery of some deliciously wicked dialogue, and there is more than one crackle of electricity between the pair.

The storyline itself is a little variable, oscillating from standard commercial plotlines to sparks of Coenesque mayhem. These two opposing elements have a tendency to cancel each other out somewhat, which will probably leave those who loved such films as Down With Love, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days feeling rather disenfranchised, and Coen devotees feeling as if they've just been dipped in sugar and thrown to the thespians.

And therein lies the major challenge with this film. It's liable to leave a commercial audience a little unsettled, and a Coen admirer a little unsatisfied. Perhaps we could describe it as a ""Coen film with trainer wheels"" - not the full flight package, but enough to get you started.

The production levels are very high - everything is very glossy and glorious, and the support actors are all consummately wonderful. It's actually really rather a hoot, as long as you don't expect too much.",1104796800,2,4300,5.185878962536023

There are enough one-liners in this movie delivered with wit and levity that you are reminded of the smart romantic comedies of the 1940s.  Clooney is perfect as a sleazy divorce lawyer who falls for the maneater Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Zeta-Jones is at her element as a glamorous but crafty woman who married for fortune.

The subject of divorce has been beaten to death and not a very funny subject matter when one really thinks about it.  The fact that the film is about rich people going through a divorce is even more suspect.  However, the performances and screwball-type comedy/script saves the film from sinking.  George Clooney is especially good in his comedic performance as the Divorce Lawyer, Miles Massey. Clooney's deliberate feat of overacting layered with double takes and eye-popping facial expressions are pretty funny  as it gives a sharp contrast to his smooth and handsome exterior. Catherine Zeta Jones as Marylin Rexroth is cool, unaffecting and just an eyeful to look at. Both characters play a cat-and-mouse game of love, swindling, and deceit. The support cast is equally hilarious to keep it interesting with Geoffrey Rush as Donovan Donnell and Cedric the Entertainer as Gus Petch.  One outstanding and hilarious character is Freddy Bender played by Richard Jenkins.  He plays Massey's/Clooney co-lawyer at the firm Massey works at. He matches Clooney with the facial expressions except he cries a lot more than Clooney's character.  Had the film been a major-major hit, the continuous line of leaving oneself ""exposed"" might have been added to the American lexicon of catch-phrases. Overall, a decent screwball comedy that is helped by a funny script,a great support cast, a funny and hilarious performance by George Clooney, and eye-candy in the form of Catherine-Zeta Jones.",1101686400,,1610,5.237354085603113

George Clooney (From Dusk Till Dawn, Tv's E.R.) plays a successful jittery lawyer who falls for Jones. Meanwhile Jones marries Billy Bob Thorton (Friday Night Lights, Armageddon) and sortly after they do Clooney and Jones decide to marry each other and I know my review is sort of confusing but this is what I am typing. Soon after Jones and Clooney marry, Clooney figures out something and has an Wheezy Joe go and kill Jones but it back fires and Wheezy Jones dies. It was all crazy and in a blur but all the actors give top notch performances, especially by Clooney, Cedric and Jones. This is written by Ethan and Joel Cohen but directed by Joel. This is basically what you'd expect from a Cohen Brother movie...wacky characters and situations. Clooney seems like he's playing his figgidy O Brother Where Art Thou? character in some places. Jones is just hot. Also starring Richard Jenkins (Changing Lanes, Say It Isnt So) and if you watch closely when they show Billy Bob Thorton in that doctor drama, the other doctor next to him is Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead Franchise) in an unbilled cameo. Bottom line: Intolerable Cruelty is a kooky Cohen brother movie but it isn't their best. The old lawyer guy hooked up to those respirators was a hoot. Best Line would have to be Cedric The Entertainer's ""Im gonna nail ya in the ass"" quote and the game show at the end made up of the same name was funny as well.",1096156800,,1834,4.54380664652568

1544411,5,B00005JMET,"Entirely, this movie is so funny and hilarious. The comedy scene by Geoffrey Rush is a good start for such movie. I enjoyed the movie from the very beginning. The another funny part is when Cedric is up to his ass-nailing job. The phrase ' I'm gonna nail yo' ass' is great in this movie to show exactly what he's doing. The part where Wheezy Joe(Irwin) try to shoot Miles Massey by using his asthma spray instead of the gun without himself realizing it is also another great part of comedy in this movie which makes me laugh endlessly while watching it. Well, such insident wouldn't happen in the real world for sure. Besides the funny part, the romance part is as well fantastic. Catherine Zeta-Jones and George Clooney fit in perfectly in this movie. They play the role of two highly social-ranked people in this movie. The way Catherine speaks makes her a charming women and Clooney expresses much self-confident in his dialogue. He managed to potray as a romantic divorce attorney like what he supposed to be. Clooney's line is outstanding especially in the court and while having a talk with Catherine's(Marylin) attorney. Personally, I think is good for Clooney to act in a romance-comedy movie as a well-behaved character(attorney) after all his movies where he potrays as a robber , kidnapper or a swindler( Out Of Sight, Dusk Till Dawn, Ocean""s Eleven). I was amazed when he speaks  to Catherine(Marylin) in literally lines(poem recitation) during the court session. Those lines are so nice and it holds the true meaning of what he's actually speaking. Catherine then also reply back in beatiful poetic verse which I admired. Overall, the story line of this movie is good with a fine plot. It shows the ups and downs of the two main character, Clooney(Miles Massey) and Catherine(Marylin Rexroth)as the movie goes on. The ending is as well wonderful. Miles(Clooney) stills willing to be with Marylin(Catherine) after all what they had been through( you stab my back and I stab yours)kind an incident really touched me. This ending gives the feeling of true love and romance despite the swindling of each other feeling. I must admit. It is a very good ending. The sondtrack of this movie is also not bad.

The Coen Brothers normally bring magic and obscurity to the screen in their movies but this film is sadly lacking much originality. The story revolves around sneaky, greedy lawyers and gold-digger Hollywood wives who try to outdo one another all for a little cash. It isn't a story deeply thought out or highly imaginative as I suspect the same story has been told over and over again by many other filmmakers with less of a gift for a gag.

George Clooney only added some pretty white choppers and a decent face to the screen. His character is shallow and not very funny, Clooney tried, but nothing happened in my opinion. Catherine Zeta-Jones comes across somehow too familiar as the vain and money hungry Hollywood wife bent on marriage and divorce one too many times. In a land filled with Botok, silicon, and far too much time you would have thought something funny could have been found to talk about. The bright spots in the film are offered by Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Cedric (the Entertainer) as sidekicks to the pretty regulars. The Coen Brothers would have fared better leaving the pretty out and adding a little more ugly and then maybe this film would be somehow tolerable to get through.",1094515200,3,1353,4.676470588235294
1544413,3,B00005JMET,"Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a ruthless divorce lawyer and Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones) is an equally ruthless gold-digging wife in this Coen Brothers take on the screwball comedy genre. The film takes place in a slick, shiny and heartless Los Angeles. In the old thirties comedies, there was always an element of humorous class confrontation (and sympathy for losers) that gave the films an edge. There's not enough of that populist sympathy here. If we knew a little bit why Miles and Marilyn were so driven (Miles seems to have a father problem, but we never really learn anything about Marilyn) it could put their behavior into perspective.

The inclusion of an African-American detective is interesting, but Miles (and the film) treat him dismissively. Miles meets him for lunch in a dingy diner instead of one of the glossier restaurants we see in the film. In the screwball genre, this should be the scene where we see the better, decent side of Miles; we should see that he is a man of the people. But in this film, the diner, usually a place of populist wisdom, (and a handy cinematic counterpoint to the empty values of the wealthy characters), is dismissed and ridiculed. If Miles had met the detective in an upscale restaurant (and taken Marilyn to the diner), that would have told us something about his inborn decency despite his privileged background. Then we would have really been on his side. And if we were given an inkling of why Marilyn is so money-hungry, we might have more sympathy for her. This film lacks the underlying empathy for ordinary people that the great comedies had beneath their slick facades. This empathy is in the other Coen Brothers films, so it's disappointing not to see it here.",1089504000,,1736,4.806020066889632

Unfortunately, that is about as far as it gets, as the cast cannot undo what has been done by a screenplay that is seriously flawed, due to its inability to decide what type of film it should be. Unfortunately, it looks as if the director could not make up his mind either, producing a film that is neither fish nor fowl.
At first, I thought that it would be a screwball type of comedy, with George Clooney in the role that would have gone to Cary Grant in the golden age of filmmaking.  Then, it seems to take another direction altogether, as if it were supposed to be a romantic comedy with a dark side or simply satire gone awry. Who knows? The Coen brothers surely don't. The film lacks a total surety of identity that kills it, despite the stellar cast. It is a flop, pure and simple.
The plot line is a fairly basic one. It is  about a slick, greedy and grasping, unscrupulous matrimonial attorney (George Clooney), the kind that gives all lawyers a bad name, and a greedy and grasping gold digging beauty (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives all beautiful women a bad name. Their paths cross, and the chase is on. Unfortunately, the viewer does not give a rat's behind about either one of them. There is nothing that would ingratiate them to the viewer, due to the two dimensional, leaden screenplay to nowhere in which laughs are few and far between.
If you are a die hard Coen brothers fan, as I am, do yourself a favor and, rather than buy this film, rent it first. You will thank me for this advice, once you have seen this film.",1085875200,2,1713,4.316770186335404

The bad news is that Zeta-Jones is nothing more than a beautiful statue (definitely not one of the best actresses on the planet), as well as the film having no real sense of structure.

Miles Massey (Clooney) is a supremely successful divorce attorney who wins impossible settlements for his clients while crushing the other side without regard to facts, truth, or even ethics.

What she does about that crushing experience is the rest of the movie, which I can't talk about here.
 In spite of the virtues the movie has in performance, it lacks some sparkle in the screenplay.

In short, the Coens are pulling punches when they shouldn't, relying on the ""stars"" of the film, and instead they give us nothing but a shallow imitation of the 40s screwball comedy.
George Clooney plays the hero of the romantic comedy, the divorce lawyer who fell for Catherine Zeta-Jones's character who takes advantage of now (in)famous pre-naptial agreements to get more money.  And of course, they fight each other at first, in and out of the court, and then fall in love perhaps, but that obligatory process is no problem if these two stars have the same kind of sweet, natural charm as Cary Grant.
But sorry, I see none here, and George Clooney is the same old Clooney speaking with the lopsided head; and Ms. Zeta-Jones is no fun, who leaves nothing but an impression that after all she cannot act, literally equating the watching experience of her with the idea ""Intolerable Cruelty.""
The greatest mistake is that the film refuses to question or make fun of these ""pre-naps.""  By doing so, the men and women here (especially the latter) start to look unnaturally greedy.  And after all, when it's about rich people trying to deceive each other, why should we care?  We cannot relate to the characters who should be more charming and more human.  They are preoccupied with these pre-nap contracts which sound to many of us as remote as the big swimming pool depicted in this film, which makes the whole story ridiculous.

Maybe people didn't like this one as much because three other guys helped with the script [that includes story credit]. But it's obvious that this is a Coen Bro's film just by listening to the style of humor in it. The over all style of the film gives off that whole feel of one of their films.

George Clooney once again reunites with the bro's on this one. I feel he stole the show with his prefomance in this one. Also Catherine did an excellent job on this one. The entire cast did great jobs in this film. I pearsonally was not dissapointed with this film at all. I will eventually review this at length, but for now.........",1082332800,,763,4.335664335664336
1544666,4,B00005JMET,"Can you deal with the Coen Brothers hitting the mainstream? If yes, you will probably like this movie. If not, you may be a bit dissapointed. This isn't my favorite Coen brothers movie, but it is worth seeing.  It has a lot of the trademark Coen oddities in characters, dialogue, wit, and dark, biting humor, but it moves into a realm left relatively untouched by the Coen's by introducing more elements of the traditional romantic comedy than seen in their previous works. Not to mention the casting of high profile stars (though I seem to remember a film of theirs starring Holly Hunter and Nicholas Cage...hmmm) and some transparency in plotline. That being said...I liked the film. It was one that I had no expectations of and found myself having fun watching it. If you want a straight up Coen Brothers original this won't be the movie for you. If you want a romantic comedy that has obviously been crafted by the masters and are willing to let some things go with regards to style points...you'll really enjoy this movie.",1082073600,,1027,4.705555555555556
1544667,3,B00005JMET,"While on the surface containing all the elements for a good cinematic experience (George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, the Coen Brothers, Cedric The Entertainer, etc.), Intolerable Cruelty suffers from the most basic problem, namely that it's so unsure of what kind of movie it's supposed to be that it ends up failing, for the most part, across the board.
At first it would seem to be an update of the classic screwball comedy, given the setup of Clooney as THE divorce attorney and Zeta-Jones as a woman who chooses her husbands by their bank accounts.  There is a lot of homage to those films and Clooney and Zeta-Jones seem up to the task, but then the film takes a somewhat darker turn and loses a ton of steam.  I don't know if I've ever seen a hybrid black comedy/screwball but this isn't it.  They try, but they don't succeed.
The script is also haphazard.  I may be wrong, but I believe this is the first film the Coens have written in conjunction with another writing team and from a story not original to them.  It shows.  It's not quite convoluted, and like any Coen film there are little quirks and tricks that show up along the way, but there are things that just don't seem to have any purpose.  The opening sequence with Geoffrey Rush is funny, but has no relevance to the rest of the plot save for one very, very brief moment in the middle and another at the end.
There are, however, some redeeming qualities.  As with most Coen films, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is phenomenal.  There are several very funny slapstick moments, most involving Clooney, and Billy Bob Thornton has a funny part.  Zeta-Jones seems to play the put-upon scheming tough-as-nails type well but she actually seems to suffer next to Clooney's mugging and broad comedic gestures.
Overall it gets 3 stars for the sheer star power of Clooney and Zeta-Jones, for the effort to revive the screwball genre, and because the Coens at least keep things interesting, if not always entertaining.",1081382400,15,1984,4.708092485549133
1544668,4,B00005JMET,"The Coen brothers prove they can turn in a crowd-pleasing genre movie that's not a film noir (though it gently hints and pushes just enough in those - and many other - directions to remind you how much darker they could have twisted given another mood). Still retaining enough trademark wicked humour at the expense of its unknowing characters (specifically the marital losers played by Ed Begley Jr, Geoffrey Rush and a very game Billy Bob Thornton) to keep you reminded of their sibling brand, the flm nevertheless also proves thoroughly irresistable by most (low) mainstream expeectations. As rom-coms go, this is deliberately Cary Grant territory, with the Coens deliberately ignoring the Nora Ephron and Richard Curtis sensibilities that have predominantly twin-streamed through romantic comedies since When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Rather, whilst directly enticing this mainstream used to the tiring Ephron menu, the always appealing Curtis fare and the increasingly less sharp Woody Allen outputs, the Coens bravely dare to offer us a taste of something a little rarer, a little more exotic and a little more mischievous - a high-end sophisticated rom-com driven alernatively by challenging combinations of high and low wit, sparkling dialogue and  outright venom. The result is an aristocratic Hollywood concoction, with Clooney particularly on top form - once again proving his particular brand of guy charisma irresistably infectious. Intolerable Cruelty is to the mostly forgotten Golden Age of Hollywood rom-coms what Kill Bill is to the action movies of the 70s - stirring happy hints and reminders less of specific movies you can name than broad cinematic moods and pleasures you once treasured. An all-round class act - and spritely antidote to the dour, sluggish Man Who Wasn' t There.",1081209600,,1825,5.2714776632302405

Even lesser Cohen Brothers's movies (""Miller's Crossing"", for example) still have something to recommend them, and are still usually worth seeing at least once. This movie,however,is not.
George Clooney is a slicker-than-snot divorce attorney. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a cheated-on wife who tries to take her
wealthy husband (Edward Herrmann) to the cleaners. Thanks to Clooney, she loses. But, this being a romantic comedy, Clooney falls for her while she desires revenge.
You couldn't ask for better leads than Clooney and Zeta-Jones. But the boneheaded script does not work. The two lead characters spend most of the film trying to out-con each other. Most of the jokes seem to be about torn-up prenups. We don't care if the two leads end up together, because all they do is try to outwit each other, with not very funny results.
The cast makes it bearable, but even Clooney is reduced to ""screaming in panic"" scenes by the film's end.
The movie is made uneven by adding in quirky supporting characters, but the actors involved (Billy Bob Thornton, Cedric the Entertainer, Geoffrey Rush, even Julia Duffy) all go to waste in underwritten roles. Perhaps next time, the Cohens should not team on the script with outside writers.",1081123200,,1339,5.090909090909091
1544837,3,B00005JMET,"This is not one of the Coen Brothers' stronger efforts, but it's still watchable. The storyline is more predictable than in most of their movies, although there are a few twists along the way.  Only two scenes - the courtroom sequence and the showdown with Wheezy Joe - reach the inspired level of warped humor that is the Coens' hallmark. And Miles' speech to the NOMAN convention is a complete waste of time.
The cast members all do a decent job. Clooney is charming; Zeta-Jones is gorgeous; Herrmann, Rush, Cedric and Thornton all come through with workmanlike performances. But for the most part, there's little ""zing"" and you don't really care much about the outcome.
I went back and forth between three stars and four on this. I really wish Amazon allowed half-star ratings, so I could give it 3.5 stars.",1081036800,,810,4.74468085106383

 This is George Clooney's second go around with the brothers Coen, and it is just as good as O Brother Where Art Thou (that's saying something) Clooney portrays a greedy, rich, braggadocio lawyer, who's specialty prenuptial has never been broken. His fancy is caught by Catherine Zeta Jones's character, a heartless gold digger, who in the end falls in love for real.
 Also entwined in this flick are Cedric the Entertainer and Billy Bob Thornton, with pieces one can hardly call cameos. Expect surprises and delicious plot turns every minute, expect great acting from George Clooney, but most of all, don't expect that by doing a romantic comedy the Coen bro's have sold out.

1544840,4,B00005JMET,"The zany relationship between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the Coen Brothers' 'Intolerable Cruelty' never really sparks, and that's a big flaw in a film that is meant to revive the Cary Grant-like screwball romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.
That's not saying that 'Cruelty' isn't a guilty pleasure. Clooney shows great comedic chops here: Grant-like double takes in court; a ""Who's On First"" schtick with sidekick Wrigley (Paul Adelstein). Asked by their client if they've ""ever sat before the judge before,"" the two respond ""No, we sit after the judge."" This routine goes on for a minute or two, the poker-faced duo patiently explaining to a beffudled client the order of sitting. Very funny stuff.
As for Catherine Zeta-Jones, she looks incredible here, but she's not really given a lot of dimension by the script. I feel like she maximized what she was given to work with.
It's the top-notch supporting cast that really makes 'Cruelty' work. Most notably:
a. The before mentioned Paul Adelstein as Miles Massey aide-de-camp Wrigley.
b. Edward Herrmann as Zeta-Jones' soon-to-be-ex-husband Rex Rexroth - this is a role that really turns Herrmann's stuffy FDR-like image on his head. He's excellent here as a flummoxed ex with an odd train fetish.
c. Cedric the Entertainer as detective/videographer Gus Petch - his catchphrase will have you laughing as will his little piece on the importance of staying in shape.
d. Geoffrey Rush does an extended cameo at the beginning as a successful TV producer...a nice little appearance at the end teams him up unexpectedly with Cedric's Petch.
e. Richard Jenkins - supporting player extraordinaire (check him out in 'Flirting With Disaster') excels as Massey's courtroom adversary Freddy Bender.
f. Billy Bob Thortnon is flat-out great as Zeta-Jones 'husband' #2 Howard Doyle. I don't know what it is about Billy Bob - the smaller the role, the better he is. [Check out his mesmerizing turn in ""Love Actually.""] Upon meeting Clooney, he goes into this little bit (I can't recall *how* he ended up here, which is part of the fun) about how he was an Aggie, and he used to ""play a little tight end for A&M"" and he was successful because he could ""squirt through the line."" I don't know if he ad-libbed that stuff, if the Coen brothers wrote it or what, but it's brilliantly delivered. It's completely apropos of nothing at the time, which - you realize later - is exactly the point. Here's to more Billy Bob.
I also enjoyed the references to the ""Massey Pre-Nup."" As a plot device, this yielded a lot of yuks - especially when Thornton's Doyle eats a copy with barbeque sauce - and nice little swerves in the story line. Once the nature of the pre-nup is defined, the direction of the film pivots back and forth depending on who is perceived to have the Massey-defined 'advantage.' The constant reference to the 'Massey Pre-Nup' reminded me a lot of the Steve Martin classic 'Man With Two Brains' and Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr's references to his renowned 'Cranial Screw Top' brain surgery.",1080518400,,3045,4.903100775193798

I really think the movie started out well. But it lost steam about halfway through when Miles begins to truly fall for Marilyn. After that, Mile's character transforms abruptly, and I found the transformation unbelievable. Also, I thought Marilyn was rather an unsympathetic character. Her motives were worse than Miles' in my opinion. And I felt no real chemistry between her and Clooney.

He meets Catherine Zeta-Jones in a divorce case, and instantly and completely falls head over heels for her (and what lawyer wouldn't).  Even though he knows she is going to try to get his money, he thinks he has outsmarted her and pursues her anyway.  The plot twists and turns from there.  But it isn't the plot that makes this movie funny, it's the little things.  You've got to pay attention!  For example, when George Clooney gets married, the priest lists his law firm after his name.  This cracked me up.  Plus, the expressions on George Clooney's face are really funny, like his role in ""Brother, Where Art Thou?""  The characters are all somewhat exaggerated, and this separates ""Intolerable Cruelty"" from your average comedy.  This movie relies on a pretty brutal form of humor, in the same vein but not as rough as ""The Fortune Cookie.""  If you're able to let go of people being nice to each other, you'll be in the right mood for ""Intolerable Cruelty.""

Ok, so it's not desperately bad, but is it just me or does this film seem like a completely pointless hour and a half? This is a romantic comedy without any romance, and any comedy. One of those films with such great potential, that falls down on a poor script that can barely manage some average 'smile' humour, and a few trite speeches about love and life that make you cringe rather than shed a tear. The film basically centres on a man-eating divorcee out for wealth and independence and a sharp divorce lawyer bored of money and independence who wants more from his life. They meet, some stuff happens, you're never sure who's doing who over, and who has the upper hand, and then they fall in love. Or do they? Etc etc. I really wanted to like this film and thought it had a lot of potential, but somehow it just doesn't work.

1544948,3,B00005JMET,"Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a charming but unscrupulous Hollywood divorce lawyer famous for obtaining lucrative settlements for not-so-innocent clients and leaving his opponents poverty-stricken. One such opponent was Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the scheming wife of a childish but fabulously wealthy industrialist. Determined not to be beaten twice, Marilyn turns to Miles for legal assistance with her second marriage, and the two begin to find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.

""Intolerable Cruelty"" is the Coen brothers' most mainstream fair yet. Officially, Joel directed, and Ethan produced, as usual. The brothers co-wrote the film with Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" lacks the black humor of most Coen brothers' comedies. Instead, it's a screwball comedy that tries to be clever. George Clooney is as charismatic as ever, even in the screwball routines. Catherine Zeta-Jones is lovely and seductive and has a nice wardrobe, but her character is a little flat. She is intended to be a match for Miles Massey's machinations, but we really don't see it. She seems more like a straightforward gold-digger than a clever comic femme fatale. And she never comes across as threatening in any way. More lines would have given her the opportunity to demonstrate her wit and convince us that Miles would really fall for this woman. The film has an all-star supporting cast, which is universally terrific. Billy Bob Thorton is irresistible as Marilyn's  incurably garrulous second husband. Jonathan Hadary is hilarious as the Baron Krauss Von Espy, a witness at Marilyn's divorce hearing. Other notable supporting contributions include: Geoffrey Rush as one Miles' defeated courtroom opponents, Cedric the Entertainer as a private investigator specializing in compromising videos, Julia Duffy as a filthy rich Beverly Hills divorcee, and Edward Herrmann as Marilyn's first husband. The problems with the film are that Marilyn seems underwritten and not especially clever, the jokes are a little tired, and the film has a few too many acts. So, in spite of its undeniably attractive stars and excellent supporting cast, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" just isn't very funny -with the notable exception of the Baron's courtroom appearance. It's not biting enough to be good satire. Nor is it successful in generating the lighthearted charm of early romantic comedies to which it seems to aspire.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled ""A Look Inside Intolerable Cruelty"", a featurette on the film's wardrobe by Costume Designer Mary Zophres, outtakes, written bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The making-of documentary contains interviews with the film's actors, the Coen brothers, and producer Brain Glazier. It's long, but it actually doesn't say much. ""The Wardrobe"" featurette is a nice addition for those interested in film fashion. Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, and English. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.

Both George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones always look fantastic (or comedically awful), always speak with glittering words, and always know they will wind up together. This, however, doesn't stop them from creating obstacles for themselves.
While they plot each other's financial doom, it soon becomes apparent that these plots are excuses to be near each other. Because Clooney needs to search Zeta-Jones's house, he invites her to dinner under romantic pretenses. As Zeta-Jones uses Clooney for her own machinations, he admits that she ""fascinates him"" with adoration for her treachery and for her.
Assisting the two stars as the grapple with each other is a small universe of scene-stealing characters: Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy who is well... the Baron, ""the hammer"" Gus Petch, hapless attorney Freddy Bender, Texas A&M alumnus Howard D.

O.k., so I didn't necessarily love ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" but it does qualify as a hit for me.

I could see Cary Grant and Irene Dunne doing this film, or William Powell and Myrna Loy.
I think George Clooney is a pretty bland actor, but I can admit that he's got charm, which is all this role really calls for.  Catherine Zeta-Jones will probably reveal herself to be a fairly limited actress by the time all is said and done, but she's sexy as hell, which is all HER role really calls for.

Perhaps it is the acting which falls short on the delivery of the before mentioned quirkiness, somewhat reminiscent of ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" in which the odd ball characters didn't exactly stray too far into the desired odd ball territory.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty, catty, shallow, funny enough, and ultimately replacable. Casting a more endearing woman might have helped the romantic side of things, because it is too easy to disbelieve her genuineness. George Clooney on the other hand is extremely funny and self-deprecating (his relationship with his teeth is particularly funny). He is as shallow as Catherine's character, but much more likable, which keeps the film entertaining.
The art direction is charactertistic Coen Bros. - dark, but richly colored, making for a farcical ambience throughout. The jokes are wicked and clever as usual.

OK, Catherine Zeta-Jones is mostly on message, and Billy Bob Thornton gets into the right spirit. But otherwise the characters are thin (or just plain annoying) and the actors overcompensate by playing up the offbeat, perhaps thinking that quirkiness is all it takes to make a Coen brothers movie.  The tone here is set by Clooney, who can't seem to decide whether he's in The Philadelphia Story or O Brother Where Art Thou?  His broad touches might work better if this were a funnier movie, but here he's just trying too hard.

Though they wrote it - or at least punched it up - this script doesn't do the Coen brothers right.  Alas, they seem to know it, and so do their performers.",1078099200,,902,4.6835443037974684

There is a lot that happens beneath the average movie watcher's radar here (not a slam of movie watchers, I wish I were less critical of movies I watch and I wish I could just sit back and enjoy them). The movie is very good and is VERY Coen Brothers.
If you're expecting a War of Roses movie, you'll like this better than you expect. If you're expecting a ha-ha funny movie, you'll be disappointed.
The best part of the movie is watching the characters par, dance, jab, avoid, and complement each other throughout the scenes.

Instead of more subtle humor, which might have helped this movie, the viewers are hit over the head with the silly slapstick.
It was so boring, so absurd, and the only good chemistry between Marilyn and Miles was in the scenes that were shown in the previews. The Coen brothers sure laid an egg this time around!

Being the Cohen Brothers fan that I am, I quickly suggested this, since I missed it when it was in the theater. I don't know if it was the dinner or the wine, but she quickly nodded off, leaving me to catch this one on my own. I was disappointed, especially since she really like 'Fargo' and 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou?'
Make no mistake, from the opening credits with 'Suspicious Minds'  overlayed, to Billy Bob Thorton in a daytime drama, this is unmistakably Coen. It has that Big Lebowski feel, a light hearted story with deeper meaning. In this case, it's the lovely interplay between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Clooney plays a high powered divorce lawyer, while Zeta Jones plays a socialite that jumps from man to man to increase her fortune. Obviously, their paths cross. Clooney is 'fascinated' by Zeta Jones, and they eventually hook up. This movie really deals with the question of whether love is more important than money, and the nature of conquest. It's difficult to justify this being a great movie without giving too much of the plot away, but it's really worth your hour and 40 minutes. Just remember that the Coens are excellent story tellers, both as writers and with cinematography. So you get a wonderful tale with some wonderful imagery.

It wasn't quite up to the chemistry between Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"", for example, although I found myself thinking of Cary Grant as I watched Clooney.  Zeta-Jones is surely a modern classic as a leading lady in film.  They both did their roles justice in this movie.
As for the plot, if one is willing to relax and go along for the ride, it is very entertaining.  Lots of banter, some good humorous dialogue and situations, and a couple of excellent characters played by the leads.  This isn't one of the Coen's best films by any means.  Compared to many of their other films, it doesn't seem to amount to much.  Compared to many other things out there which pass for entertainment, this movie is excellent.

Fans of the Coen Brothers will instantly love this fast paced, witty and surreal piece of cinematic genius, brilliantly directed, fantastically scripted and incredibly intelligent.  While the idea of Clooney and Zeta-Jones fogging up the screen in a romantic comedy turned me off so much that I missed this in the cinema, now I've seen it I can't believe I had so little faith in Joel and Ethan.  The Coen's didn't write the story, so this is sadly no Big Lebowski or Fargo, and some of the characters are a tad unsubtle (Cedric the Entertainer's private dick, the half-dead head lawyer and Clooney's sidekick come to mind) but they did have a hand in the screenplay, and therefore the dialogue sparkles with the typical Coen shine.  I think the best scene for this is during Zeta-Jones' first divorce, as Clooney, his sidekick and this Client, in strained whispers, discuss their experience with the Judge (""Have you sat before this Judge before?"",""No, the Judge sits first..."").  The cockpit scenes in Airport spring to mind...
The plot wriggles and squirms, involves and discards without ever falling into the trap of becoming too slow, sentimental or boring and various recurring jokes and camera shots from other Coen brothers movies will keep the viewer entertained even after the6th or 7th run through.  The only thing that becomes stale is Zeta-Jones' lack of acting ability, but she's so drop-dead gorgeous that it doesn't really matter.

1545250,4,B00005JMET,"I went into Intolerable Cruelty expecting something dull anf fluffy.  Should've known better from a Coen brothers' movie I suppose, because Intolerable Cruelty is actually a lot better than its reception at the box office would have you believe.  The story pits man-eater Catherine Zeta Jones alongside George Clooney, the lawyer who on behalf of her husband, ensured she got nothing from her last divorce settlement.
Clooney is perfect for this kind of role, clearly relishing the opportunity to play the egotistical poser with a hidden soul, delivering lines such as 'That woman fascinates me' with the kind of personality that only he can deliver.  I've never been a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones, but she really sparkles here, particularly with the verbal put-downs and snappy dialogue.
Of course, this being a Coen brothers' film there are a few manic characters along the sidelines, most noticeably Wheezy the assassin, the crazy old man who runs the law firm and most hilariously, Billy Bob Thornton as the second husband.  He alone is worth the admission.  Whilst it seems all too easy to state that this isn't as good as previous Coens' movies such Fargo or The Big Lewbowski, it's still a whole lot better than the majority of romantic fluff out there.  Indeed, even if some of the Coens' crazier elements don't really come off for such a clearly mainstream affair, it's still a very enjoyable ride, and there are a few good laugh-out-loud moments.

Cedric the Entertainer was hardly in it as a private investigator who liked to nail people's behinds.

1545253,2,B00005JMET,"Let me say this first: I love the Coen brothers. Right out of the gate with Blood Simple, they hit the ground running and since then have carved out a niche for themselves as perhaps America's finest filmmakers. They have a signature style that flows easily from one genre to the next, and in my book, they've never even come close to failing.
Until this time. After seeing George Clooney's performance in O, Brother, Where Art Thou?, I was very excited to see him working with the Coens again. To his credit, Clooney is the sole standout in this film that makes attempts at reviving the spirit of some of the greater screwball comedies of the 30's & 40's. Had this been set in those times and filmed in black and white, it would probably have been a much better movie. Catherine Zeta Jones brings her usual nothing to the film, which is hardly surprising. Attractive? Sure. Gorgeous? You betcha. But under the surface, I just don't think there's anyone there.
After ten amazingly original films, I guess the Coens were due to stumble. This is their most mainstream movie by any measure, and it certainly shows why, with previous films, the Coens were always many, many steps above the mainstream. Hopefully this one movie is the extent of their adventures in formula filmmaking, and they'll be back on track from here on out.",1077148800,6,1326,4.670940170940171

This is proof positive that no matter how much star power you have it is still no substitute for good writing. As others before me have pointed out the main characters simply have no chemistry and this is not for a lack of trying. Though they might attempt to exchange smoldering looks the result is flat and utterly uninspiring. How can you feel anything for a money grubbing woman who makes a career out of divorce and an equally shallow but 'savvy' attorney who despite being smitten by his client's wife is still too dumb to see through this transparent plot! The whole time my wife and I watched this disaster we could not help but comment it looked like a movie made by Hollywood insiders for Hollywood insiders. Is this supposed to be some sort of social commentary on Beverly Hills matrimonial life? If so I didn't care before and I still don't care now.,1077148800,2,947,4.479768786127168
1545255,3,B00005JMET,"The Coen brothers have another hit on their hands with the deliciously funny ""Intolerable Cruelty"", and though it may be far from their best work, it is still quite solid. As is usual in their films, all the humour here is pretty dark, and it is the actors, and not the script, that really pull this film above mediocrity in the romanctic comedy genre.
George Clooney continues to amaze me, because he is such a good, quirky actor, that truly embraces every ounce of cheesiness that comes with each of the character that he plays. He is the closest we have now to one of the classic actors of the 40's and 50's. He has the same style and swagger as a Bogart or Gable. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also very good here, showing that her performance in ""Chicago"" was no fluke. She is a solid actress, and she makes the most of her evil character, the often divorced woman who is seeking a huge settlement from all of her husbands. Also exceptional in this film are the smaller roles of Billy Bob Thorton and Geoffrey Rush, who each play their parts like they are having a great time with them, living up the eccentricities to delightful extremes.
The plot here is nothing original, following the same pattern as the standard romantic comedy. Cloonet meets Zeta-Jones, and like the rest of the world, thinks she is beautiful, therefore falling for her. He is the divorce attourney representing one of her husbands, so they begin as enemies before eventually wanting to be together, as it goes. There are the usual hitches and whatnot, so none of the ratings stars are going for the plot.

1545395,2,B00005JMET,"was this a comedy? Was this a romance? Was it a drama? Was it a comedy-romance? Who knows. I'm not even sure. What a horrible movie. From the writing on the DVD case, it sounds more like a romance. But right away the movie seems more like a comedy, then a romance, then a drama...on and on. Now, these elements can be mixed, but there has to be a clear definition, clear boundaries, a clear vision. This movie did not have that. It's very confusing, because some scenes could be read in many different ways. Was the scene supposed to be funny, was it being satirical and making fun of itself, or was it being serious and we were supposed to feel sorry, or pity, or emotion? Who knows. On one hand, the movie wasn't what I thought it was going to be like from the description on the box, however, what it did turn out to be was a paranoid schizophrenia, multiple personality movie. Sure, it had a few funny parts, but most of the time I think you'll just have a puzzled look on your face.
Here's my version of the story. George clooney is the TOP divorce attorney in the US. his clients always win no matter how ridiculous their cases are. His client is caught on video tape having an affair and zeta-jones wants half his worth. Well, she gets nothing, and then marries (PLOT SPOILER) this rich guy who's supposedly richer than rich all in an effort to dupe George Clooney into falling for her. Here's where it really gets wierd.  HUGE PLOT SPOLIER COMMING HERE ----> so she divorces that fake rich guy, gets a zillion dollars (supposedly), then (supposedly) marries clooney and then tells him the next day she's going to divorce him and take half his money and she really wasn't rich afterall blah blah de friggin blah and then she somehow then decides she actually does love clooney and then they end up together. What a crappy movie.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Cedric The Entertainer has a very funny 5 minutes or so in the movie. The part was perfect for him, and that was pretty much the only really funny parts in the movie.
The only thing intolerable and cruel about this was having to watch it. The movie should have been called psycho-money-hungry-hussies and their dirtbag-cheating-scum-husbands, or ""reasons to not get married""",1076976000,2,2280,4.507246376811594

I thought this was a delightful film. Much of the fun comes from the fact that it's a very, very silly story, and much of the humor comes from the cast embracing how silly it is. George Clooney, in particular, makes a great modern-day Cary Grant, dropping pithy comebacks while flashing a grin. It's brain candy, sure, but the very best kind.
The picture quality reflects the colorful, bright nature of the film; unfortunately, the DVD extras aren't so peppy. There are two short, typical featurettes, cast biographies, and outtakes. The Clooney and Zeta-Jones outtakes are quite funny, but two minutes of silent railroad footage are not.

1545397,3,B00005JMET,"The remarkable Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, give us one of their weakest entries in ""Intolerable Cruelty"". I don't blame them. It is the nature of filmmaking. Sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't. This one has its share of entertaining moments, but it's a mere blip on the radar screen compared to other Coen films such as ""Fargo"".
This is the story of high-profile divorce lawyer Miles Massey [George Clooney], author of a famous prenuptial agreement document so strong no one has ever been able to break it. He takes on Marilyn Rexroth [Catherine Zeta-Jones], who is divorcing her husband on the grounds of infidelity. She has the video tapes to prove it, but, unbelievably, Massey wins the case in court for the unfaithful husband. Marilyn is left with nothing, but Massey hasn't seen the last of her. She plots her revenge, which begins by making him fall in love with her.
The problem is that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't involve the audience. Both Massey and Rexroth are unlikable characters, so why should we much care what they do or what happens to them? If the movie is a black comedy, where is the comeuppance the couple deserves? If it is a screwball comedy, where are the redeeming qualities of the characters?

Hudsucker was a parody (or pastiche, if you like the genre to begin with) of forties romantic comedies.  Jennifer Jason Leigh nailed the Katherine Hepburn fast-talking New England sophisticate.  I laughed at Jason Leigh's performance more than I ever did at a Katherine Hepburn movie.
Intolerable Cruelty is set in the present day, but its comedy evokes the Marx brothers of the thirties.  The minor characters are the rich morons (botoxed divorcee, loopy millionaire train enthusiast) that predated Preston Sturges-style pseudo-realism.  Imagine an anorexic Margaret Dumont.  And I would bet money the Coens were trying to make one character (a poodle-carrying European hotel major domo) look like Oscar Levant.
The look of the film (and most of the acting) has a kind of sixties Batman winking at the audience style.  The senior partner in Miles Massey's law firm is a monster with tubes and wires connecting him to the world.  Clooney as Miles strikes poses and jokes even when he's the only person around.  Sometimes it's very funny, but Zeta-Jones plays Marylin Rexroth more straight and that might be why it seems to some that Clooney and Zeta-Jones don't click.
My favorite scenes are when Miles fences with his legal opponents in conferences and in court.  I can hear Groucho's voice twisting people in knots.
Intolerable Cruelty is entertaining, but Joel and Ethan Coen have set the bar so high for themselves with Blood Simple, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and The Man Who Wasn't There that I can't help feeling it was barely worth all the trouble.",1076803200,,1753,5.038062283737024

And certainly the film has its Coen quota of bizarre moments, ludicrous situations, inane but pacy dialogue. You just may find yourself chuckling often, not the audible kind of chuckles, but the generic BubblyMood variety.
Sadly, a horrendously predictable plot underpins the theme -- a gold digger (Zeta Jones) rubs an LA divorce lawyer (Clooney) the wrong way, chemistry fireworks follow, etc etc, until the finale where both realize they were in.....heck, I won't spoil it for you. You'll figure it out if you haven't already.
There is something vaguely disappointing about it all -- a sense that the filmmaking team was resting on their laurels, not following up on the truly inspired creativity that produced such minor miracles as ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona.""

1545402,3,B00005JMET,"The title of the Cohen brothers' latest film Intolerable Cruelty could have been applied to the duo's film ""Barton Fink"". Here the brothers attempt a romantic comedy with dashes of screwball thrown in for good measure. Although ""Intolerable Cruelty"" can't quite stand with the best work the Cohens have done, it's a bright and breezy step away from the really dark humor that has characterized their best work. As usual, though, the duo are still original enough to subvert a number of the genre's cliches. The bottom line, it's entertaining as heck and a pleasant way to spend the evening.
Miles Massey (George Clooney) a seasoned divorce lawyer has finally met his match in the love 'em and leaves 'em Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones). Massey represents Mr. Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) in the divorce . Despite the fact that they are on opposite sides of the fence, Massey and Mrs. Rexroth find an instant attraction and share a cynical outlook on romance and the institution of marriage. We get to watch the two dance around each other expecting betrayal but, in the process, they discover they really were made for each other. Featured witty dialogue, the Cohens' brand of off-beat humor and a number of interesting (Bruce Campbell, Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Julia Duffy), Intolerable Cruelty at times recalls the best work of Preston Sturges and even Alfred Hitchcock's romantic comedy/suspense films. Although it isn't quite up to Sturges, Hitchcock or Lubitsch, it's a huge improvement over the bulk of the formulaic romantic comedies that Hollywood has been force feeding us over the past decade.
Both the lead actors recall romantic comedy stars from the past with their spectacular performances. In the case of Clooney, he reminds me a bit of Cary Grant's breezy performances and Zeta-Jones recalls Grace Kelley's work in Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"". The supporting cast is equally strong and up to the task of trying to revive a genre that has fallen into cliches.
""Intolerable Cruelty"" demonstrates that the Cohen brothers continue to master a wide variety of genres bending each to their artistic vision. While this breezy romantic comedy doesn't rank with their best work, the witty dialogue and inspired performances make the film a worthwhile investment on a Friday or Saturday night.",1076716800,,2319,5.089238845144357

1545404,4,B00005JMET,"It is important to remember that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is a fable, which is the best way of explaining why tearing up a marital pre-nup actually works, whether or not you eat it with barbecue sauce.  This is a world where the only facts that can come out in court are those we do not know; everything else apparently gets forgotten, especially when it would be of some importance in a divorce case.  But this is the world of the Cohen Brothers and we learned a long time ago what that means.
The story of this 2003 film is that divorce lawyer Miles Massey (George Clooney) is ""fascinated"" by Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  But even being fascinated does not stop him from blowing her out of the water when she tries to divorce her husband Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann), nor does going back to the beginning stop her from her plan to marry and divorce a millionaire.  We know that he is good, because Marylin had a video showing Rex cheating on her and it did not do her any good, so the question is why she wants to hire him to draft the famous ironclad Massey Pre-Nup for her next marriage to Texas oil billionaire Howard D. Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton).  Why would a gold-digger like Marylin want a pre-nup?  Stay tuned.
One thing you cannot accuse the Cohens of doing is repeating themselves when they make a comedy.  ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is not like ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Fargo,"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", each of which is funny in its own peculiar way.  It is, in its own weird way, their version of a screwball comedy, except with a lot more bite than you usually get in such films.  The supporting cast has nice performances from Geoffrey Rush, Richard Jenkins, Julia Duffy, Jonathan Hadary, and Cedric the Entertainer, but in the end this film comes down to Clooney and Zeta-Jones, both of whom are actually required to do more than stand there and look good, although she has several scenes that require her to do just that while his eyes widen appreciatively.  Surprisingly these two actually have something in common: they are not sure they still want to be the people they have become and might actually do something about it.  But then, as I said at the start, this movie is a fable.",1076630400,6,2210,4.583756345177665
1545525,4,B00005JMET,"Ahhh Miles Massey, master of the divorce court.  This was simply an amazing piece of acting by Clooney, he took a completely repugnant stereotype of the rich, often vulture-like divorce attorney and made him quite the charming cad who at times we feel absolute pity for.  Of course, he did have quite a foil in Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas (last hyphenation added for my amusement only), who plays the gold-digging Marylin Rexroth (her husbands name of course) that we come to at least respect, if not actually like.
For lovers of the light romantic comedy with copious good quips and quotable lines (I still can't stop saying ""She fascinates me"" and ""the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated"") this movie provides more style-drenched comedy than romance (perhaps think Grosse Point Blank with lawyers instead of hit men).
Overall, a great selection that I would recommend to fans of the genre.

1545528,4,B00005JMET,"Lighter and more conventional than the films establishing their reputation (BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, FARGO, etc.), INTOLERABLE CRUELTY nevertheless signals the Coen brothers' return to form after recent disappointments.  Though the antagonists (played by George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are outlandishly cynical, the movie itself is not.  No one is truly nasty in this story, only flawed (but deeply), and in true screwball tradition their innate human warmth endears them to us despite their mercenary attitudes toward love.  Zeta-Jones and Clooney's battle is like the battles between Russell & Grant in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, or Hepburn & Tracy in PAT & MIKE.  They never descend to the depraved meanspiritedness portrayed in deVito's WAR OF THE ROSES.
Zeta-Jones is delicious, giving us more in the flickering light in her eyes than most actors give at their most histrionic.  (She's very nearly in William Hurt's class.)  And in Clooney's performance I finally see the incipient charm for which some have compared him (a bit optimistically) to Archibald Leach himself.  The supporting cast is top notch, too:  Herrmann, Rush, Cedric, Duffy, Royce Applegate, and Jonathan Hadary are all splendid in their little roles.  And Billy Bob Thornton finally gets to display his craft as a character actor again, coming through with a performance as fine as his faro-dealer in TOMBSTONE.
The script is deft - - witty without calling attention to itself, which is no mean feat given characters equally conversant with Shakespeare and first-growth Bordeaux wines.  I especially admired Clooney's character's speech on love and marriage at the divorce lawyers' convention: emotional without sinking into sentimentality, morally focused but not preachy, a believable epiphany amidst farce.  It is good to see the Coen brothers doing again what no other filmmaker has done so consistently.  Perhaps they are the Aristophanes of our age.
As for the star rating, I would give 3  stars if Amazon permitted, meaning that I liked more than a little even though it falls short of the Coens' best.  Their best is very good, however, nearing and sometimes reaching greatness.  And compared to the goblets of dreck usually served by Hollywood, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is quite tolerable, surprisingly pleasing to the palate.  Not Chateau Margaux, to be sure, but not a jug of Red Mountain, either.  Perhaps this movie needs to breathe a bit after uncorking.  Somehow I suspect it will improve with age, thus give it the benefit of the doubt and award 4 stars instead of 3.",1076457600,3,2561,5.2200488997555015
1545529,3,B00005JMET,"After their more offbeat experiments like ""Fargo"" or ""Raising Arizona"", the Coen Bros return with this somewhat conventional yet still consistent cinematic experience. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is a dark romantic comedy, a satire on the rich and shallow californian people and their convenient marriages and divorces.
George Clooney plays a cynical, clever attourney and Catherine Zeta Jones enters as one of his new clients. As their relationship develops, a lot of sarcastic comedic situations unfold, providing an entertaining and witty picture. As far as romantic comedies go, this one earns some points for presenting originality and freshness, avoiding the sappy and overly sentimental fluff that mines so many others. The dialogue is well-written and there are even the typical weird characters that the Cohen Bros present in their movies, like the one played by Billy Bob Thornton.

Catherine Zeta Jones needs to get a refund from her acting school, and  George Clooney was better in his ER days.

1545532,5,B00005JMET,"I like the Coan Brothers. I havn't seen many movies that they made, but the few that I saw I thought were great. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is particular. I am also looking forwrd to their next movie ""The Ladykillers."" The reason that I liked this movie was because it was a different kind of movie that they would make. That is why alot of people thought it was bad. Can't a popular director try something different? You have to watch movies without comparing it to the director or actors past works. Watch a movie as if it's the first movie the director or actor ever made. That's the key to liking more movies. Don't compare! George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones are the stars of ""Intolerable Cruelty."" This was the movie where I relized that Catherine Zeta-Jones is a very beautiful women. I've always known that, but this movie kind of made that more known. It could also be done on purpose to show how everybody is instantly attracted to her in the movie, or it could just be the truth.
The movie starts with Donovan Donely who is a television producer for soap-operas. He walks into his home, and finds the pool guy in the house, which is strange because they don't have a pool. His wife is cheatings on him, and after his wife stabs him with something, he takes pictures of the wound, and then shoots after his wife as she drives away with the pool guy. His wife hires Miles Massey as her divorce lawyer, and although he has alot of evidence that she hurt him, he still gets her the most in the settlement and ruins Dovovans life. Heis unbeatable. When he meets Rex Rexroth however, he changes his whole aspect. Rex was cheating on his wife, and was caught by his wife Marylin's private eye Gus Petch. With her lawyer Freddy Bender she plans to get half of thr settlement. But Rex hired Miles to be his lawyer, and Miles gets a surprise witness Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy. After he ruins her live, Miles becomes scared that he is going to become a workaholiv like his old boss. He decides to persue the now single Marylin. But Marylin already has a new boyfriend by Southern oilman Howard Doyle. As Miles falls deeper and deeper into love with Marylin, it becomes to the point where a hitman may have to come into play in this screwball dark comedy.
The only problem with this movie was that is was to legal. I still gave it five stars, but eventually I began to get a little confused with all of these legal terms and pre-nup talk. I, frankly, began to get a little sick of it. I still really did like it, and will also probally get the DVD of this movie.
Richard Jenkins was in this movie as Marylin's lawyer. I really don't like him. I think he is a terrible actor and is just a waste of talent. But Geoffrey Rush is in the movie and I feel that he is one of the best actors of of time. He could be so funny and also dramatic at the same time. He makes up for what Richard Jenkins takes away from the screen.

1545533,4,B00005JMET,"Any film by brother team Joel and Ethan Coen is going to be eagerly awaited, and possibly hurt by the rabid expectations of their legions of fans, of which I am a member. Their highest profile, most mainstream movie to date,  Intolerable Cruelty was bound to test the loyalty of these fans as they take yet another step away from their avant garde (in case you've forgotten, these are the guys who did the classic Big Lebowski) comedy roots and into the mainstream. if the pre-film buzz wasn't evidence enough of this, Intolerable cruelty's writing and producing credits have the contributions of 2 other individuals. One of them is Matt Stone, one of the South Park guys. I admire the South Park Phenomenon but did not enjoy the film or the guys' other movie Orgazmo (before they made it big, Parker and Stone made Cannibal The Musical! a very funny movie, and better than their later projects.)
 Intolerable Cruelty is still a Coen movie, first and foremost, and a long way from any of the other film's I've just mentioned, including the Coens' own films. George Clooney, one of the most watchable actors in Hollywood, does legal and amorous battles with the lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones in this Coen-style romantic comedy. I won't bother much with the plot, since where the film really shines is in its usual array of offbeat characters and general zaniness.  Clooney essentially reprises his fast-talking swindler role O brother Where Art Though, but this time as a divorce attorney. His antics are supported well by the comedy performances of characters such as Wheezy Joe the assassin and Bernie Mac as the less-than-subtle private eye.
 Like most Coen movies, this one takes some getting used to. I recall my rather underwhelmed and unimpressed reaction to my first viewing of the Big Lebowski which has since become the sure-fire anecdote to a  day of grouchiness. There are a few big gag laughs, but the Coens primary strategy seems to be to just keep the chuckles coming. As true romance, the film doesn't really work, and its hard to care for any of these characters when there are so slimy, but if anyone can pull off a film with unlikable protagonists, its the Coens. Coen fans should give this one more a chance before deploring it as the inevitable Hollywood-ization of their revered filmmaking team, and it should be a wonderful introduction into the zany Coen world for mainstream audiences.",1072569600,6,2407,4.846715328467154
1545534,1,B00005JMET,"One can only assume that Joel and Ethan Coen were shooting for a bigger payday, and you can't blame them for that. With a history of smaller, tightly controlled films that for the most part were examples of the pinnacle of movie-making, they would have to feel the tug of envy as they watched various examples of mediocrity like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless In Seattle"" make boatloads of money.
So, they bring in a production company (Imagine) and the required co-producer (Brian Grazer)to make the big splash required to open a film.  I'm assuming, it's this arrangement that also resulted in - and I can't believe I'm writing this - a second screen-writing team to work with the Coens or more likely, to re-write their scenes to have a more, let's say, commercial appeal.  Control is leaving the building.
As you might imagine, what ends up on the screen is a disaster.  We get countless close-ups of the stars' faces, I guess because we're suppose to think they're so good looking; a non-sensical plot that even by farce standards doesn't hold up; acting by the female lead that I don't believe ever really results in her changing expressions; and a character - Clooney's law partner -that is right out of a TV sitcom.
But the biggest disapointment is the dialogue.  Admittedly, the bar is set at the highest level for the Coens, but this has none of the originality, the wit, hell, the laughs, that have been the joy of the viewer for the last two decades.  It committed the ultimate sin - it was boring.
Those of us sitting in the theaters are selfish for the most part.  We want to be entertained and we don't care what it takes.  Lord knows, Joel and Ethan Coen deserve to have made fortunes for themselves.  But we don't want it done at our expense.",1072137600,15,1766,4.584126984126984

1545638,4,B00005JMET,"A film by the Coen Brothers
Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a divorce lawyer.  He specializes in getting his client everything that he (or she) wants no matter how much in the wrong the client actually is.  He is brilliant and is also the author of the Massey Prenup, which is an iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement that has never been penetrated.  From the beginning of the movie, we get to see Miles Massey work, getting off both men and women who have cheated on their spouses.  Massey can work the court room and find loopholes and is incredibly successful.  He is so successful that he is able to get off a man, Rex Rexroth, after he is caught on videotape cheating on his wife Marilyn (Catherine Zeta-Jones).
This completely destroys Marilyn's way of life as she was in the marriage for the money and was trying to divorce him for the money that she would get.  During the divorce proceedings, Miles finds himself infatuated with Marilyn.  So much so that he takes risks to meet her and talk to her and hopefully to woo her.  Things don't go very smoothly (as far as Miles' dream relationship goes) and the more Miles tries to win Marilyn, the less likely it seems possible as she quickly finds a rich Texan named Howard Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton) to marry.
This is not your typical Coen Brothers movie.  This is the most commercial film that they've done, but there is still plenty of the Coen's offbeat humor and darkness throughout the film.  On one hand Intolerable Cruelty is a typical romantic comedy, but it is also anything but typical.  It was a very good movie, a real treat to watch, and I was surprised by just how much I liked it.  I would definitely recommend this movie.",1067904000,3,1688,4.552980132450331
1545639,3,B00005JMET,"This is a very stylish movie, and incorporates many of the techniques that the Coen Brothers have used to advantage in their other films.  However, while the utilization of such techniques as overstatement carried to the point of absurdity and characters who incorporate terminal weirdness were essential to the success of those films, they are taken to an extreme here which provides many truly comedic moments but actually detracts from the overall impact of the film. This story doesn't have to be extremely outrageous to be funny; after all, the media constantly bombards us with the crazy situations that evolve where infidelity and divorce are concerned and the extremes to which divorce lawyers will go supposedly in the interests of their clients.
George Clooney is Miles Massey, the media anointed star divorce lawyer continually burnishing his image in every way imaginable. Catherine Zeta Jones is Marylin Rexroth, whose sleuth catches her rich husband Rex Rexroth (Edward Hermann) in an act of marital infidelity and determines that her divorce settlement will be the path to riches and independence. When Miles succeeds in depriving her of the expected windfall in a hilarious courtroom scene, it is clear that will not be the end of their story. After all, he is getting bored with the repetitiveness of success and is looking for new challenges, while she is still searching for the path to a life of luxury. As the story proceeds, it is unclear until the end who is really being entrapped, whether it is primarily a game of one upmanship between the two of them, and how much of the stakes are financial and how much emotional. There is a wonderful supporting cast of great character actors including among others Geoffrey Rush, Cedric the Entertainer and Billy Bob Thornton in a fantastic role as Marylin's new love interest (Or is he?).
George Clooney's work is always enjoyable and Catherine Zeta Jones is easy to watch; in addition the performances of the remainder of the cast complemented the stars and provided some truly funny moments. However, as a totality the film was somewhat disappointing. As I indicated earlier, the basic story had enough clever elements and comedic potential so that it could have been told without the Coen Brothers penchant for the bizarre and the extreme (which was clearly essential to the success of RAISING ARIZONA, FARGO, and O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU). So this rating is a compromise, four plus for the actors and storyline, two plus for the onscreen implementation of the basic idea.

1545640,3,B00005JMET,"Intolerable Cruelty, while cleverly critical of material culture and romance-killing cynicism, never really knocks your socks off.
There are several legal leaps of imagination (signing a pre-nup at the altar) and quite a few corners in terms of unnecessary scenes that could have been cut as they don't add either to the plot or to the visual quotient of the movie.
But fortunately some rapid-fire dialogue and slapstick situations (Keyes' asthmatic hit-man is one for the film vault) help elevate the occasionally strained chemistry between the two charismatic leads that nonetheless prove to be utterly charming.
The movie offers a garden-variety twist, and it's pleasant enough, but it's the kind of surprise where nothing truly unexpected or outlandish happens to turn the tables on the audience.
What completely spooks me is that this is billed as a comedy. Yes, it is pleasantly charming (driven more by the dialog than situational tiggers) but it is not your Raizing Arizona or Hudsucker Proxy type of ruthless fun.
A watchable film, sure, carried predominantly by Zeta Jones and Clooney. But don't quite go expecting the class we've come to expect from the Coens.",1067731200,,1171,5.168421052631579
1545641,3,B00005JMET,"In their most recent film, the Coen brothers created a hilariously funny movie yet failed to spark sympathy for its protagonists. George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones, beautiful and aloof, recite their lines most expertly but lack conviction. Their performance seems well rehearsed rather than intriguing and spontaneous and gave me the impression that they finally got it on take 33.
Not to say that the movie lacks the Coen brother's trademark genius. A parade of caricaturistic characters march on screen, from a private detective with an anal fixation, to a hit man with asthma who's prone to anxiety attacks. The movie also features the funniest suicide scene that I've ever seen on screen. Ironically, both Clooney and Zeta Jones fade into this colorful background as yet another caricature and lack the depth that I expected from the main characters.
I enjoyed the movie and had a lot of laughs, but with Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona on their belts, I expected more from the Coen brothers.

1545642,3,B00005JMET,"I doubt that there are two more strikingly attractive actors in movies today than George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Zeta-Jones, in particular, has the kind of classic beauty that puts her right up there with the great screen legends of all time, women like Ingrid Bergman, Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn, who, with their ravishing good looks and photogenic quality, came to define the ideal of female pulchritude in their time.
Credit the Coen Brothers, who made ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" with having the good sense to know what they had in these two stars and for exploiting it to the full.  They have allowed the actors to play off their good looks, most especially Ms. Zeta-Jones, portraying an icy gold-digger who specializes in marrying rich men with the express purpose of taking them for everything they've got once the marriage is ended.  Clooney is the first-rate divorce lawyer who finally meets his match when he falls under the spell of this strangely bewitching woman.
The major joy in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" comes from watching these two tremendously attractive stars go at one another - be it in lust, passion or anger.  Miles and Marylin are both seasoned game-players and world-class manipulators who know how to get the better of the hapless victims who stumble headlong into their paths.  Unfortunately, the film itself never lives up to its promise of becoming a slashing satire on the mores of our divorce-happy society.  The main reason for this is that the script often shoots too low in its tone, opting for an overly broad, slapstick approach when a slyer, subtler style is what's really called for.  It's not that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't provide its fair share of laughs; it's just that we feel there should be a whole lot more of them given the pedigree of the film's makers and the high-powered acting of its amazingly gifted cast.
In addition to Clooney and Zeta-Jones - who hit all the right notes in their playing off one another - the lineup also includes Geoffrey Rush, Billy Bob Thornton, Edward Herrmann, Richard Jenkins and Cedric the Entertainer, who steals the few scenes he's in with his manic interpretation of a private investigator who specializes in capturing wayward spouses in compromising positions.
Perhaps, ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" for all its moments of mirth and fun, simply doesn't go far enough into the realm of outrageousness to make the concept really work.  The Coen Brothers, who have proven themselves masters of the absurd in the past, for some reason seem to be holding back in this film, going for the easy laugh and the easy sentiment when what we really want is for them to cut loose and go for the jugular (as Danny De Vito did with similar material in ""The War of the Roses"" so many years ago).  Maybe Miles and Marylin need to be a little more nasty, a trifle more cutthroat in their demeanor to bring it all to life.
""Intolerable Cruelty"" offers some hearty chuckles and some definite eye-candy in the person of Ms. Zeta-Jones, but, when all is said and done, the film is mainly just promises and not enough delivery.",1067040000,71,3093,4.865019011406844

IC skewers a most deserving set of subjects:  divorce attorneys and the legal profession, gold diggers, and foolish rich old men.  The Coen Brothers have produced a no holds barred comedy, and from start to finish their savage satirical wit finds it mark, producing one memorable scene and set of belly laughs after another.
George Clooney gives a fantastic performance as a top-notch Los Angeles divorce attorney, a role which allows him to show just how much acting goes into being a good attorney.  Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't have quite as meaty a part, but she gives an alluring performance.  In the supporting roles, Billy Bob Thornton gets to dust off his Texas accent, and creates a credible happy-go-lucky Texas oilman.  But the best supporting role is that of the senior partner of Clooney's law firm, an octogenarian representative of the legal profession who has long ago lost all traces of his humanity and soul.
The dialogue is finely honed, with barbs minor and major liberally sprinkled throughout.  The plot is intricate and requires some thought to follow, as well as the suspension of a minor amount of disbelief, but it all makes sense within the logic of the film.

Their last effort before the present feature, though, was not a comedy  The man who wasn't there -  but more like a dark-looking movie, visually beautiful and great acting by Billy Bob Thornton, but too slow and depressing to be considered a comedy, more like a satire.
In Intolerable cruelty they're back in their best genre, but there are some conception mistakes in it that makes it go to The Limbo of the forgettable movies.
The plot is somewhat funny in its own shallowness: Catherine Zeta Jones chases rich men, marry them and then tries to steal their money by means of law suits. George Clooney is the Pope of marital law, defending the fooled husbands.
The acting style resembles the one from O Brother..., but that movie was what in literature we would call a stereotypical farce. Besides, O Brother... is based on the Odissey, so we have nothing to comment on the plot. This two thing summed up and made it a very good comedy. In Intolerable cruelty, this acting style didn't fit. The background is much too usual, and the viewer cant help but thinking the characters are silly. And Im getting tired to watch Catherine ZJ  gorgeous as always - repeating the usual femme fatale role.
The good parts are that the dialogue is still diabolically fast and witty, and some very funny situations make the whole audience laugh hard. And, most of all, Billy Bob Thornton as a nearly-incomprehensible texan.
The Coens have done much better. Hope they improve next time.

1545759,4,B00005JMET,"This Coen brother's film is a delightful nod to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's complete with an Abbott and Costello-esque courtroom banter scene as the judge enters the courtroom and a romp with an asthmatic hired-killer that would have worked in any Mark Brothers film.  Like the really classic screwball comedies of Hollywood's golden age, we are presented with people we shouldn't like, in this case a divorce lawyer and a woman who marries for money and turns them into people we want to see wind up together.
There are twists and surprises typical in any Coen Brothers film which always take the stereotype of a character and then pushes it over the edge so that nothing is ever exactly the way it seems.
Comparisons to Fargo are futile.  This isn't Fargo, this is an entirely different type of movie, just as each of the Coen brothers films have been and absolutely unlike any other comedy to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years.  Clooney and Jones lit up the screen with chemisty and it is an utterly delightful return to the Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn type of comedy that worked so well in films like the Philadelphia Story and Bringing Up Baby.",1066348800,,1175,4.666666666666667
1545760,3,B00005JMET,"This film will be seen by movie buffs who recognize the producer/ director team known as the Cohen Brothers. These are the same folks who brought us Fargo and the smash O, Brother Where Art Thou?
In comparison, Intolerable Cruelty lacks the edge and sophistication of their previous work. There are some impossibly absurd characters that add color, but overall this is light-weight fare that doesn't quite satisfy.",1066262400,2,414,5.102941176470588
1545761,3,B00005JMET,"George Clooney is Miles Massey, a divorce law king who may have met his match.  Catherine Zeta Jones is Marylin - the queen of gold-digging divorcees (who marries so often, it's pointless to giver her last name).  Naturally, their respective professions guarantee that they'll cross paths and, given that this is a movie, they're bound to fall in love.  Except that this is also a Coen brothers movie (""Fargo"", ""Blood Simple"", ""Oh Bother"", ""Raising Arizona""), which means that we're not sure exactly what's on their minds.  Being great judges of character, each can spot the other from miles away - but something causes each to lower his/her guard for the other.  Is it love?  And since this is a Coen brothers movie, what schemes will they cook up against each other before they grow up and honestly fall for each other (or simply fall about each other).  Massey is an ace at the warfare of divorce law - which he proves phenomenonly well in the first half hour (despite solid proof of adultery, he manages to win all for the wife of a soap-opera producer played by Geoffrey Rush; he has crafted the perfect, impenenetrable pre-nuptial agreement) and though he wins an early battle against Marilyn, we begin to wonder if perhaphs he has bitten off way too much than he can chew.
""Intolerable"" is fun, but it's not the breathless fun of other Coen comedies like ""Brother"" or ""Hudsucker Proxy"" with its fast moving dialog and endless visual gags.  For a change, the Coens don't lard their story with hysterically off-balance supporting characters (like John Goodman or Charles Durning), and little of the plot goes to throwing us off balance with the intricate plotting of its stars. Unfortunately, the twists and turns seem less ironic than simply confusing (they love each other, they must conquer each other, they must destroy each other, but they can't live without each other).  The movie sets us up not to be surprised by the turns of its characters - Clooney starts off chipper but obviously dissatisfied with his life, and almost immediately smitten with Zeta-Jones; Marilyn only wants financial independence and freedom, but there are women who got that without having to choose it over love, and it's not long before she begins to wonder over whether there's more to happiness than a Porsche.  Worse, in spots, the film hints at the sort of mad-cap fun that the Coen brothers are known for.  There are some extra characters who do seem off-center, but they appear only briefly rather than ride the length of the flick, notably ""Cedric the Entertainer"" as a private investigator who works for anybody wanting to uncover any piece of evidence of infidelity (""nail his ass"" - that's his motto) but he disappears too soon, as if the flick couldn't come up with some way to tap into his energy.  There's also Billy Bob Thornton who appears to be a fast-talking scion of Texas oil money, the kind of character a Coen flick should be chok-filled with - but since ""Intolerable"" has few surprises, it can't keep your mind busy enough to forget that he might be one of Marilyn's weapons of destruction.  There's also Edward Herrman as Marilyn's first domestic victim (at least the first one in this movie).  His big problem isn't so much infidelity (though that is a problem) as much as a preoccupation with trains.  It's during his trial that the flick tosses some of the madcap jokes (a bout of fast wordplay between Clooney and a fellow lawyer with Herrman between them; a flamboyant concierge with some dirt on Zeta-Jones and Herrman) that may remind Coen fans of other movies.  It's only another sign that ""Intolerable"" is actually a conventional romantic comedy that tries to be a Coen brothers movie, but doesn't quite pull it off.  In short, if you're up for amovie, go for it.  Coen Bros. fans may not tolerate this one.",1066262400,,3828,4.783004552352049
1545762,3,B00005JMET,"""Intolerable Cruelty"" might be the first Coen Brothers film uncomfortable its own skin. Oh, it has the usual collection of inspired sequences mixed with an equal portion of needless ones - which could be said any Joel and Ethan C film not named ""Fargo."" What's surprising is how many styles the film tries - straight romance, black comedy, full-blown madcap - without finding one that suits it. George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones both look great, and they certainly look like they'd be great together in something. But not this movie.
Clooney is Miles Massey, an iceman divorce attorney that turns sure losers inside out by - well let's say his skill is more or less assumed and undefined. Zeta-Jones, with a movie star look that makes most Hollywood glamour girls look like coquettes, is gold digger Marilyn Rexroth, whose second husband (Edward Herrmann) is caught in a hotel room  (literally) doing the choo-choo dance with his mistress by video camera-toting PI (Cedric The Entertainer, drilling his one funny note into the Earth).
It's a worthy case for Miles, who's grown tired of making deals. Then he sees Marilyn slink into the negotiating room, and, in the one thing we can believe about ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" falls hard for her. Miles and Marilyn will duel once, then twice, then a third and a fourth time in a movie that quietly aspires to the cruel, violent theatrics of ""The War of the Roses"" without taking the same mean risks. Unlike that wicked Danny DeVito film, which freely peddled to its audience a lusty hatred for the characters, the Coens feel the need to straddle us. The remainder of the film is filled with their quirky bit characters (the hitman and the ""senior partner"" are pretty hilarious) and what passes for chemistry between the leads.
Zeta-Jones is luminous. But her bored, distracted performance is nearly an insult for a plot that requires a certain amount of pep - her level, composed gaze is fetching for about half the movie, but then we'd like her to have a pulse. Clooney plays the ham as if to do the work for both of them, gawking and mugging and flopping around like a fool. Coupled with performances in ""Solaris"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" Clooney almost seems to trying to work against his movie star looks and delivery.  The bright spot is Billy Bob Thornton in a cameo as one of Marilyn's husbands, a petroleum heir that used to play a little tight end at Texas A&M. His presence is short-lived.
The Coens usually deliver a dash of visual flair; that's missing in ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" unless Zeta-Jones counts as scenery. So is their nose for consistent, flashy verbal gymnastics, as at least three long bits - an opening sequence with Geoffrey Rush as a TV producer, a ridiculous ""Who's On First?"" riff in the courtroom, and a speech delivered by Miles at a Las Vegas seminar - whiff entirely. And Clooney nerdy sidekick, played by Paul Adelstein, could be the most poorly conceived character the brothers have ever created.
Much was made of the Coens' partnership with producer Brian Grazer on this film in an effort, like Woody Allen with Dreamworks, to make a ""commercial"" - read: moneymaking - picture. Outside of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" which had a cultlike following because of its bluegrass soundtrack, none of the Coen films - not even ""Fargo,"" now widely considered one of the best films ever made, - hit the bank in their first runs. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is no more mainstream, really - in some ways, it's the antithesis of what audiences crave - it just has a better marketing campaign. If the final gross helps finance another great Coen film, so be it; otherwise, it's a shiny suit the brothers didn't need.",1066089600,11,3696,4.809748427672956

One of the most humorous things I've enjoyed I discovered by mistake:  I played the first scene (with Ed Hermann) using Spanish audio inadvertently.

Since I have not watched this movie in several years, I could not remember if it was supposed to be like this, but I found it extremely hilarious, specially since the lips did not match the audio (akin to an old Godzilla movie).  I will play it like this for a long time to come.

Note:  If you want to skip the previews without seeing or hearing them and your system won't let you, connect your DVD player using only analog channels and simply let them play with the sound and TV off until it gets to 'root.'

Hot Toasty Rag, December 18, 2017

Im really not a Coen Brothers fan, even though Ive sat through several of their films with an open mind and a willingness to laugh. Intolerable Cruelty and Hail, Caesar! are the only films of theirs I not only like, but love!

George Clooney stars as a successful and famous divorce lawyer, but he confides to his faithful assistant, Paul Adelstein, that hes bored with his life. While protecting his client, Edward Hermann, from surrendering a huge divorce settlement, he finds himself falling for the gold-digging wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones! George and Catherine have fantastic chemistry together, and the sparks practically fly off the screen! Catherine is incredibly beautifulas alwaysand even when you're hating what shes doing, youll still love watching her do it. Georges subtle touches to his character make him so realistic in his role, and he plans out his comedic delivery with separate perfect beats for stutters, expressions, and words.

Everyone in the film is at their comedic prime, delivering the hilarious lines with impeccable timing and amazingly straight faces. Even though I own this movie and have enjoyed watching it at least twenty times by now, I still cant pick a favorite scene, joke, or character. Paul Adelsteins palpable disgust when he eats at a greasy spoon is so relatable, and when he finally bursts out, Why are we eating here? it has me in heaps of laughter every time. Geoffrey Rush opens the film in a hilarious vignette, and every second hes on the screen theres something to laugh at. Richard Jenkins, Edward Hermann, and Billy Bob Thorton also have small but memorable roles, and the movie wouldnt be nearly complete without them.

From Have you ever sat before her before? to What are you nuts, have you forgotten Kershner? to I told him it was no-go, Intolerable Cruelty is full of lines that will quickly become household phrases. Give it a watch, and if we have the same sense of humor, I know youll love it as much as I do!",1513555200,,2035,4.872832369942197
