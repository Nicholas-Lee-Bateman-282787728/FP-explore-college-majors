It is a two VHS tape set, they are shrink wrapped together.",1388880000,,281,4.203703703703703
7892123,5,6305572135,"Unofficial sensationalist ""insider"" VHS tapes were a mainstream thing in the late 90's and early 00's, and everything had them. Pokemon, Harry Potter, etc. I bought a copy of these tapes (and its sequel) about a decade after their release because I was looking for something hilarious to make fun of, and this was a literal goldmine. The content hasn't aged well at all, and it's readily apparent. The production values are terrible, the personalities of the people behind the camera are still, awkward, and laughable, and the background music, well, don't get me started on it. If you're paying more than a couple of bucks for this 2-tape set you're getting ripped off, otherwise pony up the cash and enjoy the show. With the right kind of party atmosphere you will laugh your ass off.",1326240000,,786,4.786764705882353
