The are some good DVDs out there on the National Parks, one is Treasures of America's National Parks, but none of them give justice to the Eastern parks. The Eastern National Parks & Historic Sites by Holiday does a great job of covering the Eastern United States that no other DVD series does I have found to date.

This DVD is 1 Hour and 25 minutes long, filmed as most travel type DVDs are, but does keep your interest with information and facts. The film and sound are high quality though not in wide-screen format. The DVD cover says it will play in all regions. The DVD cover also says it has 2 hrs, 15 min running time, but that must include the special features.

I have a guide book on the National Parks and it doesn't cover many of the locations this DVD has. It has the National Parks, Civil War battlefields and monuments, scenic drives, lakes & ocean views, and tid bits of information to entice you to visit to learn more.

Most DVDs on the National Parks focus on the West, which is where most parks are located, but this DVD will tell you what the Eastern United States has to offer and it's a lot more than I ever thought. I think you will be as surprised as I was.
