8166442,3,B000M5ALUC,"If you are really interested in WW II movies and WW II history, you will find this movie authentic and a good story about the last days of the 3rd Reich. It was amazing to see a ""Marder"" german tank hunter, perfect period weapons, uniforms and such supplied by ""reenactors"". Some of the critics point out minor stuff like,""uniforms veing too clean"". It is a good movie told from from the German perspective. These type of films are very rare. Try to name 5 off the top.. . . . . Das Boot? . . . .ah, ""letters from Iwo Jima."" Not many come to mind. Finally, if you really want to see a top WW II movie, definatly check out ""Iron Cross.""",1275696000,,635,4.170731707317073
