8382063,3,B002VJ05FS,"Pretty good documentary about 3 different women making effective changes in the lives of their community members. This documentary was realistic, and gave a good view of what goals the women are trying to achieve.

In the midst of poverty, the 3 women seem optimistic about bettering their communities. A HIV-positive woman in Vietnam seeks to educate others about HIV prevention and prevent the spread of HIV. An educated woman in the poverty-stricken country of Mali has established a foundation to educate migrant girls and help them obtain job skills. And a woman in Bosnia seeks to establish a women's agricultural coop to economically benefit her community as well as bring together different ethnicities.

The documentary was more informative than emotional or heartfelt. I didn't feel my heartstrings being tugged, but the documentary did leave me with a sense of feeling inspired, and optimistic towards mankind.",1333843200,,921,5.301369863013699
8382064,5,B002VJ05FS,"If you are ever losing your faith in humanity, you need to view this movie. This is a story of three women (of Vietnam, Mali, and Bosnia) who are working to change the communities in which they live. Without much money or outside assistance, they make a positive impact. The movie shook this American woman out of her complacency, and has moved me to be an advocate for women around the world.",1275264000,,393,4.472222222222222
8382065,5,B002VJ05FS,"This film is mind-blowing. It is extremely raw, yet hopeful. While it does cover some very sad topics, the whole film has an incredibly positive overtone. This film highlights the power of women as individuals who change their lives and the lives of others. Three extremely different women are chronicled as they overcome their own personal struggles. Each of these women is doing their own part in trying to make their community a better place. This film has a number of very influential women involved, including Madeline Albright and Natalie Portman. This was one of the most eye-opening films I've seen in a long time. Not only was it informational, but it was emotional. It came together to create a great film that did not have one boring moment. I was actually disappointed when the film ended. The extras on the DVD are incredible as well. Very uplifting!",1268956800,,863,4.837837837837838
8382066,5,B002VJ05FS,"This video demonstrates the power of the individual in spite of overwhelming circumstances.  The three women portrayed are fighting ignorance over AIDS, the conflicts in Bosnia and the lack of education for girls in Mali.  Their persistence, inner strength and energy should shame us all into action in our own communities.  There are so many problems just waiting for people to stand up and say enough, I will make changes and encourage others to do so!  I highly recommend watching this film and then taking action to challenge the status quo in our own country - pick an issue - health care, the deficit, poverty, hunger, violence - you name it!  Just work on something a little at a time and you can make change just as these three women have.",1268438400,,747,4.67175572519084
8382067,5,B002VJ05FS,"""A Powerful Noise"" is one of those movies where after you watch it, you just want to tell everyone you know about it. ..And that's exactly what I'm doing.

It's a film about empowering women & girls and inspiring them to get educated about the spread of HIV/AIDS.

The film follows three women from three different countries, Mali, Vietnam and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and shows as they help women in their countries make changes in their lives. They strive to make a difference in lives of these women by showing them how imperative it is to learn about the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.

It's a great documentary that simply inspires its audience to reach out to their communities, and remain hopeful for change.",1268265600,,717,4.860655737704918
8382068,5,B002VJ05FS,"I just watched this film and must say that I was extremely moved. The strength and courage that it took these three women to fight for the empowerment and education of women and girls everywhere is astonishing. This is a must-see for anyone who believes that even one person can make a difference and change the world.

The support of the organizations, celebrities and various groups for this film just proves how impactful ""A Powerful Noise"" is and that it is a documentary that will continue to inspire and motivate people for years to come.",1265328000,,544,4.726315789473684
8382069,5,B002VJ05FS,"Extremely moving film about the power of women to make a difference in their worlds, through individual action and by joining together. The film chronicles three very different women across the globe as they overcome different personal challenges to make their community a better place. Also amazing is the panel discussion that's available on the dvd with Madeline Albright, Natalie Portman, Nicholas Kristof and others talking about all the issues. Seeing this film in a sold out theater and watching the live discussion was an incredibly motivating experience. Make sure to share this with all the women in your life.",1262131200,3,620,5.21
