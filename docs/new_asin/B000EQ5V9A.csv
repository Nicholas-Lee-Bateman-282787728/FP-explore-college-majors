2527863,4,B000EQ5V9A,"I've purchased this DVD to find out what's behind pop art who are its main protagonists and indeed who gets to call it art? The feature is made up by a series of interviews with prominent artists from the 50s and 60s who weren't so well known back then. In fact is a film about Henry Geldzahler who went to the art school with Andy Warhol and became curator at Met during the 60s, Henry introduced artists like Larry Poons, Mark Di Suvero, Andy Warhol, etc to the general public thus enlarging and challenging the established view of what's art. The movie also answered my question - pop art social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities...banalities and vulgarities which is to say in effect indistinguishable from advertising art.",1176163200,9,752,4.661654135338346
2527864,5,B000EQ5V9A,"Henry Geldzahler came from a well-to-do family and always wanted to be a curator.  After interning at the Whitney at 15 he fell in love with modern art.  He got a degree from Yale and after a couple of years of doctoral studies at Harvard he accepted a position at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was hardly known for its support of the latest directions in art.

This movie is about Geldzahler and what he did to support the pop art movement that included artists such as Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, and many others.  The story is told with tapes and films of Geldzahler, as well as period and contemporary interviews with the artists concerned (whether supportive or contrary to the movement).

The culmination of the film is the famous and hugely controversial show Geldzahler put on in 1970 at the Metropolitan. ""New York Painting 1940-1970"".  It was a blockbuster and still resonates to this day.  I loved the comment about how he selected what to put in the show (because no matter how large an exhibition, so much had to be left out).  Geldzahler said that he picked those works that he had seen and than left him wanting to see it again.  Whatever you think about the ""seriousness"" or ""worth"" of the art, much of it is certainly beautiful and all of it is full of cheer, optimism, fun, and some downright silliness.  Isn't that refreshing from being dour all the time?

Henry Geldzahler died far too young at 59 in 1994.  We even get to see inside his home and the beautiful objects with which he had surrounded himself.  They are stunning.

This is a fine short film to get some background about this interesting and influential patron on modern art and the artists who did all that work.  It is quite charmingly done and never gets sidetracked in the side arguments.

2527865,5,B000EQ5V9A,I teach contemporary art.  This film utilizes clips and quotes from other films about highly significant artists working from the late 50s forward.  It is time for the general public to see Henry Geldzahler as the catalyst and creative coordinator for this diverse group. . .a must have for understanding the evolution of art since the 1960s.,1167004800,12,342,4.982456140350878
2527866,5,B000EQ5V9A,"A fascination with influence may draw you to this documentary of art appreciation. Henry Geldzahler was the first contemporary art curator for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and his ""New York Painting and Sculpture 1940-1970"" exhibit is said to be the largest exhibit of modern art by living artists at the Met.

Through this journey into the life of Henry Geldzahler we discover the depths of the friendship between Henry and Andy Warhol and how at the height of their friendship they talked on the phone daily. It seemed they supported each other's artistic visions.

Henry Geldzahler loved to be photographed, was a natural in front of a camera and also loved to sit for portraits. David Hockney's painting of Henry sitting on a couch is shown in reality and then as the painting. These types of contrasts show reality vs. the artist's vision and perhaps explain ""in a subtle way"" how Henry's presence changed the world of art.

Since I had just arrived in the world in the 60s, this is all pretty much new to me and it helps to explain the rise of contemporary art in a positive way. It is likely that you will recognize very few artists featured if you are under 40 and not an art student, but this doesn't detract from the human-interest story.

Artists interviewed include: Andy Warhol, Frank Stella, David Hockney, John Chamberlain, Francesco Clemente, Mark di Suvero, Ellsworth Kelly, Larry Poons and James Rosenquist. This gives a fascinating inside view of what was happening in the art world during the 60s.

After viewing this DVD, you can't help but recognize the influence of the artists featured while visiting today's art museums.

8112844,1,B000EQ5V9A,"Although I hoped for some insights into the 1960's art world of New York, I lasted less than ten minutes before succumbing to nausea and vertigo from this frenetic, fragmented, and overstimulated film. For example, some expert was given perhaps one minute to make a point--while background music with words conflicted with his own words, as did the pointless special effects background.

There was no room to think or behold anything. What a waste of that ten minutes.

I had to watch a Duke Ellington video just to recover.",1297555200,3,524,4.876404494382022

8112846,5,B000EQ5V9A,I love this video. It is both documentary and philosophy in about the visual arts. Specifically; the abstract and contemporary arts and art critics engagement in these domains.,1257984000,,176,5.321428571428571
8112847,4,B000EQ5V9A,"Have you ever wondered how the Andy Warhols, the Jasper Johns and the David Hockneys got their work in museums while they were alive?

Well, I have! ""Who Gets to Call it Art?"" is an immensely entertaining collection of how contemporary artists and their work got ""the nod"" from one man. During this eighty minute documentary, you will hear from the artists themselves and every one points their success to one man... Henry Geldzahler. as curator for the stuffy and dated Metropolitan Museum of Art, Henry was sent out from behind his desk to search out the New York underground, modern artists.

This is one of my favorite historic DVDs because I can listen to and watch some of my most admired risk-takers in the 60s. This was the beginning of how American artists challenged everything and changed art as we know it today. Henry (a real character of a guy) shows us how he did his work and helped make them all famous. Get this DVD!",1232841600,5,934,4.586826347305389
8112848,4,B000EQ5V9A,"Recommended doc for anyone that enjoys documentaries in general and anyone that is interested in art history and particularly American art and art in the 20th Century. Particularly the pop art scene/movement of the 60s. One guy that got to call it art apparently was a guy named Henry Geldzahler. Maybe rich people call ultimately and then it gets to stay in museums and then it is art. Pop-art isn't as important as older stuff from say the 1800s like Monet and Turner. Andy Whorehole was not a great artist. Also, Francis Bacon is excellent.",1221436800,,543,4.726315789473684
8112849,4,B000EQ5V9A,"I very much enjoyed the video, especially the interviews with artists that were highlighted in the movie.  A glimse of living artists that will live forever in this video.  It is too bad we weren't able to capture more of the artists in their studio's creating their work.  A wonderful comment on what makes art and how modern contemporary art was brought in to the acceptance of the established art world. I would recommend this dvd to anyone interested in contemporary art.",1215043200,,475,4.7682926829268295
