ECKHART TOLLE has emerged as one of the world's finest spiritual teachers of our time. His books, The Power of Now, Practicing the Power of Now, Stillness Speaks, and A New Earth, are international bestsellers, and his talks draw large crowds around the world.

This series represents an opportunity to participate in a one week retreat with Eckhart and so to go deeper into stillness - becoming one with who you are in the depth of your Being.  A certain degree of spiritual maturity, however, is required of anyone wishing to participate fully in this retreat series.  What is spiritual maturity?  You know the meaning of presence, not as a concept, but as a living reality.  The retreat will help you to enter that dimension more deeply, to always know yourself as consciousness (rather than ""this"" or ""that""), and to manifest this realization - your true purpose - in your daily life.",1239667200,12,967,4.795180722891566
