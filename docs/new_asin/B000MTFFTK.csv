2747675,5,B000MTFFTK,Bill's comedy routine is top-notch as usual.  It seems as though I am watching my life revealed.  Hilarious!!,1179273600,2,109,5.0
2747676,5,B000MTFFTK,"Being somewhat of a fan of Blue Collar Comedy Tour, I decided to focus on Bill Engvall.  I rented this DVD, not sure if I would like it.  Well, here's my opinion: It started off pretty slow, but right around the middle of it, Engvall really became a riot.  I loved everything about this DVD-the special features were great; I loved the behind the scenes feature on Bill's ""Thunderbirds"" segment.  The Delta Farce trailer was hilaious-I'll be seeing that!  But what topped it off for the special features was the bonus ""Here's Your Sign"" track.

Basically, if you like Engvall or just Blue Collar in general, this is a must see.",1176422400,4,627,4.603603603603603
2747677,5,B000MTFFTK,"I enjoy Bill Engvall's humor and bought this DVD because of it. The first half or so of the routine was the Engvall I hoped for...funny and presenting his somewhat eccentric take on life to which many (most?) of us can relate. Then came the bits that gave the concert its name;;;""15 Off Cool."" As he went on about never quite being cool and his efforts to attain coolness, I started laughing harder and harder. It got to the point where my jaw was hurting from the laughter. That material is easily the funniest Engvall I've seen or heard, which is saying a lot!",1175558400,12,562,4.413461538461538
2747678,4,B000MTFFTK,"Bill Engvall is charming as always as he talks about his marital life, growing older, and what it was like to grow up a dork -- always ""15 degrees off cool.""  Laughs from beginning to end, no matter how cool you are, THINK you are, or never were! Something for just about everyone!",1175558400,5,281,4.30188679245283

2747690,5,B000MTFFTK,I've seen Bill live a couple of times and he is dynamic! This DVD is absolutely hilarious!!! It has added material that the CD doesn't have and let's be honest seeing his facial expressions are such a laugh out loud experience. I highly recommend this.,1486771200,,252,4.622222222222222
2747691,2,B000MTFFTK,"I normally like Bill Engvall but I never finished watching this rental.  Too many fart jokes; not my idea of funny.  I'd rather he stuck with ""here's your sign!""",1486166400,,161,4.517241379310345

2747755,5,B000MTFFTK,"Engvall is our generations version of Will Rogers and Jonathon Winter.  He is a storyteller, and his comedy stays within the bounds of taste without being prudish.

It was so good that I had to buy it, only the second comedy DVD I've ever spent money on (""Sinbad, Where U Been"" being the first).  And every time I watch it, I nearly fall off the sofa laughing.  I, too, was always one of those people who really wanted to be cool, but could never quite pull it off.  Just about 15 degrees off.

This is truly a classic and a keeper.",1411257600,,448,4.162790697674419

2747791,5,B000MTFFTK,I have always enjoyed Bill Engvall.  There are just too many comedians who believe funny should be vulgar and when someone comes around like this it is refreshing.

So I have been trying to get their comedy acts on dvd.  I really enjoyed this dvd. This I believe was supposed to be about Bill's midlife crisis.  He wanted a motorcycle and his wife got him a scooter.  He talks about how when he was a kid and teenager, how all the other kids had cool posters in their rooms and neat cars.  But he always had the dorky posters and had a Gremlin.  This is a really good dvd to add to your comedy collection.",1363219200,,567,4.155963302752293
