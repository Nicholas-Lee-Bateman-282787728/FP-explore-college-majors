Ok, now that I got that out of the way, first let me say that I have a bias for:

1) Geeky Stuff
2) Gaming and Richard's Ultima Series
3) Astronomy, Space

This documentary is SO engaging, I was NEVER bored, not for one second of it. As others have mentioned, the main movie is basically organized as Intro, Training, Space Station and Return/Conclusion. In the Intro we get more or less a mini-bio of Richard Garriott. If you don't know who Richard is, he is a video game developer, creator of the Ultima RPG series, and an entrepreneur. I think this overview was well and candidly done with interviews from his father, brother, etc. they go into his first gaming venture, all in all it lets you know from the get-go the type of person Richard is. But the meat of the documentary and what I liked the most were the ""behind-the-scenes"" of the training in Russia. It all feels so different and surreal... Everything is paced excellently that by the time the launch comes, you FEEL as if you are taking the trip with them... in fact YOU ARE taking the trip!

The images from life inside the Space Station were also good and you could see the rapport between those guys up there.

Anyway, not going to ""spoil"" any other scenes or information but if you: like space, like Richard, or just plain want to know what it took to buy your ticket to space, this is a great movie to watch!

Totally Recommended!

(Now I can't wait for space travel to be available to everyone without having to sell an island or something for it! ;-))",1355961600,2,1586,4.43298969072165
5060618,5,B0077D2AJW,"I have seen this film several times now.  Garriott's story -- from geek programmer kid, to Hall-of-Fame videogame designer, to starting a company to help privatize space travel so that he, too could travel on a rocket -- is one of adventure and inspiration suitable for viewing by all.  The cinematography is awesome with up-close access to Russia's secretive Star City, the launch pad, inside the space capsule (including the fiery re-entry), and all over the International Space Station.  And the accompanying original music is equally well done.  Plus, the information provided about the contributions of the Russian people to the creation and advancement of human space flight is stunning -- things we simply never hear about or are taught in the USA because of our transfixation on our one biggest achievement: the moon landing (important as that was).  This film is worth seeing for all ages and is particularly good for kids with interests in computer games, science, space, etc.  Be sure to catch some of the outtakes at the end, too, where Garriott shares some very funny stories to live audiences while on a speaking tour following his trip to the ISS.",1339113600,2,1162,4.963917525773196

He is an explorer and a creative genius and this story of his journey into space is only a small piece of the adventures that he has had in his lifetime.  If you are an old school computer game geek, or at all interested in space exploration, you will absolutely enjoy this movie.",1483833600,,333,4.442622950819672

It is also a way to see that they are not tourist but crew member with a strong training. An incredible adventure, unique and magic!",1464998400,,249,4.681818181818182
8511701,4,B0077D2AJW,"Story of Richard whose dad was an astronaut but Richard has bad eyesight so he does not qualify.  He creates a video game and goes to Canada for LASIK surgery.  He asks NASA and then Russia if there is any price that could be paid to go to space. NASA says no and Russia says maybe.

He ends up using all his $ to pay 30 million to go to Russia to learn the language, train, and then he gets to go to the International Space Station for a few days. Interesting.",1408752000,,461,3.989130434782609

8511703,5,B0077D2AJW,"Very glad I got this.  It begins with some scenes of the rocket prep and then fills in the back-story of how Garriott got his money he used to pay for the flight.  Then its back to the real focus of the movie which is the astronauts' prep for flight, the launch, the time on-station, and the return to earth in the Soyuz.  Amazingly well produced movie.  Highly recommend!",1388793600,,372,4.3478260869565215
8511704,4,B0077D2AJW,Required for space buffs or anyone interested in the current state of the space exploration. As I am a tour guide at the Intrepid Museum and we have Greg Olsen's Soyuz capsule on display it is great to put a full story behind the machine,1382054400,,237,4.288888888888889

8511708,5,B0077D2AJW,"I truly enjoyed ""Man on a Mission.""  It's a great documentary featuring such an inspiring man.  Richard Garrott's journey to the International Space Station was mesmerizing and I loved that there was so much detail about each step required.  It was uplifting, heartfelt and a thrill to see.  I look forward to watching it many more times as I start to plot out my own journey into space.",1360195200,,387,4.647058823529412
