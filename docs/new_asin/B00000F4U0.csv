7907759,5,B00000F4U0,This is a great animated film from my childhood. Brings back memories. This film is also hard to find I'm glad someone held onto it.,1392163200,,132,4.32
7907760,5,B00000F4U0,"I couldn't stand the Graphic nudity and rape scene in the original version of this movie, so the FHE version is great for all ages. Life lessons from the movie include not operating a vehicle while intoxicated and how bad it can be if the world is vaporized by evil Bionoids.
buy it for your kids and show them the best version of Macross to come to the US.",1388275200,,357,4.188405797101449
7907761,5,B00000F4U0,Was a great Anime back in the day and is classic now. I have watched this over and over and still cant get enough of this series.,1300233600,,129,3.814814814814815
7907762,2,B00000F4U0,"I give this movie 1 star for the horrible dub and excessive editing (about 40 min worth) from the original film Macross: Do You Remember Love (Ai Oboete Imasuka) from 1984.

I also give this version 1 additional star for the dub being so horribly bad that the dialogue is now timeless and classic in a campy sense.",1299974400,,314,4.413793103448276
7907763,3,B00000F4U0,"This is a good purchase, perfect for completing your collection. Although the quality of the japanese audio its better in other versions and the extras are the weakest point.",1203292800,,174,5.0344827586206895
7907764,5,B00000F4U0,"I see lots of reviews and many of them lump these products into one.  This is understandable as they are in reality 2 cuts of the same movie.  The original japanese is Super Dimensional Fortrss Macross Do you remember love (which is now avaialble subtitled on DVD and is worthy to find).  In 1984 this movie was so sucessful  in japan that TOHO (yes the godzilla people) and BIG west dubbed it for release in the Englsh speaking pacific rim (Hong kong australia etc).  So was born Super Space fortess Macross<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macross/dp/6303501141/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macross</a>.  While not an exact dub it has the basics of the original japanese translation.  Please note this version of the film is 115 minutes and should not be seen by younger kids (nudity and blood).  If you think this is a poor translation but don't have the desire to read the subtitled version remember the english This cut was used as an english language learning tool back in Japan.  In the early 90's after the sucess of robotech in the US toho was using the one license harmony gold didn't buy DYRL and peddled it to Just for kids.  this is Clash of the bionoids&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macross-Clash-of-the-Bionoids/dp/B00000F4U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macross: Clash of the Bionoids</a>&nbsp;which cut out 40 minutes of footage including heavy gore, the shower scene nudity, and a slow part of Misa and Ikaru stranded.  It is otherwise identical to the english Dub I talked about earlier.  This is the one kids can watch but odds are they will get bored at times.  both tapes are Full frame.  at this time the english dub is not on DVD and the only widescreen release was on LAserdisc in 88.  I first saw this movie as bionids as a late teen in 92 and have since aquired the laserdisc.
it is a great film but it is a lot deeper than the mindless anime of today and the actors are a little ""wooden"" a times.  well worth the prices of used VHS for any Robotech or macross fan and the real plus is Mari Ijiima is th evoice for Minmay in english",1178841600,,2137,5.0113314447592066
7907765,1,B00000F4U0,"Sorry, but as much as I want to rate this highly, I just can't, even with Mari Ijima providing the english as well as Japanese voiceovers for Minmay, the character that put Ijima-san's name on the map.  Harmony Gold totally killed Macross when the redubbed the voices and rewrote the storyline to change it into robodrek, and I also feel that ADV did much the same when they redubbed SDF Macross that time around as well.  It's sickening how here in America we always want to dub and dumb down excellent examples of foreign culture.  So in short, this product stinks......end of discussion",1164412800,,589,4.699029126213592
7907766,3,B00000F4U0,"Clash of the Bionoids is the English dubbed and slightly altered version of the original Japanese film ""Macross: Ai Oboete Imasu ka"" or 'Love: Do you Remember?'.

The movie exists as a movie in the universe of the original TV series...and of course as a movie by itself in our world :) (a bit confusing but true).  So basically, the people in the Robotech/Macross universe make this movie, which is about the first space war between the Zentradi and the humans. And this is basically the whole Macross story told in a feature length film.

It slightly changes the story and compacts it into approximately 90 minutes of storytelling.  The animation is simply fantastic considering it was released in theatres the summer of 1984 (In Japan that is). The character and background art are simply amazing, even by today's standards.

I'd recommend tracking down the original Japanese version if you can find it, but this version isn't all that bad either. Clash of the Bionoids follows the Japanese Macross, so Robotech fans who haven't seen the original Macross might be a bit confused as far as characters and names are concerned when they see it (as Robotech didn't air on American TV until '85). But it's still a fair English version of a fantastic Japanese anime film.",1105488000,4,1267,4.820276497695852
