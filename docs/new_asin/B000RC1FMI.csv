8199932,5,B000RC1FMI,"The string skipping technique that Danny Gill teaches are challenging enough to complement or supplement any existing skills.  As advertised, there is an appropriate exercise for all levels.  Also, Danny Gill goes over the rhythmic background, the chord progression and fingering -some of them not basic either!

But, what I like is that the melodic exercises taught in this DVD are not just for building string skipping technique.  These exercises are also functional so any performer may build their own nifty creation around them.",1360022400,,533,5.309523809523809
