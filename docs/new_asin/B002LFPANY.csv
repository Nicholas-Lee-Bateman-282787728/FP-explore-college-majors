8372906,4,B002LFPANY,"Obviously, immature teenage-minded Americans cannot appreciate this kind of deep suspense drama since their minds are so underdeveloped.
Their Hollywood-trained dumb and dumber minds cannot fathom the artistry and deep sense of humanity that saturates this movie.
When Americans do not understand such deep emotions, they have only one resort but to blame it on Asian ethnicity of this movie, since their moronic and racist minds can only handle so much truths.",1525737600,,461,5.416666666666667
8372907,4,B002LFPANY,"This is a LOOOOONG movie, and at over 2 hours it feels long when you watch it. The story does not require more than an hour and a half to convey so you may find yourself struggling to stay interested. That aside, it's not that bad of a film...but it's not a horror flick (showed up under 'horror' for me). It's more of a drama and there are no supernatural elements even if at first it may seem that way. That's fine. I find most supernatural movies to be quite ridiculous.

The basic premise of the movie is a guy starts seeing apparitions of two children he saw on a train while one evening, who were dead. He did not know they were dead when he saw them - he heard about them on the news the day after. This event triggers him into some reviving suppressed memories that he had, and that's where he gets help from a narcoleptic woman that he meets along the way. Anyway, watch the movie if you want details. It's not bad, just clear your calendar first...",1525219200,,958,4.2349726775956285

8372909,3,B002LFPANY,"I don't think so based on what some of these reviews state. This one isn't easily explained but it definitely takes too long to do so with all those long shots. Some of the comments made about this one are about scenes not even in the movie and though theres lots of room to quibble about whats happening, whats real or what just happened its an intriguing physiological drama and not a horror nor much of a thriller. Could easily have been better they didn't try to make so artistic and added a little more explanation to the non-linear story which you may have to see again to fill in the gaps. I think a key scene is the Doctor having his office remolded to ensure patients don't see each other and Im still trying to figure out what really happened to have him do so.",1521849600,,771,4.287671232876712
8372910,5,B002LFPANY,"I watched this on Prime. Incredible. I never jump, gasp, tense up or really react to horror/thriller movies. In this film, I did. I actually made comments out loud, something I've never done before. There are a few scenes that sent shivers dancing up and down my back. That's never happened to me before either. Great story, great characters, great acting. This film is superbly made. Forget the horror/thriller crap that Hollywood puts out. That junk doesn't compare to this.",1520467200,,476,4.9625

8372912,2,B002LFPANY,"Jeong-won (Shin-yang Park) is an interior designer. He sees the ghosts of two young girls. He bumps into a girl (Gianna Jun) who has fainting spells, but also has this vision thing. His interest in her vision causes a rift with his girlfriend (Seon Yu).

This is a Korean film available with English and Spanish subtitles. It goes from the vision into his childhood and a trail. The film s 1% horror and 99% faux drama. The Asians have yet to figure out ""90 minutes in the can"" type of films and attempts to make each one a long drawn out masterpiece. I was mostly bored.

Guide: No f-bombs, or sex. Very brief nudity.",1417737600,5,618,4.412280701754386
8372913,4,B002LFPANY,"The first time I watched ""The Uninvited"" (2003, Korea) I thought it was boring. The second time I watched it I thought it was good but needed approximately 20 minutes edited out. Last night I watched it for the third time and was captivated from start to finish. It's truly one of the most effectively depressing films of the past decade, and is essential viewing for lovers of slow-burning, psychological, dramatic horror films with heaping quantities of character development.

The key to enjoying this film is to pay attention to the subtle details. Even the most ordinary dialogue is used meaningfully here. These characters have experienced horrific acts of death and violence in their pasts and have also experienced dysfunctional relationships with others. These dysfunctional relationships are communicated in a fragmented, nonchronological manner that's similar to most East Asian horror films. There's also some slight ambiguity, but only in little patches that can be filled quite easily with some common sense and logic. It's important to achieve that understanding though, because absent this understanding the viewer will never be able to appreciate the characters' suffering nor the motivations for their actions. And let me tell you, these are some of the most gloomy, disheartened, and interesting characters you'll ever see.

The acting is what we've come to expect from South Korea, first rate. Ji-hyun Jun gives one of the best performances of her entire career. She's utterly convincing in an atypical, dark role that establishes her diverse acting range once and for all. Her depression isn't presented in a typical, psychotic, over-the-top manner. It's a very restrained exhibition, even in those few cases where she suffers a mental breakdown of sorts. The film uses her character's interaction with others, a steady tone, and a longer running time (2 full hours) to slowly but surely communicate her despair to the viewer. It's impossible not to sympathize with her and hope for her recovery. The quality of acting doesn't begin and end with Ji-hyun though. Everyone comes off looking well here.

Another important point to make is that the entire foundation of this film is human suffering inflicted by humans. Contrary to what one might expect, there's really no ghostly activity present at all. Even the opening 30 minutes, which makes the film seem like it's going to travel oft-explored ghostly themes, can be interpreted as entirely psychological. Almost all of the horror sequences focus on disturbing historical events involving horrific accidents or murders that are presented in disturbing ways despite the absence of graphic violence. It might seem like an oxymoron to say that ""The Uninvited"" has more balls than the slew of vacation torture movies of recent years, but it really does trump those movies in pure guts because the acts of violence here are inflicted upon very fragile, defenseless victims. Some sequences are, in fact, jaw-dropping because most filmmakers (and their producers) are too timid to show such things.

This is a damn good film that somehow fell between the cracks during the oft-referenced (but not entirely accurate) period known as the ""hey day"" of Asian horror (circa 1998-2005).",1315267200,,3246,5.236538461538461
8372914,4,B002LFPANY,"Korean Director Su-Yeon Lee has woven a thriller that has more to do with the 1944 movie of the same name starring Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey as well as 'Rosemary's Baby' as it does J-horror like 'The Grudge'.  Jung-won is a young interior designer whose recurrent hallucinations of murdered children interfere with his work, his engagement and his sanity. He sees the apparition of a young boy sitting at his dining table so often he sets a placement for him at mealtime. Yun is a woman so burdened by psychic visions that she teeters on the verge of madness. Together they must face the enigmatic psychological terror that lies beyond the veil of reality. ""There is more to this world than is safe to know..."".  The style and pacing are reminiscent of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's excellent body of work (Cure, Seance, Retribution, Bright future) and the movie absorbs as it unfolds into a delicate conclusion without the standard cliches of the genre. Happily, it manages to avoid the shock, gore and WTF moments most Asian horror relies on for entertainment value. If you enjoyed K. Kurosawa's films or 'A Tale Of Two Sisters', I invite you to see 'The Uninvited'.",1275955200,5,1159,4.79
