1777908,4,B00006IUNX,"American Idol is a show that brought people joy for a couple of months. It was nerve racking and fun watching someone get eliminated each week hoping that your favorite was voted to stay in the contest and have their dreams come true. It was corny sometimes and it had it's commercialism, but if you ever actually watched the show you also know that it had it's sincere, unstaged moments that were true to heart. When a show comes along and sweeps over a nation, touching and inspiring those who watch, who cares about it's corny moments? Every tv show has them and this is no different, but it's a great show to watch and as someone who DID watch it, I can see why people would wanna own this DVD and relive the fun and anticipation all over again. For those of you who seem to have a problem with the show which seem to be alot of you since you seem to be so passionate about it that you would have to write a negative review, my advice is to seek a life and live it and not worry about what others are doing. For those of you who actually care about this DVD, I would suggest getting it. I think it's basically just the final episode with a bunch of special features and extras added. A great collection in every American Idol fanatic's collection. Keep your eyes peeled for the American Idol's Greatest Hits Collection October 1st, 2002.",1033171200,4,1341,4.346613545816733
1777909,1,B00006IUNX,"The ""music""(more like product industry) just won't quit dragging out mediocre talent to the masses and making money of them, will they? ""American Idol"" was the final straw in the totally corporate state of music. These people aren't groomed to have their old identity or sound or individuality but more so have to fit a standard. And the standard wasn't even high. Except for Tamyra, none of the vocalists were anything above average background vocalist level and for Pete's sake, this show was damn CHEESY!!! ""American Idol"" comes off like a microwaved ""Star Search"" with a little ""The Weakest Link"" ( both shows voted people off with a sharp-tongued British host never running out of snide remarks to make) thrown in. Like most terrible gimmicks in America, the public ate it up. The judges (Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson) were everywhere and the show became ultimate reality-television water cooler discussion (along with past reality franchises ""Survivor"", ""Fantasy Island"", and countless other programs). ""AI"" winner Kelly Clarkson quickly released a generic single in a week's time to capitalize on the ""craze"".
""AI"" revels in everything that's wrong with mainstream America:
there's no emphasis on music but looks, greed, and most strikingly: MONEY!!!",1032912000,3,1269,5.287128712871287
1777910,5,B00006IUNX,"This amazing DVD is a must have for American Idol fans. As for me, I'm not much of a fan but I purchased it as a novelty collector's item. I got it primarily because of lovely Nikki McKibbin (my favorite finalist with amazing eyes and dazzling killer smile.) I recommend this DVD to everyone! And also, thanks for voting for Nikki - close, but top three ain't bad!",1032912000,2,364,4.367647058823529
1777911,1,B00006IUNX,"I honestly can't fathom who would be the market for a DVD like this.  Couch potatoes who long for the glory years of ""Star Search?""  Or masochists who want to torture themselves even further by watching these tragically inept performances?  ""American Idol"" is another nail in the coffin of pop music, endorsing the belief that it's not about how talented you are, but how cleverly you're marketed.  Oh, I am begging you.  Please do not get this DVD.  Please.  It looks atrocious.",1032393600,6,479,4.7682926829268295
1777912,5,B00006IUNX,"This is a excellent chance to look back at a great summer show, and to see all your favorites again. I'm glad that talent won over flash for once. I'm sure all the final ten will do well, and it looks like the WINNER Kelly Clarkson is well on her way! I don't agree with the review above me by the way, because it sounds like sour grapes. Some people love a show UNTIL their pick doesn't win, and is voted off. A dvd to enjoy for sure!!",1032220800,30,436,3.965909090909091
1777923,5,B00006IUNX,"Kelly is by far the best picked so far ( besides Carrie, of course)! This dvd is awesome, I only wish that they would put ALL seasons on DVD.",1116288000,,141,3.896551724137931
1777924,5,B00006IUNX,"Even if you didn't like American Idol, you must admit that they have brought forth some of the most amazing talent that america has seen. This DVD focuses in on the main stars of the show: Ryan Starr, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Christian, Justin,Nikki, and Tamyra Grey. All of these Idols have amazing talent and are doing very well in the music world today. Kelly is still batting out music that is selling by the millions, Ryan Starr has just released another single of hers called ""My Religion"" which is doing extremely well on iTunes. Also Tamyra and Justin are entering the world of Broadway. If you are an american idol fan, buy this DVD and see where it all began, with Kelly, Ryan, Justin, Nikki, Tamyra, and others!",1113091200,3,723,4.65625
1777925,4,B00006IUNX,"I bought this d.v.d. a couple of years ago and I really loved it. The only problem was I was expecting the whole season and I didn't get that. That's why I only gave it 4 stars! It is the length of 1 episode. I love the bonus features and the bonus disk! They really rock! It has amazing performances from:Kelly Clarkson,Justin Guarini,Nikki McKibbin,Tamyra Gray,Christina Christian,and Ryan Starr! It's worth the cash! I wish they would create a d.v.d. like this for seasons 2 and 3!",1105056000,7,484,4.6395348837209305
1777926,4,B00006IUNX,"i like this DVD alot.... but they don't have at least one performance from each contestant.... that is some bull... they all deserve to have at least one performance.... they just exclude A.J., R.J., EJay, and jim.... in my opinion, they gave justin WAY WAY too many performances...

anyways.... by far the best performance that i love to death AND cried with paula: ""a house is not a home'. that powerhouse voice blew me away the first time i heard it live and i can watch it now... still one of the best televised performances of our generation...PERIOD! tamyra was the best performer on that show... it should have been tamyra vs. kelly to be honest but its over now..

the DVD does not disappoint especially with brilliant performances:

'without u' & 'natural woman' kelly clarkson
'if you really loved me' ryan starr
'mary jane' nikki mckibbin
'lets stay together' justin guarini

ohh and cannot forget the finale performance with kelly singing 'for a moment like this' and she could not sing an edgewise.... but it was heartwarming.

one of the few things that does P me off about this DVD is not judges critics.... that is why we love simon and i want to relive what he said especially about nikki.... i love nikki she is one of my favourite performers in AI history but i want to hear what he said about her.... and i want to watch the fight against randy and simon about r.j. going to the finals...

overall this is what they should release DVDs instead of a cd with wack songs.....the performances are more memerable than the cd....

4.2 stars- just wish they put everyone on there",1105056000,,1592,4.604240282685512
1777927,4,B00006IUNX,"In the words of Randy, this DVD, ""Did it's thang dawg!""  I absolutely loved it. I only have one complaint about it.  First, this movie didn't show many of the performances by the singers (they don't show ANY of EJay's and Jim's performance, not even in the extra features).  They should have a section of EVERY performance by all of the singers, even in the Top 30.
Overall, this DVD was absolutely amazing.  Brain was extremely funny in many sections of the show.  I loved that section with the judges (I think it's called ""When Judges Attack.""). Wonderful!
But there's one more thing, why don't they have Season 2 and Season 3???",1087603200,,631,4.598214285714286
1777928,1,B00006IUNX,"First of all, this show sucks in every single way that it is possible for a show to suck. They have run the gamut. You have your reality TV suck-factor (ALL ""reality"" TV shows are utterly dispicable), your arrogant, pompous, condescending, prissy, whiny, obnoxious, needs-to-just-keel-over-and-die British retard suck-factor (Simon, of course), your cutesy, trendy, demographically appealing American host with perpetually disheveled hair suck-factor (Ryan Seacrest, who I also hate), your long-irrelevant, obsolete, washed-up has-been who suddenly inexplicably feels she has a right to rate others suck-factor (the never-talented Paula Abdul), and of course then there's the contestants, who (whether they can sing or not) invariably pick the most inane, tepid, lame, schlocky, redundant, idiotic, pointless songs you could ever be unfortunate enough to hear on the worst lite-rock station in Kansas. ANYBODY who likes the kind of music they promote on ""American Idol"" needs to be tossed to the lions, and supposing Hell exists, I cannot imagine a better group of people to condemn to it than the people responsible for this show, which provides us all with a little slice of Hell here on earth. AMERICAN IDOL SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1087344000,,1230,5.5132275132275135
1777949,2,B00006IUNX,"I consider myself to be an avid fan of American Idol. I came across the first season by accident, when I was sitting at home on a Tuesday night, and happened to turn on the tv to FOX. Ryan Star was singing at the time. When I heard that they came out with a DVD on American Idol, I assumed that it would be the ENTIRE SEASON. I was mistaken! Out of the 10 top finalists, you only get to view 5 out of the 10 do at least one solo performance. Kelly and Justin do 3-4, Niki does 2, Tamyra does one, and Christina Richin does 1. The DVD did a lot of recaps and behind the scenes, but still it wasn't enough to be worth while. It's ovious that American Idol is a hit, and the producers should think highly of doing a COMPLETE SEASON set of BOTH the FIRST & SECOND season!!",1085875200,,768,3.9612903225806453
1777950,3,B00006IUNX,"Now I like American Idol as much as the next person, but i have to say, when I look back at season 1 I see how untalented most of them were.  What this disc is, is a feature program featuring the entire season pushed into about an hour.  Hence the first problem.  You don't even see 4 of the 10 finalists perform.  The performances you do get to see are Ryan Starr, 2 from Justin, 2 from Nikkie, 4 from Kelly, and the ultimate American Idol performance, past, present, & future, Tamyra Grey singing A House Is Not A Home.
Some extras include a lot of wacky auditions, the Pasadena experience, and a tour the idols home.  The second disk is pointless.  Its mostly a bunch of producers talking about the show, not to mention an embarasingly stupid segment with Justin Guarini.  They need to get rid of this cheap stuff, and come out with a full season dvd package.  Fox would be making some money then.",1085097600,2,900,4.347305389221557
1777951,4,B00006IUNX,"I thought that I was buying the WHOLE season of American Idol when it was on some of the best performances, but the good thing is that there is alot of behind the sence stuff.",1081468800,,175,4.0285714285714285
1777952,5,B00006IUNX,"I have enjoyed it so far. Alot of people thought it was cheap(As in not good),but I payed $1.75 for mine BRAND NEW from Amazon,so how much should one expect from a brand new DVD that cheap??. It has some AWESOME footage,not only of the show,but it also takes you behind the scenes. It shows you the Cast in the 6 million dollar mansion they got to stay in.
It also shows some of the worst auditions (For example,this one guy came in wearing NOTHING but his underwear and sung a song about a man in his underwear....Then there's this other guy who didn't know the words to the song HE wrote himself,so he had to read them off a piece of paper),and 2 ladies who didn't want to take no for an answer. There's also footage of Kelly's Audition in Dallas,Texas..including her switching places with judge Randy Jackson.
In addition,it shows the judge narrowing it down from 45 hopefulls to the 30 who would be seen on the premiere. Of course,it also has footage from EACH show. It has footage of the contestants singing together(They sung ""That's What Friends Are For"",""California Dreamin"",and ""Joy To The World""),and singing individually.
This is a MUST-SEE for anyone who missed the first season,when Kelly won,or who just want to see some of the BEST backstage footage EVER. You'll laugh,you'll cry,and best of all-you'll get to know our American Idol-Kelly Clarkson.",1081296000,,1363,4.755274261603375
1777953,1,B00006IUNX,"Hardly any performances.  If you watch this video, you would wonder why the show was such a hit.  All of this video could have taken place in 1 night.  There was no suspense, no tension of watching your favorite move on or move out.  And the 2 DVD set is an even BIGGER disappointment.  In Simon-speak, it's dreadfully, absolutely dreadful!",1070928000,2,340,4.6
1777954,4,B00006IUNX,"This was my first DVD, so initially I was all excited because I didn't know any better. I mean, this had to have been done in a rush. The first season of American Idol had so many wonderful performances and I just don't understand why the makers wanted to be so stingy about supplying us, the fans, with those performances! There is one performance for each finalist except for EJ, AJ, and RJ. There are two performances each for Kelly, Justin, and Nikki. I know Christina Christian didn't make the top three (which she should've) but the DVD would've been much better if there were more performances by her (especially her rendition of Glory Of Love). There are a few group songs that are good, the bonus extras are fine, but the entire thing could've been much better. With the low price, it's still worth  buying though.",1070323200,2,823,4.598639455782313
1777955,3,B00006IUNX,"I like you, you beatuful but has no lice.  My favorite song, Snappy Relations, makes glad my kid but not so much Low Rider.  Low Rider has favorite ending, Dennis Hopper did good mock up.  Oh boi!  I have no Kelly Clarkson pictures on my wall, I have no pleasure!  Simon needs torture, possibly paper-cutting his pee-hole and sprinkling salt into his oh boi!  Explosive, snappy cutting and editing sound colleges, I attend no university any more, highlight.",1065830400,,457,4.794871794871795
1777956,1,B00006IUNX,"I purchased this DVD and boy was I disappointed.  The production looks like it was a rushed job.  Very little content and no substance.  The only information I got out of this is that the final contestants of AI2 were so much better than those of AI1.  I watched this once and have no desire to watch it ever again.
I am looking forward to an AI2 DVD but I hope they would do a much better job than the above-mentioned DVD.  Of course being a Clay fan, I hope to see more of him in the DVD.
For now, I can only say that the AI1 DVD is a disappointment and a complete waste of my money.",1064793600,,585,3.9237288135593222
1777967,3,B00006IUNX,"I was very excited about the new American Idol DVD, and then was immediately disappointed that it was nothing but a cheap montage of the 2002 season.  There was really no added commentary, no bloopers, no priceless moments.  Then I realized, all at once, how sad a human being I truly am--for sitting there in my pajamas and hoping for some added tidbit of sordid human embarrassment.  The DVD was a downer, but I've decided to change my life.  Tomorrow I begin jogging and eating right; and I'm going to stop wearing those miserable sweaters that Simon always wears.",1059091200,,567,4.696969696969697
1777968,1,B00006IUNX,"I really didn't care much for the DVD, there needs to be more footage from the show.  they only have about 40 minutes of show stuff from a show, that was 2-3 hours a week for over three months.
but the bonus features make it worth buying, if you like American Idol.
if you're looking for mostly footage from the show, don't buy it.

it you're looking for lot's of interesting bonus stuff, buy it.",1057708800,,396,4.266666666666667
1777969,5,B00006IUNX,"I don't watch much TV so I got this tape.  What I learned: American Idol competition is brutal.  A number of talented people don't make the final cut and seeing the video you can see why.  They expect each contestant to sing different styles of music each week e.g. 60's, 70's, big band, and country.  It's obvious there are talents that have only a certain style they are best in e.g. rock.  What can be glimpsed from this VHS is that Tamyra Gray and Christina Christian gave really gooood performances.  Gray reminds me of Whitney Houston and Christian not only has a lovely voice but a great stage presence.  Even got Simon Cromwell to say he's in love with her.  It was also saddening to see the people who left that had so much to dream for e.g. one guy who made it up to the top had parents that were deaf and another just wanted to support her mom and make her proud.  Makes one realize there are really great kids out there that are not just talented but also good.",1056931200,,973,4.302197802197802
1777970,1,B00006IUNX,"Most of the reviewers have summed up the terrible content of this DVD, so I'd like to comment on the quality of the video footage itself.  The sound quality is terrible!  I had to watch the DVD with my finger on the volume control the entire time.  Basically, it would go from blaring loud to whisper quiet (there were a few scenes that I couldn't hear any of the )conversation with the volume turned way up.  Sure, I bet they were in a hurry to get this one out, but don't waste your time and money watching it.",1056672000,2,512,4.1938775510204085
1777971,4,B00006IUNX,"I started watching ""American Idol"" the week after Tamyra Grey was booted off the show.  I teach a Popular Culture class so I figured I was going to have to know who Justin Guarini was and why he did not like Simon Cowell.  What I discovered during those final episodes was that it was obvious that Kelly Clarkson should win the competition and that in our house we usually agree with Simon's comments.  Oh, and that Brian Dunkleman and Ryan Seacrest were two clowns trying to do a job that only required one clown (Seacrest is ten times better this year not having to try to outshine Dunkleman).  So when I checked out this ""American Idol"" DVD it was a combination of seeing what I had missed (Gray's performance of ""A House Is Not a Home"" and what the finalists did to qualify in the first place) and what I wanted to see again (Clarkson unable to make it all the way through ""A Moment Like This"" after she won and singing a duet with her idol Reba McIntire).  Consequently, like most people who watch this DVD I got some of what I wanted, but not as much as I hoped.
I really think the producers of this ""American Idol"" recap was geared more for a 90-minute videotape than for taking full advantage of what you can cram on a DVD (oh, and cutting something out as quickly as possible).  The limited chapter search does focus on the songs, organized by who sang them, but there are only 15 songs and I really assumed that the DVD would go way beyond what we had from the CD.  The focus is more on the competition, so that we get clips of each of the nine verdicts being read along the way and it is not until the final couple of decisions that you get to hear what American had to choose between on that particular night.  For the most part the focus is also on the performers rather than the judges; most of those fun moments between the judges and the contestants (and each other) are part of the extra features (pay attention as you go through these options because they loop back on each other in strange ways).  The emphasis is also on the top three, who are the only finalists to get more than one song.
Since I missed most of the first season of ""American Idol"" there was more ""new"" stuff for me to see than those who rode the roller coaster the whole way.  So when I get to hear Christina Christian sing ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" I am ahead of the game but I also know that I also wanted to hear a lot more of the songs these kids sang.  As for Simon, not only do I usually agree with his opinions more than those of Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, but I also would rather hear his few choice positive comments preserved than a constant barrage of his caustic comments.  He probably told every single one of these kids that they could do better, so where is that golden moment when he says after a performance that for the first time he is looking at them and thinking ""American Idol""?  I am not going to take the extreme position that we need the entire season of the show available on DVD ..., but 90 minutes is just too damn brief.  Then again, I suppose it is because of this DVD that Fox did not rerun the series on FX.",1045699200,43,3126,4.2407407407407405
1777972,1,B00006IUNX,"I really enjoyed the amazing singing on American Idol, and hoped to see it again in this video. Unfortunately it mostly focuses on the process of choosing the Idol, and doesn't show many of the great singing moments. If you want to see some of those moments, you are better off buying the compilation video.",1040860800,,307,4.6
1777973,3,B00006IUNX,"Don't the producers fo this DVD know that you can fit A LOT of footage on a disc?  What we have here can not even be described as a ""greatest hits"" version of the Fox talent search.  I am not asking to see every moment of every show (though that would be nice), but one can not help but notice what is NOT on this DVD at times.  First, the positives than a short list of some of the more glaring omissions/negatives:
PROS:  1) The sometimes stunning transformations of the players, some serious makeovers with Kelly particularly ""cleaning"" up well; 2) Kelly's touching performance of ""A Moment Like This"" after being named the American Idol; 3) Justin's performance of the same song during the finals and realizing just how much Kelly ""made it her own""; 4) Tamyra's knockout performance of  ""A House Is Not A Home""; 5) Fun outtakes from those otherwise cheesy Ford Focus plugs; 6) Highlights of judge and performer comebacks from the tryouts (including the still-bleeped, but still-hilarious, ""Ta-mee-ka"" tirade).
CONS: 1) We have multiple selections from finalists Kelly and Justin, but why leave out their signature performances of ""Respect"" and ""Get Here""? 2) Only one solo from Tamyra - though she faired better than RJ, AJ, E-Jay, and Jim who do not even show up on the DVD with a solo performance; 3) We see the finalists trying out for the show and their joy in ""going to Hollywood"" - but not the audition performance that earned them the trip; 4) The omnipresence of  Seacrest and Dunkleman... ugh, NOT the stars of the show.
With the fairly low price of this DVD and on the heels of the sub-par ""Greatest Hits"" CD released earlier this year, I guess we should not have expected that much.  The post-Idol marketing machine appears to be all about getting a product out the door as quickly as possible.  I do not discourage American Idol fanatics from buying this DVD, but just gently warn that it is selected highlights and is sure to be lacking at least one of your ""greatest"" moments from the show.",1038355200,29,2008,4.6525423728813555
1777974,3,B00006IUNX,"This DVD is Good, nice behind the scenes coverage, the finalists singing altogether. it included a few complete songs for the 10 finalists but one finalist they didn;t play his song was RJ
How come they played two songs for Nikki, NIkki is  a cool singer, but so is RJ, AJ and EJ, i thought i was gonna see their performances, but not unfortuanetly, and the auditions. all that was showing in the auditions, was  ""you're comiing to hollywood""
and "" you're going to holly wood"" we want to hear the contestants auditioning, the good contestants, not just the worse contestants

I got this as a gift and when I read the back it seemed really neat because it claimed to show the finalists full aditions and everything, but when I put it in, I searched all the bonus footage and watched the actual ""show"" and only found clips of the finalists but not very much singing at all.  The producers obviously were in a rush to get this DVD out in stores because the just didn't put in a lot of the good performances.  The only good part I say would be is the trivia footage, and that too was only about a minute long.",1037750400,,593,3.966386554621849
1777976,2,B00006IUNX,"Not being in the States, I wanted to get a glimpse of why this series became the hottest TV sensation of the summer of 2002. This is such a poorly pieced together effort, and viewers who didn't get to see the show will end up being confused about a lot of things.
For one thing, they rarely place the contestants' names onscreen, so for a first time viewer, it gets rather confusing who's who.
Secondly, you're left wondering why the top 10 were eliminated in the order that they go. Most of the time, you don't even see/hear even a few seconds of their performance that night, and you never get to hear what the judges think about them (except once, and that time, it wasn't even a critical comment).
On one particular elimination, the person voted off wasn't even present at the show, and all you saw were a few seconds of her being taken away in an ambulance. No explanations were given, so one doesn't know if she had an accident, an asthma attack, a stroke or whatever... not even if she got out of the hospital alive. It's really frustrating.
The bonus features save this DVD from receiving a one-star rating, since they're a lot more fun than the actual 62 minute program. It makes you think that if they had integrated the additional footage into the main feature (particularly the scenes with the judges fighting), then it would've been a bit more entertaining. And seriously, would at least ONE performance from each top 10 finalist have been too much to ask for?",1035676800,4,1473,4.541353383458647
1777987,3,B00006IUNX,"This video could easily have been 2 hours and should have been.  It is only 60 minutes long.  It should have included more of the auditions (at least auditions of the final 10 if not others) and judges' comments.  They should also have included the final ten singing together in the last show.  Instead we are shown tiny clips of the various shows.  They do not show everyone singing.  We get songs from Kelly (natch), Justin, Tamyra, Nicki, Christina, and R.J.  They also show when people are voted off and the clips they showed about that person when they were voted off.  It also has the group sing-a-long of ""California Dreamin'.""If you didn't know before why Kelly won, it is abundantly clear when Justin sings (or tries to) ""A Moment Like This.""  Kelly's winning moment is there and she sings ""A Moment Like This"" after she is crowned American Idol.  This makes up for the shortcomings of the video.  They could have included so much more and for the amount I paid I expected them to.  I guess that's why they didn't put the total running time on the package.",1035331200,8,1065,4.5473684210526315

editing various parts of the show to give you a general feeling of what went on, especially covering all of the kids who didn't make the top ten (what would have been nice would be if they'd had a section on the LAS VEGAS show utilizing all 30 contestants).  The hour long section on the series itself is an edited version of the final episode, with various cuts and ads...
the special sections are all fun viewing.  If you loved AMERICAN IDOL on TV, you'll definately LOVE this DVD!",1035158400,,669,4.244094488188976
1777990,1,B00006IUNX,"This video stunk. There was nothing on the video that wasn't aired on TV, and only a few full-length performances. There were no full-length (or even half-length) clips of those goofy Ford Focus skits or their other behind-the-scenes things like when they built the house for Habitat for Humanity. They had very brief clips of them--but the clips were only about 5 seconds long. That's not enough time to enjoy American Idol. They didn't show any of the judges much, nor the judges' comments, and no interviews with the contestants or fights between the contestants and the judges. The closest it got to showing arguments was a quick clip of Justin turning to the audience and saying, ""I respect your opinion, Simon, but what do you guys think?"" and also Randy getting out of his seat and asking Simon if he wanted to fight. However, they left out many entertaining parts of the show, and didn't show Justin's apology. The whole video, being only an hour long and full of boring footage, was a big disappointment. It contained about 5 performances, such as Tamyra Gray singing ""A House is Not a Home"", and clips of people being voted off, with little clips of footage shown on TV about the contestants (like soundless 5-second clips of behind-the-scenes stuff, and Jim signing to his deaf parents). Save your money and buy the DVD instead--with all the extras, it's sure to be better. (Plus, I hear there's Easter eggs in the DVD!) Don't waste your money or an hour watching this boring video.",1034812800,5,1493,4.746153846153846

They made this for all the 14 year olds who love Justin. So, if you're a 14 year old who loves Justin... this is the dvd for you.

He has something that draws you to him, and a beautiful voice of course.  He is the best thing to come along since sliced bread!  Seriously, I now know what beatlemania felt like...and thank you god for bringing Justin to all of us!  Get this DVD!  A day in the life of Justin is reason enough at last. This is coming from a 30 yr. old woman, by the way!  He brings out the 12yr old girl in me, what can I say!",1034640000,4,563,4.018018018018018

Far better then any of the other seasons since, but this DVD does not offer enough it is a nice recap of the show but not a good enough look back. I wish they had done it more like the ""Pop Idol: A Star Is Born"" DVD in which they go through the whole season quickly but show 4 or 5 of the performances from each week until the Final 5 when all of their final performances are shown. The DVD would be much better had it followed that format. The DVD is still fun to watch but could be better. I wish there were more Nikki McKibbin performance's",1140048000,4,600,4.050420168067227

7969622,5,B00006IUNX,"As a professional singer and Voice Teacher, I am so thrilled to see how American Idol has given the art of singing such a jump start in these last few years.

These American Idol programs are filled with so much varying talents. From Hard rock to Country, America is becoming interested in identifying true talent. As an Opera Singer myself I can still enjoy the gifts of other genres and am sad to hear when others look down upon the show. Also, as a voice teacher of many styles I can't stress enough the need to my own students for them to develop themselves as a ""Complete Unique Package"". Finding their own true niche and style including: voice type, genre, best repertoire, to the the right audition outfit. American Idol teaches the same theories. Be true to yourself and your voice to get your best shot at this business of singing. I am an advocat for AI and all shows that encourage the high developement of arts in America. We come from a society that watched sports religiously on telievision (which is great) but there are so many talents to support including singing out there amongst us. American Idol gives artists and viewers a fantastic opportunity.",1123545600,4,1167,4.665048543689321
