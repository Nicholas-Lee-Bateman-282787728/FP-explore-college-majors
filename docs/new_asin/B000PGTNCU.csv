2818715,5,B000PGTNCU,"Robson Green always delivers a fine performance, and this charming but dated series is full of laughter as well as poignant moments.  See Robson Green before he made 'Wire in the Blood' or 'Touched by Evil.'

You'll enjoy the entire cast in this wonderfully weaved story of a chaotic dysfunctional family with parallel views of upper crust dysfunctional characters.",1220659200,,365,5.169491525423729
2818716,1,B000PGTNCU,ordered months ago. contacted them at least 4 times . never responded. never got product. grrrrr.,1207699200,,97,5.125
2818717,4,B000PGTNCU,"Every reason to watch this is well expressed by others here, so I'll just point out that although the first season has its own satisfying conclusion, you'll want to know what becomes of these characters longer term.  Go straight to the second season - it doesn't leave you hanging and it is the perfect compliment to the first.  If anything it raises the stakes.  Enough said - don't miss.",1205539200,2,389,4.608695652173913
2818718,5,B000PGTNCU,"Grafters"" (series 1&2) was one of the best and funniest series on British Television. Goodness knows how they managed to get any work done because of all the distractions! Could watch it again and again. Highly recommended.",1200787200,6,223,5.054054054054054
2818719,5,B000PGTNCU,"This is a wonderful series about the love and hate that can flow between siblings.  Joe and Trevor Purvis are from Newcastle, Joe's an experienced builder, Trevor his out-of-work younger brother who's done a bit of home improvement, but not much more.  Joe brings Trevor to London with him to restore a large Victorian house near the river for a couple, Laura and Paul.

The brothers' relationship is very complex from the start and is only made more complex by many of the situations that they encounter during the job, including the breakup of Trevor's marriage and falling in lust with the wrong women.  Trevor must work constantly to try and prove to Joe that he's not ""crap"" at building and Joe has to learn to deal better with his responsibility for his choices and actions, both in his own broken marriage and in his relationship to his family.

There is much comedy and drama along the way, and the performances are consistently good.  Stephen Tompkinson's Trevor seems pathetic at times, but there is a core of strength that emerges when it's needed.  Robson Green's Joe is a very tightly wound individual, full of ambitions and a drive to succeed, a volatile temper, though he will eventually be brought round to his senses by reason.  Also Emily Joyce, known also for her excellent comedic work in My Hero, among other things, shows her dramatic chops, as well as her delightfully mischievous side as Laura, the beautiful and slightly gullible wife who has bought the house with her husband Paul(Neil Stuke), a slightly slimy and stuck-up shipping engineer.

I highly recommend this series, and hope that they will bring out series 2 on DVD Region 1 soon!",1188172800,10,1666,4.7972027972027975

8191243,5,B000PGTNCU,I am totally in love with Geordie actor Robson Greene and this series is great.  Stephen Tompkinson is excellent in his supporting role as Robson Greene's brother.  They are a pair of gypsy builders - Robson's character is the impulsive of the two so chaos results.,1467072000,,265,4.739130434782608
8191244,5,B000PGTNCU,"Received this DVD set the same day as Season 2 and ended up ""binge watching"" until 5 in the morning.  Just had to see how these battling brothers ended up.  This is a very sometimes funny, sometimes sad series.  Robson Green and Stephen Tompkinson are great together.",1466121600,,267,4.638297872340425
8191245,1,B000PGTNCU,"Funny? On what planet is this funny? Two brothers who fight constantly, are dishonest and cheat. NO one in this is amusing much less funny. Want to see funny? Get Father Ted or My Hero. This is a waste of time.",1423353600,,210,4.146341463414634
8191246,5,B000PGTNCU,"This first season is like a great book that you just cannot put down. We get to know the two Purvis brothers, are amazed that they can stand each other for even one whole day, and realize that Trevor (Tompkinson) is the gentle one, Joe (Green) is the older brother and always feels he's right and Trevor's wrong. The point is Trevor tries his very best to do his very best and you admire him for that. Joe has his own issues, but even cruel words, fights with each other, and outright bullying of Joe over Trevor, you realize that they do love each other, and with the help of their dad, you know they do. The ever-wonderful Maurice Roeves from, ""Danger UXB"", plays their dad, and is funny and takes each son aside to let them know that they are family and they have to stick together.......................he's also one of the best actors around. To have all of this excellent talent in one series is amazing. Buy this one and enjoy.",1399334400,,934,4.436046511627907

8191248,5,B000PGTNCU,I enjoyed this series very much.  The characters are interesting and funny.  Green and Thompkinson work well together and make their characters believable.,1386374400,,155,5.695652173913044
8191249,5,B000PGTNCU,I love Robson Green and that's all that needs to be said.  I love all his acting roles and he's the best,1384732800,,104,3.727272727272727
8191250,5,B000PGTNCU,I Purchassed the intire collection..love  it these two are really good together..I wish more of Tompkinson's movies would be USA and Canada  Format.,1368057600,,148,5.391304347826087
8191251,4,B000PGTNCU,"I'm crazy about Robson Green (Reckless) and Stephen Tompkinson (Ballykissangel) and so would watch just about anything they do (except the boring crime scene stuff which I really don't like which sadly is all they seem to be in these days.) This series is entertaining but is not on the same level as far as writing goes with the other things these guys starred in mentioned above. That being said, it is still enjoyable and for anyone who has survived a house renovation, it's particularly amusing at times. I wish these two guys would get a chance to work together again in something that wasn't about serial killers and psychopaths. They're great actors.",1365033600,2,657,4.823008849557522
