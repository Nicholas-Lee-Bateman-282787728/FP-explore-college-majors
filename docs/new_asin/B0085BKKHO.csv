5132766,5,B0085BKKHO,"This movie is fantastic!  Takes you through World Cup DH in europe, dirt jumps in Cali, incredible free riding in Utah, and amazing downhill in Whistler just to name a few.  BluRay & DVD pack is great, because you get both DVDs and even a free download to watch on your PC.  I've watched many times over, and it inspires me to have fun with my friends riding and to continually get better and push my limits.  Highly recommend!",1339977600,,427,4.367088607594937
5132767,5,B0085BKKHO,"I have watched many different bike movies and this one takes the cake.  I could watch this movie on repeat.  Phenomenal camera work, excellent soundtrack, impressive riding from dirt jumping to downhill racing.  The phantom camera slow-mo shots on bluray are jaw dropping.  This contains the bluray, dvd, and digital download editions so you can watch it anywhere.",1339113600,4,364,5.224137931034483

8525484,5,B0085BKKHO,"I was very happy when I got my movie, it worth every penny and the quality, music, sound and history is perfect!!!",1396224000,,114,4.2272727272727275
8525485,2,B0085BKKHO,"Plenty of action in this packed DVD, and very well made!  It makes you feel like going riding and almost doing those tricks the Pro's can do (they make it look so easy)  However, I'm an adrenalin-junkie and next to my Dirtbike, Surfing, and Snowboarding vids, I'll have to rate this vid a 2 stars product.  The video is very well made and action packed but next to my other vids this is what I'd rate it at!  The extra features was actually almost better than the video its self, but thats just me sayin'.  I'm sure anyone will enjoy this video!",1389312000,,545,4.303921568627451

8525487,5,B0085BKKHO,My husband's words exactly.  Bought it for father's day for him.  He was so excited about it.  I have to admit most MTB videos are over priced and worth only one watch.  This one is better priced and I believe I've watched it 3 times since father's day.  We have a bunch of these videos and he is pretty picky and a MTB-aholic.,1371686400,,327,4.126984126984127
8525488,5,B0085BKKHO,Lots of really great riding. I love this video. I like to watch this before I go mountain biking to get pumped up.,1368316800,,114,4.0
8525489,5,B0085BKKHO,"I loved this movie because it was very well done. Ant Hill and Redbull did a great job with shooting and editing this movie as far as multiple angles, screenplay, and music choice. Great job to the producers and mountain bikers of this film!",1367712000,,241,4.5
8525490,5,B0085BKKHO,Great music and great flow to the video.  I have all the other new videos out right now and this was by far the best!  Pumps me up every time!  Don't hesitate to purchase it!!,1359504000,,175,3.942857142857143
8525491,5,B0085BKKHO,"had all the elements, felt like it was over too quick but thats just caus the trails are so good you lose track of time",1359417600,,119,3.8
8525492,4,B0085BKKHO,Not my favorite video but I love all biking videos and it is nice to have the digital copy (although for some reason I can't transfer it to my ipad). The quality is really nice on the Blueray.,1354492800,,192,4.078947368421052
