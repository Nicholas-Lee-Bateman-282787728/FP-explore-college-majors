An automobile travels along a country road. Two women are in it. A man rides a horse to tell three men about this car. Elsewhere two men ride along and sing. The three men question the woman driver about her destination. They ride after her, shooting at her tires. Those two riders arrive to shoot back at those three men! The three men ride away. Happy will change the flat tire. Tom Wade and Happy are lawmen. The villains report to their boss. An old man is a prisoner, he is the father of Miss Rita. A man arrives with a message for her. He cleverly insinuates that Tom and Happy staged that hold up! Tom talks to the local lawman.

Rita and Minnie check to see if they are followed, then speed away. They are stopped by a log in the road, Tom questions Rita. One of the gangs members uses Mr. Carrolls ring as an introduction, but the presence of Tom prevents a meeting. Those three men ride up and attack Tom, who fights back until he is knocked out. Happy arrives too late. The gang takes Miss Carroll away on a horse. Tom and Happy follow the trail of tire tracks. Miss Carroll drops small beads to mark her trail. They take her to her father. Mr. Carroll explains the situation, he suspected the ranch was used for smuggling. So the gang took him prisoner. The gang tries to shoot Happy, he takes shelter by a rock, they exchange shots. Tome rides up to help him. Miss Carroll will write a note to her maid saying they are all right.

Carson is told Tom and Happy are alive, one of their men is dead. Ritas note is delivered to Minnie, it says they left for the East and to call off the search. Minnie shows the note to Tom. The clue is in the mention of the white bead bag! They will follow the clues of the beads at dawns light. They locate the gangs hideout. Tom silences the man on guard. But another of the gang frees him and they go to the ranch. Tom gets the drop on Carson and the other gang members. Mr Carroll tells Tom about the smuggling from that ranch. The other two gang members arrive, there is a big fight. Tom wins. The Sheriff arrives to arrest the gang. And so it ends.

They don't mention what was being smuggled across the border, or the source and destination. In some of the early scenes the name Ann is used to refer to Rita. This movie has a clever plot, even if they skimped on actors and their costs. Was this movie edited to shorten it to an hour? One educational part is the used of plain language to hide a coded message.",1506556800,,2484,4.21218487394958
