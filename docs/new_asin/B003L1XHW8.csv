8399277,5,B003L1XHW8,Want to learn about our history just by watching TV then this is the product for you.  I originally found this at The Smithsonian in their gift shop.  It was way to expensive and thanks to my phone internet I found it on Amazon quickly for way less.  This is totally worth every penny.  Especially if you went to public school and didn't learn a single thing about American History.,1384560000,,382,4.414285714285715
8399278,5,B003L1XHW8,"We absolutely love these DVD's.  I purchased them for my husband, who is a Revolutionary War ""history buff"" and we have enjoyed watching them multiple times.  The founders of our nation are portrayed as real people with faults and strengths.  After seeing the real stories, we're even more thankful for the nation that arose out of that horrible conflict.",1331424000,3,355,4.983050847457627
8399279,4,B003L1XHW8,This is a great collection of History Channel productions on America's history.  It's great for kids and grown-ups.  We all can use a reminder of how this great country got the way it did.  We should be proud of and knowledgeable about our country and these videos help bring the story to life.  Highly recommended. Great value.,1282435200,8,328,4.701754385964913
8399280,5,B003L1XHW8,"For about the last year I've had the History Channel set The Revolution in my shopping cart / saved section just waiting to add it on to a small item for free shipping. Alas, I never was short of the $25 limit so it just sat there. I was happy but skeptical when this mega set (which includes The Revolution) popped up on my suggestions at just under $70. I was skeptical since it includes so much good stuff that I thought maybe it was some sort of bootleg or Region 2 discs or something. I checked out the seller ""forgetthegouge"" and other than some folks complaining about slow shipping times there were no issues so I took the bait on June 5th and it arrived on June 10th (so no problem with the shipping to me, anyway). I was expecting a stack of 13 separate discs but was happy that it is its own boxed set with the discs each in fold-out holders. The set appears to have been a retail set (one of the store alarm sensors was inside) and I wonder if it is from a close-out, perhaps from Media Play or one of the many companies that have gone out of business in this recession / depression, whatever the heck it is. I have not yet played the discs but they appear genuine and I'm looking forward to viewing them. Once I do I'll try to update this review as a content review as well (but 27 hours is a lot of video to watch so it may be a while!) In any case, I wanted to post this review to let anyone looking at this purchase know that it seems genuine and to be a genuinely good deal!

Update 7-4-10 / Content - So far I have watched Founding Fathers, Founding Brothers as well as the Washington the Warrior and parts of The Revolution and I am impressed. This is typical History Channel fare which I feel is well done and infuses history with an energy that keeps the viewer entertained and will appeal to young and old alike.

I note today, July 4th, that oddly someone has found this review unhelpful for a ""score"" of 0 out of 1. Not sure what is unhelpful about the information above - I would have loved to see this review before buying this just to know that these discs are the ""real deal"" and an excellent deal at that.",1276214400,36,2134,4.177184466019417
