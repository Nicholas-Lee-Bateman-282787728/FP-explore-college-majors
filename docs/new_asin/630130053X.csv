331308,5,630130053X,Amazing movie and the only good Halloween sequel after 2 and before H20. The fourth movie is highly underrated in my opinion and lives up to the story set up in Halloween 1 and 2. Expect occasional cheesey dialogue typical of the late 80s,1494028800,,238,4.431818181818182

331321,5,630130053X,"This was the last good Halloween sequel until Rob Zombie`s acquired taste reboots. It sucks that the other sequels are so embarrassingly awful but on the plus side its crazy how it worked out with this one and the first two working as an awesome trilogy with this one having a kick ass wicked ending to close off the trilogy. The ending really is something. Just a shame they didn't do anything with it for the next sequels. Halloween 4 definitely holds its own with the first two and is just as well made. It has a very similar feel, tone and atmosphere to the first two (which is why it works so well obviously) and characters you care about. The cast and performances are rock solid with assistance from great directing by the underrated Dwight H. Little. My recommendation is to strictly watch parts 1, 2 and this one ONLY!",1454112000,2,827,4.483443708609271

331347,5,630130053X,"Following the events of Halloween 2, in which Michael Myers was thought to be dead turns out to only be in a deep coma and is being transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium via ambulance. During the ride, Michael overhears that he has a 7 year old niece; Jamie Lloyd, who's being cared for by her foster sister, Rachel, which wakes him from his long coma, killing the paramedics in the process and heads back to Haddonfield in pursuit of her.

Meanwhile, Michael's former psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, who also seems to have survived the events of H2, learns of Michael's escape and is hot on the silent killer's trail to track him down before he kills innocent little Jamie. Can Loomis stop Michael before the unhinged masked murderer kills Jamie?

Overall: What a return for Michael Myers! After die-hard fans whined up a storm about Michael Myer's absence in Halloween 3 and absolutely destroyed H3 with a multitude of negative remarks, John Carpenter was left with ultimately no choice but to cancel his original plans for the future of the Halloween series and go back to the drawing board. While I'm one of the few who actually really loved Halloween 3, Halloween 4 was a great way to bring back Michael Myers and being the early stages of portraying him as someone who may no longer be superhuman but supernatural. What I love about this movie is how Michael is even more merciless and unforgiving in this one than the first 2. I won't give away the kill scenes but they turn it up a notch with some of them. We also get a refreshing story that adds another layer to the Halloween storyline. The story is no longer Michael/Laurie, but Michael/Jamie. Overall, it's a really good way to tell the story of Michael Myers' return. I'm not a big fan of the Halloween series, but part 4 definitely makes my top 5",1446076800,2,1807,4.608695652173913
331348,5,630130053X,"Michael Myers may have returned but Jamie Lee Curtis refused to oblige, having become a BIG star.  So they did the only sensible thing they could and killed off her character Laurie Strode, in the bowels of history.  Somewhere along the way, while no one was looking, she mothered a daughter, Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd.  The poor little orphan was shopped-out to the Carruthers family, where she keeps getting in the way of her faux sister's fun (Ellie Cornell as Rachel Carruthers).  Meanwhile, a comatose Michael wakes from his long slumber and heads back to Haddonfield, leaving a lot of bodies in his wake.  To no surprise, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) also survived the fiery blast that Carpenter and Hill had designed to finish off the pair in Halloween II.
What can be done, can be undone.  And so Michael spends another Halloween decimating a police force and destroying a power substation, plunging the town into carefully controlled darkness.  Those who aren't murdered rally to make another vain attempt to destroy Michael for good.  But.  Unfortunately.  ""You can't kill damnation, mister.""
Bless their hearts, they do keep trying.",1445299200,,1153,5.021052631578947

331364,5,630130053X,"This is one of my favorite Halloween movies, and and it's original, introduces new characters, including Jamie Lloyd, one of my favorite protagonists portrayed by Danielle Harris in her first movie.  Dr. Sam Loomis returns once again portrayed by Donald Pleasence, who only has a scar on his face from being in the explosion in Halloween II.  Michael is back, and he is cool, but the mask is terrible.  In my opinion, it is the 2nd worst mask in the series, only in front of the CGI mask from Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.  I have always loved this movie and I will still watch it and enjoy it.  It ranks at the Number 4 spot on my Halloween ranking, Behind Rob Zombie's Halloween II, Rob Zombie's Halloween. and the original,  Aside from Michael's mask, there isn't anything I can complain about.  the kills are cool, there is more gore, a good story, great characters, and a good ending.

The special features are: a commentary with Ellie Cornell (Rachael) and Danielle Harris (Jamie Lloyd), a commentary with writer Alan B. McElroy, a Halloween 4/5 Discussion Panel, The Making of Halloween 4: Final Cut, and the Theatrical Trailer.

331400,4,630130053X,"Brief summary of the movie: Michael Myers is alive and the same as for Dr Loomis. Michael goes after his niece Jamie whose mum is Laurie Strode. Laurie is confirmed dead in this movie. He kills anyone who gets in his way. Dr. Loomis is eager to go to Haddonfield and warn the family and cops about Michael being alive.

This movie does have it's plot holes which a lot of true Halloween fans have the right to complain about. Like how does Michael and Dr. Loomis escape an explosion as seen in Halloween 2 (1981) ending. Michael was seen burning too a crisp and the explosion was too big for Dr. Loomis to survive that!!!! Also Michael's both eyes were shot. Yet somehow in this movie he was able to walk around and see - another plot hole!

But?

This movie does have good acting from Donald (R.I.P. Legend). Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris. A decent plot. I specifically enjoyed the trailer boys Earl and his crew that go around shooting in the bushes and killing someone they think is Michael Myers. That scene always gets me laughing. Pure comedy!

This movie has it's pros and cons. But is worth watching and buying. One of the best sequels in the series.",1429833600,,1162,4.466981132075472

331497,4,630130053X,"I just watched 'Halloween 4' for the umpteenth time and I never get tired of it. Being a huge fan of part 1 and 2 I think it fits proudly with the franchise. Director Dwight H. Little does his best to create John Carpenter's atmosphere from the original and honestly, I don't think anyone else at that time (1988) could have done a better job.

Not only the cast is top notch but the script sort of has a welcome back, old-fashioned feel that takes it's time to slowly build up and puts all the key players stranded in a dark gloomy house like so many other classic horror movies. The original Night of the Living Dead is the first one that comes to mind.

Plus, as someone has already mentioned on here, the gore is kept at a minimal which is nice, (unless you crave gore, which I don't) I prefer suspense over too much bloodshed.

Also, I'm absolutely invested in the characters of Jamie and Rachel. Once again thanks to the strong and devoted acting of their players, Danielle Harris and the incredibly spunky Ellie Cornell who really gives good ol' Mikey a run for his money. (I was devastated when Halloween 5 thought it wise to kill her off so early on to make Tina (Wendy Kaplan) an extremely hyper character that was never even mentioned in part 4 it's new star)

The scene that always gets ME hyper and jittery, and loving films even more, is when Rachel and Jamie crawl out of an attic window and start climbing to the rooftop trying to get away from Myers. The sight of little Jamie hanging on to Rachel's back as they desperately struggle upwards with roof tiles giving way underneath them is just beautifully staged and intense.

But the BIG moment in this scene I live for is when Myers pops up on the other side of the roof. and Rachel, with only one thing on her mind, to protect Jamie, quickly wraps a wire around Jamie's waist and tries to lower her down before Myers' approaches.

Ellie Cornell is so focused and strong in this scene you can't help but root for them. ""I'm going to lower you down Jamie."" she tells her looking right into her eyes as Carpenter's creepy score jingles in the background. ""But Rachel!?"" Jamie cries, scared to death. ""I got you!"" promises Rachel as Michael closes in on them ""I got you!"" .....Oops!..... Michael swings his knife at them and all hell breaks loose sending them both over the edge dangling. It's a great moment and, for me, it IS just as exciting as Jamie Lee Curtis' chase scene in part one. I am in love with this scene.

I remember when it first came out, I was so psyched when hearing Michael Myers was returning that I stayed up all night out of sheer anticipation before heading to the mall at 9:00 am to see the first showing. I went back that night with friends to see it again. And all I kept thinking about in between was 'the rooftop' scene.

The finale, with Rachel driving a truck as Michael clings to the roof trying to reach down and grab her is another well staged scene that truly gets the blood pumping, if you let it. It's pretty classy stuff for a fairly low-budget sequel. And there's this really freaky moment when Loomis and the gang are suddenly surrounded by a group of Michael Myers that had me sliding down into my seat saying, 'Holy Crap! Their actually going There! They are going to make Myers truly The Boogeyman and have him go all 'supernatural' . But, that was just a Trick, not a Treat, and I was a little bummed that it didn't go 'beyond'.

There are a few little other things that I still groan at and find a tad distracting. Unfortunately, one of them is pretty significant. Meyers' mask is definitely not super creepy like in part 1 and 2. At times, sadly, he looks too kind and sanitized like Casper the Ghost. And lets face it, that mask is one of the things that made The Boogeyman so frightening. Also, the new Myers' (George Wilbur) doesn't quite have that 'magic walk or body movement' that the original actors (Dick Warlock and Nick Castle, I believe) from 1 and 2 possessed. I don't know about you but watching Myers walking thru the hospital in pt 2 still terrifies me till this day. It is truly nightmarish and Wilbur just doesn't have it.

So, in my opinion, the movie's strength lies more on the atmosphere, pacing and like I've said the acting. One of the things to take note and maybe cut the producers some slack is, I believe, at that time, to create a mask too close to the original would of been perhaps a copyright issue. But at least we have Carpenter's original eerie score which also gives the movie a touch of Carpenterville.  Especially when we first see Michael removed from the asylum and the music starts playing when the ambulance  drives off into the rain. This is a great moment that says 'Awwwh, okay, at least it has a sense of the original and seems to be enjoying what made it so wicked and fun'.

Another thing that is a little distracting and hammy is poor Dr. Loomis, running around pretty much doing the same stuff from the original, warning people of Myers' return, calling him 'Evil' and wearing a pretty shoddy patch of makeup on the side of his face reminding people that he was burned at the end of part two after trying to blow Michael up. But, once again, what else is Loomis supposed to do? He was basically in the original to save the girl and to create a little backstory of why Myers is possibly killing. Not to mention give it a little class thanks to the sincere Donald Pleasance who is always interesting and intense to watch.

Another thing that is oddly interesting is the introduction of a few minor 'teen characters' that the story sets up at the beginning and totally forgets later on. Especially (!!!) the intriguing character of Rachel's friend Lindsey, who drives her and Jamie to the Discount Mart earlier that day. What was up with that? I mean, why tease us with a character who not only has the same name of the little girl who Annie watches in part one, but oddly seems to resemble her with dark hair and cuteness. Logically, I think, she would be too young to be the same character. Or would she? I'm not sure.....

...but then, in Halloween 6, Paul Rudd played a young Tommy Doyle, the boy who Laurie Strode babysat in part one and that didn't really add up. But then, Halloween 6 was working in it's own twisted universe where nothing really mattered, (I mean, Jamie has Michael's baby!!?) so, it's really not fair to compare two completely different worlds.

But, again, why throw this Lindsey character into the mix just to drop her and confuse fans who remember her from the original. It would of been super cool if it WAS Lindsey. I would of embraced it immediately. And in my mind, it is Lindsey. And, it's a shame that the writers of 'Halloween 5' missed the mark and decided to throw in the unknown character of Tina, being that the story was only a year later, when, they could of just made her be Lindsey, a character that was already introduced in pt 4 and was already close to Rachel and Jamie. A better writer would of caught onto that and just had actress Wendy Kaplan play that character. But then again, 'Halloween 5' was doing it's own thing as well thanks to a director who went more 'Friday the 13th' than 'Halloween'

And now, back to how much I love Halloween 4. Especially that rooftop scene with Rachel and Jamie. ""I'm going to lower you down Jamie....""  - Kevin Brian, a devoted fan of slasher movies.",1408924800,,7394,4.4402654867256635
331498,4,630130053X,"This film is a very good sequel in the Halloween franchise for what it is. #1 It's a horror movie sequel made in the 80's so right away expectations are low BUT H4 is really decent. The story is not necessary for the legacy of Michael Myers but if they were gonna make another sequel anyway,this isn't a bad idea. Basically Mike had been defeated at the end of H2,shot & burned. He's been in a coma ever since and then he ""overhears"" doctors mention a surviving family member of his,turns out to be a little girl named Jamie. Of course the doctors mention this right around October 31st and also choose to move comatose Myers to a different facility around Halloween. He wakes up and goes on a rampage as per usual. Heading back to his hometown of Haddonfield where Jamie for some reason...lives.

Donald Pleasance adds serious credibility to this movie with his performance. Really good.

Mike is played very Ghostly by George P Wilbur as he moves silently and creepily thru streets and hallways. Wilbur is considered among the best Myers actors. Blah blah blah highlights include the rooftop scene. So on...just watch the film....the ending isn't such a great idea IMO but whatever. All in all,very good sequel for what it is...",1408665600,2,1230,4.689814814814815

331536,5,630130053X,Halloween 4 is a great sequel and the top third best film in the entire franchise. One of the reasons is the strong cast but most notably Danielle Harris who plays the young niece of Michael Myers. Harris could have only been eight or nine in this film and acting at that age is difficult let alone in a horror film where you have to project many emotions to the audience. Harris does a great job with use of her eyes and different faces to express fear. It's a very exciting movie throughout with a good pace. The supporting cast was superb and you can really go down the line. Ellie Cornell who looks about thirty in this movie does a outstanding job as Rachel who is Danielle's older sister. Danielle was adopted and a great storyline to the movie is her wanted to have a relationship with Rachel that feels like a real sister. Rachel who is by all means a kind hearted girl but is preoccupied with her love life as she forges to start a serious relationship in Sasha Jenson. Jenson plays sort of a tweener character as he is sort of a player but also will protect Danielle and Rachel from Myers. Donald Pleasence is the heat of the film he once again plays the character of Dr. Loomis and just as good as previous outings. In this one he is more determined than every to protect Danielle and the town from harm. Pleasence in the history of horror has to be one of the greatest hero's to come along to fight the unstoppable force in evil. No matter what Dr. Loomis is never afraid of Myers or afraid of being killed to save the town from Myer's path of destruction. Loomis is brave and like Danielle we care deeply for his character who hope he does not meet his demise. Harris does a admirable job filling Jamie Lee Curtis's shoes as Harris went on to have a long career in horror that extends to this day and currently is known as the reigning scream queen. This is one of the best slasher movies of all time and a great horror movie. I recommend this to new horror movie fans. I see this as a must own for any true Halloween fan. This film represents an era of horror that was great it was one of the last great slashers of that era in the 80's. I hope you enjoy the movie and Cheers!,1393804800,5,2190,4.241626794258373

The film felt more intense, Loomis was a lot more active, I felt more for every character, Michael felt menacing (although the mask looks cheap), the kills felt more dramatic and the ending was great. There are some problems however, it's pretty improbuble that Loomis and Michael survived that exploshion, continuity errors are present in quite a dew scenes and the pace still feels a little slow.

Kinda like an anthology of creepy Halloween-themed tales...which to me,would have been an awesome idea. But what do we get instead ? Just another rehash of the same old Michael Myers BS! Ugh! Since most fans of the first two films,absolutley HATED Halloween III,for not having Myers in it,John had to stop their pissing and moaning by bringing Michael back...and what a mistake that was! Just imagine all of the cool Halloween-themed movies we COULD HAVE enjoyed,if it hadn't been for all of the complainers. Halloween 4 is crap all the way through.

331611,4,630130053X,"Every October it's always a joy to give the Halloween series a good rewatch. The original is an absolute horror classic, and forever will be, but sadly the sequels can be a bit mixed overrall. None of them stand out as boring, but the quality of filmmaking dips a bit low in a couple of them. However Halloween 4 stands out as one of the best sequels alongside Halloween II, and makes a more than worthy sequel to the first 2 films.

Halloween 4 centers on Myers making his way back to his hometown of Haddonfield to this time stalk Laurie's daughter and his niece Jaime. Can Loomis and Jaime's foster sister Rachel protect her and stop Michael before it's too late? Or will this be one Halloween everyone will want to forget?
Though Halloween 4 isn't able to top the original classic; it is quite the good film in it's own right. It's easily one of the more suspenseful sequels with a few well done suspense pieces executed perfectly by Dwight H. Little. The rooftop scene towards the end for example is great, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.
Another thing I've always liked about this one is how much more ""Halloween"" this one in particular is. From the creepy opening credits to the very end; the film never forgets what holiday it takes place on. It truly brings the perfect atmosphere the film needed :).
The acting in Halloween 4 is also quite good. Donald Pleasence returns and continues to do his role very well (not to mention he seems like he's slowly losing his mind lol), and both Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris do great jobs as the leads picking up where Jaime Lee Curtis left off. The supporting cast is just as solid with Beau Starr in an underrated performance as Sheriff Meeker, and both Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont) and Brady (Sasha Jenson) make very good supporting characters themselves. Unlike it's sequel Halloween 5, nobody here is really unlikable or annoying, and you really notice the difference when you watch the two films back to back.

Overrall Halloween 4 is one heck of a good sequel. It isn't flawless (Myers mask isn't too good here, nor is the editing during the school scenes towards the end), but it's still very good, and definitly worth adding to your Halloween collection.",1382659200,4,2229,4.626262626262626

331613,5,630130053X,This is without a doubt on of the best horror movies of all time in my personal opinion. I've always loved this movie ever since I was about 8 years old.,1382659200,,153,3.967741935483871
331614,3,630130053X,"Well I guess after the fan outcry from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-III-Season-of-the-Witch/dp/B000ICXQVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween III: Season of the Witch</a>, and it's lack of Michael Myers, the producers decided to cash in on the 80's slasher craze by brining the butcher knife wielding madman back for one more go.

As ""Halloween 4"" begins we learn that Laurie Strode died in a car crash with her husband a couple years after the events of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-II/dp/B0044WQHYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween II</a>. Her daughter, Jamie has been taken in by a foster family, and now has a surrogate older sister named Rachel. It's Halloween and it seems that once again there won't be any parents around, so it falls to Rachel to take Jamie trick or treating.

Meanwhile Michael, badly burned and heavily bandaged after the events from Part 2, is being transferred from the hospital back to a mental asylum. The EMT's making this transfer discuss Laurie's death, and Michael's lone surviving relative, his niece Jamie. At this new Michael pops right up, wipes out the ambulance crew and heads back to Haddonfield. Dr. Loomis is once again warning everyone that Michael is coming back, and after seeing a blood covered ambulance resting on it's roof in a nearby river, Loomis sets out to stop Michael.

Michael begins cutting another bloody swath through Haddonfield, but this time the police believe Loomis, and corral Rachel and Jamie into the sheriff's house. Locking everything down (except the front door apparently) so that Michael can't get in, and no one can get out. It's not long before Jamie and Rachel realize they are locked in with their would-be killer.

""Halloween 4"" does manage to milk a little more tension out of they Michael Myers storyline, and I liked the setting of the sheriff's house and the idea that they are trapped inside with Michael. Danielle Harris does a fantastic job as the new Halloween heroine, and I really like Rachel too. And of course I can always watch Donald Pleasence chew scenery as Dr. Loomis, the unsung hero of this franchise.

With all of that said, this movie doesn't really do anything to differentiate itself from the hundreds of other 80's slashers out there from this time. In fact, ""Halloween 4"" seems to be imitating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0095D42RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>, or any one of the films that originally began as an imitation of ""Halloween"". There is really very little gas left in the tank of the franchise at this point, and that becomes painfully obvious over the next two films. And viewer be warned, if you start with this one, you are cursing yourself by having to watch 5 & 6...two painfully stupid films.

I say give this one a view if you want to see Danielle Harris acting her heart out as a little kid, and as a farewell to Donald Pleasence (who died shortly before part 6 hit theaters), and then skip right to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-H20-HD/dp/B009K52HN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween H20 [HD</a>], otherwise just watch 1, 2, H20 & Resurrection and you'll get a complete little saga.",1382659200,,3367,5.657425742574257

 Four begins well enough. At a pretty depressing institution, Michael learns of the existence of his niece in the ambulance. If those two hadn't spoken, imagine what trouble could have been saved! At any rate, he quickly dispenses of his escorts and ventures on to his hometown.

 Wrapped in bandages (creepy as hell), the scene between him and Loomis, and the gas station sequence rocked. I was all ready for another thrilling adventure with Myers as the guide.

 The acting from newbies Ellie Cornell and Danielle Lewis aren't poor but not superb either. Danielle as little Jamie Lloyd was well cast but movies centering too much on screaming children grate on my nerves. Loomis is the same, dramatic but very watchable. The rest are there as easy kills.

 By now the Halloween franchise has unfortunitely turned more mainstream in a way that slices to the bone. Plenty of teens running around but at least it's not as damp as the next addition. At least Myers stays somewhat on track by going after Jamie and simply slaying those that get in his way.

 One dislike I had about the film was Jamie seeing Myers when she really wasn't through hallucinations. First of all, we have seen the villain so many times before any real action begins that it's nearly tiresome when the real thing DOES show. For Jamie to have such a clear image in her head of Myers, she must have seen some sort of pictures of the man -- which doesn't make too much sense either. Her psychological status brushed aside, too much Mikey upfront makes me yawn.

 Another catch in the movie was the melodrama. I hate that! Namely when the new guardians run out of their room when little Jamie is experiencing a rather violent nightmare. Do we really need slow-motion for all of this??

 For Myers himself, he's just not as scary looking as the first two. They chose a shorter and stalkier actor to play the masked fiend, and this abrupt change wasn't welcomed by me. His face is rounder and is it just me, or are his nostrils HUGE??

 The kills were more modernized. A neck ripped open to the point of near decapitation was certainly violent, and the effects were well done. At least some gore decorated the halls this sequel.

 Carpenter's score is there at times but some of the music has been altered, and I'm not sure yet what to think on that. The movie was dark and mainly set at night but nothing too artsy.

 Overall, a movie for hardcore Halloween fans or those who don't mind a stalker movie that doesn't offers much more than some semi-creative killings.",1379635200,,2717,4.562886597938144

331662,4,630130053X,"This was the movie that brought Michael Myers back.  Ten years after the original (and after an attempt to make a Halloween movie without him) they bring him back to attempt to kill his niece (the daughter of Laurie Strode who was killed off in this version).  What follows was the standard fare of Michael going through the town killing anyone who got in his way.  Donald Pleasance comes back to play Dr. Loomis, and managed to keep the same intensity from the original two films.  I don't necessarily think that there was a big need to make this film.  I think a fine ending to the series would have been to have Myers and Loomis killed at the end of Halloween 2.  But, if they were going to bring him back, this was as good a story as there could have been to do so (since Jamie Lee Curtis did not return for this one).  It was before the franchise got overly stupid (as would happen in Halloween 6 and 8 and even to some extent in 5).

Ultimately if you liked the original Halloween and Halloween 2, while this is not as good as either of those, it does hold its own.

There is no Jamie Lee Curtis in the film, but still found it good without her, until the next film in the series which wasn't good and needed Curtis badly in it.

331666,4,630130053X,"Michael Myers is back, having been called home to Haddonfield when he discovers that his niece Jamie has escaped his bloody rampage. It is up to Dr. Loomis to stop the mindless murderer once and for all! HALLOWEEN 4 marks the return of Michael Myers after a seven year hiatus following the events in HALLOWEEN 2. With the Slasher genre already on the wane by 1988, the delayed attempt to cash-in on the series surprisingly proves to be amongst the very best when it comes to Slasher sequels. Dwight H. Little makes several ambitious attempts with the camera in addition to his many big action sequences. Michael's rooftop assault on Jamie and Rachel marks one of the most thrilling scenes in the Slasher genre. Composer Alan Howarth breathes new life into John Carpenter's original score, with an increase in tempo that heightens the heart-racing suspense. The majority of HALLOWEEN 4's success, however, lies in the hands of young Danielle Harris in her breakthrough role as Jamie Lloyd. Her sweet sincerity and innocent charm are only matched by her ability to express sheer terror as she eludes her murderous uncle on screen. The great Donald Pleasence returns to the role of Dr. Loomis as well, with all of the same mannerisms and lengthy monologues that he is best known for from the first two films. Just when it seems that Michael has been defeated and that everything is safe in the end, we are given one final shock that rivals Michael's disappearance in the original HALLOWEEN!

Halloween 2, as wonderful a film as it is, is just a direct continuation of the first and doesn't really act as a sequel. In that respect, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers operates as the greatest sequel in the Halloween franchise. The opening sequences evoke the mood and spirit of the John Carpenter masterpiece as well as evoking a sense of Fall or that special feeling you get around that time of year that is Halloween. More importantly, this film furthers the story of Michael Myers.

Operating on the assumption that the third film in the franchise (Halloween 3: Season of the Witch) never existed, this installment picks up 10 years after the original, with Michael in a coma and moved to a new institution. During a transfer, Michael awakes and escapes, leaving a bloody trail all the way to Haddonfield. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, physically scarred from his previous battle with Michael at the end of Halloween 2 and carrying with him the baggage that is the legacy of Michael Myers. Also introduced is the little 10 year old orphan daughter of Laurie Strode (who is now dead), Jamie (played by Danielle Harris). Directed by Dwight Little, this film operates much as the original film did with suspense and uncertainty driving the scares.

I only had basic cable as a kid, and Halloween 4 & 5 never aired on any of the channels. The first thing I noticed was the horrible cheap looking mask. You would think Moustapha Akkad would want a decent looking mask, but I guess they ran out of money for it. All the VHS covers and DVD covers have Michael wearing the 1978 mask, so it can be a little misleading.

After the box-office bomb called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-III-Season-of-the-Witch/dp/B0089N4GDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween III: Season of the Witch</a>, the franchise took a six year break, coming back in 1988 with Michael Myers surviving the explosion at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-II/dp/B0089BSOPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween II</a>. For the past ten years, he has been in a coma at a sanitarium. Without Dr. Loomis's approval, Michael is being transferred to another hospital by an ambulance. He awakes from the coma and kills the paramedics.

Dr. Loomis arrives at the crime scene on Halloween morning. After a quick glance he knew that Michael is alive. On his way to Haddonfield, Illinois, he stops by a gas station/diner where he finds two corpses and Michael, now dressed  in a mechanic's clothes. Dr. Loomis pulls out his gun, but it is too late as Michael has escaped in a tow-truck, causing a fire that explodes Loomis's car and the gas station/diner.

Eight-year-old Jamie Lloyd is still grieving over the death of her parents, whom died in a car accident. She continues to live in Haddonfield with her foster family, the Carruthers. On Halloween night, Jamie's foster parents are spending the night out and Jamie's foster-sister Rachel is going to take her (dressed in a clown costume) trick-or-treating for the night, even though Rachel is going to miss her date with her boyfriend. The girls are unaware that they are being watched by the bogeyman!

After getting a ride from a stranger, Dr. Looms enlists the help of Sheriff Meeker and his deputies. They locate Rachel and Jamie and barricade them inside the sheriff's house, where Rachel's boyfriend, Brady, happens to be with the sheriff's daughter. Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Meeker leave the house to search the streets for Michael unaware that he is already in the house. One by one, Michael kills everyone in his path until it is just Rachel and Jamie defending for their lives.

Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is one my favorite sequels from the franchise. Yes, the acting isn't great and the mask is horrible, but I'm a sucker for any movie that is set on Halloween. I didn't mind that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't appear in the film, but instead the film focuses on Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris) who becomes Michael's obsession and only bloodline. Once again, Donald Pleasence reprises his role as Dr. Samuel Loomis, but the character is older and a little crazier as he is determined to stop Michael's madness. Even thought I have seen the movie dozens of times, I still love the twist at the ending.

I bought the VHS tape in the late 90s and replaced it back in 2006 with this DVD. There are many extras - Audio Commentary with actresses Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris, Audio Commentary with Writer Alan B.

I am not bothered as much as most regarding the deleted scenes, if there not there there not there.  I am more disapointted in the PQ and Audio upgrade.  there is a slight upgrade in the clarity of the picture, but there are still many scenes which don't look much better than the first DVD.  I should've keeped my Divi max DVD's.  I sold them and only got 1.50 each.  As to the audio, I was expecting alot mor LFE and suround sound from the gas station scene.  When Lomis falls into the pile of stuff you don't hear any dramadics.  there was no dynamic to the explosion.  Anchor Bay just ported over some previous features.  No thought was put into the special features.  How about some addtional docs, how about current innerviews with the cast.  Atleast port over all bonus features from the other edtions so if you sell your other DVD's you still have all your bonus features from the previous editions.  I cannot stand TrueHD (beside MI 4), a DTS-HD audio would've been alot better.  I am just tired of shelling out money for what is suppose to be an upgrade.  Which turns out to be a cash grab.  PQ:5 out of 10 Audio:4 1/2 out of 10.  I guess we will have to wait for another Annv. Edition.  The studios should let the fans vote on things, since they will shell out there money, maybe if a Bluray gets fan votes and ideas, they might make more fans happier.  Anchor bay should take note to Universals recnet restoration of Jaws.  I know H4 is not Jaws, but atleast they will understand the direction they went with the restoration and remastering.  H4 woiuld not even need as much due to the films different age.  Thank goodness H2 and H3 was done right by Shout Factory..I recomend you keep your older edtions of H4 and H5 if you still have them.

331727,1,630130053X,"First, let me say that Halloween 4 is a great film, so this review isn't for the film itself.  This poor review is for the way this particular release was handled by Anchor Bay.  The fact that Anchor Bay had no problems telling us that the 30 minutes of missing footage was going to be added as a bonus feature and then telling us that wouldn't be the case right before the Blu Ray was scheduled to be released is not the right way to get your product into the consumers hands.  What is even worse is that Anchor Bay has not released a statement as to why this footage was not added to the release. For those of you who are under the impression that all the scenes shot have been released and that no other footage exists, I distinctly remember a scene where Rachel tells Kelly to ""have some coffee"" and then proceeds to pour the hot coffee down Kelly's ""Cops Do It By The Book"" shirt. In the theatre, Kelly goes down to the laundry room and changes her shirt. This is why, in the DVD releases Kelly has her cop shirt on when the coffee gets poured on her and then the next scene she is wearing the flannel shirt when she takes the tray out to the living room and finds Deputy Logan dead. This is just one example of footage that was shot that has not been included in any release to date.  Shame on you Anchor Bay- you can certainly do better than this and us loyal Halloween fans deserve better!!",1345852800,7,1398,4.205223880597015

331729,4,630130053X,"John Carpenter didn't know what he was unleashing in 1978 when his independent slasher ""Halloween"" hit theaters. It was a runaway sensation which spawned hundreds of imitators and continues to even now. Whenever a movie is financially successful, you can bet on it studios are going to demand a sequel. ""Halloween II"" followed the original in 1981 without Carpenter's direction. It picked up exactly where the first one left off.

An attempt to take the ""Halloween"" franchise into a different direction without the help of serial killer Michael Myers chopping away at victims failed in a third movie. The decision was made to re-instate the successful formula of the first two films with the next installment, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers."" Anchor Bay released a new Blu-ray version of the 1988 movie and it looks marvelous.

It's the 10th anniversary of the Halloween night massacre in Haddonfield, Illinois. Michael Myers escapes from an ambulance while being transferred to another mental facility. He makes his way to the small town obsessed with finding and killing his nine-year-old niece. Dr. Loomis is hot on his bloody trail and must protect the girl and her new family from the knife-wielding maniac.

""Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a competent follow-up to the second film. It contains everything fans of the original could want with the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis. The movie takes viewers back to the familiar location of Haddonfield 10 years later. It shows us how the town has dealt with the many deaths of their family members a decade before. There's also a direct tie to the first two films because the character of Jamie is the daughter of Laurie Strode. We see the return of Dr. Loomis and gain some insight into what happened to him after the hospital fire in ""Halloween II.""

It's interesting to note that there are very few actual scenes of stabbing or hacking. Director Dwight H. Little chose to go for a ""less-is-more"" approach and cuts away from direct scenes of penetrating carnage. It gives the film a bit of a Hitchcockian atmosphere. You can tell Little wanted to focus more on the suspense and less on the graphic violence. However, there's still plenty of blood and gore to thrill horror enthusiasts.

Actor Danielle Harris is perfect as the character of Michael Myers' nine-year-old niece, Jamie. She moves back and forth through emotions quite effectively and is convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance pours his heart and soul into his portrayal of Dr. Loomis for a third time. It's excellent to see a veteran actor of his caliber take a part in what most would call a simple slasher film and treat it with such a high level of sincerity.

The high-definition transfer looks and sounds excellent. The picture maintains its original feel but is clear and precise at the same time. The audio delivers all the slashing, screams, and pulsating music your nerves can take thanks to a 5.1 surround mix.

Special features for this edition include two separate audio commentaries with actors Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris and director Dwight H. Little and author Justin Beahm. The ""'Halloween 4 / 5' Discussion Panel"" from the 25th Anniversary celebration is also here. It contains a theatrical trailer as well.

Fans of the franchise who are always looking for the latest and greatest versions of these films will want to run out and buy the new ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" Blu-ray from Anchor Bay.

331741,1,630130053X,"It's been mentioned here before, but, I think it's an important point. Anchor Bay is releasing these Halloween blu-rays at new release prices, but porting old features from DVDs that you can pick up for a couple dollars. Basically you are only paying for new picture transfer and remastered audio. The DVD releases of Halloween 4 and 5 have HD transfers that up-convert just fine on a standard blu-ray player, which makes these releases a completely pointless ploy for money. HALLOWEEN fans have been taken advantage of for years with multiple releases. The icing on the cake was the promise of NEW special features, including 30 minutes of deleted scenes, which have not been seen in over twenty years. As a life-long fan of the series, I was HIGHLY disappointed that they released a statement TWO WEEKS before the release stating that the deleted scenes AND new writer's commentary were NOT on the disc. The kicker is, Anchor Bay only admitted to this AFTER reviewers called them out after recieving a screener copy. Basically, this company lied in order to entice pre-orders. Why would anyone pay top dollar for a new picture transfer, when the DVD releases are perfectly fine? Also, reviews are calling the upscaled picture and sound merely ""adequate"" not spectacular, which is what these prices reflect. In a year or so, they will most likely release a ""special edition"" with the features they promised for this release, in order to take even MORE money from HALLOWEEN fans. Save yourself the money and pick up the dvds at bargain prices, and wait until they launch a REAL release of these films on Blu-ray.

But do we finally get to see this?

Nope.  So we basically get one new commentary and some recycled footage from the Halloween: 25 Years of Terror DVD.

I miss the old Anchor Bay.  the company that basically put their heart and soul into special features when other companies were all strictly bare bones.

331743,3,630130053X,"The ""Halloween"" films have a very funny and checkered History.  The first 2 Films formed a huge fan base and loyal following however ""Halloween 3"" departed from the Michael Myers Story.  While many people think ""Halloween 3"" was a box office bomb the fact is it did make money! If you adjusted its gross to today's average ticket price the film would out gross the most of the sequels that have followed it.

Now in 1988 ""Halloween"" fans rejoiced when after a 7 years absence Michael Myers returned to the silver screen and to major success!  I for one loved this entry into the series and the film did deliver the scares and a believable story.

In this film Michael once again is out to kill.  He Returns to Haddenfield and is out to kill his niece. Dr Sam Loomis is also once again out to stop Michael.  While not groundbreaking it is a worth while sequel.  It is the best sequel that doesn't have Jamie Lee Curtis.  Daniel Harris was a terrific casting choice.  She would later go on to be cast in the hit tv-show  ""Roseanne"".

Now I have bought the DVD and it has s a great picture and sound.  When Anchor Bay announced the Blu-Ray was coming out with 30 minutes of alternate and deleted footage fans were very eager to buy the blu-ray.  Now 2 weeks before the blu-ray Anchor Bay Quietly released a statement that those scenes ""Are No Longer Included"" on the new release.  Well without those extras the blu-ray release has nothing new to offer to fans.  A new picture transfer and new commentary is not worth the price.  What can the director say about this film that he didn't say before on his previous commentary?

Also if you have a blu-ray player it will upload your dvd just fine and the picture will be great.

I suggest if you don't already own ""Halloween 4"" and you want to buy it then buy the standard DVD.  The Blu-ray isn't worth the upgrade.",1344643200,7,1859,4.411764705882353

331745,3,630130053X,"HALLOWEEN IV: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS pertains to the most ghoulish mass murderer of all times Michael Myers(George Wilbur)returning to his hometown(Haddonfield)to kill his orphaned niece Jamie Lloyd(Danielle Harris), the daughter of Michael's kid-sister Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis), with Michael's overzealous psychatrist Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance)back on his trail again attempting to dissuade Michael from reliving his killing-spree and ordeal he caused 10 years ago.

As the title indicates, HALLOWEEN 4 marks the return of Michael Myers as the central villain from both John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN which theatrical release was in the Fall of 1978 and HALLOWEEN 2 which was released in the Fall of 1981, due to Michael Myers absence in HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH which was released in the Fall of 1982 since John Carpenter & his co-producer(Debra Hill)had retired the Myers character plot outline after HALLOWEEN II by intending to feature a new Halloween-Season related plot every sequel of which HALLOWEEN III would be the first since Carpenter & Hill only agreed to take part in the making of HALLOWEEN 3 if it was unrelated to HALLOWEEN I and 2.

However, since HALLOWEEN III was death at the box office back in the Autumn of 1982; when the producers finally made a 4th sequel 6 years later in the Autumn of 1988, HALLOWEEN IV reintroduced a Michael Myers-related plot for a decade later when Michael Myers finally awakens out of a 10-year coma and escapes during a transfer back to the Smiths Grove Sanitarium on Halloween Eve of 1988 where Michael had escaped from on Halloween Eve of 1978 and discovers that Laurie is supposedly dead from a car-accident & now has a daughter since Jamie Lee Curtis(Laurie)didn't want to continue her participation in the film, but had later returned to reprise her role in HALLOWEEN H20 in the Summer of 1998 which reveals to us that Laurie had faked her death & had moved far away from the Midwest to start a new life in a fictional Northern California town called Summer Glenn.

So in the Fall of 1988; Michael Myers goes back to the fictional rural Haddonfield, Illinois to try killing Jamie instead while the now fire-scarred Dr. Loomis who survived the fiery hospital explosion with Michael on Halloween night of 1978 at the end of HALLOWEEN 2 pursues Michael again after discovering he has escaped again for the second time around.

Meanwhile, on Halloween night of 1988; Jamie discovers that Michael Myers is her uncle whom is the same bogeyman whom she's been having nightmares about & almost gets attacked at a drug store and that he's out to get her and her teenage foster sister Rachel Carruthers(Ellie Cornell)while Dr. Loomis arrives in the remote midwestern town and joins forces with the new Haddonfield Sheriff Ben Meeker(Beau Starr)after discovering that the former Sheriff Brackett(Charles Cyphers)has retired while Michael single-handedly takes down the entire Haddonfield Police station and slaughters the Sheriff's entire police force after Michael shorts out an entire power-plant plunging the entire town into darkness under siege.

So in the absence of the Sheriff Meeker's police force, Loomis improvises by forming a lynch mob full of beer-bellies to hunt down Myers with very little luck to go around.

Additionally; when HALLOWEEN 4 began filming in the Spring of 1988, instead of being filmed in Pasadena, California where HALLOWEEN I filming location and stand in took place, director(Dwight Little)had decided to film HALLOWEEN IV in Salt Lake City, Utah instead & the producers were forced to import leaves & big squash which they'd use to create pumpkins by painting them orange in order to make it look like the Autumn season which was also done in the original HALLOWEEN during its filming in the Spring of 1978, especially since Little was trying to capture the mood of the original HALLOWEEN and yet take a lot of new chances.

In addition to that; even though HALLOWEEN 4 supposedly took place in Haddonfield, I noticed that the town of Haddonfield was bigger and a lot more alive than it was in HALLOWEEN I where Haddonfield was even smaller and a lot quieter and an even more dull and remote area than it was in this sequel which is probably due to the change in where the filming of the movies took place at.

HALLOWEEN 4 was also the 5th best installments of the HALLOWEEN saga and when HALLOWEEN IV opened in 1,679 theatres on Friday October 21, 1988; it grossed $6,831,250 in its opening weekend achieving a total domestic gross of $17,768, 757 back in the Fall of 1988 preceeding the theatrical release of HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1989.

One thing that I cant help finding baffling is why did the producers use Michael Myers mask from the original HALLOWEEN for the front cover instead of using the mask that Myers used in this 4th installment of the HALLOWEEN saga which was a more self-made more sophisticated Halloween mask that was more ghoulish and ghostly looking rather than the spray painted STAR TREK Capt. Kirk mask they used for the original since John Carpenter couldn't afford to make a mask of their own at the time since HALLOWEEN was made a low budget back in 1978.",1341792000,3,5225,4.921679909194098
331746,5,630130053X,"Let's be honest here, no matter what horror franchise, the original is, and always will be, the best of the series. There are no ifs ands or buts about it. Yet every once in a while there comes a sequel that is actually worth the money that's spent on it by the company and the public.

For the ""Halloween"" franchise, that sequel was ""Halloween 4"".

The execs. in charge of the franchise made a hug mistake in ""Halloween 3,"" making it completely independent of the tale of Michael Myers. This film, however, reunites viewers with their beloved blank-faced, sociopathic trick-or-treater they all know and love in a huge way.

Following the events of ""Halloween II,"" Michael Myers is in a coma, severely burnt from his most recent battle with his former doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). While being transferred to another hospital, Michael escapes to hunt down his niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) and once again bring terror to the town of Haddonfield.

Honestly, this movie is impeccably made. This is the only sequel that addresses how Michael got another mask. This is also the only sequel that actually instills the feeling of autumn from the very first couple of frames.

The story is not too over done (as it is in the sixth installment) and the plot line is pretty solid for being about a serial killer stalking a little girl. The acting is amazing on all counts. Harris is, believably, one of the greatest child horror movie actors I've ever seen. This makes all preconceived notions about the film fly out the window and lets the audience create their own experience.

When I was younger, Halloween H20 was my favorite installment in the series, but now that I am older I can see the flaws in that film. It was quite the opposite with this movie, where I grew to appreciate it more and more as time went by.

A great movie by itself but an amazing chapter in the mythos of Michael Myers.",1338940800,2,1897,4.6447761194029855
331747,5,630130053X,"Taking place 10 years after Halloween II, Myers and Loomis are revealed to have survived the events of II. Myers & Loomis were burned. Myers has been in a coma since then. I did like Michael's mask here. There are freakishly scary moments in the film, but some cool ones too.

Some of my favorite scenes:

- Myers & Loomis - Gas Station scene. Awesome scene that really picks up when Loomis sees and talks to Myers.

- Myers getting his mask from the costume store where Jamie was getting hers. It's just a hand grabbing the Myers mask. That's what's cool about it IMO.

- Myers stalking Rachel while she looks for Jamie, who got lost while trick or treating.

- The construction worker's death.

- Brady's death. I liked him. And I give him credit for being brave enough to tell Rachel to, ""Get up there."" while he took on Myers by himself. He did his best to no avail. I don;t like that Brady died. It was how Michael survived his attacks & the way he killed him that I liked. Instead of waiting for him to walk up the stairs, he should have went with Rachael & Jamie because even if he did end up dying, he would've survived longer at least. Maybe enough to help them get off the roof and running away. Wish he didn't die though. That's the problem with horror films. Usually at some point or another, the cool people die.

- Deaths of the drunk people who try to get Rachel & Jamie to safety.

- Rachel running down Michael with the truck. He just stood there still and took it. So badass!

- Michael being shot by the cops multiple times before finally falling through a mine shaft. It took countless shots from all the cops who were there for him to finally fall.

Scary moments (I liked them):
- At night, in the house, Myers sits up. She cries & her parents find her in the closet telling her it was just a dream.

- Jamie touching Myers, who grabs his knife. As he gets up, she gets down before the cops shoot him.

- When the Sheriff's daughter brings tea for Deputy Logan, she sees that he's dead and Michael, who was in the one in the chair in the exact position as Logan was, quickly gets up, turns around and kills her. Wicked death.

- The scariest one to me. When the Sheriff and Loomis rescue Jamie & Rachel, you see the camera moving away fro mthe real Myers who just stands there still looking on.

Right now, I think this sequel is the best. But my answer always changes when I get asked which sequel I liked best lol.",1330819200,12,2438,4.237580993520519

331749,4,630130053X,"Dwight H. Little (Director of ""Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (2004)"") brings us what audiences around the world wanted back for 6 years!

Plot: On that dark Halloween night ten years ago, he murdered fourteen (not counting the accidental death in Halloween 2 or the paramedic because in my book he lives according to the TV version) people! Now he has come out of his so called comma that he has been in for those 10 long years and he is looking for Laurie Strode's daughter ""Jamie"" whom is still a little girl and fears what boogeyman's live in her closet! Can Dr. Loomis and her Older Step Sister ""Rachel"" save her!?

Review: With its $5 million budget, Dwight H. Little, Danny Lipsius and Larry Rattner reinvent the night that startled everyone back in '78 and '81 by creating dark atmospheric scenes, great special effects, and suspenseful scenes that will have you bending forward in your seat from the utter thrill that this movie creates! This is by far the greatest Halloween sequel next to Part 2 & 7! It has relentless terror, some good special effects, and a merciless killer! Michael is back and more bad-ass than ever before! I do however wish they did something more with a lot of the deaths such as when Michael attacks the truck load of people all he does is throw them off... I think there might have been a very dry stabbing but that's just from what I can remember.... One other thing I didn't like about that scene was the fact that when the people get killed behind the next potential victim, the person in front doesn't even notice... I think it would've been better if they did two important things.... add gore to the scene and have them all try to fight Michael Myers! Other than some concerns I had that really weren't that important the film was excellent and it showed a side of Michael we never got to see until this Sequel!

Acting: It had its ups and downs in this department. The acting could've been a whole lot better and dare I say it... but in my opinion Danielle Harris could've done a hell of a lot better! But she is a much better actor now than she was in the 80's again that is my opinion. And uh... oh yeah... Donald Pleasance stole the show yet again but he did seem a bit more crazy than usual in this installment!

Gore: a ripped throat, some violent crushed heads, an impalement involving a shotgun (Nice!!), some bloody corpses (including a dog), some stabbings and little more...I hate to say it but I do believe it could've been gorier... some of the kills were just super weak and uncreative!

Bottom Line: Terror is reborn in the sequel that redefines Michael's actions and creates a true monster that is vicious and dark! This is Mostly for die hard Michael Myers/Halloween fans though!

1988 / 88 min. / Rated R.

After the critical failure of Halloween III, it would take six years before we'd see another installment. A lot had changed in the horror genre during that time. We had four Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street films. We saw Leatherface, Pinhead, The Tall Man and Chucky either back on the silver screen or witnessing them for the very first time. Now, after a seven year hiatus, Michael Myers was about to make his return, and expectations were high.

The big question was; how do you move forward with franchise? John Carpenter and Debra Hill were fully invested in a Dennis Etchison script that would have had the town of Haddonfield inadvertently resurrecting the spirit of Michael Myers by suppressing the memory of him. Moustapha Akkad disagreed with this pitch and felt that after the ill-conceived third film that the best direction for the franchise to go was back to the basics, and physically bring Michael Myers back. After legal issues ensued, Carpenter and Hill sold their stakes in the Halloween franchise, and Akaad had full control to do what he felt was best.

Due to a potential writer's strike, Alan B. McElroy - who would later go on to write Wrong Turn - was hired to pen the script with only 11 days to do so. Dwight H. Little would be brought on to direct, and with the exception of the returning Donald Pleasence, the film was all surrounded by newcomers to the series. The cast would include Ellie Cornell, Danielle Harris, George P. Wilbur, Sasha Jenson, Kathleen Kinmont, Beau Starr and Michael Pataki. The plot would center on Michael Myers awakening from a coma after 10 years to return to Haddonfield to stalk his niece Jamie, the daughter of Laurie Strode - who apparently died in a car accident 11 months earlier. Dr. Loomis, who also happened to somehow survive the fiery conclusion in part II, is again on Myers' tail, this time with the help of Sheriff Ben Meeker.

Unlike its predecessors, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers would not be shot in California, and instead principal photography took place in Salt Lake City, Utah with a reported budget of $5 million. The film's production was hampered by the use of a variety of Myers' mask, and you can blatantly notice one such moment during the film. Halloween 4 would also have to undergo some reshoots to incorporate some gore effects for the film. John Carll Buechler (director of Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood) was the man responsible for the overseeing of these effects. On October 21st 1988, the film hit theaters nationwide and would enjoy two weeks at the #1 spot. It garnered borderline positive reviews, and it successfully rejuvenated the fan base again. It earned nearly $18 million at the box office - which would inflate to over $31 million dollars to todays ticket prices - and was an even bigger hit on video.

For me, Halloween 4 is somewhat of a mixed bag. There's plenty that's right about the movie - Donald Pleasence being the most notable. If for nothing else, he really is a lot of fun to watch in these movies. Danielle Harris - who plays Jamie - also did a fine job. The other highlights of the film include the set-up - there's some good atmosphere at play there - and I do enjoy the climax. The surprise ending is also pretty cool - Pleasence really sells it, and makes it work. The movie does, however, stumble with its characters. The love triangle between the three teenagers is not all that interesting, and there is no real humor or quirkiness to alleviate the serious tone of the film. And while I think Alan Howarth did a nice job with scoring the film, I did miss the original music, and I think it could have benefitted the film greatly had they fully used it.  As for the film's newest Shape, George P. Wilbur did an adequate enough job in the role. I am not too keen of his actual - um - shape, but from my understanding, he wore some sort of padding underneath the jumpsuit to make him appear bigger. I would have preferred otherwise.

Nitpicking aside, I think the biggest complaint anyone can really throw its way is that it's often guilty of just being average. However, being average is a huge mark-up from the abysmal Halloween III. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good horror flick. There are elements that could have been fine-tuned, but predominately, it's still an entertaining enough watch.",1317427200,2,4421,4.6313775510204085
331761,3,630130053X,"All in all, this wasn't bad a movie. The storyline is a very simple and straight forward. The Shape returns to Haddonfield, when he learns that he has a niece.

331763,4,630130053X,"Halloween 4 - The Return Of Michael Myers (1988) supposedly revived the Halloween franchise after fans rejected Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982).  Michael Myers was brought back after he burned to death in Halloween II (1981).  When he burned to death, it was meant to be the end of Michael Myers appearing in any upcoming Halloween movies that John Carpenter and Debra Hill made.  They retired the Michael Myers character after Halloween II and decided to go in the direction of making a new Halloween-themed movie with a different story every year.  Halloween III was the first movie in this new direction.  Though I love the movie, it bombed.  So Moustapha Akkad decided he wanted to bring back Michael Myers.  This is when things started to get very questionable, out of hand, and was the beginning of the now invincible killer (and somewhat boring) Michael Myers.

When I think about Halloween the holiday, I think of a wide variety of things - ghosts, monsters, haunted houses, haunted carnivals, haunted insane asylums, haunted castles, vampires, zombies, werewolves, graveyards, and on and on and on.  But when I think about the Halloween movie franchise, I think of only one thing - a serial killer named Michael Myers.  Carpenter and Hill were on the right track when they came out with Halloween III - Season Of The Witch.  The reason is because it was a different Halloween movie with a different storyline.  They gave us Michael Myers for two movies (Halloween and Halloween II), but then it was time for a change.  See what I mean?  Halloween the holiday is about variety, not doing the same thing over and over.  To have a serial killer in one Halloween-themed movie was fine, even two movies was fine.  But it was time to explore other aspects of Halloween.  Halloween III touched on the origins of Halloween in ancient Ireland and featured a modern day warlock who manufactured Halloween masks that could kill the children who wore them when they watched a commercial on TV on Halloween night at 9 PM.  Sure, the movie wasn't well received, but it was something different.  But a lot of fans still wanted to see Michael Myers over and over again.  Why, I'll never know.  So we got Halloween 4 - The Return Of Michael Myers.

I'll review this movie for what it is.  It's a good movie.  The big star of this movie is Danielle Harris, who plays Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of the deceased Laurie Strode.  Michael Myers is after her, trying to kill her.  The action is good, the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the atmosphere is dark and shadowy, which is good.  I don't care for the mask that Michael Myers is wearing.  It's not nearly as scary looking as the mask from the first two movies.  Plus, Myers himself seems to have put on weight in the ten years that went by from October 31, 1978 to October 31, 1988.  The movie's Halloween atmosphere is better than it is in the first two movies from 1978 and 1981.  More leaves, more Halloween decorations, just better all around.  The movie has quite a few predictable moments, a lot of them being things we've all seen in movies a hundred times before.  You'll see what I mean.  The methods of killing that Myers uses are different from the first two movies.  His methods are more violent and bloody.  The ending of the movie is bizarre.

This DVD is presented in widescreen, enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  It features audio commentary by Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris and also writer Alan B. McElroy.  It also has a Halloween 4 & 5 discussion panel, a documentary called The Making of Halloween 4: Final Cut, and the theatrical trailer.

I seem to be in the minority, but I didn't care for Halloween II (the original or Rob Zombie version). Losing Carpenter's directing style, it just felt like a generic slasher, but Halloween 4 really was a great new direction for the series.

Rachel and Jamie are a great leading duo and of course Donald Plesance is fantastic as Dr. Loomis. Standout scenes include Dr. Loomis confronting Michael at the gas station and the rooftop escape.

What I wasn't prepared for was the emotional impact of the ending. The reaction Dr. Loomis gives to the startling revelation was gut wrenching and the final image very disturbing without any type of gore whatsoever.

I wasn't a fan of the stuntmen playing Michael (one seemed to be hunching or have no neck at one point), but luckily the director kept The Shape in the shadows where he belongs for the most part.

After watching the original I would recommend this installment as a solid follow up.

I should also mention that the audio commentaries, one with the 2 main actresses and the other with the writer and a moderator are very lively and informative.

Myers has been kept in a federal sanitarium but now he is being transfered back to his old stomping grounds, Smith's Grove. There is no logic, no reason behind this move which in Sid's eyes is great because it's so implausible that it set off the first B alarm of the film. During the transfer, the ambulance crew is discussing the comatose guy in the back and they mention that his sister, Laurie Strode, has died in a car accident and Laurie's daughter, Jamie please, is living with the Carruthers family in Haddonfield. Obviously, Myers wakes up upon hearing this, picks them off and heads to Haddonfield for a Halloween rampage. Standing in his way, however, is the legendary Dr. Sam Loomis along with new sherrif in town Ben Meeker. For this round, Loomis has some of the best fake burn scars ever, but he's still equiped with all his old speeches about Myers to convey that he's not a man, he's pure evil. Awesome.

Sid did the math here and figured out that Myers is 31 here, right in the heart of his prime. That must account for his possesing little girls to choose his clown costume from his rookie year and ice a family member and appear randomly to Jamie and Loomis. He was a tour de force in this one. He hit his peak, undoubedly, in the famous Hick Scene which just may be the best scene in horror film history and looms large in Sid the Elf lore. If you're a B fan, please get the DVD of this movie and watch the Hick scene in slo mo. If you don't crack up at least 5 times, well, Sid wouldn't believe you.",1256860800,,2237,4.349282296650718

331788,4,630130053X,"The first film, John Carpenter's Halloween, is a classic horror film that inspired a decade of masked murderers stalking teen girls on holidays. Its sequel, Halloween II, upped the ante with more blood and more disposable characters. Halloween III: Season of the Witch tried turning the franchise into The Twilight Zone. But after its critical and commercial failure, it was realized that the the real draw to these movies was the borderline-supernatural masked killer Michael Myers.

Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was the producers' ""mia culpa"" to those who were turned off by Halloween III, resurrecting Myers and making him even more unkillable, if that's possible. He seems to now posess superhuman strength on top of the supernatural ability to take any kind of physical punishment but never die, embedding his thumb in one man's forehead and crushing another man's skull with his bare hands. Looks like Michael has had in I.V. drip of roids while he was in that decade-long coma.

Also making his return to the franchise is Donald Pleasence's Sam Loomis, Michael's former psychiatrist and the Captain Ahab to Michael's Moby Dick. Though scarred and hobbled but somehow still alive after Halloween II's explosive finale, Loomis is still as relentless in hunting Michael as Michael is hunting his family, and Pleasence's perfomance anchors the movie, as Loomis once again tries to warn the quaint Midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois that Michael has returned to wreak havoc on Halloween night.

Since Jamie Lee Curtis' career had taken off considerably since she first played Laurie Strode in the first two films, she could not reprise her role. Laurie's absence is explained away briefly, having died in a car crash a year before the events of Halloween 4Her character was replaced by Laurie's orphaned daughter Jame Lloyd, played by the adorable Danielle Harris. Jamie finds herself being plagued by nightmares of her masked uncle whom she's never met before and ultimately becomes the target of Michael's rampage. Harris manages to prevent Jamie from becoming a shrill, annoying character you wish Michael would eviscerate, and you actually care about her well-being.

The supporting cast also do their best to keep this film from being another silly 80's slasher filled with disposable characters, something the series is incapable of avoiding with the follow-up Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. In Halloween 4, there is a love triangle between Jamie's adopted sister Rachel (played by Ellie Cornell), her prospective boyfriend Brady (played by Sasha Jensen), and busty blonde tart Kelly Meeker (played by the ever-gorgeous Kathleen Kinmont). Kelly's the daughter of the town's new sheriff, Ben Meeker (Beau Starr), who serves as the disbelieving voice to Loomis' urging that Michael Myers has returned to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill his young niece.

Dwight Little directs the film quite deftly, adding a dark, foggy atmosphere that separates this film from the countless other identical slasher films out there. Alan Howarth's showtrack is a mix of ambient sounds and synth, occasionally pop-infused renditions of John Carpenter's simple yet classic orchestrations. Their work gives the movie a sense of dread and fear that many of its horror peers (and even its peers within the Halloween franchise) severely lack. And the film's zinger of a twist finale, leaves you wanting to know what happens next, but after watching Halloween 5, you'll wish you never found out.

In all, Halloween 4 is a return to form for the Halloween franchise and a worthy sequel, even without the original's main star. And the best part? No kung-fu Busta Rhymes!",1252368000,3,3678,5.204391891891892
331789,3,630130053X,"The original ""Halloween"" is one of the best of the slasher genre. Unfortunately, its known for its terrible sequels. This fourth entry is the best to pick up the Michael Myers storyline, as the best sequel had no Michael in it (""Season of the Witch"")

This film is moody and dark like ""Halloween"" should be, but not as boring as all of the others. Great dialogue (Slutty character:""I have to do what's best for me"" Virginal heroine: ""Don't you mean what you do best?"", believable characters and a threatening Michael. His murders here are gruesome.

The drawbacks: This is just ""Halloween gone 80s"". Alot of moments are predictable. There's a fair share of disapppointing 80s cliches as far as the plot: Sheriff's daughter is hot, virginal heroine has cheating boyfriend, angry redneck mob, etc. We also get a ridiculously unnecessary EXPLOSION early on in the movie. The infamous ending is really more cheesy and laughable than scary. Gotta love the campy Donald Pleasance acting though ""NOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOO NAH-OOOOOOO!"" The ending really setup a better sequel nicely though. But we didn't get one.

And besides the murdering, this Michael isn't very menacing at all. His mask is especially lame. This version lacks any screen presence or charisma. He just looks like a nerd.

In summary, this is probably the second best Michael Myers film. A strong attempt to revitalise Michael that mostly works, but the film just doesn't wow you anywhere. I could go another 7 or 8 years without seeing it again.",1248393600,4,1501,4.944444444444445

The film succeeds in scares and even some good thrilling action but falls short in some small corners with the true terror and build up that the first 2 really captured so well. The script is pretty good though, and Michael Myers is still looking scary, even though he looks very different than he did in the first 2...Not to mention he is noticeably stronger...much stronger, and more violent, and taller.

331792,4,630130053X,"Halloween 4 is probably the best sequel (or just plain entry) in the Halloween series.  That being said, this is the movie where Michael Myers stops being merely an escaped lunatic from an asylum wearing a mask and becomes something almost as unstoppable (and therefore kind of uninteresting) as Jason Voorhees from the 4th rate 'Friday the 13th Series'.  Michael Myers can seemingly do anything and be anywhere ... there's no escaping him and so the tension is never amped up like it was in the first, classic 'Hallween.'  BUT -- the creative team behind this movie actually put together a really good slasher movie.  What would degenerate into Halloween's 5 and 6 and sub-mental movie-making hasn't happened yet, and Halloween 4 delivers something almost as restained and suspensful as the original.  Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell are a cut above the normal teen victims, and Donald Pleasence delivers his best performance as Dr. Loomis, the psychiatrist bent on destroying his escaped mental patient.  In fact, Pleasence manages to wring some sympathy for his character in this movie.  And of course, Michael Myers remains the best ongoing character in a slasher series.  Even at his worst, he's still better than the Jasons and Freddies of the movie world.  Part of it is that great mask, part the John Carpenter music, and part the fact that even as cheapie entries go, the Halloween franchise at least tried to deliver some top-shelf shocks.  Halloween 4 is the best entry in the series (after the first) ... it holds a place when he was walking the line between escaped murderer and all-knowing and all-powerful superbeing.  It's the last time Michael Myers isn't completely invincible.",1241308800,,1697,5.00355871886121

331796,4,630130053X,"HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!

  In the fourth installment of the ""Halloween"" franchise, it is October 31, 1988 - ten years after Michael Myers massacred sixteen people.  We learn that Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and Myers survived the hospital fire.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband have been dead for eleven months.  Their eight-year-old daughter, Jamie, is living with foster parents.  Myers escapes while being transported from one psychiatric hospital to another; he is determined to travel to Haddonfield and kill his niece.

  How can this be when Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode in ""Halloween:  H2O?""  She is very much alive and has a son, not a daughter.  In order to rationalize away the lack of storyline continuity, I pretend that installments four through six occur in a parallel time universe.  Now that we've settled that, on with my review.

  ""Halloween 4"" has a large body count; Michael Myers is stronger and more ferocious than ever.  He is now very similar to his number one serial killer competition, Jason Voorhees.  Myers likes dismembering his victims.  He leaves a bloody mess at the crash site of the ambulance, the garage, the police station, and the sheriff's house.  Unfortunately, most of the killings are done off screen; we only see the gruesome aftermath.

  Naturally, Donald Pleasance gives an excellent performance as the fire-scarred Dr. Loomis.  The real star, however, is Danielle Harris who portrays sweet little Jamie Lloyd.  It is quite nerve wracking to see her being relentlessly pursued by Myers.  There is quite a bit of grisly violence throughout this Halloween night.  The most memorable scene is when Myers slaughters a truck full of rednecks.

  The ending was quite shocking.  It leads one to believe that the evil that possessed Michael Myers has found a new body to inhabit and that the nightmare has begun again.

  ""Halloween 4"" is a must see for fans of high body count slasher films, especially the ones that dominated the theatres in the mid-eighties.  Fans of Michael Myers won't be disappointed.  However, they must keep telling themselves that this Myers is from a parallel universe and that Laurie Strode will eventually appear in a later sequel.",1225411200,,2268,5.065217391304348

331830,5,630130053X,"It's about time that they finally got around to making a HALLOWEEN IV resurrecting Michael Myers from HALLOWEEN I and II and got it released on DVD.

This was a great Halloween addition, despite George Wilbur's role as Michael Myers not being as creepy or as sophisticated nor as convincing as Nick Castle role as Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN I and Dick Warlock's role as Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN 2, since Michael didn't do his heavy-breathing the way Myers did in both HALLOWEEN II and the original, plus the music score in HALLOWEEN 4 wasn't quite as good nor as creepy as the music scores used in both the first 2 HALLOWEEN's.

On the other hand, HALLOWEEN IV made a great resurrection by bringing Michael Myers back in the Fall of 1988 after HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH bombed at the box office back in the Fall of 1982 along with the fact that me and a lot of other Halloween fanatics had wished for Michael Myers to come back as well as another HALLOWEEN addition to the Halloween saga to plot a revenge in his hometown(Haddonfield, Illinois) after 10 years trying to repeat the same disaster and ordeal he caused in Haddonfield back in the Fall of 1978 with Donald Pleasance reprising his role as the now fire-scarred obsessed Dr. Loomis hot on Myers trail again unsuccessfully attempting to prevent another disasterous Halloween night in the remote Haddonfield.

It's just too bad they had taken so long to make a HALLOWEEN 4, which didn't finally come out till 6 years after the cheesy unsuccessful HALLOWEEN 3 came out, because between Halloween sequels that took place between the original and HALLOWEEN III, they ended up waiting 7 years to make another Halloween sequel with Michael Myers in it, since the last Halloween installation with Michael Myers prior to HALLOWEEN 4 was HALLOWEEN 2, which theatrical release was in the Fall of 1981, which was a pretty long time to wait to bring back the successful character of all the Halloween movies.

Therefore; in HALLOWEEN IV the producers had to improvise by revising the story & conclusion to what supposedly ended up happening on Halloween night of 1978 since HALLOWEEN 2 concluded with Loomis and Myers presumably dying off in the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital fire explosion, but in this flick Loomis and Myers miraculously didn't die in that hospital fire after all, but had nearly burned to death after Loomis set Myers on fire during that hospital expolosion leaving Myers in a presumed 10-year coma until he finally awakens from it in this movie on Halloween Eve of 1988 to relive his killing-spree.

I don't think director(Dwight Little) did as good of a job with HALLOWEEN 4 as John Carpenter did in HALLOWEEN I and Rick Rosenthal did with HALLOWEEN II.

Therefore, I think HALLOWEEN IV probably would've been better and quite a bit more shocking if John Carpenter had directed it, since he did a phenomenal job making HALLOWEEN I along with all the music scoring he did in both the original and HALLOWEEN 2 along with using his creative phenomenal HALLOWEEN Theme that was also used in HALLOWEEN I and II, which reminds me that HALLOWEEN IV came out the same year that both FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII: THE NEW BLOOD and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART IV: THE DREAM MASTER did, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 7 was released in the movie theatre in the Spring of 1988, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART 4 was released in the Summer of 1988 and HALLOWEEN 4 was released in the Autumn of 1988.

The one thing that baffles me that didn't make a lot of sense about HALLOWEEN IV is how was Michael Myers able to see again and how was Michael Myers able to know that his kid sister Laurie Strode(Jamie-Lee Curtis) was dead and how was Michael to know what his niece Jamie(Danielle Harris)even looked like since Michael had both his eyes shot out in HALLOWEEN II and had been incapaccitated in a deep-sleep for 10 years after Halloween night of 1978 and how would he even know to track his adopted niece instead of his sister, since Laurie was no where to be found and was supposedly dead already, since Michael had never even laid eyes on Jamie along with the fact that Michael had already been in a coma before Jamie was even born.

The other thing that baffles me about HALLOWEEN IV is in this sequel; the fictional remote town of Haddonfield is bigger, prettier, more colorful, and quite alive for a town that is located in a secluded area, but in HALLOWEEN I the city of Haddonfield was like a ghost-town since Haddonfield was smaller, quieter, less colorful, and even more rural than it was in this movie, but perhaps it was due to the fact that the filming locations in HALLOWEEN 4 took place in Salt Lake City, Utah back in the Spring of 1988, but in the orginal HALLOWEEN the filming locations took place in the L.A. Area, especially in Pasadena and Hollywood which was why producers had to import Autumn leaves during its filming in Southern California back in the Spring of 1978.

However; my guess on why they had decided to bring Michael Myers back and were prompted to make HALLOWEEN 4 was due to the fact that HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH had toppled so badly at the box office with very poor reviews back in the Autumn of 1982 after it was released in the movies back in October 1982, since HALLOWEEN III had no Michael Myers, no Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance), no Laurie, and no Sheriff Brackett(Charles Cyphers), especially no Michael Myers, but the only reason why HALLOWEEN 3 was unrelated to HALLOWEEN I and 2 was due to the fact that John Carpenter & Debra Hill only agreed to produce another sequel if HALLOWEEN III had no Michael Myers since they felt Michael had run his course.

Overall, HALLOWEEN IV was not a bad flick, even though HALLOWEEN 4 wasn't quite as good as the first 2 HALLOWEENs, but was still way better than HALLOWEEN III: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH was, especially since HALLOWEEN 3 was the weakest sequel to the whole Halloween saga and was totally unrelated to the rest of the Halloween installments, especially from HALLOWEEN I and II.

The only thing I find kind of odd is why didn't the producers use Michael Myers new mask that he used in this HALLOWEEN IV on the cover & poster of this sequel instead of using the mask that he used in the original HALLOWEEN which was actually a STAR TREK Capt. Kirk mask spray painted with white, but in this sequel, they used a more self-made ghoulish Halloween mask that was a little more sophisticated & ghostly, but a little less creepy.",1201737600,3,6486,4.641114982578397

Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was a solid entry in the series, but there were many flaws. As I have gotten older some of these movies don't hold up as well and Halloween 4 is one of those movies for me that doesn't work quite as well as it once did.

Halloween 4 was one of the better slasher movies to come out of the 80s and probably one of the best if not the best of the late 80s, which isn't saying much since by the time Halloween 4 rolled around the slasher movie was pretty much dead and hanging on by a thread.

Writer Alan B. McElroy does a solid job at creating likeable characters with some depth; which is something that often lacks in these movies. Apparently Alan McElroy wrote the script in just 10 days to avoid the writer's strike that was looming and even though he did do a fine job I think at times it does show the script was rushed. Again I think the script was good and just might be the best written of all the sequels it could have used some touch up in some spots.

Director Dwight H. Little does capture the mid-west fall setting perfectly. There are some problems though. While Dwight Little isn't a terrible director he isn't a great one either. I have seen some of his work and while they weren't great movies some were enjoyable and at the end of the day that is all that matters to me. Halloween 4 had some good pacing, but also some poor pacing. Maybe poor pacing isn't the right word. By this time there wasn't much left to do in slasher flicks and what would have worked well a couple of years earlier doesn't so well at times here.

Dwight Little is no John Carpenter and Michael stalking and watching doesn't work nearly as well as it does in the original. While there is a decent feel of dread it never has the tension the original has at all. There are moments where you get a sense of looming danger, but there just seems to be something that is a bit off. It's obvious Dwight Little was a fan of the original there are many scenes where he tries to channel what Carpenter did. Some of those moments work others not as much.

The biggest strength of Halloween 4 is also its biggest weakness; instead of being your typical run of the mill slasher movie the makers try and be more than that. The characters are well developed something most slasher films lack, Alan McElroy and Dwight Little could have taken the easy way out and deliver the typical slasher film with a lot of kill scenes and gore.

They both focus more on suspense and tension and characters, but it just doesn't work at times. Despite having a decent body count it can feel like a long stretch in between kill scenes and as I stated before Michael stalking his victims just doesn't work quite as well and after a while it starts to slow the pacing of the movie down too much. The longer Halloween 4 went without a death scene it started to drag. The original was able to go stretches without one, but that was a greatly made movie.

Like I said Halloween aims to bring more depth to the characters instead of the typical characters we normally get, but while it worked it also slowed the pace down at times. The funny thing is though of all the Halloween movies, Halloween 4 might have the most solid cast of characters. But there is still just something missing here. The sub-plot with Rachel and Brady, while maybe a little out of place for a slasher flick does adds a lot more depth to both characters.

As I stated earlier the biggest problem though is by this time the slasher movie was pretty much dead there really wasn't any new ground that could be explored. Halloween 4 was better than a lot of the slasher flicks of the 80s it does suffer a bit from there been there done that. Despite some problems Halloween 4 has some excellent moments; the scenes in Sheriff Meeker's house are quite well done with some good tension and the roof top scene rates as one of the best moments of the series. The ending was really well done and even quite creepy.

All the characters are well done and even the characters with the smaller roles are well developed and you get a feel of what they are like. All the actors play their roles excellent and come across as real people. So there is more good here than bad; but I still can't help, but feel there was just something missing. I can't quite place my finger on what exactly it was.

Normally in horror movies children get on my nerves, but Danielle Harris is the exception; she comes across as a real kid and when she is supposed to look terrified she does. Obviously the strongest link to Halloween 4 is Donald Pleasence; without him I don't think the movie would have worked all that well. Slasher movies are known for not having the smartest characters, but sometimes things go a little too far. One scene that always bothered me is when Michael is hiding in the back of the cop car. When he gets out and the cop comes back and sees the door open he pays no mind to it.

That scene really always bothered me with all that is going on one would think the cop might think that was a bit weird. The biggest flaw of the movie is towards the end. After Rachel and Jamie escape from the school and meet up with the town rednecks some how Michael is able to escape from the school and get under the truck. And some how he manages to throw them off the back of the truck one by one. Nobody notices anything? That is just sloppy filmmaking. And the reason it bothers me so much is that for the most part Halloween 4 is a well made movie. Slasher movies in general aren't all that well made, they might be fun, but not well made. Halloween 4 though is a well crafted movie despite the flaws.

Halloween 4 gets off to a solid start, but never is able to fully get back on track. That is why I say the pacing was just some what off at times. I'm not one who needs a death every couple of minutes to hold my interest, but Halloween 4 while having a decent body count could have used maybe one or two more in the middle sections. Dwight Little goes for suspense over what the typical slasher film at this time was doing, which was the more dead, the better. So the biggest strength for Halloween 4 is also its biggest weakness.

There really isn't anybody to blame in particular. The actors play their roles well, McElroy's script is pretty good and as a director Little does a pretty solid job. But even with all of those factors some of the middle sections just don't seem to work as well as they could have. It just gets a little too slow and that is I said adding a kill or two would have helped out the pacing.

Donald Pleasence is great like always, but he really doesn't have much to do besides pretty much repeat what he said in the original. Pleasence is one of my favorite actors and has done many great movies. The thing about Pleasence is he knew when to play a role straight and he knew when to go a little over the top. Problem here is he's just not given much to do. I cannot even begin to imagine Halloween 4 without him, and since Donald's death the series just hasn't been the same, but I can't help but feel he was brought back for the sake of coming back. While it would have been maybe a little tougher I think Halloween 4 could have worked without him. I love the actor and character so I'm fine that he came back, but he really didn't serve much of a purpose besides rehashing what he did in the original.

Halloween 4 was the first one I had seen in theaters; previously it was all on home video. So Halloween 4 will always have a special place with me and like many kids my first crush was Danielle Harris. But the older I get I seem to enjoy this one a little less.

The ending of Halloween 4 was quite well-done and chilling. Besides the original Halloween this one had the best ending. There were many of the best moments of the series to be found here, it's just as a whole I don't think everything fully worked. My review may not sound all that positive, but I do enjoy Halloween 4, just not as much as I did as a child.",1193011200,,8205,4.266881028938907

This film isn't quite like a lot of horror films around the time it was made and now because it doesnt really rely on blood and gore to scary the piss out of you.  It mostly relys on the atmosphere of a dark night and the music.  Thats what great horror films are all about is if they can scare you without even showing anything that is remotely scary.  This film is an example of that concept.  The script, the acting, and the score are incredible.  Especially for a horror film.  Ive noticed after seeing many horror films that this movie feels like Jaws or Gone With the Wind in terms of quality of every single aspect within it.  The shape is performed very good here.  The mask is cool as well, unlike what many people say.  Here we find the greatest ending of any other Halloween film and one of the best ever filmed.  Very good script that is pretty tight through the entire movie.  This is a fantastic horror film that still amazes viewers because its aging very well.

This 4th installment(3rd featuring Michael) is OK if you can get past the improbability of the good Dr. Loomis and Michael surviving the explosion at the hospital in the second film.  The film has a slick look and there are some decent chills and thrills along the way, but in the end, you feel like you have seen it all before. Not the worst in the series......that's for sure!",1180396800,,551,4.455445544554456
331852,5,630130053X,"In 1988, 10 years after the original Halloween terrorized audiences, Director Dwight H. Little teamed up with executive producer Moustapha Akkad to create what is arguably the greatest Halloween sequel to date.

Laurie Stode's little 8 year old daughter Jamie Lloyd is now orphaned due to a fatal car crash.  Michael in the midst of a transfer of sanitariums escapes leaving a bloody ambulence behind.  Only Dr. Loomis knows where Michael is heading, and again after 10 years time, nobody believes him.  Haddenfield recieves one more night of unholy terror as Michael comes closer and closer to his ultimate goal of killing Jamie.

This film is really effective now and especially when it first came out.  In 1988 we saw such great sequels to other horror franchises such as Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason takes Manhatten and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.  I'm being sarcastic of course as neither of these films got large profit at the box office.  This was a fresh and well done shot for the Halloween series.  With such memorable sequences such as the roof top chase and the car chase at the end, this movie has very little flaws.  i guess my only criticism is that I don't find Michael nearly as scary with sideburns on his mask.  This film blew me away as being the best sequel to Halloween.  The ending is also the most affective ending aside from H20 and Halloween.

The Divimax edition of this film gives us two new audio commentaries from the likes of Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris (the two main actors in the movie).  Their commentary is good an fun but they don't really know that much about the series or the film itself, I found myself knowing more than they did.  Alan B. McElroy's commentary is very immformative and flows well with the movie.  It also includes a panal discussion on Halloween 4 and 5 from the 25th anneversary convention which is a great addition as you don't find this particular discussion on the H25: 25 years of terror dvd.

This film deserves 5 stars for giving Halloween a fresh start and the sequel it deserved from the getgo.  Sadly, the next two entries sorely lack in the originality that this film brought or the freshness it brought to the franchise.",1178928000,2,2217,4.655526992287918
331853,5,630130053X,"As a fan of this great series I have to say that HalloweeN 4 The Return Of Micheal Myers is very good and recommend.  Since HalloweeN 3 was a flop since the boogey man wasn't involve why not bring him back 10 year's after the original HalloweeN apeared.  Alan Howarth the music composer for this and HalloweeN 5 did a great job of mixing John Carpentars HalloweeN Theme.

Now for the movie, suspense wise it caught me and my wife off guard.  Normally Micheal never uses the same attack twice as in one scene in which he uses a shot gun for another purpose.  The mask was too bright and the actor who played Myers seems to be short and while hearing the audio commentaries that the guy was using hockey equipment under the cover alls.  Danielle Harris did a excellent job in her debut movie career narrowling beating a young Melissa Joan Heart (Sabrina The Teenage Witch) for the role.  Donald Plesance as Doctor Loomis is always a treat to watch until HalloweeN 5-6.  Overall a great combat for Micheal Myers to revive the HalloweeN series until they miss things up in the the finale of HalloweeN 5.  HalloweeN 6 is not worth mentioning until H20 came in, HalloweeN Ressurection had a good opening but drag along. With mostly the main characters of HalloweeN being killed off (Lauaie Strode, Jamie Strode, Dr. Loomis, whats left for Micheal Myers to attack now?  His baby that Jamie conceived in HalloweeN 6?  The son of Laruie Strode from HalloweeN H20? Now that Rob Zombie is doing a remake of the original I can't wait what the king of gore will do with this franchize.",1173139200,,1572,4.539007092198582

331888,4,630130053X,"As another reviewer said, quite often sequels of horror movies decrease, quality-wise, from the originals (Friday the 13th take note!). This one, however, is the exception to the rule.

Halloween 4 was actually the first of the Halloween films I ever saw. I was too young to see the first 3 (though the third did not include Michael Myers) and my parents didn't want to get a VCR.

This film scared me half to death when I saw it in a theater at age 17! I was vaguely familiar with the storyline of Halloween 1 & 2 (my friends had seen them) so I kind of was familiar with the 2 lead characters - Dr. Loomis & Michael Myers. The film opens as an ambulance makes its way through a thunderstorm to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael Myers has been a guest in a coma for the last 10 years. While Myers is in the ambulance & being moved to an institute in Smith's Grove, IL, he overhears one of the crew mention a niece in his home town of Haddonfield and suddenly bursts to life, savagely killing the crew trapped inside. Dr. Loomis, burned on his hand & face after Halloween 2, follows Myers towards Haddonfield after the ambulance is found upside-down in a river with blood everywhere. Young Jamie Lloyd, Myers' niece, has no idea about the horror that is coming after her, and her foster sister Rachel tries to comfort her by taking her trick-or-treating. But while they are looking for a costume, Myers confronts Jamie, and then vanishes quickly. Loomis, meanwhile, has alerted Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) and they start hunting for Jamie & Rachel after Myers knocks out the power. Myers, however, is hunting Jamie & Rachel, and he encounters them in the sheriff's home...

Director Dwight. H. Little & screenwriter Alan McElroy have done a respectable job of bringing Michael Myers back to the screen. The pacing is tight, the production design distinctly creates a 'creepy' atmosphere both in the town of Haddonfield & outiside it at Ridgemont. The late Donald Pleasance, as always, plays Dr. Loomis convincingly, and Ellie Cornell as Rachel and Danielle Harris as Jamie are also very talented. While he has absolutely no lines in the film, George P. Wilbur conveys a terrifying Michael Myers - almost like an automaton, but unbelievably cunning and inhumanly patient.

The 'Final Cut' documentary featured on the DVD is quite interesting watching, featuring interviews with some of the cast, director Little, executive producer Moustapha Akkad, and screenwriter McElroy. It seemed a little short though.

This is a fine DVD; not to be missed if you are a horror fan!",1154649600,2,2587,4.778523489932886

331917,4,630130053X,"10 Years ago on Halloween night, Michael Myers returned home to kill his sister (Laurie Strode). Michael survived being blown up by his doctor and has been held deep in the bowels of Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium.

During a routine transfer to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, Michael escapes custody in search of his only living relative Jamie Lloyd. His niece living in his hometown of Haddonfield.

Dr. Loomis, who also survived that night, is still Michael's doctor and despite what happened 10 years is the only one convinced Myers will return home.

Michael finds his way home and manages to locate his young niece while wrecking havoc on the small town. Loomis convinces the new Sheriff (Ben Meeker) to help him find and stop Myers.

Trapped in the Sheriffs home, Myers pursues young Jamie and her step sister Rachel until the police eventually catch up with them and send Myers to his grave in an old abandoned mine shaft. later that evening, Jamie becomes possessed by the spirit of Michael and attacks her step-mother (A.K.A Judith Myers style) as Loomis watches in horror...........The nightmare continues.

After being absent from the horror scene for six years, Michael made his return to the big screen and, at that time, didn't disappoint fans and audiences across the globe. In 1988, Friday the 13th had reached sequel number 7 and Nightmare on Elm Street had reached sequel number 4, so people were ready for a new fresh approach from an old favorite in the horror genre.

The director (Dwight H. Little) attempted to create the same vibe from the first film. Using low & wide camera angles he was able to achieve a ""HALLOWEEN"" vibe without ripping off the original film. Alan Howarth (Halloween II) was back to compose the soundtrack and once again John Carpenter's theme was back in business.

But after almost 17 years, does this film stand the test of time like the original ""HALLOWEEN"" does?

Well, sort of. Young Danielle Harris did an excellent job conveying the fear and terror from a child's point of view. Donald Pleasence returns to deliver a solid performance as a man obsessed with his fight to stop evil. The other cast members do a very good job to bring together the story and for the most part, there was a story to tell.

This time around the Akkads had to come up with a new idea, it had to be fresh and unfortunately it had to continue Carpenter's idea of the ""sister theory"".

SISTER THEORY = MYERS MUST KILL HIS FAMILY.

  THIS THEORY HAS PLAGUED THE HALLOWEEN SERIES AND IS

  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRID SEQUELS THAT FOLLOW.

It also needed to explain how Michael & Loomis survived what Carpenter felt was an inescapable death. They managed to pull that off, barely. Too bad the rest of the story felt rushed and finishes with a whimper instead of a bang. You're bringing back Michael ""F*cking"" Myers, make it good. You only had Six years to think of a better story then being shot down a well and left for dead!

In the first film no one believed Dr. Loomis. Everyone thought he was crazy for thinking that Michael would come home. Needless to say he was proven right. So, why in the hell would anyone doubt his intentions even after 10 years. If Loomis is in your town, so is Michael Myers.

Plus the mask in this film is just BAD!!!!!!!. It was a poorly converted William Shatner mask and inspires comedy more then terror.  This only goes to prove that the producers of Halloween 4 did not have a clue about what made the first film so scary.

Halloween 4 is still one of the best post Halloween III sequels made, next to H20, and was a fresh approach at the same story. It was also the reason why we have so many bad sequels that do nothing except make money. Damn you Akkads, for letting him out again!!!!!!!",1138579200,,3745,4.6184012066365

This time Myers has a new target, a new bunch of unsuspecting victims to slaughter and new mystique about his personality.

This would be the beginning of the ""Jamie"" trilogy, and the new story line works well for the movie (at least in this installment). Chances are if you were a fan of either of the first two movies you should find plenty to be pleased with about this movie.

First off Michael Myers is indeed, as we had all suspected, not dead. It seems he just went into a coma and did not die at the end of Halloween II (despite taking 12 bullets to the chest, being shot in both of his eyes, and having his body set ablaze). It also seems Dr. Loomis (also presumed to be dead at the end of Halloween II) merely escaped the blazing boiler room with only a mild facial scaring. Loomis however believes that Myers will not remain in this vegetative state for long, and once he awakes, he will return to his old murderous ways. Of course no one believes Loomis' assumptions, which forces Dr. Loomis to watch his worst fears unfold before his eyes. While being transported to another hospital for safe keeping, Myers comes to in an ambulance and kills the personal after learning he has a niece, still residing in Haddonfield. His instinct to kill any female family member he has of course takes over. Enter Jamie, Michael's unsuspecting surviving niece. In the ten years that have passed since the events of the first two movies, Laurie Strode gave birth to Jamie and then was ""apparently"" killed in a car accident, upon which Jamie was adopted by a new family. Jamie has been having dreams and visions of her murderous uncle, although everyone dismisses them, despite her undeniable feelings that Myers is close by. Of course Myers once again returns on the night of Halloween, this time to ""take care"" of his niece. While the plot has some holes (a pointless love triangle sub plot between Rachel, the sheriff's daughter, and Rachel's supposed boyfriend, and Jamie apparently murdering her adoptive mother and then standing at the top of the stairs in front of Loomis, which was all but ignored in the fifth movie) it's definitely some great ideas flowing through out. There are plenty of genuinely creepy moments in the movie, like when Rachel is talking to the deputy in the Sheriff's house, and you see Myers face peek out of the shadows in the background, only to retreat at the first notion of the deputy to look, or when Loomis and the Sheriff are surrounding be a group of Myers look-a-likes, or when Jamie has her Myers hallucination in her room. The killings aren't nearly as scary as the ones found in the first movie, and most tend to focus more on the gore or graphic violence to get their point across. However Michael's trademark slow head turn after killing a victim is still found, which creates a few disturbing moments. The cast is great, most especially Danielle Harris, who plays Jamie. She really has a way of exerting genuine fear, and she can scream as well as any actress I've seen in a horror movie. Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is a great heroine in the vein of Jamie Lee Curtis of the first two movies, and definitely adds a lot to her character. And of course you get the ever present Donald Pleasence once again playing Dr. Loomis, who may seem a bit old and tired in this installment, but still has plenty of the charisma he displayed in the original movie. While the atmosphere isn't nearly as haunting or creepy as the original, there are definitely plenty of moments to induce a cringe or squirm, making the film a definite must see.

I credit Halloween 4 for the new ideas it introduced into the series. The movie could have been a lot worse than it actually turned out, which is a welcome surprise. Taking the focus off of Laurie Strode does wonders for the movie, and definitely gave the movie a breathe of fresh air. While the latter movies (5 and 6 in particular) would practically kill anything this movie attempted to get going, it is still a worth-while viewing in itself. It's not perfect, but if you're a fan of Michael Myers or any of the Halloween movies, then I think you will be able to look over its flaws, and find an enjoyable movie. And remember ""You Can't Kill The Boogeyman!""",1131235200,,4678,4.6011976047904195
331920,3,630130053X,"This movie is a step forward from 3 but a step backwards, when compared to the first 2 Halloweens. Dwight H. Little is not a very creative director, which i think hurts some of the scares and tone of the movie.

The story is alright, it's not hard to follow, but it is decent. The acting is surprisingly good, i give a lot of credit to young Danielle Harris as Jamie, who was 11 when this film was made. Seeing Donald Pleasence back as Dr. Loomis was really great, Donald Pleasence is such a great actor and his performance really drives Halloween 4. Ellie Cornell is another great actress brought along for the ride, playing Rachel.

George P. Wilbur as Michael Myers is not really impressive when compared to Nick Castle from Halloween 1. Much like Halloween 2, Halloween 4 has Myers walk like a robot, which doesn't work.

Overall, a 3 out of 5. It has flaws but it is a major improvement over 3 and even though it could have been better, it also could have been worse.

 Danielle Harris, the little girl who plays Jamie is a fantastic, very believable actor for her age, and is better than a lot of the adults.  The girl who plays Rachel also does a great job.  Overall I don't have any complaints with the acting.

 The movie isn't terrifying by any means, but it's just scary enough to be fun.  I loved the surprise scene that came just before one of the characters was impaled through the stomache (those of you who watched the movie know the scene and character I'm talking about).  The music is simple but brilliant as ever.  And there are a ton of action-packed and suspenseful scenes.

 Granted, I've only watched 1, 4, 5, and most of Resurrection (yuck!  And WTF is Busta Rhymes doing in the movie??), but Halloween 4 is almost as great as the first one was.  Halloween 5 is worth watching for the Halloween fan, but the teenagers are so damn annoying and it takes FOREVER for anything interesting to happen.

 I remain firm that 1 and 4 are the best of the series.",1130716800,,1267,4.5198237885462555

Again, Dr. Loomis [Donald Pleasance] must stop Michael from claiming yet another victim. Now, This is what the first sequel failed to be. This is actually suspenseful and it's fun to watch, Even though the presence of Jamie Lee Curtis is missing this time around. In my mind, Things were never quite the same after this sequel and it goes to show ya, Things should've stopped here. There was no need for anymore halloween movies beyond this one. Really, There wasn't really any need for any halloween sequels at all. Imagine what it would be like if there was only 1 halloween movie and there wasn't a series of sequels to follow it. But, This one was good and i think this is as good as things are gonna get as far as the halloween sequels are concerned. Also, This is one of the tamer entries of the series, Being that there's no nudity and less gore. This is the best Halloween sequel to date. Trust me on that.

331964,4,630130053X,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I think Part 1 is a classic; part 2 is...well...acceptable; part 3 has nothing to do with the series; part 4 is excellent; part 5 is arguably the best; and part 6 is, well an acceptable conclusion with some flaws. (I don't count the sickening farces 'H20' and 'Resurection.') Well, onto the subject at hand. Part 2 was probably meant to be the conclusion, but fortunately, this excellent sequel came to pass. By all the laws of nature, Michael and Dr. Loomis should have been dead at the end of Part 2, but Part 4 starts with a quick statement that informs us that they ALMOST died. And ofcourse, almost only counts in horseshoes. (They cheated a little, but let's forgive them!) The start of this movie sets the mood as we learn that Jamie Lee Curtis died, but she did have one daughter. (Granted, it is strange that Jamie Lee Curtis survived Michael Myers only to die later in an accident, but we'll let that slide.) It isn't long before Michael pulls himself back together and starts killing again. And when Michael comes back, the benevolent, but scarred (mentally and physically) Dr. Loomis comes on the scene. This is arguably Donald's best movie. I mean no disrespect towards the classic Part 1, but it is in this 4th chapter that we see the best view of Dr. Loomis. He is benevolent, but he does NOT really get along with his superiors. Mind you, they don't think much of him either: ""If Dr. Loomis read memos, he'd be here...It's my hope that he'll either transfer, retire, or die."" Another great thing about Dr. Loomis is that in this 4th chapter, he shows his redneckish side. By that, I mean that he doesn't let official stories, or what 'should be' infect his common sense. When the police and his superiors tell him that there is no way Michael could have walked away from the wreck, he responds: ""You're not going to find him...You talk about him as if he were  human."" After Donald's 1st confrontation with Michael, there is an EXCELLENT scene of comic relief. On the road, Dr. Loomis is scorned by a group of hormone driven kids. (This probably foreshadows Michael's victims.) And then, the heroic Dr. Loomis is given a ride by a good Samaritan who seems psychologically scarred from fighting damnation. WHAT A FANTASTIC PARALLEL! (This is one of the few times we see Dr. Loomis smile.) Jamie (Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter), makes her 1st appearance, and she delivers quite well. She is an emotionally scarred child who is not only adjusting to her step family, but is dealing with her tragic past that may very well creep into her present. One nice thing about Part 4 is that it is more colorful and comical than Parts 1 and 2. This provides a nice balance of comedy and horror. (And it allows us to get to know Michael's potential victims a little before they are slaugtered.) In my opinion, it's hard to feel for characters we never really got to know. Moving on, there is an excellent scene where Dr. Loomis and the sheriff discover the police station soaked in blood, to which Dr. Loomis answers: ""They didn't know what they were fighting."" This leads to a lynch mob roaming the streets desperate to stop Michael. But how effective is a lynch mob if they don't know what they are fighting? Overall, it is a good combination of suspense, comedy, and horror. I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but while some people may have been able to predict the ending, it's not too obvious. (Though I will say you might want to have a copy of Part 5 on hand as well as the time to watch it.

It goes a little downhill for the finale as Michael's ability to teleport himself (seems that way) stretches credibility a bit too far.

332009,3,630130053X,"Let's face it, horror movies usually suck, and it was always inevitable that a sequel about Michael Myers coming back to Haddonfield in Illinois was a given. Halloween 2 valiantly continued the story of the killer and it was supposed to end with that one as it truly ended with a true bang. But of course the money hungry hands of Hollywood could only keep Michael at bay for so long. Skipping over III completely, (which had nothing to do with Michael Myers, we have Part 4, The Return of Michael Myers.

John Carpenter is gone, with the exception of his themed music, we have director Dwight Little taking a stab at the Halloween story. Carpenter is sorely missed, but amazingly, this is a scary movie and keeps the faith of Carpenters original, well almost. Carpenter agreed after Part II that there simply wasn't really any storyline left for the character. Looks like Part 4 proved that wrong. With the exception of Donald Pleasance (Loomis), the original cast of characters from 1978 are totally gone. Loomis renews his role as Michael's doctor. As stated in another review, basically ignore the end of part II, as both Michael and Loomis should be dead, literally. (they were basically burned alive).

Part 4 concerns the daughter of (Jamie Lee Curtis) Lorie Strode. Jamie Lee supposedly died and her daughter was adopted by a new family in Haddonfield. Michael Myers of course, laying nearly dead from Part II, hears about the little girl in his dark asylum. He, of course, wants to kill finish off the rest of the family, so of course he now gets out, and goes after the daughter of Laurie Strode.

Jamie Lee is nowhere to be found in the movie as her character was believed to have died in car wreck, but we certainly find that to be untrue with the future release of H20 - 20 Years Later. Halloween 4 is a very dark movie. Nearly 75%, not surprisingly takes place at night. The movie, similar to the original, focuses more on suspense and only a small amount of gore. The pacing is fast and keeps you in suspense for most of the movie. Also true to the Halloween genre, there really isn't much blood in this one as proven once before that you don't need gore and guts to make a good scary movie.

The music score is ""Carpenter"" reminisce all the way with some great use of synthesizers and classic piano themes from the original. If I had one pet peave about the movie is the mask they used. The faceless shape mask of Michael Myers was amazing looking in Part I and Part II. But in part 4, the mask is seems a bit too white, or it's just to bright for it's own good and is not nearly as scary as the ""shapes"" mask in the original. But other than this minor nitpick, the killer ""Michael"" is a force to be recokned with.

Loomis has some fine moments and enjoy him in part 4, because although he returns for the next two Halloween outings, the next two are not worth your time as 4 should have been the last Halloween movie, at least until H20 with the return of Jamie Lee Curtis.

Halloween 1 was the best, Halloween 2 took a close second and then we have Halloween 4 which keeps the faith and is simply a good scary movie. You can never take out an original like Halloween, but thanks to fine acting, great music, and the force of Michael Myers, you'll have fun with this one for sure.

Cast:  Donald Pleasance, Ellie Cornell, Danielle Harris, Beau Starr, Sasha Jenson.

Running Time:  88 minutes.

Rated R for violence, language, and some sexual situations.

John Carpenter (director of the original ""Halloween"" film and executive producer of the first sequel) is absent from this fourth installment in the famous slasher series; however, ""Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a pleasing addition to the series because of its exceptional cinematography, chilling musical score, and sound performances from a young, inexperienced cast.  Donald Pleasance returns once again as Dr. Loomis, the bemused psychiatrist of the maniacal serial killer Michael Myers.  This time, Myers returns to his small hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois in search of his long lost niece (played exceptionally well for newcomer Danielle Harris), but manages to do away with a few sex-romping, unassuming teenagers while he is at it.

This sequel succeeds in part because it concedes the fact that ""Halloween III: The Season of the Witch"" was perhaps one of the worst horror films ever produced, picking up where the second film left off.  Director Dwight H. Little does his best John Carpenter impersonation, creating a stylish, suspenseful thriller with deliberate camera angles to heighten the tension, smaller amounts of gore (compared to ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films), and more focus on the personality of the driven, yet aging Dr. Loomis.  While nothing close to the original, this sequel will certainly gratify fans of the series and any want a good ol' horror romp without all of the modern, gruesome clichs.

332012,5,630130053X,"On October 31st, 1978, Halloween Night, ten years ago, Laurie Strode had been chased around all of Haddonfield by Michael Myers. Laurie saw Michael himself burn to a crisp at the end of the second film. Well, immediately after the second film, Laurie Strode had died in a car-wreck.

  On October 30th, 1988, ten years, since he was burned, MICHAEL MYERS (played by George P. Wilbur) turns out to be still very much alive. Two paramedics are being driven to a maximum-security prison just outside of Smith's Grove, Illinois, where they are picking up Michael Myers and transferring him to the Smith's Grove Mental Institution, where Michael had escaped ten years earlier. They go through with the transfer and head out on their way. The drivers do their job with driving the paramedics back to Smith's Grove as the two paramedics sit in the back and discuss what they were told by DR. HOFFMAN (played by Michael Pataki) while signing for the transfer. It turns out that Michael does have one living relative: JAMIE LLOYD (played by Danielle Harris), his niece; the daughter of...Laurie Strode and she is living in Haddonfield Illinois, with her adopted parents, RICHARD CARRUTHERS (played by Jeff Olson) and DARLENE CARRUTHERS (played by Karen Alston), and her foster sister, RACHEL CARRUTHERS (played by Ellie Cornell). At that moment, the two paramedics and two drivers are killed.

  DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance) is also still alive. discusses with Dr. Hoffman about the transfer with Michael, leading Dr. Loomis into revealing that he hopes and prays that the residents of Haddonfield do not have to live through that horrible night again. At that moment, Hoffman gets a call about the wreck Michael caused with the paramedics. Dr. Loomis and Hoffman drive down and check it out, leading Dr. Loomis to drive off to Haddonfield and once again put an end to Michael's pure madness.

  Dr. Loomis stops at a gas station about 75 to 100 miles away from Haddonfield. He fills up his car with gas and goes into the garage to find the mechanic dead, and stripped of his clothing, in which Michael is now wearing. Loomis sees Michael and pleads with to not go to Haddonfield. He shoots at Michael, but he is gone, leading Michael to drive out of the garage and cause an explosion.

  Jamie is picked up from school by Rachel and...LINDSEY WALLACE (played by Leslie Rohland). Jamie wants to go to the Discount Mart to pick up a costume. Rachel is tense about the idea, since her boyfriend, BRADY (played by Sasha Jenson) works there and Rachel has to cancel their date to babysit Jamie. They arrive at the Discount Mart, where Jamie goes off to find her costume, while Rachel discusses her babysitting job with Brady. Jamie finds the perfect outfit: A red & silver clown costume, the same costume Michael had worn when he killed his older sister.

  Dr. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield. He enters the police station and asks for Sheriff Leigh Brackett. Turns out that Brackett had retired seven years ago and moved three thousand miles south of Haddonfield. The new sheriff of Haddonfield is SHERIFF BEN MEEKER (played by Beau Starr). They head out to find Jamie and Rachel and take them to safety, since Michael is after Jamie.

  While trick or treating with Jamie, they stop at Ben Meeker's house, where his beautiful daughter, KELLY (played by Kathleen Kinmont) answers the door. Rachel notices Brady, where Rachel storms off, pissed. Jamie has seemed to have gotten lost, but Rachel finds her, just as Ben and Loomis pull up. They take the kids back to Meeker's house, since Michael had killed a construction worker, working at the town's power plant, causing the whole town to lose their power.

  Michael is in the house. Loomis and Ben leave to track down three guys from the local bar. Leading the guys is the bar's tender, EARL (played by Gene Ross), who is after Michael, since he killed Earl's son ten years back. Loomis and Ben leave only Rachel, Brady, Jamie, DEPUTY LOGAN, and Kelly. Michael kills of Rachel and Logan and begins the chase. Since the house is nailed shut, trying to keep Michael out, Rachel, Brady, and Jamie have no way out, except through the roof, where Rachel and Jamie run to as Michael kills Brady.

  Rachel and Jamie would have gotten down from the roof safely if Michael hadn't shown up. Jamie gets down safely, after Rachel falls off trying to keep Michael away. As Rachel lay on the ground, unconscious, Jamie runs around screaming for help. She comes across Dr. Loomis and the two enter the schoolhouse. Michael shows up and throws Loomis aside. Rachel comes to Jamie's rescue. As the two exit the school, the guys from the bar come to the girls' aide. They are about to enter the school, but Rachel convinces to stay out in order for them stay alive. The guys drive the girls out of town to safety, where the state troopers are on their way to help them, but the guys die in the process, forcing Rachel to drive the car. Michael is on top of the car, but not for long, as Rachel stops suddenly, sending Michael flying to the ground, where the Haddonfield police, lead by Ben Meeker and Dr. Loomis shoot Michael to the point of falling down the mineshaft.

  The girls return home with Loomis and Meeker. Richard and Darlene are more than relieved. Darlene takes Jamie upstairs to get her ready for bed. But someone picks up a pair of scissors and stabs Darlene Carruthers. Loomis goes to the stairs and screams. Ben, Richard, and Rachel come to the stairs, with horrified looks on their faces. Jamie is responsible.

332014,5,630130053X,"This is a good scary sequel. It is also very dark too.  The beginning is great and the music and the mental hospital scene we lead up to is awseome. Michael has been in a coma for 8 years since being burned alive in Halloween 2.

While being transferred in the ambulance to another facility from the mental ward Michael overhears 2 doctors talking about his only known living relative Jamie Lylod, played very well by Danielle Harris.  Jamie is now living with a family who adopted her.  We supposedly know what really happened to Laurie Strode but it doesn't explain in detail. Michael now is after to finish of his only known relative his neice.

Jamie starts to slowly see Michael in her imagination. Donald Pleasance is back to play Michael's psychiatrists and does a great job at it. Dr. Loomis comes face to face with Michael after Michael escapes and he accidently tracks him down, a very scary scene. Michael dodges Dr. Loomis's not very well aimed gunshots and drives to Haddonfield to look for Jamie. It never explains how Michael actually found her, coincidance maybe. He was looking for 8 year olds I assume. I am still not sure.  Michael is scarier than ever is this movie.

We lead up to a scene with Rachael and Jamie. Jamie and her stepsister Rachael go trick or treating after Racheal has to cancel a date with Brady and babysit her little stepsister. Rachael and Jamie get seperated and you see them looking for each other in a dark unlit town, pretty eerie. Dr. Loomis figures out that Jamie is Michael niece and eventually finds her and Rachael.  They go back to the sherriffs house and barricate the whole place to keep anyone from coming in.  This is when the movie starts to really grip you. Michael goes after Jamie and anyone that stands in his way. All the deaths scenes in this movie are very gory. There is a really scary rooftop scene and the special effects are great. Jamie gets separated from Rachael again and tries to hide in her  elementary school but she sets the alarm off when she goes in.  Racheal and Jamie soon reunite and try to leave town so the local sheriffs can finish off Michael. The ending is brillantly done and scare the wits out of me.

332015,3,630130053X,"I watched this film reluctantly on cable during a spree of similar films around Halloweentime. As a general rule, I've found that horror movies with Roman numerals after them increase in suckiness in proportion to how large the numeral is. In the case of ""IV"" this proved not to be true. This is a pretty good horror flick, much better than I expected and very professionally done.

OK, the film has a wee plothole or two...or three. I mean, at the end of Part II, Michael Myers took about a dozen bullets in the chest, had both of his eyes shot out, and was set on fire and burned into a giant s'more. He was about as dead as dead gets. His doctor, Loomis, also got BBQ'd. This film, opening ten years after the second, uses the soap opera tactic of simply re-writing its own past hisory. Turns out Michael was only badly burned and the fusilade of bullets he took in I & II missed every vital organ. His eyes regenerated too -- a wonderful thing, modern medicine! Anyway, Dr. Loomis also escaped without too much injury, just a limp and facial scars. Both of them continue to reside at the Pleasantview nut house, Michael as a comotose patient, Loomis as his obsessed shrink. Michael is supposedly comotose, but Loomis isn't fooled. He understands the big fella is just waiting for something to set him off....

The pretext of this rampage is Michael's discovery, through an indiscreet and therefore soon to be dead aylum orderly, that he has a living neice. Since Michael's mission in life is to kill all his female relatives -- we all need hobbies -- he makes bloody tracks for his former hometown of Haddonfield, with the relentless Loomis in pursuit. Unfortunately, the people of Haddonfield have mostly forgotten about Michael. And because Loomis, wonderfully played as always by the late great Donald Pleasance, often comes off as a paranoid nut case, his warnings aren't taken too seriously by the sheriff (horror movie sheriffs never listen!). Before you can say ""imaginative and unpleasant deaths for teenage horror-movie fodder"" Michael has trapped his neice, the sheriff, the extremely nubile sheriff's daughter, the extremely stupid sheriff's deputy, the heroine, and the heroine's cheatin' boyfriend, in a creepy house and cut the power, and proceeds to pare the group down using various handy household impliments.

This movie has numerous horror movie cliches: mysterious lights that shine through the trees....fog that looks suspiciously man made....a filling station in ""Illinois"" that appears to actually be in New Mexico...cops so stupid they could work for Chief Wiggum....a posse of vigilantes who can't shoot straight....teens whose combined brain power couldn't light up a GE Soft White....and, of course, a conveniently ambiguous ending. I have to say, however, that none of this really matters. The acting is surprisingly good, especially from the neice, the script is more than passable, and the creep factor is high. I was almost sorry to see Michael put on his trademark ""William Shatner"" mask (they really should STOP selling that in Haddonfield) because that creepy white plastic restraint mask he wears the first third of the film is even scarier. Michael's child-like body language after he kills someone is very disturbing -- that slow, wonderous tilt of the head (they could have used louder mouth-breathing through the mask, though). There is also a twisted touch in the relationship between Michael and Loomis -- Michael has many chances to kill Loomis and never goes for it, perhaps understanding that

Loomis is a necessary ingredient in the ""game"" they play together. And the film's end twist, minus the ""gee, too bad he fell down that abandoned mineshaft so we can't find his body"" is really disturbing.

H-4 is not a great horror film, but it is a respectable one. If you are fan of the Halloween franchise, or just of slasher films in general, but want something that looks more like a real movie and less than a college student film gone horribly wrong (I'm looking at you, Friday the 13th Part VIII) try this one.",1102204800,8,4059,4.911078717201166
332016,3,630130053X,"After taking a break from the Michael Myers theme with ""Halloween III."", the creators of the franchise wisely returned the series to its roots with the fourth installment. This time, Michael is stalking the daughter of his deceased sister on Halloween night. Donald Pleasance is also back and just as good as ever as Michael's nemesis, Doctor Sam Loomis. One of the better entries in the series gets a rather average DVD special edition with a pretty good featurette and not much of anything else.

332021,4,630130053X,"I liked this sequel better than any of the other movies with Myers in them.  Although it does suffer from some extremely lazy writing - how did Myers get in the house?  Why did the cops show up just in time? - those defects don't ruin what is essentially a good story.

A girl (Ellie Cornell) gets stuck babysitting her little foster-sister on Halloween night.  While they're out trick or treating, she runs into her boyfriend, who is cheating on her, and she loses track of her sister.  After a desperate search, Michael Myers starts lurking around, and some nice, suspenseful scenes follow.

Overall, the acting by Cornell is what drives this movie.  She plays her part extremely well.  The action moves along nicely - which is ten times more than I can say for the original Halloween.  So, you've got good characters, good suspense, and...what else more were we expecting?",1098921600,3,875,4.741721854304636

Not even 52 minutes had passed since the patient was loaded up and the ambulance on the road when suddenly the patient kills the male and female staff members inside.  It is Michael Myers!  The ambulance comes to a dead stop in front of the Carruthers house at 4:00am.  This little girl, Jamie (Danielle Harris) just happens to be looking out the window at the ambulance.  She has had insomnia for four straight nights.  That night and Halloween night, the girl is haunted by Michael Myers (who happens to be her uncle) who is back into his old neighborhood for more killings.

Michael Myers' motivation for stalking his niece is never revealed, and the ending leaves it open for yet another bad sequel. The best thing about this version is that we get to see Donald Pleasance again.",1093478400,,372,4.828125
332026,4,630130053X,"After the failure that was Halloween III and with John Carpenter completely removed from the project, the series and Michael get revived and the result is quite impressive.  Halloween 4 introduces a new group of characters that I found to be both interesting and charming enough that I must admit I was rooting for the good guys by the end of this movie!

Supposedly the ending of Halloween II is re-examined to prove that Laurie in fact died in the fire and that a burned Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) and of course an immortal Michael Meyers make it out of the fire.  Michael is heading back to Haddonfield, only this time he's after the final living relative, his 7-year-old niece Jamie (Danielle Harris).  Luckily for Jamie, she's got a strong half-sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) who isn't ready to see anything happen to Jamie.  When the killing starts in Haddonfield all over again it's up to Rachel to keep Jamie out of harm(Michael)'s way.  Can she keep Jamie safe or will Rachel just become another one of his many victims in order to kill his relatives.

This movie rehashed the series and gave it a much more modern twist.  It definitely upgraded to full blown ""slasher"" status and I'd even venture to say it's a ""splatter"" flick.  This movie had another decent body count as well as a healthy set of gore, while still managing to hold on to what made Halloween a classic.  Although the soundtrack is completely recycled at this point, but still effective, the use of noir and shadows is gone.  What still does remain is the on the edge of your seat suspense that the original two had, and they do it well.  I also like the fact that the Halloween series is almost a snotty version of a slasher film in that the body count doesn't have to be high and we almost expect the amount of blood and sex to be minimal, however I'm sure many will agree that the film still manages to remain just as scary if not more so than its competition franchises.

The DVD was quite impressive with the expectations set by the previous DVDs and the competition.  It gives us the film, clean and in widescreen, as well as giving us a surround sound track (modernize it a little).  What I liked was the documentary about the fourth movie and the rebirth of the Halloween series with this new ""small child"" dynamic.  I didn't know it was on the DVD when I purchased it, but knowing that it's on there explains the extra couple of bucks and is definitely worth it!  If you're a fan of the series, this is a must own.",1093305600,3,2495,4.484513274336283
332027,5,630130053X,"After watching all of the Halloween's on TV, I thought I would buy my favourite ones on DVD (being the original Halloween and Halloween 4). Although I found there were no special features, I thought the film was great.

Within 84 minutes you fear Michael Myers fighting his way through Haddonfield trying to kill as many people as possible using guns, thumbs and obviously his beloved knife. The person who seems to know Michael the best is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who carries on trying to defeat this evil mad man.

Halloween is one of the most influencial and well-known slasher film to date and this may be the most goriest and scariest yet.

PLOT: Similar to most of the other Halloween's. Michael Myers escapes from an ambulance and strikes Haddonfield for another Halloween event.

ACTING: The acting varies from OK to excellent showing the full potential of each character.

PICTURE: The quality of the picture is clear.

SOUND: Good sound quality for a 16-year-old film.

LENGTH: 84 mins - short.

GORE CONTENT: There is a fair amount of gore but it isn't too over-the-top.

MUSIC: The famous Halloween theme helps make the scary atmosphere.

TOTAL: 9/10. 4.5/5  Highly recommended!",1092355200,3,1196,4.93

332070,5,630130053X,"If you thought the nightmare was over- you were DEAD wrong. Michael Myers is alive and well, and coming back to Haddonfield in ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"", the fourth installment to the ""Halloween"" series and the third appearance of the sadistic Michael Myers. Without a doubt, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is the best ""Halloween"" sequel. It is just almost as good as the original in so many ways. ""Halloween 4"" sticks to a simple formula of the original but doesn't copy, it is well acted and direcred, and it is scary as they come. Halloween has returned to Haddonfield, and HE has come home... again.
First, ""Halloween 4"" stays with a simple, chilling story like the original ""Halloween"" but does not completely copy the film. It is hard for sequels to not stray too far from the series basics or not to just completely rewrite the original. Many series, such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"", and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" tend to get repetative with their many sequels. ""Halloween"" however finds something new to add into the mix. Here, in ""Halloween 4"", the babysitter's nightmare comes true again. It's been ten years since Michael Myers killed 16 people until finally being stopped by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Myers and Loomis were both burned nearly to death, but they both lived, with Loomis gaining a limp and Myers being put into a coma. In those ten years, Lourie Strode has died with her husband Jimmy (from ""Halloween II"") in a car accident and left their daughter, Jamie (Danielle Harris) behind. Jamie has just arrived in a foster family under the care of the Curruthers', with Rachel Curruthers (Ellie Cornell) as her foster sister. Jamie has lived in fear of her uncle Michael waking up, but she hasn't had to worry... until now. While being transported to a different hospital, Michael awakes from his coma and brutally escapes, heading back to Haddonfield. No believes Loomis (again) that Myers is alive and heading to Haddonfield, but they are proven wrong when he arrives there, on Halloween night, and goes after little Jamie, plus anyone who gets in his way. Now this may sound like the original a bit, but the difference comes when this time Haddonfield is prepared for Myers, and when Loomis comes and warns Sheriff Meeker (Beau Starr, who has replaced Charles Cyphers as the Sheriff of Haddonfield), Haddonfield citizens and police get ready, but how is anyone safe. Meanwhie, Rachel has been assigned to take Jamie trick-or-treating, and soon enough, she looses her. Different twist from ""Halloween"" when Michael stalked babysitters with their children.
Second, this film is great because of its acting. The original ""Halloween"" had excellent acting in it, creating very believable characters. The second ""Halloween"" had bad acting for the most (with the exception of Donald Pleasance, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Charles Cyphers). Here, we have some very talented young people. Donald Pleasance is of course great as Dr. Loomis who is now even more obsessed with killing Michael. Pleasance is convincing and great, and without him the ""Halloween"" series most likely wouldn't be what turned out to be. Joining the cast of the ""Halloween"" series is Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris, both young, aspiring stars. Cornell is a perfect cast for Rachel and she is both beautiful and gifted as an actress. Cornell can play the pissed girlfriend, the protective older sister, and the terrified damsil in distress all in this one movie. Harris makes herself a horror icon in this movie. I have never seen a child actor more convincing than Harris in this movie. She will have you fear for her and her character runs along the lines of 1978's Lourie. Beau Starr doesn't replace Charles Cyphers, but he does hold a candle on his own. He is a great Sheriff and a memorable one at that. Sasha Jensen plays Rache's boyfriend Brady, Kathleen Kinmont plays the cruel daughter of Sheriff Meeker, and George P. Wilbur plays the sadistic Michael Myers. This is a cast that could only be accompanied by Dwight H. Little for a director and Alan B. McElroy as the writer.
Thridly, this movie is scary. It is not disturbing or really gory, but like the first ""Halloween"", it is scary because it just is. Unlike the second, ""Halloween 4"" doesn't rely on gross out death scenes to get its point across. Yes, there are some 'creative' deaths, but none truly disgusting. There is very little blood shown and the amount of thrills shown takes care of the lack of gore. Michael is once again merciless. He goes from the hospital, to the ambulence, to the gas station, to the open road, to the electic company, to the town of Haddonfield, where he wreaks havoc on its citizens. The suspense builds to the climax where Michael is chasing his final victims while ontop a truck. Michael also continues to pop out at people and appear suddenly, making him once again just plain old creepy. A lot of times, by the fourth sequel in a series, the chills are worn out, but ""Halloween"" proves that theory wrong.
In conclusion, if you are going to buy any two ""Halloween"" movies, make sure its 1978's ""Halloween"" and 1988's ""Halloween 4: The Curse of Michael Myers"". Overall, ""Halloween 4"" is a sure thing for any thriller fan. It is scary, entertaining, well acted, well done, well written, and just well overall. Michael Myers returns with a bang, and the series isn't even close to being over. From its suspense driven opening to its shocking and horrifying climax, you wil be sure to scream!

First of all, the director Dwight H. Little knew, unlike most of the other directors that the original structure of the first film could not be bettered and for this reason he decided to loosely stick to the story whilst introducing some fresh new concepts and direction. Whats more interesting is that as the story is aimed at a more modern audience, Little  blends in the mythology and sinister take of the halloween season like in the original two whilst introducing a much more fast paced storyline that is much more action packed as well as bloodier, gorier and to a certain extent scarier with a few memorable shocks which  the other sequels (apart from part 2) failed to do. Ultimately, this is what makes halloween 4 a cut above the rest.
All in all it is a worthy sequel to the original which accepts that it is just a sequel and using this manages to breathe some fresh new life into the halloween franchise. A MUST SEE!!",1081814400,,1177,4.547169811320755

Then Michael kills her in the 6th one. I found it was weird that in Micheal Myers's hometown there are only two cops and they have to call for back up to save the town.

The only flaws with this film is that sometimes the plot is a little too slow, and that Michael Myers doesn't seem as scary as he did in the first two.

This entry is right up there with ""Halloween II"" in the greatest sequels of all time, perhaps even better than number two, but they're both so close, I don't try to pick.
Let me start off by saying how great the sets are on this film. The beginning main title sequence for this film has got to be my favorite in the whole series, showing the creepy outskirts of the town of Haddonfield with Halloween decorations around, and great music to go in with it. What a combo. This time Alan Howarth only returned for the music, John Carpenter done completely with the series.
But as I find myself watching this movie again, I want them to elaborate on those scenes even more, and the eerie feel continues throughout the entire movie, with more cool sets. They make up for the lack of philosophical quandaries that I enjoyed from the previous three entries. This movie loses a certain level of intellect the first three had, but is still very good and structured pretty well, if a little predictable at times.
But we get a great foreboding scene in which a reverend is giving Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) a ride.
""You can't kill damnation, mister. It don't die like a man dies.""

So what's the premise of this entry? Moustapha Akkad, the executive producer of all the Halloween movies felt it was time to go back to the Michael Myers storyline and the basics. Director Dwight H. Little and screenwriter, Alan B. McElroy discussed their idea for a Halloween film, and came up with ""The Return of Michael Myers.""
Taking place ten years after the events of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II,"" the film starts out with the killer, Michael Myers, lying in a coma, being transferred from one hospital to another. But a crack a paramedic makes about Myers having a niece living in his home town causes him to wake up get back up in working condition. But Donald Pleasance, is back again, playing Dr. Loomis, in another great acting job, following Michael's trails of carnage back to Haddonfield, where he teams up with the Sheriff to bring Mike's niece, 7-year-old Jamie Lloyd to safety. But that doesn't stop the elusive Michael Myers as he finds his way into a bolted up house and creates some more damage.
As said before, the atmosphere is terrific in the film, perhaps the best part of the whole movie. The acting is very good. Danielle Harris, making her film debut in ""Halloween 4"" delivers a wonderful acting job in her role of Jamie Lloyd, who is stalked relentlessly by Michael Myers.
The bottom line: recommended for the fan looking for a very faithful follow-up or just a fun-seeker out for a good popcorn night, but get ready to be chilled!",1072051200,,2817,4.611553784860558
332113,3,630130053X,"This movie came out in 1987 or '88 (I can't remember which), a time when the slasher genre was starting to die down - even the Jason films weren't grossing as much as they used to. So, it's rather odd that the producers would pick this as a time to resurrect Michael Myers.
As I said in the title of this review, this movie, like Halloween II, follows the slasher formula every step of the way, with gory kills, sex-crazed teenagers and people doing exceedingly moronic things - the rules of the horror genre that we all grew to know and (some of us) love during the '80s.
Considering that the original Halloween was built on suspense rather than splatter, this is actually a pretty decent sequel. It's better than Halloween II, at any rate. Sure, Michael is about as menacing as a ballpoint pen by now, but it's still a fairly entertaining entry in the series, and it's lightyears ahead of 5 and 6.

""Halloween IV"" used to be a favorite of mine growing up but as an adult, this movie just oozes cheese. It is a big guilty pleasure despite that the series has become a parody of the original slasher flick. Here the movie takes the viewer ten years (or so) forward since Jamie Lee Curtis' run in with the maniacal psycho killer Michael Myers. Michael has just woken up from a coma and escapes during a transport to another psychiatric hospital ward. He goes after his niece Jamie, played by Danielle Harris. She is living with her adopted family. Of course what is a Halloween movie without Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis. We obviously see now how hellbent Dr. Sam Loomis is on stopping Michael Myers. His sanity begins to crack slowly but surely throughout the fourth Halloween flick. Most of the acting is over the top and bordering on just bad albeit on the funny side though. Michael's mask is hideous. I thought it just looked bad. The actor playing Michael is as stiff as a cardboard when he pursues his victims. I love how Ellie Cornell's character Rachel manages to survive a fall off the roof and is able to walk that far to save her sister Jamie from that homocidal freak known as Michael Myers. Without ruining the ending, I thought the last scenes in the movie were really over the top and just straight out bad. Despite the fact that ""Halloween IV"" is terribly cheesy compared to its first two predecessors, it makes for a good 90 minute thrill ride. I can't say the same about the movies after ""Halloween IV"".",1067472000,,1682,4.554455445544554

Freddy was cool for about the first two movies then became a joke(You knew that when someone fell asleep..they were a goner.)Jason was stupid and gory. But nevertheless,they were money makers. So,it seemed only right to have Mikey make a return.

332120,3,630130053X,"Michael Meyers and Dr. Loomis were (presumably) blown to bits at the end of Halloween II.  Then in Halloween III Season of the Witch, they tried out a whole new story line with nothing at all to do with Michael Meyers and the first two films.  But nothing can stop financier Mustapha Akkad (the only person to be involved in every single Halloween film) from grinding out another dollar...
Using some (questionable) horror movie logic, turns out Michael Meyers and his obsessed doctor / hit man Sam Loomis actually survived that massive explosion and inferno at the end of II.  Meyers went into a coma and the good doctor suffered only some scarring.  Oh, and he needs a cane, too.
Ten years after the original nightmare, Meyers wakes up from his coma and escapes from the hospital.  (To prove he hasn't lost a step, he even pokes his thumb through some guy's skull!)  Once again, Meyers returns to Haddonfield and proves that he's the only horror movie icon who is also a skilled driver.  Can you imagine Pinhead or Freddy behind the wheel?
This time he's after his niece Jamie, the daughter of Jamie Lee Curtis' character from the first two films.  Turns out Laurie Strode died in a car accident (a convenient way of saying that Jamie Lee had had enough of horror films by 1988).  This gives Michael ample opportunity to dispatch a few Haddonfield residents, including a bloodthirsty lynch mob as well as a few hapless cops.  Michael does what he does best: walks slowly, uses a large kitchen knife, and wreaks havoc.
Something to keep in mind:
Halloween 4, 5, and 6 (The Curse of Michael Meyers) were basically disregarded by the producers of Halloween H20 and Resurrection.  They treated the three films like they never happened in order to resurrect the franchise.  Again.  So there are parallel universes or something like that happening across the Halloween series.
This is a pretty serviceable slasher movie in the end.  A major point of recommendation is, of course, Donald Pleasance.  He's got the raincoat, he's got a gun, and he's losing his mind in the hunt for Michael Meyers.  Don't miss a chance to hear him talk about ""evil on two legs"", trying to convince another sheriff that death has come to town.  Again.
Excellent score by frequent John Carpenter collaborator Alan Howarth.  This is not your typical Halloween score by a long shot.  The focus is on atmospherics, and the famous theme is rather subdued in favor of more subtle soundscapes.  Highly recommended disc.
Overall, I liked it.  I mean, it was inevitable.  There had been about five Friday the 13th sequels, four Nightmare on Elm Streets and two Hellraisers out in between Halloween II and 4.  Whose going to blame Akkad for cashing in?  All in all, they did a pretty capable job of updating the story and of killing off another cast of unwitting fools.
Best of all is Bucky the power station worker.

I'd have to say, Danielle and Ellie did a great job in Halloween 4.  It was suspensful, it was horrifying, it was scary, it is a classic.  I feel that this is the best out of the entire series because it had the best storyline and a great cast of characters.  Thumbs up to this thriller.  This fits nicely in with the storyline, because Michael believes that Laurie Strode was killed in a car crash and is now out to eliminate her daughter.  Donald Pleasence, the hero of the series, it at his best in this one, trying to prevent Michael from doing anymore harm in Haddonfield.

332166,1,630130053X,"It's frightening to think that if this movie was never made we would never have been subjected to the dreck that is Halloween 5, 6, 7 and 8. And the double shame is that even tho the story here is silly it is at least interesting. The continuation of this was the only decent thing about Halloween 5 and it may well have been good in 6 too but that movie was all rearranged and jumbled before it hit out screens.

So what we have here is a collection of dull murders with bad story continuity. H20 and Resurrection pretended that 4, 5 and 6 never happened. There is no REAL backbone or history to this series. All they represent is a producer who asks us to pay money for the same thing over and over. We cannot use photocopied money to pay for our tickets at the box office so the movie-makers owe us something new. And in Halloween 4 we don't get it. In fact I'm sure that to the untrained eye Halloween 4 and 5 could very well be the same movie.

And it is SO slow! Nothing really happens for about 70 minutes worth of the movies 88 minute running time. It leaves you begging for a Jason Voorhees style mass murder spree. That does not happen I'm sorry to say. The movie cuts away at the point of every death and when it doesn't the deaths are dull and boring. A man is thrown onto an electrical power grid and...sparks fly. That's it? How about his face melting or at least getting set on fire? Plus the body count is shockingly low. What is up with the thumb thru the head? Not only is it badly shot, too quick and just plain puzzling (surely a quick neck snap would be easier and nastier) the physical possibilities of it are equal hammering a tack into a concrete slab. It just can't happen. I don't care how superhuman Michael Myers unexplained powers are.

The whole 'motiveless psycho' may have worked well in Carpenter's original but here it's asking for money for old rope. Carpenter used it to great effect and scriptwriter Alan B. McElroy (responsible for some awesome Spawn episodes) uses it as an excuse for lazy, unimaginative writing. Though he has the scriptwriters strike to blame as he beat the deadline by mere hours. But even a few hours worth more imagination could have made this the tiniest bit better.

There's just not much for Myers to do. He comes out of a coma, goes back to Haddonfield and kills. For no reason. There are no sets other than houses and no opportunity for big excitement or set-pieces. I'm sorry but the 'famous' rooftop scene is boring, badly rehearsed and badly shot. Director Dwight H. Little (Marked For Death, Murder at 1600) even throws in a 10 second scene in an Elementary school for no reason. Plus the only shot of Michael in this scene shows him with WHITE hair on his mask. A pretty big goof, lookout for it.

Out of all the lessons in how to make an effective horror film that were were taught in the first film none of them are really echoed here. Slasher flicks by their very nature are low brow but Carpenter had a simplistic purity and charm that made it work. Plus he filmed the movie in anamorphic Panavision which instantly gives it some class. Plus he used the widescreen framing well. Dwight H. Little seems oblivious to this and instead uses standard 1.85:1 widescreen with no particular flare.

And I must mention the very poor dialogue. It offers no insight into the lives of the teenagers in the story or provides them with extra character. Why are we supposed to care when they get killed? It's obvious from the beginning that they are nothing but fodder for Michael Myers. And it's a crime that when they die it's not even graphic or ugly in the slightest, just boring and badly shot. It's not a horror film because nothing horrifies or upsets other than paying money to see it. Stay well away. Go watch a Friday the 13th movie and see the J-Man do his thang.

Anchor Bay presents this DVD in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen. The print is grainy and rather dirty. Nothing of reference quality. Sorry. There soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 from the original Ultra Stereo tracks. It's good enough. One hardly expects a sophisticated soundtrack from a film of this nature. In fact I prefer it to the obnoxiously loud sound designs of more recent slasher flicks.

A 16 minute documentary, offering new interesting insight to the movie, is included. The participants don't have much to say and seem to regard the film in a higher manner than it deserves.

On October 30,1988 Michael is to be transferred to Smith's Grove. On the ambulance one of the paramedics mentions Michael's niece Jamie (Danielle Harris)living in Haddonfield. The shape rises up and murders the passengers on board the ambulance. Early in the morning the police and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) search through the wreckage of the ambulance. When Dr. Loomis finds no sign of Myers he heads back to Haddonfield to search for his nemesis.
Meanwhile, back in Haddonfield we are introduced to the Carruthers, a good foster family who have adopted Jamie Lloyd after the death of her mother (Laurie Strode).On halloween night Jamie goes trick-or-treating and is unaware that the shape is after her. But a major obstacle stands in Michael's way, Jamie's foster sister Rachel(Ellie Cornell). This all leads to an exciting climax and a shocking ending.
  Halloween 4,in my opinion, is a great sequel in the series. In my opinion, Halloween 2 is the best sequel in the series. All the castmembers do a great a job with their roles. Donald Pleasence does another excellent job. Ellie Cornell makes a great heroine. And Danielle Harris is an extraordinary actress considering her age. Also George P. Wilbur makes a good Michael Myers.
The DVD is great too. It's presented in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. The picture is extremely clear. There is a Theatrical Trailer and a documentary Halloween 4: The Final Cut.
After I went on about how good the sequel is, there are some things that keep it from being the best sequel. First of all, the dialogue at times can be laughable. Although, the acting from the three leads is solid, the lines they have to say can be tiresome. In the documentary, Alan B. McElroy explains how he had 11 days to come up with a script and get it to the studio. Well, it kind of shows. But I don't blame him. Also, jumping from location to location does down some of the suspense. It jumps from seeing Jamie and Rachel trick-or-treating to the police station, to the sheriff's house, then the elementary school, then back to the Carruthers house. It gets kind of old and non-scary, because we kind of lost Michael in the process. In the original Halloween they stayed with one location and that made it scarier. This is,however, a very satisfying sequel.",1038787200,4,2451,4.889423076923077
332170,5,630130053X,"Halloween 4 is a terrific entry in the best slasher series of all time.  While it doesn't have quite the all-pervading atmosphere, suspense, and general gloom and doom of the incomparable original, it more than lives up to the Halloween tradition.  To me, the key to this movie's success is the acting talent of both Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) and young newcomer Danielle Harris (Michael's niece Jamey).  Disfigured from his encounter with Michael ten years earlier, Dr. Loomis strides through this movie as the avenging hero he is, having to convince foolish minds that Michael has returned home to wreak havoc yet again.  Of course, you can blame a couple of paramedics for tipping Michael off that he still has a living relative, namely his sister Laurie's little girl Jamie (Laurie has supposedly died in an accident a year earlier).  After Michael is transferred out from under Loomis' nose, he naturally escapes and begins leaving a trail of bodies on his way to Haddonfield.  Loomis is right behind him, intent on saving the little girl from her evil uncle.  The young Danielle Harris gives an incredible performance for someone so young, conveying emotion and fear quite convincingly. After this movie came out, I remember hearing some criticism of terrorizing such a young person in this type of horror atmosphere, and Harris spoke quite eloquently on the subject from her perspective.  She brings to this movie talent well beyond her years.
Surprisingly, this movie is not altogether that graphic.  We rarely get to see the actual coup de grace of each killing (and in a couple of cases we don't even see the actual murder), and even the remains of the slain never exhibit much blood loss.  Of course, Michael uses a variety of means (including his bare hands) to murder his victims here.  I for one missed the guy's trademark knifings.  He does get hold of a knife eventually, but, sadly, he doesn't get much of a chance to use it.  As for Michael himself, it is easy to see that the man behind the mask is not the original ""shape"" Nick Castle.  George P. Wilbur has a slightly different build, and he just doesn't have the malevolent presence Castle possessed.  He is strong in the category of standing still and watching from the shadows, but he is a little awkward in his movements and often seems to be patterning them on those of King Kong.
This movie has some really nice touches to it, several that strongly call to mind pivotal scenes from the original.  Another master stroke is the conclusion, which certainly surprised me when I first saw it.  Far too often a trite ending can ruin one's impression of an otherwise good horror movie, but Halloween 4 offers evidence of how much a terrific ending can increase one's enjoyment of an already satisfying experience.  By inserting a whole new chapter in the Michael Myers saga, Halloween 4 actually injected the series with newfound life (and blood); it certainly excited me as a fan, and that is something that most sequels of sequels simply do not do.",1035158400,33,3023,4.791907514450867

For me, this was the introduction of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis (though I have of course seen the previous films since).
This sequel is very close in plot to the original film it just has a bigger budget. Michael Myers has come back to Haddonfield, only instead of his sister, it's his niece (Danielle Harris) that he's after. And of course, several innocent teenagers get in his way.
 Donald Pleasance can do no wrong. Personally, I think with his death so should have come the death of this franchise. These movies are not the same since Pleasance passed. In this film, Pleasances character is more determined and crazed than he was in the first two films and the audience is better off for it.
 I can't praise Danielle Harris performance enough. She was only ten yesr old when she made this movie and she does a great job. Since, though, I haven't seen in her in hardly anything other than the URBAN LEGEND.

Halloween 3 was obviously not a true blue Halloween movie(at least not with the Michel Myers Halloween). Halloween 5 was dumb just because I feel it tried to hard to be good and turned out horrible. Halloween 4 made most of us think that Laurie Strode was dead and completely out of the picture and introduced us to new characters who were almost as likeable as the original. And then we had the two regulars, Micheal and Dr. Loomis. And it was basically the same as the first, Micheal has a never ending need to kill members of his family and kill anyone who gets in the way. And then as usual Dr. Loomis finds himself in desprate need to find Micheal and stop him. So when Micheal escapes while being moved from a hospital to another one he gets away. Dr. Loomis discovers Micheal was moved and on his way to Haddonfield he discovers the wreck of an ambulance, which of course was transporting Micheal and even worse is that his body is no where to be found. And as most people have guessed Micheal is on his way to Haddonfield to kill again. I don't wanna ruin the rest for those who haven't seen it but the rest is awesome. Halloween 4 is rated R for some language and violence. Now to rate the packaging and all.

A decade after his failed murder attempt on his stepsister, badly burned killer Michael Myers awakens from coma during transfer to another facility, having learned he has another surviving relative to go after - adorable ten-year-old Danielle Harris  -  who has been having horrible dreams of a Shadowman out to get her. Dr. Loomis, himself crippled after having subdued Michael on his last killer outing, single-mindedly sets himself out to track down and eliminate Myers, once and for all, before he can achieve his latest odious objective.
This is a beautifully photographed film, atmospherically rich in dark colors. The suspense is superb, enhanced by a slower approach and even generally slower and eerier music. Michael's new intended victim being a helpless little girl - and a very sweet one, at that - adds to the urgency and the terror. The cast are capable, and the juvenile padding is kept to a minimum.
As usual, Donald Pleasence is superb as Dr. Loomis, his own advancing years enhancing his performance as a progressively more enfeebled warrior for the good. He has some especially good scenes with Harris and with Michael, at one point heroically offering himself in place of any other victims Michael might claim, which is touchingly done.",1021852800,,1362,5.0488888888888885

However, Halloween 4 is a good sequel. It brings back ""The Main Man"" Michael Myers and his Doctor Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance).
Michael is back for more terror in Haddonfield. This time hunting down his niece. Michael is always an entertaining sight and a great killer. He's strong, silent and destructive. A plot?

332277,2,630130053X,"Alright, let me tell you that the makers of this film were out to make a buck and totally threw logic out the window when they cooked up the harebrained premise for this film.  Didn't they watch Part 2 closely enough?  Did they think we wouldn't remember how it ended?  They actually expect you to believe that Loomis and Michael survived that explosion!!  Did you see that explosion?  It's far fetched enough that Michael walks away from it immediately and walks a few feet!  You can tell that Carpenter wanted this story to be over with(he wasn't crazy about doing a part 2 in the first place.  He didn't even want to add the twist that Laurie was Michael's sister!  He thought THAT was taking it a bit too far!!).  At the end of 2 we see Michael lying motionless, burning to death.  We spend extra time on this shot so the audience will get it through their heads that this series is over.  Over! Done with! No more Michael Myers! He's dead!  Burned! End of story!  Now, ten years after the fact, we're supposed to believe he has been in a coma, and with the exception of a few burns on his hands, he's still in ship shape pretty much.  Not only are we supposed to swallow this crap, but we're also supposed to believe that Dr. Loomis has survived this as well!  He's more superhuman than Michael it seems!  Look at him, he survives with a burn scar on the right side of his face only!  Oh, I'm sorry, he has a burned hand too!  He didn't even walk out of the operating room after the explosion like Michael did!  I'm sorry I'm ramming this point into the ground, but it's precisely this point that makes Part 4 so dumb and unbelievable!  I can't accept anything that happens in this film based solely on this point which was made extremely clear in Part 2.  That's why Carpenter wanted a new direction in Part 3(which people seem to hate so much), to tell people that the Halloween series has to move on in a different direction.  People didn't want to accept this, so our crew of genius Hollywood screenwriters cook up this implausible resurrection tale.  Michael just happens to wake up after a ten year coma en route to Smith's Grove sanitarium(after conveniently hearing by a trusty paramedic that his niece lives in Haddonfield).  Naturally, he slaughters everyone in his path in order to get to her.  It's established early on that Jamie Lee Curtis' character has died 11 months earlier(in other words, we couldn't afford or trick Jamie Lee to be in this film.  So, lets kill her off!  Problem solved!), so the cat and mouse chase is with Michael and his niece.  Enter our limping, partially burned friend, Dr. Loomis(who as usual, does a great job with his character, considering the crappy script he's given) who shows up to convince everyone what's going on and help save the little girl.  The film relies on those wonderful slasher flick techniques that are in no way scary, but great if you want to heckle the film.  People doing really stupid things in life threatening situations.  Myers has no problem eliminating every obstacle in his path, but just can't seem to get his mitts on that slippery little kid.  Another plot point totally overlooked by the crafty film makers:  Before being set ablaze, didn't Laurie shoot out both of Michael's eyes?  How exactly is he finding his way around in this film?  I know Michael's one bad mutha, but regardless of how evil he is, eyes don't grow back.  But, this point is yet another one overlooked to make this film.  Myers' mask is really terrible looking in this one, it looks more along the lines of foam or something.  There's also some really bad dialogue in this one.  One of many examples: Bewildered bartender closes his store after calling the sheriff's office and getting no answer.  He storms outside exclaiming, ""Phone doesn't just ring at a police station!  No way!  No how!!""  It's pretty lame when you watch the movie and hear him say it.  Funny, too!  There are more examples of this, but you'll have to watch to hear them.  Plus, the ending of this movie will have you shaking your head in disappointment.  The ending is basically the same as Friday the 13th part 4(where you think the psycho torch will be passed to Corey Feldman's character for future installments) and F13PT5(where once again, you think the hockey mask will be passed to the Tommy Jarvis character, but never does).  All in all, I must admit this film is fun to watch strictly for the purpose of being in awe over the fact that someone actually OKed the project!",1004054400,5,4509,4.56359102244389

Michael Myers escapes from a mental institution and heads back to Haddonfield to track down his niece Jamie LLoyd, who is Laurie Strode's daughter. Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis. He is even better here than he was in the first two. He's more mad. More driven. Danielle Harris, as Jamie, is an extraordinary actress for her age. She is very, very believeable. You cry and root for her. She is very good. One of the best heroines in horror films in years. Michael himself is still quite scary. The mask is totally different. That's because he lost his old one in the fire. George Wilbur is a truly frightening image of Michael Myers. Ellie Cornell, as Rachel, is a beauty to look at. Her performance is routine, but good. Sasha Jenson, as Brady, is just there as eye candy for the girls. Nothing new. The film is sharp and tight, and has a great look and feel to it. The only thing that sort of ruined the mystique of Michael Myers was how he turned into a killing machine with some savage murders. Michael doesn't do that. They could've toned that part down.

332284,4,630130053X,"In the late 80's horror sequels flodded the market. With all the ""Friday The 13th"" movies comming out it was nice to see the return of the boogey man in Halloween 4. While Jason slices and dices without suspense, our man Mikey actually manages to scare us before he does it. The 4th part in the venerable ""Halloween"" series is not as good as the first 2 but comes pretty close.
The film completely ignores the debacle which was ""Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch"" and continues where H2 left off. Michael survived the fire and has been ina coma in an asylum ever since. I love how screen writers think up ways to negate the previous films endings. But in this film it actually works. Of course we all know Mikey wakes up to wreak some havoc. He returns to his stomping grounds ""Haddonfield"" to now chase after his neice, Jamie Lloyd, (Jamie being an homage to the absent Jamie Lee Curtis) finely played by the young Danielle Harris.
There are cool death scenes, like the one where Mikey impales Kathleen Kinmont onto a wall with a rifle. And great chase sequences, the trapped in the house sequence is a highlight.
What takes away from the film is the way nothing is explained fully, horror genre fans watch these movies and love to connect the dots. We don't know how Michael really knows Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is his neice. Also how did Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) die? There are some continuity problems too, e.g. the way Myers paleface mask seems to change from scene to scene. Also the film rehashes some of the originals scenes, like Jamie's scene where she is screaming down the street ""Somebody Help Me Please!"", the same way Laurie did in H1.
But the film has one key thing going for it, Michael Myers. He is one of the scariest Psycho's and it helps the film a great deal. The supporting performances by Ellie Cornell, and Donald Pleasance add to the whole mix. You actually believe that Ellie's character Rachael will risk her life to save her Foster- Sister Jamie.
If you can get over the minor mistakes and plotholes and take the film for what it is worth, you will enjoy this movie. This movie brings the series back to form, too bad the producers destroyed the momentum with the ending of Part 5 and all of Part 6.

I'm one of types of movie viewers who doesn't particularly like to see a child put in imminent danger, as is the case is virtually every chase and killing sequence in this film. Dwight H. Little, the director, doesn't help the process by helping newcomer Danielle Harris deliver one of the best little girl performances in the history of movies.

The character of Jamie Lloyd is equally distasteful. A snotty brat who gets teased by classmates. Myers still wears the same coveralls from part 2 and just happens to find his favorite mask in a dime store.

Whereas the character of Jason Vorhees may be taken directly from the character of Michael Myers, the series of Halloween movies was a copy of the Friday the 13th series. He's right that Halloween came out in 1978 and Friday the 13th didn't come out until 1980, but Friday the 13th Part 2 was released in May '81 and Halloween II was released later that year in October. Now, I ask you, who was copycatting whom? This extremely average installment in the Halloween series has good acting and good dialogue for the most part, but it just has too many unbelievable parts. There's only so far you can push your suspension of disbelief. And it's predictable!

The plot revolves around the fact that Michaels niece, Jamie, is being stalked by wicked psychopath Michael Myers.  Stemming from the 1978 hit, Halloween 4 in my opinion is an good sequale which I promise will scare you stiff.  Danielle Harris (Jamie) lights up the screen with her excellent acting along with Donald Pleasence (Sam Loomis)  The reason this didn't earn a 4 is because of the some what thin plot and mediocre acting by the supporting cast members.  Mostly hormone driven teens which you want to see die anyway.  The movie can be a bit slow at times also.  But that's kind of a contridiction due to the fact the original Halloween was slow and still was a great movie.  In conclusion, I recommend this to any hard core horror flick fans.

The only minor drawback is the featureless mask Michael is wearing, not nearly as scary looking as the one from 1 & 2.  All in all, this film is almost as suspenseful as the original Halloween.

332332,4,630130053X,"The essense of Halloween are decorations, jack-o-lanterns and spooky, eerie neighborhoods. That is what made the original Halloween such a classic. It scared the heck out of you because it was happening in a neighborhood that could very well be your own, and done so without special effects.
This spooky neighborhood concept was lost somewhat in No. 2 because of the hospital scenes, but it was recaptured brilliantly in No. 4.
The storyline is fairly solid, and the continuity of explaining the end of No. 2 and the beginning of No. 4 was well done. You know for sure that Michael must be pure evil to be able to survive two gunshots to the head and and become a human torch at the end of No. 2.
This is the only Halloween movie I saw at the theater, and there were many people in the audience who screamed out during intense moments.
The eerie neighborhood scenes that I love so much are wonderful here. Michael's shape moving in and out of the foggy, dark areas, trick-or-treaters being picked up by their parents after the power outage caused by Michael, the creepy shadows in the Meeker house as they make a stand, leaves blowing around in the streets and yards, dogs barking in the distance, and Michael striking at just the right moments are all the perfect ingredients for heart-pounding suspense. The scenes on top of the house as Jamie and Rachel try to escape from Michael's knife wielding have you on the edge of your seat!
The only constructive criticism I have that would have made the picture better is possibly a flashback scene showing Jamie Lee Curtis' character of Laurie Strode in a tender moment with Jamie, solidifying the family connection between II and IV, and then showing how Jamie's parents died. Of course, we learn in H20 that Laurie faked her own death to escape Michael's wrath. I think Jamie Lee Curtis would have consented to do such a scene even if she didn't want to be featured throughout the entire movie.

It relied  on atmosphere and tension to attack it's audience. It wasn't an excuse for  nudity and mindless bloodletting. It was a serious film that didn't  downplay itself. It also didn't treat it's audience as if they had the IQs  of dogs. Director Dwight Little and writer Alan McElroy have taken that  exact same approach with the fourth installment in the classic horror  franchise, creating a film so intense you may just have to change underwear  during the third reel. Danielle Harris gives an amazing performance as  Michael Myers' young niece Jamie Lloyd who, along with her adopted sister  Rachel (also very well acted by Ellie Cornell) find themselves stalked by  the unstoppable killer during a power outage.

Michael Myers, after having burned in the ending of Halloween 2, is now in  a coma and being moved to another facility.  On the way, some people on the  ambulance start talking about Michael Myers' niece, Jamie (figures that she  is named after Jamie Lee Curtis) and the dormant assasin once again  revives.  As a little thank-you-for-you-assistance, he kills everyone in  the ambulance and dumps it in a murky lake.
Then, we see Jamie, who is  living in a foster home.  After a short brawl with her sister, she goes to  her bedroom, where she encounters Michael Myers in a nightmare (that really  freaked me out).
Dr. Loomis, heavily burned and injured after his last  encounter with Michael, shows himself as an obsessed hero, he still pursues  his idea that Michael is alive and that he must kill him, although everyone  thinks that Michael is dead.  But then again, when you think about it, if  Loomis isn't dead, who wouldn't guess that maybe Michael was still  alive.
The most frighting images of the movie come in the central point.  Michael is wearing several bandages on his face which give him a mysterious  appearance as a looks down on his next victim,a car repair man, and murders  him.  Then, when Loomis comes to the deserted repair shop and starts  looking around, you feel as if Michael is lurking by, ready to pounce, but  that isn't what happens.

Still though, John Carpenter  manages to pull it off again after a terrible Halloween 3:Season Of The  Witch. (which had nothing earthly to do with Michael Myers by the way)",947808000,,951,4.601190476190476
332481,5,630130053X,"H4 surprised me. It is a very well written horror movie, continuing the Michael Myers story. 10 years later, Michael and Dr. Loomis have survived, and Michael is back in Haddonfield, trying to kill Laurie Strode's  daughter, Jamie. Although Jamie Lee Curtis is not in this one, the dark  atmosphere and new set of characters make the movie very good.",946771200,,350,4.816666666666666
332482,2,630130053X,"Ten years later after the first massacre, Michael Myers who was presumed dead by most after getting crisped in a oxygen tank explosion escapes from a mental hospital and goes after his niece Jamie Loyd (Harris).

332483,4,630130053X,"""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is actually quite a good continuation, despite what some people say about sequels. It picks up  10 years after ""Halloween II"" ended. Michael Myers ends up in a  coma after being blown up in the operating room in II. He awakens when  being transferred to another hospital after he overhears he has a niece in  Haddonfield, Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode, who is dead (or so  we thought). He ends up traveling to Haddonfield and here we are treated to  what made the original such a success. Less blood, more suspense, tight  scenes and a dark atmosphere are all prevalent in this entry. Dr. Loomis  (Donald Pleasence) is now scarred and crippled after also being blown up  with Myers, and he teams up with Sheriff Meeker (Beau Starr) to stop what  could be a repeat of what happened 10 years before that. With Jamie Lee  Curtis absent, the ""scream queen"" duties fall to Ellie Cornell as  Rachel, Jamie's step-sister. She does a terrific job and she has some great  lines in this one. The ending is definitely the best of the whole series,  and it still gives me the creeps to this very day. Rent Halloween 4 for a  good scare.",941155200,7,1180,4.552380952380952
332484,5,630130053X,"In the age of teeni-bopper horror films, it's easy to see how Halloween 4 often goes under appreciated.  It doesn't have the hip young faces of H2O, and it was made 11 years ago, which is enough to turn most teenage viewers  off these days.  But to the real Halloween fan, The Return of Michael Myers  stands out easily as the best sequel in the series.  It retains suspense  and sheer thrills instead of abandoning them for gore like the misguided  Halloween II (which was good in its own right), and concentrates on pure  atmosphere and suspense playing out like a true homage to Carpenter's  original masterpiece.  Halloween 4 was shot beautifully, and this DVD truly  helps to unlock that aspect for real fans too young to see the film in  theatres.  The opening scene is filled with bright, changing colors  reminding one of Argento's Suspiria, and the shots of Haddonield during the  fall are beautiful and professional capturing the essence of fall.  The  acting is good, the story first rate for a third sequel.  Pleasance is  superb as the obsessed Loomis and George Wilbur plays a fine Michael.  All  in all, Halloween 4 is a perfect sequel, that expands on Carpenter's  original premise but at the same time carries out its task with an obvious  great respect for the original.",940032000,,1288,4.728506787330317
332485,4,630130053X,"Halloween 4 was a good movie considering it was made ten years after the original.  In this movie, we see Laurie Strode's daughter Jamie Lloyd for the first time.  Apparently, Laurie had died in a car accident, in H20 we  find out that Laurie had actually faked her death to hide from her  psychotic big brother.  When Michael escapes while being transferred to  another psychiatric hospital, he decides to search out his one and only  living relative in young Jamie Lloyd.  Donald Pleasence is great in this  movie as we see that he too survived the explosion at the end of Halloween  2.  Since Dr. Loomis is the only man who truly knows what Michael Myers can  do, he is the only hope for Jamie Lloyd.  In a movie that is criticized for  being just another bad sequel or another bad slasher flick, it is not that  bad at all.  The acting is not as bad as in Halloween 5.  There are no  exploding heads like in Halloween 6.  There is no Michael Myers who walks  like he has something shoved up in an interesting place like in H20.  Most  importantly, there are no evil Irish mask makers like in Halloween 3.  If  you are a Michael Myers fan, you will truly enjoy this movie.",939772800,,1175,4.358139534883721

Danielle Harris is so great of an actress.  I give her five  stars by herself. Donald Pleasance was also great in this movie.

However I am very confused in the last Halloween  H2O.  It never says that Laurie Strode had a daughter, but she does have a  son, John.  And why did she give her daughter away and stage her death?  Well, the staging of her death I understand, but why did she give up her  daughter and why was it never mentioned in the last sequel?  If anyone  knows, please, please let me know.

332498,3,630130053X,"The first ""Halloween"" is a seminal event in horror films.  It started the slasher genre.  While ""Halloween 4"" does not measure up to the original, or to the high production values of ""Halloween  H20"", it is the best of the ""second series"", the three films  of lesser quality produced between 1988 and 1995.  Halloween 4 is  entertaining and returns Michael Myers to his post as the king of the movie  slashers: a superhuman engine of destruction nearly unstoppable by his  all-too-human opponents.  What few realize is there there is a story to the  Halloween films, as the viewer tries to figure out Michael and why he does  what he does.  Unlike a lot of slasher films (Friday the 13th, etc), the  Halloween films are just as much mystery or suspense as horror.  Halloween  4 is not the film to jump into the series with, but for fans of Michael  Myers, who want to see him at his best with a minium of backstory,  Halloween 4 is hard to beat.  It is a key brick in Michael Myers' legend,  even though the film makes little sense and has little appeal out of the  context of the ongoing series.",925430400,,1096,4.467005076142132
332499,4,630130053X,"Even though it is not explained how Michael Myers (aka 'the Shape') managed to survive his collapse in the fire at the hospital in ""Halloween II"", this, the third sequel and third escapade of  Myers really delivers the goods.  The plot: The 'invalid' Michael Myers is  due to be moved from one mental institute to another - Smith's Grove (where  he escaped from in 1978). On the transportation ambulance, Myers springs to  life, killing both the doctors and drivers on board the ambulance. He  escapes, and returns to his old home... Haddonfield. Michael Myers' seven  year-old niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris) lives with foster parents in  Haddonfield, and is totally unaware of her uncle's hideous identity. Dr.  Sam Loomis (Donal Pleasance), Michael's old nemesis returns to track down  his 'patient', who is once again roaming the streets of Haddonfield... on  October 31.  To see what happens, watch the rest yourself, and its  excellent follow-up ""Halloween 5: the Revenge of Michael  Myers""... it's a shocker! If you're a fan of the 'Halloween' series,  or of plain HORROR itself, buy ""Halloween 4: the Return of Michael  Myers"". (P.S. I am British, and was lucky to be able to buy an old  ex-rental copy from 1990. If you live in the UK, sorry, but it's been  deleted.

7812021,4,630130053X,"Probably a good 3 1/2 stars. A solid, better than expected sequel to one of the landmark films in the horror genre. Unfortunately, Halloween 4 came out after the misfire of Halloween 3 and the disappointment of Halloween 2. It's not as good as John Carpenter's first Halloween, but at least the film attempts to emulate the artistry of the original. Unlike most other mid-series horror sequels from the 80's, the director, Dwight H. Little, takes his time to set up the atmosphere and build the tension. He goes back to the basics with several lingering shots of Michael's face in the background, stalking his victims, and a wonderful use of stillness and silence. And the opening credits are some of my favorite shots in the whole franchise, underscored by a wonderfully ominous sound design.

Donald Pleasance returns with another delightfully wacky performance--he's obviously having a blast in this film and plays up the melodrama to great effect. The other actors, including Danielle Harris, all give adequate performances with enough heart to be more than simply bodies to add to the death count.

Halloween 4 is by far the best of the Halloween sequels and worthy of consideration in the discussion of the best horror sequels of all time.",1512000000,,1245,4.952153110047847
