I am so glad I watched it, of course this is always a difficult and emotional subject to watch, but it is a time period we all need to know as much as possible about. Actors were superb!

7067196,5,B00UQW1I4E,"It is difficulty to say anything negative about this film--it is a 10 star portrayal of the conflicts encountered by residents of occupied Holland during WW2. So many life lessons are there.  However, in this 2015 film, what have be gained from our knowledge of human conflicts of this type?  We are still engaged, I would say regressively, in a period of time that is degenerating into tribal conflicts that were supposed to be eradicated by nation-states.  But we know since the story of Lt. Co. T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) that uniting tribes in their self-interest is a transient phenomenon, and as for liberty, well, those who told us it must be fought for in every generation were right.  I don't think it is a stretch to take this filme to be representative of problems of the 21st century, in fact, the lessons are even more poignant.  One could meet a Tamar (Maartje, young Amsterdam Jewess) in 1943 on a farm in a village and think she belonged there, but today, an American boy of German descent  will not meet a young Muslim girl in Detroit and mistake her for who she is--and for this, we will pay a great price, because the humanity that is engendered in our childhood experiences post-Renaissance are not possible to have in a pre-Renaissance, pre-Feudal tribal-nomadic human lifestyle.  If I'm wrong,
I pray that I see that I see the way out of these dead ends.  I do enjoy these films for I'm close tot he experience, on the other hand, I don't see the answers in them--only that for some of us, there emerges a kind of humanity that allowed the German soldier to overlook Tuur's ""theft"" of his aunt's cat and some wurst in a very human, young man's way--he was surely no Nazi as we stereotype them, although it appears that the Germans In that village were all SS.  In 1943, they should all have been fanatical.  Fanaticism answers nothing, although Christianity's reformation eschewed violence, which the ""reformation"" of other political-ideological movements appears to have gone the other way.  The question is, why?",1498953600,,2044,4.762039660056657

I am also a world war II movie fan and through the eyes of pre-adolescents, this one is no less dramatic. akin to ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas.""  I was soon engrossed in the story and touched by its profound and subtle messages.

The song sung during the credits at the end of the movie was an additional treat.  Go back and listen to it if you haven't done so already.  I don't know what the words mean, but the melody is beautifully performed by an unknown artist with a wonderful voice.",1497830400,4,664,4.584745762711864

It's a gripping story, and a fascinating look at life in a Dutch village during the Nazi occupation.

7067205,5,B00UQW1I4E,"This movie is absolutely fantastic and eminently worthy of 5 stars - in fact had it been out if 10, it would warrant a 10! It was powerful, emotional and beautifully crafted. Set in Nazi occupied Holland in 1943, it covers a number of explosive war related issues such as collaboration, the Holocaust and the Resistance through the eyes of children coming of age. Whilst it magnificently covers some age old themes such as friendship, loyalty and first love, what makes this movie is the simply stunning, world-class acting performances by the three child actors with a standout performance by Maas Bronkhuyzen as Tuur Ramakers. The movie begins gently with the carefree innocent world of two 12 year old boys. As often happens in early adolescence, the simple world of childhood now takes on more complexity as things once accepted are now questioned. This complexity is made massively more complicated by the pressures brought on by the presence of German occupiers in a small Dutch village. Imagine two boys, who are inseparably close friends, gradually come to realize that one's father (Lambert) is the most prominent Nazi sympathizer in the village and is rewarded as such publicly by the Germans and the other (Tuur), after sneakily following his father and brother, realizes that his family are part of the Dutch resistance. Into that already complex matrix enters an engaging Jewish girl renamed Maartje to hide her true identity after her parents were already deported to a concentration camp. In sharing their mutually explosive secrets, Tuur and Maartje add first love to an already complex situation. Lambert, having first had a crush on Maartje, reacts with understandable jealous anger. What unfolds is gripping, powerful and at times tear jerking story line that makes this movie to me, an aficionado of war movies, one of the most compelling movies ever made about World War 2. The child actors are so expressive and so engrossed in the emerging complexity of their roles that at times the sub titles are just not needed so compelling are their performances. Director Denis Bots sought to tell the story of the occupation before the generation that lived through it are gone forever. He has given us an Oscar worthy production with Oscar worthy acting.",1473811200,,2269,5.021220159151194

7067207,5,B00UQW1I4E,"Imagine you are a boy about 12 or 13 and your very best friend is also your age. There is a war going on involving the Nazis and they are in your neighborhood. So many things are going on but yet your parents refused to talk. So in your naive way you decide to find answers to all your questions. You now learned your father and older brother is a part of a resistance movement. Your best friend's father is a Nazi collaborator and he is trying to get his son to join the Hitler Youth Storm movement.. And to make matters worse a new girl arrived in town and both you and your best friend has taken a special interest in her, but being leery of your best friend's connection to the Nazis this girl felt compelled to share with you and only you a very personal secret. Meanwhile the Nazis has just completed a pig roundup and because of the jealousy the best friend had and by spying on his friend spotted a pig that was hidden from the Nazis, which was quickly reported to his father.

Unfortunately the best friend did not realized the mess he has created which created some very suspenseful moments in the film. The new girl was taken away; his friend's attempts to rescue her got arrested and put in jail only temporarily; the Nazis decided to do a complete cleanup of the community getting rid of everybody whom they felt was against their cause; and the best friendship you ever had was about to end. Fortunately, through some very tough reconciliation and apologies and some help from your best friend you and your family were able to escape the atrocities of Nazism.

The film was indeed very suspenseful; you just did not know what was going to happen next made more mysterious by the Nazis taking away some of the most prominent citizens of the community like the pastor. The director did an excellent job in giving us another example of the Nazis inhumanity to man; an extremely well done film.",1464998400,,1904,4.45272206303725

7067209,5,B00UQW1I4E,"This DVD about the Resistance and Collaborators in the Netherlands is five stars both in the story as told by the Dutch themselves and the actors.  Three young actors, Mass Bronkhuyzen as Tuur, Pipa Allen as Maartje, and Joes Brauers as Lambert were outstanding in their portrayals of young Dutch students who were starting puberty during the Summer of 1943 in a tranquil Dutch village during the occupation by the Nazi Army.  At first it was a war that was far removed from their daily lives.  Tuur and Lambert played Soldier, had their own juvenile hiding places in the woods and tried to live day to day despite the gradual encroachment of the Nazi occupation forces.  When Maartje arrived to lived with a family, with Tuur and Lambert she forged an instant bonding and the three became inseparable.  Tuur does not know that members of his family sneak out at night and participate in the Resistance.  Lambert's Father, a Nazi sympathizer, is appointed Mayor by the Gestapo, and instantly he and Tuur are at odds.  Tuur's family and neighbors are starving because all the livestock and produce are confiscated for the German Army.  Lambert's Brother has joined the Hitler Jugend.  Then Marrtje's secret is exposed that she is a young Jew living under an alias and taken to the prison in Maastricht!  But Lambert helped Tuur and his family escape into Belgium!  Here is a DVD movie told by the Dutch and produced in the Netherlands and Belgium that speaks for itself, and belongs next to Schindler's List, and Asa Butterfield in ""The Boy in Stripped Pajamas.""  Indeed, the ""Secrets of War"" revealed tragedies with no happy endings with the exception of survival.  The Producers provided multiple lessons of great value to be remembered in the new millennium.",1462924800,11,1760,4.865771812080537

7067214,4,B00UQW1I4E,"Oorlogsgeheimen (Secrets of War) is a film from the Netherlands and so the sound track is in Dutch, but it has English (and Dutch) subtitles.  The film is of excellent quality and the story is very well written.  It depicts the German occupation of a small town during the second world war as experienced by two twelve year old boys.  The boys were the very best of friends although one boy's father was a German sympathizer and the other boy's father secretly worked for the resistance.  Add in a girl that both boys care about who has a dangerous secret of her own and the tension between the boys becomes very great.  The resolution of this film is very poignant.",1458777600,,666,4.516666666666667
7067215,5,B00UQW1I4E,"I streamed this via Netflix. SECRETS OF WAR is a 20144 Dutch film about the Holocaust as seen through the eyes of children. It is rather unique among Holocaust films in that the violence is almost non-existent, and even the horrors that we have come to associate with the Holocaust is alluded to via clever filmmaking techniques. The film is set sometime during the war, perhaps around 1943, in the Dutch town of Limburg which borders French-speaking Belgium. Two 12-year-old boys, dark-haired Tuur (Mass Bronkhuyzen) and blonde Lambert (Joes Brauers) are the best of friends and enjoy all the exploits that young boys of their age indulge in. Then a new girl comes to school in the form of dark-haired Maartje (Pippa Allen), who is living with the Hoffmann's, who she says are relatives. The boys accept her into their circle and the three become fast friends.

However, all is not as bucolic as it may appear - the lovely countryside belies the fact that the Nazis are very much present and are the occupiers. Lambert's older brother is part of the Hitler Youth, his father is elected mayor of the Limburg due to his Nazi connections, and this places Tuur in a quandary. Tuur's family is anti-Nazi and involved in the resistance, and Lambert's father is a Nazi sympathizer and collaborator, which eventually places the boys at odds with each other. When Maartje reveals a secret to Tuur, the two get closer and this eventually sets events spiraling out of control.

The three young actors playing the lead roles do a commendable job of portraying the innocence of childhood even though all three find themselves growing up amid the harsh reality of war. Both my 11-year-old and I found this an insightful and engaging film.",1458432000,3,1725,4.824324324324325

7067218,4,B00UQW1I4E,"Director Dennis Bot shapes this excellent film by screenwriter Karin van Holst Pellekaan based on the novel by Jacques Vriens and accomplishes what few films have been able to do  relate the impact of war on children in a way that alters their perception of the world at the time of war and afterwards.

The story occurs in the summer of 1943. Tuur and Lambert are best friends. The surrounding of their idyllic village has no secrets for the teenagers. From the farm of Lamberts dad to the marl caves in the woods - it's their world. But the war is closing in and is about to change their lives forever. Tuur's dad joined the resistance and even his big brother seems to be a part of it. Lambert's family on the other hand choose to obey the Germans. Then a new girl from the city shows up, befriending the boys but telling her secret to only one of them. A choice that separates the boys and ultimately gets her in trouble. Tuur not only risks losing his friendship with Lambert, but even his whole family. He will have to stop at nothing to safeguard both.

Beautifully scored and photographed and blessed with a gifted cast, this little film leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. Highly Recommended. In Dutch with English subtitles. Grady Harp, February 16",1456272000,7,1262,4.5506607929515415

A Jewish girl in hiding during the war would never have revealed her Jewish identity to a non-Jew unnecessarily. The Nazis were relentless in hunting the Jews in the remotest, most desolate, parts of their domain; committing massive resources to the hunt; including rewards to informers. The Germans were constantly improving their tactics. Thus, Jews in hiding lived in constant fear. Jewish children were taught by their parents that they could tell no one of their identity, because that person might slip or tell one other person, who was not who they thought they were. A Jewish girl would have kept pictures of her family better hidden, which if found by the Nazis would not have been certain proof. A Jewish girl would not have kept an incriminating Jewish insignia like the cloth, gold-colored, star worn on clothing, unless she was going in and out of the ghetto, which this girl was not.

Far better Holocaust movies in order of interest are: ""Walking with the Enemy"", ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"", ""The Zookeeper's Wife"", ""Suskind"", ""The Couple"", ""The Statement"", ""The Grey Zone"", ""Spring 1941"".",1522454400,,1377,4.931034482758621

The 3 young leads were well cast, believable and did provide a very bitter-sweet twist to the story.

Tuur seemed to have a pretty bad family for the siblings to be so hostile in the midst of war, but he was utterly unsympathetic as a character despite this. He was almost laughably irritating from the outset, and never improved: petulant, whining, scornful without any apparent reason...and the movie isn't good enough to overcome such a basic problem as the main characters being so unlikable.
