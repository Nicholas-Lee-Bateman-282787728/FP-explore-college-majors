8031713,3,B0002TT032,"NIGHT CORRIDOR
[Yao Ye Hui Lang]

(Hong Kong - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Now firmly established as a popular figure in both the commercial and art-house sectors of Hong Kong cinema, hot young actor Daniel Wu Yin-cho (BISHONEN, ENTER THE PHOENIX) co-produced this eerie supernatural drama with Stanley Kwan Kam-pang - director of ROUGE (1988) and LAN YU (2001) - which Wu has described in interviews as: ""A dark, non-typical Hong Kong story, with a more European feel to it than most"". Based on a novel by writer-director Julian Lee Chi-chiu, Wu plays Sam, a photographer pursuing a successful career in London, far away from the ghosts of his childhood in HK, where he suffered years of sexual abuse at the hands of a 'benign' family priest (Eddy Ko Hung). However, he's forced to return home when his alcoholic mother (Kara Hui Ying-hung) informs him that his twin brother Ah-hung has died following a horrific incident in which he was torn apart by monkeys (talk about creepy!). Beset by grief and confusion, Sam seeks answers from the ageing night porter (Ku Feng) of a local library which his brother used to attend, where he's introduced to Ah-hung's strange girlfriend (mainland model Coco Chiang Yi) whose devotion to Sam isn't as innocent as it first appears. But Sam's return to HK has also rekindled his affections for a childhood friend (Allan Wu), whom Ko accuses of being partly responsible for Ah-hung's death. The mystery continues to deepen...

Filmed in twelve days on a limited budget and photographed with noir-ish intensity by debut cinematographers Wong Chi-ming and Charlie Lam Chi-kin, this multilayered shocker recalls the escalating paranoia suffered by Mia Farrow in ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), though the Gothic tone and slow-burning tempo of Lee's film owes as much to similarly-styled Asian entries like RING (1998) and JU-ON: THE GRUDGE (2003). Lee maintains a cohesive narrative structure, despite his fractured editing style and non-linear approach to the material, whilst Wu anchors proceedings with his skillful portrait of a sensitive artist cast adrift in a threatening landscape.

Many of the film's themes and images are linked explicitly to the famous painting 'The Nightmare' by 18th-19th century artist Henry Fuseli (that's the one in which a horned demon is sitting astride a sleeping/swooning woman draped across a bed), an image whose relevance only becomes clearer as the movie draws to its enigmatic conclusion, and while the stark location photography evokes an appropriate measure of creeping dread, Lee further unnerves his audience by introducing odd, disconcerting noises into an otherwise benign soundtrack, while half-seen images flicker briefly at the edges of the frame. Though it plays like a character study, the film is intensely cinematic in the usual HK manner, and while the ending is a little abrupt and confusing, events become clearer on subsequent viewings. Like BLOW-UP (1966), this is a movie which refuses to indulge the viewer's expectations...

Daniel Wu is in every scene, and he's hypnotic and beautiful and deeply tragic, all at the same time; tormented by the shadows of an unhappy childhood, and consumed by the darker shadows of an impending catastrophe, he tempers the anguish of his brother's death with the fortitude of a natural survivor. Chiang essays a character not unlike the nightmarish Sadako in the Japanese ""Ring"" series, an innocent-looking pawn of satanic forces, while Ku's kindly night porter turns out to be harboring more than a few guilty secrets of his own (my lips are sealed). Slow-going, but bewitching and dreamlike in the best possible way, the movie was given a Category III (adults only) rating by HK censors for some frank sexual material, including an extraordinary scene in which Sam sprawls beneath his bedclothes, masturbating langurously over a recent photograph of the young man he once loved and lost (now a hunky radio DJ). Few actors of Wu's standing have ever been so daring in HK cinema.",1255564800,,4029,5.152905198776758
8031714,3,B0002TT032,"Handsome and talented Daniel Wu, too often wasted in second-rate films aimed at his teenage fans, stars as Sam, an up and coming London photographer.  On the eve of his success, he learns that his twin brother, Ah Hung, has died.  Sam returns to Hong Kong and is confronted by ghosts of his past at every turn.

His new stepfather is a brutish, hirsute cretin whose one quality is sexual power (there's way too much information on that score) over Sam's mother.  She is barking mad, and a raging alcoholic.  Sam feels unwelcome, alone, and angry -- especially since everyone thinks he is dead:  Ah Hung was using his identity for some unexplained reason. Sam is befriended by an ominous librarian, and his ghostly daughter who says she was Ah Hung's girlfriend.  She now sets her sights on Sam.

Sam is also dealing with childhood sexual abuse by his parish priest.  The counterfeit clergyman is now attempting to cover up the past but is being blackmailed by Vincent (hunky Allan Wu), a well-known and well-built local DJ.  Vincent was the love of Sam's life, quite understandable considering his magnificent muscles, but he never answered the lonely younger man's letters and urgent requests to join him in London.

There is some stylish photography and attempts at atmosphere -- if simply shooting everything in darkness constitutes atmosphere -- but there are too many missed opportunities to make this the compelling film it should have been.  Alas, Mr. Wu is wasted here, too.

The plot is overly complicated for a 73 minute venue.  In fact, it is downright indecipherable:  Mr. Wu plays both brothers wearing the same clothes and, in confusing flashbacks, the viewer frequently cannot tell which one he is supposed to be.  Credulity further deteriorates as a result of non-sensical subtitles.

Daniel and Allan Wu are both beautiful and profoundly sexy, so one wants to understand what is going on, but the film ultimately sinks under the weight of its own pretentions.",1190851200,,1976,4.921450151057402
8031715,1,B0002TT032,"OK...i enjoy asian cinema (especially horror) as many do these days, and was looking to branch out from those well known titles (suicide circle, the eye, ringu, audition...)  the descriptions i saw for this title talked of a man living in london who has a twin brother in hong kong.  this twin brother mysteriously dies.  the man goes back to hong kong to find that his brother was using his identity.  yes, this happens...but the descriptions don't include the fact that the ""horror"" aspect here relies on the catholic belief system.  this one fact makes me think, ""if i want a horror about catholic beliefs, there are plenty of american classics to choose from...""  i won't include other spoiler details, but be aware that this title also has more in-your-face sexual content than any other asian cinema title i own...probably more than all of them put together.  I also thought the ""main"" plot was hard to follow because there are several ""sub-plots"" that take center stage far too well.  basically, i thought this had a concept that held great promise, but didn't deliver half of its potential.  (i say this is only for the super asian cinema fan who wants to see it all.)",1135123200,,1176,4.7254901960784315
