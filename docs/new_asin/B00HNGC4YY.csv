6185063,4,B00HNGC4YY,"Dead Shadows impressed me. Film-maker David Cholewa offers horror-action fans a film both fantastic and humanistic. The gore and other special effects are memorable and original. The characters and dialogue are unusually relatable and realistic. The performances are solid.  As masterfully as Alyson Hannigan on Buffy, Fabian Wolfrom captures the everyman nerd realistically. Dead Shadows target viewers are going to connect with Wolfrom's Chris. They _are_ Chris. Along with Wolfrom, John Fallon gives an excellent performance in a supporting role. Compliments to screenwriter Vincent Jule and the cast. I admired greatly how Dead Shadows homages a hundred and one different '80s films but still manages to present something new.

I recommend Dead Shadows. I had a great time with it.",1402531200,,785,5.533333333333333
6185064,3,B00HNGC4YY,"this movie felt a little claustrophobic to me, the main character, Chris, played by Fabian Wolfrom, his eyes are seriously mesmerizing, is in a dinky apartment with the typical cast of characters surrounding him. The neighborhood bullies, the femme fatale across the hall and the hard and tough guy that winds up helping. Another end of the world apocalypse by the French. Nothing new or special but if you want to kill some time...keep the sub-titles...the voices used in the dubbing and the dubbing....bad. I would really go 2 and a half stars but......",1401840000,,555,4.914893617021277
6185065,1,B00HNGC4YY,"Such a convoluted mess.  The only thing remotely good about this movie is the creature concepts but even then they aren't shown enough.  I had been following this movie for a while, all the way back to when it was just a concept piece and was truly excited to see it finished.  However, pretty much everything about this movie made me angry.  The story or lack there of, the characters or lack of depth, the connection between him as a child and now, the death of his parents, the mark on his stomach, the blah blah blah blah it's all bad.  Maybe this is the first chapter in what is supposed to be an epic story but dear god what a way to make me never want to watch the sequel.  I'm not trolling or hating just for the sake of it.  I truly was disappointed in this movie.",1399939200,4,773,4.147651006711409
6185066,2,B00HNGC4YY,"Reminiscent of ""Night of The Comet"" in much the same way that something that leaves a  bad taste in your mouth will remind you of something you enjoyed.  Stilted writing, poor acting...pretty much cured me of being a ""French Film Snob"".",1399766400,,236,4.7317073170731705
6185067,4,B00HNGC4YY,"The movie is solid ....everthing about it is well done...it could have had a better ending ,...but good scify thriller!! I ENJOYED IT.",1399680000,3,134,4.869565217391305
6185068,3,B00HNGC4YY,"I watched this based on another review, I was expecting this to up hold the front picture on the cover of this film (some what scary). Well, that's not the case; I should have caught this on scifi or netflix. First of all, it must have been a review of the person who wrote this film. There was no warning indicating this was in French and not English . The movie was not quite convencing at all, I prefer movies that at least feel realistic . ""Dead Shadows"" started out feeling as if it was going to be ok ,but towards the end was a bust. Trust me I'm only being honest ,if you are in for the night and would like to to just order a movie order another and wait for this to hit you cable network folks save your money.  All in all , it was a ok movie, but it's not worth spending $3.99 on.",1399680000,2,790,3.9685534591194966
6185069,4,B00HNGC4YY,"Scream Factory is branching out in a very big and positive way. Once known as the king of horror movie re-issues, they're starting to grab up some fine new material and broaden their horizons. If you count the Chiller Original Movies, then you know they've been heading this way for a while now. French sci-fi/ horror gem ""Dead Shadows"" can now be added to the list. Imagine ""Night of the Comet"" blended together with ""The Thing"" and you get an idea of what to expect from this creepy little flick.

Chris has been a recluse ever since seeing his parents die eleven years earlier on the eve of Halley's Comet's fly-over of the Earth. Deathly afraid of the dark, he keeps to himself and doesn't leave his flat very often. He decides to break his own rules to celebrate the appearance of another comet at a party with his beautiful neighbor. As the comet passes by our planet, the people around him become increasingly violent. He soon discovers there's more behind their erratic behavior than just a gravitational change or ingesting too much alcohol.

""Dead Shadows"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (2.35:1). Most of the film takes place at night, but you can still see everything fairly well. The clarity of the picture does show some of the limitations in CGI, but it's not enough to be too distracting and pull you out of the film.

The audio for ""Dead Shadows"" features a DTS-HD Master 5.1 mix. All the freaky slithering sounds, screams, and other chilling atmospheric noises will give you the shivers. You'll find yourself looking over your shoulder for a tentacle or two trying to grab you.

""Dead Shadows"" is considered to be not rated. If put before the MPAA, it would easily earn an R rating. There are plenty of gory and disturbing sequences of violence and alien transformations. I found myself even cringing at some points. The movie contains some sexual content, nudity, and language as well.

As usual, Scream Factory packs the Blu-ray version of ""Dead Shadows"" full of bonus material. There's a ""Making of"" featurette and a video interview with Producer/Director David Cholewa. Theatrical and teaser trailers are included as well.

""Dead Shadows"" is one of those great ""straight-and-to-the-point"" movies. It doesn't take thirty minutes of your valuable time gearing up and going through the motions. It establishes characters quickly and gets to the meat, potatoes, and gore. The movie is such a thrill-ride that when the credits roll you're left begging for more. That's how you know you've just seen something unique and different. How often are you left feeling like that these days?",1396051200,14,2618,4.911764705882353

6185071,5,B00HNGC4YY,"what a nice surprise .It was fast paced , too fast at time .It looked good
Honestly the film didn't look low budget and it looked and felt like a high budget horror film. Hell it was better than half the horror films we get nowadays. A potential cult classic and a french director that is one to watch",1412726400,,301,4.11864406779661
6185072,3,B00HNGC4YY,Ok movie. Very short,1412640000,,20,4.25
6185073,1,B00HNGC4YY,"This is pretty much -- NOTHING!!! I'll admit I watch the occasional horror movie even though they are boring but this one enters a new realm of being completely totally forgettable. The ""ending"" makes the rest of the movie feel like it was an introduction and you are waiting for the movie to start. I've forgotten the name of the movie but it is suspiciously like the movie a year or two back about the couple who just found out she is pregnant and he is changed into a monster by the aliens. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1411862400,,532,4.2772277227722775

6185075,5,B00HNGC4YY,"This flick was good. I'm not sure what the budget was, however some of the visuals are not well done - yet overall it doesn't detract from the movie. This was an awesome body modification movie, and at times the visuals are great. Overall, I say if you enjoy horror, you will enjoy this flick. It's a fresh story in a genre overrun with duplicates and copies.",1411344000,,359,4.373134328358209
6185076,4,B00HNGC4YY,there was a lot of potential that they did not follow up on as far as what they could have done with the plot and at just a little over an hour you would think they could have put some more into it but it was better than a lot of stuff out there. just short of being a great movie.  5 stars for the seller who got it to me in the 2 day prime shipping.,1409961600,,351,3.5584415584415585
6185077,2,B00HNGC4YY,weird show?? not bad though.,1404432000,,28,4.8
6185078,2,B00HNGC4YY,"Beautifully filmed, lousy script.",1404345600,,33,7.5
6185079,2,B00HNGC4YY,"The film opens with some nice special effects and scenes from outer space as an object breaks off of some dark matter and enters the blue planet...the one covered with water and called ""Earth."" The story centers around Chris (Fabian Wolfrom) who had some sort of alien encounter as a child and is afraid of the dark. Ten years later a comet arrives and aliens once again occupy Paris. Chris goes to a party and drinks some drink laced with....who knows and then starts seeing faces melt like he took too much acid. But wait! It seems this dumb stuff is somehow real as aliens do whatever it is evil aliens do.

The film started great until someone opened their mouth then it was Oh oh. This is not dubbed very well. I don't mean 60's Italian film bad, but it was noticeable. The plot was not well developed. You had some idea about aliens, but the invading alien horde wasn't really explained and the night time scenes peaked your interest, but not excitement level. Not as entertaining as that Hitler/Nazi thing at the center of the earth, but more realistic.

8633721,4,B00HNGC4YY,"This film is almost like a French version of Lamberta Bava's DEMONS and DEMONS 2. that's the best way to describe it only instead of a curse foretold by Nostrodamus, this film tells the story of a comet that passes so close to the Earth that it causes bizarre (and at times, horrifying) mutations in Paris, and I suppose other places on the Earth as well, but this film's storyline sticks to Paris. Our hero(?) goes to a late night comet party given by friends. At a later part of the festivities everyone passes out but don't regain consciousness in the same form they were before. There are a lot of action scenes and not much speaking (which is subtitled into English) but it propels the story forward into a nightmare H.P. Lovecraft would have been proud to have written. There are so many great scenes that I don't want to spoil them for you so I'll end this review with a brief note...watch for the scene where our hero encounters a woman on the streets who isn't just another pretty face.",1482624000,,995,4.472527472527473
8633722,4,B00HNGC4YY,"Not a bad movie, a little slow to start.  But it was establishing characters and story.  I did like it though for the most part.
 I just wish there was more mutation showed, There was a bit shown in but a lot of it was people in make up  , But there were some interesting mutations though.  And just when I was getting interested  it ended,  I want to see more .",1453766400,,362,3.9444444444444446
8633723,3,B00HNGC4YY,"The movie is about a comet that is going to hit the city of Paris. When it crosses through the atmosphere all the electricity through the city goes out. To make matters bad is that the people effected by the comet start turning into murderous psychopaths. What makes matters even worse is that they start transforming into hideous John Carpenter's The Thing like monsters. With humanity in Paris dwindling and only a few survivors, can any human make it out alive?

The movie was really slow at the beginning and slowly picked up in the middle and the end. Most of the action and horror starts when it is dark. But the creature affects were really good, at least that's what I think. It was just slow to get too the action and scary parts.",1441584000,,739,4.474074074074074

8633725,1,B00HNGC4YY,"The main character spends a lot of this movie unconsciousness waking up to 'what happened'.  The ending was completely vague.  What the hell happened to the dumb woman who was saved by soldiers who gave her a gun and told her to fight with them and she huddled on the ground watching them die without lifting a finger?  If she died, I'd give this movie an extra star.  It is too bad the soldiers didn't just keep driving leaving that worthless excuse of a human being behind.",1436659200,,475,4.425287356321839
