1918852,1,B0000CEROF,"This was nothing more than an advertisement for a couple of ex-SEAL's who started a company. Obviously based on entry techniques, clearing, (etc...) it shows nothing interesting and was a complete waste of money. After the second disk I turned it off, and just gave it to someone.

And as a Person who actually did CQB in Fallujah (Operation Phatom Fury - Second Battalion Of Fallujah), these techniques are outdated to say the leased.  I won't go into detail, but ask someone who's actually experienced these things in real life, not some ""SEALs"" that claim to have done it in some ""far off unnamed land""",1233532800,,389,4.542857142857143

7999142,1,B0000CEROF,"This is just about the cheesiest DVD there is. Even Ken Good, the guy in this film admits its junk.  Note the 5-star reviewer seems pretty contrived.  I agree with the guy from Helsinki.  Its basically a 70's infomercial.",1162944000,4,221,4.615384615384615
7999143,3,B0000CEROF,"I thought this DVD series was ok. I think the knife stuff is good, because they don't pretend to be experts, and the one guys says, ""the more I know about the knife, the more I fear it"". Damn right ! I am a student of various southeast Asian martial arts systems, and I can tell you, an untrained guy with a knife is a force to be reckoned with, and a guy with training is a real monster. The thing about house clearing is good and demonstrates the dangers faced by police, for example, in trying to clear a house, if, for example, one guy has a knife inside the house. I have about 10 years of martial arts training (kali, silat, boxing, jujitsu, etc.) and I didn't find anything in here to be wild or unrealistic. I think they admitted where they were weak. I also have some handgun training and certification, and I didn't find the handgun stuff weak either. I don't know anything about rifles, so that part I can't judge. The series is not bad, I think cops could learn from it, for example, about house clearing issues !",1146096000,4,1025,4.288659793814433
7999144,1,B0000CEROF,"I cannot believe these things are still out there!!!  Can somebody please stop the DVD press!  I cannot watch them without wanting to crawl under a rock nearby....

I did this set of videos years ago and simply regret ever doing them.  Had little of no control over the content, editing, marketing language (BS), titles etc.  I learned my lesson in dealing with snot-nosed producers from the Hollywood area.

We had a company called Combative Concepts (that later dissolved) and wanted to get some marketing momentum....It worked quite well at the time.  Later, I became the founding director of a low light training institution called the SureFire Institute.  SureFire makes high-speed low-drag lights & laser for law enforcement and military folks.

I have subsequently started a training company called Strategos International, & I promise you, if I do any other videos, they will not be as idiotic as these.  We are also teamed with BlackHawk Products Group, forming a division called Night-Ops.  We are going to be challenging my former employer in their own domain.

These videos have been selling in one format or another for quite some time.  I get ZERO financial gain from them.  Saw minimal $$$ initially, but since we did not control the masters...well things happen.  Eventually the $$$ were zero & I did not want to waste my time pursuing it.  We did not want to really show anything, quite simply because we did not know who was going to eventually get their hands on them.

If you can get them for free from a friend, they might be useful as targets on the range or as mini-Frisbees.

So there is the saga.  I have warned you (as have others) don't waste your money.

Respectfully,

Ken J. Good",1123632000,36,1709,4.764505119453925
7999145,1,B0000CEROF,"Don't waist your money or time on this.  This DVD set is just an over grown advertisment.  They used the mystic of the SEALs to push this, and is more of a case of false advertisment than anything else.",1123372800,8,202,4.153846153846154
7999146,1,B0000CEROF,"This is a package of two double-sided DVD's that contain four films: Hand to hand combat, Close quarters battle, knife fighting and sniper shooting techniques. The film features a bunch of people dressed in green jumpsuits, claiming to be ex-SEALs, teaching you some of their ""fighting secrets"". At the beginning of each film, there is a disclaimer that states that these techniques or training methods do not represent the policies, procedures or training methods and philosophies of U.S. Navy of navy SEALs. So there you go, this is not a training film of navy SEAL techniques.

The H2H -film introduces some unarmed combat techniques and principles. There are some good principles taught, although they are not very advanced in nature. There is not anything wrong with the techniques, but they don't make up any self defence system, rather they are individual techniques. And they are not taught properly, only demonstrated. As these techniques are very basics, if you have some backround in martial arts, there shouldn't be anything new to you. And if you don't have any previous experience, it's very hard to grasp the techniques based on the teaching in this film. And to top it off, some of the techniques are not very realistic for a normal citizen, like prisoner handling techniques. Run time for H2H film: 0:46

In the close quarter battle -film they show how they train people in Combative Concepts, Inc. They do not teach how to do these things, rather they just tell how they train. So, there is not very much useful information in the film. And this information is not of any use for a SEAL enthusiast, either, as these training concepts do not represents those used by real SEAL units. There are some mildly interesting film clips from force on force training scenarios, but they do not show a complete training scenario. There is also a chapter where a highway patrol officer tells about his recent gunfight, which is the most interesting part in the film. Run time for CQB film: 1:03.

The knife fighting film is the best of the lot, but still that does not tell you very much. There is some interesting, and even useful information presented, but as with other subjects, they are really not instructed at all. There is discussion about defending against knife attack with using a knife, stick, improvised weapons or bare hands, but all are handled really superficially. Some of the defences were somewhat flashy, but not ""Murphy-proof"", meaning that if you miss your block, you are totally vulnerable to the attacker. There is also instruction on how to attack with a knife. Although brief, this was the most interesting part of the film. For some reason, there was some commentary by Ken Good and Dave Maynard (the directors of Combative Concepts), although they were not instructors in this film. Run time for the knife film: 0:58.

The sniper film opens with a long dramatized scene from a rescue mission. This dramatization continues throughout the film, with short scenes between chapters. These scenes total about 15-20 minutes. The instructional film gives very basic and/or superficial information from several aspects of long range sniping, starting from the basics of establishing a shooting platform, to estimating the effects of temperature on accuracy. Some of the information is misleading or flawed in addition of being severely lacking in detail. For example, information on making range estimations is based to the fact that an average man is 2 meters (6 feet 6  inches) tall! That makes an error of over 10% to start with. Run time for sniper film: 1:27.

This film might be of interest for pre-adolescent SEAL wannabes, but others should stay away from this product. The best thing about this film is the price (it's just about the only good thing), but when you consider you waste four hours from your life by watching the films, it's not worth it.",1095811200,27,3886,4.916158536585366
7999147,5,B0000CEROF,"I don't know what the previous reviewer was thinking when he criticised this set of 4 program son 2 DVD's. It has excellent production values and great, applicable information, on CQB, Sniping, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Knife Techiniques.
The last two were the most relevant to me (a civilian) but all of the programs were of value. If you have basic understanding of weapons and combat, this DVD will be very useful. The next best thing would be to actually join the military or police and learn from them. Otherwise, this works very well.",1078012800,6,539,4.806451612903226
