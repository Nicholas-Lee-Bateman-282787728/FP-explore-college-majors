8455864,4,B0053XKUR2,"This movie felt quite a bit like a stage production. It takes place on a single set with three characters and the soundtrack is very simple. However, the acting is stellar and the story is well told and quite moving. This is a different sort of role for Stephen Lang. Weve seen him in so many roles where he is a physical powerhouse, and in this film, his presence is certainly a force, but much more cerebral than physical. In fact, physically, his character seems oddly frail. Dont pass this one up, and don't let the lengthy dialogue turn you off. Its well worth the wait to get to the climax.",1524441600,,596,4.378378378378378
