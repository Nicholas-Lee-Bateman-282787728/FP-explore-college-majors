8472563,1,B000SNUNW4,"I waited awhile to see this film and at the price I thought I'll get it.  Then I was disappointed in the film.  The story line was great a group of Christians that specialize in helping persucuted Christians and bringing needed aid.  But the acting was very flat and unemotional.  There was to many characters that you can't get attached to.  Not enogh time on the charcters to get to know them.  They seemed to be just there.  The gospel message was not really there either.  The training scenes were way to long, they covered almost half of the film and tried to be a b rate music video.  As another christian film maker I was diappoined greatly.  Give it was a lower budget, but I have worked with 0 budget films and they came out more entertaining.",1257638400,,752,4.384057971014493
