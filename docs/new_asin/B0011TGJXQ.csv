3067837,5,B0011TGJXQ,"If you have been a fan of Patrice Oneal - former host of VH1's Web Junk, or from Opie and Anthony, or the Office or Arrested Development - then you will love this DVD. Apparently he has been producing a bunch of web videos as part of a whole show. The videos are outrageous! Carlos Mencia wishes he could be this funny and outrageous. It is really funny, not for the squeamish or politically correct.",1198195200,10,400,4.346666666666667
3067838,5,B0011TGJXQ,"Finally, Patrice on DVD!  I've been watching the web show since it launched but this DVD brings everything I loved about the show plus a ton of added extras!  Patrice's commentary is an audio stand-up routine, the bonus footage is hilarious, and the episodes look great on my big screen.  I already gave it to my cousin for Christmas and he can't stop watching it...great gift idea.  More Patrice!",1198195200,8,397,4.7101449275362315

3067845,2,B0011TGJXQ,"First I wanna say R.I.P. Patrice, but i guess I didn't realize that this was not the actual show. That being said I was disappointed. I mean who really wants to watch the making of such a show? I did laugh but it's definitely not worth the money",1326067200,2,245,4.125

3067849,5,B0011TGJXQ,"Since I first saw Patrice Oneal on Comedy Central doing stand-up and his subsequent appearances on Chappelle's Show, I haven't stopped laughing! However, The Patrice Oneal Show started slow for me, and the laughs were more chuckles than anything for me. At one point, I wondered if I had a good choice in purchasing it, and that's when I started screaming laughing! Chemistry is a good thing, especially when those around you are comedicly on the same level. The marriage of the supporting cast finally started happening, and I will definitely keep this in my collection.",1291334400,,571,4.958333333333333
3067850,5,B0011TGJXQ,"This is a great dvd set of Patrice O'Neals online series, The Patrice O'Neal Show.  It is very funny and has some great bits.  My only problem with it is i wish it were longer, but for whats there its hysterical. I highly reccomend checkin it out if you're a Patrice O'Neal fan or a Opie and Anthony fan.

I really wish Patrice O'Neal would have some stand up dvds released.  He truly is a funny, rude yet intelligent comedian who should be much more well-known than he currently is.",1287100800,,483,4.333333333333333
