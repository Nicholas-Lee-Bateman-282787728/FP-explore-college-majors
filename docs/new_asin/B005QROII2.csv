4859882,4,B005QROII2,"Nuanced characters and an uncertain outcome make this film more interesting than many of its contemporaries.  The ""Laura"" influence is hard to miss, but ""The Voice of Merrill"" is decidedly its own film and well worth viewing.",1391385600,2,225,5.081081081081081
4859883,4,B005QROII2,"This movie is a great murder mystery, where the murder actually is removed to the background.  Instead, the viewer's focus is turned towards a romantic triangle with a very surprising ending. If you like Hitchcock, you will like this production.  Also the battle of wits between a husband and wife is no less entertaining than the battle of wits between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty.  Great character development.  If you like movies from this era of films, you will enjoy this one.",1360540800,16,492,4.963414634146342
4859884,5,B005QROII2,Exciting all the way through,1415059200,,28,4.8
4859885,4,B005QROII2,"This was well done, a bit grainy and the audio isn't as good as I'd like, but the story and the acting overcome those objections.  I like it when a story wraps up all the loose ends, especially a murder mystery, and this one does so beautifully.  The dialogue is well done, not a single superfluous word in the movie, and, the banter between husband and wife sublime.  There was so much suggested by their repartee that you wrote a whole back story for yourself as the movie went on.  To top it off, the chemistry between the characters was quite good.  Excellent film making and story telling for sure.",1414540800,4,603,4.445454545454545
4859886,3,B005QROII2,Fairly engrossing little movie. Dragged a bit and the husband is insufferable with all his yelling at people but yeah it's not bad. I made it thru the whole thing.,1413331200,,163,4.466666666666667
4859887,3,B005QROII2,a nice little mystery movie.,1412899200,,28,4.8
4859888,1,B005QROII2,"The video sound was what I can best describe as  'hollow'. I Struggled with it, sound Up, then down - finally threw in the ball and gave up because majority of time spent adjusting - watch a few minutes... then playback ... UGH!!
It was so bad, that as you can see from my acct info,  I attempted watching, - but as 'records will show, ""I never even finished movie after an hour or so  ...  two days in a row.
It is said that one has to 'pick their battles' ... this one, ""EH""... not worth the stress - or the cash..",1412380800,4,516,3.9805825242718447
4859889,1,B005QROII2,Not interesting enough to keep my attention.,1411430400,,44,5.428571428571429
4859890,4,B005QROII2,"This film had plenty of tension and unsavory characters.  Writers, scoundrels and investigators none of whom are particularly sympathetic- all come together for  some worthwhile twists and turns.  If you enjoy these old films- it's worth a watch.",1406851200,,246,5.421052631578948
4859891,4,B005QROII2,"Very well written mystery/suspense film.  Performances are solid.  Has some interesting things to say about artistic egos and the like.  Well worthwhile, under the radar gem.",1405382400,,174,5.615384615384615
4859892,2,B005QROII2,"boring , poor quality of graphics , paused a lot. i did not enjoy it at all just boring and not very suspenseful",1399334400,,112,3.9130434782608696
4859893,4,B005QROII2,"I love good film noire and Valerie Hobson.  All the requirements were there:  lighting effects, unhappy characters who pursue the wrong goals for themselves, and effective use of the period - post WWII issues, especially the angst and disillusionment, especially the holocaust side by side with American problems like anti-Semitism, racism , violence and greed, war profiteering (speaking of all film noire.)  ""Merrill"" is quite suspenseful with complex characters.

Valerie is a beautiful and talented actress of the period.  She's also good in ""I Know Where I'm Going"" and the WWII thriller ""The Spy Wore Black.""  I read that she died of MS and in her last films,the actors moved around her so she could do the part.

8483639,3,B005QROII2,"This film is ""streamed"" in SD so don't expect a pristine print. It has evidently not been restored and has lots of reel change cues and dirt marks.
The film itself is a murder mystery with three suspects. The plot features several twists towards the end and some pretty outrageous coincidences.
Watch this with your critical judgment in suspension and you may experience moderate enjoyment.
The only actor I was familiar with was Valerie Hobson but the cast was adequate.",1511222400,,471,4.9
8483640,2,B005QROII2,"The beginning of this movie is horrible but it slowly gets better.  It first seems that plot and continuity will never make an appearance in this movie.  The movie begins with a murder and the police investigation then, for the next hour, the murder is forgotten about and we are presented with a love affair.  A married woman starts an affair the moment she meets a guy and immediately her Svengali-like husband has figured out what is going on and has his wife invite the her lover to dinner.

I suggest skipping this movie because the first half is quite bad but, if you do watch it, don't stop halfway through because it does get much better.

It is odd that there are no young actors in this movie.  The male actors in this movie appear to be past 60, especially the cops.",1507939200,,777,4.398601398601398
8483641,1,B005QROII2,"Huh?  A thriller?  Weak plot, completely boring, slow, and not mysterious or thrilling at all.  I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one; please don't waste yours!",1487462400,2,171,4.633333333333334
8483642,3,B005QROII2,It was okay.,1464566400,,12,3.3333333333333335

8483644,2,B005QROII2,Must not have been very good as I can't even remember what is was about.  Most of these old British films are terribly faded out and usually quite stuffy.,1454457600,,154,4.310344827586207
8483645,5,B005QROII2,this is a very entertaining movie,1452470400,,33,4.666666666666667
8483646,4,B005QROII2,Great British murder mystery. However I don't think it's really a property row movie? But if you're looking for something to watch on a Sunday afternoon this movie for you.,1447286400,,172,4.766666666666667
8483647,4,B005QROII2,"Interesting characters, even interesting plot. The interpersonal dynamics were odd but odd enough to be interesting to watch, even mildly unpredictable. Not my favorite movie but a pleasure to watch for its older classic forms.",1444953600,,227,5.514285714285714
8483648,3,B005QROII2,"A bit dated and contrived whodunit (Think Vanilla Ice possibly committing murder to hide his lip syncing), but enjoyable for the cast performances.",1444262400,,147,5.434782608695652
