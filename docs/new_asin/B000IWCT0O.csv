8147606,2,B000IWCT0O,"I ordered this DVD on the assumption that it would contain quite a bit of vintage tornado footage. Instead what I got was a PSA on tornadoes from the 1950's with very little tornado footage. Its not a bad little PSA but since its from forever ago its pretty outdated and contains some false information. In addition the fact that its only 14 minutes begs that another tornado film or two to be placed on this DVD. The only good thing I can say is that is does have footage of the Warner Robins, Georgia tornado from April 30th 1953 which my grandparents happened witness.",1242950400,2,571,4.447619047619048
