8515195,4,B007EBYZWC,"These DVD""S have several other speakers on them at a conference - not just Mr. Hovind. I learned some interesting things. I find it funny whenever someone starts ranting about how Mr. Hovind's  PHD. not being from an accredited school. Before the internet of today - if you wanted to get a degree - but not want to quit your job - you took classes by mail. Today you take them on line. Even if his PHD. is from a diploma mill - his other degree's aren't. It's like listening to a 250 pound heavy weight crying about ""He's not a real heavy weight!! He only weighs only 150 pounds!!"" after the skinny dwarf just got through beating you up in the ring. Mr. Hovind is the best debater I've ever seen on any subject.  If you want to learn how to debate - get his debate series on DVD. HE make college professors with ""real PHD""S look like idiots.",1444003200,,841,4.25
