8099253,5,B000CMNJK4,"5 Stars for the film but 1 Star for the dvd quality and minus -1 Star for the non-existent VCI Entertainment customer service. This is a wonderful and unusual film.  Read the other reviews for some of the details.  There is also a great dvd extra feature about western ghost towns hosted by Rip Torn.  THERE IS A PROBLEM:  Another reviewer mentioned some technical problems with this disc.  Indeed there are some.  The picture pixilates in places (color squares appear out of nowhere).  The picture also freeze-frames in places.  I bought my copy directly from VCI Entertainment.  I e-mailed them about the problems and they never bothered to respond.  That being said, if you don't mind some technical problems, you'll enjoy this disc.  As of January 2014, this disc is still in print and can be purchased from VCI for under $15--so don't get hoodwinked into paying over $100 from third party sellers here on Amazon.",1390348800,,917,4.814102564102564
8099254,4,B000CMNJK4,"Nice cowboy documentary film with a very informative cowboy commentary.  Overall good print quality with some bad splicing during dialogue at one spot.  My copy had some digital break-up in spots during the film which looked like they occured during the production process.  The extra TV documentary on ghost towns is quite good with no break-ups.  It says it is program #3, but I have not been able to find any other episodes of this program listed.",1329868800,,450,4.805194805194805

8099256,4,B000CMNJK4,This is a beautifully shot (in color) and edited documentary about the life of cowboys in early 1950's New Mexico.  Somehow the people who put together the DVD located four of the original cowboys who appeared in the film and got them to do a supplemenetal sound track commentary.  They are a real hoot -- authentic cowboys like this are a dying breed.  I saw this on television in black and white in the late 1950's. Never knew till now that it was a theatrical feature made in color.,1138579200,3,485,4.426966292134831
