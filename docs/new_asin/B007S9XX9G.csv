5109716,5,B007S9XX9G,"What a joy to watch and hear musicians from more than one culture play together, taking pleasure in one another's company.  My gratitude to YoYoMa for once again making this happen.  Such events dissolve our differences, not resulting in mediocrity but in a broadening of and delight in our shared humanity--something words so often cannot do.",1347321600,,343,5.107142857142857
5109717,5,B007S9XX9G,"Fans of the O'Connor, Myers, Yo-Yo Ma Appalacian recordings will have plenty to enjoy here at Boston's House of Blues.  The energy and enjoyment of the musicians is palpable, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this concert.  I was sorry Mark O'Connor was not included, but nonetheless this was an outstanding program.  I guess you could call this a classical/bluegrass fusion.  Bottom line:  it is great American music.  This is one DVD I'll be watching over and over.  A few minor complaints:  the extras were part of the concert and should have been inserted in the program, and information on who composed what is lacking (except for the Bach piece).  There is no weak link in this ensemble; everyone shines, and it was a delight to see the interaction and fun these musicians had that night.",1346544000,3,800,4.781021897810219
5109718,5,B007S9XX9G,"My two-cents worth: After watching the DVD, ""The Goat Rodeo Sessions Live,"" my recurring thought was: ""Gracious sakes, such great virtuosity!"" The musicians are Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Edgar Meyer (string bass, piano), Chris Thile (mandolin, violin, guitar, vocal), and Stuart Duncan (violin, banjo, mandolin), with Aoife O'Donovan (vocal). Although I do not understand certain modern musical ideas or structures (or lack thereof), these performances were captivating, and I marveled at how, the moment that I thought that I was listening to classical music, there was a seeming snippet of bluegrass or folk or jazz music. Other than a bit of Bach and traditional music here and there, the compositions and arrangements were by these five musicians. I found this DVD to be a noteworthy project.",1345420800,3,788,5.312
5109719,4,B007S9XX9G,"Concert was originally simulcast to movie theaters nationwide. Recording omits virtually all of the artists' remarks, which makes this a disappointment. Should have added, not subtracted from the concert.",1344384000,4,204,6.068965517241379
5109720,5,B007S9XX9G,"This recording of the `Goat Rodeo' sessions records the first public performance of this group of musicians who are a group of talented and technically skilful musicians from different genres who might never normally meet musically. This opening statement is to paraphrase the comment by Stuart Duncan made as his descriptor of the group. To paraphrase another group member, Yo Yo Ma adds that for some, this music is `outside the box' but for these musicians there is no box. It is normal and just what they do.

In struggling to describe the music contained in this recording I found myself outside the box but struggling to get in! This is not `cross-over' music but it is made up of an amalgamation of several contributing genres. These could loosely be described as containing elements of country & western, blues, a bit jazzy at times, elements of modern classical and all put together in a uniquely individual manner relying on individual talents blended to produce something interestingly new.

The music has been composed or arranged by various members of the group but there is a strong improvisational driving force such as to be found in jazz. The title `Goat Rodeo' has been chosen to suggest the wilder side to this situation. The music is essentially easy to listen to without being `easy listening' as a genre type. I found it to be refreshingly interesting and diverting.

The main feature lists 10 music tracks and lasts for some 55 minutes and there are 5 bonus music tracks running for some 22 minutes. There is no apparent difference in quality or content between these two selections so I have not understood why they did not simply run as a complete 77 minute concert.

The imaging is crystal clear and involving. The sound is excellent in Digital 5.1, PCM 5.1 surround and stereo.

This concert is an unusual concept and I found it musically rewarding. On its own unique terms I would suggest a 5 star rating, there being no means of relevant comparison other than applied musicianship across genres. I would hope that future purchasers would respond with the level of enthusiasm shown by the original concert audience.",1341532800,23,2143,4.86027397260274
5109721,5,B007S9XX9G,"This is one great DVD..The music is mostly original, and is done with style, grace, rhythm and skill..It is throughly enjoyable...I recommend it to all who love music...Doc",1340755200,,172,5.178571428571429
5109722,5,B007S9XX9G,"Saw Goat Rodeo on PBS TV, 4 amazing virtuoso musicians having a great time, my review title is ""Brain Candy"" because I think just listening to this ensemble will make you smarter (at a minimum it will stimulate your brain in a good way), the sound is like nothing you have heard. If you enjoy super high quality creative music you will love this I think. My wife who is not a music person at all was saying what is this? My 17 year old boy on the other hand was saying, ""Mom"" this is really good, so musical quality and musicality can be appreciated across generations and by most everyone that appreciates great quality instrumental music.",1338076800,10,640,4.478632478632479
5109723,5,B007S9XX9G,"We saw the cinecast of this concert in a movie theater on January 31, 2012.  It was extraordinary, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally being released on DVD.  The individual artistry and the tight ensemble playing are second to none.  You won't be disappointed.",1335312000,13,269,4.804347826086956

5109726,3,B007S9XX9G,Well I'm going to be a dissenting voice and say that I find this 'interesting' - 'impressive' even - rather than inspiring and authentic. Sometimes a few rough edges are what it's all about.,1433894400,,190,4.617647058823529

5109732,5,B007S9XX9G,"This is a great DVD for anyone who loved the Goad Rodeo Album; you will not get to see these guys together for a live performance any time soon so I recommend buying this. As masters of their instruments they each bring a unique perspective to this album that creates a truly extraordinary listening experience.

If you enjoy the music of Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Yoyo Ma or The Punch Brothers this is right up your alley.

The production quality and audio is top notch.",1402617600,,476,4.523255813953488

5109737,4,B007S9XX9G,This was a top notch performance by master musicians. A little heavy on the classic style at the expense of the charming and  rhythm of great Bluegrass.,1376697600,,152,4.62962962962963

5109739,5,B007S9XX9G,"I've always been a fan of Yo-Yo Ma as a classical musician, but his crossing the musical line with performers in other genre is simply incredible.  I Loved ""Appalachian Journey"" featuring Yo-Yo Ma with Edger Meyer and Mark O'Connor. Couldn't watch it enough.  ""Goat Rodeo Sessions Live"" with Stuart Duncan, Edger Meyer, Chis Thile and, yes, Yo-Yo Ma, is even better.  I highly recommend it.",1370131200,,390,4.969230769230769

5109742,5,B007S9XX9G,"As a musician who also plays at varying levels of proficiency these four instruments, I am in complete awe watching this video. Nothing short of remarkable - very hard to imagine being able to play like they do - very humbling.",1356739200,2,227,4.560975609756097
5109743,5,B007S9XX9G,"If you like what this group put out in their studio effort of the Goat Rodeo Sessions, then don't even think twice about ordering this live performance on Blu-Ray or DVD. Just do it! Fans of classical, new-grass, progressive grass, and just plain music in general should get it, there is something for everyone here. Those who aren't into either classical or bluegrass/Appalachian folk can still find much to enjoy in this original blend of jazzy/bluesy rhythms in a classical and bluegrass/folk setting. Words don't describe it. Look to more work from these artists in other projects such as Yo Yo Ma's two other Appalachian albums with similar musicians, Thile's Solo and Punch Brothers albums, Thile with Edgar Meyer, etc.. Bela Fleck is the only missing piece of this puzzle, they should do some recordings with him with the entire group!",1347926400,6,842,4.9787234042553195

8521631,5,B007S9XX9G,"Somehow, the Goat Rodeo Sessions album flew under my radar, despite the fact that I was aware of three of the four musicians (as well as Ms O'Donovan). I was compelled to find a live concert DVD with Chris Thile after seeing him recently perform solo (one of the top ten concerts in a 45 year run of live music attendance). This came up in searches, I read the reviews, and I bought it instantly.

As a lifelong musician, I look for three main aspects in music: virtuosity, composition and arrangement. Many of my favorite experiences have been biased towards one or two of these, yet it is quite uncommon to see an almost perfect balance between all three.

If you don't know already, these 4 players are truly among the best on the planet on their respective instruments in terms of both technical ability and sheer creative approach. However, technical excellence can be initially exciting and then tiring when the written pieces and arrangements are on a lower level (this can sometimes be a problem with jazz). This is not the case here. The composing is first-rate, fresh, complex, layered and reflects influences ranging from American classical (think Ives and Copland) to bluegrass to jazz (one piece reminds me of ECM chamber jazz) to folk (particularly Celtic). To top it off, the arrangements (which often constrain or elevate an existing composition) are unbelievably well-tailored to the unique strengths of each player. I will be listening/viewing this numerous times just to focus on one of these three aspects.

To give an idea of how much I enjoyed this: 30 seconds in to the first piece I stated that this would be a new favorite. After the 3rd or 4th piece I was already wondering how long I would have to wait until experiencing it again. My foot was in constant motion and I was giggling and laughing uncontrollably every 15 seconds or so. The joy emanating from the musicians was so evident that it drew me into their world completely.

This will most likely have you feeling like your soul is being tickled and will bring tears to your eyes over and over. If you like gorgeous, well-written, impeccably played acoustic music - that mixes a number of genres into a truly new style - then don't hesitate to buy. You'll thank me later.",1451606400,,2255,4.715736040609137
