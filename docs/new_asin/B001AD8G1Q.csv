8276919,4,B001AD8G1Q,"For all of the Poverty Row cinema fans out there this one is a keeper. There are some really jaw dropping moments in this movie. Again, this is Poverty  Row so don't expect great lighting, cinematography, or production. But if you like these kinds of movies you like this",1451865600,,271,4.530612244897959

8276921,4,B001AD8G1Q,"At last  a Sinister Cinema movie I can say is good, not great, but good. Great plot with a lot of turns and the ending is great. As for the picture, very good as is the sound. Good movie you will want to see over and over. You cannot say that about many of Sinister Cinema movies.",1412899200,,280,3.912280701754386
8276922,4,B001AD8G1Q,"Very well acted and directed, scripted, edited.  An engaging movie -- the story line is good, the acting better than good.  Although a very old movie, this one is worth watching.  I was impressed that the movie does not have that ""corny"" or ""hackneyed"" effect that we get so often with old movies.  The characters are rendered fresh, and although a bit stereotyped they somehow come across as well-developed instead of cartoonish.  I was entertained all the way through.",1402099200,2,470,4.89873417721519
