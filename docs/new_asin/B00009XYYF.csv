1896792,5,B00009XYYF,"When we set out to create this series of DVDs, we wanted to achieve something that all of the previous accounts of a documentary nature had not - to present this material without a filter, in a way to allow the viewer to see the maximum amount of material - both video and audio - in the best quality possible. In short, as lifelong students of the U.S. space program, we wanted to put together a collection the way we wished to see it - the way it happened.
Most importantly, we set out to present the complete television transmissions and onboard motion picture film for individual missions - material that just hasn't been available before. This material is purposely left in its original form, albiet with new digital transfers, color correction where necessary and possible, and digital noise reduction.
To do this we realized we would have to use certain unconventional methods. For example, we wished to present multiple angles of footage from rollout, suitup, etc. To do this required us to use different angles out of context, so that from time to time certain events were shown a couple of times so that the varied angles could be presented. Unless one realizes this was done to present multiple angles one might mistake it for material out of order.
Nearly all of the 16mm film from EVA training, suitup, astronauts visiting the launch pad (all of which was re-transferred from the original using modern, digital telecines) was shot silent, and since we also wished to present as much audio as possible from mission events such as countdowns, we have married this audio to that footage. The result is the maximum amount of primary source material available on the subject and results in important audio from other events used on previously silent film.
Lastly, especially for launch vehicles, we wanted to present the material we had only previously seen in short clips on documentaries, such as pad cameras, in its entirety. For those interested in the creation and flight of these vehicles, this material is fascinating, and filled with insightful information.
Much of the material on these sets is presented, purposefully, the way it was shot. Some of the Hollywood storytelling created on this subject is wonderful, we love that, too, but  as a chronicle of the greatest explorations of mankind the material deserved to be presented without such a filter. This is the way it happened, and it is amazing.
Very soon in 2004, a six-disc chronicle of Apollo 15 and a three-disc edition on the Saturn V will be released.",1076803200,31,2530,4.856481481481482
1896793,3,B00009XYYF,"After reading the other reviews on this site, all of which granted five stars, I bought this disk set.  As a great admirer of the Apollo program and a reasonably well-informed student of that effort, I fell compelled to offer a different review.
Positives: As others have noted, there is seldom-seen footage and it is really good to see.  The use of NASA audio and the definite lack of overdramatization  (that smothers some other notable multi-disk videos) is also welcome.  Seeing the entire lunar EVA is good to see (finally).  The minimalistic narratives at times help focus the viewer on what was really going on.  There are some uses of multiple-angle views that are novel, but the astonauts' post-flight audio commentary (covering some key mission events)are more interesting.  These are significant positives that the Apollo fan will appreciate.
Negatives:  While there is some great footage and audio bits, one should remember that that was the result of NASA's prodigious work -- and considerable public money.  The producers' job was to assemble and present them as a coherent narrative.  They do their best when they simply let the NASA video play (for example, in the case of the entire EVA).  But what they themselves have done is quite modest and at times thoughtless.  First, they provide absolutely no overall narrative, although several methods -- a second audio track, accompanying booklet, use of subtitles, an occasional diagram -- could have been used.  Those not familiar with the mission's major milestones (preparation, science goals, staging, critcal manuevers, etc.) will not gain insight and will be confused by some of the offerings.  Take, for example, the footage labeled ""probe and drogue"" (disk 3), presented after the landing footage.  With knowledge of the mission, one can figure out that it was taken shortly after LM-CSM docking, before the landing.  But if you don't have this knowledge, or even what the probe and drogue assemblies are, you're left in the dark and perhaps puzzled as to its place in the mission.  The lack of context confuses and fails to educate.  Repeatedly, the disks choose not to illuminate the viewer when they easily could have (again, through optional subtitles or 2nd audio track).  On disk 1, one sees ~15 minutes of video from a top-mounted camera looking down at the vehicle, poised for launch.  It is accompanied by very sparse commentary from an Apollo public-affairs official who largely marks time until launch.  One sits through at least five segments of no audio, each lasting 1.5 to 3 minutes!  Even one predisposed to like this kind of DVD gets restless at staring at this uninformative shot for that long.  Finally, the editing at times is thoughtless.  During the section on vehicle roll-out, there are many nice shots of the vehicle, launch tower, and mobile service structure. However, they are inanely and repeatedly shown out of order, one minute ready to launch, the next with the service gantry surrounding it (i.e., events that are days apart).  And while presenting NASA audio of the countdown 2 hrs prior to launch, they show the 3 astronauts on top of the launch tower...in shirt sleeves!  Later, they show them getting suited up, again with the audio mismatched to the time when they're already in the command module!  These large mismatches were simply not necessary.
In summary, I think a die-hard Apollo fan (such as myself) will welcome the additional footage and the lack of over-the-top dramatization.  The moon EVA footage is a real highlight. However, the $45 cost, the nice packaging and dramatic menus belie the lack of useful editing and supportive narrative. This set is will interest Apollo admirers, but doesn't do the less-informed viewer any favors.  Finally, I have no financial interest in this product.",1076630400,22,3811,5.0528
1896794,5,B00009XYYF,"This is not a polished, ""sit back and eat popcorn"" documentary ala National Geographic or Nova.  It is a collection of raw NASA video and audio feeds.  Where there is commentary, the commentator's delivery while rather bland is filled with facts and figures (as in the section on the Saturn V in the Vehicle Assembly Building).
That being said, it is an AWESOME collection of video and audio, things you didn't see in the network news coverages.  There's even audio of Armstrong and Aldrin during a post-mission technical debrief on the lunar approach under video of the approach with graphics describing the technical terms used in the discussion.  In many cases multiple audio tracks are available.  In the lunar approach you can listen to the Flight Directors loop, full LEM on-board voice recorder, air-to-ground, etc.  I only wish they would have included more, particularly of the initial earth orbit and preparation for the trans-lunar injection burn.
Excellent! A definite must-have for any serious space junkie.",1074211200,7,1020,5.151515151515151
1896795,5,B00009XYYF,"If you were alive in July '69 , then you know the feeling the world had as they followed the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon. This DVD set is a very impressive piece of work. The images may be raw and the audio scratchy,but it is a true representation of what went on that summer in space...I found it most interesting and informative...I have seen most films of this flight,so I was surprised to see a few clips that I had not...If you are looking for a documentry or hollywood version,look elsewhere, because this is the REAL thing...I enjoyed the multiple angles at liftoff and the multiple audio tracks to choose from during the lunar landing clip...I will definitely purchase the Apollo 16 and 17 versions as they become available...If you were interested in these missions 30 years ago and enjoy space flight today,get these DVD's before they are out of print,you will not regret it...",1072137600,6,892,4.687898089171974
1896796,5,B00009XYYF,"I have been wanting someone to do this for years. The first memory that I can recall is at age four watching the telecast of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon, and I have been hooked ever since. There have been many excellent Apollo documentaries over the years since, but this is a totally different concept.
Instead of taking the strict documentary approach and editing the raw materiel until only the subjective 'best' materiel is left, the producers show basically all the uncut, raw materiel, frequently from different perspectives or with different options. Examples here are watching the Lunar Landing film taken from the LMP window synched with numerous different soundtrack options such as the Flight Director Loop, the TELCOMM (later TELMU) loop (which is of particular interest during the 1202 and 1201 Program Alarms), the PAO loop, or the onboard recorder from Eagle.  Similarly, you can select up to six different angles to watch the launch from.
This set is simply amazing to watch. It includes all the TV transmissions and onboard 16 mm film. If you are interested in Apollo or space exploration, you absolutely must have this DVD set. You will love it.",1064016000,34,1186,4.959798994974874
1896797,5,B00009XYYF,"I am a huge Nasa Fan and am really sick of the lame DVD sets that have been released in the past!!! I have really wondered why Nasa never released comprehensive footage of not only the missions in space but also what goes on behind the scenes to make these voyages possible. Well my prayers have been awnsered. This 3 DVD set shows everything from assembling the actual rockets to the training that the astronauts undergo to take such a trip.
Almost everyone in the world has seen armstrong set foot on the moon and have heard the infamous statment ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". Thats it though, we have never been alowed to see much of anything else. Well this DVD set makes up for all of the waiting. Not only does it give complete footage  of the entire moonwalk, but also complete footage of the film made of the moon itself from Apollo while buzz and armstrong were on the moon. One of the best parts of this DVD is the actual takeoff from the launchpad which can be viewed from, If I remember correctly, 7 different views which can be swiched at a moments notice with the angle button on your DVD remote.
Other great footage includes all the broadcasts which were made for the television viewing audience. There is really too much on these DVD's to go into detail about. If you are a fan, such as I am, of the space program then buy these without a question. I have just read that the additional DVD's that are coming out will be 6 DVD's, not 3. I cant imagine how good these are going to be. Anyways to sum it up these are amazing, facinating and quite simply the best footage ever relaesed to the public for the amazing voyages. My only complaint is that it took this long to release these. Enjoy, I know I have!!!",1062633600,23,1746,4.339449541284404
1896798,5,B00009XYYF,"In short... I've been hoping to have this material for 30 years. Having seen glimpses of footage in documentaries over the years, this set finally provides all the material in one place - with excellent quality. Seeing the launch from multiple angles and hearing Armstrong describe the final approach as the film from the LM window goes by is about as close as you can get. Included is footage of training, rollout, launch, all the TV transmissions, film, EVA, and recovery. I'm hopeful more missions are to come! Highly recommended.",1061683200,12,533,4.933333333333334
1896799,5,B00009XYYF,"My ninth birthday was July 20, 1969, some guys walked on the moon. Yawn.
My Dad kept nudging me to stay awake and to make me remember this historical moment in time... I tried, but I was sleepy. The picture was fuzzy on our 9 inch tv screen. He told me by the time I was a grown up people would be taking their vacations on the moon! (he was a little off on that predicton!)
The 3 dvd set ""Apollo 11, Men on the Moon"" gives you everything you could possibly want in recapturing that impressive moment so many years ago. The film, the tv, the audio of the astronauts and mission control doing an incredible feat with grace, skill and yes, heroism. If it had a commentary track with the astronauts I would probably never leave my house, so that is the only thing that could make it better, as it is, it comes as close to perfection as humanly possible.
When there is no video of a certain point in the EVA, the producers give you the pictures the astronauts took from the surface of the moon along with the real-time audio of the events taking place.
NASA has put out some terrible looking videos over the years, with some horrific sound tracks, this IS THE REAL DEAL, exactly what I have been looking for and I am so glad I found it!
The critical moment when the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) was about to land on the moon, there were a few error messages called out from Mission Control, an alarm on the computer was going off, the guys on the ground analyzed it and said they were go for landing on the moon, and then during landing, Armstrong came to within 30 seconds of running out of fuel.... it really is amazing that these folks did this in 1969.
The producers of this dvd give you the chance to just listen to the astronauts, or just to mission control, or to hear a 5.1 surround mix, and listening to Gene Kranz do the poll for landing, Go, NO GO, was a huge thrill to me. I got chills. I got chills just thinking about it just now!
Separating the audio tracks, and giving the viewer the use of the ""angle"" button to choose what video to watch is a great bonus and shows the extent to which the producers of these dvds know how to pack in the quality, for example on Disc 2 for the EVA, on angle 3 you can watch the 16mm film from the LMP window on the LEM, the TV downlink, the Hasselblad still images and an EVA training film ....wow!  That sure beats that scratchy NASA video with the wonky music on the sound track!!!
Kudos to this team of media giants at Spacecraft Films, they made this dvd series a wonderful experience and I am looking forward to more of their offerings!",1061510400,34,2587,4.2368421052631575

1896821,5,B00009XYYF,"I am a space nut, and watch it all. This is great, good, crisp footage, and the entire moonwalk tv transmission. This is worth the price if you are into this stuff.",1169769600,,164,4.15625
1896822,5,B00009XYYF,"As an Apollo enthusiast, I was excited to view all the material contained on the Apollo 11 DVD's.  I allready had the Saturn V and B Series disks so I am allready convinced That Spacecraft Films have been in the trenches at NASA going through the hours and hours of 18mm footage and video transfers.

The set is excellent.  I allowed myself to drift back to 1969 by watching the complete TV Coverage, then moved onto the all archival footage of the Saturn mating, and rolling out from the VAB.  Regarding the video inside the Command Module, I didn't realize there was so much footage I never seen.  Also it was excellent that various shots including liftoff, and moon excursion footage was meticulously syncronized with the additional other cameras.  While Neal pulled the cord that started the LM Camera pointed to the foot of the LM, Buzz was also filming at the same time Im sure for redundancy purposes.  I can't help but wonder what the detail of today's technology would bring had we had it available in 1969.",1152921600,,1016,4.64245810055866
1896823,5,B00009XYYF,"In addition to what other reviewers have said, I found the Cape Kennedy launch pad blastoff multiangle coverage feature and 5.1 channel sound to be worth the price alone!

In a full out home theater surround audio system, with max'd out volume, it will blow your mind to see and ***HEAR*** the awesome power of 7.5 million pounds of thrust of the mighty Saturn V rocket in all its glory.  INCREDIBLE!!!

The Apollo 11 lunar landing sight fly over (from the far Eastern approach at Smyth's Sea to Western edge of the Sea of Tranquillity) from 100+ mile high orbit in the Command Module, with all three Astronauts' real time commentary, is also particularly interesting and unique about this DVD, which all Astronomer's will love.

Lastly the ""Probe and Drogue"" segment (over two hours in length) is perhaps the best in-flight TV coverage yet to be recorded on any of the six Moon mission flights.  Although highly technical in scope, showing exquisite details of the Lunar Module's' flight and various control systems, it is well worth the time to watch.

If nothing else, watching this DVD, you'll come to learn and appreciate the meticulous planning, followed by nearly a decade of development and testing that went into the Apollo program; a monumental project that consumed ~10 billion dollars in NASA funding throughout the 1960s; all to finally realize the almost unimaginable vision of JFK and the will of American taxpayers.

The story of Apollo 11 told in this DVD's many hours of raw, unedited film footage, taken in large part by the Astronauts themselves, is of simply the most significant engineering feat in human history and fascinating from start to finish.",1147392000,2,1672,4.9288256227758005
1896824,5,B00009XYYF,"This DVD set shows EVERYTHING the networks covered and whole lot more. If you are a big fan of the Space Race and the Apollo program, you will love it. Otherwise, it can be very boring at times for those who like to see action, action, action only.",1142899200,,248,4.1875
1896825,4,B00009XYYF,"This is a great set of DVD's for those who would enjoy watching raw footage from the Apollo 11 mission. There are some long slow sections with little commentary, but these are frequently followed by intense moments during the launch, lunar landing and takeoff, and reentry. The scenes shot on the Moon really make you feel as though it's happening now, and while they run pretty long, the effect, if you stick it out, is almost surreal. It's as though you are right there with Armstrong and Aldrin, sharing in all the little, unnerving glitches that demonstrate that this was indeed a stunning human endeavor.

I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the magnitude of this achievement and would like to relive it.",1142726400,,716,4.821138211382114
1896826,4,B00009XYYF,"This whole series from the NASA archives (and I'll review the entire series, not just the Gemini set, since they all pretty mcuh take the same approach) are fascinating only if you are serious devotee of the space program. They are in many cases virtually raw footage from the flights and include plenty of dead air, clicks and beeps and in some cases inane narration by a NASA films employee from back in the day.

Many in the series, especially the Gemini Series, include narrationless launches from different angles and distances. Over and over and over in some cases.

Still, if you want to see and hear EXACTLY what happened on these flights, without editing, interruptions by Walter Cronkite or any other distractions, they are a wonderful and important addition to your library. As a true space program fan, I found them great as pieces of history, if nothing else.

For instance, have you ever wondered what happened AFTER Neil Armstrong took his first step on the Moon? The Apollo 11 set includes film and audio for every minute of every EVA, and you can supposedly switch views from one camera to another, although I have not been able to get that function to work for me.

The Apollo 11 set is also a great companion piece to a book like ""First Man,"" the new biography of Armstrong, which goes into minute detail of each EVA. Being able to synch that up to real footage you'd never find in a Discovery Channel, NOVA or National Geographic DVD is good stuff.

Finally, there are comprehensive post-mission interviews with the crews of these flights, usually backed by footage from the flight itself. The style of interviewing is almost quaint, with such carefully crafted answers from the astronauts, and a generally respectful press gallery. Oh the good old days...

Each set includes three well labeled DVDs that break the missions up chronologicaly. Overall, I say this is a valuable collection of history for a serious NASA afficionado, but at $35 a piece, don't expect the casual fan to enjoy it much.",1141084800,3,2016,4.778735632183908
1896827,5,B00009XYYF,"I've been waiting for this for a long time. This is like owning a piece of history. If there were VCR's at the time, this is what you would have wanted to capture. But now you can own it in all of its DVD splendor. Excellent narration when needed, you'll learn stuff you probably never knew.

1896828,3,B00009XYYF,"I just finished ""To the Moon"" a (NOVA) documentary which I suggest be your first choice, But.. this one was good, for a 1 hour education on the history behind rocket flight up to the Saturn V and the moon landing of Apollo 11. Discusses  Wernher von Braun and the Mercury and Gemini programs as well. It has historical value in some of its non standard footage that other videos don't have i.e.( showing mockup hardware and landing tests on a miniture LEM.) The DVD name is misleading as the Apollo 11 portion is only about 1/5 of the video and the narrator seems to be unfamilar with the astronauts names.

Any old DVD will do but if you want to see complete, uncut footage of the launch, journey, both EVA's from multiple angles, the TV transmissions, 70 and 16 mm films and the Haselblad stills, get this set.
Everyone has seen the B&W grainy shots of the first step but few have seen the super clear, color films of the step shot from the LEM window by Buzz. I certainly haven't. This set has multiple angle selections to choose from, multiple audio tracks to choose from and other special DVD features seldom found. It's the 1st time I have been able to use the ""angle"" button on my remote.
To look at it another way, each disc has at least 2, and usually 5 angles to choose from so really this set could be described as being 15 discs, not 3. There is one drawback, trying to decide what angle to watch. I found myself switching from angle to angle trying to choose the best.
This is a sweet DVD set you don't want to miss.
You can sit and watch the launch from T-Minus 49 minutes to T + 3 min. with several KSC cameras.
Launch film I have never seen and believe me, I have searched and seen a lot.
You will have hours of great watching with this set.
You need to be an Apollo geek, though. This is unedited video and audio with no talking head commentator interrupting the astronauts.
No editing for dramatic effect.
