1584469,5,B00005JOP6,Release this on DVD - HDDvd if you can swing it. I will pay large for it.,1166486400,15,73,3.3529411764705883
1584770,5,B00005JOP6,"I just recently found out about Sifl and Olly. (When the show originally aired, I didn't have cable.[Not to mention, I was younger then, and probably wouldn't have gotten the humour quite well.])
Well, anyways, after I saw a video of it on YouTube...
I fell in love?
No, maybe that's not the right phrase...
How about...
I really liked it?
That doesn't do it justice.
Well, yeah.
It's really super-special-awesome.
Yeah.",1204761600,,420,4.847222222222222
1584771,5,B00005JOP6,Every moment of watching this show brings more shock at how good it is. My all time favorite show. I bought terrible VHS copies of it on ebay but can not over state how horrible they are; some don't even play. we need good versions of Sifl and Olly. I need the next canadian dracula....,1201996800,,286,4.218181818181818
1584772,5,B00005JOP6,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release this on DVD, all three seasons in a box set if you can swing it. Sifl and Olly was the last (and by far best) thing to come out of MTV that was worth watching. You'll be astounded by the reception the series will receive.",1200441600,4,250,4.122448979591836
1584773,5,B00005JOP6,"I recently tossed VHS copies of the shows recorded off of television because 1. I didn't feel like transferring them to DVD-R and 2. the VHS was pretty worn out anyway.

Whoever is in charge of releasing Sifl & Olly onto DVD needs to do so, needs to make the release all of the shows seasons (however many that is...) and needs to include any and all extra footage available.

I
Loved
This
Show!!

If it gets released I would by several copies (one for myself and several others as presents for friends).

Seriously, we need this, now!!!  Thank You!",1200268800,,549,4.45
1584774,5,B00005JOP6,"I loved this show from the very beginning and I never understood why it didn't get more recognition. The songs they did were so hilarious, every single one of them! Somebody has got to put this on DVD!",1198454400,3,201,4.315789473684211
1584775,5,B00005JOP6,"If you are here, you probably already know just how cresently fresh this show is. So I am only writting this to encourage you to go to the top of the page up there and sign up to be notified if and when this product becomes available. Amazon is more powerful than you may realize, we plus them could get this show released on dvd. ROCK!",1197244800,,336,4.106060606060606
1584776,5,B00005JOP6,"I watched the original episodes - have many of them taped to VHS - in total awe. The Season Three DVD is great and I'd love to have a nicely done package of Season One and Two with input from Matt and Liam. The old S&O web site had a lot of behind the scenes stuff and commentary, so it would take very little effort to produce a completed set. Slap a $9.99 price tag on it and watch them make a resurgence!! You can't stop the crescent freshness!!!",1195603200,4,449,4.056179775280899
1584777,5,B00005JOP6,"I was recently emailed a youtube clip with Liam Lynch's ""My United States of Whatever"" and was instantly hooked on him.  Then I researched his bio on Wikipedia, where it mentions his friend Matt Crocco, as well. THEN I saw the mention of the Sifl and Olly show, and found some episodes on youtube.  I never realized that they were on MTV, since I have not watched in since 1985 when it was still half-way decent. These seem to be mostly from 1998.

However, they are extremely talented individuals, and so out there, off the hook and original, and I am glad I stumbled across such a great find.  Please get these on DVD like the other reviewers have mentioned.

I would buy them a a minute.  Thanks",1172448000,6,698,4.4140625
1584778,5,B00005JOP6,"Sifl & Olly represents everything original and good that made MTV what it is. The idea that MTV bailed on it is outragous, and the thought that it is unavailable to own is heartbreaking. I mean, a show that has an entired cast of sock puppets, and yet manages to stay fresh, satyrical, and fun is amazing. In a culture that has turned it's back on originality, wouldn't it be nice to sit back and enjoy a Guns and Roses parody video performed by two sock puppets? Not only would it be great, it would be ""crescent fresh""!",1170979200,16,521,4.326530612244898
1584779,5,B00005JOP6,"This show was completely underrated. I know there are a lot of people out there who thought this show was boring, dull, stupid, etc... But then there are people like me, who absolutely LOVED it. It was short-lived, but the shows that did air were great. I hope that this gets released on DVD, because I will pre-order every episode the day they become available. Those who loved the show will agree, we miss these guys a whole bunch.",1168819200,23,433,4.493670886075949
7942151,5,B00005JOP6,"I want these on DVD super bad. I bought a horrible quality VHS copy taped by some Ebay seller who recorded straight from MTV. I paid a lot of money for this 10 years ago. Sifl & Olly running constantly in the background helped me survive all night projects. These upstanding puppets are responsible for my college graduation and I owe them, big time.

MTV - Release These.",1334620800,,372,4.470588235294118
7942152,5,B00005JOP6,"This TV show is 12 years old and the original creators of this show want to sell it, the fans want to buy it, and yet here we are 12 years later and no DVD.
Most fans that want these shows have found the old transcoded VHS recordings and can watch them anytime they want, and yet fans are on here trying to give MTV money, and MTV would rather people pirate it than make money off legitimate DVD sales.

Ok MTV, you can't be bothered with creating a DVD, then sell it on iTunes or Amazon Digital.  This is a prime example of what's wrong with current copyright law, if it wasn't for the pirated versions, this show would have been lost to time, thanks for nothing MTV.

As far as the show goes, if you like not being able to tell what's going to happen next, this is the show for you.  It's original and funny.",1330819200,,810,4.1075949367088604
7942153,5,B00005JOP6,im so glad that im not the only one that remembers this show. i really wish they would make this into a dvd as they finally did daria. -True 90's superstar,1296604800,,155,4.032258064516129
7942154,5,B00005JOP6,"Come on people, let's start making waves over this. I'm tired of everyone just whining about it and never actually DOING anything. Let's at least start a petition or a letter writing campaign. Let's bug Liam Lynch with constant phone calls and emails reminding him that this was his greatest achievement and if he abandons it it would be a crime.  MTV has some bizarre criteria for releasing their older hits on DVD, but if raising enough of a holler worked for The State(which I bought the day of release) it can certainly work for Sifl & Olly. The fan base is huge, we just need to make ourselves more vocal.",1264291200,,610,4.495495495495495
7942155,5,B00005JOP6,"PLEASE put these DVDs for sale! This is one of the funniest television shows I have ever watched. I really really really don't want to suffer the poor quality of pirated internet episodes! I will pay, MTV! I WILL PAY! It's like they're holding them ransom FOR NO REASON",1260316800,,269,4.510204081632653

7942157,5,B00005JOP6,"This is by far the best show MTV ever made and my favorite show period.  it was consistently the highest rated show in its time slot when it originally aired, but the suits at MTV didn't promote it and for some unknown reason kept moving it around and eventually made them include music videos in the episodes. we neeeeeeed this on dvd. or vhs, or betamax, i don't care. i just need a clean copy.",1247616000,,396,4.28
7942158,5,B00005JOP6,"PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD! Sifl and Olly is a fantastic, hilarious and underrated show. There is a huge following behind this show that would pay big money for it all on DVD...oh yes.",1242777600,,184,4.4411764705882355
7942159,5,B00005JOP6,"I can't believe it's been 10 years and this show has yet to be released on DVD.  MTV needs to get off their butts or yield their license to someone who cares or just wants to make money.  I bought some really crappy VHS versions of this show for like $40 back in '01 or so, so you KNOW I'd plunk down $25 for a good print.  How am I supposed to get to ""Llama School"" or remove stains from my ""Prostitute Laundry"" without them?!",1242604800,6,427,4.0
