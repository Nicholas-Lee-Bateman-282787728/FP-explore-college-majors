I have been off my CPAP machine for over a month now, and still finding ways to be amazed at this incrediblly simple but powerful program.  Thanks.",1295049600,8,277,4.372549019607843
3920884,5,B002F6AN9U,"For asthma sufferers, this is a great resource.  Not only does it provide a detailed book regarding the Buteyko Breathing Method, it also has a DVD showing you how to do these exercises and why.  It is the next best thing to seeing a Certified Buteyko Educator if you are too far away from the closest one.  There are approximately 34 Certified Buteyko Educators in North America so they are stretched thin.  This book and DVD set is a godsend for those suffering from asthma and other related breathing difficulties.  The Buteyko Breathing Method is an amazing drug free way to improve your breathing and your health.",1258934400,8,618,4.738317757009346
3920885,2,B002F6AN9U,I bought this and the DVD won't play on my computer or my xbox.. have yet to try a traditional DVD player but im guessing it won't work..  also the CD sounds like a recording of a seminar but it starts not at the beginning.. I haven't read everything but imnot happy.,1256428800,5,267,4.134615384615385

8368826,2,B002F6AN9U,I was so looking forward to watching the video but none of my three DVD players (one is brand new) can read the disk. Had them send me another one. SAME THING. Such a disappointment. I do enjoy the book and CD though.,1482019200,,217,4.069767441860465
8368827,5,B002F6AN9U,This method really works,1433894400,,24,5.25
8368828,5,B002F6AN9U,"This is well worth your time and money to investigate this method.  Although I am only a borderline asthmatic, I found the information and exercises improved my breathing and allergies.  I am also hoping that my Raynauds improves as more oxygen reaches my hands.",1432598400,2,262,4.931818181818182
8368829,2,B002F6AN9U,Rather expensive for simply video taped class room lessons. I hope it's not all about the money here with Buteyko. Strange that simple lessons are almost not available for free on the internet.,1423699200,,193,4.878787878787879
8368830,1,B002F6AN9U,"Don't waste your money on this product.  Just as other reviewers comment, I found the CD defective.  PLEASE DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME,  THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE PRODUCT DEFECT NOT, NOT I REPEAT, THE CONTENT OR THE BUTEYKO METHOD) I found the CD video seminar was very poor quality along with being defective -- choppy, stalled out completely, or had video with no audio at all or audio was not synced to the video.  Very frustrating.  Definitely not worth the 41.93 I paid for it.  The book ""Close Your Mouth"" (that came with this purchase) can be purchased for around $7.50 here at Amazon and there is a whole lot of Patrick McKeown on youtube (playlist around 18 and some look like the ones that are on this CD though I couldn't watch the ones on the CD).  So I'm returning this product and ordering a book and watching youtube.  To reiterate, I hold a lot of hope for the Buteyko Method.  I found it on youtube and have watch several sessions (another author) and started practicing some of what I learned with GREAT SUCCESS.  I have COPD and according to my doctor last week, the medical treatment for COPD is pretty much the same as asthma.  I'm very anxious to learn more, but this DEFECT CD did not help me in any way. UPDATE: The seller promptly answered my return request. The Amazon Marketplace seller offered to replace my CD with a pre-tested CD and also provide a web link to the CD seminar.  Thumbs up to this Amazon Marketplace Seller and thumbs up, as always, to Amazon.com for providing such an outstanding consumer outlet.  I will be returning the product.",1346457600,7,1572,4.531914893617022
8368831,1,B002F6AN9U,"I am eager to start learning this method, and the book helps.
HOWEVER< THE DVD""S DON""T PLAY AND I CAN'T GET A HOLD OF THE CLINIC TO TALK WITH SOMEONE.",1340582400,2,150,4.033333333333333
8368832,5,B002F6AN9U,"Wow, I reviewed this right after I had an asthma attack, wished I had seen this before. I was doing everything wrong-on the first day I watched that DVD three times, practicing over and over. I think this will help me a lot. Thank you so much.",1333238400,3,243,4.191489361702128
8368833,5,B002F6AN9U,Excellent book and dvd instruction. The buteyko method takes some work but the results are amazing. This treatment method should be taught to all asthmatics from the day they are diagnosed.,1313452800,2,189,5.129032258064516
8368834,5,B002F6AN9U,This is an easy to understand intro to Buteyko breathing with a variety of methods to  accomplish the training.,1312416000,2,111,4.842105263157895
