3503383,5,B001C0NMUW,"Crunch Yoga is my new favorite workout.

At first, I had to watch it through and then I had to remind myself to be patient w/myself b/c I just wasn't getting it.

Now I love it; Bethany is a reassuring instructor who's obviously done this before. I like that she keeps telling you that your poses don't have to be perfect, just perfect for you.

There is also a person who modifies the poses, which is very helpful.

This DVD has really made me appreciate and embrace yoga and that's due to the instructor; I wish they were all like her.",1237420800,3,537,4.287128712871287
3503384,3,B001C0NMUW,"It is OK, the pose is not that difficult. However, watching the DVD and doing at the same time is not easy. I twisted my muscle and got hurt.
Since then I never used it. Maybe I never done Yoga before, if you have had done before, you would not have any problems.",1236384000,,263,3.981132075471698
3503385,5,B001C0NMUW,Finally someone got it right.  I have about a dozen yoga DVD's at home and this is by far the best.  Bethany Lyons really takes you through all the steps for a great workout. She is a great teacher and brings a whole new concept and energy to my Yoga workout.  I can't wait for her next one.,1226188800,4,291,3.9827586206896552
3503386,5,B001C0NMUW,"I'm really getting the hang of Yoga now; I never really liked it before until recently and this is another great workout to add to my fast growing collection of Yoga workouts.  I like Crunch and guessed that this might be another good dvd and luckily I was right.
It is more geared for the beginner to intermediate, so I found it non-intimidating and not so hard to do.  Bethany is a good instructor and she's friendly and encouraging.  She lets you know that it's OK if you don't quite get the moves down perfectly - there are options if need be.  I find that very appealing because I sometimes feel like I HAVE to get it right and her saying that, makes me relax more.  It's a workout more geared towards core and lower-body, and you get a fantastic stretch at the end.
If you normally would pass on Yoga, do give this a try.  I always found it 'difficult' and while it isn't always easy, this is a great way to begin and before you know it, you'll find the moves easier and easier and then you'll be ready to try more difficult routines.  This is definately a good place to start and I highly recommend it.",1224460800,28,1109,4.277511961722488
3503387,5,B001C0NMUW,"got my heart rate up and broke a sweat. felt great after and also great for beginners that are new to yoga. Easy to follow the instructor, upbeat and fun!",1391731200,,154,4.166666666666667
3503388,2,B001C0NMUW,"Compared to other yoga/Pilates videos I have done (with Ellen Barnet) this video was okay.  The positions were good, but she often doesn't explain the next step well so I found I need to constantly look up.  I am a beginner at yoga and most moves were basic, but a few were difficult or not well explained.  Either way I lost interest in this video and prefer others.",1384214400,,367,4.367647058823529
3503389,4,B001C0NMUW,"It feels like a good introduction/intermediate workout. It's a short but satisfying practice, clocks in at 40mins. I found this when searching for flow yoga dvds and I can see why. The approach towards the middle and end of the DVD is flow style, or Vinyasa Yoga, which incorporates sun saluation sequence in quick succession and movements. The teacher encourages you to move at your own pace, first doing the series at a gentle and slow pace, but steadily moving into a faster flow. You do two flow series after the sun salutations warm-up, which you run through twice, at the end of the workout there is an awesome hip opener stretches and relaxation. The relaxation is not radical, no heavy breathing techniques, the teacher simply guides you to relax your body for a few minutes. I truly enjoyed the relaxation at the end, and if you are into deep mediation you can use that time during the workout to do so, but oddly the relaxation was the best part of the workout-- quite a few times I dosed off or completely melted away.

Example Moves:
Warrior 1
Warrior 2
Boat pose
Cobra
plank
chatranga
upward and downward facing dog
piegon hold
Chair pose",1374796800,4,1151,4.642156862745098
3503390,5,B001C0NMUW,Good workout and yoga in one. Less than an hour but feels like a real yoga practice and power workout,1372982400,,101,4.1
3503391,5,B001C0NMUW,"I am new to yoga, but I found this to be a great workout.  Bethany is very calming and does a great relaxation bit at the end.  It did take me a few times to get down some of the moves and poses, but I feel more confident now an I've only gone through the DVD about five times.  Love this yoga practice.",1369180800,,303,3.7777777777777777
3503392,4,B001C0NMUW,"I'm 58 years old, this is good program to follow, it's not difficult.  The instructor  explains in detail each move.",1367712000,,116,4.75
3503393,5,B001C0NMUW,"I've had this video for three years and I've loved it since day one ! It's not so much for beginners, especially if this is the very first yoga video you've ever tried. But it's not terribly hard either, if you stick to doing it at least 3 - 5 times a week I promise you will see results ! You will be more toned and have a clearer mind ! I love this video, highly recommend it !",1366329600,,379,3.810126582278481
3503394,5,B001C0NMUW,"I have a few Crunch DVDs and am so glad I added this to my collection. Bethany Lyons is a great instructor. She moves at a good pace, gives modifications and encourages you to challenge yourself.

I love the relaxation at the end.",1366156800,,230,4.348837209302325
3503395,3,B001C0NMUW,"It is nice for relaxation but do not expect a great workout out of it. I use it after my regular workout for stretching, cooling down and relaxing. Nice instructor.",1360022400,,164,4.5
3503396,1,B001C0NMUW,Bethany Lyons' incessant talking was too much for me. This DVD is going straight in to the garbage. It is nothing at all like the Yoga Sculpt actually taught at Crunch gym. It is slow and boring.,1357430400,,195,4.297297297297297
3503397,3,B001C0NMUW,"the teacher talks a little fast.  I like my Sarah Ivanho's one's better.
Wouldn't buy another from her. Won't use this one much.",1356393600,,128,4.565217391304348
3503398,5,B001C0NMUW,I'm a beginner and love this video. It's 45 minutes of a full body workout. Great on the core. Even just a few minutes of it is worth it.,1355356800,,137,3.7586206896551726
3503399,5,B001C0NMUW,Video is great. I felt every muscle in my body worked and elongated after just one workout. It's amazing! :),1334620800,,108,4.45
3503400,4,B001C0NMUW,"This is definitely not a beginner DVD as it is too fast-paced and in some sections moves too quickly for a person who is more inflexible. With that caveat in mind, it is an enjoyable, well-cued easy to follow intermediate DVD with a friendly, but knowledgable instructor who makes it easy to follow. Bethany seems in this DVD to be athletic and fitness oriented, but her training in yoga is evident also. The women in the DVD who modifies the poses makes the workout doable for those who may be intermediate exercisers, but are less flexible in some areas. I have many yoga DVD, and surprisingly enough, this is one of the best I have found. It is just the right touch for those days when you may want somewhat of a challenge, without going full speed ahead.",1308700800,,758,4.5
3503401,3,B001C0NMUW,"This DVD is not for your absolute ground level beginner. I keep having to look up at the TV to see where she is, which causes me to slow down and lose my place in the flow parts. She moves too fast for an utter novice like me. I can see liking this video after I get a little stronger and a little more familiar with yoga, but I'm going to need something slower and easier for starters.",1299024000,7,386,3.9615384615384617
3503402,5,B001C0NMUW,"I've honestly never done much yoga because I always thought it was a little boring, but when I decided to give it another try, I wanted a slightly easier DVD to experiment with.  ""Crunch: Yoga Body Sculpt"" was the perfect DVD to try because it was fun, effective, and made me feel fantastic!  It's led by Bethany Lyons, a dramatic yet encouraging instructor who makes the workout a lot of fun.  Like most Crunch DVDs, there is a large background of backup people that are doing yoga along with Bethany, and they are not afraid to hoot and holler during the practice.  This really adds to the fun factor of yoga, I felt, and made it seem less like a ritual and more like a workout.  If you like yoga to be very quiet, though, you might not enjoy this aspect.  One of the backup girls modifies some of the exercisers, so if you are brand new to yoga or just not feeling like pushing yourself, you can follow her slightly easier postures.

Now, you begin the workout with just some deep breaths in a seated position on the floor, some cat/cow stretches, and a modified boat pose.  You then move onto flowing yoga sequences that Bethany does one time slow with you then speeds up for two more times.  The first flowing set of poses is almost exactly a sun salutation, and if you don't know what that is, don't worry, you should be able to follow along by practicing and watching Bethany since she explains and demonstrates everything very well.  Basically, you are required to fold down, get in push up position, and do some other basic things there.  After this series, you do another flowing section that involves some of the same moves.  After those, you move into a crescent section that really works your legs.  This is basically a set of exercises while maintaining a lunge on your leg the entire time; it can be very tough.  Finally, you finish with some stretches and a relaxing, almost-meditation part where you are lying on the floor and you are walked through a section of relaxing your body one body part at a time.

At the end of the workout, I feel relaxed yet energized, toned yet stretched.  In other words, I feel great.  It's a very simple, effective yoga DVD that lasts about 40 minutes and is worth every one of them.  I highly recommend this to all people who enjoy yoga, because I think this DVD throws a fun spin on it that makes it very enjoyable to do.",1297555200,8,2373,4.441108545034642
3503403,5,B001C0NMUW,"This is my favorite yoga DVD.  I would like to find a few more like it to vary my workout!  :)  I have been doing yoga for a couple of years but I think the instructor explains the poses well enough that someone not as familiar with yoga could still do them.  The instructor also offers different variations of some of the poses if you want an easier variant, and there is someone demonstrating those variations.  You feel like you are in a class because there are several other plus the instructor doing the yoga practice.  The workout is about 40 minutes long and includes sun salutations, warrior poses, crescent poses, bridge pose, and others.  A great basic workout with lots of standard yoga poses.  I really like the flow from one pose to the next--you do not spend a lot of time in one pose before you move on.  The pace is fairly quick compared to other yoga videos.  It's easy to work up a sweat and burn some calories and I feel great afterwards.  I feel like it is a workout that works my whole body.",1282867200,5,1012,4.329787234042553
3503404,5,B001C0NMUW,I love yoga and this dvd really gives you a good workout.  It is somewhat difficult but worth the effort.  The more you do it the better you will get at it.  It has become my favorite yoga workout!,1280275200,,197,4.0
3503405,3,B001C0NMUW,"I bought this DVD because the reviews said it was for beginners. I think my problem is that I am SUCH a beginner that I need to look at the tv in order to know what she is talking about. ""Half-way down"" does not mean the same in English as it does in yoga-speak.
After doing this DVD for a month, I have not lost an inch or felt better. Rather, I have excruciating pain in my back, knees, ankles, and wrists. I think I'll stick to basic aerobics.",1277424000,5,446,4.022471910112359
3503406,5,B001C0NMUW,"This is a reasonably easy but still challenging workout with a wonderful teacher.  She guides, has a soothing voice, and popping this in to work out when you can't get to the gym is the perfect solution.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes yoga or is interested in learning the basics before venturing into a class.",1276732800,,331,4.610169491525424
3503407,5,B001C0NMUW,Nice flowing workout. Bethany's instructions are clear and the workout is energizing. Still can't quite swing my right foot (weaker side) through but I've definitely made progress. Wish she'd come out with a new yoga routine.,1269561600,,225,5.277777777777778
3503408,5,B001C0NMUW,"Whenever I want an intensive lower body (yoga or otherwise) workout, I put in this video. Yes, you will also work your core and upper body but the focus of this video are the legs and buns.  This is NOT for beginners and expect to have to watch it a few times before mastering the postures.  This workout will make you sweat and will tone and stretch your body.  It is not divided into chapters like all of the other Crunch videos that I own, so you will have to watch or fast forward through the into.",1263081600,,502,4.154639175257732
3503409,5,B001C0NMUW,I absolutely LOVE this DVD!! I do yoga 2-3 times a week along with cardio and strength training 3-4 times a week. this is just what my body needs to stretch and recover. the cues are easy to follow and Bethany is very pleasant and soothing.,1258243200,2,240,4.239130434782608
3503410,5,B001C0NMUW,"this is my very favorite yoga dvd so far. it gets your heart rate up by using a vinyasa flow, so you burn calories while sculpting your muscles. her workout is very similar to a yoga class i took that i absolutely loved!",1252281600,,220,4.1395348837209305
3503411,5,B001C0NMUW,"I thought it was a great Crunch DVD. Bethany Lyons is such an easy instructor to listen to and take ""cues"" from, as she is not intimindating. I like that you can do this workout and feel immediately refreshed upon finishing, and you can really feel it in your buns and thighs the next day!

**Great poses**
Finishing with hip openers is great, as pigeon is one of my favorites
Great cool-down (shavasayna) and meditation at the end
lots of downward dog with an emphasis on form

Thanks Crunch Fitness for more ""flowing"" yoga workout. Hope to see more to come....",1250899200,7,562,4.554455445544554

3503413,4,B001C0NMUW,"Let me start out by saying that I enjoy this routine, but there are a few cons about it as well. Let's start with the cons, shall we? This is why I would definitely not recommend this DVD to a beginner:

Poor to literally non-existent breathing cues in sections. No emphasis or explanation of ujjayi breathing. The instructor is often sniffing through her nose on the inhale and encouraging you to sigh out of your mouth on the exhale, either by verbally prompting you to do so or constantly doing so herself. (And yet she still manages to call a few poses by their Sanskrit names.)

I'm not sure I like the way that she keeps her palms together during sun salutations and in a few other areas as well. I'm also not sure why she goes to such great lengths to modify and ease you into boat pose, as there are sequences and poses in this routine far more challenging than boat pose.

With that said, I've been doing yoga long enough now that none of this was too much of a bother. I can cue my own breathing, I don't have to modify boat pose, and I can sweep my arms up and down whichever way I want to during sun salutations. I like how the instructor gets right into the practice and never spends much time going into detail about poses, etc.

This is a very nice, lower body focused (hips, buns & thighs) workout.",1244160000,16,1314,4.286290322580645
3503414,5,B001C0NMUW,"Bought this video 3 weeks ago and i have to say i have used it alot more than other workout videos i own. You really work your thighs, butt and abs in this one. Its not a boring workout by any means, plus the instructor is great. Highly recommended!!!",1241913600,,251,4.142857142857143
3503415,3,B001C0NMUW,"Background music is important to me as it sets the tone or mood. I thought it was kind of hard to hear in this workout.  The instructor seems very pleasant, but she she uses the word ""beautiful"" several times - enough that it caught my attention and I wished she'd stop.  Probably not a bad workout, but overall, it just didn't really stand out for me as something I'd want to do over & over.  Since  I have other yoga DVDs that I like much, much better, I won't be keeping this one on my shelf.",1240876800,,495,4.125
