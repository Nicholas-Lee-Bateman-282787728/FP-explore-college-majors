2796921,4,B000OI1JFS,"In my novice opinion this is a good, all Capoeira workout- I've recently been introduced to Capoeira and love the fun, challenging workouts that are part of this beautiful martial art.  This video is a good way to practice what you learn in class - especially for a beginner who is still learning to combine movements.  The workouts are short, but challenging.",1223683200,5,360,4.790322580645161
2796922,5,B000OI1JFS,"One may ask, what is capoeira? I am glad to have found out, now you should too! This is one of the most fabulous exercise &, instructional programs from World Dance New York that I have gladly subjected my body to. I found Capoeria  a playful, skilled dance with martial arts woven in gracefully and sublelty. One may think of martial arts and remember Bruce Lee.; but here comes Paula to put it all together as a fun,intense work out with full benefits in muscle tone, agility,and flexability.
Beginning with the warm-up, this is intense. The program incorporates level changes, kicks, torso rotations, cartwheels. You will feel every muscle in your body claim its name.  The amazing thing is that upon viewing the program initially, one may have the misconception that this program is not for them. Follow through with the warm up and instantly you are hooked. Paula has a way of presenting the warm up that is friendly and inviting and not threatening even for the faithful couch potato.
The technique is explained in sections, then applied in 2 workout sessions; the first section introduces the basics and slow technique, the second workout session applies intense kicks, torso rotations on the floor which are faster paced.
This dvd is rich in content and runs approximately 38 minutes.
Paula and her partners devote a section to explain the use of hand held instruments used in playing the capoeria rhyhtms, a section for exhibition of capoiera games, and then Paula herself in a skillful exhibit of her abilities in capoiera. She is beautiful to watch!
I have been doing some of the capoeira moves only a few days, and found myself applying some of the lunges and torso balancing in my sword dancing with a faster response time. Initally, I did not think I could follow through, the lunges were challenging, but I am glad I did.
I love this program, it is full of benefits that enrich my dance life.",1192233600,9,1907,4.758308157099698
2796923,5,B000OI1JFS,"Me and my husband tried this video for the first time and we loved it!!! Paula Verdino is an amazing instructor who provided clear instructions on the different types of techinques.  I definitely apprecipated the background and history of Capoeira and its music.
The warm up was very good and the workout was intense, even a cave man can do it!  Although the video was short we are hopeful that there will be a series to follow.  This is a great video for beginners, who which to learn more about what makes Capoeira such an amazing sport in Brasil and around the world.",1186531200,16,570,4.514563106796117
2796924,3,B000OI1JFS,"I used to do capoeira for a few years but haven't had time to go to classes for almost a year, so I was very excited to see that this DVD was coming out because I thought it would be a nice way to continue with my practice on my own.  I did it for the first time yesterday, however, and was very disappointed by how short it is.

Although the DVD does start with a review of the basic moves/kicks you'll be doing and a brief history of this martial art, the workout itself is only about 20 minutes long, including the warmup.  There is also no cool-down or stretch at the end.

On the positive side, all of the music is by Mestre Bimba and there are some good sample rodas to watch and learn from.

Overall, it's an alright workout that provides a nice overview of the basic moves (like Beno, Queixada, Martelo, etc.), but I felt like it could have been much longer.",1181779200,51,866,4.161676646706587
2796925,5,B000OI1JFS,"great work out video.
I love dancing, music, and different forms of martial arts. This covers all 3, I love the story behind capoeira too.",1433116800,,138,4.56
2796926,5,B000OI1JFS,Like to watch.  Cannot do it.  LOL,1419552000,,34,3.7142857142857144
2796927,5,B000OI1JFS,Quick delivery and perfect description. Thank you!,1416441600,,50,6.285714285714286
2796928,2,B000OI1JFS,"Not suitable for beginners. The speed at which she teaches technical and difficult moves - this is aimed at people who are learning or have knowledge of Capoeira. As a dancer and teacher, I was frustrated by her speed. Yes it's a work out but perhaps specify it is for intermediate etc.  Or at least have a section aimed at beginners then you can work your way towards the harder level. As a beginner you could seriously injure yourself attempting some of these moves.",1409702400,2,468,4.571428571428571
2796929,4,B000OI1JFS,It was super boring. My lady almost didn't keep watching it. But skipped to the warm up and liked it. But not doing it with anyone at this point... going in alone lol.,1409356800,,167,4.090909090909091
2796930,4,B000OI1JFS,"I have been wanting to start practicing capoeira for a while. This work out is perfect for a beginner, its short and gives you a little history.",1390521600,,144,4.37037037037037
2796931,5,B000OI1JFS,"This is a great workout and you don't have to be a full martial art person to enjoy the benefit of this exercise. It's simple enough and works in all parts of the muscles. Through practise you get the hang of it. It's also educational in music and culture. I like that they have someone slower and bigger to state, size and speed doesn't matter. It's a great cardio. and enough to build strenght and flexibility. I recommend for anyone who wants to just workout for short duration at home and not have to go to a class . Also if you are thinking of doing Capoeira professionally, this video give you a glimsp.",1368144000,3,609,4.350877192982456
2796932,3,B000OI1JFS,"First, this is a good tape, and it's a good introduction to capoeira. I had purchased this as there aren't any capoeira groups near me, and I was missing the movement (so I wasn't going into this hoping for a work out or anything advanced.) I don't know if I'd really call it a work out though. I found myself getting more out of the warm up than the lessons.  The combination moves weren't very vigorous, but they gave you an idea of the movement and it's something to build on.  If you've never come across capoeira before (it seems like a strange thing to pick up randomly through a dvd, but that's just me) than you really need to watch her do the different kicks first. A friend of mine tried the dvd, and was flustered and confused as the work out doesn't give instruction.  It was nice to hear the music though.  Along the lines of its length 27 minutes is being overly generous to the actual time you're moving.",1361318400,4,919,4.325581395348837
2796933,5,B000OI1JFS,I love it. It arrived quick and in tact. The workout is excellent and it is also great if you have new done capoeira and don't have the option of finding a club to attend. Thank you!,1360281600,2,182,3.945945945945946
2796934,5,B000OI1JFS,"MAKE SURE TO DO 10 MINUTES STRETCHING EVERYDAY,  This DVD is great because it shows two other student behind the teacher. One is advanced and the other is a newbie. You can be focused on the newbie and see how she does the moves. After you get pretty good with this DVD then you may do move sequences like the Capoeira players on youtube. Good luck and Salve!  :)",1355097600,2,363,4.246376811594203
2796935,3,B000OI1JFS,I have nothing against women. However this video is hardly a workout video and it is designed at a slower pace to teach women.,1347580800,2,126,4.291666666666667
2796936,3,B000OI1JFS,"I cannot rate on an actual opinion because I have received it, but have not even opened it.  I became too ill to work with it, so it is on hold.",1314576000,,144,3.6451612903225805
2796937,4,B000OI1JFS,Oh how I wish this was a 60 minute dvd.  The actual workout is only 20 minutes.  Not nearly long enough.  But it was intense and fun. Please make more of these world dance new york,1284681600,5,180,3.9444444444444446

2796939,3,B000OI1JFS,It looks like it is a decent workout.  I just didn't have enough floor space in my house to actually do the workout.  Make sure you have enough floor space!,1267574400,12,156,4.166666666666667
2796940,5,B000OI1JFS,This is very innovative and fun!  I'm deployed to Iraq currently and heard about Capoeira while watching a show.  I found this and am very please with the purchase.  It is a very different workout and is something new to learn.  AWESOME!!,1252713600,2,238,4.595238095238095
2796941,5,B000OI1JFS,great to keep me in shape when im not able to attend my capoeira classes,1236643200,2,72,3.8666666666666667
2796942,3,B000OI1JFS,"Instructor did an amazing job explaining the moves in workout #1.  Can't say the same for workout #2.  She just keeps saying ""And go"" - then jumps into a routine.  The workout segments (combined) are much too short.  An added 15-20 mins would have made all the difference.",1231545600,8,272,4.604166666666667
2796943,4,B000OI1JFS,"This is a nice video to learn the culture and basics of capoeira. It's a little above my current fitness level, but it's fun to watch. I recommend it for parents who want to expose their children to the art of capoeira.",1229212800,3,219,4.238095238095238
2796944,5,B000OI1JFS,This is a killer on butt and legs and pretty amazing all-around workout.  I started going back to some yoga and and started Pilates to improve my flexibility and strengthen my lower back which also helped to compliment  this program.  I liked trying something different and will keep it in my workout mix.,1229040000,5,305,4.716981132075472

8185322,4,B000OI1JFS,My new-found passion and a substitute to my cardio sessions. Very informative and I learned the basics after 2 days because of this.,1460505600,,132,4.782608695652174
8185323,5,B000OI1JFS,it was an awesome video that goes to the very heart history and art if Capoeira. I do feel obligated to piint out to those interestedin buying ut that it is not a video for those with limitations on movements. you need a certain amount of flexibility to  participate?,1457654400,,267,4.448979591836735
8185324,5,B000OI1JFS,Wonderful introduction into the very basics of Capoeira. For people who are doing a little yoga or are otherwise working out this is easy to follow and to do. I love this disc and Paula is a very pleasant and elegant teacher. I hope she produces more videos like this one,1439164800,,271,4.333333333333333
8185325,5,B000OI1JFS,Paula is awesome!,1436227200,,17,5.0
8185326,3,B000OI1JFS,"I have practiced Capoeira before so when I saw this video I thought it would provide a conditioning practice useful to the Capoeirista; to be clear, I was not looking for a training video, but rather a workout video that helps you develop the strength needed for engaging in the given practice.  This said the video was not useful to me.  It does not work as a workout video because it is shot as if the instructor was teaching a class and in that case it makes more sense to be a student watching and listening to her commands from behind so that when she shifts the weight between her feet with quickness you can keep up.  Also some of the movements in workout 2 were new to me so it would have been nice to have them broken down.",1435017600,,732,4.214285714285714
