1173027,4,908970938X,"Virtual walks take a lot of the boredom out of regular treadmill walks and, if well-made, also give a realistic impression of sightseeing.  The visual quality of the Philippines walks is excellent and the scenery is vibrant, with fascinating glimpses of everyday life.  The pace is about right, too.  What would make it even better would be if the camera could be panned a little to the left or right now and then, to give us a closer look at features of particular interest or beauty(buildings, gardens, fields etc.) or a view into the distance on either side of us.  After all, a person normally looks around a bit when walking through beautiful countryside!  I found myself desperately wanting to see more of what was passing by on my left or right, but which had already moved off the screen by the time we got close enough to see it.  If remote panning slightly to left or right - so that the road is occasionally on one side of the screen rather than always dead center - is not possible, perhaps stopping every so often to manually pan the camera across the scene would be an option?  Nevertheless, the experience is most enjoyable, especially the village scenes.

1173028,5,908970938X,Bought this in the hope it would help me lose a few pounds. Well so far I love it because I can jog on the spot without getting bored senseless. My wife uses it as well and loves it too. We also loved the fact that this purchase will help the poor folks who have experienced the atrocities of the Philippines weather last year. This is a great concept and we will buy more of the discs too.,1389657600,,390,4.012820512820513

7901649,1,908970938X,After opening this DVD we were shocked and horrified that this DVD was created and sold by the terrorist group ISIS Asia. Do not buy this DVD.,1460764800,,142,4.296296296296297
7901650,5,908970938X,"I own many Virtual Walks DVDs, but this is one of the best. Here you can walk or run through the mountains, you walk through a typical Philippine village where the inhabitants dry rice on the road and in the last video you can walk on the beach. There you jog past mangroves and you can see  a breathtaking sunset. On this DVD nearly everything is represented, you can learn a lot about the island and its people. Here you can see lush green vegetation, inhabitants who are traveling with oxcarts and in video two the bright blue sky is particularly beautiful.  Everything is accompanied by the sounds of nature. With this DVD you have the feeling as if you were on this island. A very nice, very varied DVD. Exercising is just so much more fun. You can also sit on the couch, relax and enjoy the different sceneries.",1433030400,2,817,4.44

7901653,5,908970938X,"Love this walk! I actually used it on my exercise bike & even though it's more for walking, it still worked out well. Such beautiful scenery & all natural sounds. Made time go by quicker on the bike. I also like that you can choose different walks so you can always do something different. Really made exercise more enjoyable! Thanks so much for doing these & I look forward to trying more in the future.

7901654,4,908970938X,"for future production of virtual walking/running/cycling videos, i suggest the camera should also pan at some interesting points along the way. we runners don't mind not looking ahead of the trail once in a while to admire the surrounding view (yeah, we'll still keep on running at the treadmill). there are some places where a runner won't mind stopping for a few minutes just to absorb the beauty of the surroundings. all right, there should be a version for full straight 'horse blinds' and another version of the same route that pans at the sides once in a while.",1412553600,2,567,4.737373737373737
