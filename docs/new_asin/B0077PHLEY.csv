8511994,5,B0077PHLEY,"Although this dvd is entirely black and white, it contains very, very good Gene Autry short movies. If you are a fan of Gene Autry-this dvd is for you, or even old westerns. Love the songs-espically Red River Valley. Can't go wrong with this dvd, and it's not easy to find. Good, clean family entertainment. A lot of Smiley Burnette in them too. Very good buy.",1346716800,,360,4.46969696969697
