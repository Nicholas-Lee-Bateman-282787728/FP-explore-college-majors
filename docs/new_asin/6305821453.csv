1081369,5,6305821453,This is an excellent movie. Johnny To's direction has a understated style which I really liked. It is a story about 5 guy's hired to guard a triad boss who someone is trying to kill. They develop a kind of friendship based on respect. There is some dark humor and a overall sense of reality.  Anthony Wong and Francis Ng give especially noteable performances. The  subtitles are for the most part very good (a problem in a lot of HK  movies). If you enjoy gangster movies with a good plot and excellent acting  you will certainly enjoy this movie.,957225600,2,547,4.494949494949495
1081370,5,6305821453,"I give this five star because I just personally love it. There is a certain overboard in the area of coolness; almost everyone is cool. But the general strong plot+strong photography+strong acting makes it a classic  Hong Kong gun-slinging action film. Most memorable would be the scene when  two sharp-shooters would keep shooting at one another and not move even  though every incoming shot is dangerously close to home; dramatically they  miss one another at the end of a volley of maybe twenty shots. And many  aspects of the story are done without the eztra talk. If it's to be done,  it's done. Certainly signature of a master.
This film won ""Best  Film"" and ""Best Director"" for 1999 in Hong Kong's Film  Reviewers society. Johnnie To won best director in that ""Hong Kong  Oscar"" thing.",957139200,3,792,4.807407407407408
1081371,4,6305821453,"Gee, what can you say about the Hong Kong Cinema without Johnny To's recent works since ""The Longest Night"" and it reaches the zenith with ""The Mission"". It shows to the world that Hong Kong cinema  needs no more car explosion, heavy stunt or self-sacrificial performances  to draw the attention, but a solid story and concrete charactors. The world  depicted in the film is originated in the traditional ways of samurai, in  which people not just loyal to their bosses, but their deed! Yes, it has  the overtone of Kurosawa's films, but still better than always eating the  cheap hollywood elements.... A MUST SEE for anyone intested in the Hong  Kong Cinema.",956620800,3,660,4.839285714285714
1081449,4,6305821453,"I loved the film, but a word of warning about the english subtitles.  The translation is very strange in parts - substitution of completely wrong words with a similar spelling.

They're taut, paced and intelligent sequences. The way the characters all come together to form an elite bodyguard team is handled subtly. But the way friendships are portrayed between cold-blooded killers is portrayed real well.",1060128000,5,373,5.233333333333333

This movie was very surface and never got you in depth enough to know the characters or even care for them. The action was not over the top like I expected or wanted and though there was a couple of neat scenes, not enough for me. My number one problem would be the basic plot that appeared to take no time to write and the only big turn in it was the affair angle. I'd advise you to rent this before you consider buying it, I know I'm glad I did.",1010620800,6,534,3.9537037037037037

Sure it's not completely original; it has elements of La Femme Nikita, The Usual Suspects, and The Professional in it, but it will keep you in suspense from beginning to end. Best of the Hong Kong shoot'em up movies. It is clever, well written and thoughtfull. Visualy stylish without the glamorization of the killer profession. You may want to view some of the scenes twice to realize what just happened. The movie deserved a better musical score but the ending more than makes up for it. Highly recommended!",983577600,2,517,4.7555555555555555
1081453,4,6305821453,"This movie was worth the money, but don't be fooled because it might not be as action packed as most of you are expecting.  Johnny To is a great director and knows how to display a unique sense of style that is really fun to watch.  Francis Ng is one of my favorite actors and his character is really hilarious to watch because he's so serious.

1081454,5,6305821453,"Everyone loves a great shootout in their action film right? How about four to five? Johnny To directs this clever and thoughful film about five men hired to guard a highly-ranked Triad boss. Each man has his own story and thus makes this action film a character driven one as well. Although the film has only 81 minutes to enthrall you, every minute is worth it. The acting, especially Francis Ng's and Anthony Wong's performances are sleek, stylish and humorous. Although the DVD isn't loaded with extras, it's the best format-- especially since the VHS version will have you using magnifying glasses when reading the subtitles. An amazing action film at any rate and a must see for any Hong Kong film fan or pure gangster movie buff.",979257600,12,735,4.75
1081455,5,6305821453,"How can a movie about hitmen and bodyguards be calm and elegant?  I'm not really sure, but watch this great film to see how it's done.
The scene in the closing-down mall is the finest shootout ever put on film.  No OK Corral movie can touch it.  You have to look to ballet to find more grace, power and wit.  But it's still very tough, very edgy.  There are a couple of purely visual moments that describe the evolution of the bodyguards as a team better than any dialogue could.  In particular, the casual office football practice is brilliant.
The acting and characterizations are strong and never flashy.
The music is retro to an American ear, but it suits the film just fine.",979084800,3,679,4.479674796747967
1081456,4,6305821453,"This film is a fresh breath of air, and renewed my faith in the Hong Kong crime thriller genre. I grew up on Hong Kong films, as any other Chinese kid has, and over the years, I've become jaded with the high volume of crap put out by untalented hacks in that industry. This film has a sleek elegance and subtlety that carves into a whole new territory that hasn't been explored before. Hong Kong actions films are generally cheesy, over the top, badly written, badly filmed, and copies each other, not to mention foreign films. This one rises above that mediocrity and despite its low-key attitude, manages to kick some major ass with its realism, superb acting, and wry humor.",978307200,,677,4.603305785123967

Even though other premier directors have  bolted to Hollywood, other HK directors are still on the island cranking  out masterpieces like this one.

7895815,5,6305821453,"1999 was a breakout year for Johnnie To. He started off with the underrated Where a Good Man Goes, but it was the next two films that would help raise his status as an auteur. The commercial success of Running Out of Time was followed by the critical success of The Mission (which was not a commercial success) where he would win best director at the Hong Kong Film Awards, Golden Bauhinia Awards and Golden Horse Film. It follows a pattern of To filming more personal projects which were funded by the more popular fare of his co-owned production company Milkyway. The Mission was invited along with two other To titles to the Berlin Film Festival after Ulrich Gregor saw the film. This led to more Milkyway titles being shown at various cinematic events.

The Chinese title translates to gunfire. I prefer the English title which refers more to the homosocial nature of the team aspects in this film (a theme also explored in other To films like PTU and Exiled). In many ways this was a typical Hong Kong production. It took 18 days to film, cost about 320,000 American dollars (2.5 million HK dollars) to make and there was no script. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but the results were atypical. What was created was an elliptical, sometimes enigmatic yet energetic film about honor and languor among lower triad members. It is among my top 50 Hong Kong movies of all-time.

The film has a simple yet elegant structure to it. You can break it into three acts, but it really consists of a prologue (five minutes), the main act (58 minutes) and a coda (21 minutes; or you can consider this the second act.) There is a prologue which economically shows all five of the main characters who will later be hired as bodyguards. Afterwards there is an interesting use of having the shootout start and background noises in the credits which starts the main mission. Then there is a minor mission as the coda.

The main mission which takes the majority of the film is started when a triad boss Lung (Eddy Ko Hung: The Thundering Mantis) has an attempt on his life by unknown assailants. His brother Frank (Simon Yam: PTU) hires five bodyguards (Curtis: Anthony Wong, Roy: Francis Ng, Shin: Jackie Lui, Mike: Roy Cheung, James: Lam Suet) to protect him. They are basically sequestered until whoever is behind the attempts on Lung is found and removed as a threat. This means hours of just sitting around, playing pranks and doing menial chores like chauffeuring Mrs. Lung. This is most exemplified by the most famous scene where the bodyguards kick a paper ball back and forth to each other while waiting for Mr. Lung. It writes banal but it comes across as exhilarating as the chatter between Vincent and Jules in Pulp Fiction (itself a scene reminiscent of Shoot the Piano Player). The scenes of boredom reminds me of pertinent aspects of several jobs that are rarely filmed such as police officers, private investigators where you have hours of tedium sometimes followed by intense life-and-death activities like the assassination attempts in this film.

Small spoilers ahead in this paragraph: Surprisingly the mission is wrapped up quicker than you might realize. However, this leads to the coda where their codes of work and honor will be tested. To had two different endings for the film. The bleak ending was not used because the past several post-handover films from Milkway like The Longest Nite and Expect the Unexpected had doleful endings. He wanted to make his films lighter.

This is a must watch for not just Hong Kong film fans, but anyone who studies cinema as well. Fans of action might be put off by the static compositions and use of lethargic pacing. Tos mix is akin to combining John Woo and Michelangelo Antonioni. Where else do you see jianghu (literally translated as rivers and lakes but it is an idiom that means the fictional universe inhabited within a wuxia or gangster movie) concepts mixed with malaise? But with this film To showed that he was an auteur and a brilliant one at that who could mix a variety of seemingly incompatible influences into a genre film and create one of the unique films of the era. If there is a weakness to me it is the soundtrack. Sometimes the minimalist electronic beats are effective and sometimes it comes off as reminiscent of the computerized scores prevalent in the 1980s though sometimes the beat is strangely catchy. It is but a small flaw. The acting is superb with the intense Francis Ng among my favorites here. The cinematography has been dissected and rightly heralded by critics. Since it carries many Tos trademarks it helps to view this film more than once or at least pay strict attention while watching it. Plot points are alluded to and rarely repeated more than once. It is a challenging work and it is no wonder that this film continues to be among the top Chinese languge lists.

I always find cinematic connections fascinating and this film is abundant with these allusions. To has stated I was under the influence of Akira Kurosawa when I was shooting The Mission. You can see it in Tos use of the vertical wipe as well as the use of camera movement.* Stephen Teo documents a lot of them in his monograph on Johnnie To in the book Director in Action. But you can also see the influence of Takashi Kitano on him as well especially in Sonatine. You can see this less explicitly in the torture scene (one of the most disturbing scenes in Sonatine to me was when the gangster was drowned by being left in the water too long, you do not get to see the result of what happens to analogous character in this film right away though another example of Tos use of elliptical technique), but much more explicit on the Tsuen Wan Shopping Mall shooting scene which paralleled the laconic and Spartan bar shootout in Sonatine which almost looks like a Civil War standoff. The gangster malaise seen throughout this movie in common with Kitano is also familiar to fans of French auteur Jean Pierre Melville another big influence on To and John Woo.** The split screen scene is most likely influenced by the split-screens used in Norman Jewisons The Thomas Crown Affair which also was the basis of Tos 2004 film Yesterday Once More.

This OOP Mei Ah R1/NTSC copy is interlaced and the picture quality suffers a bit. The darks tend to be too dark. I am sure this is just a port from the laserdisc. There are three sets of subtitles: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English. The English subs are pretty good. The two audio tracks are Cantonese and Mandarin with either Dolby Digital or Dolby Digital Surround 5.1. There is a trailer for the film (strangely has some scenes sped up) and one trailer for Ringo Lams Victim (1999). The only other extras under the hilariously titled Data Bank are a Synopsis and Cast & Crew in both Chinese and English.

* Akira Kurosawa loved using the vertical wipe as a transaction for small shifts in time while he would use the fade for longer periods of time. His use of excess amounts of rain in scenes is well known and influenced many Hong Kong directors. You would find countless influences in works by Johnnie To and John Woo.

** I find it fascinating that all three of those directors (Woo, To and Melville) have stated that they prefer and understand directing mens character and have trouble with womens characterizations. All three also have similarities where they deal with gangsters codes of conduct. To and Woo are both fans of musicals and have wanted to direct one.",1432166400,,7496,4.694296577946768
7895816,5,6305821453,My wife and I first saw this film in 2001 at the Maine International Film Festival.  It was a fantastic film of the triad-style that blends contemplative and action sequences in a beautiful narrative about friendship and betrayal.

7895817,5,6305821453,"i love,love this movie. not to be prejudicial but this is a GUY`s movie(i would like to think women can enjoy this but they can be put off by the lack of women & the subtle world of Hong Kong gangster code implied by the characters).

The twist that makes this movie is a friendship created through survival that is put to the test. How the test is resolved is the key to the the magic of this movie. The anticipation to see how it would all be resolved...& joy at the cleverness(a hollywood ending common in the 80s) that the director pulled off to finish the movie.

just watching it now & almost every 2 yrs & so this is my 30th time. each time i watch this movie, i see things that i didn't notice before. this movie is like fight club; there are a lot of hidden meanings that are conveyed by the actors via LOOKS or facial expressions but not  words or dialogue in fight club. And this is where this movie shines-the lack of dialogue doesnt mean nothing is being said but you must really watch the facial expressions as they complete the dialogue or facial says it all. But most north american audience need to have it spelled out...& that``s fine. i was like most north american but this movie taught me the joy of watching for clues that foreshadow the story or outcome and johnny to is fantastic in this regard(watch `breaking news` which is similar but has more dialogue but movie is quite similar in acting style).

Johnny to`s style of directing is what i thought michael haenke of cache would be like but Mr To is so much better. More menacing. the only negative is the music or score. very cheesy sounding keyboards which should be updated or  replaced completely.

honestly, i wish that this movie & tampopo get a better treatment for release. I have this as a transfer from a laserdisc which looks great on analog tv & subtitles were fine until the last leg where there was 1-2 typos. So i sympathize with other reviewers who got lousy copies. but i guess this movie didn't do well enough to fund an update

this is what scorcese should adapt if he wants to win another oscar.

ps: i saw this movie bec i read positive reviews on amazon in 2005 & so returning the favor with this review. hope that it helps..",1346716800,,2223,4.365617433414044

There is nothing to like about this film which is why I am amazed that anyone enjoyed this film.

Stick to John Woo flicks if you wanna see a real action movie worthy of high praise because this film is certainly not worth any of the praise it has received.",1301961600,,576,4.364485981308412

7895821,5,6305821453,"First off, let's start with the negative, which is the actual DVD presentation itself.  Unfortunately, as of this posting, you are not likely to find a 'good' copy of this movie on DVD.  Just about every copy out there has some type of major flaw.  Most look as if they're simply transfers from VCD's, meaning the picture is of a poor resolution on par with a VHS.  The picture is not formatted for widescreen, although it does have black bars top and bottom.  Most discs will have a burn or watermark in the image of the distributor's name or of their logo, most noticeable when the screen is very dark (but you will get used to it after a few minutes).  The subtitles come and go as fast as I've ever seen them.  This is a good choice if you want to learn to speed read.  The sound is fairly abysmal, despite saying it's of the 5.1 variety (although I couldn't decipher much 'actual' surround on my system).  It sound more like plain old stereo.  The menu even looks as if it was made on a home PC.  And yes, the music is a love-it-or-hate-it, very cheesy synth score that sometimes feels like it's on a permanent loop.  After a while it will fade into the background, I promise.  But, if you can look past these aesthetic flaws, you're in for one fantastic film.

To appreciate a Johnnie To film is to first understand what it isn't.  If you're idea of HK cinema (or what you're looking for) consists of John Woo and Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam directing actors who fly through the air whilst mowing down wave after wave of men in the most highly choreographed way possible and cameras that fly around the sets, Johnnie To is not for you.  Although he does have 'action' scenes in his movies and he does shoot in a very stylistic way, I would hardly call his films action movies.

Trailers for his films, especially The Mission, Exiled, and PTU, will give you the impression that these films are action bonanzas.  They are not.  In The Mission, there are 3 major actions sequences.  But, ironically enough, despite being shootouts, most of the people in these scenes don't really move very much.  No spinning, flying through the air, 2-gun, hailstorm of lead types of scenes (which I LOVE, BTW-but these aren't that).  These action scenes are meant to create tension and develop character.  If you watch closely, the way that the characters react to these scenes will give you deep insight into their character.  Most people who feel that these characters are shallow were probably looking for them to ""dialogue"" about themselves more.  In fact, there's very little dialogue in this film.

What makes this film great is the way that the characters interact with one another, the way we learn about them through their mannerisms, style of dress, fighting style, etc. . .  Even though the characters didn't say much, I felt like I knew more about them than most other action/thriller characters.

Also, the story is fantastic.  It seems straight forward, but with Johnnie, it rarely is.  He puts little things here and there than keep a story from every being a point a to b type of film.  It all builds to a payoff that I felt was very much worth it.  This film should be viewed more as something like ""The Departed"" or ""The Usual Suspects"".  Sure, those movies had lots of guns and gangsters, but they didn't have much action.  Character and story drove those movies forward.  I think people let the 'Hong Kong' moniker taint their expectations.

The bottom line is that if you're looking for a solid crime drama, with storytelling that's more visual and artistic and creative than the standard fare, with interesting characters, great style, and a very solid story, this is a fantastic pick, as well as To's Exiled (my personal favorite of his) Election 1 and 2, and PTU.",1216339200,5,3771,4.592814371257485
