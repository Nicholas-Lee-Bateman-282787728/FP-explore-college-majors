4485244,5,B004W48KKM,"I loved the Poky Little Puppy books when I was little, so when my mom found this at a store one day, she bought it for my then-18 mo old daughter. My daughter loved it do much she wore out the DVD and I repurchased it from Amazon. It is a cute cartoon with 3 different choices - The Poky Little Puppy, The Saggy Bsggy Elephant, and Scuffy the Tugboat. Each character's segment is 25 minutes long, and there are 5 minute segments within each larger segment. So, there are 5 stories within each character's segment. My daughter loves this movie and watches at least 1 segment daily. There are good lessons for kids on sharing, friendship, helping others, etc. I highly recommend it!",1394150400,3,680,4.491935483870968
4485245,5,B004W48KKM,I got this for my grandson along with the Poky plushie and a couple of books.  He LOVES this dvd.  It's a nice mix of Poky stories and more classic golden book stars.  Very happy with this purchase.,1390435200,,198,4.157894736842105

The length of the movie is good and I like that it also has other movies on it.",1376784000,,165,3.611111111111111
4485247,4,B004W48KKM,"I got this for my son because the Poky Little Puppy was my favorite when I was growing up, but he is stuck of Cars, Cars 2, Maters Tall Tales.",1370736000,,142,3.7666666666666666
4485248,4,B004W48KKM,"I feel a little weird rviewing a children's dvd, but here goes. My son loves it. He's 2 at the time of my writing this and this is one of his favorites. He likes the ""Poky"" and ""Scuffy"" cartoons but not the ""Saggy Baggy Elephant"" ones. Well I guess I should back up a bit. The video is in 3 sections. One section is a series of cartoons featuring the ""Poky little puppy"", one for ""Scuffy the tugboat"" and one for ""the saggy baggy elephant"".

Now these are not the old golden books brought to life, but a series of cartoons based on the characters from those books. The animation is good, sort of like a stylized children's book. The stories themselves are of the moral/ teaching a lesson variety.

Bottom line, son loves it, I don't hate it, that's good enough.",1355011200,,761,4.352112676056338
4485249,5,B004W48KKM,"When I ordered this item, I thought  was ordering a ""Little Golden Book"" for my grandson.  When it arrived, I found I had ordered a DVD of the POKEY LITTLE PUPPY""!  It was a mistake on my part that I welcomed because I didn't know this DVD existed.  This particular little story was a favorite of my daughter's when she was growing up  and now my grandson can enjoy it too in a different version.  I'm very pleased.",1353283200,,415,4.256410256410256
4485250,5,B004W48KKM,I borrowed this video from the library and just had to buy my own.  My 18 month old son loves it!  The stories are just like the illustrations in the book which makes it very cute.  The story is easy for the kids to follow and short enough to keep their interest.  There is a cute intro song for each book- which my son loves and dances around the room.  I wish there were board books of this series but he'll be ready for real books soon.  It'll be nice to get the books to accompany the video.  It's a great buy for the number of stories included.,1344988800,,549,4.027777777777778

8444380,2,B004W48KKM,I got this to replace a VHS tape that I had when I was young for my daughter who loves watching Poky. This was not like the VHS at all. The cartoons are short and pretty boring. Not at all what I expected.,1476057600,,205,3.7906976744186047

more like a cartoon.",1470096000,,138,3.892857142857143
8444382,1,B004W48KKM,My two year old grandson was bored. There are many short stories about friendship which are good but overall this one is really dated and was not the same content I remembered from the past. Read carefully the description because it is more like cartoons.,1449360000,,255,4.688888888888889
