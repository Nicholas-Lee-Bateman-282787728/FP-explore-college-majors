8294689,5,B001DSDQUO,"If you do jiu jitsu, mma or are interested in self defense, you need to grab a partner and start working on the techniques shown in these DVDs. Excellent quality on all discs.  The grimaces, grunts, and excessive tapping of Tony's demo parter Big Bruce are legendary and worth the price of the discs on their own.",1332979200,,313,4.491228070175438
8294690,5,B001DSDQUO,"This is a very good course on American Catch Wrestling.  Tony explains all the subtleties and demonstrates each technique multiple times.  There is so much information packed on this CD set that I will be continually referring to it as I progress in my grappling skills.

The first half of the third CD is almost inaudible due to a defect in the mastering process.  This is very unfortunate because otherwise this set is first rate.  My only other complaint would be that most of the techniques shown are from a dominant position.  I think it would be helpful if more emphasis was placed on escapes and reversals.

Even with the shortcomings mentioned above, I still highly recommend this series to anyone interested in improving self-defense skills on the ground.  The techniques on these CD's were not intended for sport but many can be modified to complement a grappling sport style.",1297036800,2,886,4.86
8294691,5,B001DSDQUO,"This is the only instructional video package I've ever seen that doesn't teach simple techniques and magic escape tricks. These videos are about fighting. You learn the concept of a frame which allows you to instantly know what options you have. You'll see how to adapt the holds to changing conditions, improvising in real time. I've used this stuff already, laying on a Figure Four Wristlock in a seemingly impossible situation. I saw the frame and took the guy out. It wasn't pretty, but I actually felt the guy's joint separate. I've wasted lots of money on other videos. Lots of money. If you want to learn how to fight with grappling and wrestling, then this is the video. Lots of people can wrestle, but nobody can explain it and coach it like Mr. Cecchine.",1226448000,5,764,4.666666666666667
