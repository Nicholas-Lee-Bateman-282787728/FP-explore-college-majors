8142919,5,B000I0RPEQ,"I wish I could have picked this video up at Home Depot when I decide to remodel the kitchen and bathroom, I would have saved a TON of time and money.  Good information in a format that is easy to follow... who knew that you need to perform a load calculation prior to replacing fixtures.  Also reinforced is the absolute need to follow the manufacture instructions, I typically toss the instructions aside, now I know that I am putting my family at risk when I do that.  Great video, please make more.",1174953600,,501,4.423913043478261
