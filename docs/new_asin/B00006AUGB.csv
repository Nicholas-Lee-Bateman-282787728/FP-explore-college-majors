1739570,1,B00006AUGB,"Movie: 2  Stars, DVD Quality:  Star
I already had another DVD version of this Randolph Scott oater from Alpha Video Classics. However, I was hoping this version which proudly implies it to be a restored release would be an improvement. Unfortunately, both of these DVDs are not sourced from good sources. Both display an extremely poor picture full of scratches, visible snow and poor audio. The movie was filmed using Technicolors three-strip film process and has the ability to go toe to toe with todays modern formats. But, until this public domain movie is granted access to a quality distributor and uses its original source materials, we may never get to this this movie as it was meant to be seen. I would not recommend either distributors releases of this western.",1458086400,,772,4.885496183206107

1739631,4,B00006AUGB,"Rage at Dawn, 1955 film

This color movie is the ""true story"" of the Reno Brothers. Clint was a respected farmer. Frank, Simeon, John, and Bill were the first train robbers in American history. Their looting, burning and killing set the pattern for the great outlaw bands that followed (James, Youngers, and Daltons). The story begins in 1866 southern Indiana. A farm wagon drawn by four horses contains the Reno brothers. A man on a hill sends a signal, the townsmen expect the robbers. ""The Renos are coming!"" Will they suspect something? ""Its too quiet."" Frank decides to act. ""It's a trap!"" The townsmen ride after the gang. The Reno gang finds a refuge in Jackson county. [Note the table manners of the brothers, and their well-furnished dining table!] Laura offers advice. ""How did they know?"" Clint offers advice too.

The townspeople complain about their elected officials, but can do little in Seymour Indiana. The brothers wonder who was the informer. They tell a story to the bartender, he is new in town. Is Murphy a Pinkerton man? The Reno's take revenge. In Chicago the Pinkerton Agency has a new man to take on the Reno gang. There is a reported train robbery in the newspapers. Jim Barlow shops at a store, and flashes big bills. He meets Laura Reno, then two men. That $100 bill was part of the loot. The law goes to see Barlow and take him in. Barlow says he found the money, and wants to see the Judge. Barlow confides in the Judge, he is a practical man. They take the bait. Will they put Barlow on the Davies county job?

Barlow rides with the Reno gang across the state line to Missouri. They enter the courthouse for the Treasurer's Office, then leave with the loot. They will split up to avoid notice. Barlow sends a message to the Pinkerton's in Chicago. A traveling pedlar brings a message for a meeting. Barlow will bait a trap for the guilty. The train arrives. The Sheriff and his men are ready. Barlow stops the train. When the money box is dropped the lawmen act. Shots are fired, men are hit, some are captured. The people of Seymour demonstrate against country officials. Then people decide to eliminate the Reno gang.

Who is shooting at Barlow? Laura is sorrowful. Barlow is told of the townsmen actions. They attack the jail, imprison the sheriff, grab the Reno brothers, and pass judgment. Barlow can do nothing. The leaders are recognized, but they won't talk. ""I'm sorry Laura, I tried."" Will there be a happy ending for Laura and Jim?

This movie was filmed in Columbia Historic State Park. Does it look like southern Indiana? Randolph Scott looks a little too old in this movie. The pistols used were not around in the 1860s, they used cap-and-ball, not modern cartridges. This story was written by Frank Gruber, who wrote many novels and stories for television and the movies.",1396310400,,2818,4.673387096774194
1739632,5,B00006AUGB,This is a true to life story that follows History before the James Boys became a house hold name. It is about robbery greed and corruption. This an old movie but the story is well told. All the stunts are done by actors and Stuntmen this was in the days before computers made people look like they could do anything. I still think that computer enhanced movies suck because it is impossible for a human to do some of the things that the computer programmer comes up with.,1388102400,,471,4.363636363636363

1739638,4,B00006AUGB,"The Reno Brothers - Frank (Forrest Tucker), Sim (J. Carroll Naish), John (Myron Healey), and Bill (Richard Garland) - head up a band of notorious outlaws terrorizing southern Indiana just after the war. At a bank holdup in the town of North Vernon at the beginning of the film, youngest brother Bill is killed when the alert citizens and constabulary trap the group. The brothers flee across the county line, and try to figure out who set them up; they run the territory largely unopposed, and even their sister Laura (Mala Powers) and oldest brother Clint (Denver Pyle) who disapprove of them, tend to let them do their nasty business. They've got the local judge (the awesome Edgar Buchanan) and district attorney (Howard Petrie) in their pockets, so it's not long before they figure out that it's an undercover Peterson Detective Agency man, who they quickly eliminate. That brings Peterson's top man, James Barlow (Randolph Scott) onto the scene, hoping to more successfully infiltrate the group as a train robber who can bring them even greater riches - and naturally falling in love with beautiful Laura, who detests him once she finds out that he's (apparently) as bad as they are. How will it all work out in the end?

The storyline isn't anything particularly exciting, and it's fairly predictable up until the rather brutal ending; it's also more than a little distracting to see mountains and bluffs and scrubby landscapes in a film set in Indiana - why the locale wasn't changed to make it more believable given the California locations the film was shot in, I don't know. But the film does boast one of the best casts of any of Scott's 50s films, with Buchanan, Petrie, Tucker and Naish all standing out, and there are some interesting elements dealing with vigilantism near the end that, unfortunately, don't get explored as deeply as they could have been.  Well, what can you expect in an 87-minute RKO cheapie? At any rate, it's a solid film, directed competently enough by the rather obscure Tim Whelan - best known as one of the many directors on the 1940 fantasy masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thief-of-Bagdad/dp/B00152VXUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thief of Bagdad</a>, and helmer of one previous western (with Scott), 1946's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Badman-s-Territory/dp/B002E7I91E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Badman's Territory</a>.

Not overall one of Scott's best films, but like just about all of his 50s work, well worth seeing.  The Roan Group DVD is apparently the only edition offering the film in it's proper 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio, so it's worth getting for the Scott fanatic, though it's far from a perfect transfer.  You can also get this on numerous compilation discs with other Scott westerns, but they're all panned/scanned and the color is generally no better, and sometimes worse.  It seems highly unlikely that we'll see a beautiful restored transfer ever, so these are the choices for the forseeable future.",1292630400,,3070,5.39874739039666
1739658,4,B00006AUGB,"Randolph Scott made a lot of cowboy movies, and this is one of the good ones. Most of this is fairly believeable for the time it was made. I would recomend this to old movie buffs.",1259539200,,180,4.027777777777778

1739660,4,B00006AUGB,"This is what appears to be. The master negative is lost, and is probably the main reason this went public domain. All the prints I have seen except the Roan are from the same print source. Soft focus, poor color, and full screen. It is probably not pan and scan but the print minus the masking used to make it 1:85. At least Roan put it to 1:85 and found a sharper and somewhat better color print, but with more sprocket wear. I compared both sources at about 20 places. The Roan version wins! This is the one to get. I doubt you will find any better.  The source prints are the culprits, not the DVD Company. If you are a Randolph Scott fan (as I am) it is a good enough western. If not, this public domain print might not be your cup of tea.",1246492800,,743,4.089041095890411
1739661,5,B00006AUGB,This collection is well worth the money.  Randolph Scott at his best.  Very well directed and acted.  Well above the average western and very entertaining.,1218844800,,155,5.12
1739662,5,B00006AUGB,"I had a special, selfish reason for enjoying this vintage western: The action all takes place within 25-50 miles of my hometown of Madison, IN. When I began watching the movie I thought it was just another western -- until I heard the town names ""North Vernon"" and ""Seymour"" mentioned. What a shock!

This was one of Randolph Scott's last few movies -- he was 57 by this time, rather long in the tooth to be playing Mala Powers' love interest. But he managed. After all, when you're tall, have kept yourself in pretty good shape, and still have all your hair, with a distinguished gray cast, you can get away with that.

The film moves along briskly -- slightly under 90 minutes in length -- and is based pretty closely on the true story of the Reno brothers, Hoosiers who pulled what is considered the first peacetime train robbery in world history on Oct. 6, 1866, near their hometown of Seymour. The train caper was just one of many done by the four brothers and their gang. They really did rob several county treasurer's offices -- some as far away as Iowa -- as depicted in the movie. And several of them really did meet the grisly end shown here, at the hands of an organized band of vigilantes who decided that Seymour and Jackson County in southern Indiana had seen enough of the Reno boys and that the law would do nothing about their career of crime.

A special added fillip to this movie is that one of the stars, Forrest Tucker, was a native Hoosier in real life.

The Reno brothers weren't Hoosiers to be proud of, and their ""first"" wasn't one to be bragged about by their descendants. But I'm just state-proud enough to say I'm glad they made this movie, and glad that it was so faithful to the true story of the Renos.",1191801600,,1733,4.423197492163009
1739663,2,B00006AUGB,"This review is for the Roan DVD.  The movie is an okay western, nothing special, but it has some good moments, particularly those involving the corrupt officials of the town.  The transfer, unfortunately, is bad.  The color is uneven, the contrast is a mess, and the sharpness and clarity leave a lot to be desired.  So I do NOT recommend the Roan version of this film.",1187568000,,369,4.545454545454546

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

On return to their gangster friendly hometown of Seymour, Southern Indiana where they are in cahoots with the local sheriff (Ray Teal) the Judge (Edgar Buchanan) and Prosecuting Attorney (Howard Petrie). The brothers set a trap to find out who betrayed them Sim Reno (J. Carrol Naish) pretends to be drunk in the local saloon letting out false information to the bartender Murphy (Arthur Space) They discover that he is a Peterson agent, they captured tied him up in a stable, Frank Reno (Forrest Tucker) then proceeds to set the barn alight the Peterson man with it!

At the head office of The Peterson National Detective Agency in Chicago agent Monk Claxton (Kenneth Tobey) and told of the death of the Peterson man at Seymour he is then told he is to work with a new man special agent Jim Barlow (Randolph Scott) Petersons arrange for Barlow to rob a train so as to allow to infiltrate the Reno gang while Claxton stays on the outside as the contact man. On arrival in Seymour, Barlow makes a play for Laura Reno (Mala Powers) Later he also meets Clint Reno (Denver Pyle) who is a law-abiding citizen. Later, with difficulty he works his way in with the rest of the Reno brothers. A bank hold-up is carried out to establish Barlow's credentials followed by a set up train robbery - A violent shoot-out at the robbery followed by Barlow, Laura and Clint trying to thwart a lynch mob in North Vernon as we head towards ""rage at dawn"" (which refers to the films conclusion).

This RKO 87 minute western was director Tim Wheelan's penultimate film taken from a fact-based Frank Gruber story with screenplay by Horace McCoy. It has an excellent supporting cast which is necessary as Scott doesn't even appear until the film is some twenty minutes or so old. Now in the public domain (out of copyright) RAGE AT DAWN has been around for a few years on DVD and it can be found just about anywhere in various guises (packaging) and in Box Western Sets. I now see that a widescreen format is also available. I can only comment on my copy, which shows the same picture on the DVD case as the one on the Amazon site, sadly the transfer is poor which may just be due to the source movie, whatever it spoils a pretty good Scott western. Hence only three stars!",1169424000,,2446,4.531674208144796

1739668,4,B00006AUGB,"Rage at Dawn is a good 1955 Western starring Randolph Scott as an undercover government agent who infiltrates the notorious Reno brothers gang.  Scott (who was usually pretty good, but rarely great) gives one of his better performances in Rage, as all of his charm and personality comes shining through.  Like many stars of that era who (to some degree) played variations on the same character for much of their careers (John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, to name a few) Randolph Scott found his niche in Westerns and it fit him like a glove.

While Rage at Dawn isn't an award winning movie, it is very entertaining, and a good example of 1950's moviemaking.  The supporting cast is solid, and features a spirited performance from the late Denver Pyle.  If Westerns are your cup of tea you could do a lot worse than to pick up Rage at Dawn.

Roan's DVD is actually pretty good.  Sure, there is the common film reel ""wobble"" at the beginning, and there is plenty of dust and debris on this print, but the colors are still pretty good, and it is shown in anamorphic widescreen (unlike all the other versions of this movie on DVD).  The picture is a little soft, but still not too bad considering its age.  The sound is a bit muffled, but still listenable (I've heard a lot worse).  While this may not be a shining example of an anamorphic widescreen DVD it is more than passable for a public domain movie from the 1950's.  This would seem to be the best version of Rage at Dawn currently available.

-2017 Update:  This ROAN release is still, sadly, the best version of Rage at Dawn available.  On an HDTV the picture looks just a little softer than on an old tube TV, but it is still very watchable.  The DVD is in anamorphic widescreen, so that is a big plus.  The color is fairly solid for a public domain film of that era, but the blues do have an ever so slight greenish hue to them, and there are moments where the reds skew a little orange, but , overall, the color is better than average for this kind of release.  The more time passes the less likely it is that we'll see a better version get released on DVD or Blu Ray.  (That would sure be nice, though - this movie is as good as if not better than a lot of classics that have been released by Olive or Kino, and that kind of treatment would be welcomed for sure!)  For now, don't hesitate to buy the ROAN DVD of Rage at Dawn, it is a solid, entertaining Western from the mid 50's and this DVD is just good enough to not be detrimental to the enjoyment of the movie.",1119225600,,2533,4.328389830508475
1739669,3,B00006AUGB,"This is a great old ""B"" western, starring Randolph Scott, and some great character actors in Edgar Buchanan and Denver Pyle.
As for Roan Group's transfer of this movie...I'm sure it is better than those cheapy pan and scan transfers offered by other companies of public domain movies.
However....
While I've been pretty impressed with Roan up to now, I'd have to say that this...the first anamorphic widescreen movie I've purchased from them...needs a lot of work.
From the outset, the picture is jittery, making the opening credits quite challenging. Add to that, quite a bit of source damage, a general picture softness, and, toward the end, a good amount of grain, and you have what would be considered a ""bad"" transfer by a major studio.
Odd thing about the DVD is....the theatrical trailer has a superb picture...quite the opposite of most releases. This shows that most of the problem with this DVD was probably the source movie. I'd recommend Roan take another shot at this one...or at least learn a lesson on their future anamorphic releases.",1082160000,,1050,4.937853107344632

7/5/12 UPDATE _ PLEASE NOTE:
Amamzon has listed two different editions, and reviews for both are mixed together.
There is a 1 disc set:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-American-Western-V-1-The/dp/B00009MEHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great American Western V.1, The</a>&nbsp;- it runs 309 minutes total/has 4 films(see below in my review)

which runs 680 minutes(must be at least 8 films) - but other than the same 4 listsed on the 1 disc edition, the titles are not shown.

You may want to check with outside sellers to see what other films are in the edition they are selling and also to make sure you are getting the edition you want, if purchasing from the outside merchants.

I have sent Amazon a note asking them to correct this. Hopefully they will.

Review of 1 disc edition:
Randolph Scott is the feller that sets the ladies hearts a flutter, and saves the day not once, but four times in these old 'oaters' that will cure that hankerin' for the sights and sounds of the old west so many of us love. Four fun films, with great stars, notable filmmakers and writers, and definitive Western fare from the 1930's, 40's and 50's at a price you can't refuse! Such a deal!

The films: ""To The Last Man"", from 1933 based on a Zane Grey story, is truly the story of who will be the last man standing, as two families' fussin' and feudin' takes it's toll on all over the years. And to boot, the Romeo and Juliette theme takes over as our guy Randy falls for the wrong woman! It's directed by Henry Hathaway, and what a cast..Esther Ralston, Jack La Rue, Buster Crabbe, Noah Berry, Gail Patrick and Fuzzy Knight. Also look for John Carradine and a little tiny Shirley Temple.
""The Fighting Westerner""...This one made in 1935 is another adapation of a Zane Grey novel(""Rocky Mountain Mystery""). Scott stars as a detective sleuthing a sudden outbreak of mysterious murders at a mining co. Suspect no one, suspect everyone! Lots of twists and turns, and a little romance as well. It is directed by Charles Barton and costars Ann Sheridan, Kathleen Burke, Willie Fung and Charles ""Chic"" Sale who adds quite a bit of humor to the story.
""Abilene Town""(1946)...A three way mini civil war breaks out in the town of Abilene, Kansas. Cattle drovers,the town merchants, and the new homesteaders go at it. Can't we all just get along???...It's up to our guy to come up with a plan for all to leave in peace. Fabulous faces to look for..Lloyd Bridges, Rhonda Fleming, Edgar Buchanan, Ann Dvorak and Helen Boyce. It is directed by Edwin L. Marin.
""Rage At Dawn"": From 1955, this one is in technicolor and is based on the Reno Brothers. Robbing banks, terrorizing the good townspeople, and just being a general menace to society, these guys needed to be stopped! Enter one brave lawman James Barlow(Scott), who infiltrates the outfit and tries to restore law and order to the community. It's not easy though, as the town leaders are getting kick backs from the bad guys are are not willing partcipants to seeing justice done! More wonderful stars include Forrest Tucker and another appearance by Edgar Buchanan. Directed by Tim Whelan.

Okay, so these films are not pristeen. They do show their age. There are scatches from the prints, and there is occasional humming noise in the background. But for the most part the pictures themselves were surprisingly clear and all have had the sound enhanced in DD5.1. The color seemed a little off in ""Rage At Dawn""....But hey..for the price, I thought Platinum, did a great job of putting together so many of these packages for us Western lovers to choose from. There isn't anything on these transfers that take away from the enjoyment of the view. The films are all on one disc and all on one side. There are 4 chapter stops per film. The films run from about an hour to an hour and a half.

When I ordered this DVD, other then that they all starred Randolph Scott, I didn't know what I would be getting. As of yet, Amazon, does not list the titles, so it's kind of a grab bag. But as I was getting ready to order volume 2(the Lee Van Cleef series), and going through the list available, I did notice that there are also package deals with anywhere from 5 to 10 discs at an even lower price then buying them seperately. You can also just look for your favorite star(John Wayne,Gary Cooper, etc).It's a tough decision to wrastle with.

So if you git a hankerin for watchin the good guys vs. them lily livered pole cats,check out these ""Great American Westerns"".

Five stars to Platinum for bringing us all these package deals and making it easy and inexpensive for us Western fans to get our daily dose of 'oaters'.

Happy trails.....Laurie",1079395200,,5149,5.047058823529412
1739671,4,B00006AUGB,"Another offering from the Roan Group.
""Rage at Dawn"" is an interesting, but not particularly classic western. What makes it stand apart from most is the introduction of espionage.
Sturdy as ever, Scott is a ""Peterson"" man, an obvious allusion to the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency. He must infiltrate a gang of murderous outlaw brothers, and trick them into causing their own downfall. Their beautiful sister, a non-crook, and Scott naturally hit it off.
Familiar faces? How about a clean-shaven Denver Pyle? Pyle, best known to TV viewers of the 1970's as the white-bearded Mad Jack on ""Grizzly Adams"", or Uncle Jessie Duke on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", Pyle was a supporting player in many westerns. Here, he plays the good brother who won't join in with his brothers' crookery.
Then there's Edgar Buchanan, famous as old Uncle Joe from ""Petticoat Junction"". In this film, he plays a crooked judge, on the bad brothers' payroll.
Of course, Forrest Tucker is the head bad guy, and J. Carrol Naish is along as another bad brother.
A good, sturdy western, with Scott playing his usual smiling tough guy (kind of a non-emoting Gary Cooper). Always fun to see Scott playing it cool in the face of the bad guys.",989712000,,1207,4.835748792270532

7966580,3,B00006AUGB,"Released in 1955 and directed by Tim Whelan, Rage at Dawn stars Randolph Scott as a special agent sent to Indiana to infiltrate the notorious Reno Gang, who carried out the first three peacetime train robberies in the USA. The stolen money was largely never recovered. Forrest Tucker plays the top member of the gang, Frank, while Mala Powers plays the honest sister of the brothers, Laura, whom Scotts character decides to romance.

Theres only one other movie based on the exploits of the Reno Gang, which was Elvis debut film Love Me Tender, released the year after Rage at Dawn. Rage is more faithful to the true story, although the special agent played by Scott is fictitious and Laura, while not part of the gang, wasn't squeaky clean as depicted, plus she was loyal to her brothers. But the movies accurate in that Clint Reno (Denver Pyle) refused to be part of the gang and was called Honest Clint, not to mention the notorious ending is faithful to history, albeit no one was apprehended for the crime (Im being ambiguous because I don't want to give it away).

Scott is at his charismatic best here as he romances a girl thats clearly younger than half his age. Randolph was 56 during filming whereas cutie Mala was 23 (!), but this is okay once you understand that Scotts character is supposed to be around 35 (even though he looks like hes at least 50). Forrest Tucker is also great as the malevolent Frank Reno.

Unfortunately, the obvious California locations ruin the movie because the storys set in the Ohio River region of Indiana, Missouri and surrounding areas, which look nothing like California. Moreover, the last act isn't very engaging despite the action; it somehow loses the interest attained in the first two acts. Still, Rage at Dawn is one of only two movies based on the Reno Gang and its the more accurate of the two; not to mention the principle actors are great.

The movie runs 87 minutes and was shot in Columbia, Sonora & Chico, California.
