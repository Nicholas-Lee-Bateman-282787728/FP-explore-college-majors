4070542,5,B0035JHYG6,I enjoyed this DVD very much.  The story kept my interest.  I was very happy with the product and the deliver.,1375142400,,110,4.190476190476191
4070543,5,B0035JHYG6,I first saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel a couple of years or so ago.  I just loved it and wanted it in my library,1360886400,,120,3.6153846153846154
4070544,5,B0035JHYG6,Ladies Of The House is very entertaining.  3 ladies remodel a house as a church project.  Donna Mills was especially good in her scenes.  A well done film that makes some good points about how much you can do if you try.,1358726400,,220,4.190476190476191
4070545,4,B0035JHYG6,I did enjoy this movie. The ladies house project was fun and how they learned and grew from being involved in renovating the house for their church.  One thing that isn't mentioned is that there is a sad part of the movie where a character dies from cancer. You should know that before you watch with someone who may be affected by that. The main lady characters are done very well and it is really fun seeing them renovate a house on their own (mostly). What I did find odd is that 2 of the husbands didn't want to be involved and both were retired and one seemed lost and without purpose. I'm glad the ladies did the work but since the one guy was grumpy about nothing to do he could have helped! All the characters lives (ladies) do change from start of movie to end.  It is a fun movie to watch (mostly) and  you root for the ladies and their challenges during their project.,1296086400,8,879,4.251497005988024
4070546,5,B0035JHYG6,"The Hallmark movie ""Ladies of the House"" is a great movie.  I really enjoyed watching the three actresses Florence Henderson, Pam Greer and Donna Mills work very hard to renovate an old run down house which will be sold to benefit their church's day care center.

I noticed that Amazon has the wrong actors mentioned on the title page for the movie, Jennifer Anadreacola and Joshua Anadreacola as the main stars.",1279670400,10,412,4.788732394366197
