7435933,3,B015GKSXA2,"I remember this having a better transfer in the unofficial releases. Funi really knows how not to make a great transfer. It's only a slight upgrade from the DVDs. In fact you may get the same result from using a Blu-ray or an upconverter to see the DVDs in 1080p. Sure it looks sharper, but only by a little bit. What you mainly want is the new audio, which also sounds great. Other than that maybe keep those DVDs. Those provide much more information on the Death Note books too. You don't get much besides a manga of the first chapter.",1502064000,,537,4.326732673267327

7435945,5,B015GKSXA2,One of the best anime series ever.,1484956800,,34,4.0
7435946,2,B015GKSXA2,I have been a long time fan of death note the manga anime and the two live action movies so when I heard about a drama I had to have it but sadly it falls short. The new spin of an average kid finding a death note is interesting on paper and even helps to sympathize with this version of light but when he begins to out wit a genius L I have to roll my eyes but I would even be able to ignore that if not for the horrible subtitles that at times make absolutely no since. For example when the police find a young man dead one of the officers says fresh rolls or something to that affect its laughable at times and at others you will be completely lost if you don't know the story. So a fair warning it's an interesting ride but I would not buy this again.,1483488000,,755,3.909090909090909
7435947,5,B015GKSXA2,It was a gift. Recipient liked it very much.,1482192000,,44,4.0
7435948,5,B015GKSXA2,"1st of all, 90% of the reason for this purchase, was because all prior reviews of this exact DeathNote OMEGA, stated it has 2 live action movies included, However, this is completely incorrect, this does NOT inclued ANY live action, every disc is Anime.
2nd excellent quality, excellent  English conversion with the qreat Japanese feelings and psychotic emotions..
VERY WELL DONE...
3rd their are 3 versions of Death Note in this box set,
Version One is the full movie mode with all 37 seasons editied and combined.
Verion Two is the complete Television series in full, all 37 seasons

7435952,2,B015GKSXA2,"I'm very unhappy with this CD. I love the Live-Action Drama itself, but the English subbing is horrible! I watch this drama on a different website the the subbing makes way more sense then this one. I have watched this drama before so I understand what is going on, but for someone who doesn't even know basic words in Japanese, example being ""Die!"" is Korosu (ko-ro-su-) is how it sounds in Japanese, but one time it said ""Craved"" that just makes no sense! I would really like to see the subbing fixed, but I know that won't happen. This CD fell short of my expectations and I'm unsatisfied with it.",1470009600,2,600,4.463636363636364

7435958,5,B015GKSXA2,"I love this! It's so much better quality than what I've watched before. I have watched Death Note around 10 times in the absolute poorest qualities (being the best I could find online.) I randomly searched Amazon to see if there was a Blu-Ray out for it about a week ago, to find this beauty. I live in the UK but I had to have it and ordered it immediately. It only took 4 days to arrive (fastest I've ever received something from the US too.)

The Pilot manga was a good read, I wouldn't have minded seeing more to do with those characters.
The outer casing has awesome artwork and so do the discs themselves. I cannot wait to watch it again properly, in the quality that it is meant to be watched in. I'm so stoked about this purchase.",1464393600,2,738,4.23404255319149

7435965,4,B015GKSXA2,"NOTE:  This is a review for the ""Omega"" Edition.  There are two different versions of the recent Bluray ""complete"" releases by Viz (""The Omega Edition"" and ""The Complete Series Standard Edition"")

The descriptions written for both versions, in the product information, on Amazon are somewhat lacking and inaccurate - so to get out of the way, here is what the Omega Edition contains:

- Metallic Chipboard Box
- All 1-37 Episodes
- 2 OVA Feature Length Films ""Director's Cut Complete Conclusion Relight: Visions of a God"" & ""Relight 2: L's Successors"" (Audio Japanese, English, and French only with Eng & French subs only)
- An ""Artbook"" (as listed on other sites), slightly inaccurate - The ""artbook"" is actually a Manga, it is the Pilot that 'began' the Manga series first appearing in ""Weekly Shonen Jump #36"" (Original Japanese Edition, translated to English in traditional Manga style, left to right)
- Lifted extras from DVD versions including interviews with the creators, behind-the-scenes footage of the English and Japanese voice cast, production art and much more
- PLUS NEW extras for the bluray release
- Spoken Language: English, Japanese, Spanish, French, Portugese (Audio 2.0) (Episodes 1-37)
- Subtitle Language: English, Spanish, French, Portugese (Episodes 1-37) (Episodes 1-37)

The ""Complete Series Standard Edition"" DOES NOT contain the Pilot Manga and OVA Films.

For those unsure what the OVA films are:  Re-Light 1 & 2 are actually the episodes edited into a film format, with some new scenes and small changes here and there not seen in the episodes.  Re-Light 1 is the first-half of the anime, while 2 is the other half.

***Review***

PACKAGING  - Good; all the episodes 1-37 + the 2 OVA's are contained in 1 Blu-ray Disc package holding 6 Discs in total.  The Chipboard Box is sturdy and easily holds the Manga + Blu-ray Disc Case.  It's certainly not as ""cool"" as the DVD Complete 're-package' from 2014 that looked and felt more like an actual 'Death Note' book.

VISUALS - Very good; some reviewers or commenters are stating the visuals don't seem to appear to be any different between these new releases and the past DVD versions.  I can report that the visuals definitely ARE improved, as much of the animation looks 'sharper' and cleaned up, but may not be noticed right away unless you view both side by side with a keen eye.  The animated version of Death Note, however, always had a muted or soft/smudgy look to it.  To me the animation is actually improved to the point where it looks ""new,"" but only just so - there is only so much that can done in some cases with whatever they did to upscale the drawn animation.  In the end, it still looks better than the DVD and Streaming versions.  I took side by side screenshots including below the review to show the difference (Std Def Left vs Upscaled Bluray Right).

AUDIO - Good; the audio is standard fair here, and still is pretty much the same.

SUBTITLES - Good, but there are ""issues"" ; To put it bluntly, they seemed to have overlooked adding English subtitles anywhere on screen where they display the ""area"" or a ""sign"" when English subtitles are turned OFF.  For example, in the second screenshot below, during the opener of Episode 1, the stylized Japanese Kanji display which is translated as the ""Shinigami Realm"" in English above, which only displays if you have English subtitles ON.  However, this is only helpful if you are actually watching it with Japanese Audio with English subtitles (which I do, and don't mind, but this is definitely an issue for others that others have noted as well).  If you watch it with English Audio and Subtitles ON, the subtitles for spoken words do not match what is written on the screen but at least you know what the Japanese text is supposed to say.  This is more or less the main reason why I have knocked 1 star from this review.

***

STORY - Amazing; many collectors and Anime fans are already aware of what Death Note is when they fell in love with it way back when it first appeared as a Manga, an Anime, and live-action as well.  For those that have no clue what Death Note is, I recommend the Anime as a MUST WATCH (or if you're into reading, a MUST READ); the story itself is PURE intense thriller that keeps you guessing, with great characters, awesome scenes, and excellent music.  Its also NOT for the squeamish.

***

Overall, for the price and contents, the Omega edition is definitely worth it if you want the extra stuff as an Anime collector.",1458086400,190,4497,4.726923076923077
7435966,5,B015GKSXA2,"J'attendais depuis des annes une rdition Blu-ray de Death Note et je ne suis pas du. L'image est claire et prend bien tout l'cran (32"" dans mon cas) ; ct audio je n'ai pas  me plaindre, le son est pur et il avec cinq langues disponibles aussi bien en audio qu'en sous-titres il y en a pour tous les gots (personnellement je regarde en japonais sous-titr franais). Le manga accompagnant les disques est galement trs intressant.
Pour le prix auquel je l'ai eu ($49,99) cela vaut vraiment le coups, je ne peux que recommander ce produit. Attention cependant, ce Blu-ray est rgion A, assurez-vous d'avoir l'quipement ncessaire.",1458000000,,623,4.822429906542056
7435967,2,B015GKSXA2,"Video quality is actually poorly done. The video is also overly cropped and they cut picture from the sides then stretched the image causing things to look off or fatter. It looks like they used a crap ton of noise reduction or sharpening because it looks like a smudged watercolor painting instead of a nice image.

If you are obsessed with video quality and top notch masters, you will be disappointed thats for sure. If your just an average viewer, don't care too much about the details of things, or don't know a ton about video editing and mastering, then this should suffice just fine for you I would think since you may not notice or know what it could be if done correctly.

Upscaled DVD and Blu-Ray screenshot comparisons can be viewed here. Just choose the image at the top then hover over it to switch between DVD and Blu-Ray screenshots.

7435970,5,B015GKSXA2,"I've been waiting for this for a long time! I've owned the DVD box sets for years, and I'm glad that I can finally get this amazing show in Blu-ray! So far I've watched the first 7 episodes and you can definitely see a difference. The images are sharper and the picture quality is still amazing for an anime that was released 10 years ago. I'm also glad that this comes with the two Re-light OVAs (that funeral scene tho..). I'll take a potato chip.... and EAT IT!!

10/10 Must Buy!!",1456963200,5,483,4.3076923076923075
7435971,5,B015GKSXA2,"I am so thrilled about this. I am writing about the Death Note Omega Edition in bluray format, and so far it has exceeded my expectations. I have owned a couple of copies of Death Note on DVD, and in all honesty it didn't look much better than anything I've seen, or streamed, online. Some of the higher quality streams looked better than the DVDs I owned, actually.

This bluray product has finally shed some light (aha) on a lot of scenes that were too dark and too pixelated on their standard definition - so after what feels like 10 years I can finally see and understand what certain scenes were trying to show. I have not watched all the episodes yet, nor have I watched the two film features, but so far the subtitles are on point, the exposure and vibrancy are better than I thought would be possible, and the quality is extremely nice; I hardly notice any blurry moments or pixel static as is usually seen on upscales.

I will update this further once I have watched the whole set, but for now I can say I definitely recommend this to any Death Note fan as it is well worth the price. You know how incredible this anime is, do yourself a favor and buy it in high def.",1456876800,27,1176,4.292792792792793

8733497,5,B015GKSXA2,"I'd like to take a moment to talk about the Netflix movie with Willem Dafoe.

That movie is an excellent case study in how substituting one character with a superficially similar one can completely derail a story. Pretty much all of the best scenes in the Death Note anime are a result, in one way or another, from Misa being the second Kira. When you remove Misa as the second Kira, you remove the plot point in which she is detained and tortured by L in hopes of getting a confession. When you knock that piece out of the Jenga tower, two things happen: one, you lose the plot thread in which Light confesses to being the first Kira, which means you lose the ""I'm going to kill you and then kill myself"" scene, which was one of the best scenes in the whole anime. Second, you lose the plot point in which Rem gives Misa's notebook to that guy from the Yotsuba corporation in order to free Misa, and then the entire Yotsuba story arc evaporates. And then your entire Jenga tower is spilled all over the floor.

So yeah. the anime is way better than the Netflix movie.",1517270400,,1068,4.335

Although I watched this with Japanese dub and English sub., I wish there were Thai subtitles since interestingly enough, the opening music has Thai text running through, but this set only has English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Death Note is a classic animation that could be rewatched many times due to its complexity plot wise.
