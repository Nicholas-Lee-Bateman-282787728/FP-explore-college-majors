8442579,4,B004V2FUHQ,"The story of the movie is a very old one. The story revolves around Rakesh Roshan and Rekha. Rekha has proved herself as a best actress once again after her gorgeous thriller""Khoon Bhari Maang"".It is very unfortunate in this movie is that others get no score for their acting .Rakesh Bedi tries to make film viewers laugh but he fails .The songs are very entertaining. The climax is made in a stupid way and a lengthy one. The comedy adds a plus to the movie but not to a large extent. There is nothing special in this movie except some songs. Rekha succeeds in her Compettion as a best actress compared to new actresses in the 80's. Watch the movie for just relaxing yourself. I give 6/10 for this movie.",1304985600,,705,4.430769230769231
