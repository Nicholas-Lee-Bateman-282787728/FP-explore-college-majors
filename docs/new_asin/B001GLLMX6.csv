8305812,4,B001GLLMX6,"I've watched all but one of the Harlequin romances available on Amazon Prime video and this one was the best. They are all predictable and dated, but this one had the best plot, actors and locales. A decent time pass.",1511395200,,217,4.45
8305813,3,B001GLLMX6,"This movie is about what I expected from a Harlequin Romance movie in terms of dialog, acting abilities, etc.  However, the filming sites were beautiful, and included Vienna and Budapest. The mystery angle of the story was also fairly well done.  The movie was very dated by the clothes worn by the actors.  But it was enjoyable and easy to follow.",1511222400,,348,4.672131147540983

8305816,5,B001GLLMX6,"First, I want to comment about two other reviews.  One gave an ""One Star"" because the DVD that he purchased didn't work well.  That is not a review of the movie as the same review went on to say that the movie was copied from a TV airing and then transcribed onto a DVD for a great cost.  You don't do that expense for an ""One Star"" movie.  Then another states the movie was excellent but gave it a ""Two Star"" ranking.  I personally enjoyed the movie. Yes, it was made for TV some years ago, but the actors all did a great job, the story line interesting, and had a mystery. The filmography was beautiful with all the European countrysides and cities. The title and the cover does not match the story very well...nothing about a lullaby and a baby in the story.  There even was a ball with gowns.  I loved it and give 5 stars!",1504137600,,826,4.189873417721519
8305817,4,B001GLLMX6,An interesting movie.  There is a thread of Hungarian culture that runs thru this movie which resonates with my wife who is hungarian.  A good mystery movie!,1457481600,,157,4.777777777777778

8305820,4,B001GLLMX6,"After reading the other review, I felt this movie deserved a more positive out look.  I can not comment on the quality of the DVD through Amazon since I purchased mine for $5 in a bargain store, but I can comment on the movie itself.  I watched it last night, and found it totally charming.  The Mills and Boon books are not exactly life changing stories, so I didn't expect their movies to be either.  If you want something which is just enjoyable and easy to watch then this is it.  There was enough of a storyline to keep my interest, with romance and mystery thrown into the mix.  The hero and heroine were very likeable.  Especially the hero - I found he had just the right amount of good looks and charm to make him a worthy love interest.  The scenery is lovely with the story taking place in several countries throughout Europe.  There is even a good twist at the end - which I won't spoil.  The only complaint is that the background music gets very loud during the main love scene (seriously, I thought it would disturb my neighbours - lol).  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Mills and Boon franchise.",1347840000,,1137,4.341232227488152
8305821,1,B001GLLMX6,"Do not waste any money on this particular version of this film!  The plot is halfway decent and the romance scenes are somewhat good for a made-for-television movie. But, whoever transferred this film from a canister of tape to DVD ought to be shot! The quality of this movie on DVD is deplorable.  I personally made my own copy of this film by recording it off of my television on to a VHS tape.  Then using a $180 VCR/DVD player with transfer capability I transferred it on to a blank DVD disc and that copy that I made using a disc that cost roughly $1 to $1.50 is about 80% to 90% better than this DVD.",1298505600,,606,4.206896551724138
