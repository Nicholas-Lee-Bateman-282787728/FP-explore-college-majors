8129997,4,B000GAKQP8,"We got an incredible buy on this DVD box set on Amazon and are generally very happy with our purchase.  Clearly the `Galloping Gourmet' of old has worked hard to take control of the reins of health & fitness rather than just guiding us towards the finer points of gourmet taste and aesthetic presentation.  Mr. Kerr's series features interesting fact & science based guests along with the art of fine cooking at generally half the calories and fat of traditional recipes.  These elements are fantastic and encourage redirected thinking about food preparation.  However, the 9 segments and recipes only begin to scratch the itch for new ways of delivering healthier deliciousness to the family table (So, see their series of books on the topic and that of others in the movement).

For us the only downside of this DVD box set was the flamboyant production values and Mr. Kerr's almost manic delivery as he seeks to pump up his live audience in an almost Liberace-light setting. He is almost too passionate, kind of over the top, at least for our sensibilities.  Frankly his presentation is almost a little too needy of audience validation, which he generally gets in abundance.  Well, OK.  We got over our discomfort with the slickness and tapped into his authentic passion for reforming the art of cooking to make it delicious, beautiful and as healthy as possible.  So, if you can buy this box set at a reasonable price and are prepared to be open-minded, you will likely be very pleased with the influence of the Kerr couple's crusade to propagate delicious, healthy food to your circle of family and friends.  Their underlying philosophy is heartfelt if a bit difficult to access, in full, given the somewhat awkward menu structure of this DVD series.

If the presentation was a bit more subdued, we'd probably have given it 5 Stars, as it is we give it a solid 4 star rating.",1253923200,15,1880,4.771604938271605
