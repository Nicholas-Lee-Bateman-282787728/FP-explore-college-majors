8725843,4,B012BQ460K,"These two discs (there are really four, but two are Blu-Ray and two are DVD, with the same contents) contain 36 short films. Most are only five to fifteen minutes long, so they can make a nice break from work or other activities when you want to put your mind in a Completely Different Place for a short time. Most of the films do not attempt to tell a story, and many are completely abstract, just moving shapes set to music.

Im not a student of film history, so I cant comment on the historical importance of these films, but the collection certainly gave me a good look at the way techniques and viewpoints changed over time. One of the things I found most interesting was seeing how different filmmakers at different times treated the same subject, such as life in a big cityit always seems to be New Yorkwhich appears over and over. Manhatta (1920) and Skyscraper Symphony (1929), for instance, focused on the citys huge buildings, then new and exciting, with people as mere scurrying afterthoughts or (rather creepily) absent entirely. Later filmmakers concentrated more on the people, but with very different mindsets. The Pursuit of Happiness (1940), featuring endlessly hurrying legs, suggested that that pursuit was likely to be hopeless, whereas the poor but laughing children in In the Street gave a hint about where the happiness might have gone. Film techniques in many of the earlier films were relatively straightforward, but the 1950s N.Y., N.Y. drew on fly-eye multiple exposures, funhouse-mirror distortion, and other possibly new tools to create a playfully surreal vision.

As one is bound to do with any anthology, I found some examples that I loved, a few that I thought were a complete waste of time, and a lot that were simply curious or interesting. Other viewers choices for those categories no doubt would be different from mine, but I think almost anyone will discover among these little nuggets some new and fascinating ways of using the photography of motion to examine and play with the world.",1466812800,9,2026,4.869565217391305

8725845,4,B012BQ460K,"Masterworks of American Avant-garde Experimental Film from Flicker Alley is a solid collection of films, but falls in that strange DVD collection category. Here I am thinking of maybe the Wim Wenders box set which left out ""Alice in the Cities,"" and ""Kings of the Road."" Masterworks is well worth purchasing for ""In the Street,"" ""Ballet Mechanique,"" ""Lot in Sodom,"" and Brakhage and Solomon's ""Seasons."" There are some marvels here, but some of the films can be found in other collections, Library of Congress, etc. The fact that they are also on Blu-Ray is a plus. Back to the strange DVD phenomena, it's what they left out which is a little aggravating. This is definitely a good addition to some of the other Avant-garde film collections out there(KINO series comes to mind,) but wish there was more in this collection such as Sidney Peterson, Ken Jacobs, Bruce Connor, Carolee Schneeman, etc., etc. Masterworks is good, but could be even better.",1449273600,10,949,4.9375
8725846,5,B012BQ460K,"What a commendable achievment from Flicker Alley. This 7-hour compilation represents everything the curious viewer needs to know about the history of experimental film. I'm a mildly obsessive collector of all things avant-garde, from music to art to movies, so I already knew most of disc one's contents from the Unseen Cinema set, and the three Kino collections. I am happy to say that the new resorations for blu-ray here are a stunning improvement. It's disc two that really rocks it for me - one incredibly rare and bizarre treasure after another, most never before released on disc. Because these films were mostly unconcered with issues or fashions of their time, the haven't dated poorly at all. Watching 1924's ""Ballet Mechanique"" is just as strange an experience today as listening to the latest album by Nurse With Wound. I understand this kind of out-there material is not for everybody, but if you're interested, I can't recommend it enough.",1445040000,10,953,5.037974683544304
8725847,5,B012BQ460K,"No matter how you may feel about the films contained within this collection and they are definitely a mixed bag, MASTERWORKS OF AMERICAN AVANT-GARDE EXPERIMENTAL FILM 1920-1970 (the title says it all) is an invaluable collection not only for its vocabulary of film technique but also as a historical document of trends long past and objects no longer with us. The set is bookended by the earliest film in the collection MANHATTA, a photographic study of NYC from 1920-21. Other notables from the 1920s include the once notorious BALLET MECHANIQUE with music by George Antheil and Robert Florey's LIFE & DEATH OF 9413 - A HOLLYWOOD EXTRA. During the 1930s the experimentation continues with the 20 year old Jay Leyda's A BRONX MORNING, the once shocking short feature LOT IN SODOM, the visually striking POEM 8 by Emien Etting and 1938's OPTICAL POEM an abstract cartoon from Warner Brothers set to Liszt's HUNGARIAN RHAPSODY # 2 (2 years before Walt Disney came out with FANTASIA).

As we all know, World War II had a powerful impact on Hollywood and society in general. Well it affected avant-garde cinema as well. During and after the war the tone of the shorts becomes darker and more abstract. Titles in the 1940s segment such as 1941, MESHES OF THE AFTERNOON and MEDITATION ON VIOLENCE reflect this. By the 1950s it seemed as if anything and everything was possible. The selections ABSTRONICS, BELLS OF ATLANTIS (with Anais Nin), and GYROMORPHOSIS bear this out. The 1960s were the 1960s and there's some really wild stuff here including CASTRO STREET and the bizarrely titled FILM THAT RISES TO THE SURFACE OF CLARIFIED BUTTER. As a fan of 19th century illustrations & engravings, I especially enjoyed OUR LADY OF THE SPHERE. The 1970s segment leads off with LOVE IT / LEAVE IT which opens with a ""Naked City"" parade in Chicago that has to be seen to be believed. The abstract DL2 and Amy Greenfield's powerful TRANSPORT leave a strong impression. 36 films in all make up this collection. These shorts (as the title implies) are far removed from mainstream cinema but they are worth preserving and once again Film Preservation Associates & Flicker Alley have done an exceptional job.",1443744000,20,2189,4.884408602150538
