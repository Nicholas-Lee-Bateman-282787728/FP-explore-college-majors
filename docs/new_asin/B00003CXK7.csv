1265462,4,B00003CXK7,"From the trailers of this movie, you tend to think ""Loser"" is about a bumbling idiot, a homeless girl, and a couple of idiotic college  roommates. Well, the idiot roommates aside, I was completely amazed by this  movie. Jason Biggs' character was a sweet, slightly out of touch young man,  but not a complete loser as were other people in the movie. I thought the  movie was touching, and funny, and warm. Yes, this is the opinion of a 23  year old female, and not a sex-crazed teenager who probably makes fun of  real people not unlike ""Paul"". But hey, movies are for  entertainment. I think this may be the most underrated movie of the year. I  went back for more a few days later. Enough said.",966211200,4,696,4.425196850393701

1265465,1,B00003CXK7,"When my friends and I went to see this movie we were expecting a fast paced,laugh-a-minute teen comedy. Something in the tradition of  ""American Pie"". Instead we watched what might turn out to be the  worst movie of the year! This movie is just about as funny as ""Last  Tango In Paris"" is. Anyone expecting Jason Biggs to turn in another  extremely funny performances like he did in ""American Pie"" will  be disappointed. And in no way is Mena Suvari as sexy as she was in  ""American Beauty"". The best character here is Greg Kinnear's. But  does anyone really care? To say he had the best role in the movie isn't  really saying much! Amy Heckerling has always managed to make funny movies.  I'm not saying all of them were great movies,but there was always something  to laugh at,right now I'm thinking about ""Clueless"" and  ""Johnny Dangerously"". I have no idea what she was thinking when  she made this,but I'm sorry she did. Stay away from this movie,as your  leaving,you'll end up feeling like a real ""loser"" for seeing it.",965952000,,1025,4.627777777777778
1265466,2,B00003CXK7,"I don't know what possessed me to see this film.  Maybe after seeing Scary Movie, I was in hopes to find meaning and cheez back in teenager flicks.  I  was wrong. Amazon was right, Jason Biggs was great, Mena Suvari was  charming, and Greg Kinnear was smug.  They just didn't have much to work  with.  I didn't think Jason Biggs character was that much of a loser, he  was more of an innocent, naive, too-trusting Mid Western boy, who had  possibly the worse luck with freshman roommate placement.  The three guys  that he had to spend his college orientation days were such (as they would  say) faux-pas in their boas, flashy clothing, rayban sun glasses, and their  schemes to getting girls. The love story was cute.  Mena's character  impressed me.  She was a cool cat, that had to deal with a lot prematurely  but she seemed to get through it all right.
The story is simple but it  definitely didn't WOW me.  Of course, what should I expect from a teenager  flick.",965347200,10,968,4.517441860465116
1265467,4,B00003CXK7,"When i think of smart teen comedies i automatically think of Director Amy  Heckerling and movies such as fast Times At Ridgemont High and Clueless.  Heckerling has the ability to weave the same old characters the cliches and  the story into cinematic gold. With Loser she dosn't lose much of that  ability although i found it to be a little less funny than i thought.
Loser is about Paul played by Jason Biggs who goes to college in New  York City and he is worried that he won't fit in and he has right to worry  so his roommates say. While there he meets Dora played by Mena Suvari who  is a bar waitress who is the only person he is able to talk to who is also  having an affair with a pretentious Lit Professer played by Greg  Kinnear.
Yes in the hands of an unknown director this would have been a  lame old romance with few laughs. Jason Biggs is perfect for the role as a  Loser with his reactions he is able to be very convincing. Mena Suvari is  very charming Greg Kinnear is perfectly smug and the three roommates are  very funny really the entire cast is very funny. Although not as funny as  Clueless. But Loser is a winner in a big way.  This really puts to shame  Down to You and Whatever it takes.",964915200,,1212,4.2043478260869565
1265468,3,B00003CXK7,"This movie was a little deceptive.  Prior to viewing it I thought that it was going to be similar to American Pie based off of the commercials, it  wasn't.  That isn't to say that the film wasn't good or enjoyable though.  I think Jason Biggs was great, he played the roll of the loser very well.
The movie centers on Biggs and his transition to the ""big  city.""  He is quick to discover that he doesn't fit in and in the  words of one of his roommates, ""No one likes you.""  After his  roommates kick him out of their dorm, Biggs takes up residence in a  veterinarian's office.
From his newly liberated ""dorm"", Biggs  discovers that it takes more than being a ""nice guy"" to win the  girl.  When all hope appears to be lost, Biggs makes a phone call home and  details how hard life has been and how much he cares for Mena Suvari, who  happens to overhear his conversation.  She quickly realizes that she feels  the same way and a blossoming romance ends the movie.  Yeah it got slow and  corny, but it was a decent film and Jason Biggs played his part very  well.
Loser is a quaint romantic comedy, there are no American Pie- like  moments.  Be warned that this is a date movie and not a guy movie.",964483200,4,1197,4.25
1265469,2,B00003CXK7,"I went to see 'Loser' thinking it would be like other Amy Heckerling movies (e.g. 'Clueless'), but what I got was a movie that more slow-paced  than 'Down to You', and with few laughs. I smiled a couple of times as  goofy Jason Biggs fell or was humiliated, or when Mena Suvari's character  made some cute remark, but other than, I was bored throughout the movie.  The highlight of it: Cameos by Dan Aykroyd & David Spade. This review  is going to be short, because there's not much to be said about...a Loser.",964396800,2,510,4.440860215053763

1266070,2,B00003CXK7,"From the creator of Fast Times......& Clueless, I sure thought this would have been somewhat original and funny. Only one character was remotely likeable or believable, and that's the young lady from American Pie and American Beauty. Suvari I believe. Just as cute as ever. But Biggs plays for too big of a dolt at the beginning to garner any sympathy or credibility. And why the roommates had to be made out to act and dress like total fairies yet still proclaim to be into girls is ludicrous. And to add more inane drivel to the mix, they're serial rapists. Ha ha ha wow that's always funny, right? And I can understand the storyline about a student having an affair with her teacher, but the way this is acted out is just plain idiotic. Only for the most easily entertained, non-discriminating viewers. There's so many more smart comedies out there. Loser is right. Everyone associated with this movie or acted in it or like it. Blech!",1391558400,,938,4.656626506024097
1266071,4,B00003CXK7,"I've actually had this movie for several years and rediscovered it a couple of days ago.

This was a film that Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari did pretty early in their careers. I didn't think all that much of the film at first, but it really starts to grow on you. The story itself is a classic boy meets girl with some interesting twists and turns. The chemistry between Biggs and Suvari display a comfortability that looks as if their familiarity from American Pie carried over into this movie.

The film has several scenes where Jason Biggs is acting just plain silly, but you are alright with that if you've seen many of his other films where he acts at least mildly goofy. He pulls it off well without looking like a total idiot. In a way, you find him adorable in that nerdy kind of way which in these days works really well. When I think of people who play nerdy and awkward well, I think of Michael Cera. However, it looks as if Cera took his cues from Jason as Biggs does it well here.

Mena is cute and adorable as well in that sort of post punk, mildly sexy girl next door way. She comes off as a little too sweet at times, but it turned out alright. While some might look at this as a step down from her role in American Beauty, I don't see it as such a bad thing. It wasn't really her fault this film didn't do all too well at the box office. This movie was meant to be a ditzy and cute romcom and not a serious, Oscar worthy film. It looks as if it just came at a strange time as we the film industry was starting to move into a time when sci fi and raunchy comedies were a big thing.

Greg Kinnear was passable as the obnoxious professor who tries too hard to be the cool guy. In some respects, it works for the film as his presence feels like it adds some additional star power to the film. Another good addition was Dan Aykroyd, playing the father of Biggs' character. As soon as I saw him on screen, it immediately lent even more credibility to the film.

There are a few scenes that didn't play as well as had been intended. On series of events is when a cat gives birth to a litter of kittens. Continuity is skewered as that litter of kittens goes from being newborns to looking like 4 week olds in a matter of days. It was an obvious error, but then again it's not always easy to procure a fresh litter of kittens without risking the safety of them or their mother.

While it's not an award winner, Loser is still a fun little play date in the sandbox. My only real problem with it now is that I cannot yet replace my old DVD with a Blu Ray version of it.

1266072,3,B00003CXK7,"I agree with most of the reviews on this film.  The three principal actors (Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, and Greg Kinnear) do a very good job with the material that they're given, but for the most part, the plot has a lot of holes that just plain don't make much sense for these characters.  That being said, I want to commend the film for actually giving a very believable look at college life in a big city.

Paul (Jason Biggs) is attending college on a full scholarship with a meal plan.  He has hardly any money, can only go out if he doesn't spend much, and has a suite full of partying roommates that he shares nothing in common with and has to transfer to an off-campus room at a veterinarian clinic due to lack of other options.  Dora (Mena Suvari) is paying her way through college, first at a night club, but is then fired due to not making enough money for the venue.  She spends the majority of the film on a tireless job search, calling every want ad in the paper whether the job fits her or not, because she needs the money to pay for school.  These are the realistic viewpoints and problems of kids trying to attend college in a big city on a budget.  They need a job.  They want to be social and meet people, but can't spend any money.  It was these qualities that reminded me of my own experiences in college in a big city, and it was these things that I could relate to - the everyday struggle to get by financially for the sake of a higher education.

What I could not relate to beyond their very real college environment were their actions in general from time to time.  Dora is way too self-perceptive and smart to be with someone as careless and emotionally vacant as Alcott.  And Paul, while set-up as an overall nice and caring guy, is just too nice to be believed sometimes.  My best example of this is when Paul gives Dora a bouquet of flowers from Alcott when they are really from him.  He likes the girl and hates the guy she's dating because of how he treats her, so why may I ask would he do this?  Not even the nicest guy in the world, no matter how much he likes a girl, would paint the jerk that the girl of his dreams is dating in a favorable light and thereby encourage her to keep seeing said jerk.  Amy Heckerling wrote some very believable characters trying to make their way through college in a very believable way, but simply had them do too many unbelievable things.",1358985600,,2405,4.27373068432671
1266073,5,B00003CXK7,"If you like the movie American Pie and enjoy romantic comedies, I highly recommend Loser. This movie is funny and cute.",1336780800,,119,4.714285714285714
1266074,5,B00003CXK7,It was a cute love story between complete oppisites and it well through out the whole movie.  It was also funny.,1287446400,,112,4.333333333333333
1266075,4,B00003CXK7,"After the success of `American Pie', Jason Biggs was everywhere, and one of the places he showed up was in this 2000 modern spin on the 1960 Oscar winning film `The Apartment'.  Yes, this is very much `The Apartment' set in school, and shockingly this is not as much of an insult to the '60 classic as I would have expected.

Don't get me wrong; `The Apartment' is one of the best films of all time, and `Loser' isn't even one of the best films of 2000, but as far as quirky teenage romantic comedies go, this one actually gets a lot right.

Paul is, well, a loser.  He is a social retard who happens to get a scholarship to a nice college in the city.  Everyone he knows takes total advantage of him, but he's such a nice guy that he constantly allows it.  When he meets, and falls in love with, Dora (a young student  having an affair with her lit professor) he seems to step out of his shell and become his own person, but his interest in Dora is tested with that creepy guy she's sleeping with starts stepping all over his toes.

Biggs is pitch perfect for the role.  I mean, he makes for the perfect dorky romantic lead since he's kind of dorky, but in that Zach Braff `I'm not that attractive yet my geeky sense of humor makes girls love me' kind of way.  I love Mena Suvari and consider her to one of those underrated young actresses who has it all and doesn't get enough opportunities to showcase it (her stunningly astute turn in `American Beauty' should have gotten her Oscar attention) and here she shows why she is so lovable.  She just GETS it, and it shows in her eyes.  She isn't just simply playing a role the way that most actresses would have thrown this one away.  She lives it, and that dedication is admirable, especially when it's coming from a film like `Loser'.

Oh yeah, and for me Greg Kinnear can do no wrong (or very little wrong) and I just gobble him up here.

So, if you are looking for a funny, entertaining and sweetly charming teen comedy that actually knows its humor and its audience and serves up the goods then `Loser' has your DVD player written all over it.

And for the record, he totally should have went with `The Piano'!",1267574400,,2164,4.306172839506173
1266076,3,B00003CXK7,"Paul (Jason Biggs) is a small town doofus who finds himself out of his element when he moves to New York to attend college. A combination of horrible style choices and his unfamiliarity with different cultures doesn't earn him many friends. Sharing a dorm with three party animals (including Zak Orth and Jimmi Simspon), Paul is troubled by the late hours they keep and the language they speak. For example, this is how Orth informs Paul they're having pizza for dinner: ""We're ordering 'za, slap me a big head."" Obviously writer/director Amy Heckerling is trying to recapture the cutting edge teen slang she showcased in 'Clueless', but her efforts seem like a forced attempt to replicate that film's hipness. This isn't the only problem plaguing the film however. Paul meets a free spirited girl named Dora (Mena Suvari) in his English class. He's attracted to her but too shy to strike up a conversation. It is soon revealed that Dora is sleeping with their professor (Greg Kinnear). When Paul learns this he still tries to win her over in ways that are  ridiculous since a major part of the film is how broke him and Dora are. Paul blows his monthly savings on concert tickets to impress her and then buys her flowers but puts the professor's name on the card instead. It's typical romantic comedy crap that makes the film a chore to get through. You know Dora is going to come to her senses and realize what a great guy Paul is and how wrong the professor is for her. It's just that you have to wait for her to realize it which takes nearly the whole movie to get to that logical conclusion. When things do move in that direction so many coincidences occur one right after the other that the film is neither fun nor believable anymore. Biggs and Suvari are both talented actors and likable personalities so they work even when the material doesn't. Kinnear plays a jerk very well as his professor is such a self centered jerk you wonder why Dora is submissive towards him. The funnest performances come from Orth and Simpson as Paul's party monster roommates who do some shocking things to him and others.  It's kind of a cute film with great work from the leads but it's too predictable and tedious to be a good movie.",1253750400,2,2224,4.599496221662468

1266203,4,B00003CXK7,"I had never heard of this film before now, but looking at the cast credits figure it was worth checking out. 'Loser' is far less the misfit school comedy I expected and more of a romantic comedy with a dark undertone. The film really doesn't play up the belly laughs, a more mean spirited tone to the usual high-jinks.  Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari deliver more 3 dimensional characters than most films of this nature.

1266205,4,B00003CXK7,"I like Amy Heckerling's approach a lot.  The story line in her movies really doesn't matter much, it's the characters she builds that make her movies worthwhile and deserving of repeated viewings.

I just saw this flick again a few days ago (for about the 3rd time over the years) and I noticed things about the main and supporting characters I had not seen previously.  The roommates are some of the greatest parodies on college ne'er-do-wells I've ever seen.  And Professor Alcott is more deliciously evil the more you watch this movie.

I went to college a long time ago, but there are elements of the bad characters that do exist I remember, thankfully not so concentrated around one poor guy, but hey movies need to compress things.

The spoiled, self-centered, immoral, rationalizing roomies are hilarious and allow me to laugh even now about some of the stupid attitudes & affectations the ""in crowd"" had when I was in school.  Their desperate clinging to the latest ""cool"" thing is very well done... look carefully at how glammed out these idiots are and think of how much time and effort some people spend trying to be hip and it just ends up making them look like complete a-holes to pretty much everyone including the people they are trying to impress.

So anyway, don't watch Amy Heckerling's movies for story or plot.  Watch for the memorable characters (Spicoli, Cher, Professor Alcott, etc) and try not to act like them in real life or at least use them for comic relief when you encounter some their traits in others.",1199145600,,1533,4.7330827067669174
1266206,3,B00003CXK7,"Loser brings to the screen the story of a college freshman who does not fit in well with his peers nor with the city of NY as a whole.

Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari carry out their roles well, though by no means are these their best performances.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) Jason Biggs not portraying his character as being a ""loser,"" as much as an average guy.  Actually, he seemed to be the only ""normal"" one in the movie!

2) Mena Suvari looked like she is 14 years old and a student at junior high let alone college.

3) Greg Kinnear's (annoying) character OVERDOING it in trying to be conceded and obnoxious (it's a bit much).

4) The poor choice of an actor to play ""Noah"" who is not all man, if you catch my drift...  Any particular reason for that?

5) The other two guys were just not interesting at all nor were they good actors, and all three of them were actually quite sad as opposed to ""cool.""

The setting, the acting, the plot and the humor are average, while the dialogues and the script are rather weak.

In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  No masterpiece here.",1138060800,,1216,4.331858407079646
1266207,3,B00003CXK7,"Although ""Loser"" is a solid effort and is generally enjoyable, it was certainly not what director Amy Heckerling needed at that point in her career. After the great success of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Clueless"" she pretty much went in the director dumper with this one. Ironically the problem was not her directing but her writing. Solid production could not entirely compensate for this flawed screenplay because the flaws are in the characters themselves, they are simply not believable.

This is usually fatal because it is hard for viewers to care about characters with whom they cannot identify. Fortunately for writer Heckerling, director Heckerling cast the best two actors in ""American Pie"", Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari, as her leads. They have such unexpectedly good chemistry together that you will yourself to believe in them, even if Paul is moronically nice and Dora is moronically moronic (her failure to connect the bad relationship dots for almost the entire film is not consistent with a character who is portrayed as extremely perceptive and self-aware). Suvari looks and even sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh which may have you flashing back to ""Fast Times"".

Excellent performances by Biggs, Suvari, and Greg Kinnear (as Professor Alcott) save the day or at least salvage the film. They get little assistance from anyone else in Heckerling's cast (although Dan Ackroyd is decent in a small and very straight role) as the supporting players are either neutral or less than zero. Worst of all are they guys who play Paul's three roommates. They start out as typically ""Party Hard"" college students but overnight morph into date rape scum and academic blackmailers. Heckerling provides nothing to explain this transformation, which is especially strange because she includes early scenes intended to show that one of the roommates is sincerely trying to help Paul with his adjustment to college in the big city.

Heckerling based her ""Clueless"" screenplay on Jane Austin's ""Emma"". Franz Kafka is her reference point for ""Loser""; a strange choice given Kafka famous line ""women are traps which lie in wait for men everywhere, in order to drag them down into the finite"". The choice of the Dora Diamond name is an obvious homage to Kafka's girlfriend Dora Dymant. The screenplay for ""Loser"" is not a total loss, it has good individual lines like: ""I love self-loathing complaint rock you can dance to"".

Perhaps the best scene is Heckerling's homage to the Berkeley fountain scene in ""The Graduate"" as the dejected Paul wonders around the city while the soundtrack plays Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"". The rest of the soundtrack is also good.

Apparently Heckerling could not resist shooting herself in the foot at the very end as she included on-screen notes documenting the comeuppance received by each of the bad characters. Not only is this tired and unoriginal (""American Graffiti"" and ""Animal House"" made use of this along with a high school film I judged last spring) but the notes themselves are not even mildly amusing.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1124409600,10,3112,5.068359375
1266208,3,B00003CXK7,"I caught this movie by accident at a neighborhood theater, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that good old Amy Heckerling had remade one of my favorites, The Apartment, with a dash of Ridgemont High added here and there. Maybe I'm biased because I know and love both of these films, but my guess is that Loser can stand on its own. Or maybe you should do a little homework and watch the original. It can only enhance the experience.",1112572800,,439,4.5
1266209,4,B00003CXK7,"ITS YOUR CLASSIC BAD GUY GOOD GUY - GOOD GUY SAVES GIRL.

THE major thumbs down about this movie was the ""room mates"" and the excess use of gutter language at times. What makes this a GOOD movie though is its realistic presentation of issues.

I find that the honesty between the characters personalities drove the storyline and made for an overall interesting movie with a sarcastic overtone about the worlds rejection of truth, purity and innocence, both displayed in the Professer and the ""room mates"".Also worthy of note is the confusion the misplaced ""MAIDEN IN DISTRESS"" suffers from. Which leaves the masculine viewer completly relating to the ""Loser"" who is clearly the hero of the story.

This would be a good movie to preach from. Leaving out comments made in the movie for SURE but by mainly pointing out the situations and CONSEQUENCES of substance abuse,the possible compromises that can be made all in the name of the $, amoung other youth issues also portrayed in the movie.

IF ANYTHING enjoy the movie, recieve its warm humor and FEEL driven to support the under dog or all round nice guy next time you meet one. WILD AT HEART indeed!

1266210,3,B00003CXK7,"There was just nothing outstanding about this movie. It was like every other teen movie out there, with Jason Biggs as the loveable loser, and Mena Suvari playing the vixen-like Dora, who has her own individual taste in clothes - and is sleeping with her college professor.

You feel sorry for the two main characters in this movie, including Jason's awful hair (is it a wig? is it extensions? is it about to fly away?), and Dora sleeping in an empty train station, because she missed the last bus home, or getting drugged, with what looks like suspiciously like a date-rape drug.

Most of the story is told in the trailer, and there's definitely not going to be any surprises, or twists at the end. The whole university/college stereotype is very OTT, with the drinking, drugs, and everything else, which probably goes on, just not as much as that.

The movie is also very nineties, with the 'Loser' sign (making your fingers into an L, and holding it against your forehead, as shown on cover) which just about everyone does at some point during the movie. The soundtrack is very typically nineties too, including the #1 hit from Wheatus (whatever happened to them?) ""Teenage Dirtbag"", being the main song. Some more of the more memorable songs include: ""What's My Age Again"" by Blink 182; ""Blue"" by Eiffel 65; ""Bad Touch"" by The Bloodhound Gang; ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" by Offspring; ""Magna Cum Nada"" by The Bloodhound Gang; ""She's So High"" by Tal Bachman (more recently done by Norway's Pop Idol winner, who I forget the name of, but he was damn ugly!); and ""Scarborough Fair"" by Simon & Garfunkel.

This is an average movie, written and directed by Amy Heckerling of Clueless fame. I just hope Clueless is better than this.",1109548800,2,1732,4.706270627062707

Instead he has 2 freaky roommates who border on criminals (they use date rape drugs?) and nobody to help him out.
The professor and college student romance is equally creepy.  The whole movie is so dysfunctional that I cringed so often my back hurt.  There is zero chemistry between biggs and suvari.  Its more like she pitied him more than anything else.",1070496000,2,599,4.4

The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this.

If I acted like a proper  reviewer and kept a more critical edge to my review, it would get only 4 stars though.  It is a pretty good movie, a tremendously ""cute"" romantic comedy.  The actors are not taking themselves too seriously (which is important in such a film) while getting the viewer to care for them.  Amy Heckerling's dialogue is perfect for a romantic teen comedy.  The only problem is that it doesn't live up to its spiritual predecessor, Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"".  It brings a nice twist, but it doesn't have as much symbolism as Wilder's.  While ""The Apartment"" stays a great classic due to its depiction of the post-war, consumerism era, it seems that ""Loser"" has no dense message other than go-for-the-nice-guy.  All I'm saying is that while it is a fun, nice comedy, it doesn't have as much impact as its predecessor.  But you should definitely check it out, it's worth it.",1053475200,,998,4.556179775280899
1266374,2,B00003CXK7,"Now, having a terrible, terrible guilty pleasure that is the ""teen movie"" genre, I am normally a rave reviewer of these films.  I did not like this movie.  I liked the cast, I liked the idea, but I just couldn't get in to the movie.
Jason Biggs plays ""Paul Tannek,"" a transplant from the sticks, who is awkward in his New York City surroundings.  Mena Suvari plays ""Dora Diamond,"" the ""independent thinker"" who is having an affair with the Greg Kinnear character, Professor Alcott.
This is the preverbal ""root for the little guy"" kind of film.  Paul Tannek is a little geek  falls in love with the girl, Dora, who is already taken. And worse yet, the girl is love with the big, mean professor, who doesn't really care about her.  Paul does his best to steer the girl away from the professor, while not trying to show how sleazy the professor really is.  He plays this wonderfully chivalrous guy, who is completely annoying, not very funny, and downright boring.
Boredom was probably the main downfall to this movie.  There was a pretty hefty lack of plot.  Where you would expect more conflict to begin, it did not.  Where there should have been drama, there was not. . . Where there was supposed to be a movie, there was not.  There was a great deal of potential in this movie, as the cast was strong, but the movie fell flat.

1266375,3,B00003CXK7,"As far as Jason Biggs movies go, this movie isn't as good as American Pie but it's better than Saving Silverman (like that's hard to do). Although I like the movie, there were some weird things going on. For instance, why did Dora (Mena Suvari) agree to go on a date with Paul (Jason Biggs) when she already had a boyfriend? There were also a lot of loose ends, like when Dora was trying to get financial aid, she couldn't get it because she didn't have a residence. Didn't she miss her subway home earlier in the movie? If she didn't have a residence, then where was she going?
Aside from all that, the movie is pretty watchable. A lot of things that happen to Paul probably wouldn't happen in real life'at least, I hope not. And this movie is more of a comedy-drama than a straight comedy, so keep that in mind before you see it.

His roommates are really bad guys to hang around with. However, he meets this nice girl there and begins to fall for her because of how they're spending time together as good friends. Unfortunately, she dates their college professor. Luckily, the end is good for them both which is where the romantic part comes in. And the most important thing for Jason Biggs's part was to be himself and make the right choices.
I actually feel that I'm in his spot as well at the beginning.
I enjoyed how it went with the comedy, romance, and the drama of the two main characters and so I thought it was a very good movie.",1030924800,,764,4.387323943661972
1266377,2,B00003CXK7,"Jason Bigges and Mena Suvari are more or less likable in this film, and once you have noted that, there is virtually nothing else good to say about this film. Most of the other characters are intensely dislikable, and just about all the comedy is distinctly unfunny.
Director Amy Heckerling previously directed two of the best teen films of the past two decades: FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and CLUELESS. The latter was an inspired updating and adaptation of Jane Austen's EMMA. THE LOSER is also an adaptation, the plot of being borrowed fairly straightforward from Billy Wilder's THE APARTMENT. Bigges plays the Jack Lemmon role, Mena Suvari the Shirley MacLaine role, and Greg Kinnear the Fred MacMurray. The adaptation of Jane Austen worked in part because it was an inspired idea to reset EMMA in a Los Angeles high school in the 1990s, and in part because the script was so marvelous. The idea of resetting THE APARTMENT at NYU in the late 1990s fails in the first place because it is a really bad idea to remake one of cinema's greatest and funniest movies and in the second place because the script for the remake was so very, very unfunny. EMMA and CLUELESS were dissimilar as art forms (novel versus film) so that they didn't admit of very close comparison; THE APARTMENT and THE LOSER are both comic films set in NYC in the twentieth century, so they compare very easily. And, of course, THE APARTMENT makes THE LOSER look very, very bad indeed.
But to be truthful, THE APARTMENT doesn't really make THE LOSER look much worse than it would have otherwise. It just isn't a very inspired film on any level. I liked the characters played by Bigges and Suvari, but after that, there wasn't really anything else recommending the film. In particular, Greg Kinnear's superficial, sadistic, and self-centered professor was especially damaging to the film.
So, instead of watching this miserable remake of THE APARTMENT, just go watch THE APARTMENT again instead.",1027123200,,1966,4.836795252225519
1266378,3,B00003CXK7,"Other than the relatively benign and flip manner the script deals with the serious issue of date rape drugs, the movie is entertaining. The acting is good, it is filmed and directed very well, and the script features mostly non-canned dialouge (even if the plot itself is wearily familiar).
No one else has said it and I believe it's worth mentioning: the music is great!",1016841600,,371,4.723076923076923
1266379,3,B00003CXK7,"""Loser"" ....  What an unappealing title!  That's what I thought first, and still I believe that with another word(s), the film could have received better chance of being watched.  At least, it's Amy Heckerling's film, and she is the director of terrific ""Clueless.""  But THAT was a clueless title, too.
""Loser"" is, of course, a blaff title, and Jason Biggs's character Paul, coming from country to New York City with a prop borrowed  from ""Fargo,"" finally wins.  Wins the heart of Dora (lovely, cute Mena Suvari), and supposed to win our heart, too.  But before that, he let himself suffer too much, and that's the point we find it hard to accept.  During the first several days of some college life in New York City, Paul, being too nice, finds his study interrupted by other noisy, party-loving roommates; finds his bed ruined by a broken waterbed; finds his textbook glued (by you know who); and, being fooled by them,  finds himself virtually evicted from the dorm to find his room among a hospital for cats and dogs.  Even Jason Biggs' good-natured personality cannot help there.
But still, we know he is going to be a winner, and wait.  Here comes Dora, clad in a flashy costume but with a heart of diamond.  And waiting turns out worthwhile, for the chemisty between Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs is strong and hearty enough to carry the whole show.  Of course, they don't know each other well at first, but WE know they will be attracted to each other sooner or later.  Biggs & Suvari, both so good in ""American Pie"" (though they got different parters: Suvari with Chris Klein, and Biggs with ... pie), they deserve special mention here as one of the best couples that captured our heart on the big screen.
Amy Heckerling, however, takes too much time before the final payoff.  Dora loves a pretentious college professor Greg Kinnear, who uses and wastes her love at every opportunity he can find.  The teacher-student relations have been explored in various forms in movie history (from Doris ""Teacher's Pet"" Day to Drew ""Never Been Kissed"" Barrymore), but Heckerling is brave in depicting this controversial relation straightforward.  But the film somehow ends up with unsatisfactory results, making selfish Prof. Kinnear just another foil he played several times since remake of ""Sabrina,"" and making Suvari look foolish to be deeply attracted to this unpleasant follow.  And worst of all is, hey, Paul, why do you help this guy out?
With some moody photography of New York, ""Loser"" is a fairly enjoyable fare, but not without troubles.  But the two leads are so good and likable that if you like this kind of romatic film with slight comedy touch, you may love it.  I find it very hard to hate the film (though really wish I hadn't known Mena Suvari's marriage beforehand), and if not as good as ""Clueless,"" ""Loser"" is, in the long run, almost ""Winner.""  Almost.
There's some cameo appearances including Dan Aykroyd and David Spade, but the original cast of Broadway musical ""Cavaret"" is a real treat.  Yes, it's the wrong act shown in the film, and Paul and Dora, who must have sneaked in the theater, are sitting at an expensive table!  Guys, you usually get caught before sitting there, I'm afraid, but, okay, I shut up, for we can briefly see Alan Cumming as Emcee.  And the inside of the subway is, according to my material at hand, shot in Toronto, because of Jason Biggs' tight schedule.",1016755200,,3404,4.75

My favorite part of the movie, though, were the bad guys, the loser's three room mates.  I found it hard to get mad at them just because they were so rotten they were actually very funny.",1013472000,,436,4.2926829268292686
1266520,3,B00003CXK7,"A couple of years ago, Heckerling made critics stand up and take notice of teen movies once again with her fantastically witty, funny 'Clueless'.  Her next movie, 'Loser', seemed to go by pretty much unnoticed, surprising really given the director's and actors' credentials.  Basically this is a cute movie that is above average.  It's about a smalltown guy named Paul (Jason Biggs) who goes to university and finds out that everything he feared about university was true; he doesn't have any friends, finds it difficult to cope with the work etc.  Then he meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a grungy student that's carrying out an affair with one of her tutors (Greg Kinnear).  And so it goes as Paul tries to get the unattainable girl.
First of all, there's much about this film to admire, and it's mostly clich-free.  First of all there are the actors: Jason Biggs plays basically the same guy as he did in 'American Pie' so well, the goofy but loveable geek.  There's also Suvari, of 'American Beauty' fame, who is just fantastic in this role as an angst-ridden teen trying to make ends meet.  The supporting cast are also impressive.  It's also funny in several bits, and not in an obvious way - this is a movie whose characters almost seem to revel in their own oddities.  We've got Dora funding her course through harvesting her eggs and Paul teaching her the finer points of catching food in your mouth.
However, the movie eventually goes for the easy option, straying into the territory of dreary teen movies like 'She's All That'.  Dora is never really that unattainable, we're assured that her boyfriend is a bad person by his obvious affairs and at the end Paul has a sudden transformation - look what a haircut can do to a person, not only can it boost your confidence but it can also transform you into the leading-man within.  Until the end though, it's a cute, witty little movie.  Just miss off the last five minutes and you'll be fine.",1011398400,2,1944,4.665689149560118

Jason Biggs gave one of his best performances. He basically plays an extremely naive guy who moves to NY to go to college, and he dosen't quite fit in. He meets a lovely young girl who is having an affair with one of her college professors. Anyhow, the two bond, and eventually fall in love.

1266523,2,B00003CXK7,"Amy Heckerling's follow up to the cult favorite ""Clueless"" fell flat.  There really isn't much to hate or to love about this bland post high school coming of age flick.

Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs- American Pie) plays an awkward, socially inept farm boy, who packs up and moves to NYC to attend college at NYU on a full scholarship.  Armed with good intentions, he struggles to fit in and make friends. His three roomates are the party animals your parents warned you about.  They soon turn on him for reasons that are quite simplistic (though this seems to be a pre-req for any buuble gum film that incorporates school).

Meanwhile, Paul meets Dora (Mena Suvari) in class where he develops a huge crush on her.  She is the oblivious young female paradigm I have grown so tired of. She is having an affair with their (arrogant and swarmy) teacher (Greg Kinnear).

Bored yet?

The movie is cute, but does not ultimately hold your attention, nor does it draw you into the characters.  None of the characters were unique, though Jason and Mena were somewhat likeable in a very generic sort of way.  I wish Heckerling would have made the movie more comedic, so as to draw attention away from the weak plot and the uninteresting characters.  I can enjoy fluff films with the best of them.

The problem is that she's dating the Lit professor (who's a real jerk).  The story goes as you'd expect and they finally get a bit romantic at the end.  Nothing too special, but it does make for some good laughs.  The best part of the movie, I'd have to say, was the music.  Alas, I can't think of a single title off the top of my head, but I remember quite clearly that the soundtrack rocked.

The ironic references to Mena Suvari's most iconic role - 'American Beauty' - expose the paedophilia driving that work's sentimentality.

Jason biggs does a good job playing a loser.  Mena Suvari i really liked as the character of Dora.  She's nice and knows how to have fun without spending 30$.  There is a good chemistry between Biggs and Suvari more likely due to the fact they worked toghether before.  Greig Kinnear plays the unlikable boyfriend professor.

The drama element isn't engaging enough to sustain throughout the movie and the comedy and laughs are few and far between. Surprisingly, this movie works best a romance. The chemistry between Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs is great, probably because they worked together on 1999's way better American Pie, but the disappointing thing about the romance is that it doesn't burst out until the end, predictably. If Loser had maybe tried something different and not gone the same way as all the other teen movies in the past 3 years, I would of enjoyed it more. I still found Biggs and Suvari entertaining as a couple, but Suvari surprisingly over-does her character in many scenes, while Greg Kinnear gives a dumb performance as the bastard professor. The rest of the leading cast, Zak Orth, Thomas Sadoski and Jimmi Simpson aren't as funny or memorable as Jim Carrey's 3 sons in Me, Myself & Irene.

1266665,1,B00003CXK7,"This film is Not the Raucous College Comedy that the Preview showed us, it is a Bland, Lifeless, Wannabe Romantic Comedy. Totally Humorless, Mostly Torturous, It's a Real Comedy Dead Zone.
Amy Heckerling has misfired Majorly on this one, after ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Clueless"" being the Likeable, Fun Films that they are, her latest effort is even more of a Disappointment. We all have the Right to expect more from her, and with ""Loser""; our expectations are far from met.
A few jokes here and there aren't much to ask, but the lame script denies them. The Attempts at Comedy are either Done to Death, Cruel, Ill-Timed, Poorly Executed or just plain Stupid. The Only time I even Heard Laughter was when Jason Biggs falls down the steps, which is in the Preview (trust me, I didn't laugh). Fall Over Humor, when done with the greatest of care and restraint, can be a Comedic Goldmine, but only if it's done Maturely. Here it is done Amateurishly.
Jason Biggs looks Embarrassed, Mena Suvari looks Bored. Greg Kinnear is a Breath of Fresh Air as a Lecturer who causes some trouble for our would-be Love Birds. He manages a few Chuckles without really trying and he makes the movie almost Bearable. (and I Stress the word Almost)
If you feel you still have to see it to make up your own mind, consider yourself fore-warned. ""Loser"" will make you Laugh, Cry and Cheer... For All the Wrong Reasons.",985046400,,1406,4.650602409638554
1266756,4,B00003CXK7,"I was shocked at all the bad reviews for this film...first off, Amy Heckerling is a great director and with the exception of Look Who's Talking Too, has delivered nothing but great movies. I wasn't too fond of the previews when this film first came out, and told myself that I wouldn't bother watching it, as most of America did, evident through the film's poor box-office performance...surprising that not even the star power of Jason and Mena, fresh of the success of American Pie saved this one at the box office, although I thought that Heckerling's name might make a difference....it didnt....anyway, I finally caught this at a friends house one boring afternoon and surprise surprise, I didn't just like it, I really loved it...it was an enjoyable and fun movie...its not really funny, but it is sweet, I absolutely fell in love with Jason Bigg's character....dont we wish all guys were that great??? I will definitely recommend this film, it was great...",983750400,,961,4.901840490797546

Those roomate jerks that Paul has are all great (yeah, yeah...), and Mena'a carictor is way better than that sweet virgin thing she did in ""American Pie"". Also there's great, solid music all around, but for some reason there's no soundtrack (!).

1266758,3,B00003CXK7,"Perhaps the title I gave this review is a tad unfair. Loser is actually a very fun movie. I enjoyed it. It took me back to my freshmen year of college. It made me think fondly about crushes I had on girls, problems I had with teachers, not having enough financial aid and the idiot students that shouldn't even be able to pass a litmus test much less a college entrance exam. I identified with this movie. My inner college student identified with it the same way my inner high school student identified with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""
However, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Clueless"" (Amy Heckerling's other major blockbuster) have a special humor that ""Loser"" is lacking. In truth, I identified with ""Loser"" much more than I did with ""Clueless"", however the script is much more subdued. In some ways, this is a good thing. After Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari both achieved critical acclaim with their breakout roles in ""American Pie"" and went on to star in the likes of  ""Boys and Girls"" and ""American Beauty"" respectively, its nice to see that they are dynamic enough in their ranges as actors to perform in a simple, more subdued film.
This movie is just that. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Girl doesn't notice how sweet boy is. Boy attempts to sacrifice his own happiness for the girls sake. Girl and boy eventually end up together. I'm sorry if I have spoiled anything for you, but trust me, you've seen this film before. You've seen this film many times. You know the entire story the first time you see the sweet and lovable doofus look into the eyes of the cool and outrageous babe. You're supposed to know. It isn't the plot that's important here. Its the details. Its not the ending. Its how you get there. And how we get there in Loser is charming and touching, Its just the thing that you want for a lazy Sunday evening date at home, cuddling with your sweetie.
Aside from Jason Biggs straining to portray a decent sweet guy and Mena Suvari straining to play a character who is not a virgin (I'm joking, actually Biggs and Suvari do a fine job of working outside of their stereotypical roles), the film also features Greg Kinnear, leaving his usual nice-guy role to play the arrogant Professor and cameos by Steven Wright, Dan Akroyd, Andy Dick, David Spade and Everclear.
This isn't going to be remembered as an Amy Heckerling masterpiece, but you could do a lot worse than to watch this (for instance you could watch Look Who's Talking Too).",983232000,,2479,4.583333333333333

1266760,1,B00003CXK7,"The title is just too apropos.  Loser is a loser of a film, and I'm by no means surprised that it ended up on several critics' ""Worst of 2000"" lists.
Let's start with the cast.  Jason Biggs is an okay actor, but the question is how difficult is it to act like a bafoon and trip repeatedly?  His talent is not rare in Hollywood.  And then there is the sinfully overrated Mena Suvari, who portrays Dora with all the depth and range of a kindergarten student.  She's not that attractive and she certainly has yet to prove that she can act.  Third, Greg Kinnear is way too talented to be in Loser.  His work in As Good As It Gets is almost marred by his tepid efforts in this goobled gurk.
Second, the characters are a tad too one-dimensional for my taste.  While writer/director Amy Heckerling makes it painfully obvious that Paul's roommates are the real losers, she also exposes the fact that she knows very little about college life.  Drinking games played while watching Rhoda reruns?  Not at my university.  Also, Dora and Paul have zero chemistry.  Sadly, most of the relational focus is shifted towards Dora and her teacher (Kinnear).  Their relationship almost makes more sense because of the undue attention it receives.
Finally, the movie is just plain awful.  The writing stems from the seventh circle of cliche Hell, the directing is abominably unimaginative, and the actors play dumb, almost as if they're hoping that their next respective projects will be winners.",980726400,3,1475,4.733333333333333
1266761,4,B00003CXK7,"I'm a Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari fan.  I heard about this movie from my nephew who just simply said Biggs is in it.  Well, after seeing it all the way through, it totally touched me.  I saw myself there being portrayed as an ""innocent, naive yet honest"" young kid back in high school.  Not to sound selfish, but it's happened to all of us.  Biggs' character touched me and almost made me sobbed when his big plan with Suvari's character, as in pizza and a movie night, went caput.  Imagine how much anxiety, excitement and the glow Paul Tannek a.k.a Biggs had while he prepared for a really beautiful moment.  It's something I did with a girlfriend only to find out that my heart broke when I found her with someone else.  That wasn't really cool.  Anyway, this movie is one of the greatest feel-good flicks I've ever seen.  A permanent conversation piece within my friends.  Amy Heckerling's first ""drama"" so to speak that really touches and warms the heart.  Oh yeah, the video bonus was filmed at my high school in Los Angeles which also served as the backdrop for ""Clueless"".",979171200,3,1080,4.538860103626943

1266763,3,B00003CXK7,"I have been reading the reviews here, and I guess this movie was not received very well.  I thought it was a cute, charming, comedy with romance thrown in.  The film stars Jason Biggs as Paul, fresh from American Pie, and Mena Suvari as Dora, who was covered in rose petals in American Beauty.  They are being portrayed as the ""Losers"" of the film, but after watching the roommates who tortured Paul for not being like them and for having a girl pay attention to him without help from a PILL slipped into her drink, we all find out who the real losers are.
Greg Kinnear plays the professor that Dora is having an affair with, just so she can have a residence.  He doesn't end up being a very good guy in this film, which is what I was used to seeing him as, but he does a good job in his role.
While this isn't one of the best movies of the year, it had some charm to it and I recommend it for a romantic comedy rental..A good date movie.",978393600,3,938,4.109289617486339
1266764,4,B00003CXK7,"I rented this movie on a snowy day along with several other films and was pleasantly surprised.  I was looking for something light and fun and that is exactly what I got.
Jason Biggs, who played the charming but goofy lead in American Pie, is Paul a guy who moves from the mid-west to New York City to go to College and is immeadiately overwhelmed by ""city"" life.  His roomates are horrible and only add to his inability to fit in.
In class Paul meets Dora, Mena Suvari - who was also in American Pie as well as American Beauty.  As Paul gets to know Dora he begins to see that life in the big city is not all bad.  Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear were all good in this movie - the plot was not as strong as most of Amy Heckerling's past high school type comedy's such as Fast Time or Clueless but this film was still cute.

1266874,1,B00003CXK7,"Oh boy!  This movie flat out sucked.  So Jason Biggs plays this guy, Paul, who is moving to New York City for his first year of school.  He gets there and he can't make any friends.  His roommates are down right mean to him and no one else  will give him the time of day.  Except for Dora (Mena Suvari).  She's a nice girl just trying to make her way in the world.  He falls in love with her.  Big surprise!  Too bad she's having an affair with her jerk of a professor (Greg Kinnear).
My biggest problem with this film is that Paul is not a loser.  He's a regular nice guy.  It's just that his roommates are a bunch of jerks.  They're not just mean; they're cruel.  So instead of laughing, I felt bad for Paul.  It made me sad.  That wasn't what the movie was trying to do.  His roommates are also date rapists, but that's all I have to say about that.
Mena Suvari's character, Dora, is just an idiot.  First of all, her favorite band is Everclear.  Warning bells went off right there.  She works in a strip club as a drink girl and is offended when guys hit on her.  Get with the program babe!  What did you think was gonna happen?  She wastes her time with Greg Kinnear.  The list goes on and on.
Amy Heckerling sure did a slipshod job on this film.  The characters are all unappealing and the plot is rehashed, not to mention the fact that I didn't laugh once.  This was the most unenjoyable film of the year.",977961600,,1412,4.137037037037037

This movie isn't even funny on accident. Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari may both be talented, but no one could make a good movie out of this script.

1266877,4,B00003CXK7,"Amy Heckerling's latest teen comedy, 'Loser', is an old-fashioned charmer where nice guys finish first, sweet girls end up making the right choices, and pushy 'users' get their just desserts! Perhaps nobility is passe in films today, but 'Loser' makes a great case for working class heroes who succeed by 'doing the right thing'.
Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs) is a farm boy who wins a scholarship to a college in New York City. Bright, awkward, and shy, and possessing the worst haircut since Adam Sandler's in 'Little Nicky', he accepts his family's celebration of his success with embarrassment, and a fear of failure, but his father (Dan Aykroyd, who is wonderful in his brief scenes) offers simple advice: ""Listen to people, look them in the eye. Be a friend, and you'll succeed.""
Cut to New York City (which has never looked more beautiful), and Paul's worst fears are coming true. His dress is ridiculed, his roommates are 'too cool' jerks who take advantage of him while dissing him, and his instructors, particularly Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear, at his smarmiest!) snub him imperiously. Paul is lonely and frustrated, which makes a simple act of kindness by fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, in her best performance, to date) take on special significance to him. Diamond is a kindred spirit, although she has been manipulated into believing Professor Alcott loves her, and has become his clandestine lover.
As both of their lives take downward turns (he gets thrown out of his dorm, she loses her waitress job), they develop a platonic friendship (he is far too much a gentleman to attempt to break up a relationship!). He becomes her 'guardian angel', protecting her, and the film becomes a guessing game of when she will finally realize they belong together!
'Loser' features a lot of very funny cameos, by Andy Dick, David Spade, Andrea Martin, Colleen Camp, many others, and, to Heckerling's credit, these 'guests' never detract from the positive message of the film.
This makes a great date movie (particularly if your date loves kittens!), and is a 'feel-good' flick you can enjoy again and again! I loved it, and I think you will, too!",976320000,10,2157,4.9449035812672175

I actually lost a lot of intrest in the movie from the beginning, and I only thought worse things would occur. Whenever a funny moment came, it never felt funny! The jokes didn't seem to fit in at the right moment. But soon after, the movie did get better. When Jason Biggs' and Mena Suvari's characters become friedly with each other, that's when I feel the movie picks up the pace. The movie actually began to catch my intrest. When I first heard of ""Loser"" before I saw it, I thought it would of been more then what I saw. I thought it was going to be this cute teen comedy. But possibly because the style was too much out there or the jokes never seemed to fit, I felt dissapointed. It wasn't this cute teen comemdy I expected at all.

More like Fast Times than Clueless; Loser shines with  heart and confidence.  the movie doesn't promote itself as a comedy, more  like a romantic dramedy, without losing its perceptive. Loser rebuilds your  faith that there is actually life after high school comedies.  Obvisously  many people will have the expectations that the movie is asking the  audience to laugh at Jason Bigg's character Paul, and (duh) think that he  is a Loser, when really the movie is showing how shallow and what losers  are people who arn't themselves.",966643200,2,776,4.9765625
