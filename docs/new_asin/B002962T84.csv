8357580,3,B002962T84,"Given that the heroic struggle of Poles as resistance fighters and members of the Polish armed forces serving with allies in both the Western and Eastern fronts is hardly touched upon I expected something more substantial.

Apart from being well acted and suspenseful the viewer becomes irritated with the jumbled chronology of events through constant editing.  That only works for an artsy feature film not a ten part television series.  Also historically it was suspect.  For one, while the Polish Resistance was in contact with the German Resistance Movement (such that it was) it is unlikely that a German national would have a powerful role in co-ordinating Polish/English/American espionage activities within the occupied territories.  Also there was no mention of the Polish First and Second Armies fighting alongside Soviet troops who marched into Germany proper and participated in the taking of Berlin.  They also figured prominently in destroying the Polish Home Army by conscripting its members into their ranks and exiling or executing its leadership.

The ending was absolutely pathetic and beyond stupid as we watch several minutes of the hero in Polish uniform searching for his beloved somewhere in post war Germany only to drive right past her and not hearing her calling out to him.  Unhappy endings make for a good feature film not for a drawn out ten part serial with numerous characters (Polish, German, Russian, American and British).  If it was not for the constant editing taking us back to 1939 and then to 1940 and then to 1944 with several characters involved in the plot this might have been a decent production worthy of international distribution.",1324425600,,1678,5.162361623616236
