Lead actress Naomi Nishida launched her film career with this, a performance that's wacky and charming.",1223510400,,300,4.788461538461538
8131386,4,B000GFLKHG,"This is a very funny japanese comedy. The plot basically concerns a young woman's search for a treasure (she worked as a bank teller, and she saw the robbery's money being sunk on a pit in the forest after being abducted) and the extent to what she will go to recover it. This summary does not do justice to the movie's brillian humor. Specially funny is main actress Naomi Nishida deadpan performance.",1170633600,5,402,4.597222222222222
