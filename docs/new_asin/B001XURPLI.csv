8347737,1,B001XURPLI,"The most surprising thing about this video is that the people involved in its making actually put their names in the credits.  The story was disjointed and further harmed by the commentary of the ""reporter/narrator"".  The photography used the same scenes many times.  The most overused video shot was a dark picture of the back of the head of a soldier sitting in the front seat of a Humvee taken from the backseat of a Humvee.  The narrator kept using the phrase ""Bagdad happens"" ad nauseum throughout the video.  I could go on and on but this amazingly poor video is not worth the number of words I have already taken the time to type.  I would suggest you skip this one.  If you do not want to take my word, it does not cost much money to waste your time.

I cannot explain the favorable review of this video except that it may have been written by someone with clouded objectivity.",1348358400,,885,4.419753086419753
8347738,5,B001XURPLI,"This video is one small, but accurate and intriguing snapshot of events that happened in Baghdad during the surge in May 2007.

The events J.D. Johannes portrays happened as he says they did. I know because I was there (not on the raid itself) in the unit he was embedded with and sat in on the after action review (AAR). Johannes was in the proverbial right place at the right time to witness the events unfold as they did.

It's not a film filled with explosions and intense firefights, but it will give you a raw, unfiltered look at ""a day in the life"" of an infantry company on the ground in a sectarian hotspot and how the Soldiers not only coped with the challenges of combat, but how trained, alert and disciplined troops all pulled together to bring down a thug who was doing his part to terrorize a neighborhood. These types of operations played out repeatedly for our brigade over a period of 15 months while we were there, but in this instance, everything came together at the right time for Johannes to bring you the cause and effect like few films about the Iraq war can.",1250208000,,1084,4.442211055276382
