2163079,5,B00062J02G,"Talk about your series of unfortunate events!  Scriptwriter Daniel Handler (the man behind Lemony Snicket) delivers up a thoroughly adult tale of power, greed, lust, innocence lost, and seemingly foreordained tragedy in Rick.  The movie may be patterned on Verdi's opera Rigoletto, yet the presentation of this story is uniquely memorable; it's a brilliant, intelligent, quirky dark comedy/morality tale that really should be a cult classic.  Bill Pullman has finally made a believer out of me; I don't know why I have found it somewhat difficult to like him in the past, but he's really zoomed up my personal rankings of actors with his effort here.  He may well be the only actor that could have pulled this role off to the maximum effect - it's a nuanced, quirky performance that samples just about all of the spectrums of modern life.  When we first meet Rick, he's a jerk - pure and simple.  Some viewers seemingly never got over that, but for me, this character quickly developed into a likeable, albeit unfortunate, human being filled with regrets yet seemingly trapped in a persona that he truly abhors in his heart.  His love for his late wife emerges through his interaction with his somewhat wayward daughter Eve (Agnes Bruckner - and let me just say that the mental image I associate with the name Agnes has now been put completely on its head), and his contempt for his boss and co-workers - and thereby himself - becomes increasingly obvious.

Rick's boss Duke (Aaron Stanford), aka BigBoss, is a complete jerk and a pervert.  When he and Rick are together, it's all fun and games, a contest to see who can step on more of the little people around them.  The vindictiveness we see in Rick's character is fuelled by his secret hatred of Duke, who is young enough to be his son.  In the tradition of reaping what you sow, Rick is inflicted with a ""Chinese curse"" by a young lady (Sandra Oh) whom he humiliated in an interview before also getting her fired from her current job.  Before he can even laugh that threat off, a former college buddy shows up out of nowhere offering to help Rick get to the top.  When the BigBoss is a kid, there's really only one surefire method of getting him out of the way of your professional development.  Rick wants no part of such nonsense, but his reasoning changes as his life proceeds to come apart at the seams.  In a real sense, all he has in his life is his daughter Eve, and she's something of a handful.  Things develop in such a way that, for personal as well as business reasons, Rick wants Duke to disappear.

It's true that the ending doesn't exactly jump out at you and surprise you, but a good movie is not defined by a good, surprising conclusion - it's how you get to that conclusion, and Rick (the film) forges an unforgettable path from here to there.  It's a dark comedy that morphs into a tragedy, and I found it incredibly compelling from beginning to end - and, as far as I'm concerned - it's brilliantly done.  A lot of the humor is quick and subtle, but it all contributes to a virtual pillaging of business as usual in the modern world.  Odd but effective camera angles and a disquieting soundtrack made up of darkly modified Christmas tunes effects a surreal atmosphere for the drama that unfolds, marking Rick as a definite modern morality play.  The writing is sharp, incisive, biting, and wonderfully interconnected, with Handler tying ever plot element together in a way few writers can match.  This is a brilliant motion picture that does not deserve its current state of obscurity.",1122681600,6,3560,4.644338118022328
2163080,5,B00062J02G,"One of the better, darker comedies I've seen in a long time. Pullman was great as Rick. I wouldn't say anyone over-acted considering that this film is parodic in nature. Doubly so actually. Parody of Rigoletto AND corporate culture. Subtly can be left at the door with dark comedies. It's like a cross between Office Space and Very Bad Things. I loved the presentation of the film, a dark gothic set and camera angles that parallel the twisted nature of the plat and its characters(a la Batman). I'm going to keep an eye on director Curtiss Clayton in the future.",1112486400,2,563,4.64
2163081,4,B00062J02G,"Here's an ultra-clever piece of work that deserves more than its current obscure status.  Based on Rigoletto, this whipsnap of a movie casts Bill Pullman as the title character with the improbable last name of O'Lette (just to make sure you don't miss the reference), a nasty SOB with a megabucks Wall Street job who treats people like slime and at the same time has to grovel to a boss 20 years his junior.  The boss, Duke (beginning to get the picture here?) is an immature rich kid jerk who lusts after Rick's daughter, and is married to a dimbulb woman almost as dense as he is.

Enter Buck, with whom Rick went to business school, and who has a business that speciailizes in reducing the earth's population--one person at a time.  He promises to wipe out whomever Rick chooses for a mere 10 grand.  Rick has a pretty good idea of who that would be.  And of course, this being an opera-based neo-noir tale, things don't exactly go according to plan.  Reminiscent of Fargo and Shock to the System--in fact, you could say this is a pretty nifty fusion of those two edgy films--Rick's smarts (that is, the film's intelligence, not the main character's) shines through in almost every scene.  A few small missteps here and there, but nothing serious, this is another film that has a lot of fun slapping you in the face and watching your reaction.

Hurts so good.  Nice piece of work from writer Dan Handler who wrote the Lemony Snicket thing; looks like he specializes in nasty characters who get their come-uppance and then some.  I especially like the back and forth of the one-syllable names at the bar--""Rick"", ""Mick"", ""Buck"", ""Jack"", ""Duke""--very snappy, as though the F word is being hurtled from one guy to another (yeah, it's a guy thing) ceaselessly.

Definitely recommended.  If you like Shock to the System, Fargo, Office Killer, and probably one or two other black comedies I can't think of the names of right now, you'll dig this one.

Snappy.",1108684800,11,1956,4.664723032069971
2163082,4,B00062J02G,"Sandra Oh has IT. The girl can do comedy and drama. As a woman degraded, she casts a witch's curse that propels this pop Rigoletto in which the soundtrack is a sensuous mix of Christmas carols that underscore the psychological drama directly as well as ironically. (I'm buying the soundtrack next!)The script with it revealing cliches of office dialog and 4-letter names that are used like 4-letter words is music to my literary ears. Too many producers forget that a film begins with writing. The last, but not least revelation, was Bill Pullman's self-lacerating performance that recalls the conflicted icon Jack Lemmon in ""The Apartment."" Having never really cared for Pullman before, I hesitated when I saw the billing. But the guy made a believer out of me with his muttering performance depicting a man who was once good, and who was whittled away by urban violence and corporate hypocrisy. Aaron Stanford as Duke, the Bigboss, gives the kind of performance that gets Supporting Actor nominations. His character is an archetype of our times, because he chatters on in halls and on line all the while he is gorgeously clueless regarding his superficiality, his wife, and his employees. For an interesting double feature, watch this film with ""Rodger Dodger."" Or, pair this serious film with another Christmas-driven movie for grown-ups, the hilarious comedy ""The Ref.""",1103068800,5,1373,5.1066666666666665
2163083,5,B00062J02G,"I just read the reviews on this page for this film and i am flabbergasted.  I loved this movie. i thought it was a film that finally dealt with issues that no one talks about, Cybersex, death of a parent and how it affects teenagers, and the fact that in this day and age you can easily end up working for someone half you age who will dominate your life.  i strongly recommend people to see this film, you won't regret it.",1101772800,2,423,4.146341463414634
2163084,5,B00062J02G,"This movie is amazing. It hits at the right time when corporate america is so corrupt.  Bill Pullman gives an amazing performance as the title character of RICK! Anyone who has ever had to deal with a younger and arrogant boss will enjoy this film for here fantasy becomes reality.  In the vain of Company of Men meets Swimming with Sharks, i highly recommend this daring film!!",1101772800,3,378,4.626865671641791
2163085,1,B00062J02G,"First, congratulations to the marketing department for Rick.  Their description of the film was compelling enough to convince me and a friend to pluck this from the shelves of Video Americain in Takoma Park, MD over thousands of better choices.  Well done.  Second, I must implore you, the prospective viewer, to not make the same mistake.  This is not some deep analysis of the regrettable concessions made to make it in the cut-throat world of Corporate America.  Rather, it is a story of a bum-kissing Rick (Bill Pullman) who -- having humiliated Michelle (Sandra Oh) in an early interview and later getting her fired from her waitressing job -- supposedly gets his just desserts when (1) his much younger boss screws his daughter and (2) the assassin he hires to kill the boss accidentally kills the daughter instead.  Are we suppose to believe that this is the Curse of Michelle working?  (""I curse you. I curse you.  I curse you,"" says the character, so maybe the repetition means ""yes, this is significant."")  I am not revealing anything here that the movie doesn't telegraph about 1/4 into it, people.  Really! Bad overacting by all players except Oh, a horrific score, and a script that could be written by a high school student with aspirations to Make It Big. Do not see this film.  Anyone who would give this 5 stars is either working for the industry or desperate for something more than Lassie to show in their hometown.",1101772800,4,1434,4.765182186234818
2163086,1,B00062J02G,"This movie had potential in the beginning, and left me hoping that it would lead to a great revenge story after the cruel treatment of Michelle. Way too many things in the movie just happened with no explanation such as the appearance of ""Buck"" and Rick knowing his daughter's password for her cybersex chat email address. It seemed like there was a bunch of stuff thrown into the plot haphazardly in order to make the plot seem more twisted, yet unrealistic. The fact that his daughter turns into a [...] right before she dies, and Rick barely shows distraught when he walks away from it is disturbing in a very forced way. The emotion in this movie is so shallow, and the lack of lighting at all is unnecessary to portray the sick atmosphere.",1101168000,4,744,4.559701492537314
2163087,5,B00062J02G,"Not many people saw this movie, and I had to journey into the city of Manhattan to watch it. I was glad I did that, because I was treated to one of the best films of the year. ""Rick"" is the darkest movie that I have ever seen, and it's a shame that it wasn't distributed to more movie theatres. It stars Bill Pullman, as one of the most unlikeable characters ever created. Rick O'Lette is a mean, mean man, who treats everybody that is under him as if they are stupid. This movie takes place in Manhattan, and it takes place in the sneedy corparate world, where everybody is in it for the money, the fame, or the glory, and they will do a anything for get revenge or to get to the top. It's a drama that could work as a comedy, and there is only one character that we could root for, and hope that nothing happens to. Everybody else, until the end of course, you couldn't care less about, and it's nice to see a refreshing change of pace in movies. It's hard to guess if the mainstream audiences will like this movie, because it's like nothing that they've never seen before. The ending is grim and sadly unfortunate, and it's totally different than what I see in my theatres.

As I said already, Bill Pullman plays Rick O'Lette, but everybody calls him Rick, and not Mr. O' Lette, or ""sir"" or anything else. In this world, it seems that he is the only one that makes sense, sometimes, especially when the secretary of the building, Laura, is selling candy bars for his child's school, and they are all ten dollars a bar. He is the only one that seems to realize that it is incredibly stupid to buy one of them, and he is the only one that is not eating them all day. Also, in this world, others think that they know it all, especially when Rick interview, Michelle, comes into the building, and Laura give her the directions to go there, which involved going straight, making a left at the fax, a left at the coffee machine, a right at the printer, etc. Rick treats her horribly, and doesn't give her the job, something that comes back to haunt him. Later, him and his boss, who is much much younger than he is, go out for a drink, and it turns out that the waitress is Michelle. He gets her fired, and she puts a curse on him, stating that he is a horrible person, and he will pay for the way that he treats people. His boss, Duke, goes back to the office to ""work,"" when he is really have anoynomous internet sex with some girl over  the internet. His screen name is BIG BOSS. He doesn't know that he is doing it with Rick's high school daughter, Eve, who is not actually participating in the sexual act, but just amusing herself, and whoever it is that she is talking to. Eventually, Rick meets Buck, who kills big corparate imagines for money. Rick hires him to kill Duck, mostly after he finds out what he may or may not be doing with his daughter. He gives Buck the key to his storage space to dispose of the body, and when the night of the office Christmas party comes, also the night where the murder will take place, Rick could begin to have second thoughts. . .

I didn't expect the ending of ""Rick"" to be what it was, but it had me thinking about it for a while afterwards. The only character here that you care about is Eve, because you could relate to her, and also because she is the only nice one. She is the only person that Rick cares about, and after his wife died, he does everything that he can to make sure that she doesn't leave him too, but she is becoming distant. It's the only spark of emotion Rick's character has, and this movie plays with his emotions. He is changing as these things around him unfold, and by the ending, you either are glad about what happens, or very upset, depending on the way that you feel about Rick. I'm not going to reveal the ending, but I want to shroud it in mystery so you'll see it for yourself.

I love the wonderful dark. grim, feel of this Manhattan. It's so unlike the Manhattan that I am in often, and it brings such a dark look to these characters, and this other world. ""Rick"" makes it own universe in a world very much like our own, but we just don't see some of the things that happen are so stupid. ""Rick"" does exaggerate some of these stupid things, but makes it hilarious because nobody, except Rick, notices. I love this movie, and I want to buy the DVD, but am having problems finding it. I recommend  this, and am calling it one of the best films of the year.

ENJOY!

8037571,5,B00062J02G,"This movie re-imagines Verdi's great opera, Rigoletto, with the title character, Rick, as a corporate underling working for a disgusting young corporate mogul (a/k/a the Duke of Mantua).  When Rick casually destroys the career of a colleague, played by Sandra Oh (the brilliant choice to play Monterone!), he doesn't realize that her curse is the first step to the ultimate destruction of his life, and the death of his beloved daughter.  Even if you don't know Rigoletto, the film is a merciless, brilliant takedown of the soulessness of corporate culture -- but if you do know the opera, you will be blown away.",1448064000,,613,4.941747572815534

8037575,5,B00062J02G,I received this movie in a orderly fashion and I loved it! It was so much better than I thought it would be. I normally don't like office dramas but this one everything was great about it!,1381968000,,188,4.108108108108108
8037576,3,B00062J02G,"Based on the reviews I assumed this is a drama.  Turns out is is a strange comedy, though difficult to know how to take it.  Farcical seems to apply.  Largely juvenile also seems to apply.  The extras, especially the comments by writer and director, seem to lead one to believe that it is not only a serious effort, but also that it is a drama.  The divergence between the latter, and the fact that it is a comedy, underscores the strangeness and bafflement as to intent.

What is certain is that Sandra Oh is, as ever, a standout, though in a supporting role so not enough of her.  (For a wonderful, emotional performance by her, in a surprisingly excellent film, see ""Defendor,"" with an excellent performance in the lead by Woody Harrelson.)

Expecting a drama, perhaps a second viewing will result in a clearer idea as to what is intended by this film.",1336521600,,855,4.542483660130719

8037578,3,B00062J02G,"If the guys from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN had been even more cartoonishly evil and crass, they would be the characters in this movie. And the fact is, those very traits make some bits in this satire absolutely hilarious.

Both of the male leads in this film, Rick and Big Boss (who is half Rick's age), seem to compete for the designation of Bad Guy. Equally sleazy, both characters pull stunts that will literally make you gasp. The opening exchange between Bill Pullman and Sandra Oh may be the most politically incorrect scene in all of film. And it's classic.

No need for a scene-by-scene analysis here. Suffice it to say, there's intrigue, there's back-biting, double-dealing, and really a lot more than I expected when I purchased the DVD from the $1 box at my local store. This is a fun movie with a truly shocking surprise ending (which makes no sense once you think it through).

8037579,2,B00062J02G,"This film is pointless, for many reasons.  Not the least of which is that it's a bad bastardization of Victor Hugo's Le Roi s'Amuse (and Verdi's Rigoletto).

It gets off to an intriguing start, though.  Meet Rick (Bill Pullman) - the office jerk.  He's a fairly unlikable guy, but that's because his wife was killed.  Rick is also pushed around by his less-talented, half-his-age boss.  So an old schoolmate says for $10,000 he'll kill any one person of his choosing.  What do you do?

If you're Rick, you let yourself get pushed into something you don't want to do, and you make racial slurs on not one but two occasions to Sandra Oh, keep her from getting a new job and get her fired from her old one.  So it's kind of hard to root for old Rick.

This film seems to want to tell us something, some truth about the human condition, but what?

That all receptionists are mean?  That all bosses are evil?  That they always have clich&eacute;d, drunkard wives?  That you can never get over the loss of a loved one?  That grieving people are easily manipulated?  That it's okay to be racist against Asians?  That there are no good people, anywhere, ever?
