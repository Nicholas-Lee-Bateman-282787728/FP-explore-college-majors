If you have problems with a puppy or dog that bites or fights, it's high time you watched this DVD and learn WHY, and also how to correct the problem before it costs you money, prestige, honor and self-esteem. Milan has an incredible way with even the crankiest canines, and it is a joy to watch him tame the savage beasts and return them to the world of fun-loving household pet.",1321056000,2,519,4.531914893617022

I loved the way he explains why the dog has the aggression it has... Breaking the dog from that aggression Cesar is Great at... Too bad we do not have a couple of 1,000 Cesar's.....",1314489600,,401,4.36
