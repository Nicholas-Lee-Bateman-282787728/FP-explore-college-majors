8398040,2,B003JD5H62,"I'm a trailer geek and was hoping for something along the lines of the 42nd Street Forever collections.  In those collections, you can either watch the trailers as-is or check out the commentary.  But as mentioned in the other review, the commentary is not optional here.  Some of the comments are interesting and funny, but I dislike not having the choice of seeing the trailers by themselves.  I am glad they put the movie and cartoons on here, because I probably won't be revisiting the trailers very often.

Also can't stand the ""bumper"" at the end of every single trailer, it gets very repetitive and annoying if you're watching all of these in one go.  I had to keep reaching for the mute button.",1310342400,3,702,4.620967741935484
8398041,1,B003JD5H62,"I bought this hoping I could just watch the trailers and loop over my own music, but the interviews are mandatory and everything has a water mark. Horrible.",1285632000,7,156,4.607142857142857
