7979797,4,B000087F25,the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and won't let you fall asleep for a while.,1389225600,,100,3.590909090909091
7979798,1,B000087F25,"I write this review as a fan and collector of bad movies. I love bad horror. I did not pop this in expecting Smiles of a Summer Night, but this is one of the most pitiful things ever released straight-to-dvd (which is saying something).  There are thousands of cheeseball horror flicks to choose before you should even glance at this one.

Aside from the cardboard ""characters"", the nonexistent ""plot"", the numbing ""effects"", the wooden ""acting""... this movie doesn't even have the wit to STOOP to exploitation. Saddled with cardboard ""types,"" the performers aren't even allowed to portray their assigned stereotypes properly within the movie's baffling and idiotic events. The poor ""actors"" shuffle through this thing like wigged crash test dummies, but I have only pity for them. The story is a quilt of half-borrowed, completely forgettable cliches. Presumably writer/director Cotten was forced to make this disjointed, boring turkey under extreme duress and financial need.

And before anyone starts saying camp value or intentional parody, this steaming pile is about as funny and fascinating as a pedicure. More amazingly, the bonehead producers weren't smart enough to insist on any genuinely prurient sex or violence to leaven this leaden muck. It plays like an 80 minute afterschool special on Tourette's filmed by outpatients at a rehab center.

I wouldn't use this DVD as a coaster; I would be afraid to drink from the glass afterwards.",1213833600,,1447,5.197424892703863
7979799,1,B000087F25,"DEMON SLAYER is another one of those ridiculous let's put five teens together in a ridiculous situation, with ridiculous special effects, ridiculous editing, lighting, and acting not even on the level of pre-school plays.
Five juvenile delinquents (and also orphans) are told that if they spend three days cleaning up an abandoned hospital, they won't have to go to jail. [...]  Their supervisor is a former wrestler and the man behind the whole project is a lecherous priest.  (Are there any other kind in horror movies?).  Needless to say, we already know there's something amiss as in the opening scene, a building inspector is brutally murdered by a bunch of whore demons with glowing red eyes.
What's so brutally frustrating with this movie is that nothing happens in this flick until about twenty minutes till the end, and then it is so poorly done, it becomes howlingly uproarious.  Unless you really like your horror served up in a microwave, I wouldn't bother.",1107820800,,969,4.962962962962963
7979800,2,B000087F25,"This film is about five troubled teens who are assigned by a court to work in an old abandoned and possessed hospital. It's such a by-the-numbers re-worked plot that even as each of the kids are introduced to the camera a little caption appears under them, so you know who's the 'goth', who's the 'brother' etc... because the producers are assuming you're too stupid to tell - even with their stereotyped clothing on!
And possession? A young woman's dolls' eyes light up. Next she's a demon! Huh? She runs around trying to hack at people. But, hey, you have to wait until the last 20 mins for this to occur anyway.
There's a tiny bit of nudity.
Leave this lemon alone.",1057795200,7,668,4.528925619834711
