He's thinking bigger too, instead of one female jogger/hiker, he gets three!  lol  Lots more action in this one.  Anyone who says this one's boring, is around the bend and lives in the basement.  Vern obviously thinks he has taken some 'outgoing personality' course and is out to find him a 'WOMAN'.  He's even more deluded than ever now that he has experience.  ""I'm gonna cut you up like the ***** pig that you are!""  lol
  He asks probing questions of his three candidates to find his idea woman.  (Kind of like one of those TV Alaskan Bush boys.)  Vern: Have you ever been married?  Candidate:  Yes, whimper.  Vern:  Damaged goods!  with disgust.  lol
  You get see his father, Dan Haggerty, again!?  The kind and gentle mt man father almost steals the show with his common sense and caring and doing the right thing attitude.  It's a pleasure if you're a Grizzly Adams fan, to see Haggerty again in his element.  Jan M. Vincent plays a great ole too, with his spoiled rich guy attitude.  Will HE make it?  or will he have a run in with ole Vern.  Plenty of great scenery and hunting and guns and knives.  A top notch cult classic.",1486598400,,1223,4.45662100456621

8020285,5,B000227Q9O,This is my first movie of USA to watch.  I like it . . . very much.  Reminds me of me early days.  Makes me wish I was 10 years younger.,946166400,4,136,3.3225806451612905
