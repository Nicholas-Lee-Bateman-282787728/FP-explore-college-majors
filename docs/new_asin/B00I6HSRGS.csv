8639586,1,B00I6HSRGS,Very boring.  Nothing more than driving up a paved road - already past fall peak colors.  You do not see any overlooks - like shown on the cover. A missed opportunity.  Could have been filmed anywhere.,1516665600,,201,4.527777777777778

8639588,5,B00I6HSRGS,Beautiful scenery not found on other virtual bike videos. A road trip through the Blue Ridge Mountains! Continuous forward movement at a nice pace keeps you peddling down the road. Natural forest sounds with audible bird calls. Don't miss this one. You'll love it!,1428537600,,264,5.0227272727272725
