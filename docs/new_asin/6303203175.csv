7841039,1,6303203175,"The Japanese-inspired US series ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" was one of my primary objects of venom and spite during the 1990's.

For starters, it was too violent for kids. In Sweden, the series was originally dubbed to Swedish, but after severe criticism, the cable channel airing it had to switch to English with Swedish titles. Since the Swedish dubbing was incomprehensible anyway, this (ironically) made MMPR easier to watch!

But the primary reason why I hated MMPR was, of course, that it's so bad, it's not even a turkey.

The power rangers are starred by young adults. In this episode, these actors are forced to behave like stupid little kids, throwing food at each other in a gigantic food fight!

Worse is to come.

The evil alien witch Rita Repulsa (based on the Moon) wants to take over the world by creating a big, apocalyptic pig with supernatural powers. You heard me. A *pig* with supernatural powers. The pig looks like a large pig's head with a Roman (?) helmet and two feet. Undoubtedly the most ridiculous monster since...well, I don't know. Like ever?

Pudgy Pig attacks the Earth, and our heroes (fresh from the food fight) morph into the invincible ninjutsu heroes THE MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS!!! The inevitable karate fights ensue (this is what made parents all over the world upset), Rita makes Pudgy even bigger, and the Power Rangers have to use their ""dinozords"" to save the world and, presumably, our food supplies.

Did I mention that Pudgy is a pig, by the way?

As for the dinozords, they are large, dinosaur-like vehicles which are obviously toys made to look bigger on the TV screen. Did the special effect department have a lunch break? Ed Wood, come back, all is forgiven!

I no longer remember how the episode ends, except that the pighead suddenly explodes. The power rangers are free to take on the next threat: the Chunky Chicken monster. Stay tuned for the next episode.

One star is the only option for this one. Unless you have a humour that would make even *my* head spin, LOL.",1268611200,,2030,4.7578347578347575
