8253053,3,B0013UQUW8,"I once saw all of these movies and found them romantic at that time but basically they are old and now outdated and somewhat cheesy as far as how the romance part of the movies in particular are filmed. In order of best to least I would put The Awakening 1st but close with Broken Lullaby, and Loving Evangeline last. I would pass these over easily for some that don't even have sex (no nudity shown in these except back,shoulders,and legs) in them.",1315180800,,449,4.421686746987952
8253054,4,B0013UQUW8,"All three movies are great.  You can preview them when they come on Lifetime, but I wanted to add them to my home library.  The movies are as good as the Harlequin books.  Very romantic and fun.  They are often fairly predictable, but still very enjoyable.  Here's what the back says.  May help you decide if you want to make the purchase:

""The Awakening""
A levelheaded young woman is thrown off balance when she teams up with a bounty hunter to track an antiques smuggler.  Her adventure leads her to discover a passion within her.

""Broken Lullaby""
Attempting to solve a family mystery, Jordan meets Nick, who is searching for the same music box that is her only clue.  But someone else is searching for the priceless antique.

""Loving Evangeline""
A powerful executive returns to his seaside hometown following his brother's fatal boating accident.  He finds himself becoming obsessed with the truth about his brother's death as well as the attractive marina owner.",1239408000,,968,4.871165644171779
8253055,3,B0013UQUW8,"I saw Loving Evangeline on WTN, and wanted a copy for myself.  When I found out that the price of that movie alone was the same as the triple feature, I figure I had nothing to lose.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for The Awakening (I found it offensive, actually), and Broken Lullaby (boring). Luckily, Loving Evangleine was just a good as I remembered.  It has an excellent mystery (the identity of the bad guy came as quite a surprise), and Nick Mancuso made me cry not once, but twice, talking about his murdered younger brother.  It is a movie I'll be watching again often.",1217635200,,576,4.40566037735849
8253056,4,B0013UQUW8,"If you enjoy the ""old"" Harlequin romances you will enjoy the movies. The Awakening, Broken Lullaby and Loving Evangeline have all have been tv movies on the Hallmark Channel. All three movies are mystery romances with good endings. Great watch on a cold rainy or snowy day. Buying them in the set is a really good buy.",1217289600,,318,4.5964912280701755
