989174,5,6305210101,"Smoke Signals was easily one of the best films of the year, and a must see for basically everyone. The road buddies in the film exude natural charm at every moment, and the story shines for both its depth of emotion and  resonance with the experiences of any marginal people living in North  America.  Now, only to find that Frybread Power T-shirt...
A definite  plus: no sex, little violence, no heavy cursing - a refreshing break from  Hollywood...",914716800,3,450,4.717948717948718
989175,5,6305210101,"""Smoke Signals"" is not just a movie about indian life.  It's a movie about relationships.  Between friends, between fathers and sons, between sons and mothers.  Go see it.  I haven't seen a movie this good in  years!",912470400,,216,4.72972972972973
989176,5,6305210101,"Smoke Signals shows Indian humor at its best. This film is just a small example of the everyday instances of growing up on a reservation without work and it really brings out the loyalty between the younger generation  and their elders. Even though Smoke Signals will have you rolling with  laughter, there is a strong message about love, honor, and life that is  portrayed here.  I recommend that everyone see this movie.",911865600,2,422,4.819444444444445

Art for sure, a beautifully filmed story, great acting on all counts, wonderful direction, and characters who stay with you long after the closing credits.

The ending is just a bit TOO tidy, but no real complaints.",1514851200,,395,4.6571428571428575

989348,5,6305210101,"This is among my top 10 favorite movies. I've owned a VHS copy of it for many years and just recently purchased the DVD. I do not know how many times I've watched and am always on the look-out for other similar Native American produced films. I am non-native but feel I understand a good deal of what is going on in the film - I've been trying to learn as much as possible about NA's since I was a child and later took several NA studies classes at University (thankfully with NA professors), have read innumerable books, worked with several NAs as an Archaeology Tech, and took care of a few sick and injured as a nurse.

IMO there are many things any viewer can take away from this film. Though there are elements specific to the NA experience in America and their culture(s), we all share a common humanity that is relatable to us all. Those of Euro-American extraction might feel a few stings of reality from the frequent ribs, which we should. As a few other reviewers mentioned, the description on the case labeling the movie a ""comedy"" is completely silly. It has several very funny moments but these are also mixed with a lot of pain, heartache and inner struggles. Many of us have had similar problems coming to terms with how we feel about our fathers and how/if we could forgive them; many have experienced similar periods of love and loss, alcoholism, family discord, etc.",1508025600,,1384,4.536

989464,5,6305210101,"Oh, how I loved this film. It is more than a good buddy film or an on the road film. This is a getting to know you, my father and my family film.

As the film begins in Idaho, on an Indian Reservation, it is the Fourth of July, 1976. This is the day, baby Thomas Builds-the-Fire, is saved by being thrown from an upper window when his house burns down in the middle of the night. He is caught by Arnold Joseph, played by Gary Farmer, a drunk neighbor who is eventually thrown out by his wife, Tantoo Cardinal. He leaves his son, Victor Joseph, played by Adam Beach, who is the love of Arnold's life. Off he goes to live in Phoenix.

When Victor becomes a young man, his mother is notified that Arnold has died, and someone should come and pick up his things. Mom only had $40, but Thomas, the know it all and talks all the time, has money, and he offers it to Victor, if Thomas can accompany him on the adventure. Off They Go, and what an adventure they behold. The native Americans are still not looked at as they should be, but these two behave on the way to Phoenix. In Phoenix they meet Arnold's friend, a lovely young woman.  Victor filled with righteous anger and Thomas a free spirit find the world.

This was such a well developed film, superb acting, wonderful writing and directing, a joy to watch. Not maudlin nor sad, but filled with some very humorous scenes. Two young men with not much in common, find themselves, and give us an excelkent film.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-06-17",1496707200,7,1497,4.351254480286738

It's a wonderful story about how 2 young boys, forever linked together by tragedy & growing up differently - one a storyteller & the other a cynic, find common ground as they take a road trip to bury the cynics father, who abandoned the family a long time before. It may move slowly for some, but I found it both humorous & inspiring",1483574400,7,553,4.111111111111111

I thought they could have done a better job with the scene of the accident.  The intensity between Victor and the husband seemed forced.  And I hope that was a wig after Victor chopped his hair cause it was fake looking and ugly.  Other than that, I love this movie!

990068,5,6305210101,"I highly recommend this movie as a way to get a better understanding of what real Indians are like. (I lived for a time in Indian Country), seeing as how the main characters are native and live on a reservation. Yet the story isn't condescending, it just shows the setting of reservation living more realistically than some people might realize. ""Dances with Wolves"" it ain't!.

 It is also a great story depicting the difficulty and struggles to find themselves that young men who are raised without a dad (or without a reliable dad) may go though. I raised my son alone and could really relate to the two main characters... one whose parents died when he was a baby and the other who had a dad who was very disappointing. Young men raised that way always have things they need to reconcile about their relationship with their fathers, or they may never find themselves and move on to a better place in their lives.",1474588800,6,916,4.579268292682927

This movie highlighted the problems of poverty and alcoholism that the students were learning about through the novel.  I considered this a good addition to my lesson plans because this movie was directed by a Native American and had a huge Native American cast.  It portrayed Native Americans realistically versus stereotypically.,1450137600,,464,5.22972972972973

If you are, or know of, any menfolk in particular that have come to that step in life when they are able to admit weakness, and the inability to change everything we think we'd like to then this movie will certainly bring  plenty of cleansing tears, like the power of a river and salmon! Therapeutic, healing and funny. If you were born in the 60's you will especially love it.  Acting was superbly. Best viewed with good speaker system since the drums are integral to the mood. Succinct with hints throughout that remind us of the special magic and wit in Native American culture.

Among the very few coming-of-age films told from the perspective of a different culture, Smoke Signals delivers the story of Victor and Thomas, two Native Americans traveling cross country to obtain the ashes of a man they both identified with as father. Along the way, they realize they knew two completely different men, and are forced to reconcile their two different images of a complex father figure while struggling with what it means to be a modern Native American.

The film pokes fun at a variety of Native American stereotypes, but also introduces serious topics relating to reservation life, such as domestic abuse and alcoholism. Far wiser than many will expect, Smoke Signals challenges us to forgive those that perhaps do not deserve it, that one must let their hatred go before it consumes them. Smoke Signals will always be special because of the genre it is working in, as it is one of the few Native American teen films. For that reason it is especially important, for it contains a perspective that all should see. Yet Smoke Signals also touches on several universal questions about growing up and understanding the people around us, ultimately telling a story that transcends generational and racial boundaries so that everyone can relate to it.",1429228800,,1386,5.026086956521739

991229,4,6305210101,"As another reviewer noted, the overwhelming majority of reviews are overwhelmingly positive.  I want to make clear that my comments are as a) a non-native American who b) never lived or worked on a reservation, and c) Didn't read any of the books.
In other words, maybe it's a decent review for white people by a white person?
I've forgotten now why I got the movie (probably a positive review somewhere!).  It is now available on DVD, which seems to have prompted some renewed interest in it.

All the principal characters are native Americans who live on a reservation [Canadians are the principal actors it seems].  The story, for me, started slowly--VERY SLOWLY.  And it took a long time to pick up the pace.  In fact, the pace almost never did pick up until very near the end, when some longstanding problems are finally resolved: between the living  and the departed, and between the living and the living.

Victor's family died in a fire when he was just a baby.  His mother (I think) tossed him out of an upstairs window hoping to at least save his life.  And Thomas's dad caught him, which seemed at the time to be the one heroic act in his whole life.

The movie shows, without dwelling too much on it, some of the issues on reservations: alcoholism for example.  Thomas's dad is an alcoholic and one day, he leaves and never comes back.  Thomas seems to love his dad but hate what drinking does to him, and when his mother gives his dad an ultimatum about quitting, the dad just leaves.  But there's a lot more to the dad than one sees at first glance.  He seems a deeply philosophical man, prone to utter semi-enigmatic statements....

Victor grows up looking excessively nerdy.  His heavy black glases and combed-back hair make him, to me, look like the native-American equivalent of earlier black singers (and others) who tried to look more ""white"" to make it in broader society--and yet Victor doesn't seem to be trying to GET anywhere--he's just living on the res.  He's just a nerdy, non-athletic and rather intelligent kid would be one way to view it.  Another issue: lack of many jobs, and a relative lack of need for money [whether it may be distributed casino profits, subsidies, simple lifestyles or whatever other reasons, when Victor offers Thomas his stash of money, he briefly makes the comment how it really isn't needed on the reservation anyhow, downplaying the generosity of his offer that Thomas finds initially hard to accept.

Thomas is bigger and heavier than Victor...I wasn't clear if he was older and if so, by how much, but he's better-looking and he seems quite comfortable with really looking like he belongs on the reservation.

The film depicts Victor constantly seeking Thomas's approval and Thomas pretty much always withholding it.  Perhaps in part it's because Victor had lost most of his own family as a baby, perhaps it's gratitude for Thomas's dad saving his life spilling over to Thomas the son, perhaps it's just wanting to hang out with a ""cool"" guy--whatever.  On Thomas's part, I wondered if he resented Victor on some level, as having been saved by his own father who then later abandoned him-a sort of jealousy, maybe.  Their relationship is stuck at this level until Thomas suddenly gets the news: his father died, and the woman who is calling from one state over suggests he come collect his dad's things.  Thomas has no money for such a trip, which is where Victor's offer of money comes in, and a long road trip by the 2 of them back and forth ensues.

Along the way, the tension Thomas had usually shown around Victor starts to ease, and the two of them make various sort of insider-jokes and comments about Indians the way the white man sees them...

When they arrive, they meet this Asian-looking woman, who had to have been considerably younger than Thomas's dad (but also clearly, older than Thomas).  It's apparent she and his dad were living together, and as she starts telling Thomas things about his dad that he didn't know, first all of his pent-up anger at abandonment surfaces, eventually followed by a new appreciation for his father (which, in complicated ways that are hard to put into words, is followed by more acceptance of himself, and lastly by real friendship with Victor.  And yes, the closing monolog (spoken by an unseen narrator) about the nature of forgiveness, I think makes the whole film worth watching--whatever your identity is.  Lastly: the slowness might also be seen as a reflection of the slower pace of life on a reservation (and in many other societies too), compared to what it's like living in a Western city.  I'm not making any value judgment here, just an observation--I've seen a few places where the overall bustle and energy-level seemed to exceed what I'd seen in major American cities, too.  The pace differs in different locations.

I hope this doesn't seem like too much of a spoiler review for someone who hasn't seen the film--let me assure you, this is only a sketch of what it's about; there's plenty that I did not cover.",1417564800,,5035,4.724256292906179

991369,3,6305210101,"Smoke Signals is a Movie about 2 main characters, Thomas and Victor and how they learn to realize their heritage and how Victor learns to forgive his father and find out who he really is. The beginning of the movie starts off with showing Victor and Thomas as teens, and flashbacks to when they were kids on the reservation. Then when Victor finds out that his father dies, he and Thomas go out on a journey to get his fathers stuff. During the journey, Victor realizes that he is still holding on to the anger to his father, and learns to forgive his father, and apologize to everyone else.
During the beginning we find out that Thomas parents died when he was very young, and he grew up with his grandmother. Victors parents on the other hand where alcoholics and his dad left him when he was 12 years old. It shows how it wasn't easy growing up as an Indian, especially on the reservation. Then when Victor finds out his dad dies, he and Thomas (because Thomas helped pay for them to travel) go on a journey to recover his dads possessions, but during the journey, victor goes through an emotional rollercoaster, learning about who he is, and how to forgive.
During the journey, Victor starts out very mean and stingy, still holding on to the anger. As he continues traveling, he gets told by Thomas and Suzy (a friend to his dad) to forgive his dad and learn to move on. He finally forgives him when he gets in a car accident and realizes how his anger has been hurting everyone else. He apologies to his friends and family in the end, and accepts his heritage and his past life isn't going to change, but that he just needs to keep on moving forward.
Overall, I would rate this movie a 7/10. It had good acting, and a good message, but just a hard to follow plot and some parts that seemed irrelevant to the story.

991370,3,6305210101,"Smoke Signals is a movie about a Native American boy named Victor trying to make peace between him and his deceased father, Arnold. It starts by showing how a fire at a New Year's Eve party killed the family of a boy named Thomas, Victor's friend, and shows the reason Why Thomas lives with his grandmother and why Arnold was troubled to the point of cutting his hair, becoming an alcoholic, abusing his wife and son, Victor, and ultimately leaving them and the Native American reservation where they all lived. After Victor's mother receives a phone call from Arnold's new lover about his death his mother grieves and Victor's hopes of his father coming back one day were crushed. Victor intended to go to Arizona where his father died to get his ashes but with only $40 could not afford the trip to Arizona from the reservation they lived in located in Idaho. Thomas, the boy saved by Arnold in the New Year's party, is Victor's childhood friend and seems to his some form of mental disability, most likely due hitting his head on the ground when Arnold caught him after he was thrown out the window in hopes of being saved. He lives with his grandmother and loves telling stories whether they are fact or fiction. Thomas decides to give Victor his savings to make the trip to Arizona but his only condition is to take him with him. Victor eventually and reluctantly agrees to let Thomas accompany him and they leave together to find where Victor's father lies and experience the world outside the reservation. Smoke Signals does a good job in portraying what life is really like in the Native American reservations and contrasting it with that of the outside world and shows examples of discrimination against Native Americans outside of the reservations. The movie also shows how the bond between a father and son is unbreakable, no matter how damaged.",1413331200,,1856,4.731481481481482

991453,5,6305210101,"A narration by Thomas Builds the Fire opens this movie and introduces us to Victor, his best friend, and relates in flashback what is known about the fire that killed Thomas's parents and led to Victor's father, Arnold, being called a hero for his rescue of the infant Thomas. But now Arnold has been gone for several years, leaving his son bitter and angry with his alcoholic father's abandonment, with life in general, and with Thomas specifically. When Victor's mother receives word that her absent husband has died in Arizona, Victor is forced to rely on Thomas's offer to finance the trip to retrieve his father's ashes on the condition that Thomas goes along for the adventure. The two young men have nothing in common; Victor berates Thomas for his lack of ""Indian-ness,"" leading to many comic moments on the journey. Thomas gently needles Victor while making small attempts to humor him. Victor's shell begins to crack when he arrives at his father's trailer home and meets the neighbor, played by Irene Bedard, who pointedly suggests that perhaps Arnold does not entirely deserve all the scorn carried by his son. This film is an all-Native American production and you may have seen the actors in other films. Adam Beach is perhaps most recognizable from his recurring role on Law & Order. Despite the comedy, this is a film rich in observation and one that you won't soon forget.

I have once imagined what if his father told everything about the fire accident to his family member. I think they could have lived happier with all family members. On the other side, I also think that Victor is a lucky guy because he has a best friend like Thomas who had been always beside him. It was really sweat movie.",1396051200,,629,4.384615384615385

There is some very hard stuff in this movie but it stops short of being traumatic to the viewer; rendered not only palatable but redemptive through an expert production and excellent acting.  There isn't a weak link in the entire movie.  The sound track knocks the thing into the stratosphere  --  the film so reliant on Ulali's dramatic chant that it is like one of the major characters.  The scene near the end where the mother raises the ashes is unforgettable.

I thought that Victor was a little more mean in the movie than in the book, and a little too harsh on Thomas. Even though Thomas can be a little weird and annoying with his stories, I think Victor wouldn't know a lot of things without Thomas.

They explained the history of Native Americans without shoving in your face, or down your throat. It made me think more on what native Americans had to, and still have to go through. This movie was a great example of awesome story writing, humor, and craftsmanship. You can tell that Sherman Alexie really knew how to capture the viewer, and still show a great amount of history. The only reason why I took off a star was because of some of the actors. A few, and I mean very few, were not fit for their roles. Even going off onto some of the side people, there were some people that just didn't work. If you get past that fact, which is very small, then you will have the same reaction to the movie as I did.

There was a lot of angst portrayed in the beginning but the trip made by Victor and Thomas forged a great connection between the two.  Victor was able to resolve his longstanding bitterness toward his father and his world.  Thomas' admiration for Victor was his way of not being so alone.  The movie starts with Thomas saying, ""At a young age, I knew I could fly.""  At the end he was more confident of his ability to live his own life but he has a good friend in Victor.  Particular touches made me laugh out loud like the car that only goes in reverse and a ""49"" dance song about George Washington and his teeth while the guys were on the bus.

It is funny and it is sad but the sad plight of the American Indians who live in settlements and reservations still are not exaggerated simply presented as issues that need to be addressed realisticly.

992304,4,6305210101,"I watched this film for an Ethnic American Literature class and didn't know what to expect.  Some reviews led me to think it was an indie comedy, with a road trip thrown in (isn't that the indie way?).  I didn't find much to laugh at in this film; I watched it on a bleak, rainy Saturday afternoon and felt even bleaker afterwards.

We talked about stereotypes in class and this film does nothing to contradict those stereotypes.  Alcoholism, hopelessness, and despair are the order of the day, as we watch Victor's father hit him, set a house on fire (because he was drunk), kill two people, and ultimately desert his family because he can't promise Victor's mother that he'll stop drinking.  He leaves their impoverished reservation only to end up on another one, and meets an attractive young woman with some not-so-savory secrets in her own past.  She is a sympathetic character, however, and they become friends; it is she who calls Victor's mother with the news that her husband has died.  Victor and his childhood friend (a lopsided friendship, to be sure, because it all comes from Thomas' side) Thomas decide to go retrieve Victor's father's ashes.  Thomas, of course, provides the money for this trip, and endures Victor's insults and criticism for the duration of the trip.

Victor can't forgive his father, of course, and carries almost equal amounts of rage and love churning up within him.  Thomas, who is a quirky, saintlike character, finally tells him off and tells him what to do to find some peace.  In the meantime, events occur which make you wonder if Victor will ever get a break.

The ending is ambiguous and left me wondering if Victor was finally going to be able to put his past to rest and get on with his life, or if he would ultimately end up just like his father.

992309,5,6305210101,"Smoke Signals is about two young Native American men that get an urge to travel to Phoenix.  Now, these two are drastically different both appearance and personality-wise.  The taller more mature one is the handsome and knowledgeable guy, while the other is a geeky talkative kid that smiles a lot and likes to have fun.  The mature one has to frequently remind the other that he's not going to be taken seriously by the white population acting the way he does and he better change the way he conducts himself, and fast.

Now I'm not sure if certain white people really are indifferent towards Native Americans up in the northwest Idaho territory in this day and age (or in 1998 when this movie was released) but the good news is that the story being told here is innocent and much friendlier than I went in expecting.  The violence is kept between the two men and never escalates into the white people coming into the picture and having a problem with them or anything of that nature.  This captures what I always believed the way Native Americans are like (proud of their roots and normally extra polite and spiritual) however I could be wrong since I don't know any of them personally- just the culture I see on TV programs and movies.

Anyway, there's more to this storyline than simply two guys travelling to Phoenix together on a bus.  We also see flashbacks throughout the movie concerning both of these men when they were just kids and how the father of the mature Native American was an alcoholic that had a regrettably lousy relationship with his son and wife resulting in the father just up and leaving one day.  From what I could tell, the two Native American men unintentionally happen upon the girlfriend (or friend) of the father that could reveal what the father was *really* like.  I wasn't quite sure if the two finding this woman's trailer out in the desert was an intentional visit or just chance.

The best part of the film comes during the final 20 minutes.  This is when the movie finally reaches a solid 5 stars for me.  Fantastic acting and presentation with a solid story around it makes this movie a winner.",1359676800,,2134,4.598944591029023

By the time I realized I had ordered a substandard version of this movie, I had already opened it, and Amazon will not let you return DVDs that have been opened. The Low Quality version I received was put out by (Echo Bridge Home Entertainment) and is usually sells for a bout five bucks or so.

The movie is not BAD its just about average.  It doesn't really stand out in any way and will probably mostly be of interest to other native americans.  There is some quirky and clever humor but any at least coming of age story should have something like that in there.  I didn't find it exceptionally endearing.  Unlike other native-centric cinema like Windwalker, or Dreamkeeper, there are not layers of subtle humor that 'insiders' (those raised in or deeply involved in native culture, like red road people) will pick up that normal watchers won't get.  It's just what you see is what you get.

992552,5,6305210101,"""Smoke Signals"" is based on the collection of stories by Sherman Alexie ""Lone-Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"". The structure of the film owns it to the story ""What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona"" but a lot of other ideas and episodes come from different stories in the same collection.

At heart, this is a father-to-son story, but with many culturally meaningful implications. There is a very strong Native American feeling to everything in the story.
I actually liked the beginning of the film, happening in the reservation, the best. To me, here it was the strongest of Alexie's outlook on life and way to interpret reality, his so very personal way to turn reality into something surreal and for this more poignant. I do like a lot the rest of the film as well, but this first part is, in my opinion, the more personal and original.
I enjoyed the ride on the bus a lot. That's probably the funniest part, with jokes, but also metaphors, all over the place.
The last part is maybe the less original. I mean, for a big part it falls into the kind of father-to-son story that I've seen before. A son trying to make sense of his father's life, trying to pin down how he's different from his father and how he's the same as his father and what part of this is good and what part is bad.
Here's where the journey of the main character, Victor, really lies. Here is where he changes his view of life in the end.

I did enjoy the film, but because I also read the story I couldn't help but make comparisons, and in a way I like the story best. While the film is definitely about Victor and his relation (I should say, changing relation) with his death father, the story is more about Victor and his relation with himself, as a man, but also (maybe even especially) as an American Indian. The different role played by Thomas Build-the-Fire inside the story tells it all. While in the film Thomas is Victor's travelling companion, the one who knew Victor's father and thought of him better than Victor ever did, in the story Thomas is the keeper of memory, he's the one who unearths forgotten memories and can make sense of them. In the film he's not the one who can make Victor see the truth. This role is Suzie's, who knew Victor's father in a different way from anyone else.
It's a very subtle difference, but still one that changes the core and the balance of the story.

All the actors are amazing, they just bring you into the story, but I especially loved Evan Adams. He has that same quality, which is also Alexie's, to turn reality into surreality and back, and delivered it to you in a richer way. I'm so sorry his character (Thomas) was scaled down from the story to the film, because he's certainly perfect for Thomas. The one who can see through reality, who can see beyond reality.

An important task brings the two men together on a road trip to confront the long shadow of Victor's father and his profound affect on the life of Thomas.

992710,5,6305210101,"I have now seen this film several times. The reason I saw it again just recently, is because I purchased it for my grandchildren. It seems every time I see it, I see something else in it. Now this is quite different for a Native audience than for a dominant culture audience. There are always those things we keep to ourselves, which is true for any culture, and of course it is very difficult to impossible. for someone from the dominant culture to walk in the moccasins of a Native.
  For example, in the reviews of the film on the back of the container, the critics comment on it as a comedy. I didn't see comedy in it. Of course there were those times where we saw samples of Indian humor, but other than that I didn't really see it as a comedy. Now those reviews were all done by European-Americans. I have always seen many levels of meaning in this film. There is the cultural stuff which is quite educational by itself. There is also the Spiritual stuff, especially from that wonderful character Thomas, who tells wonderful stories. He tells contemporary stories in a traditional way. Then there is the story itself. The father of Victor who is quite tragic, and the tortuous ambivalence Victor has toward him. There is a young man (Victor) lost from his culture, and who is brought back through a series of stories and events by Thomas. In other words, it covers culture, alcoholism, Reservation life, Spirituality, tragedy, humor, etc.
  Of course there is the wonderful ending when Thomas's grandmother asks him,""Tell me what happened Thomas. Tell what what is going to happen, Thomas."" Thomas's role here is very clear. He is a story teller, but a very gifted and very Spiritual and wise story teller. Some might say he has a gift for the Medicine Way.

992713,5,6305210101,"For a long time, Pow Wow Highway was my favorite Rez film, but Smoke Signals might squeeze that worthy effort into 2nd place. I don't really care for ""Dances With Wolves."" I see it as a film to make white people feel better about what was done to Indians in the past. I was also disappointed in ""Windtalkers."" I thought it would be about the men who fooled the Japanese by sending messages in Navajo, but no, it was about Nicholas Cage's nice white man, friend to the Windtalkers. I sure wish the movie had been an all-Indian production like Smoke Signals. Would have been a far better film.

I read a lot of the Amazon reviews so as not to tread ground previously trod upon. I went first to the negative reviews, few in number, though they be. We each have our own tastes. This isn't a CGI film, not a lot of stunts, special effects, or car chases. Most of the action occurs in the heart. At least two of the reviewers say the acting is really bad. Where do they get that? I'm white, but grew up near reservations in Montana, have a variety of Indian friends (and as a kid, a few enemies), and have cousins from two tribes. I won't claim to be an expert. You really have to live in someone else's skin to truly understand what it's like, or walk a mile in their moccasins. I thought the acting was first rate. The conversations sounded like ones I've heard over dinner tables, around campfires, and in taverns. One reviewer said the actors spoke with Canadian accents. That's pretty funny, though the main characters happen to be Canadian. Sounded a lot like some Indians I know. Maybe Canadians speak with Indian accents? I've been with Indian friends who spoke better English than the local whites, but loved to do a little ""indian-speak"" in the presence of bleeding heart whites, or their racist kin, just to see them cringe, or put them off. I'm not a ""cuzz-in,"" I'm a ""cuss'n.""

Anyway, the most unusual character in the film is Thomas. At first I wondered if Evan Adams was just a bad actor, or if his character was simple-minded. As the movie developed, his character unfolded. Thomas was part shaman, spirit guide, and in an odd way, a mentor. He is an innocent savant, naive, but not naive. His character is a device the writer chose to get some ideas across. I've known a lot of Victor types. They abound on the rez for good reason. Thomases are out there too, but they're not as obvious as the character in this movie.

Back in the Clinton era, there was a big political correctness effort in government service. Federal employees were supposed to refer to Indians as Native Americans. I decided to exercise my new found sensitivity at a family reunion, and in a discussion with my cousins, I used the term Native American. The indians started laughing. When I asked why, they said, ""You can sure tell a government worker!"" When I asked them what they called themselves (this may sound odd, but I'd always just thought of them as people), and they said, ""'Indians,' Columbus screwed us up, but we've decided it's easier to just go with it, and it's one word, not a bunch of them,"" and laughed their rear-ends off. It was pretty funny, but you'd have to have been there. Years later, a young Indian friend came to visit during a college semester break. After high school, he spent 4 years in the US Army and had been in the Desert Storm invasion of Iraq. He was able to attend (and graduate) from college on the GI Bill, and was taking an elective in anthropology. He told me about how the professor kept referring to Indians as ""indigenous people."" That really got to my young friend. He asked me if I'd been born in Montana, and I said yes. He then asked, ""Doesn't that make you indigenous to Montana? Doesn't that mean everyone who's born in a place is indigenous to it?"" Well, yes, it does. He told that to the professor, and got no response, just an angry shake of the head. Many of my Indian friends and relatives have passed away, and I haven't been around reservation culture for quite a long time, though I only live a few miles away. The word ""indigenous"" was used in the movie several times, so now I'm curious about it. Who is indigenous? The term must have hit the rez during the 1990s, because I don't recall it being used in earlier decades. Yep, I'm out of touch.

The song on the bus about John Wayne's teeth was hilarious. I won't be able to watch another John Wayne flick without looking at his teeth and hearing this song. The warrior face is something everyone who is ""different"" understands. It is a mask, protective gear. If you don't understand this, you're very white and have led a privileged life. It was pretty well explained in the movie, for us palefaces and maybe Indian boys who never thought about it, who are just conditioned to react. I once supervised a young, white, local boy on a large forest fire. He put on quite a macho swagger, always looked grim, had on the warrior face. Late one night we had a conversation about where our people came from. I explained that my family came from Scotland and Ireland. He gave me that puzzled look and asked, ""Are you really Irish? You don't seem Irish."" I asked what he meant. He said, ""Well I thought the Irish were tough. You don't act tough."" I told him the operative word was ""act."" Tough is being who you are, and not caring what anyone else thinks. I don't have a warrior face, and I don't put one on. I don't have to. I know who I am, and in deference to Victor, it's easier for me to blend in and not need one. A warrior face can keep your friends at bay, as well as your enemies. Yes, America is a foreign country to many Indians. It's hard to leave the reservation, no matter how talented you are, or how great your potential is. The Rez is where your friends and family are, where you're generally accepted for who you are. You're known there and don't have to explain yourself. No one stares at you. Leave the reservation and you're in a foreign land, even though you've seen it on TV, and come in contact with it through school sports and shopping trips. Living in this foreign land is not easy. Who do you go to when you're in trouble? Who do you talk to? Who understands? Who supports you? Who has your back? No one. It's a great problem that some universities are working to overcome, where Indian students are concerned. Most of white society is indifferent to the difficulty Indians have transitioning between the Rez and the outside world, and going to and from.

There are some really delightful cameo appearances in the movie, including Cynthia Gearing as Cathy, the alternate Olympic gymnast, and Elaine Miles as Lucy, the contrarian, who drives backwards. No, palefaces, reverse isn't the only gear left in her ""pony."" It's sweet and funny. Contrarians puncture pretension, disrupt authority, and inject humor. Both of these wonderful ladies had major roles in the TV series, Northern Exposure. Elaine was Dr. Fleishman's acerbic and insightful receptionist, Marilyn. Tom Skerritt nicely plays an almost stereotypical Arizona sheriff, who stereotypes Indians. However, the movie didn't devolve into an additional stereotype, man's inhumanity to man, as I dreaded it would. Life is a mixed bag. Sometimes honesty (a white witness) prevails, and authority accepts it. Gary Farmer (of Pow Wow Highway fame), is one of my favorite, unsung actors. He played the alcoholic, conflicted father to a ""T"". Alcoholism in Montana is rampant, not only on reservations, but in white society too. I think we have the 4th highest DUI and death rate due to alcohol in the US. I speak with some authority, having been sober now for 10 years. I was always perplexed to hear white drunks in local taverns talk disparagingly about drunken Indians, like, go look in a mirror! Indians aren't the only ones who are conflicted over alcoholic fathers. Some critics didn't care for the dumping of the ashes near Spokane Falls at the end of the movie, but to my mind,  it was necessary. If you thought the ashes and song about fathers was over the top, the film isn't speaking to you. Sons sometimes never come to grips with love for fathers who vacillate between smothering and totally absent (if not overtly abusive), and don't analyze their feelings and experiences, only process emotionally. It's possible that this ending may have reached some sons who never thought about it, couldn't put this into words.

If you like this film, or are encouraged to understand more about contemporary Indian life, I suggest reading McNichol's book, ""The Surrounded,"" and James Welch's works, ""Winter In The Blood,"" and ""The Death of Jim Loney."" The settings are in the 20th century, but will give you a gut level idea why some things are the way they are.",1277856000,4,8730,4.588725176169122

Since many more reviewers have stated their cases far more eloquently than I could, let me just say this: I think this is a charming, quirky, well-acted, thought-provoking movie.  Its slow pace perfectly reflects the feel of life; it's not a shoot-'em-up, mind-numbing exercise in ""entertainment,"" but a thoughtful study, a singular piece of art, a reflection of life. Perhaps, because it's texture and pacing are different, it seems quite unique and unsettling.

As Shakespeare says, acting (and by extension its venues, plays and movies) has a purpose: ""to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.""

992804,3,6305210101,"This film is to be commended for giving viewers a look at the culture and experience of native American people, without the usual Hollywood sentimentalization and stereotyping.  The plot is passable, it's a archetypal father-son wounding-conflict-forgiveness story that would be great to show at a Mankind Project Integration-Group gathering.  Even though this is a small-budget indie movie that was much celebrated at Sundance, it still has its share of storytelling cliches.

The fatal flaw is that Adam Beach, who plays the main protagonist, is mediocre at best---his acting is as flat as the poor camera work and flaccid film editing.  He is hopelessly not up to the material, especially in the scenes where he's supposed to be breaking out of his stoic persona and having some emotional outbursts.  Evan Adams plays opposite him as the ""wise fool"" sidekick who speaks English with a weird Irish-sounding accent that is supposed to pass for native American, he might have been more engaging with a better director behind the camera.  Gary Farmer phones in his role as the lumbering, rough-but-really-not-that-bad-a-guy alcoholic father.

The film finally lights up when the drop-dead gorgeous Irene Bedard comes onscreen, but unfortunately her character is never developed at all---the film quickly shifts back into male-bonding road-movie mode.  Tantoo Cardinal and Monique Mojica are the two other more talented cast members but like Bedard, are given far too little screen time.

Overall, I felt like I was watching a 1970s era made-for-TV production, perhaps an ""Afterschool Special"" or Disney movie.  There is zero narrative tension or momentum, it just kind of slackly meanders along.  It's a shame because had this film been put in the hands of a capable director and film editor, it would gain a far wider audience.",1248652800,2,1827,5.243986254295533

992884,4,6305210101,"The movie, ""Smoke Signals"", is about a Native American man living on the Coeur d'Alene reservation who finds out that his father, who left him and his mother ten years prior, just died. The main character, Victor, must go to Arizona to gather the remains and any of his father's belongings. Accompanying him is Thomas, a life-long acquaintance. On this trip, Victor finds out more about his father, Arnold, as more than the man that abandoned him as a child, and ultimately forgives him. Plot-wise, this movie is fairly straightforward, all events taking place in the context of Thomas and Victor's  journey, not to mention Victor's own `coming of age'. More important than that is the culturally educational value of this film, revealing more about the modern Native American while entertaining.
  A great point of this movie is to bring awareness of the modern Native American culture to a wider audience. Many comments, visual cues, and symbolic occurrences in the movie are meant to show the audience more of what it is like to be an American Indian today. There are many misconceptions about the life of a modern Native American, which have been skewed by stereotypes established by films in the past (such as that of ""The Lone Ranger""). While these concepts of American Indian culture were relevant long ago, if ever, there is no real understanding of life on the modern reservations to the unrelated audience. There is also little awareness of modern Native American attitudes towards their own situation in a predominantly white America, and how this relates to their sovereign lives on the reservations.
  In ""Smoke Signals"", the characters refer to many historical facts in seemingly everyday conversation. While this may or may not be so in reality, this attention paid to such events (Columbus' landing, the Fourth of July, etc) shows how these events are viewed by the Native American people, in opposition to the greater American population. To the typical American citizen, the Columbus' landing is seen as an honorable event in American history, marking the beginning of the country as we know it today. It's even marked with its own holiday; Columbus Day. To the Native American public, it is understandable if this event is not seen fondly, since this marks the beginning of the decimation of the American Indian way of life up to that time.
  One great complaint that I heard was concerning that of the character Thomas, who in many ways is the quirky side-kick. He also has such annoying habits that he may remind the viewer of Steve Urkel from ""Family Matters"" (comedy relief), or, as the character Victor puts it, one that has seen ""Dances with Wolves"" too many times. But this character needs to be taken more seriously than that. Thomas in his style of dress and mystical behavior, is meant to serve as a foil between the old image of the American Indian (circa 1900 or sooner), and the modern Native America, represented by Victor, in his own attire. This obvious foil is pointed out in the movie, with one predominant scene when Thomas is transformed; this shows the audience how this image is generally not valid anymore.
  The film also brings up issues of racism, in the past and present against the Native American people. These occurrences are seen in jokes concerning stereotypes and even openly racist actions. While this is not the greatest point made in the movie, attitudes such as this needed to be pointed out in a movie depicting this point of view that is different from the greater American population.
  This may seem like a typical `coming of age' story, but there are greater nuances in the plot and writing than seen without analysis. ""Smoke Signals"" is not only an entertaining film, but a window into a culture and view not often seen by the unknowing masses. If you did not find this movie to be enjoyable, I recommend that you look at this film more analytically from a cultural point of view, and see if you think it was truly educational, or completely off the mark",1236038400,2,4016,4.839650145772595
992885,4,6305210101,"The film Smoke Signals is a powerfully authentic film that accurately conveys the real life struggle of modern day Native Americans on reservations.  Although the title can be deceiving, the film is not a traditional cowboys and Indians western with John Wayne leading the way, charging across the plains after savage Indians to save the day.  On the contrary, the film is set on a reservation in northern Idaho in the latter half of the 20th Century and portrays the lives of two cousins, Victor and Thomas, as they grow and deal with tragedy that is unique, yet relatable, for audiences.
 The film's authenticity stems from the fact that it was filmed, produced, and acted by real Native Americans.  Instead of using white actors painted up like Indians and a director intent on making a Hollywood film, the cast and crew of this movie strive to bring across the true meaning of being a modern-day Indian on a real reservation.
 Although the film's main plot stems from a son dealing with the loss of a father who left his family, there is a surprising twist of humor and sarcasm that brings out the tragic past Indians went through to get to where they are today.  It also addresses serious issues like alcoholism and poverty that are all too familiar on every reservation across the United States.  So while the movie is very serious in it's intent to educate people about hard issues in the lives of real Indians, the film also satisfies the audience's need for entertainment and laughter.
 Overall, I very much enjoyed this film and encourage others to watch it for it's historical and contemporary value, as well as for it's entertaining and comical aspects, too.  The key to understanding a certain culture through movies, in my opinion, is to seek out those films that have authentic actors and crewmembers that can properly depict that culture.

I wept for many reasons: hunger and thirst for good native stories; grief of my own and that for my child whose life could well come to resemble any of these characters' - something only time could tell. The script pulls off an important trick: presenting archetypal constants whilst retaining authenticity to The Life.

I recall my gratitude upon the emergence of Alexie: finally! An Indian Writer who is literary, a WRITER first, and then native. Delicious! Smoke Signals was the first of many films breaking away from cheesy characterizations of tribals, the first to move in close and begin to explore native life on the human scale, without losing the very specific inflections therein.

We who live now in an urban landscape scrubbed so free of these inflections, we drank up the sounds and view of Smoke Signals, bathed in genuine music of the speech of The People. There are only two or three flat notes on the part of these actors throughout the film.

This film deserves to stay in its place of importance for breaking us loose of the Ponderosa Ranch!

Victor Joseph and his friend Thomas are taking a road trip. Thomas and Victor are on their way to pay their last respects to Victor's dad who was living in Phoenix. Victor needs some financial assistance and Thomas is willing to help so long as he can go with. Victor needs to come to grips with his past, how he feels about his father who has passed away and he hasn't seen in 10 years, he needs to stop living with a mask on. Thomas seems terribly annoying, but it's Thomas recollections of everything good that help Victor see that not all is lost. Thomas' positive energy helps elevate the mood of the movie as well. Suzy Song is who the boys find when they get to Phoenix, and she fills in the gaps for Victor about his father.

But for two young men, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, (Evan Adams) their lives became entwined when as babies, Victor's father, Arnold (Gary Farmer), saved Thomas's life in a fire that consumed his parents. Arnold, an abusive alcoholic who was traumatized by the tragedy, deserts his family and eventually dies in his trailer in the Arizona desert. The two boys, who have a grating love-hate relationship, travel down to retrieve his remains. Victor is all bottled rage behind his set smile. Thomas is like a tactless Jiminy Cricket, forcing his friend to face his currently unbearable reality. Meeting Suzy Song (Irene Bedard), a neighbor (and surrogate daughter) of Arnold's, the circle of all their lives comes into completion. This film is not so much an ""Indian"" movie as it is a fable about such universal themes of family, betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption seen through Native American eyes. As such, it crosses all ethnic barriers. What makes ""Smoke Signals"" special is how easily it works on several levels, not only past and present, but physical and ethereal as well. All the main characters seem to have two identities that are constantly shifting, their frail humanity giving way to a deep and potent spirit. In particular, Evan Adams's Thomas, all nerdy glasses and geek manner, is revealed as an Old Man Coyote storyteller, whose brazenly outlandish tales carry wisdom and power. The ending scene on a nameless Spokane bridge reaches a level of emotional intensity that mainstream movies are unable (or unwilling) to touch. The first film ever produced, directed, and acted by Native Americans, it won various awards at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.

992958,5,6305210101,"""Smoke Signals"" is a 1998 film based on short stories from Sherman Alexie's book ""Tonto and the Lone Ranger Fistfight in Heaven."" This is one of the first films directed by, written by, acted by and crewed by a full Native American team.

The story is about two unlikely young Native American men who are traveling together to retrieve Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer's) ashes.  Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is the son that Arnold abandoned ten years before when his parents got into a drunken brawl.  Thomas Builds-The-Fire (Evan Adams) is the same age as Victor and was saved by Arnold in a house fire that killed both of his parents.

Both have an entirely different point of view of the man who in a sense gave them their lives.  Along the way, Thomas nearly drives Victor crazy with his storytelling of his father. Victor remains silent and angry about the family's parting.

In Phoenix, they meet Suzy Song (Irene Bedard) who loved Arnold and has an entirely different story to tell.  Nobody's story is completely true, but when all the disjointed pieces come together they make a poetic sense.

Both the journey and the stories are beautifully told with humor and grace.  The music is a great counterpoint to the tale, just enough but not overpowering.

Overall, ""Smoke Signals"" is very watchable and definitely a film I would want to own and recommend to friends.

992959,5,6305210101,"Film is set on an Indian Reservation in Idaho.  This is the first film directly, acted and produced entirely by Native Americans.  The story is centered around Victor and Thomas.  Victor is handsome, athletic and a guy's guy.  Thomas is a short, geeky nerd and relishes in storytelling.  The boys are connected through Victor's Father, who saved Thomas from a fire that killed his parents.  Thomas considers Victor's Father a hero and tells worship-like stories about him.  He is optimistic, upbeat and a dreamer.  Conversely, Victor has to contend with his Father's alcoholism, beatings and verbal abuse - and is a sullen young man who is constantly brooding.  Victor and Thomas grow up together in the neighborhood - not a close friendship but one of a forced alliance.

Eventually, Victor's Father leaves him and his Mother to parts unknown.  Victor learns that his Father dies and he is asked to pick up his Father's ashes and belongings.  Victor leans on Thomas to lend him the money to make the trip to Phoenix, however Thomas will only do so if Victor brings him along the trip.

This is a quirky, funny film - similar to the awarded winning film, Juno.  You feel  the hatred, the love and the longing that Victor has for his Father.

While there is some agenda concerning racial and cultural bias, the film navigates these loaded issues with a delicate hand. There is no strong-arming of the audience here. Ultimately, the story is about the ties that bind us together.

Thomas and Victor are a sensational diad, the perfect odd couple out on an Odyssey of Homeric proportions. Granted, the source and goal of the journey comes from pain, but the characters don't drag their souls through life as eternal victims.

This is a triumphant film, as joyful as it is sad.

Thomas is raised by his grandparents and turns out to be the town nerd-hands down. Victor Joseph grows up stoic and masculine and tough, what you might expect for someone whose father one day walked out on him and his mother and left them to fend for themselves. Word comes that his father has died and his ashes are waiting to be picked up. He has no money for the bus ticket but Thomas does and offers to pay his way if he can go along. They both have very different memories of the man. Which one is the truth? The bus ride and what they discover when they get there is the heart of this often funny, but equally often serious and reflective film. You will chuckle at the 'traffic report' for the Indian radio station. They break to a remote location where a 'reporter' is sitting on the roof of a car in the middle of nowhere and gives a play by play of each car that goes by.

993021,5,6305210101,"This film has far more depth than a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy here is wise and gentle. Whereas I found much of the film humorous, there is a message about the long road to forgiveness and the difficulty of self-acceptance that is very well presented here in the primary character of a young Native man, Victor.

The story revolves around a handsome young Native man, Victor, and the painful experiences he had as a child and youth and as a young man around his relationship with his alcoholic father and himself. The story is also the story of his father, Joseph, and the events he sets in play due to his all too human faults and weaknesses. The story is also the story of Thomas, an odd fellow, who in many ways is a catalyst toward Victor's emotional growth.

Joseph is an alcoholic Native man with a tense relationship with his son, Victor. Alcohol leads Joseph into tragedy, guilt, domestic violence, and alienation from a fine and loving wife and a fine young son. Victor perceives that his father loves alcohol more than he loves his family. This appears to be proven correct when Victor's mother insists that the family become alcohol free and Joseph leaves the family when Victor is around 8 years old, never to return to the reservation and family again. When Joseph dies, and the family gets a phone call from his Native neighbor in Arizona, his son Victor and family friend Thomas, must travel from Idaho to Arizona to claim the ashes and dispose of Joseph's belongings.

The character of Thomas requires some analysis at this point. Thomas was a tiny baby when his parents died in a house fire and Thomas was thrown from a window, caught by Joseph, and then reared by his elderly grandmother. He is oddly unworldly, spiritual and naive, lacking in common sense but acting as a constant irritant to Victor regarding the major emotional force in his life, his feelings of abandonment and loss of love around his father's flight from the family and the reservation on which they live. Victor is never allowed to allow his negative feelings to become deeply buried in his psyche because of the constant irritating comments of Thomas around Joseph's flight. Thomas is the classic trickster in world religions for he appears foolish and lacking in social sense but his constant questions to Victor help spur Victor toward resolution of his inner turmoil. The role of the trickster is to help someone face that which they do not wish to face. He is known as Hermes in Greek myth and Mercury in Roman myth and Coyote in many Native stories. Emotional pain is much like a worm in that it digs deeper and deeper and appears to be gone, but it lies hidden and painfully erupts in relationships and interactions, even at an unconscious level so that we can be victims of long buried hurtful experiences that impact our current lives. This is the primary contribution of Sigmund Freud to world philosophy. However, the trickster, more akin to the psychology of Carl Jung, never lets the pain dig too deep, realizing that the worm must be frequently tricked into showing himself if he is every to be caught. Thomas is the trickster for Victor. His odd questions keep Victor's pain right on the surface.

The literal path of Victor and Thomas is also the emotional and spiritual path for Victor. He obtains the ashes of his father but wishes to flee. Thomas forces him to stay and interact with a young Native woman who befriended Joseph. She sees Joseph in a very different way than Victor. She sees that he loved his family and was able to give up alcohol, but was never able to face the failures of his life. These include the terrible house fire and his relationships with his wife and son. Victor must enter the trailer in the desert where his father dies and go through his belongings. Again this is a symbol from many world religions of the courage required to go in depth into the pain one feels inside to face the monster. The trailer smells of death and yet Victor continues. He finds only mundane items until he finds his father's wallet, in which there is a picture of the family with the word 'home' written on the back. Victor becomes much more aware, thankfully for him, that his father was a mixture of good and bad, like us all. He opens up to the ambiguity of feelings he feels and allows himself to feel the grief of the loss of his father. This duality of feelings and perceptions is symbolized when Victor gives Thomas half of his father's ashes, for in many ways Thomas sees Joseph as a man who always showed him affection and saved him from the house fire. Joseph takes him to Denny's for a breakfast and this meal is symbolic of the support of a father for a child. Joseph was not much of a father to Victor, but through a random act of kindness, he became a mythic and spiritual father for Thomas.  Thomas is an odd spiritual creature who can live a lifetime with such glimpses of fatherhood. However Victor required the real thing, the real flesh and blood immediate father, which Joseph can not provide when burdened with guilt, failure, and alcoholism.

Thomas gives us odd sayings throughout the film, but in the end he tells Victor to throw the ashes into the raging river in Spokane so that his father can become a salmon. What a fine symbol for forgiveness when we allow the pain to leave and swim upriver.",1191801600,4,5346,4.592670157068063
993022,5,6305210101,"Smoke Signals is now one of my favorite movies. The story chronicles the journey of two young Native American men from the Cour d'Alene Indian Reservation in Washington. As we see the two characters progress on their journey to Arizona we also see them evolve in their lives and their respect for each other and those they encounter along the way. This is one of my more favorite movies because it is forward about the realities of reservation life and Native American stereotypes while, at the same time, it still uses an element of magical realism so that the viewer is not completely confused about the Native American characters on the screen.
 The symbolism and the relationship are my favorite parts of this movie because together they show how modern day Native Americans act with their heritage and the modern world. There are so many different elements to how the two characters behave in different environments it is quite obvious that not only non Native Americans fall under the impressions that the stereotypes give off. The best example of this is during the journey to Arizona when Victor tells Thomas to look like an Indian, stone-faced, like they do in all those old movies. Thomas replies by saying that neither one of them is like that, so why should they start now?
 This is an enlightening and entertaining story that involves so many wonderful and memorable characters. The battle between culture and personal beliefs and relationships are brilliantly meshed within the reels of this film. I recommend it to any class or person that wants to see a modern representation of the indigenous people of America and truly understand what it is like to live as a Native American.",1189987200,2,1694,4.858131487889273

993024,5,6305210101,"""Celebrate the comedy that had audiences and critics cheering!"" the CD jacket says ...
I have to ask - did the critic who wrote that see the same film I did?
What I saw was by no means a comedy. There was none of the cheap, cotton-candy, ""feel good and forget it"" humour that we as Americans associate with that word. What I saw wasn't..... funny....

What I did see was: a powerful, poignant, painful and extremely insightful tale of the unfortunate, haunted life of one young boy and his incorrigibly upbeat friend growing up on the Couer D'Alene Indian Reservation (""the Rez"") - then leaving in search of closure to the pain of a father's abandonment ... and his son's tortured unforgiveness....

This movie was a soulish, inward look at what it means/feels like to be a Native American in today's society. It is, however, much more than that: This is a masterfully told story that thoughtfully touches such powerful themes as parental death and desertion, alcoholism and fatherlessness, life as a minority, and that wayward sense of unbelonging afflicting today's capable youth who've yet to find their place in society... I was deeply touched by this film. I'm also appreciative of the fact that there is no gratuituous violence, nor any sex: two elements which, it seems, are used today as a means to assure wide audience appeal. This story needed neither, and it's a tribute to the professionalism of the film's writer, Sherman Alexie, that neither was used.

Smoke Signals was lent to me by a close friend of mine as a means to a glimpse inside his world as a Native American. I found it an enlightening, thought provoking, and emotionally stirring experience.

The film ends with this poignant monologue:

""How do we forgive our fathers?
Maybe in a dream?
Do we forgive our fathers for leaving us too often
- or forever -
when we were little?
Maybe for scaring us with unexpected rage?
Or making us nervous because there never seemed to be
Any rage there at all?
Do we forgive our fathers
For marrying - or not marrying - our mothers?
Or divorcing - or not divorcing - our mothers?
And shall we forgive them for their excess of warmth - or coldness?
Shall we forgive them for pushing or leaning...
For shutting doors - for speaking through walls...
Or for never speaking at all... or never being silent?
Do we forgive our fathers in our age - or in theirs?
Or in their death, saying it to them - or not saying it?
If we forgive our fathers....
What is left..?

Overall I really enjoyed it, but it was sort of obtuse.  I heartily enjoyed ""Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"" and when I viewed Smoke Signals I thought ""Whoa!  They must have pried this from Sherman Alexie's hands and ran with it!  I'm surprised he didn't insist on having his name taken off it!""  I was surprised to find out that he co-produced it and wrote the screenplay!

The acting could have been better, although I thought Thomas Builds-the-fire was very cute with his braids and big smile.  It bothered me that the characters in this movie were constantly expounding on the fact that they were Indian.  They brought it up every couple of minutes!  Somehow, I doubt that that is what real Indians do.  We know you're Indian, you don't have to state it.  ""What are you going to trade us?  Because we're Indian, remember?  We barter!""  I would think that most Indians don't see a lot of novelty in the fact that they are Indian and these characters certainly did.  This made it seem like the film was presenting ""Indians"" in third person rather than letting them be themselves.  It would have been improved if it had been a little more natural and less self-conscious.

993062,5,6305210101,"Sherman Alexie's Smoke Signals is a heart-warming story that delves deep into the heart of the Native American culture. Alexie's realistic point of view is a refreshing change from the typical stereotypes represented in most other films about the Native American culture. Smoke signals chronicles the adventure of an unlikely pair who can't seem to find common ground. It is brilliantly humorous and introduces new perspectives on this amazing culture.

  The lead, Victor Joseph, is played by actor Adam Beach. He constantly struggles with the fact that his father abandoned him when he was just a boy, and can't seem to find peace with himself or with life. His journey of self-actualization begins, though, when he hears news of his fathers death and travels across the United States to pick up his fathers remains. That is when Thomas Builds-the-Fire, played by Evan Adams, comes in. He is an extremely goofy person, who never seems to fit in. Victor reluctantly allows Thomas to accompany him on his trip, only because Thomas supplies the money to get there. Both Beach's and Adams' performances are enjoyable, but Adams really steals the spotlight. With his random, enjoyable stories and his charming innocence, he leaves audiences delighted throughout the story.

  Alexie does a magnificent job with this film. It is enlightening, educational, and entertaining. The way he uses the camera angles, the lighting, and the actors makes the audience feel as though they are a part of this journey as well.  His approach to documenting Indian life is unbiased as well because he does not try to mask the imperfections. This story is truthful and unique, and its simplicity is absolutley charming.

993117,5,6305210101,"Can I get the version with the bonus deleted scenes in which the two boys send a little e-mail to Suzy Song, apologizing for abusing her hospitality and sneaking out at the dead of night?  I really miss those scenes and I feel that in the butchered version of the movie, Victor never really does learn anything.  He inherits from his father the great fauly of running away (cowardice) which ruined his life up until Suzy's phone call.  We see her towards the last half of the movie utterly changed by the ingratitude of the boys.

Was she supposed to be too old to be romantically interested in Adam Beach?  I don't think so!  Sparks fly between them as actors, but the script carefully tiptoes past any hint of a romance.  Maybe the director felt that involving Suzy with both father and son bordered on the incestuous but, hey, it worked with father and son and now that Arnold Joseph was dead, the message for her should be, time to move on to the luscious, lean, chiseled son played by Adam Beach with a muscular intenstity reminiscent of Alain Delon's brooding profile in Visconti's ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS.  I kept watching SMOKE SIGNALS admiring the way Chris Eyre took many of Visconti's tropes--for surely he is a fan of ROCCO as well as many other midperiod Visconti masterpieces--and turned them on their head, reigniting them for a new generation.  Though in my opinion by eliminating all sexuality he threw the baby out with the bathwater.

Maybe Evan Adams' character was supposed to be in love with Adam Beach's.  The movie is pretty feeble without that suggestion, for why else would Thomas offer his life savings to Victor, and why would he be so excited and tremulous about the prospect of spending six days with him, side by side, braids flapping about his shoulders like wings?  In the hospital the young woman tells the boys, ""You two are my heroes.  You're just like the Lone Ranger and Tonto.""  When Thomas replies, ""More like Tonto and Tonto"" you could hear the groans all over the theater because it was such a lame setup.",1160611200,5,2046,4.631578947368421

Victor, abandoned by his father, Arnold Joseph, at the age of 12 becomes a bully but that is not the end of the story.  It is the story of surviving a dying culture where everything is magical with the help of humor, imagination, and forgiveness.  But the culture lives on in stories such as this.

It was among the first successful Native American films to be completely made and performed by Native Americans and Native Americans only. Smoke Signals turns the table on clich American/Western films by showing the context from a converse point of view. The amount of films that actually stand behind the Native Americans and exploit the white man's wrong doings can barely be counted on two hands. Therefore, after decades of watching ""Vicious"" Indians hunt down harmless white folks on the prairie and being consistently exposed to the ""typically"" un-humorous and stone face Indian people on film, Smoke Signals defies all of those odds and actually begins to poke fun of the Caucasian people who have stereotyped them for so long. This film manages to pack itself with quite a bit of humor, but at the same time a hefty amount of seriousness and conveys the Indian point of view on many bias issues.

Because Smoke Signals is written, directed, produced, and mostly acted by Native Americans, this film does not portray the typical Indian stereotype viewers are so used to seeing.  Instead viewers are able to see what life on a reservation is really like.  Through the various camera angles the director chooses to use, he makes the viewer feel like they are on the reservation. They get to experience the poverty and discrimination put upon Native Americans in various scenes. For example, the movie opens with a pan of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in northwestern Idaho. With this pan the viewer is able to get a sense of what it was like to live on a reservation-most live in trailers and most of the cars on the reservation must be driven backwards because they have no transmission.  However it is scenes like this that make the movie so enjoyable.  The director uses everyday problems like this and adds humor to them making the viewer laugh.  He also uses the humor to attack some of the stereotypes that are put on Indians such as bartering, chanting, story telling and drinking.

Overall I would highly recommend this movie.  Smoke Signals is a perfect blend of humor, emotion, and culture.

993188,5,6305210101,"Throughout history, filmmakers have portrayed Native Americans as the savage head scalpers of the rugged American plains.  In the movie Smoke Signals, the Native American point of view is shown clearly through the daily life and situations one might face living on an Indian Reservation in the 1990's.  This film takes a step out of dominant American society and directly into the heart of the Coeur d'Alene reservation in northwestern Idaho.

 The movie begins with introducing two strikingly different main characters, Victor Joseph, played by Adam Beach, and Thomas Builds-the-fire, played by Evan Adams.  The two characters couldn't be more opposite and are forced to bond together when Victor's father dies in Phoenix after leaving him and his mother in Victor's childhood and the only way to get there is through funding by Thomas with the condition that Thomas can tag along.  Thomas comes across as the small nerdy kid is class that says whatever is on his mind whether you want to hear it or not.  Victor, on the other hand, is the strong athletic leader that any Indian on the reservation has respect for.  As the two go about their journey, Victor is faced with confronting his less than perfect childhood in which his father was an abusive alcoholic to both him and his mother.  His father's drunken state is all that Victor sees when his father name is brought up, which is often thanks to the prodding questions by Thomas who adores Victor's father for saving him in a fire that was inadvertently started while Victor's dad was in his usual drunken state.  It takes much prodding by Thomas as well as the retelling of Victor's fathers last days by his neighbor from Phoenix for Victor to finally forgive his father and begin the mourning process that was long overdue.

 The movie itself is packed full of Indian humor and unique film techniques that add to the viewing experience.  The director of the film uses flashbacks to show situations in Victor's past to show the audience the reasons behind his hatred toward his father.  The film also has many instances in which there are underlying meanings to things said relating to Native American history across the nation.  It also implants values such as the importance of oral tradition, through many of Thomas's stories, as well as subtle hints towards being a family and tribe.  This movie is overflowing with messages that should be taken to heart and wisdom useful to everyone.  This movie reaches into the depths of character and pulls out a comedic journey, although painful at times, that can be enjoyed and appreciated by anyone looking to an alternative to the traditional portrayal of Native Americans in the film industry.",1140566400,2,2699,4.896703296703297

993190,4,6305210101,"Most of us have seen numerous cowboy and Indian films, all told from some variation of the white man's point of view. The richness of this film, however, is that it is a story by Native Americans, about Native Americans and acted by Native Americans--- Indians, as they call themselves in the movie. The film opens up on a clear morning on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in northwestern Idaho. The KREZ deejay pronounces, ""It's a good day to be indigenous."" The rest of the movie lets the viewer in on some of the aspects of being `indigenous'.

 The movie involves a road trip. Though not in a car, but a bus. Victor, a young man in his early twenties, is informed of his father's death in AZ and needs to go there to retrieve the man's belongings. The reservation nerd, Thomas, offers Victor all of his savings, contained in a Mason jar, to make the trip. Thomas's one condition is that he gets to go along. Victor and Thomas mix about as well as water and oil, or...cowboys and Indians. Victor is good looking, athletic and a leader. Thomas is the Steve Urkel of the reservation. He always says the wrong thing at the wrong time. He is particularly aggravating to Victor due to his constant reminiscing about the father who left Victor and his mother ten years earlier. Thomas himself has been told from early boyhood that Victor's dad, Arnold, saved him when his family's home was burning to the ground. In Thomas's frequent recollections, which aren't always truthful, Arnold is a hero. Victor, on the other hand, remembers his father as a drinker and wife beater, someone who couldn't tame his rage. Ultimately, he remembers him as the father who left and didn't come back.  Victor's heartache and bitterness are explained through flashbacks to scenes of him and his father in earlier days. By the end of the movie both young men have a better understanding and appreciation of each other and Arnold.

 Indian humor is evident from the beginning of the film and woven throughout. Lester Fallsapart gives a daily traffic report for KREZ from his broken down van, even though there is no traffic. When Victor asks how he knew of Arnold's death Thomas gets a mystical look on his face and answers, ""I heard it on the wind. I heard it from the birds. I felt it in the sunlight. And your mom was just in here cryin'."" My favorite part of the movie is the scene in which Thomas and Victor get a ride from local girls Velma and Lucy, who are cruising down the road backwards. Now that is quite a feat, when you think about it. I myself can't drive backwards for too long before swerving into a mailbox or another vehicle. But these girls have had some practice and do it for long distances. On top of that, they are hilarious. After listening wide-eyed to one of Thomas's tall tales about Arnold Joseph, they pronounce that it is a good example of the oral tradition and worthy of barter for a ride. When the guys get out of the car to finish their trip off the reservation, Velma and Lucy warn them about needing to have passports to travel to a foreign country. Victor and Thomas look at them bewildered, and reply that it's the United States. Lucy responds, ""Damn right it is! That's as foreign as it gets. Hope you two have your vaccinations.""

 This isn't an overly exciting film. There are no expressions of outrage or bitterness toward the dominant white culture, no shooting or scalping. There are only a few glimpses of alcoholism and the destruction it causes. The young reservation men spend their time playing basketball, not doing drugs or chasing women. The only cowboy in the film is John Wayne; actually just a chant about his mysterious teeth. (""John Wayne's teeth, are they real? Are they plastic or are they steel?"") The movie is rich, however, in it's telling of everyday life on the reservation. Rich enough for me to ask for more and hope that other Native Americans will produce movies that give further glimpses into their culture.",1136678400,3,3953,4.614509246088193

I found the film to be a good film for all ages, but there is a scene or two which I had to cringe at (when the father, in the boys memory, smacks him hard for doing something bad, or when the boys parents foght infront of him).

In fact, I've never seen a Native American Nerd before, but I can say now after watching the movie that I have.  :-)  Still I give this film a 4 mainly because it was a great film, but in a way it lacks in the story-telling part of it, which is partly because of some limited acting skills.

He talked about his writing and this film called Smoke Signals.  The interviewer, who happens to be a movie critic, gave it high praise.  So on to Amazon I went and ordered this DVD.  This is a wonderful little movie about friendship and family.  The direction, by Chris Eyre, is great and the movie is visually appealing, with notable dialogue.  (Sherman Alexie wrote the screenplay.)  Victor as played by Adam Beach had a troubled childhood marked by all things that plague Native Americans in 20th Century United States.  Throughout his life he has been befriended by Thomas, played supperbly by Evan Adams.  Thomas was saved, as a small child, by Victor's father.  Victor's father has been gone from the family for 10 years.  Victor is full of swagger and self-confidence, Thomas on the other hand is kind of a nerdy nudge.  But, God puts us where He wants us and it seems that it is Thomas' mission, so to speak, to help Victor come to terms with his past.  Smoke Signals should be seen by all and shown in most of our school systems.  I think a lot of stereotypes about Native Americans still prevail in this society.  The screenwriter does an excellent job of showing us that Native Americans are people, who in many ways, deal with the same issues you and I do, but also have the added burden of a social structure that seems ever in conflict.  Buy this DVD watch it, but watch it with your family.  A great film.",1111708800,5,1561,4.4787234042553195

993259,1,6305210101,"...and its (anything, but) subtle use of symbolism, you might enjoy this movie also.  It's been a while since seeing 'Smoke Signals' seven years ago at it's release, but glancing through these reviews I thought that I should give the readers another viewpoint....  The acting was hilarious (if you've ever studied acting you'll be cringing till your stomach hurts).  The plot was ridiculous and tedious and directionless.  And there was no more insight to this film than you might find in an episode of Dawson's Creek.  I remember this movie because it has always stood out for me as one the ten worst films I've ever seen.  But, I am definitely in the minority.  I've never heard anyone say ANYTHING bad about the movie (other than the two other folks I saw it with).  That's very rare for any film not titled 'Citizen Cane'.  As an entirely Native American offering, perhaps it wouldn't be prudent for 'liberal' types (I include myself in that category, btw) to criticize this work.  That is, perhaps, unfair for me to speculate on, but I am just so puzzled at people's reaction to the film.  It's not that it's a bad movie that people seem to have formed some attachment to; it's that it is so incredibly bad!  But what are the chances that you'd agree with me and not the other, obviously intelligent folks, who've I've spoken to about this film, and who've written here?

P.S. If you'd like to see a bad film from 1998 why not try 'Godzilla'?  There may not be any 'dumping daddy's ashes in the river' moments, but the dialog is a notch above.",1108771200,10,1548,4.581818181818182
993260,5,6305210101,"Shortly after receiving my driver's license I decided to take a road trip through Nebraska. At one point in my journey I suddenly noticed Indians everywhere--driving down the road, sitting in parking lots off the state highway, and standing in front of decrepit looking buildings. ""What's going on here?"" I said to myself, not knowing at the time that I was cruising through the Winnebago reservation in Northern Nebraska. I always tell this story to friends nowadays, especially ones who champion Native American rights, and it never fails to get a laugh. Why? Because they know most of us rarely encounter Indians, let alone spend any time on reservations. Out here in the Midwest, you will still meet Native Americans from time to time outside of reservations. If you live on the East or West Coast of the United States, however, you probably have little interaction with Indians. Oh, you might have seen one on a college campus, or know someone who knows someone who has some ""Indian blood"" flowing through their veins, but most Americans have only seen Indians in old photographs or on television. In short, most of us have little idea about the lives of modern day Native Americans.

Director Chris Eyre's three films, ""Skins,"" ""Skinwalkers,"" and ""Smoke Signals,"" put Indian characters center stage. ""Smoke Signals"" is the story of Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds the Fire (Evan Adams), two young men living on a reservation in Idaho. Years before the events we see in the film, Victor's father Arnold (Gary Farmer) rescued Thomas from a house fire that claimed the lives of his parents. The deed assumed, rightfully so, legendary dimensions on the reservation, and no one promotes this magnificent act more than Thomas Builds the Fire. A geeky, frequently poetic soul prone to rambling statements of epic sweep in a voice that could melt eardrums, Thomas annoys Victor to no end. It isn't the tone of Thomas voice or even his penchant for storytelling that works on Victor's last nerve, but the lionization of his father Arnold. A few years after the rescue, Arnold ran out on his son and wife and headed to Arizona. That he never returned angers Victor to end, almost as much as his recollections of Arnold's abusive behavior and chronic alcoholism. Thomas never saw any of this behavior, so his recollections revolve around the rescue and the day Arnold took the boy out to breakfast at a restaurant. These two differing perspectives of the same man form the crux of ""Smoke Signals.""

One day Victor learns that his father has passed away and that he must go to Arizona to collect the man's ashes. Unfortunately for him, he can only afford to make the journey when Thomas offers to pay for the bus trip. Of course, Thomas insists on going along. What follows are a series of adventures, some amusing and some serious, as the two young men draw closer and closer to fulfilling their task. In a hilarious scene on the bus, Victor instructs Thomas on how to act like a real Indian (quit grinning like an idiot, adopt a serious mien) and gets into an argument with a passenger claiming to be a former Olympic gymnast. Victor Joseph doesn't appear to suffer fools kindly, and he often takes his anger about his life out on complete strangers, something that completely mystifies his friend Thomas. Victor's bad attitude continues once the two reach Arnold's trailer out in the desert. It appears that Arnold Joseph took up with Suzy Song (Irene Bedard), a beautiful young woman who also has many positive memories of the man. At first, Victor can barely stand listening to Suzy and Thomas exchanging these happy tales, but he eventually begins to understand that his father had a side he never knew about.

I've seen all three Chris Eyre films, and I have to say that ""Smoke Signals"" is the most ""Indian"" of the three in that the answers to the story aren't offered to the audience on a silver platter. A person watching this film must actually think about what is happening onscreen or they won't get anything out of it. You might laugh a few times, about the aforementioned ""act like an Indian"" scene or the amusing KREZ traffic reporter sitting on the top of a broken down van at the side of an abandoned road, but you won't pick up on any of the emotional and psychological themes. I took the movie as an examination of how any one individual embodies both good and bad traits, and that these traits inspire different responses in different people. No one recollection of a person defines who that person is in their sum total, and only by learning different perspectives about someone can we even begin to approach the truth about that individual's real identity. Of course, I could be completely wrong. The good thing about ""Smoke Signals"" is that you can take away multiple meanings from the film and still enjoy the performances, the humor, and the drama.

Another great element, found in all of Chris Eyre's films, is his refusal to play the often tiresome political correctness card. His movies always contain a few references to indignities Indians suffer and continue to suffer in this country, but he always relegates such comments to just one aspect of their existence. The director's concerns rest more on presenting his characters as real people dealing with universal human problems than worrying about who broke what treaty back in the nineteenth century. Chris Eyre is a magnificent director who could probably lens a film in any genre with any cast and do a wonderful job. I hope he keeps working in the future.",1104969600,5,5548,4.800209205020921
993261,4,6305210101,"The simple shorthand for Smoke Signals would be to call it a Native American coming of age film, without the almost requisite sex that proliferates in the genre.  It rates more than passing interest for being entirely made by a Native American cast and crew and, to those unfamiliar with his work, as an introduction to the excellent Native American short story writer Sherman Alexie, who I assume, perhaps wrongly, to be partially embodied in the Thomas Builds-the-Fire character.  The plot line of cool guy and geek go to pick up cool guy's Dad's ashes far from the Coeur d'Alene reservation moves at its own pace with many deadpan or telling vignettes along the way.  Check out, for example, the KREZ traffic reports, the Olympic team alternate gymnast the boys meet on the bus, Thomas' swagger in his new clothes, and the unexpected kindness from a rural sheriff.  There's not anything here that will take your breath away, but Smoke Signals is strongly recommended for its careful craft and fine realization.",1100304000,3,1013,4.906432748538012
993262,5,6305210101,"I want to start out by saying Sherman Alexie is probably one of the greatest writers of our time.  When I say ""greatest writers"" I don't mean ""greatest NATIVE writers"" or ""greatest writers of COLOR,"" I mean Greatest Writers.  Mr. Alexie manages to capture the most universal emotions (grief, joy, heartbreak, anguish) and make the excessible to all, yet he also brings his own unique flavor, style and ironic wit to the mix so we are never bored.  I can honestly say that Smoke Signals is one of those films that is really dear to my heart for many reasons, and the screenplay by Alexie definitely is one of the contributing factors.
For starters, there are so many classic lines in this film.  The first being that line I used as the subject for this review.  ""It is a good day to be Indigenous.""  I don't think we hear that everyday!  The negative view of native people even today is really disturbing, and I think when people regardless of background see the portrayal of indigenous people in films, television shows, literature and education it continues to horrify and astound us all.
Secondly, the story is a wonderful and important one that I think everyone can relate to.  It touches on the theme of fathers and the relationship with their children.  Victor (Adam Beach) is an bitter, angry and distrustful young man who grew up on the Coeur D'Alene ""Rez"" with his bespectacled friend/nemesis Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams). These young men are growing up in a culture separate from mainstream white culture--a culture they eventually leave when they go to retrieve the ashes of Victor's deceased father.  What starts out as a road trip turns into something more significant than either of them could've imagined.  It becomes ceremonial, and a real opportunity for maturity that changes their relationships with each other and themselves.
Finally, the acting is wonderful.  The lead actors are engaging, believable and sympathetic.  The supporting cast is strong and they really capture the essence of Alexie's novels.  When I read TONTO AND LONE RANGER FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN (specifically the short story, ""This is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona,"" which the film was based on), the way I envisioned the characters (how they would look, how they would talk, etc) matched the image exactly!
Take it from me, a Sherman Alexie fan and self-proclaimed ""culture vulture"".....this film is all that and a stack of fry bread!",1086393600,37,2435,4.921760391198044
993263,5,6305210101,"One of the greatest underrated movies ever made!
Most of the emotional bite is taken from Sherman Alexie's ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"" leaving a great yet simple story about two Indians (Alexie himself dislikes the label ""Native American"") on the road from the upper Northwest to Arizona. The mission: collect the remains of the father of Victor Joseph-- played with great complexity by Adam Beach. Along for the ride is Thomas, the local reservation geek who brings along with him a vast array of stories from the past mixed with humor and pain played with resilence by Evan Adams, to the constant annoyance of Victor who has no time for stories or memories, only ""truth"" and the present tense.
This movie is a series of vignettes as the two travel off the reservation (""You're leavin' the Rez and going into a whole different country cousin."" ""But it's the United States."" ""Damn right it is, that's as foreign as it gets!"") and into the wilderness of forgotten memories and rough landscape. Mixed in with the ponderings of what it means to be indeginous in America and who makes the best fry-bread is a great soundtrack which includes Dar Williams and Ulali.
This movie does not try to be more than it is: the story of two young men trying to find their place in the world with humor and anger. Director Chris Eyre keeps the story and the settings simple and the flashbacks flow fluidly from one iteration to the next.

However, as the story unfolds, you realize that themes emerge that we can all relate to - pain, abandonment, disappointment, anger, loneliness.

993364,5,6305210101,"I work as a psychotherapist with adolescents and young adults. I use ""Smoke Signals"" with them by assigning them to rent and view the movie, which is always enjoyable because it's witty, humorous, wise, and significant. The movie poses two essential questions: 1) If someone else has mistreated, hurt, abandoned, or disrespected you, is it possible to forgive them if they've NEVER asked forgiveness, never done anything to ""put it right,"" never returned in atonement to undo the damage, and never begtun to deserve it? And 2) if it *is* possible--and it may not be--SHOULD you? Because if you do, doesn't that just make you a willing victim by letting them ""get away"" with what they did, and pretending the relationship is okay again?
Victor lives in the tension of this dilemma. As a 12-year-old youth, he witnessed the effects of alcohol on his family. His father vascillated between being loving and instantly ""turning"" to become hostile, violent, and humiliating to the young boy. Victor finds himself becoming more deeply embarrassed by his family's domestic abuse and alcohol use, even defiantly scolding his own father that his favorite Indian is ""Nobody...nobody...nobody!""
Victor's mother awakens the next morning to see Victor angrily smashing his father's beer bottles on the back of his father's picup truck (the two things he believes his father loves more than him), and the epiphany stuns the mother, who insists on an immediate end to family drunkenness. Proving Victor's fears true, the father--forced to choose between alcohol and family--flees the family, and never returns. It is within that unchanged arrangement that his father dies, 8 years later, having never returned home.
Victor and his oddball companion Thomas make a side-splittingly funny journey south from Idaho to Phoenix together to make arrangements for the father's possessions, confronted by the racism, peculiarities, and hostilities of the non-Indian ""outside"" world. Thomas, having never seen the dark side of Victor's father, irritates Victor with incessant stories and tales about the dad's greatness.
Victor, having been so deeply wounded and sold-out by his father's abandonment, has become tough, fierce, aggressive...and lonely. ""You can't trust anyone!"" he scolds. ""People will walk all over you!"" His mistrust poisons his friendships, family, and feelings about his father. He's become just another tough guy, hardened by family violence and substance use.
In Phoenix, Victor finds an essential artifact of his father's life: a worn-out photo with ""HOME"" written sloppily on it. At once, Victor begins to realize that his father's fatal flaw was COWARDICE: the father could confess his sins to new companions a thousand miles from home, but could never return home and undo the damage he'd caused. And so his son has suffered for 8 years. Victor begins to realize that he himself is allowing his actions to damage others, and that it is cowardice, not manly independence, that controls his decision to remain distant and fierce.
Victor slowly begins to repent of his own abusive toughness, cutting his hair in symbolic repentance (traditional hair-cutting is done either in grief, or in repentence for shameful behavior). The process of discovery continues when Thomas angrily confronts Victor about Victor's own behavior: remaining cold and distant from his own mother, acting forceful and ruthless to others, etc.
Victor ends the film by freeing himself of his 8-year hostility toward his unforgiven father, and in that final act of forgiveness we find that the greatest benefit is for VICTOR, who becomes kinder, funnier, gentler, and more confident in his friendships. The significance of forgiveness, he learns, isn't to let someone else off the hook, but to let one's own self off the hook of the pain caused by another, rather than carrying that pain inside for years.
In the final scene, this release of aged anger is represented by the cathartic release of his father's ashes into a river, meaningfully shown in film montage as expanding in power from streams into torrents, much like the energy of either a person enraged or a person set free.
It is at the end of the film that we really begin to understand Thomas' original cryptic remark at the beginning, ""Some children aren't really children at all. They're just pillars of flame that burn everything they touch. And some children are just pillars of ash, and they fall apart as soon as you touch them.""

Alexie strives to break down the steriotypes built up by the classic westerns and all the other cowboy and indian movies by playing on those very steriotypes.  He also uses natural settings and Native American actors (unlike so many other films about Indians that use white guys in brown make-up).

Smoke Signals offers a glimpse of contemporary life on the Coeur d'Alene Indian reservation in northern Idaho.  While the film holds special appeal to viewers interested in Indian culture, it simultaneously transcends cultural differences with its universal themes of family, friendship, loss, grief and forgiveness.  Although a comedy in part, this movie is truly a ""soulful journey"" as portrayed in its trailer.
Listen carefully to the beautiful soundtrack.  The melancholy vocals of Jim Boyd (lyrics co-authored with Sherman Alexie) say as much as the script.

993447,4,6305210101,"Ah yes, it's a great day to be indigenous.  Chris Eyre's Sundance busting, feature-film debut is the first film written, produced, and shot entirely by Native Americans, and also shares the distinction of being Native American (or Indian, as he prefers to be called) writer Sherman Alexie's first big-screen conversion of his brilliant prose.  The second, Alexie-directed ""The Business of Fancydancing,"" is currently playing the festival circuit, but ""Smoke Signals"" remains more of a family-oriented, character-driven film and one that will become both a cult and film-school classic.
The movie follows two young men, Victor and Thomas, as they set off on a road trip to pick up Victor's father's things.  Victor's father was an abusive drunk, and left when Victor was young.  Victor grew up to be a bit of an egotistical, surly brat (although not nearly as much as he was in the books), and only takes the nerdy, storytelling Thomas with him because otherwise could not afford the trip.  Along the way, the two discover a little about themselves as Indians, and their place in American society as well as in their own families.  Not exactly an action movie, but the brilliant acting, great scriptwriting (you just KNOW that most of this came from Alexie's real-life experiences) and simple heart of the film carry it through some potentially dull and clich moments.
Miramax's DVD presentation simply doesn't do the film justice.  There's a crisp, but fairly un-dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but the film is presented in letterboxed widescreen instead of anamorphic.  The print is clean and clear, but it's gonna look crummy on high-end home theaters no matter how you shake it.  There are no extras to speak of, either, which is a shame since of all the movies released with boatloads of extra features (Rush Hour 2, for example), a film like this, of interest to people and filmmakers alike, NEEDS those sorts of features.
I first saw this movie in Tulsa with an Indian friend from high school.  We had the theatre to ourselves, and laughed and cried throughout.  Smoke Signals is worth checking out, and if you enjoy it, use it as a gateway to educate yourself about Indians and Indian literature.  This DVD, while minimal, looks to be the best version we're going to see for quite a while (Miramax hasn't even gotten around to re-releasing Pulp Fiction yet, or Swingers, let alone Smoke Signals).  It's priced nice, too.  If you have doubts, rent it, but do yourself a favor and see it one way or another.

I didn't know what to expect, although I have read books by Sherman Alexie in the past, I could not imagine how he could adapt any of his books to a screenplay.  This movie was adapted from his book of short stories ""THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN"", which I also recommend.
The movie starts out with a poetic narration by Thomas Builds-the-Fire, played by Evan Adams.  This pivotal scene builds the story and introduces all the key players.
I don't want to give too much away, but it is a very clever portrayal of two twenty-something Native American men dealing with their very different lives, as they are forced together by circumstance.
Adam Beach who plays Victor Joseph is an archetypal stoic Native American man and his `sidekick' Thomas is the stereotypical non-natives view of what an Indian should be.  Alexie plays on this stark contrast which gives you moments of laughter as well as moments of reaching for the Kleenex.
This movie is filled with symbolism and bits and pieces from Alexie's own life.
This movie is good for children ten and above. Although I have heard younger children really like it as well, but the content may be too mature for them.

993451,5,6305210101,"There have been precious few movies about Native Americans in the last decade. Perhaps this is because the fate of the original inhabitants of this nation will forever be a sad and controversial chapter in history. Movies are a huge entertainment machine, and the subject is not usually seen as being a crowd-pleaser.
Enter Smoke Signals. This delightful, off beat comedy-drama is primarily a Native Americans production. From its unique vantage point, we are shown that they do, indeed exist and that, regardless of the circumstances some of them live in, the human spirit often still triumphs.
Most of the picture was filmed on a reservation in Idaho. The rest takes place in Seattle and in Phoenix. It is a fascinating portrayal of two young Coeur D'Alcoc men named Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire. Thomas, played by Adam Beach, is a bookish boy who is in touch with the sprit world. His parents were killed in a 4th of July fire when he was an infant. Saved by Victor's father, her was raised by his grandmother. The boys have grow up together, but could not be more different. Victor is a hot tempered jock who bears several grudges. He feels that his being born on a reservation is an enormous handicap, and he resents his father's leaving him when he was ten years old.
In less capable hands, life on the reservation would appear grim, but director Chris Eyre has a gift for seeing the humor in a situation. The tribe has a radio station, for example. Every morning it has a rush hour report, which consists of a reporter sitting on top of a truck at the nearest highway and commenting on the few cars that pass buy. The truck has not moved since it broke down twenty years ago. In another instance, two teenage girls drive around in an old car which only runs in reverse. These amusing scenes gently show both the poverty and the isolation of the reservation, which is so different from the rest of American that it looks like it's in a third world country.
Victor and his mother learn that his Dad has died in Phoenix. He must go there to get the remains, and he reluctantly lets Thomas accompany him. Thomas is forever telling stories about real events, but he always puts a spiritual meaning into them. This drives Victor up the wall.
On the road to Phoenix, bits and pieces from their past are revealed. We learn the truth about the death of Thomas' parents, and we find out why Victor's father really left. This is done in constant but smooth shifts from present to past which.
This small movie has much more to say - and says it better - than the average big budget production. Issues are addressed which make the audience more aware of the Native American experience, but the tone is objective. It allows its young heroes to take responsibility for their own actions.
Adam Beach and Evan Adams are outstanding actors, and Chris Eyre directs in a straightforward and sure handed way. Some scenes may seen a little amateurish, which is due to the movie's very low budget. These few rough edges do not prevent Smoke Signals from being one of the best American independent films of 1998.",1017187200,3,3107,4.630434782608695

This movie will make you laugh your head off (if you've had your refresher course in American Indian Humor 101 then it's even funnier) and at the same time it will pull at your heart until you are fighting to understand these people and who they truly are.
I highly recommend it.
On the lighter side?  I absolutely loved Thomas (Evan Adams).  Pay close attention to the tales he tells.  Kind of an American Indian Aesop.  I just want to reach out and squeeze his beautiful self.
Victor (Adam Beach) is the macho man through the whole thing.  The typically thought of stoic, serious indian.  Oh, how wrong it is.  Just wait 'til you see those pearly whites.
OH yeah!  One more thing.  In the end you get to meet grandma.  Grandparents are a very important part of American Indian cultures.  They are usually the ones who teach the children in the ways of right and wrong within most of our traditions.  So when you hear Thomas talk about grandma, pay attention.  You'll learn a little more about our peoples.
By the time all is said and done, you will find a new respect of teenagers, the American Indian peoples, and quite possibly for yourself, your family, and your loved ones.",1012867200,6,1588,4.512280701754386
993521,5,6305210101,"""Smoke Signals"" was the first movie to be written, directed, and co-produced by a Native American. It is based on the novel ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"" by Sherman Alexie, who also published a movie adaptation of ""Smoke Signals"" as well.
The majority of the cast is from a variety of Canadian First Nations tribes (Coast Salish, Cree, Cayuga, Ojibwa), so there are different cultural backgrounds at work as well. ""Smoke Signals"" is a journey of the heart, an exploration of what it means to be Indian, venturing into the world outside the rez. Thomas's stories are part Indian legend, part reweaving of the facts surrounding Victor and his father.
The story follows Victor Joseph as he goes to collect the remains of his father, who had abandoned his family and moved to Arizona (the film's working title was ""This Is What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona,"" based on a chapter of ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven."" His wise friend Thomas Builds-the-Fire goes with him on a trip from their rez in Coeur-d'Alene, Idaho to Arnold Joseph's trailer in Arizona. Along the way they rediscover their pasts and their perceptions of the world around them.
An unusual, touching film that pokes fun at the stoic Indian stereotypes endorsed by Hollywood for decades, such as the ""It's a good day to die"" line. There are many notable First Nations actors (Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Tantoo Cardinal, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Elaine Miles) that make this film a joy to watch. Inspired performances from all, especially Adam Beach and Gary Farmer.

However, it's freshness, originality and irreverent modern view of their world more than made up for these faults.
The story centers on two young men, Victor and Thomas, who leave their Idaho resevaton to bring back the remains of one the young men's father who had left ten years before.  The early part of the film features sharp humorous dialog which turns some stereotypes around.  For example, Victor tells Thomas that to look like a proper Indian he should stop smiling and look serious, like he just finished killing a buffalo.  Thomas answers that their tribe didn't kill buffalos -- they were fishermen.  As the story progresses, though, it gets more serious.  Told in flashbacks and voiceovers, the role of the father is superbly created by Gary Farmer a large size actor with a huge talent.  He deserves top billing along with the two young men, played by Adam Beach and Evan Adams.  The film is strongest when dealing with the relationship between sons and fathers.  There are some very moving moments around this theme.

I was not to be disappointed.
Smoke Signals is the story of a boy, Victor Joseph, who is a native american, dealing with his ties to his father in a society as alien to many Europeans as any sci fi author could portray.  The story weaves its way through Joseph's life, from birth, to coming of age and dealing with the death of his father.  It also deals with the world of friendship, talismanism, cowboys versus 'indians,' and redemption of all of these things...and more.
If you are expecting to see big name actors in this movie, then I'm sorry to say that you will be sorely disappointed.  The only 'big name' actor I saw was Tom Skerritt and he did a poor job.  However, the other actors (almost all of whom are native americans) play their parts incredibly well, pulling you into their lives, and tugging at your spirit and heart.

You really think you won't encounter THE ONE ACTOR who almost literally shows up everywhere. You would, though, be wrong. You watch the film, some scenes shown in flashback sequence, seeing how one of the characters has been abandoned by his alcoholic father, how depressing the life on the reservation can be, and how society on an Indian reservation functions from the point of view of the writer. The father has apparently never been the same since he saved the second boy from a fire which consumed the second boys parents, and his drinking got out of control. You see the other boy portrayed as the stereotypical Indian who tells long stories, wears long braids and rhapsodises about eating the best fry bread in the world. These two boys grow up as friends reluctantly. When the first boy receives word that his long absent father has died somewhere in Arizona, he knows he must go there to retrieve the fathers belongings, but he nor his mother have the money to get there. So of course, the second boy offers to take the first boy if he will take him along. So they use the second boys money to take a bus from their home in Idaho/Eastern Washington to Arizona. Along the way they argue often (quite interesting scenes) and meet a few interesting characters. When they get to Arizona they meet the fathers neighbour woman and the boy sorts through the fathers things. The two boys set out to come home again in the fathers old truck, and they encounter trouble with a drunk driver along the way and end up being questioned by the police. AND WHO DO YOU THINK THAT POLICE MAN IS? The ubiquitous Tom Skerritt! NO! Wouldnt you think that Tom Skerritt, who seems to show up everywhere, would never show up here? I would have thought that. But no film is safe from the influence of Tom Skerritt, apparently.

Smoke Signals is significant because, with a Native American director, cast, screenwriter, it does an authentic job of dispelling conventional perceptions about Native Americans (VICTOR: You have to look like you just finished killing a buffalo.  THOMAS: But our tribe were fishermen.) Not having read the book this film was based on, I can't say anything about how well it adapts.  Apparently, the plot draws on several of the short stories in The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.  From a literary perspective, I found the repeated motifs of fire, disappearing and invisibility, magic, and basketball very fascinating (particularly when Arnold and Victor Joseph played basketball against the Jesuits).

  This is a story about how foolish  actions and angry attitudes can harm us and those we love.  It tells about  how acceptance of the weaknesses within human beings can help us to forgive  them and bring us peace.  Learning to love an ordinary human being, despite  deep pain and disappointment, brings inner freedom.
  The character of  Thomas, who suffered just as terrible a loss as Victor, demonstrated a calm  and peaceful spiritual maturity.  The stories he told may have been a  stretch, but the love that was in them was insight.
  Why would anyone  think that grieving or death should be cinematic or unique?  The ending  scene shows Victor finding the love that was hiding behind his pain and  rage.

After all, most of the  reviews on Amazon.com tend to be positive, since the people who visit any  given listing are usually people who enjoyed the film, music, book, etc.  I'm a fan of Sherman Alexie's writing, which I find fresh, unique, totally  engaging and entertaing.  I had eagerly anticipated the release of Smoke  Signals when I had heard Alexie was writing the screenplay.  I left the  theater on opening day very dissapointed.
Part of the problem was of  course that it was an adaptation of stories that I was already quite fond  of.  I didn't appreciate the attempt to make Thomas Builds the Fire so  cutesy, when I had envisioned him as quirky and strange (in a good way).  I  can still hear the girls sitting behind me going ""awwww""  everytime he said anything.  I like to think of Thomas as a guy most people  wouldn't get, but the character in the movie seemed clearly designed to  create the above response.  It also lacked the freshness of Alexie's  written voice.  Had it not had Native American characters, it would be  indistinguishable from hundreds of other ensemble type coming of age road  films.  My feeling was that this was essentially an attempt to make a  commerical film created by Native Americans.  I think that had Hollywood  ever the guts to make a movie that didn't feature whites or blacks as the  main characters and they decided to make a film with Native characters,  something not too disimilar from Smoke Signals would have been the  result.
That said, the film wasn't BAD.  But it wasn't great or  outstanding... unless you want to listen to every single one of the 86  reviews before mine :-)  Anyway, that's my opinion, and I hope Alexie's  next film project lives up to my expectations.",966384000,37,1857,4.747634069400631
993624,5,6305210101,"Smoke Signals, the first film primarily directed, produced, and staring Native Americans is a standout.  The film is a wonderful coming of age story that focuses on the friendship of two distinctly different young  Native American teenagers with vastly different views about the now  deceased father of one of the boys. This story is brilliantly played out  against their journey across the country to pick up the remains of the now  deceased father, who long ago left the reservation, for reasons that will  be revealed at the end of the film. Part coming of age movie, part heroes  quest the film is a must see for anyone who had a difficult relationship  with their father or anyone who has ever struggled with relationships and  personal identity.  The fact that the films serious message is portrayed in  such a gentle comedic fashion makes this film a must view!
Putting that  aside, the film manages to present glimpses into the lives of Native  Americans both on and off the reservation that most people have never  encountered.  This alone makes Smoke Signals an especially appropriate film  for teenagers and adults. It is that rare blend of entertainment that  manages to be life affirming and funny at the same time.
On another note:  fans of the television show Northern Exposure should watch for the numerous  cameos by members of the cast who make memorable guest appearances.",962064000,3,1391,4.918103448275862

That Arnold Joseph cut his hair and never grew it long again...  what was the extent of his mourning-for one night, one lifetime, or one  race or people? That Thomas Builds the Fire gave himself so innocently and  joyfully to the DNA of his ""fine example of oral tradition""?;  That Victor Joseph fought every day against the ghosts of his past that  were more powerful than the struggle of daily living? And to the reviewer  who criticized the play between Victor and Susie Song...  this was more  real, and more NON-Hollywood than you know.  Mature women recognize this as  a real tribute to the honesty of nurturing and caring. But I'm prejudiced.  This movie was recommended to me by my 22-yr-old son.

993627,5,6305210101,"One of the few, and well overdue films created and helmed by Native Americans, it is a simple story about ordinary people with extraordinary strength.
Upon finding out about the death of his estranged and  alcoholic father, Victor (Adam Beach), a serious and angry youth, ventures  to retrieve his father's ashes from a craggy and desolate hideaway the  Arizona desert. Alongside Victor is his friend and companion, Thomas (Adam  Evans), a quirky and intellectual storyteller-type, who lost both parents  in a fire twenty years before.  The journey takes place on a bus and it is  here that Thomas and Victor find out just how different they are. Victor is  always stone-faced and reserved; Thomas is the humor and wit that keeps the  voyage going even in its darkest moments. One of the unique things about  this situation is that Thomas seems to have known Victor's father better  than Victor himself. As the roadtrip progresses, Thomas delivers  uncomplicated but emotionally charged accounts of how his relationship with  Victor's father manifested itself when he was a boy. And the reasons why  the man Thomas knew as his surrogate parent suddenly left one day never to  be heard from again.
Thomas' mixture of distressing story threads,  interwoven with vignettes of whimsical humor paints a vivid picture for the  boy whose father disappeared in 1976. And for the first time, Victor is  able to drop his inhibited roughness, and earnestly respect his father for  what he was, and forgive him for the unanticipated departure.
This film  not only touches on the delicateness of family complexities, But it also  provides an insight into the oral tradition of Native American  storytelling.",959040000,2,1694,5.083636363636364
993628,4,6305210101,"Smoke Signals is thought to be about the Native American's lives.  I find this hard to believe, and just see this movie as a young man looking for the truth of his father.  Sure this storyline is about the two Native  Americans, but it is not hard to show how this same story could evolve in  any type of lifestyle, or race.  Overall, it is a great movie and shows how  a young man comes to terms with his life, his fathers life, and his best  friend.",956188800,2,451,4.114942528735632
993629,4,6305210101,"Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) tells stories.  Anyone who has ever had a father, or a father figure should listen.  Smoke Signals is a movie about the stories we tell, about growing up sane in an insane world, and  about learning to find the truth in the fiction we create for  ourselves.
Based on short stories from Sherman Alexie's brilliant  collection of wit, irony and tragic comedy, The Lone Ranger and Tonto  Fistfight in Heaven, this film shows a sure hand and a light touch.  Sherman Alexie knows how to write with irony, wit and subtle humor, and in  this screenplay he captures perfectly, as he does in his book, the angst  that is uniquely 20th century American Indian.  As our two protagonists  prepare leave the reservation to claim Victor's (Adam Beach) dead father's  truck, a woman who drives backward around the reservation all day in her  Chevy tells them to be careful.  When they tell her they're only going to  Arizona (they live on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in Washington State),  she replies, ""Unh . . . America, huh?  That's about as foreign as it  gets.""
It is that bemused sense of being an outsider in your own  land that drives this independent film and gives it a genuine feel, rather  than the typical over-romanticized ""Dances with Wolves"" version  of Indian-ness.  Victor, in fact, takes vicious delight in both  perpetuating and defying Indian stereotypes, as he leads a chorus of  ""John Wayne's Teeth"" and councils Thomas, who wears thick glasses  and his long hair in braids, to look more fierce, ""like you just got  back from killin' a buffalo or somthin.""
It is Beach's performance  which seems the most stilted and amateurish, unfortunately, as one of the  major characters.  But he almost makes it work for him by internalizing  Victor's anger and creating another mask, however thin.  Another problem is  the romance that almost develops between Victor and his dead father's  neighbor (Irene Bedard).  Perhaps it was a choice between staying with the  major theme of the movie and ""going Hollywood"" on both the  casting and the plot in this case.  There is real heat when the two are on  screen, but it goes nowhere.
These are two very minor irritations with  an otherwise delightful movie.  The universality of this coming of age  story, combined with its unique characters and point of view, make this a  video you're going to want to see again and again.  Buy it.",955756800,27,2416,4.818627450980392
993710,5,6305210101,"""Smoke Signals"" is that most refreshing of movie projects -- one that defies many of the Hollywood conventions, yet still conveys a story to which everyone can relate.
 Yes, the film (based on Native American  author Sherman Alexie's ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fight in  Heaven"")is told from a Native perspective. The first surprise?  It  does not rattle off an angry tirade against white domination (not that such  isn't understandable).  Instead, it pokes gentle fun at the ways in which  non-Indians stereotype tribal people, and often deny them a place in the  contemporary world. The jokes are funny, and while many are really  ""inside"" jokes that Native Americans will more fully appreciate,  they are still appealing to a wider audience.
 There are other surprises.  A scene that suggests the start of a violent confrontation forgoes the  ""Rambo"" outburst and instead gives us a contemplative and  somewhat ironic turn of events.  Another scene sets up the audience for  expecting  big trouble, only to pull the rug out and show a humorous  resolution.  Even so, this is a serious film in many ways.  It's about how  we remember a painful past, it's about finding ways to forgive even when we  don't fully understand the past.  It's about Native Americans... but also  about being human.  That's it's strong point -- it manages to humanize both  the Native American characters as well as people in general all in the same  stroke. This film will take on historical importance, for it goes a longer  way than any previous film in fostering understanding and acceptance of  First Nation people.
 Besides the compelling story, this film offers you  some marvelously ""quirky"" performances, unlike what Hollywood  customarily dishes out.  Thomas and Victor just become more and more  endearing as the film progresses, awkward mannerisms and all. I've  discussed this film with some First Nation people who absolutely love it,  and they tell me that I simply MUST read Alexie's books.  Good advice!",954806400,15,1999,5.055555555555555

I'm not a Native American, but for most of my life I lived  near the Fort Hall Indian reservation in Idaho.  The movie poignantly  reminded me of the struggles those on a reservation deal with, especially  alcoholism and family break-downs.  One critic (with whom I strongly  disagree) said ""Smoke Signals"" was too simplistic and  ""cute.""  How wrong -- I think most of life's profound moments  happen simply.

It  was exceptional in many ways--dialogue, message, execution.

993770,5,6305210101,"A friend of mine recommended this movie to me a while back.  Every time i went to the video store i would see it there, just waiting..........waiting for someone to notice it..........waiting for me to pick it up off the  shelf and rent it.  But intead i would just pass it by and look for  something more conventional, an ""easy-rent"" so to speak.  Something that i heard of, more like.  I had many opportunities to rent  ""Smoke Signals"" but it always seemed to get the back burner.  One  day, i rented ""American History X"" (which i placed myself on a  waiting list for) and was thrilled that i finally would get to see it!  I  wanted to picked one more movie for ""back-up"" so i could do the  whole ""double-feature thing"".  Can you guess which movie i chose?  If you guessed ""Smoke Signals"" you are correct.  To make a long  story short, the movie that i had been obsessing about (American History X)  turned out to be a very asanine, negative movie with alot of violence.  A  total dissapointment.  Smoke Signals however was such a sweet surprise.  This movie takes you to a beautiful part of the country we seldom see.  It  covers the lives of native American indians we also seldom see in the  movies.  Not only that, it is a positive depiction of the native American  culture and shows their affinity to nature, family and spirit.  The  characters in this film grow on you as the movie takes it's course,  characters with a lot of personality and depth, and whom you will remember.  I think that is so important in a film.  After the movie ended, it left me  with a good feeling, which is quite rare for a film to do nowadays.  This  is one of the best films i have seen in current release.  And there it was  the whole time........waiting patiently, totally understated and as i turns  out totally worth it. Forget all the negative, action packed, car crashing,  bombs exploding, cool guns and hot sex type movies.  Escape to a better  place, let your soul feel good again.
