8297541,4,B001EBTC94,"Wendy Craig is at the warm centre of this most delightful drama series, which follows the various posts of a nanny in the 1930's - Barbara Gray (Ms Craig - ""Butterflies"", ""And Mother Makes Three""), a childless divorcee, who has just emerged from a painful marriage.  The series is a low-key drama suitable for family audiences, but which grapples with some hard issues along the way.  In an era where the children of titled families were mostly looked upon as encumbrances and had to be ""seen but never heard"", Barbara is often faced with cold, indifferent parents who need just as much re-programming as their children do; and, almost like an earth-bound ""Mary Poppins"", Barbara charms her troubled charges and turns them into well-grounded, caring young people.

Series 1 of NANNY takes place in the early 1930's and kicks off with Barbara graduating from her training academy.  When I happily discovered that many of the episodes in this debut series were written by the husband-wife team of Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham (who also wrote several of the most enjoyable ""Upstairs Downstairs"" stories), I knew I was in good hands!  Settle down, perhaps with a cup of tea and a warm blanket, and let NANNY take you back to a simpler world.

Episodes:

""Innocent Party"" - Fresh from the training academy, Barbara goes to work for the Fitzpaine-Cheddon's, a notable political couple, whose young son Robin (Charles Langdale) is clearly in some state of mental distress.  Barbara urges Robin's aloof parents Sir Anthony and Lady Evelyn (played by Jeffrey Wickham and Georgina Melville) to take a more positive, encouraging role in his life, but has an uphill battle ahead of her.

""Now Look What You've Done"" - Barbara is engaged as nanny to the two children of Jack and Fin Persse (Niall Buggy and Fiona Victory), a pair of extremely friendly yet dirt-poor Irish aristocrats, who manage to get by in London thanks to the recognition that comes with their surname.

""Just Somebody Being Naughty"" - Barbara moves on to a challenging post as nanny to the six children of Frederick and Dorinda Sackville (Benjamin Whitrow and Patricia Hodge).  Whilst she naturally finds friction with oldest daughter Artemis (Annabelle Lanyon), Barbara's most actively destructive opponent in the Sackville household turns out to be a person she'd least expect...

""The Magic Island"" - During an extended visit from Mr Sackville's mother (Patience Collier), a battle of wills erupts between Barbara and the Sackville's stern schoolmistress Miss Sullivan (Sonia Graham), when it's announced that little Emerald (Anna Campbell) will leave the nursery and join her two elder sisters in the school-room; but who soon collapses under the severe psychological and physical strain of her cruel teacher.

""Trompe L'Oeil"" - Love unexpectedly blooms when Barbara strikes up a relationship with Captain Robert Charlesworth (Peter Jeffrey), an artist who has been hired by Mrs Sackville to redecorate the drawing room.  But when their relationship gets serious, Barbara is faced with a difficult choice about her future in the Sackville home.

""Goats and Tigers"" -  Barbara's early childhood in India comes in handy when she's assigned a post on the Suffolk Coast to supervise the two grandchildren of Mrs Nesbitt (Joan Hickson), who've recently returned from the British Raj.  However, Barbara is rattled by their peculiar behaviour, most notably 12-year-old James (Samuel West), who displays some rather alarming and violent masochistic tendencies.

""Waifs and Strays"" - Back in the heart of London, Barbara is employed by Lewis and Adela Quinn (Alan Dobie and Caroline Blakiston), a pair of socialists who have decided to take in a pair of slum children as an ""experiment"".  To her frustration, Barbara's efforts to give the boys an orderly, structured life are constantly at odds with the Quinn's free-spirited approach.

""A Birdless Cage"" - Barbara begins to question her future in the Quinn household when Adela, now blissfully pregnant with her first child, starts to take on a more active, motherly role with the two boys.

""A Pinch of Dragon's Blood"" - Now employed by Mrs Rudd (Anna Cropper) at her family's rambling mansion outside of Ipswich, Barbara is driven to the brink of exhaustion due to two small babies and an ever-growing roster of jobs - most of which don't involve the children.

""Other Peoples' Babies"" -  Finally crumbling under the strain of her job, Barbara is taken under-wing by the person she'd least expect - her ex-husband Archie (Donald Burton).  She must now make the difficult decision of whether to continue her career or give her marriage to Archie another chance.",1345248000,2,4673,5.094364351245085
