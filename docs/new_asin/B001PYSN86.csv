8334854,1,B001PYSN86,"DO NOT BUY ""MOSER BAER"" versions of this film. Moser Baer places tons of text ads DURING the movie to tell you to go to their website to buy more movies. it's just a huge scam and a complete ripoff, it'll ruin the experience for you, as it did for me and my family. Complete Garbage.

The movie itself is pretty good, I'd recommend the director's latest movie instead though. This felt a little lackluster, but it was kinda cool.",1476662400,,429,4.3625
8334855,3,B001PYSN86,"An okay little film, not much to it, and a cloudy plot-line.  Kind of the Thief of Bagdad meets Good Fellas. There's even a rip-off scene of the famous Joe Pesci tirade against Ray Liota, ""How am I funny?""

If you have nothing better to do, this is not bad. As Bollywood goes, it has very little pizzaz, and need some flash to spice it up, as in the girlfriend could have been a dancer with a heart of gold, and the sister could have been an educated but evil opponent, etc., etc.

And the guy steals the tackiest stuff that's supposed to be worth millions...tacky stuff....

He could have been a jewel or art thief---but see it!",1385510400,,629,4.305084745762712
8334856,4,B001PYSN86,"Charming, well made Indian comedy/drama based on the real life adventures
of a charming, wildly successful thief.

This owes more than a little debt to Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"" especially, crossing
the line from homage to rip-off at moments. Meanwhile, it lacks Scorsese's eye
for deeper pain and moral complexities.

None-the-less, this is well filmed, well acted, and ultimately kind of moving, while
revealing something of the Indian middle class to those of us half a world away.

But at times the broadness of the comedy just feels like its from a different film,
and that takes away from the film's effectiveness.

Very catchy score, and the last 5 minutes helps pull it all together and gives the
film something more.",1317168000,,722,5.042016806722689

8334858,5,B001PYSN86,"Great Movie. Over the top, tacky, and still extremely compelling story telling. Abhay Deol is a genius. I really like the acting of Archana Puran Singh also. Bollywood is evolving and this movie is a great example of superb talent in Bollywood",1272758400,,243,4.809523809523809
8334859,4,B001PYSN86,"Abhay Deol has emerged as one of the most understated actors and his choice of films bear testimony. This movie is about a thief in Delhi who enjoys stealing things from their houses. I enjoyed watching this film although I though it kind of fell apart in the second half. However watch it for the acting, if only.",1259971200,,314,4.431034482758621
8334860,4,B001PYSN86,"Story about a Love able Thief : Journey of an Ordinary Middle class Man to Petty Thief

(A) This movie is about a Lovable Thief who stole house hold stuffs like TV, VCR ,computers , Cars , gifts etc and was most wanted by Delhi Police .
(B) He was a down to earth thief who steals stuff without harming anyone .
(C) The Childhood of Lucky was captured very well  and its the best part in the movie

(D) Abhay Deol did a Fantastic Job .His acting was cool and he played the role in a natural way . Never looked like that he was acting in the film . Rest of the Actors were fine too

(E) I had lots of expectations with Paresh Rawal as he is senior actor in the industry.  He played triple role and still wasn't that powerful as Abhay .

This was the 1st film of Abhay Deol i liked.

I give this movie 4 Star . Fun and time pass movie . Worth watching the movie .",1250294400,,861,3.8857142857142857
