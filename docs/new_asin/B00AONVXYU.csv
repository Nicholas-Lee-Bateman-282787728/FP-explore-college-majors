8555455,2,B00AONVXYU,"I just got this DVD and luckily, I only paid 10 dollars for it because that it about all it is worth. First and most important, you NEED TO GO TO THE WEBSITE LISTED TO GET THE RECIPES! That being said, I was able to see various types of fish and how they prepared them in about one minute per recipe. I am not sure who gave this such a high rating but believe me, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF GOING TO ""YOU TUBE""  for techniques / and or recipes doing a Google  search for recipes. I might change my mind but when I think of what you can get for free from You Tube and the recipe details you can get from a Google search, this is not worth the money unless you want to go through it just to see what each type of fish looks like!",1373414400,,724,3.8523489932885906
