1352766,2,B00004TT5H,"I must admit that virtually as soon as I bought this DVD (out of curiousity because many other reviewers are in the ""gotta see them live"" camp) I wondered if I'd done the right thing;  when I played it I SO much wanted to justify my purchase but alas cannot;  there is energy, yes, but little variety - all musicians apart from Dave S are subordinate & the performances, to me, are formulaic;  I almost cut it off after the first 6 tracks but skipped forward to ""Walking on Broken Glass"" & ""There must be an Angel"" &, thankfully found some comfort in the familiarity of these & the (few) songs which followed.  Bottom line:  fine for true fans but not for the half-hearted.",1058140800,2,673,4.395161290322581
1352767,5,B00004TT5H,"this band was made for live performances. everything is in excellent form for this concert. dave's guitar playing rivals that of prince and annie's voice is full of emotion like NEVER before. by and large the best live performance i have ever seen. hearing them do ""here comes the rain again"" for the 5 billionth time could get old, but as soon as annie opens her mouth i'm hooked, and just as i'm loving it, it gets even better. she just sort of pauses mid chorus and the audience fills the gap and she gets this big smile like, yeah, you know where i'm coming from and then joins in with the thousands of people watching, and well, it's perfect. brings me to tears every time.
so if you're looking for some true performances you MUST pick up this concert, 'cause it will never get any better.",1047945600,,794,4.408163265306122
1352768,5,B00004TT5H,"This is one of the best DVDs in my collection.  Not only is the music great, but the DVD quality is amazing.  I thought I'd heard my home theater system really jam, but this DVD made me feel like I was experiencing 5.1 for the first time again.  Love Annie's live version of ""Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves"", but it's all fantastic.  Good special features, too.",1013212800,,366,4.417910447761194
1352769,5,B00004TT5H,I went to the PeaceTour Concert in Sydney and it is almost like being there with the high levels of sound quality that is on this DVD.  It has lots of great Acoustic numbers that are typical Dave and Annie. I hope Annie Lennox brings out a DVD of one of her solo concerts.,971308800,3,272,4.037037037037037
1352770,5,B00004TT5H,"There is no stopping the Eurythmics. In this fantastic 1 Hour and 36 minute video, they lash out almost every hit they had back in the 80's.  Annie's Voice, and Dave's guitar experience, makes them one of the  fantastic duo of the 80's. A must get for any Eurythmics fan.",967766400,2,271,4.4
1352771,5,B00004TT5H,"I never liked them all that much, but what a concert - a must for all music lovers!",964310400,3,83,3.6666666666666665
1352772,5,B00004TT5H,"How does she do it?  How exactly does Annie Lennox, a truly brilliant voaclist in all of her studio recordings, manage to regularly surpass herself in her live concert recordings?
I bought Annie's Central Park  concert on VHS once it became available in the US, and was blown away by  the way Annie, the consummate performer, cranked up the intensity of her  vocals for the crowd, and found myself wishing for the features that DVD  brings: clearer picture and sound, ability to easily slide back and review  nuances of performance and the ability to jump back and for the between  elements.
Luckily for us, the Peacetour DVD delivers, hands down.
First  off, the performance itself is spectacular - not just a live run-through of  the Peace album, but a retrospective of all the Eurythmics hits you'd want  from this ""reunion"" tour.
But beyond the magic of the concert,  this DVD truly delivers on the promise of the DVD format.  In addition to  the concert, the DVD includes  60-minute ""behind-the-concert""  documentary, which features additional performances of all of the  ""peace"" tracks.
The disk also includes comprehensive lyrics of  all of the songs, as well as a hyperlinked discography, which allows the  viewer to jusp directly to the performance of a song within the concert  from the album track listing.
Bottom line:  if you even kinda like the  Eurythmics, buy this DVD, and it'll make you a die-hard fan.  If you know  and love Annie but don't know the older Eurythmics stuff so well, fear not;  this DVD brings you enough energy, excitement and great performnces to  bring you up to speed.
If you don't know 'em at all; you should STILL by  this DVD - it's great music, performed and presented extraordinarily well.",963619200,16,1732,4.845890410958904
1352773,5,B00004TT5H,"I am a huge Annie Lennox fan;  her voice is just unbeatable.  I  pre-ordered this DVD the second I saw it announced;  I only wish they'd put  Annie's ""Live from Central Park"" on DVD!
This disc met my  expectations, and then some.  The menus are clean and cool, even containing  a complete discography with selected music clips. The concert it's self is  excellent, old and new Eurythmics tunes plus a few of Annie's own from  Diva.  There is also a documentary on the disc.
The encoding is  impecable, sharp and vibrant.  It was shot on video and processed through  'film look', which usually looks very fake, but it was well done and looks  natural.  (A couple of the songs have 2 extra camera angles you can toggle  between, and you can see that they _weren't_ processed through film look..  see if you can tell the difference!)
My only problem with this DVD is  that it's a dual layer disc, and there is a layer change right at the  beginning of chapter 5 during the concert.  If you have an unbuffered DVD  player, as do I, it winds up pausing for a second just as Dave begins his  guitar into.  It really stinks.  But I put the DVD into a Mac G4 with a DVD  player, and it plays through the layer change without pause, so if you  happen to run into this, no, your disc isn't defective.. your DVD player  just doesn't buffer through the layer change.  It makes me want to go out  and buy a new DVD player just ""fix"" this disc :)
Now like I  said if we can get ""Annie Lennox Live from Central Park"" on DVD,  and a new solo album, I'd be in heaven.",962323200,12,1550,4.2379310344827585
1352774,5,B00004TT5H,"This is one of the greatest live show on DVD. the sound is perfect(dolby-digital), the picture quality is very good, the show contains all the hits. must have!",961286400,8,159,4.714285714285714
1352775,4,B00004TT5H,"I bought this DVD because I really like most of the songs here.  Even better, they performed for Greenpeace, an organization I support.  What's not to like?",1382227200,,156,4.7407407407407405
1352776,4,B00004TT5H,"Beware of this DVD  it only played on one of my 3 DVD player. Good luck with this DVD. When it played, I enjoyed it.",1379980800,,116,3.64
1352777,5,B00004TT5H,Excellent concert and sound. Not at all dated as some people think. Shame not to have seen them live but the dvd makes up for it.,1324944000,,129,4.0
1352778,5,B00004TT5H,"The latest reunion of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart has produced an amazing concert with sheer artistry in both Annie's great voice, sense of drama, and Dave's music writing and guitar playing.  I mostly enjoyed how the songs were rewritten and presented in a new light which added new life to the ""oldies"".  You could see the effort put into the whole concert and Annie even nearly loses her voice a couple of times, but the vigor and passion she puts into each song are unsurpassable.  However, I got a tinge of sadness as I realized that this could be the last time they would be performing together as a duo in a live concert setting, and one has to admit, they have reached their 50's already.  Despite this, I will cherish this concert as one of the best they have ever given.",1277337600,,782,4.4475524475524475
1352779,4,B00004TT5H,"Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart reunite for ""PeaceTour,"" bringing their collective talents once again to their fans in a very enjoyable concert performance.  Annie has never failed to astonish me with her amazing vocal range.  Opening with the hard edge rock beat of their ""Peace"" cd's ""I Want It All,"" the duo moves through both their Eurythmics hits, as well as selections from Annie's solo releases.  Standouts include a rousing medley including- ""I Love You Like A Ball And Chain,"" ""Would I Lie To You?"" and ""Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves"" which showcases vocal talents from three of the back-up female singers.  Dave's skills on guitar are brought solidly to the forefront as he and Annie go into a nice acoustic session, (with a GreenPeace inspired backdrop of pine trees) featuring a lovely take on the duo's ""Here Comes The Rain Again"" and Annie's solo hit ""Why,"" which is followed by an enchanting take on ""The Miracle of Love.""

As the concert grows to a close the audience is informed that the proceeds from the ""PeaceTour"" concert will be donated to two environmentally conscience organizations, ""Amnesty"" and ""GreenPeace,""  This is followed with Annie sweetly pleading, ""please think about joining these worthwhile organization to make a difference,"" and then we're swept into a  performance of ""Peace"" (is just a word) and the concert is closed suitably with Eurythmics signature ""Sweet Dreams <are made of this>.""

Annie and Dave are outfitted in camouflage Army pants and shirts with bright silver, fur lined jackets and hoods! The entire band and back-up singers are also clad in Army camouflage clothing.  But the poor taste in costuming is forgotten when the music, and most of all, Annie's vocals kick in!  She could stand wearing rags and be dripping with mud, and her voice would still transcend the listener to overlook her attire.  All said, the Eurythmics's ""PeaceTour"" performance is an enjoyable experience and a very welcomed addition to any fan's dvd library!",1190246400,,1992,5.0426829268292686
1352780,4,B00004TT5H,"Very Good Live Concert..Excellent Picture,Excellent Sound. And the Camera Work is VG+.

Dave Stewart is getting some real nice Guitar Tone and he also plays some Sweet Slide Guitar on Missionary Man. Annie Lennox is having Fun from the Start and her Vocals Cook. She has a Great Presence on Stage and a Very Good Trio of Backup Singers. The Band Rocks with Dave and Annie.

This is a Very Good Concert to Watch and even just Listen to. They play like 21 songs here.

So if you are a Eurythmics Fan this is a Must Have DVD.If you have heard their songs but never bought any of their CD's then this is an EXCELLENT LIVE MUSIC ANTHOLOGY for you.

1352782,5,B00004TT5H,"I've read other reviews posted here and what I think they have all failed to touch on is this: Live is the proof in the pudding! If you can listen to the stripped down to guitar versions of some of their most popular songs they render here like only they can, and NOT have chills listening to Annie break her heart up into pieces and vocalize it, then you are the one who placed the chill in her heart. Watch Dave look at her as she sings and pick up on when she is going to hold a note out and when she is not while backing her with nothing but a few strums of a guitar! THAT! Is the meaning of ART. Listening to the different arrangements they have come up with for some of their most popular songs is reason enough to buy this DVD.",1077926400,11,734,4.0

1352784,5,B00004TT5H,"This DVD is brilliant.  The concert is spectacular, and surpasses even the superior level of live performance that Eurythmics fans are used too.  It is well presented and the sound is incredible.  The raw emotion of the band explodes out of your television.
But the DVD not only shines for the concert, the presentation is also spectacular.  The menus, extras, and ""peacetalk"", are all amazing.  The PeaceTalk, is an hour long documentary about the Peace album, Annie and Dave's history, the causes, and footage of the incredible songs on the Peace album.
This DVD is perfect, it surpasses all expectation and the whole package is just absolutely perfect.",1066608000,3,655,5.027777777777778

7923093,2,B00004TT5H,"As another reviewer noted, I have had a very difficult time finding something that will play this disc. 2 Blu-ray players said Unreadable Format {or maybe it was Unrecognized Format), while I out of 2 standard DVD players did play it, as did my PC. Unfortunately, the things that play it are not part of my best surround sound system, limiting my listening pleasure, unless I go to great lengths to rearrange what's where. Otherwise I can only play this where the sound is inferior and in stereo only. Many folks, I am sure, would not consider this a big deal, but I do, and I'm on the fence as to what action to take, if any. Maybe I should just accept the limitations and make the best of the situation. As for content, I'll have to get back to you when I 've actually watched and heard it in my limited circumstances.
