2817564,1,B000PEKX62,"For those with hearing impairment, beware that none of the Stratford Collection releases have subtitles or closed-captioning. This is a serious omission that prohibits me from buying these DVDs.",1376265600,8,194,5.724137931034483
2817565,3,B000PEKX62,"This 1989 Stratford(Ontario)festival production(taped by the CBC)of Shakespeare's Comedy Of Errors has a solid cast of Canadian actors,once more taking to the stage for our enjoyment. This very abridged version(most of the Bard's presentations,especially on film,VERY unfortunately,are abridged),comes to us in a kind of musical version. The interludes between scenes have incidental music mostly sung by the actors either on stage or off. There are even moments of dancing thrown in for good measure. Also bothersome are inter titles on screen,which tell us whose home we are at,who is on screen or where in town we are. Shakey's plays TELL us all these things,there was/is no need for someone to walk across the stage with a sign giving us an obvious visual cue. Shakey would be turning over in his grave at that faux paux. While,in this case,it seemed a good fit,I prefer my Shakespeare delivered straight up with no chaser. This production treated us slightly like little children,which I didn't like.
The plot involves a father who is parted from his wife and his twin sons,who each have a twin servant,after a ship's sinking. He searches for his family for roughly five years and ends up where the play begins at Ephesus. Being Syracusian he is arrested and brought before a magistrate who hears his tale of woe(all those from Syracuse must pay a hefty fine or face execution).Instead of instantly executing him for the lack of a thousand ducats,he allows him time to gather the sum. Meanwhile in town,one son is married and resides there,while the other coincidentally arrives in town,just passing through. From here the mix ups pile one on top of the other throughout the play,making for lots of laughs. In the end there is a gigantic reunion as the entire mess is finally resolved and all live happily ever after.
Shakey was a genius at comedy writing(either writing all out comedies like this or interjecting comedy into some of his more serious works)and this is one of his better works. But this quite abridged version(barely 76 minutes)might serve better as a good primer for school students and others not familiar with Shakey's works;whereas Shakey vets like myself will find it quite lacking;little meat on the bones,as it were.
Technically there are no extras,but the picture here is much better than in The Tempest I recently reviewed. The master video tape seems to be in better shape,with not so much degradation.
All in all a fancied up and shortened version of A Comedy of Errors. Solid acting and performances,but with a musical twist.",1347148800,9,2558,4.992974238875878
2817566,5,B000PEKX62,"I have a hard time with a lot of Shakespearean productions.  I have seen different versions of The Comedy of Errors and this is really the best.  They obviously place it in the late 18th century, and that is not important.  The cast is brilliant, the director knew his stuff.  He made us laugh, which is exactly what Shakespeare was trying to do when he wrote it.  Not everyone can accomplish that.  Yes, the same actors play the lead roles of the twins, but since they are identical twins that should be the case, I wasn't confused and I saw it for the first time when I was only 13 or 14.  I loved it then, and I was not a Shakespeare fan.  Other versions are boring, slow and I swear the actors have no idea what they are talking about.  A good director gets us to understand what is being said and makes it seem natural that the actors would say it too.  Well done!",1318291200,13,869,4.180722891566265
2817567,4,B000PEKX62,"Highly enjoyable, but the use of the same actors to play the Antipholi and the Dromios gets confusing; part of the fun of watching the show live is having two actors play the Antipholi and two play the Dromios so you don't get confused as an audience member.

Still, this production is pretty good.  The costumes and music are exceptional (I find myself humming the ""Doo dooodle doo dooo"" during my day sometimes) and this is a good addition to the Stratford videos I already own.",1190851200,14,480,4.569767441860465

8190894,5,B000PEKX62,Bought this for my son who was reading this in school.  Perfect to pair with the book and helped him to understand and keep his grades up.  We watched it as a family which made it more fun.,1495756800,,189,3.9473684210526314
8190895,4,B000PEKX62,"What a giant we have in Will Shakespeare that after 400 years we can still laugh at his jokes.  This makes I Love Lucy seem tame.  This version has a cast of professional players doing justice to the original.  Watch, relax, don't over think it folks, this is a romp, a farce an absurd comic triumph.",1481587200,2,300,4.321428571428571
8190896,5,B000PEKX62,"I used this in a teaching unit. It worked beautifully.  It is well acted, well produced and very easy to use in the classroom.  Would recommend.",1437264000,,144,4.5
8190897,4,B000PEKX62,"Last night, I watched two versions of William Shakespeare's shortest play, A Comedy of Errors, one the old BBC version with Roger Daltrey, the other this new DVD from the Canadian Stratford Theater. Neither was entirely satisfactory. Watching the BBC version reminded me of why I found so many of those plays unsatisfactory, even when the acting was excellent. They apparently used every single line Shakespeare wrote, including jokes that don't make sense unless you're an Elizabethan. The result is that the delivery is often so rushed you can't understand a word, and get the impression that the director is looking at a stopwatch. Second, the BBC director has no sense of comic timing. A Comedy of Errors is a very funny play, but I didn't laugh once, even though Roger Daltrey was charming. I did laugh a lot at the Canadian Stratford version, which only lasts 76 minutes. But I got the impression that everybody was trying too hard, and overacting shamelessly. The BBC version is out of print in the US but available from amazon.co.uk.  There is a third version, which I ordered from amazon.co.uk, starring Judy Dench. I'll review it when it arrives.",1433808000,,1156,4.8979591836734695
8190898,3,B000PEKX62,very good.,1423958400,,10,4.5
8190899,5,B000PEKX62,"This production is faithful to the text (mainly), but with enough additional staging elements to make the humor clear to a modern audience. The costuming is not true to either the Elizabethan practice of using Elizabethan garb regardless of the time/place setting or to a modernized equivalent, but it is fine for conveying ""old.""  The theme music recurs frequently--be prepared to be humming it for a long time.",1423008000,,412,5.0588235294117645
8190900,5,B000PEKX62,"We all have our predilictions. Regarding Shakespear I lean to originalism. I'm getting each and every play, and like you have seen the hits many more than one time. Down to  only three or four I haven't got now and I watched this one this week since the price was right on Amazon. I laughed out loud thruout the performance. Sure it wasn't an intellectual or translational prioblem as some of the productions of little performed plays are. You can easily keep track of which twins are which! I think it translated in a modern performance what the Elizabethian performance may have done for its own audience. And it's certainly not an adaptation, it's true to Shakespear. One of the best I've seen and very recommended to young and college type folks. If you don't have this play on DVD, buy this one.",1411689600,5,800,4.594405594405594
8190901,2,B000PEKX62,"While the costuming is the main concern of this review's title, and by far the first noticeable point of confusion, the acting in this play is rather scattered. A few of the main characters are able to preform well enough, but the Dromios and the Antipholi get confusing - especially as they are played by the same actors. As a stage play, this may have been fun to see live, but the recording has a few audio issues, and there are more than a few moments where the laughter of the audience seems forced, which detracts from the all-around viewing experience. While I got this version to help me write a paper concerning the different productions and production decisions made for the play historically, and I therefore watched it with a more critical eye than I would have otherwise, I doubt I would have watched it full through without the threat of the paper looming above me.

Overall, the play itself is funny, but this production is funny in another way: it's probably far past its expiration date.",1399075200,4,1004,4.640449438202247
8190902,5,B000PEKX62,"Never a dull moment. Incredible conception. Loved just about everything. Energy spills out over everything. Songs, dancing, revolving and descending sets. All this and yet true to the play both in letter and spirit.",1378339200,,215,5.352941176470588
