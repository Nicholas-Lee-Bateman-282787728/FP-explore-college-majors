8560622,1,B00ARWX51C,"As a customer  wrote before, cover says 110 minutes and unrated, in fact it runs only 72 mins and is totally rated. Also the complete nice music is missing. Don't buy this, it's not worth to spend Money for it. I have a VHS-recording from german TV and this is 108 min (without end credits). So the film should be in complete length. I just thought to buy the original to get better picture Quality :(
Perhaps a mistake in the pressing factory, because this DVD came sealed to me.",1498608000,,480,4.333333333333333
