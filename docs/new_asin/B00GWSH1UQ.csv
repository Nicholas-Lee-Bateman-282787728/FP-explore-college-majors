6120906,2,B00GWSH1UQ,"Pathetic, even for Kane Richmond. One minute the hero is escaping from a submarine (which appears to be in a swimming pool). Immediately, he is half way around the world saving a bomb sight from a crashed plane. He radios the Admiral who is his boss on shortwave so the enemy can listen in. He tells the Admiral no plane can land so the enemy fly in using what looks like a spaceship from Buck Rogers. etc. etc.

When the silverlight movie player crashed this dog was not worth resuming. Even for something supposedly based on a comic book this is lame. Why anyone bothered to make this serial into a movie is beyond me.",1435017600,,620,4.391304347826087
6120907,4,B00GWSH1UQ,I happen the think that Spy Smasher is one of the finest serials ever made and this 100 minute condensation for feature film length does an adequate job of bringing the key story and dramatic/action elements together.  The serial is still superior but the feature version is fine for an evenings viewing in the limited time frame.,1433980800,,330,4.7894736842105265
6120908,5,B00GWSH1UQ,If you grew up watching these serials at the saturday afternoon matinee then this will take you back in time - I have a collection of over 100 of these serials and I watch them over and over - LOVE EM and this is one of the best-ot-the-BEST - Recommended by SBJ,1424044800,,261,4.038461538461538

6120910,4,B00GWSH1UQ,"This was edited into a movie from a serial, however, the editing was done well and you hardly notice. Of course, that means the inevitable cliffhangers lose much of their impact as you immediately see how the hero escapes. Nonetheless, the original serial must have been one of the better ones. Some of the action is quite convincing and, in some cases, looks genuinely dangerous. I read that Kane Richmond did many of his own stunts.

Other attractions are some decent submarine and airplane models sequences and the fabulously bulbous ""batplane"" with its gyroed ability to land in tight spots. Even in 1942, when the original serial was made, it was apparently thought that the Nazis were ahead in aviation technology. I wondered if this craft was one of the inspirations for the flying wing thing in Raiders of the Lost Ark. There is also a ray gun, that is given a more than was usual at this time credibility when explained how it might work.

It must be said that there is little point in viewing something like this and comparing it to the wire-worked CGI action films of today. These are best enjoyed in the context of when they were made, and this one will still hold up well for casual light viewing, at least for those who enjoy this kind of thing

One caveat: on our Wii with a 28 Mbps average download speed, this stopped and started for the whole film at least once a minute. As I was only watching 5 or 10 minutes at a time  over a span of days during my morning coffee, I stayed with it. This has also been true with many other of, perhaps we could say, the less apt to be watched attractions on Amazon Prime. Other films stop and start every few seconds and are unwatchable. Perhaps our aging Wii is not up to it, or perhaps it is Comcast. Yet, as many other films stream fine, it would indicate that the problem lies at the source, i.e. with Amazon. Anyone know what is going on here?",1410480000,2,1902,4.425714285714286

6120913,3,B00GWSH1UQ,"""Spy Smasher"" from 1942 is regarded as one of the best serials from Republic Pictures, with good stunt work and well-choreographed fight scenes, directed by William Witney with plenty of action supported by a superb musical score under the direction of Mort Glickman.  The plot moves in a logical fashion and the situations seem believable, acting quite good by serial movie standards, and there is a seriousness of purpose common to Republic's wartime serials.

Unfortunately, the only ""official"" release was the videotape first issued in 1984 by NTA, later known as Republic Pictures Home Video.  The two DVD-R editions listed by Amazon appear to have been sourced from that commercial video, likely one upgraded from the original 1984 release, and while the transfers are generally competent, neither is really as good as it could be.

The single DVD-R edition from ATI, available through Hodgepodge, isn't as bad as might be feared from cramming the whole serial on a single-layer disc, but some digital artifacts are obvious with a limited number of intensity levels causing some ""grain"" in the darker areas, and some spurious colors.  I detailed its faults and virtues in a review linked to that product under ASIN: B00DSQIWEE.

I admit to having a bias in favor of Bill Black's offerings through AC Comics, which are promptly shipped with good packaging.  They are supplied with the two discs in a single paper sleeve inside the DVD case to avoid the damage that often happens when discs fall off the hubs during shipment.  And while most of the serials from AC Comics are copied from commercial video editions, transfer quality is usually quite good.  This one isn't the best of them.  It is on two single-layer DVD-R's, the case identifying it as being from ""Fast Fusion Films,"" and it is duplicated in the normal ""2-hour"" mode which should result in better picture quality than the ATI release, but unfortunately there are some other problems.  The ""Editorial Review"" notes it ""is now re-mastered for better quality"" and the copy I received has October, 2013 dates on the files in the TS_VIDEO directories.  The sharpness isn't quite as good as the ATI transfer, noticed mostly in the small print during the credits and not much of an issue otherwise.  But despite having twice the available disc space, excessive compression was still used somewhere during the transfer, again the main issue being a limited number of intensity levels, and while usually with less effect than in the ATI release, and no spurious colors appear, there is still some ""digital grain"" in the dimmer areas of the picture such as the background of the credits or in the view of the descending elevator in the Chapter Five cliffhanger.  The image has been enlarged slightly to hide the head-switch glitch from the videotape, and in a couple chapters the bottom of the intro text is clipped.  But there are two more-annoying factors unrelated to the digital aspects of the transfer.  The worse of these is a slight roughness in the action, a speed glitch about once per second noticed especially when things move across the screen at moderate speed, such as automobiles arriving and leaving Admiral Corby's residence, airplanes in long shots flying across the sky and especially the team of horses pulling the wagon in Chapter Two, who seem to be operating on only three legs.  This effect also makes the fight scenes a little ""jumpy.""  The other thing noticed is interference between horizontal scanning lines and patterns in the image such as venetian blinds and tile roofs, a common video problem but worse here than in the other editions.  These two issues suggest the source was a PAL-format videotape, and the conversion was not done in an optimal manner.  Neither effect is extreme, but they are not present in the NTSC videotape edition.  The sound is good and loud, and fairly crisp, though still with the faults present in the source from Republic.  These defects do not make the serial ""unwatchable"" and the edition has two ""extras,"" a set of ""photos"" including lobby cards and still images, and a ""stunt reel"" in honor of David Sharp, with many of the action scenes from the serial spliced together.

So the choice comes down to which defects are more troubling; either DVD is very ""watchable,"" the serial is an absolute joy, at least when watched with a day or so between chapters to recover from all that action, but an official video release would be preferable.",1402704000,12,4462,4.912117177097204
