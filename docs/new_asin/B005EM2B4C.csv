I just got the DVDs today. Besides the bluray, I have a 2.1gb .mkv file of the First Japan Tour that has better video quality than these DVDs. I think it must be the original cameras that were used. The close up shots are good, but some of the medium and longe range shots are not very sharp here, whereas with the First Japan Tour all the shots are awesome.

*** Awesome Update Nov 17: They are coming out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2011-Girls-Generation-Tour/dp/B00A7R7T78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2011 Girls Generation Tour</a>&nbsp;on December 4th 2012 (though Amazon says they'll have it on the 11th).

*** Update Oct 9: Now that I've had a chance to watch all of this, I love this concert. Each of the 9 girls has a solo (sometimes with members of other groups) and being early in their career they do a lot of covers. Many of the covers are songs I would otherwise never listen to but I love watching these girls sing them.

The biggest standouts for me were the song Chocolate Love and Seohyuns' solos (and Yuri's diary, and Sooyoung towards the end of Iceboy).

I still think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japan-First-Tour-Blu-ray/dp/B0067MWRG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japan First Tour [Blu-ray</a>] is their better concert video, but I really like this one as well (and this one costs a lot less).
I cannot wait for their third concert video.

The quality of the video is excellent and the camera work does a very good job of capturing the energy of the girls and the crowd.

8468665,2,B005EM2B4C,"I am a huge Girls' Generation fan. If I can afford it, I purchase any memorabilia of SNSD I can get my hands on: sticker books, albums, postcard sets, DVD/Blu-rays, etc. While I am a very loyal SONE, I do have an objective point of view when reviewing all their products. As a fan I expect to have paid for a quality product that entertains me. Unfortunately when it comes to the 1st Asia Tour concert, I am quite disappointed. As its title suggests, this is the first Girls' Generation tour in Asia and the first to be released for home video. I can cut the girls some slack on their performances since this is their first major concert after their debut. But believe me, their performances are the least of my criticisms on this concert.

I want to start by reviewing the packaging of this DVD. It is excellent. There is a slip cover that goes over the main case holding the DVDs. Both the slip cover and case are very good quality. The slip cover is transparent and comes on and off without issue. The main case is folded and opens to each side like a book holding disc 1 to the left and Disc 2 to the right. Speaking of a book, there is a photo book in the center of the main case, right behind the girls' photo cut out. The photo book tucks into its spot nicely and you do not have to worry about it coming loose. The photos in the book are fantastic and the paper is of the highest quality. You get some staff credits in the back of the book as well if you are into that sort of thing.

Before I critique the concert, I want to explain about the menu on each disc. Pop one of the discs into your DVD player and you will see the SM signature appear on the screen followed by the menu. You are first asked in what language you wish to display the menu: Korean, Japanese, Chinese. Wish there was English but I cannot hold that against them (this concert was recorded before their popularity boomed overseas which would be a year after this event). In the menu you have the choice of starting the concert, scene selection, options, and bonus material (disc 2 only). In the options you can select to have the audio in surround sound or select to have subtitles (sorry, no English again).

Now we come to the actual concert. I am going to critique by the content on each disc.

DISC 1

The first thing I saw on my screen is a wide shot of a city. This is the opening video which introduces the girls as ""reverse gargoyles"" who turn from stone to angels when sunlight hits them. Not a bad opening. I really liked the music they played which set an ""epic arrival"" mood. When the opening video ended and the cameras showed the concert arena, I was confused. I could not tell if I watching a K-pop concert or an independent wrestling event. Let me explain what I mean by this. I understand that this is a DVD and not a Blu-ray so the quality is not going to be superb. I played the DVD in my PS3 and the resolution on the screen was very clear. The issue is the cameras used to record the concert. They are below average cameras that should not be used when recording one of the flagship pop groups of South Korea. Furthermore, the quality is not what you would expect of South Korea's most profitable music label company, SM Entertainment. Fortunately, there are segments in this concert that use better cameras but not nearly enough of them.

Camera quality aside, the concert starts off with a bang. The first few performances are great and the girls look amazing. The crowd is very lively and the energy in the arena is electric. They picked a great night to record this DVD as the girls played off the energy in the crowd on multiple occasions. Then came the member introductions. Jessica's intro music was an odd selection but not enough for me to shake my head. The same cannot be said for Hyoyeon's intro music. So let me get this straight, the lead dancer of your group gets a bizarre carnival juggling theme??? A song more appropriate  to her talent would have been the right way to go. One can argue she got to showcase her talent later in the show but I still found this to be a real poor decision for her intro music. Luckily the other girls have good intro themes and the leader, Taeyeon, has a truly charismatic introduction.

After the introduction we get a few more good performances, but when the girls break off into solo performances, the concert begins to lose some steam. I understand and respect that the girls need a break during this nearly three hour concert, but some of the songs felt tacked on as filler and took away from the momentum the girls started with at the beginning. This lack of momentum carries over into disc 2, but I will get to more details about that in a moment. I first want to mention that one of the great strengths of the concert are the interlude videos that take place every now and then between performances. There are some that are touching and some downright hilarious. My particular favorite is the diary interlude here on disc 1. It will entertain you, make you laugh, and love the girls even more. Disc 1 ends with mostly ballad songs and a few upbeat ones but nothing spectacular.

DISC 2

Disc 2 begins with more solo performances. While I do enjoy a few of these performances (Santa Baby and Sixteen Going on Seventeen are great), I felt that they were not the proper use of that slotted segment. A compromise I would have accepted was if the girls did not do cover songs but instead performed concert-exclusive songs not found on their albums. I would also have loved to see an original song pairing some of the members together where one or two play an instrument while the other sings. Just an example: maybe have Seohyun play the guitar or piano while Yoona sings. I felt this would have led to some interesting on-stage interplay between members. We get some interplay moments in the later half of disc 2, but this is when the girls are giving a speech. There is a huge difference between speech banter and performance banter. It also becomes apparent by this point that the producer/booker of the event did not give much thought to the pacing of the show. Some of the songs, particularly the hits, should have been placed in different spots to achieve their maximum effect. After the solo performances end, we get an interlude video with the song Beautiful Girls by Yoo Yong Jin. This is an excellent video package with an amazing song. It grabbed my attention but it was not enough to salvage the concert.

As everyone is familiar with, most concerts have that false finish where the audience begs the performer(s) to come back and the performer(s) eventually return with an encore. One problem though, the pacing of this concert was severely lacking by this point. Whoever was booking this concert at the time did not think one encore was enough so they did two. TWO?! By the second encore I, and poor Jessica fatigued with sweat, have had about as much as we could take of this poorly paced event. Well, Jessica got a paycheck for it and I did not so no argument there. All jokes aside, this concert really needed modestly paced segments which would have been perfect during the already booked solo slots. I can see why a lot of people may have liked it, and I respect that, but I really wanted a quality concert and this did not deliver. Kudos to the crowd in attendance though, they were into it all the way.

The bonus features on this DVD are two performances: one which was cut from the main featured concert, the other an alternate version of Barbie Girl by Jessica featuring Heechul of Super Junior. They are decent, but you can tell why they were not included when you watch them. There is also a making of feature which is worth your time. It is not that comprehensive as you only see the girls in regular clothes practicing on the stage and interacting with one another. It is only about 45 minutes but it gives you some insight into the production of the concert. Subtitles are available here as well (no, English is not). Even if there is not a subtitle that accommodates you, the interactions and practices need very little translation. There are some humorous parts as well which any SONE will enjoy.

FINAL THOUGHTS

I should note there are some audio issues on this concert DVD as well. During some performances the audience noise cuts out completely. Fortunately, this happens very little. I enjoy the authenticity of crowd noise during a recorded concert and it takes me out of the moment when it disappears. Some will not find this to be an issue but it is bothersome to me. I am going to use the 10 point scale for an overall score, and I would overall give this show 3.5/10. My Amazon rating of two stars is for the concert, bonus content, and product packaging. I would only recommend this DVD set for die hard Girls' Generation fans. If you are a casual Girls' Generation fan or general K-pop fan, you will want to stay away from this one.",1418428800,,8928,4.449266503667482
