4713409,1,B005JZBPFU,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine, although i wanted to watch it as well. From the description of the movie i thought it would be entertaining and funny. Well the movie was pretty cheesy to say the least. The special effects were not good at all, the plot was thin (what can you expect from a gay vampire movie?). There was one hot scene in the movie. Other than that it was just not something i would want to watch again. Have a bunch of friends over for drinks and watch it, that would be entertaining!",1325808000,4,528,4.186274509803922
4713410,3,B005JZBPFU,"Bite Marks is a horror-comedy with a twist: two of the main characters are a gay couple and the other one is confused. All of them are hot. Well, at least I thought so. Bite Marks is just slightly above average. It's one of those movies that is too light to work as horror and too dark and never outright hilarious to work as a comedy. It works best as a gay drama, actually. The scenes where one of the gay guys is trying to seduce the confused guy are hot and really got my motor running. I'd slightly recommend Bite Marks for those looking for a different kind of vampire movie, and it's certainly better than the awful Vampire Boys, another gay-themed vampire movie.",1322179200,15,670,4.368

4713430,2,B005JZBPFU,"**There may be spoilers**

I am not one to comment on other people's opinions of movies, but I did notice that some people gave this movie four or more stars.  The only way that this movie deserves more than a tepid review is if you value good looks over acting, quality, and just about everything else.  Here are some notable points.

PLOT

I could scarcely detect one.  From what I could determine, you have a gay couple who hitchhike and are picked up by an in-the-closet truck driver.  From there, the film descends into stupidity.  The rest of the movie involved vampires, or something in their similitude, a couple that bickers consistently, and a dirty trucker trying to fight his pent-up desire for men.

ACTING

What's that?  To be fair, the trucker protagonist was decent in portraying a trashy, sullied individual who has some redeeming qualities.  The rest of the cast was hired for their looks.  I suppose the hope was that if we focused on how they looked, we'd forgive the onslaught of bad acting that assaults us.

EFFECTS

Blood that looks like colored syrup you can get from the store, facial disfigurations that looked like they were done by first-year makeup artists, special effects that I--having no special-effects experience--could do with my eyes clothes.

CONCLUSION

This movie was a discombobulation throughout and should have been put out of its misery 10 minutes into itself.  But instead, it decided to buck the fate of death and hang around like a zombie, annoying the snot out of everyone around, to the point of everyone wishing it would just die.",1444003200,2,1581,4.814126394052044
4713431,2,B005JZBPFU,"This movie is just ""ok"".  I watched it late one night when I couldn't sleep.
The opening credits are seriously the best part of it.  The animation is quirky cute and the music reminds me of Danny Elfman. Otherwise it is a typical straight to video (I hope anyway) low budget film.  The characters are stereotypical and the poor acting doesn't help.  The script tries to be witty but rarely succeeds.  And of course there are the typical gratuitous sex scenes some of which are man on man.  All in all I'm really glad this movie was free w/ Amazon prime couldn't imagine paying for it.",1443830400,,584,4.462264150943396
4713432,4,B005JZBPFU,"I would have given it just 3 stars for the movie itself, but having Stephen Geoffrey in it ( from the original Fright Night) just made my night. I thought it had an interesting take on the Vampires abilities and frankly found the actors to be interesting enough that I might just look for other things they are in.",1443398400,2,314,4.338983050847458
4713433,5,B005JZBPFU,"I LOVED this ridiculous film!  I thought the acting was pretty good.  I found the script to be funny. and actually laughed out loud a couple of times.

4713436,5,B005JZBPFU,"I LOVE this absurd 'gay' vampite flick - full of twisted cliches, interesting turns and enjoyable real people characters - of course haveing Benjamin Lutz, Windham Beacham and David Alanson in the film as eye candy doesn't hurt either!

4713437,1,B005JZBPFU,"For those of you who relish the unspeakable exhilaration of feeling let down, infuriated, indignant, sorely disappointed from having wasted time and money on some offbeat piece of cinematic stupidity -- especially after having watched a tantalizing, inflatedly positive trailer about it -- then I promise, without reservation, ""Bite Marks"" will serve your need most admirably.

While the opening animated credits were admittedly first-rate in terms of both their quirky artistry and ""promise of things to come,"" those of you cursed with an unyieldingly discriminating nature, requiring at least a modicum of quality production in a film, will doubtless wind up tossing ""Bite Marks"" into the nearest available trash can.

Uh, oh! In a last-minute qualm of conscience, I fear that David Alanson Bradberry's pretty little face compels me to award the film an extra quarter star. I should have quit while ahead.",1397779200,2,907,5.335664335664336

4713441,3,B005JZBPFU,"Bite Marks (2011).  Not rated. Running Time: One hour, 24 mins.
Directed and written by Mark Bessenger.

A Trucker (Lou Cass) arrives at work to begin another week on the road. At his diesel turck, he hears a noise. He opens the door and sees nothing in there. He walks inside to the back. Sudden;y, we hear him scream and blood is pouring out and onto the ground. An apple has bite marks in it.
  We are then treated to animated opening credits sequence.
  Brewster (Benjamin Lutz) is making love to Amber Lynn (Miranda Downey). Well, he is trying to. Brewster has a male problem.  He gets a cell phone call from Caplan (Jon Gale) who tells him his brother is late and he will be fired in 10 minutes if he doesn't show up. Better yet, he wants Brewster to take his brother's place and take a shipment to Topeka, Kansas. When Brewster arrives at the workplace, he doesn't find caplan, but there is blood everywhere. Brewster steps into the pool of blood where the previous trucker's was at. Now his shoe is bloody, but he is on the road anyway. Along the way, he picks up two gay hitchhikers, Vogel (David Alanson Bradberry) and  Cary (Windham Beachma).

4713442,1,B005JZBPFU,"So, you may think me as much if you're one of the many who raved about Bite Marks when I say that I could not believe and nor understand all the hype about this...flick. I refuse to refer to drudge as film, and that is what I got in this piece of carp which was critically hailed (by apparent smurfs) and disguised as art. Phewy!

The premise of the flick is two guys supposedly hiking across, town..country?? It wasn't really clear on that, or much else. The guys are lovers, although one of them doesn't seem very loving at all and this hike was meant to cement their relationship. Instead it only showed the flaws of their relationship. When one of the guys gets tired of walking they wave down an inept redneck truck driver who is so inane as to miss the very obvious evidence of the murder of the driver he took over from, played by Stephan Geofries of the original Fright Night fame, now old and bloated but still sounding the same. The three men play at commentary dialogue along their trip which tries too hard to be either funny or interesting, and failing at both. When they reach a rest stop the two supposed lovers go off to a bathroom to do what men will and their badly acted love play is witnessed by the hick driver, whom after being totally straight for... however many years, suddenly finds himself looking at the dark-haired cheating boyfriend with renewed interest. Later, back on the road to drop off what is suppose to be a load of coffins to a funeral home, the hick and the cheater share a moment of lust, in the truck, beside the cheating bastards sleeping boyfriend! Whatever, hooray for Hollywood. They get run off the road, end up at dump where all the action is played out as vampire(s) begin to appear, chasing them around the truck which the three are stuck inside of with only the pages of the Bible, a plastic jesus and blessed piss to shield them from certain death. All of this done so in badly acted deadpan humor.

If that sounds good to you then by all means, buy/rent this crap and rave to your friends about it. Otherwise, find something truly good to watch.",1376697600,3,2098,4.432642487046632

4713446,1,B005JZBPFU,"The acting was bad, especially those of the supporting characters.  The actors weren't helped by some awful dialog.

He needs to be cast in more films.",1329696000,11,449,4.487804878048781
4713448,5,B005JZBPFU,I thought it was campy and truly funny in the vain of a spoof type of horror flic. Did it win awards at any of the festivals?,1328918400,,125,3.6666666666666665
4713449,2,B005JZBPFU,"Weak story, Characters were not interesting or engaging and Vampire rules were silly. Also tired of the Gay=slutty and incapable of an adult relationship. Can't we do better?",1328659200,2,174,5.25
4713450,4,B005JZBPFU,"Cary has professed his love to gay party boy Vogel, but the best he can get out of his lover is a ""Me, too.""  They are on an extended country hike, hopefully to strengthen their relationship, but decide to hitch a ride with Brewster, a good 'ol boy trucker hauling some caskets to a funeral home. (Cue spooky music.) Their trip ends with mechanical problems, broken down in a scrap metal yard in the middle of nowhere.  Night falls, and the vampires come out!  Oh, my.

I'll admit being a big fan of really cheesy horror films, and this is actually better than most of that genre I have seen, with an impressive animated title sequence, capable acting and photography, great music, and - most of all - a script that doesn't take itself too seriously.  With their knowledge of vampires a contradicting mess based on various movies they have seen, the boys plot with Brewster to survive the night, and hope that help comes with the dawn. It's a cute approach, kind of like a gay ""An American Werewolf in London.""  Not rated, but would be an R for violence and simulated sex; DVD promises many extras, including interviews, a behind the scenes, and a gag reel.  I give it four stars out of five.",1327795200,14,1192,4.4907407407407405

As with a few of the other reviews, I too found the acting a bit weak at times with some of the supporting cast; it wasn't quite campy, it was just a tad overly dramatic. I did love David Alanson Bradberry, he's Hot, his comedic timing was usually spot on and he just seems a natural in front of the camera.

An awful film with wooden actors uttering stupid dialogue.  The minimal chance that this film's horror plot would actually take flight fails within the first five minutes, though the foreshadowing promised something that might scare the hell out of you.  That this cowplop won any ""awards"" sadly shows what some critics find cutting edge these days.
