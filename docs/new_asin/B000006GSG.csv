7904299,5,B000006GSG,"This is one of the best 80's comedy/romance films that I have ever seen. This movie has everything. Great music, excitement, action, and suspense. Mary Beth Evans does a fantastic job as ""Piper"" in this film, and is still fantasic today as Kayla Brady on Days Of Our Lives. It's great to see her in a beginning role like this. Greg Bradford, who played Piper's boyfriend, as ""Rick Johnson"" was awesome as well. Together they both had a great chemistry in this film. Bottom line is, if you are looking for a great 80's romantic comedy, then look no further. This is the one you need to get. Outstanding! This DVD is a little pricey still, so you may want to wait for a good deal. I did and got mine new for $4.98 shipped.",1350691200,2,720,4.340740740740741

Lovelines, a 1984 teen romantic comedy musical is a FUN movie. This movie has everything that you would expect in a movie of this sort. It has action, comedy, romance(i.e. a forbidden love affair a la Romeo and Juliet) and music. It's chock full of music. It also has non-stop rivalries and party scenes.

The whole movie is about an upcoming battle of the bands competition between two rival high schools. One, an all girl pop group. The other, an all guy rock group. When the lead singers of both bands, named Piper and Rick, meet and fall in love, that is when the comedy and the action really begins. Both Rick and Piper fight and try to defeat the odds as terrible realities like peer pressure, the fact that they attend rival schools and even Piper's older brother, her school's tough guy, are determined to stop their love and unity from growing and getting stronger. But it all comes to a hilt at a masquerade party when each and everybody from both schools learn that true love does indeed conquer all in more ways than one.

The movie also doesn't forget nor skimp on the FUN. There are three really funny scenes, such as girls swimsuits coming apart in a high school swimming pool all due to a prank by the rival high school, with an underwater video camera capturing it all. There is also a scene where students and faculty are watching an educational film and a pair of topless breasts suddenly appear on the screen and even when two boys sneak into an X rated movie theater, with a water pistol in each hand, shooting out liquid dish detergent in other patrons eyes, as they are watching the movie, and even making moaning sounds as they are doing so, alongside the stir that they are causing within the theater. Again, the FUN is not forgotten and the action never lets up

What more could you ask for in this, the ULTIMATE teen flick of the 1980's and the most FUN ever made that you can enjoy again and again. Again, what more could you ask for in a teen styled romantic comedy musical film with a little Shakespeare added to sweeten it.

I watched this movie back in 1986 on HBO at my sister's house and I enjoyed it immensely. I watched it again five years ago when I picked up a rare VHS of this on Amazon and I still enjoyed it immensely as I did when I first saw it. I am glad that it is finally on DVD and that I have it in my ever growing DVD library.

PROS: The movie looks very colorful and the audio sounds great. The soundtrack sounds even crisper.

CONS: There are no special features like a theatrical trailer, TV spots(if any), no commentaries by the film's production crew and/or the colorful cute cast(which would have been interesting), and also, there are no scene selections and no starter menu. It is also in Fullscreen and not Widescreen, or at least on my Samsung 40 inch flat screen TV it looks like it is in Fullscreen as the vast majority of any 16x9 film on DVD looks on my TV screen. It is simply like they used a VHS master and transferred it to DVD.

Still, despite the negatives, it is still finally on DVD, and that is truly wonderful.

Now, if they would only and finally release the soundtrack on vinyl, CD and digital download, that would really make it complete.

If you lived in the 1980's or even wished you were young again, then pop this movie in your DVD player when you buy it and get ready to relive those days again. You'll be glad that you did. It is the most fun that you can have watching a teen movie.",1323302400,3,3541,4.359635811836116
