The doctor just sits and talks non stop. He does show a summary table for each problem. Each of them is covered very briefly.  It's better to read a book about this subject. It's because the book has illustrations and more details.

I junked this DVD. Luckily for me, it cost me much less than the rental fee of a disc",1312502400,,387,4.347222222222222
