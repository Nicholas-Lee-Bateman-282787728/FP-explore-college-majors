8210808,5,B000TSXX7A,I love the Little Bear stuff because it is quiet and sweet and the perfect little program to end a busy day with your child. Little bear comes from a loving family and has all sorts of adventures OUTSIDE with his animal friends and he is not a fresh boy with wise cracks spilling out of his mouth. My grandchildren love him and I find him refreshing.,1371427200,2,350,4.2388059701492535
