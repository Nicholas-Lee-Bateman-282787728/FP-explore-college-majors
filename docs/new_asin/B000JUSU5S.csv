8153257,3,B000JUSU5S,"I felt the documentary didn't go deep enough on the symbolism and the for the founding forfathers who became masons. The Changing of the Reverse of the Dollar Bill was insisted by the Vice President (who was also a mason) of D. Rossevelt according to other documentaries I have seen. More Detail on the symbolism of the eagle, breast plate, Bars & Spaces. The 14 Presidents who became masons, the 9 who signed the declaration of Independants. Maybe a large display of Models representing Memorials in the 4 directions (N, S,E & W) on an open table and comparing it to a map of Wash. DC, to show the Compass and Square may be better. Also who ever filmed the documentary when they were walking around Wash DC, (D. Rosevelts memorial) you could tell the person was walking because the picture was bouncing up and down. Also some lighting issues as well. I would have to say the History Channel on the documentary of the Free Masons did a much better job.",1366502400,,952,4.540697674418604
