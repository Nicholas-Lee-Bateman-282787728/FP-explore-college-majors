Shauni breathing life back into that poor little, girl Tiana was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. These were definitely the glory days and years  of Baywatch with Mitch and Hobie and Shauni and Eddie, Harvey, Ben and Capt. Thorpe. I only watch seasons 1,2, and 3 and stopped watching after Shauni and Eddie and Harvey and Ben and Capt. Thorpe left the show. This episode just made me cry tears of joy so much. It was such a beautiful and inspirational episode of true heroism. I loved that Shauni and Eddie made Tiana and her brother's life and future more brighter by signing them up in the inner city kids junior lifeguard program and made those poor kids forget about their horribly dangerous neighborhood infested with crime and gang bangers. I'm so glad that Tiana's brother turned away from his gang banger life and turned to something wholesome and beautiful which is learning how to save lives. Not only was this episode beautiful and inspirational but it was extremely halarious with the ""Toxic Mutant Jellyfish"" Harvey was spreading rumors about and joking about. I loved those yellow t-shirts he made too of that jellyfish and he looked so funny selling them on Venice Beach. I love Harvey; not only is he HOT, but he's extremely halarious. Getting back to the more serious stuff, I loved how Shauni's dad finally told her how proud he was of her and the proud look on both his and her mother's faces when Shauni received her Medal of Valor for infinitely risking her life to save Tiana. I love how this episode emphasizes that we should honor Lifeguards because like Firemen, they risk their lives eveyday to save a life. A very beautiful episode. One of the best episodes of Baywatch ever. What I love about this video too that unlike the DVD sets; they actually do not DUB ANY SONG!!!!!!!! It contains both the killer and awesome original theme song ""I'm Always Here"" and the ending theme song ""Current of Love""!!!!!! Boy, my favorite part of the opening is theme is always the part when Billy Warlock or Eddie is introduced--I'm SOOOOOO IN LOOOOOOVE with that guy!!!!!!! :) I'm in heaven in every scene I watch of him!!!!!!!! Best cast of Baywatch hands down are Billy Warlock, Erika Eleniak, Tom McTigue, Monte Markham, Richard Jaeckel, and of course David Hasselhoff and Jeremy Jackson still all together as one big happy family. When they were all together; Baywatch was awesome; but after the break up--Baywatch was never the same again. Only seasons 1, 2, and 3 are the REAL Baywatch and Glory years of Baywatch for me.",1438732800,,2646,4.7272727272727275

7840866,3,6303162320,"I watched the show and never really liked it that much. But I enjoyed seeing all the women running around in their red sexy swimsuits. David Hasselholff was a pretty cool guy though. I heard a rumor hs character was killed off in the final episode. But nothing can be more fantastic than seeing an erotic scene of babes runnig around on the beach calling attention with their bikinis. I have never seen this movie, but I assumeI know some about it due to what I had seen on the show. Th plots for the story were very stupid, but women in swimsuits were excitement for me. If they showed them enough, I was satisfied. Big Time!",1005436800,2,626,4.358974358974359
