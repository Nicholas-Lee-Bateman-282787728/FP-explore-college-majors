8135897,1,B000H1RFU0,"I had high hopes for this movie.  Jeremy Sisto, Poppy Montgomery, and Vanessa Marcil are some of my favorites.  And although the acting was good; the script, directing, and production were simply poor.  I downloaded this and took it on a plane.  If I had not been trapped on a plane for hours, I doubt I would have made of through it.  I kept hoping it would get better, but it did not.  Can not recommend you spend you money on this one.",1348272000,2,438,4.216867469879518
8135898,5,B000H1RFU0,"I was thrilled to have found such a well done independent film shot in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas.

The acting is complimented by the direction and editing to make it all such a pleasure to view. So many unexpected elements makes this film so much better than the cookie cutter approach so many take to filmmaking, but without sacrificing structure as well.

Overall, such a pleasure to watch and I will be enjoying it often in the future.",1342224000,,452,4.567901234567901
8135899,1,B000H1RFU0,"I have never written a review before and I only intend to give my opinion with what I write here.

To sum it up, I wish I could get my money back. I am a movie buff, always pulling for the smart indie films to be better, funnier and so much more interesting than their blockbuster counterparts. However, I should have read the clues when I noticed that this movie bombed at a couple of under-the-radar independent film festivals and wasn't released on DVD until about 10 years after it was filmed.

Waste your money if you'd like. I found this movie boring, tired, already done a million times (and done a million times better) and just not really funny. Too bad. With the cast of funny 'background' actors, one would think they could string together something interesting... One would THINK.",1178582400,4,792,4.609929078014185
8135900,2,B000H1RFU0,"An anguished, twentysomething filmmaker, mourning the loss of his wife, leaves L.A. to find himself.  Or something.

So he travels to his hometown of San Francisco, where he reconnects with old friends and enemies.  There he remains true to himself while he wryly observes all the phonies and neurotics, finally meeting a deep and sincere woman with whom he can begin to heal over the loss of his wife.

This is a typical indie film, in the sense that its satirical targets are all so old.  Phony literary parties with their pretentious poetry readings (one scene bears a striking resemblance to the literary party in Parker Posey's THE DAYTRIPPERS); shallow artsy types; crude Hollywood studio suits (shades of SWIMMING WITH SHARKS or THE BIG PICTURE, take your pick).  Indeed, the whole trip north to San Francisco evokes SIDEWAYS (although this film predates SIDEWAYS).

However, this film in no way matches the quality of THE DAYTRIPPERS or SIDEWAYS or even THE BIG PICTURE.  Many quirky scenes, but the characters aren't engaging enough.  That, plus the sense that we've seen all these character types and their situations many times before, makes for a rather boring experience.

There are a few strong scenes.  The opening with the studio executive is funny .  Even so, the executive, and especially the agent, are very broadly drawn caricatures, which is not true of all the characters, giving this film an uneven feel.  What's worse, this film meanders, like SIDEWAYS, but it doesn't meander anyplace especially interesting.  So I was bored.

Vanessa Marcil's scenes as the dead wife were poignant (I wish she did more film work), but her scenes are brief, hardly enough to save this film.",1163030400,7,1698,4.99288256227758
