made in mexico.",1425340800,7,122,4.3478260869565215
6777168,3,B00OYUMJ3I,"Thought I'd enjoy this more than I actually did. I was amazed how many of Johnny's monologues totally flopped.. and the guests are nowhere near as interesting as in the first five volumes. Jack Palance is just a pain in the butt and Tony Randall a total bore... and that's just for starters. There are a few great moments and I like the vintage ads... remember Morris, the cat? Well, he's here.

A mixed bag really but it still beats anything that is on television today. Each disc has 2 complete shows (1 hour and 15 minutes each) as well as a bonus extra consisting of a part from another show and running an average of 18 minutes. Worth a look, of course... but expect a few flat spots.",1425081600,8,689,4.341085271317829
6777169,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"The master of the genre is showcased in these vault series Dvds, in the way he always should have been! I look forward to many more volumes in this series, as they are the first DVD Releases that make you feel like you could literally be watching these shows when they originally aired. Perfect Release..for a classic show that deserves this great treatment!",1425081600,4,358,4.698412698412699
6777170,4,B00OYUMJ3I,Absolutely awesome with original commercials and all!  Would recommend this for any Johnny Carson fans.,1421712000,7,103,5.866666666666666
6777171,5,B00OYUMJ3I,The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson is still one of my favorite TV shows this set has a lot of episodes I do not have and was well worth buying. I just wish they would have included the episode where Johnny Carson falls right into his desk when he comes out as carnac the magnificent. Johnny Carson did not know the desk was rigged to fall apart that was one of the best shows.there are a lot of funny moments in this set and even though the jokes are outdated they still are funny and there are loads of stars. I was looking at what was on the discs before I even played them. Buddy Rich is in two of the episodes he was an excellent drummer and Rich Little Is in another he could do so many impersonations it was amazing and he really sounded like the person he was doing. I was surprised the picture and sound are good even though it is not a remastered set.,1421193600,10,861,4.100591715976331
6777172,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"So you're reading this and wondering if the hundred bucks for all twelve discs is worth it?  In a word, yes.  Because  lets face it  its Johnny Carson.  This is, at present, the best representation of Carsons tenure as host of The Tonight Show.  Of course you get Eds legendary introduction, the opening video changes as the years pass, and you get a number of the more to come title cards, in addition to a wealth of vintage commercials, which are almost as much of a kick to watch as the shows.  Im 52, and theres a great deal of I remember that one in the commercials for me.

Video quality  the discs are of near excellent quality, and where the creators of this box set have used what they consider to be inferior source materials, they have the courtesy of informing you via a title card in the opening seconds of the DVD.  (the problems are quite minor and few).  Is it blu-ray or HD quality?  No, but then again you have to remember that these are from the 1970s when videotape was in its relative infancy.  Then again, the retro look is, to me, half of the fun of watching.  Its the closest you can get to winding up your day with Carson on the tube before you retire for the night.

Music  Ive read some other reviews of the earlier discs in this collection that complained about the NBC Orchestra being overdubbed, and I have to admit that I believe that this is, in fact, the case.  The music coming out of a commercial break  for lack of a better explanation  sounds far too clean and modern  and then there is an obvious change in the audio tone very quickly once the music stops and Carsons microphone is activated.  Furthermore, in a couple of instances, I can hear just a fraction of a second of the bands last note or downbeat sticking out after the end of the dubbed-in music before Carson begins speaking.  Im not sure why this has been done.  Most of the music youll hear sounds remarkably like the outstanding music Earl Rose composed for the equally outstanding PBS special King of Late Night.

So you don't really get the original sounds of Doc Severinsen and the NBC Orchestra, except for the occasional piece where they're accompanying, for example, Buddy Rich or when Carson lets them take a solo during one of the shows where they're visiting New York City.

One nice touch is that on a couple of the discs, its several shows from the same week in a given year, almost like a miniature time capsule  even more so than the entire set is a time capsule, a throwback to a more fun, slightly naughty and simpler way of life.  (On one segment  which I remembered watching when it first aired  Vincent Price is doing his famous demonstration of cooking a trout in a dishwasher, and Price comes up with a one-liner so full of double entendre you wonder how it got past the censors.)

Hopefully there will be further entries into the Vault series, which I will no doubt purchase in the future.  Theres simply no one on television today that will ever match Carson for effortless entertainment and the epitome of cool.  Its so nice to see the Carson company put some care into these discs and finally come up with a product worth owning that doesnt repeat half of its material in two other box sets.",1420243200,31,3218,4.429301533219761
6777173,5,B00OYUMJ3I,Given as a gift for a sinatra fan.  He will love it.  Arrived quickly.,1481846400,,70,3.9285714285714284
6777174,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"In one word, Awesome, want to order more series.",1481328000,3,48,4.444444444444445
6777175,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"I gave up on the late nite talk shows many years ago, because there is nobody that has the wit, charm and likeability of the late Johnny Carson. And Ed McMahon is the perfect sidekick for Johnny, his infectious laughter always puts me in a good mood. Theres quite a bit of History in these classic shows and some of the biggest movie/TV stars and sports figures make appearances throughout these episodes.

There are so many good moments, some of my favourites :

- Muhammad Ali talking about his belief in UFOs and aliens
- Michael Landon reminiscing about Dan Blockers practical jokes
- Joan Embery placing a tarantula on Johnnys wrist and watching it slowly crawling up his sleeve
- Jack Benny smoking a cigar and blowing smoke on an irritated Joey Bishops face
- Buddy Hacketts 3 appearance and Don Rickles 2 appearances
- The Stump The Band skits and The Mighty Carson Art Player skits with Carol Wayne
- Johnny singing Rhinestone Cowboy and all his opening monologues
-  Lynda Carter admitting her salary increased to $90/week after her first starring role as Wonder Woman
- Paul McCartney finally giving in and singing You Are My Sunshine

Theres just only a few musical performances, from John Denver, James Brown, Steve Lawrence and a few others, but no real Rock N Roll artists. However, there is a lot of interesting conversation, humor and solid entertainment from such famous guests as Bob Hope, Dean Martin , James Garner, Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball, Karen Valentine, Burt Reynolds, Charlton Heston, Robert Blake, Steve Allen, Roy Clark, Andy Kaufman, Rodney Dangerfield and others.

So overall, this set is Highly Recommended !!!!!",1478476800,,1644,4.878136200716846
6777176,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"I've enjoyed these full-length uncut Tonight Shows more than anything I've seen in quite a while. Watching them (especially with the original commercials) is really like going back in time 40-45 years. The shows were loose, a little risqu, and just a lot of fun, especially with the guests featured on the selected episodes. Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Mohammed Ali, Vincent Price, Paul McCartney, Burt Reynolds, James Garner, George Burns - this was when stars were really stars rather than just people who turned up on television once a week. Highly entertaining and highly recommended.",1471910400,6,622,5.1683168316831685

These are great to watch when you just want to kick back and forget what is going on in the world today. I hope they keep producing more of these DVD's.",1462320000,3,324,4.158730158730159
6777180,2,B00OYUMJ3I,A little disappointed in this as of now... but have only watched the first disk.  Perhaps will update as we watch more of them.  Quality is fine... the rating is due to the lack of humor in the disk viewed so far.,1455321600,,213,4.0476190476190474
6777181,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD set.  After having only repackaged clip shows for so long, its great to have complete, full-length episodes along with original commercials.  It transports you back in time and gives you a feel for what it was like when Johnny was on every night.  There is A LOT of material here; each disc includes two full shows and one bonus clip, which often is pretty lengthy.  See Amazon's description for all the great guests!

I can't think of anything negative about this collection, except perhaps the fact that the shows are mainly from the same time period.  The majority are from the 1970s with a few from the 1980s.  Granted, the producers were probably collecting shows with the best guests regardless of date.  The release I would love to see next are the ""lost"" shows from 1962-72.  Most of the shows from the 1960s were ""wiped,"" but 33 full shows from that era are still in the vault.  They would make a great Vault Series Part 2!

If you enjoy this, I would suggest contacting the folks at johnnycarson.com to let them know youd like to see more.",1454544000,8,1084,4.564766839378239

6777186,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"...this is how it's done!  Johnny Carson - Master of Late-Nights.  I'd like it if they added some episodes from the 1960s.  The 1970s episodes are great, not to mention the commercials.

What I missed from falling asleep, I  fast forward to where I left off the next time.  Never miss a beat that way.  I highly recommend this to anyone thinking of buying this.  The commercial's are your choice.  You can watch it with or without them.  They are very funny though.  It all brings back so many memories.",1434499200,8,474,3.9468085106382977

8685512,5,B00OYUMJ3I,"Love the inclusion of the original national network commercials! You can select whether you want to see those, or have them automatically skipped. Nice! Such fun to see the old spots. Like a time machine. Great for context, history wise. Sadly, the LOCAL commercial break intervals are not included, which would have been terrific because the band used to play during that time to keep the audience entertained and the network would put that music on the line along with a slide, so local stations would have something to go to in case they had a failure of their local commercials. The Tonight Show Band was AWESOME and such a favorite of Johnny. It was a rare treat to attend a show in person, or even to watch a station that had trouble and therefore put the band back on during the local break interval. Perhaps the music was not included in this release due to issues with music rights, but it would have been so wonderful if it could have been. Perhaps they will someday do a release that features the music played during the local breaks! Wouldn't that be GREAT?!?!? Just like being in the audience!!!",1519603200,,1108,4.601010101010101

8685520,5,B00OYUMJ3I,I was not alive when johnny carson hosted the tonight show but I can honestly say that he puts all other late night talk show hosts to shame the set is well worth the money you spend on it from the first show to the last one it is non stop laughs the only thing I think they could have done was include more shows where he did the sketches those were the highlights of the shows he did but other then that a great buy the best show in the entire set is the tenth anniversary show,1482796800,3,479,3.8979591836734695
