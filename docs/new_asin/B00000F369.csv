This was the way I remember movies were made back in the 80's when I was a little kid before stupid political correctness and Hollywood's obsession with massively producing endless early teen friendly PG-13 super hero or Star Wars type flicks took over the industry (wit adults and older teens left with little options but having to watch HBO tv shows for art with more intense content).

 I did have some problems with the screen writing and action sequences, for example in one scene the old man has his rifle pointed at the monster with a very easy shot a 9 year old kid could make, but instead he drops it and goes for an ax to fight the beast.  That part I was shouting at the screen it is so ridiculous, but for the most part I did not expect much coming from this movie but got a lot in return.  The rational for the monsters or aliens are not explained too well, but I guess that isn't the point when one watches a morsel like this one.

 Basic premise: Horny college age guys and girls go camping in the woods and sleep over this log cabin.  An old man who is a native to the lost woodland turf warns them of danger.  Then the horror fest of laughable absurdity begins in earnest.

  After the first twenty minutes I had thought, well maybe it is okay but it is the same as every other 80's movie of that type, horny teens and other walking pieces of meat run into monster or slasher and get hacked up until one fights back to survive (at least live until the sequel).  But this one did have a slightly different ending theme which surprised me a bit. Plenty of pretty girls featured in it too. In many ways this movie reminded me of those old Italian horror movies from many years back.

 Obviously it features campy heavy violence and gore, so a few people shouldn't see it at a young age, but some kids & adults who are fans of the ""Horror-Adventure-Sci Fi"" genre from ages 10 and up might be able to enjoy this movie if they can see the horror imagery is a total messy phony joke with no baring on real violence at all.

 Pretty decent 80's horror, action adventure, sci fi, comedy.  I give this one a solid A-, the highest grade I ever give to a camp 80's horror movie because most of them I honestly have given an F to  (such as Friday the 13th part 600) because they are so darn bad.  Liked it so look out for the DVD.",1486252800,,2375,4.200883002207505

7906511,5,B00000F369,It was good. It was a very hard movie to find. I had been looking for it for years and finally found it. Thank You.,1274400000,2,115,3.64
7906512,4,B00000F369,"This is one of those movies that just has it all. It has Bigfoot, Zombies, Aliens, and Satanic sacrifice. It all makes little sense and the FX are poor at best, but you gotta give this one points for the balls shown by trying to throw all that stuff together into one movie. The plot is like this; Bigfoot is running wild in Demonwoods, and an old man and a group of teens are trying to track him down. Turns out Bigfoot is one of the teen's uncles turned into Bigfoot by some alien/mutant that lives in a trash can and has a scorpion tail inside of a crashed spaceship inside of a cave where he is worshiped by some satanic priest who brings him sacrifices (it eats human hearts) and turns the victims into zombies who work on repairing the spaceship so it can return to space. Got all that? There's plenty of bare boobies, blood, and rubbery costumes. A real 80's tour-de-force which is up there as far as most absurd/nonsensical movies ever made... but it is still highly watchable and made well despite all of that. A must for any horror collector or for those who need to see the wackiest of movies.",1240272000,5,1104,4.364077669902913
7906513,1,B00000F369,I had seen this move as a child on USA up all night and it scared me to death but as an adult i found this here and paid a pretty penny for it and was so disappointed and wandered what i had seen in this movie as a child cause this has to be the worst horror movie ever made. once i watched it once i sold it to a local bookstore. Don't watch this movie and expect it to be scary cause it isn't,1169942400,,394,3.5930232558139537
