1908420,5,B0000AKY5Z,"It's just as I remember when I first saw it in Mr. Johnson's class in 4th Grade, Fairview Elementary in Mora, MN.  Very well done, and yes, it is dated, but still great even by today's standards.",1069200000,6,195,4.27027027027027
1908421,5,B0000AKY5Z,"I just got my DVD of ""Our Mr. Sun,"" the Frank Capra educational movie from 1956 based on Donald Menzel's book ""Our Sun.""  The movie runs about 52 minutes.  It includes an eclipse movie, starting with a diamond ring, interspersing views of eclipse watchers around the world, and ending the approximately 2-min segment with the final diamond ring. A little later, they show some of the High Altitude Observatory's coronagraph time-lapse movies of prominences.
  The movie seems quite campy now, with primitive animation and with the popularizing scientist Frank Baxter playing ""Dr. Research"" and the actor Eddy Albert conversing with cartoon Mr. Sun and cartoon Father Time.  But there is a lot of good material there, and there is very little I would change even after 45+ years. I didn't have a single scientific objection to the first half hour or more. The last 15 minutes or so, about solar energy, is the most dated.
Glimpses of some of the scientists of the time--Walter Roberts, Jack Evans, Donald Menzel, and others--appeared.
The quality of the transfer was pretty good. Only occasionally did I notice some film grain or scratches in the corner of the color movie.
The movie was fun to watch. Also on the DVD is ""The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays,"" another Capra movie in the series.",1066176000,16,1293,4.859090909090909
1908422,5,B0000AKY5Z,"Here we have the first two installments in Frank Capra's Bell Science series, ""Our Mr. Sun"" (1956) and ""The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays"" (1957), underwritten by AT & T (Ma Bell, to you n' me). Capra writes and produces, Shamus Culhane offers up the cartoon animation, while ""Cosmic Rays"" has Bil Baird's marionettes playing the role that cartoon characters play in the other three films.
No extras on the disc, but there is an insert with some condensed liner notes. More on Baxter and Carlson, et al, would have been welcome additions to the DVD. Regardless, it will be a great treat for the science aficionado.
In ""Our Mr. Sun"", a young Eddie Albert plays Mr. Fiction Writer, and introduces the Imagination Screen that the cartoons are projected on. Richard Carlson (""Creature From the Black Lagoon"") takes over in the remaining three installments as the Fiction Writer, while Dr. Frank Baxter is present in all four shows as Mr. Scientist.
""The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays"" tries valiantly to explain, so far as we knew in 1957, what cosmic rays are and how we detect them. The idea of a mystery contest overseen by Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky is clever, and the puppets make the science somewhat more accessible. Even so, this is probably the most inscrutable installment because the subject matter itself is somewhat inscrutable to the layman. Try as they might, when Carlson and Baxter start talking about Mu Mesons, some of the audience (admittedly, this includes myself), will get a bit lost.
""Our Mr. Sun"" is probably the better of the two, while some of the science is clearly outdated in both. We've certainly come a long way in the understanding of the Sun and cosmic rays since 1957! Voice artist Marvin Miller (narrator of ""The FBI"" among other shows), plays Mister Sun, and Capra regular Lionel Barrymore plays the kindly Father Time.
In ""Sun"", Baxter and Albert explain what the sun is and how it works. The film of the sun in action is interesting, but has been surpassed by SOHO, RHESSI, and other satellites, which now regularly beam back incredible imagery of solar prominences, sunspots, flares, the corona, and comet impacts. The mechanics of the sun are also more understood then they were in 1957, and solar cell technology (shown in it's very infancy in the film), has advanced by leaps and bounds during the intervening years.
But the sheer enthusiasm of Baxter, Albert, and Carlson, combined with the incredible optimism of the era that is infused in each of the four films of the series, make up for any outdated elements. Perhaps the only downside of the two DVDs (the other being ""Hemo the Magnificent/The Unchained Goddess"") is that the very same optimism present in these films has long since died away from our society, and the films serve to remind us of that sad, long-lamented fact.
""Cosmic Rays"" ends with a wonderful challenge to Mankind to ""come back in 50 years"" and see how much we've learned about the Universe. Since the 50 years is almost up, wouldn't it be fun to compare our knowledge then to our knowledge now?",1065052800,33,3093,4.794007490636704
1908423,5,B0000AKY5Z,The service was very fast and good. I would order again. I really enjoyed seeing these again. Just like my childhood,1357430400,,116,4.571428571428571
1908424,5,B0000AKY5Z,Great video! Presents science concepts in an entertaining and easily digestible way. Great for all ages. Use of animation and humor really illuminates the topics. Fascinating look at areas which are not common knowledge.,1350345600,,220,5.5
1908425,5,B0000AKY5Z,"I first saw Our Mr. Sun in the autumn of 1956 while a pupil at the Thomas Jefferson Elementary School in Falls Church, VA.  The school administration thought so highly of it that it ran all day long in the school cafeteria and each class room was marched in throughout the day to see it. Its safe to say it was a knock-out at the time; since most of us had only seen 20minute, black and white educational films if that. It certainly impressed me forever, particularly since I saw it repeatedly over the years through junior high school.  The nice musical background also made a life-long classical music fan of me.  It was a nice attempt to present scientific reality (at the time) and show that this was actually complementary to religious theology!  That point would of course, not be made today.  Anyway I still think this is a fine film.

But is should be pointed out once and for all that the best quality DVD
of this on the market today (coupled with the Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays), is not the final product by any means.  It is missing the entire solar battery sequence (2 minutes or so), some of the opening titles and all of the closing titles with music (Beethoven).  This is or was a preview print (in good shape) that was probably shown to school teachers and sponsers in advance of the release of the final product.  Since I saw this on first release I can verify that fact.

It would be nice if someone could issue a top quality job of the actual finished edition, (many of these are bouncing around the internet or on lesser grade DVDs and they are uniformly miserable in quality and production values).  Our Mr. Sun deserves much better!  While I like the current commercial edition it needs to be upgraded to the actual final one.",1348012800,,1753,4.460815047021944
1908426,4,B0000AKY5Z,"These two films are awesome! Our Mr. Sun is a great look at energy, especially solar energy (and how most other forms of power are indirectly derived from the sun) and the Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays does a really good job of treating the scientific puzzle of cosmic rays as a murder mystery. The puppets, which take some getting used to at first, are a nice touch. I had fun watching it!",1337644800,,392,4.3108108108108105
1908427,5,B0000AKY5Z,"A once well-known fact about ""Dr. Research,"" who appears as the avuncular scientist in these films, is that he was the most famous and well-loved member of the USC faculty in the 1950s.  And he was not a science professor, but a Shakespeare expert.  USC English professor Frank C. Baxter was known to the legendary Frank Capra, who directed these TV specials for the Bell Science Series, because Dr. Baxter's ""Shakespeare on TV"" had been the first televised college course to be taught for academic credit in Southern California. It debuted in 1953 on the Los Angeles CBS affiliate KNXT. Baxter, who earned his Ph. D. at Cambridge University, thought the show would be a ""roaring success"" if it drew 150 viewers per week. To his astonishment, it attracted 400,000.

Baxter went on to host a long list of network TV programs, including seven on science topics in the Bell Science Series.  He was as familiar to baby boomers as Buffalo Bob.  Along the way, he picked up a Peabody and seven Emmy awards, and Life magazine named him one of the country's eight most outstanding college professors.",1324252800,4,1092,4.787234042553192
1908428,5,B0000AKY5Z,"What can I say? Even now, after what--50 years?--these are great films. The qualities of the prints from which they were taken were very good, considering everything. Even Amazon's packaging was top-notch. I appreciate a quality product plus a job well done. Dr. Frank Condie Baxter is the perfect showman for these movies, and Eddie Albert and Richard Carlson added to the production as well. Did I mention the voice of Lionel Barrymore? It doesn't get any better than that. My favorite of the two was the Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays. These color/animation/live acting movies are real gems. Oh, there is a trace of bologna in the Mr. Sun piece. I overlook that.",1319500800,,666,4.8
1908429,5,B0000AKY5Z,"It was fantastic seeing these films again after 40 years and I am glad they have found their way to DVD for new generations to see.
This is an added bonus after all this time to see how much of the predictions made on the films came to pass.
Even though the Bell Science films were made in the 50's and 60's they are still great entertainment for all ages.
40 Years ago when I was 12 I was part of a neighborhood commuity center and actually had a 16mm projector that I saved money from my paper route and purchased and I was able to go to the local phone company and borrow this and other films to show to the children who like myself had a membership at the community center and now to actually own the films is wonderful.
I think everyone should share these science movies with their children...it is a small amount of money to spend and your children will enjoy and learn from the movies at the same time.",1292457600,,909,4.2
1908430,5,B0000AKY5Z,"I saw this film for the first time when I was in elementary school back in the early 60s. I absolutely loved it. So much so, that years later, when I became a teacher, I always showed it to my students. They loved it, too. The information is still good and it's entertaining at the same time. I highly recommend it.",1275436800,,315,4.180327868852459
1908431,5,B0000AKY5Z,"As a cosmic-ray physicist, this video is amusing not only for its well-presented (though rather outdated) science but also for the shear novelty of its existence. After all, what we have here is the animation of the creator of Betty Boop, a Frank Capra production, and E. A. Poe commenting on the literary merits of cosmic rays, and a pair of very 1950s stereotypical scientists. All in one film. If you're a science geek, this is a must-have. ""Our Mr. Sun"" is nearly as good.",1266278400,,476,4.6117647058823525
1908432,5,B0000AKY5Z,"This is a great educational movie!  But it, enjoy it yourself, and play it for your kids.",1244678400,,89,4.235294117647059
1908433,5,B0000AKY5Z,"I saw this in the early 70's in school.
It is great to watch it now with my kids and discuss the changes in science that have taken place since the movie was made IN THE 50's!

They speak of nuclear energy and solar as well as lots of interesting facts about the sun.
Well worth the money",1227398400,,288,3.9655172413793105
1908434,3,B0000AKY5Z,It has been 38 years since I've seen this. I remembered more teaching and less cartoon. Still It was a good group of films to start a young Interest In science.,1198886400,,160,4.193548387096774
1908435,5,B0000AKY5Z,"I have fond memories of watching Frank Capra's Bell Science films in the classrooms of years gone by, and these movies are still great today.  More than one generation knows them well:  16mm prints of these were shown through the 50's, 60's and 70's and in some cases into the 80's but by that time the prints were well worn with a lot of scratching and splices.  These were so well produced and so much fun to watch that they nearly don't feel like educational films at all.  When these finally got their official DVD release, I was overjoyed and ran out to get my copies, and I was pleased at the quality of the prints.  The colors are slightly faded but the image and sound are clean and sharp overall.  Recommended for nostalgia buffs and anyone who just likes good movies!",1195603200,,777,4.436619718309859
1908436,5,B0000AKY5Z,"When I started teaching five years ago, at an admittedly advanced age, I looked for Our Mr Sun and was so happy to find it. Get this: the kids in my 7th grade classes like it. They also like kidding the living daylights out of me b/c it's my favorite (""Look you guys! It's the same animation as Mr. Magoo!"" ""Who?""). Still a wonderful conversation starter and highly accessible explanations of thermonuclear reactions and photosynthesis.

Plus all your baby boomer friends will be very jealous that you own it.",1182816000,,509,4.719101123595506
1908437,5,B0000AKY5Z,This video was what I remember seeing when I was in grade school in the 50s.  It's still an interesting and entertaining video and I'm glad it is available.,1180656000,,156,4.379310344827586
1908438,5,B0000AKY5Z,"Yes, these are two of the Bell Labs movies you sat through in elementary school: science made accessible by the Scientist and the Writer. The animation is campy, the science sometimes dated, sometimes remarkably accurate, and the overall tone is a remarkable time capsule for Baby Boomers. I enjoyed watching these films with my high school-age children as much as I did sitting on the floor of my classroom.",1179878400,,408,4.927536231884058
1908439,5,B0000AKY5Z,"In elementary school in the 50s, we watched this film a few times. I remember its being extremely interesting and I've always had a great respect for Dr. Frank Baxter. Upon seeing it again, nearly 50 years later, I was surprised at how forward-thinking it was, preaching the virtues of solar power and the need to develop alternate fuels since our fossil fuels were, even then, known to be limited. It was also fascinating to see how excited the filmmakers were that we had developed the hydrogen bomb. There's quite a religious slant to the film which no one questioned at the time, even in public schools. The quality of the transfer is good and viewers will enjoy seeing a very young Eddie Albert.",1174348800,,700,4.653225806451613
1908440,3,B0000AKY5Z,"I love these old films, and the picture quality on this disc is top-notch, but I have to give it a mediocre review because this version of ""Our Mister Sun"" has been edited. There's something missing in the opening credits, as evidenced by an obvious still-frame that's been superimposed over the sequence, and the closing are credits are COMPLETELY MISSING! There's just a still-frame image that says ""The End."" Very poorly done.

This copy of ""Cosmic Rays,"" though, seems to be all there.

I recommend this disc for fans of this series, but you need to be aware that ""Mr. Sun"" is incomplete. There are no extras on the disc, either.",1173916800,10,633,4.693693693693693
1908441,5,B0000AKY5Z,"Having seen these two programs when I was in 7-th grade, and having enjoyed them very much at that time, to see them again satisfied a considerable nostalgia for me. Nevertheless, I found them still very informative and fun to watch.",1170374400,,233,4.7073170731707314
1908442,5,B0000AKY5Z,"These shows make learning about science fun.

The writing is first rate and the structure clear and easy to follow.  The characters, the animation, the music and the scientific footage is wonderful.  Each hour flies by though I recommend viewing them apart to allow the information to sink in.

There is plenty to think and talk about after each program. This is NOT mindless television.

If you have a child with any interest in science between 4th and 9th grade, this is a DVD you should own.  Adults who enjoyed these  programs as kids on broadcast TV or in the classroom may want to see them again.  Although a little dated, most of the content holds up very well.

I saw the Bell Science series as a kid, I used them on 16mm film when I was a teacher and now I bought them for me and our child.

One of the special things about these programs is that there is a strong sense of respect for the subject, the science and the spiritual aspect of the physical world.

This DVD with two titles is a real bargain that belongs in your home video library.  Enjoy!",1149206400,13,1060,4.3520408163265305

7997670,4,B0000AKY5Z,"Greetings,

I recently turned 65 and spend a good amount of time and money buying up many of my lost memories and childhood toys. Oh how I remember those wonderful Sunday afternoons back in the early 1960s watching amazing TV science specials hosted by Dr. Frank Baxter. This time I acted on my whims by purchasing this DVD. A real blast from the past. It is a bit dated, but still a fascinating walk back in time. Anyone who was a kid in the 60s will fondly remember these programs.

A great DVD for that young astronomer in your midst, too!",1415059200,,542,4.356435643564357

7997672,5,B0000AKY5Z,"How good to spend an evening with kindly Dr. Research after all these years!

I watched it, and I still like it, even as I think the movie is a little ""Bomb happy"" in retrospect.  :)  I don't remember if I ever saw ""Cosmic Rays,"" but it was great, also.  They are high-quality.  The involvement of someone the caliber of Capra in science films made for children boggles the mind in this day and age.  ""Cosmic Rays"" would still be a wonderful introduction to rays/particles for kids.  It could spark some discussion and research in the classroom to see how much has changed in our knowledge since the film was made.  Of course, I'm kind of geeky, and such research would be like a treasure hunt to me.  Anyway, loved the trip down memory lane.
