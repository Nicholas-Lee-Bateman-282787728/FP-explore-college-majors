8031589,5,B0002T2R0U,"I would have to say it's probably one of the best Saturday morning like cartoons I have ever seen.  There is kind of a sad ending to the series though, leaving a lot unexplained.  Some say that the series is complete, but I think they planed on having a lot more personally.  Oh ya, and good job on the prompt delivery.  It was in good condition too :)",1290556800,,352,4.132352941176471
8031590,5,B0002T2R0U,"Good cartoon, way better than the sonic underground series from the 90's.
