7862467,5,6304132670,"As a child I learned all of my letter sounds from Sesame Street, I'm now an earl childhood teacher and the parent of a Sesame Street fan. In my opinion, this is the best Sesame video out there and an excellent support to children in developing phonemic awareness. I can't understand why it hasn't been rereleased in DVD format like so many other videos of its era. Sesame Workshop, please bring this one back!",1420243200,,409,4.54054054054054
7862468,5,6304132670,This is an excellent video for beginning readers.  I only wish it were available on DVD.  Since they are bringing back the old school sesame street maybe this will happen too.,1398816000,,175,4.612903225806452
7862469,1,6304132670,"I wanted to get my 2y/o something that would have phonics and be fun; loves Sesame Street.  This show was annoying , boring and had a few strange scenes with characters that actually scared my son.  I just tossed it.",1309132800,,216,4.375
7862470,5,6304132670,"My daughter learned how to read at three years old by watching this video everyday-she loved it! She would go around the house singing the songs which are so catchy that I still have them memorized after 14 years. I don't think they realize how much they are learning while enjoying this,and it didn't stop there,she loves reading even still and does wonderful in anything she chooses. So can't help but think maybe this had a little to do with it-my only complaint is that it doesn't come in dvd so a new generation can enjoy-'learn'",1305676800,2,534,4.572916666666667
7862471,5,6304132670,"I purchased this video to introduce, reinforce and rehearse pre-reading skills with my 3 year old.  This video features members of the Sesame Street Gang: ryhming, sounding out words, and playing with word families. The video subtily teaches the left to right direction for reading and reinforces phonics. The songs are catchy, which helps preschoolers to retain the concepts.  My daugther is learning the songs and progessing forward in reading readiness quite well.  I highly recommend this video for parents that want their children to have a strong foundation for reading.",1157068800,3,576,5.3076923076923075
7862472,4,6304132670,"Parents,
This video is about sounding out words,rymeing,and reading. Songs are Mud and Op. Enjoy this video/VHS,movie",1022889600,2,117,5.9411764705882355
7862473,5,6304132670,"I LOVE this video.  It is the only one I have seen which includes sounding out words.  It made me remember how much phonics Sesame Street used to teach.  I've been watching the show and haven't seen any phonics.  This video has a lot of old clips and some 'new' live action to tie it together.  It is fifteen years old and shows it, but I wish there were more letter sounds and phonics offerings from Sesame street.",982195200,13,415,4.269230769230769
7862474,5,6304132670,"Here is a must-have Sesame Street video, a lot for nostalgia. There are classic cartoons and muppet segments from way-back-when. Great songs and great characters liven up this great video!  END",894844800,6,193,5.225806451612903
