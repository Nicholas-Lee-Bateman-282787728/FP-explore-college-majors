3830472,5,B0020MST72,"People who love opera know that ""Norma"" is a master piece of ""Bel Canto"", and one of the most beautiful operas ever composed. The singing is very demanding for the main roles, and it is very uncommon to find a performance in which all singers have good quality voices. If we look for ""Norma"" in Amazon's site, we can find about 10 DVD recorded before this one, and only two of them have been rated between 4 and 5 stars, Gruberova's and Caballe's ""Normas"". Although I agree with those rates, I must say that this new DVD is better than those ones in many ways:
a)the voices have been well chosen for all roles, and are well balanced among them;
b)the florid ornamentations and cadences, typical of ""Bel Canto"", are beautifully sung;
c)sound and image are extraordinarily good;
d)Fiorenza Cedolins's acting and pronunciation are outstanding;
e)chorus and orchestra are almost perfect.",1244246400,56,883,4.854304635761589
3830473,4,B0020MST72,"I now have both the Caballe / Orange recording as well as this one and I really like both the interpretations.  Today's opera performances are more demanding of the artists as to acting ability, as well as voice  a trend I thoroughly endorse  and this recording has both. The only unfortunate part is that Pollione does not look as though two 'enemy' women would fall for him. In this way John Vickers, in the Orange opera, seemed a more heroic and attractive looking character, even if Pollione's morals are not too high.  Bellini, seems to me to have been changing the Bel Canto style, as there are usually far fewer 'trills' and fancy bits than say Rossini, so I feel that this performance is quite true to his writing.  Anyway, it is a disc I will enjoy many times.",1317254400,3,769,4.503597122302159
3830474,5,B0020MST72,"I purchased this Norma because I was so horribly disappointed with the Caballe Norma Neolithic recording. Overall I suspect this is the best Norma out there especially after reading all the reviews. First the production is gorgeous, crisp in imagery, the choir spine tingling, and the orchestration first rate. Cedolins is as spectacular as Scotto or Tibaldi. And what a range of emotion and dramatic acting. She is quite a looker I might add...and I had a tear in my eye for her at the end. She is supported admirably by Ganassi as Adalgisa and Papi as Oroveso...a fine baritone. Scola as the two timing Pollione has a fine voice but is hardly a heart throb capable of seducing Norma as well as the virgin priestess. Trust me you will watch this masterpiece dozens of time. Oh and might I add this is a gorgeous opera. And a rarity...are the comprehensive subtitles perhaps the best I have ever seen.",1305504000,5,901,4.672955974842767
3830475,4,B0020MST72,"I enjoyed this Norma. Since I learned Norma by listening to the Maria Callas versions, I was prepared to not like it, but went by the critics recommendations and bought it and I am not sorry. There are more famous people who have done it, but I rejected them out of hand because I didn't think they were visually in the part (Montserrat Caballe, Joan Sutherland) or just not up to it vocally. I thought both the female voices were excellent and Norma was really good, both as an expressive actress and as a singer. I think the Pollione was very inadequate, and why both of these females should be so wowed by him is beyond me. So definitely worth a look.",1305331200,,654,4.368852459016393
3830476,5,B0020MST72,"Norma is one of the greatest operas ever composed.  One always looks forward to the next DVD, hoping for the perfect Norma.  I am happy that it will never come; I cherish the anticipation.  Having said that, I appreciate two older Norma DVDs, but the video quality is so pathetic that they are mostly lighted faces and shadows.  I am talking about the Caballe and Gruberova versions.

Of the five Norma DVDs that I have, the present version is THE unequivocal triumph, both technically and artistically.  Technically the color spread is such a pleasure and easy on the eyes, a far cry from the typical dark opera DVD.  A good audio system will extoll the sound dynamics beautifully,  It has the best sound quality among my opera DVD collection.  Artistically Fiorenza Cedolins is an incomparable Norma. In spite of the grueling role, her intensity picks up toward the end.  Sonia Ganassi is stunning and has a superb chemistry with Cedolins.  What a combo!

Vincenzo La Scola is something else.  According to the brochure, ""Today La Scola is one of the most sought after tenors in the world"".  He badly needs the buildup.  In this DVD, he is barely adequate as Pollione.  He is unconvincing as a Roman proconsul, and his idea of passion is to use his hands to grab.  Given a choice of Shin Young Hoon (from another Norma recording), or La Scola, I prefer Hoon.  Admittedly Pollione is a thankless role.  He is a despicable character, in the same league as B.F.Pinkerton (aka Mr. Cio Cio San).  Bellini obviously loathed Pollione sufficiently so as not to award him with an aria, or even a duet with Norma, or Adagisa, before he jumps into the pyre.  Nevertheless, Pollione has previously been elevated to a memorable stature:  N.B.: Franco Corelli and Jon Vickers.

Lifetime regret:  Maria Callas performed Norma in Chicago in the early '60s.  I missed that.  Damn!  She was beginning to ascend, and still had her baby fat.  She went on a heavy diet soon after and remained slim thereafter.  Consolation Prize for opera lovers:  The CD with Callas and Corelli shall rule forever.",1287878400,5,2079,4.758426966292135
3830477,5,B0020MST72,"This is not a ""Bel Canto"" performance of the signiture role of that art form. What Ms. Cedolins does is make an exciting dramatic rendition of the somewhat stodgy dramaturgy of the story line. Her last act performance could be an encore for Cherubini's Medea. Such dramatic intensity! Yes her vocal production gets fuzzy as other reviewers have noted. But Callas  could wabble all over the place. Ms. Cedolins gives us a valid dramatic performance of a Verdian Lady Macbeth sort. Her last act was a little too dramatic perhaps but I'm English and she's definately Italian. I also agree Ganassi was vocally the best of the cast and a true bel canto. Frankly, I cannot see what the girls saw in La Scola's Pollione.
I commend the production for authenticity in making the mistletoe look like it should and growing from an oak branch (it is a parasite of oaks). Also done correctly was the Irminsul constructed as a tree trunk with a marking. This is more Druidian than I've ever seen on stage. The god's spirit(Odin, Woton or many other names) is within or on it. Nice to see someone has done their homework.",1284854400,10,1106,4.642857142857143
3830478,3,B0020MST72,"For those whom Puccini is considered as Bel Canto as Bellini, this Norma is for you. Indeed you might quite enjoy it, and think highly of it (evident from the previous reviews). However, Only Ganassi is recognizably Bellinian. Cedolins' coloratura, contrary to what other reviews said, is smudgy at best, and her phrasing is distorted. But recording is nonetheless no worse than those by Papian or Dessi, and does not stand up to comparison with the great and respectable Normas of the past - Callas, Sutherland, Caballe, even Scotto, Gencer, Deutekom, Bumbry, Verrett and Elinor Ross.",1284076800,21,585,5.104166666666667
3830479,4,B0020MST72,"The reviews written below by those who purchased it, were most helpful. None of the sigers are familiar on this DVD, and since this is one of my favorite operas, I wanted a DVD. I have the Sutherland, Caballe, Pavarotti cd, which can never be equalled, but I only saw the actual production once. Thanks for the comments, it helped me to decide to buy it. Super is the word. Very enjoyable to watch and hear, eventhough there is no notable scenery. I would recommend it for purchase, eventhough the OPERA TODAY review is not outstanding.",1283817600,6,536,4.59375
3830480,5,B0020MST72,"I have been following performances of NORMA since Mme Callas' time and, make no mistake, this is a historical interpretation.  Mme Cedolin, I'm sure, is the first singing actor to show just how much the energy of Medea flows through Norma.  Not even Mme Callas went that far.  Her acting is not only superior; it is definitive.  Such meshing of body movements and music one can find only in the rare Callas footage.

I for one find her voice ideally suited to the role as she interprets it and that puts her right smack in the Callas current.  We are blessed to know of it.  No, it is not the most beatiful Norma I ever heard, but it is the most telling and convincing.

That said, her colleagues do not let her down, and her conductor is superb.  This is a Norma to cherish.

I long ago stopped searching for the ""ideal"" Norma.  Almost every version out there is fine, and one should really know them all.

This one is VERY special.  I wish you its acquaintance.",1268438400,33,963,4.372881355932203
3830481,5,B0020MST72,"The superb voice by the most beautiful primadonna. I have Thutherland's one too,but she is too ugly. Now is the visual era,so Primadonna has to beautiful like Cedlins,Gheorghiu,Dessi and Netrebko. As for information,I am bisexual. LOL",1247443200,4,234,5.527777777777778
3830482,2,B0020MST72,"I think people should stick with the Norma from L'Orange with Caballe if they want a DVD of Norma. Caballe was a true Norma. Cedolins tries hard, but I think she fails vocally. She looks and acts the part reasonably well, but this is not bel canto singing. The production is interesting, but the only singer that sounds like she is up to her role is Sonia Ganassi as Adalgisa.",1246060800,16,376,4.385714285714286
8348565,1,B0020MST72,"All I could see was her mouth. There was so much tension in her mouth, and her lips wrapped around each vowel differently each time, always with so much strain and pressure. I found the singing sounded forced.",1507075200,,209,4.526315789473684

8348567,2,B0020MST72,"Cedolins has an irritating wobble in her voice I found especially unfortunate in the declamatory parts of the role so important for establishing the character of Norma. I thought the bass was pathetic. The part really matters. The opening sets in particular were childish--scriblings on a pale green wall. Ganassi's Adalgisa has some lovely high sounds, but her middle and lower register sounded like gargling. The tenor had so high notes--where are the Correllis and John Alexanders of yesteryear?--and a  most unpleasant middle and low voice. The non-historical costumes in his case seemed particularly gratuitous. Subsequently I bought the old Caballe/Vickers disc--what (literally) a night and day difference. The opening bass, someone I've never heard of, sounded and looked terrific. Caballe was really at her best. I had heard a CD of her Norma and found her a bit screechy, but she was mostly excellent on this. This night-time setting and spotlights worked very nicely for her. Vickers and the Adalgia were very good. Beware of the adulatory review above.",1439942400,3,1064,5.258823529411765

8348570,4,B0020MST72,"I didn't like the beginning of the opera, but it got much better when the story opened up with the love triangle that became the heart of the opera. Bellini wrote some beautiful music, and the libretto was equal to it as long as you realize that it was written in 1830 and had its roots in the Greek play Medea. Very impressive singing. Expensive, but I'm glad I bought it.",1411516800,,373,4.267605633802817
8348571,5,B0020MST72,"The DVD was brand new and well-packaged, as advertised.  I totally look forward to this weekend so that I can view it before going to a performance of it in the Fall.  Thank you!",1405036800,,178,4.205882352941177
8348572,5,B0020MST72,"I learned to be a stage manager in college; so I watch opera like a hawk looking for the acting, stage plays, and director's instructions. This Cedolins/Ganassi version(2007) is the very best; the Gruberova/Ganassi version(2006) comes in second. The opera ""Norma"" gives the resolution of the Medea tragedy. It is important to know how this happens in this opera. First, Adalgisa is the second most important character; she gives a counter balance to Norma. Second, Clotilde is the main psychological stability for Norma; without Clotilde Norma would be totally lost. This Cedolins/Ganassi is best because of the extra stage plays the director inserted into the final scenes starting just before Norma declared herself to be burned on the pyre and lasting all the way to the end when Norma's father embraced her two children. Please observe what is shown in the film the actions of Adalgisa and Clotilde during that period. And cry with me.
The Gruberova/Ganassi is second best, because Cedolins at times goes over the sanity edge, while Gruberova keeps herself just a tad back from that edge.
As a stage manager, I cringed at the close up shots of Ganassi during her ""Mira, O Norma"" singing, which showed her going in and out of character glancing at the conductor. The camera angle should not be full-face showing her eyes looking for the director off camera.
Other than that, I am certain you will enjoy this version of ""Norma.""",1374192000,,1430,4.937759336099585
8348573,5,B0020MST72,"Looking for the perfect Norma is like looking for the perfect Don Giovanni...............it will never be attained.  That is the fun of it...........in my opinion these 2 operas are the best ever and in my mind's eye and ear I think I know what would be a perfect realization of each masterpiece...........yet like a mirage in the desert it never quite can be touched.

This dvd of Norma is very very good..........the production design is interesting and I appreciated the fact it is presented in widescreen.  The singers are great, and I do agree that it is hard to believe the tenor could be such a babe magnet, but one must remember that power makes a man attractive.

The chorus and orchestra are magnificent..................Bellini's wall of sound impressed Wagner and Verdi; the dts 5.1 reproduces that sound better than any other dvd of the opera I have seen.  The orchestra is so well recorded...........kudos to the sound engineers on this project.

If you are a Norma fan, you will find this pretty entertaining...........highly recommended.",1331164800,12,1053,5.022988505747127
8348574,2,B0020MST72,"Music is the heart of opera. But opera is not only music, it is also story, drama and a visual spectacle; and the reviews which treat this performance solely as music miss the mark. The core of the story is a perfectly plausible one, a man who grows tired of his long-time lover (and mother of his children), and who falls for a younger, more attractive woman.

Unfortunately, the singer who plays Adalgisa, the 'younger, more attractive woman', is a fat frump, utterly destroying the visual plausibility of the opera. It is a great pity, because in almost all other ways, this is an excellent production. Some reviewers find fault with Fiorenza Cedolins as Norma on the ground that her singing style does not correspond to their ideal of 'bel canto', but in my opinion this is really a matter of personal taste. She is a wonderful singer; I don't think any reviewer disagrees with that.

In a sound-only version, I would recommend this 'Norma' unreservedly. It is one of the jewels of Romantic opera, and deserves to be more widely known. But if you like to watch opera as well as listen to it, steer clear of this version.",1322611200,6,1124,4.615
