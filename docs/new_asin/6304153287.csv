7862822,4,6304153287,"Features basically six scenes of cheerleaders: #1 is in a lockerroom where a gal disrobes and imagines a guy with her, #2 features two girls in a shower with some contact and soap, #3 all the gals in the shower with soap though a quick camera, #4 a cheerleader and a football player are in a kitchen and food is smeared all over the cheerleader and then washed off, #5 is a soapy car wash, and #6 is a musical featuring Carmen Electra and a squad of gals though little of Carmen is seen.

Overall very engaging and watchable.",1390608000,3,525,4.303030303030303
7862823,5,6304153287,"This is an excellent, sexy and well produced Playboy video. There are beautiful models including some actual cheerleaders. Even if Carmen Electra's ""singing"" is ridiculously toneless, if is slightly sexy in a back-seat-of-your-car kind of way. The best thing about this movie is that the cheerleaders act like our fantasy cheerleaders would act: sexy and teasing, aware that their uniforms provide half the attraction (the other half being the beautiful bodies underneath, naturally).
Given Playboy's reputation for tame and girl-next-door type videos, it boggles the mind to read reviews for a Playboy video that complain about the lack of explicit scenes. What are you people expecting from Playboy -- porn??? That's like buying an Porsche and complaining that you didn't get a Mercedes engine in it--it betrays a certain lack of thought on the part of the viewer/buyer. .... I mean, Playboy is tastefully nude models doing silly things. It has been that for over 40 years. It's NEVER EVER been explicit sex and raunchy action. I believe the VIEWER is WRONG in expecting these things from Playboy. It's not Playboy's problem. As a matter of fact, I am one of probably many people who are comfortable getting our hardcore product elsewhere, content to view Playboy in the spirit it's produced: tasteful, sexy fun.",1005696000,8,1314,5.144859813084112
