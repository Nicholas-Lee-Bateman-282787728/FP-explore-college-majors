8578036,4,B00C7BZG8Q,"This movie would probably get 2 or 3 stars from me except for one profound thing, which I'll get to in a moment. The production is decent (it was released in 1987, so keep that in mind), but the music, plot, and acting are mostly pretty wooden and/or cheesy. I say mostly because the lead Indian character, played by Amerjit Deu, is fantastic. What completely redeemed this film for me was the way in which the Deu displayed the love of Jesus for one man so beautifully.

While Jesus didn't go chasing after people in scripture (such as the rich young ruler), He did say that God's heart is to leave the 99 safe sheep to go find the 1 lost one. This movie portrays that well, though calling the lead character in this film a ""sheep"" would be a mistake. He's lost. But God does ""pursue"" people and draws them to Himself, and He uses people in that process.

I was definitely blessed and edified by the clear portrayal of Jesus' love in Deu's performance. I pray it was merely a manifestation of the man's true character. If not, it was fine acting.",1466380800,,1047,4.391752577319588

8578039,5,B00C7BZG8Q,"I had seen this movie in 1999 or 2000 as a very young child. I recall being glued to the TV, fascinated by Tim's story, Raj's faith, and the friendship forged between them. I remembered the movie a few nights ago as I was reminiscing and decided to do a random Google search; that's when I found the film on Amazon and I proceeded to order it right away. I watched it as soon as it arrived and was filled with joy watching it. A very beautiful story, very well acted, and a great buy. Well worth it! Highly recommended",1442880000,3,518,4.19
