5026357,5,B006WZI9J6,"... about a grupero band from Northern Mexico. Two down on their luck thrash metallers, El Botarga (Andrs Almeida), drummer, and his pal El Faquir (the hilarious Armando Hernandez), lead-guitarist, meet with another down and out multi-instrumentalist, Chucho aka Don Apolinar Caborca (Humberto Busto) who has just been kicked out from the conservatory he played in and left behind by his obtrusive and flirtatious Hungarian girlfriend Margara (the fantastic Maria Aura). Together they decide to form a band, but instead end up in prison were they encounter the local chief of police Zacarias (Miguel Rodarte, from Saving Private Perez) who has dreams of becoming a singer and forms a band with these motley group of characters, so that he can swoon every seorita he happens upon. But first they must get their instruments back, as they were taken by a local mennonite when the band refused to pay for the cheese they bought from him. When they happen upon the mennonite (played by Polish actor Marius Biegai), Chucho notices that he is also a musician and asks him whether he would like to join the band instead of confronting them about some unpaid cheese...

And so our heros embark on a series of (mis)adventures with their band that will have them run into mystic shamans, dubious managers, jealous husbands and girlfriends, a local drug kingpin that holds them hostage so that they give a private session only for him (something we know never happens in Mexico, right?), etc., until one of their songs shoots them straight to number one in the Mexican charts. But will the road to success spoil the relation between our very odd bunch of musicians? Or will they sell more records than both Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias?

As I said, this is one of the funniest tv series I've seen in a while, mixing humor with music and songs. This is a sort of Spinal Tap of the norteo grupero bands. For most of the run of the first season, the chapters generally hold up, though there are a couple of episodes that seem more like fillers than anything else, but the series was quite successful in Mexico, so a second season has already been shot and will shortly be shown on cable tv.

It's good to find this dvd in America, and hopefully they'll also put out the second season as well. There are english subtitles, but most of the dialog is in Mexican slang, so it'd be more enjoyable if you actually speak the language. There are also a couple of extras, mostly about how great everyone in the show is (you know, the usual back-slapping claptrap), but this series is worth alone for every actor involved, as I can't figure anyone else playing those hilarious characters. Which come to think of, is a very good thing indeed. Maybe it's because I don't know any of the actors involved, since I'm not from Mexico, and so it gives this series an air of freshness that is gladly appreciated.

Highly recommended!",1340668800,10,2905,4.723865877712032
8505975,5,B006WZI9J6,"I love this show! I bought the DVD because I was hoping it would have Spanish subtitles which match what they were saying. Unfortunately it didn't. It does have English subtitles, but they don't translate the slang very well. Oh well, the show is so funny!",1515283200,,256,4.586956521739131

8505979,1,B006WZI9J6,"Si a usted le gustan pelculas como Salvando Al Sargento Prez, seguramente est serie le divertir. Pero si, como es mi caso, usted odia pelculas con chistes que puede ver venir a dos kilmetros de distancia, con bromas  que no van ms all de dobles sentidos sexuales y humor de excusado, mejor no mal gaste su tiempo y su dinero. Yo me vi noms 4 captulos de esta serie, aburrdisimos y sosos hasta decir ya no; no me hicieron reir ni una sola vez.
Pero como dije al principio,  hay gustos para todo.
Pero para mi es una tristeza que el cine mexicano y la television Mexicana, aunque han aprendido mucho de los valores de produccin Americanos, los guiones y argumentos siguen siendo de pobrisima calidad.",1411257600,,698,4.531746031746032

8505982,5,B006WZI9J6,"i will add my delight with this funny series.  even though i'm not the best speaker of spanish, i still am getting alot of the humour.  the english subs are a bit watered down, but i do know some of the other meanings of words being used.  mi viejo, who doesn't speak much spanish a'tall, wasn't impressed.  i can see where just having the english without knowing the subtleties of the language could definitely bring down the level of comedy.  i do, however, love chaparrito subbed as ""tiny stud""!  LOL!

the cast is perfect, especially Humberto Busto (Apolinar) and Maria Aura (Margara), and Andrs Almeida (Botarga) and Armando Hernndez (Faquir), whose facial expressions are just priceless.  they play off one another really well.  i LOVE Ignacio Guadalupe and Patricia Reyes Spndola and must credit them for my interest to begin with in watching this hilarious show, as i was totally unfamiliar with los hroes when i began watching.  the cameos are a treat, since they're mostly novela stars from televisa that i'm familiar with.  Sandra Len Becker did a fantastic job casting.

then there's the music.  i really got in to mariachis during La Hija del Mariachi.  LHdN is helping me branch out into the nortea genre.  sometimes the vocals are a little rough, but if you've ever heard Jos Alfredo Jimnez, you know this isn't always a bad thing.  it makes the songs more heartfelt and like just your regular person is singing them.  it's not overproduced to sound ""perfect"", yet it's still tender and sweet.  ""Lo Intentamos"" is my fave song.  ""No Puedo Evitar Pensar en Ti"" is another really great love song.

i am constantly reminded of Monty Python when i watch this.  it has that same funny, familiar feel to me.

i'm starting the segunda temporada on telerisible (sic) now and thought the use of stock footage of Pedro Infante's funeral procession was hilarious.  one must see this to know why; i won't spoil it.  definitely watch this series!!!",1368748800,2,1950,4.786786786786787

8505984,1,B006WZI9J6,"I am concerned for the future of Mexican culture and it's peoples in that their films, as both a reflection and a determiner of Mexican culture, have continually shown the lowest level of plastic superficial banality. All filled with crude, low intelligence humor, action and drama; all supported by excessively cosmetically enhanced females being drooled over by fake macho males. Interestingly all taking place in a society controlled by the Catholic Vatican Archdiocese, but then we know about their ethics. A film culture only surpassed by the Japanese film industry with it's perverted suggestive animated young nubile females with short skirts and large boobs.

Anyway, the film follows a small group of guys that happen to cross paths and all share a fantasy of getting rich & famous in music. They form a band and croak basically one song the whole movie. They're, of course, joined by a, continually changing couple of female groupies who's talent consists of ?? -  well, doesn't matter. Humor comes in many forms and bad is one of them. Hours of bad music; bad jokes; pointless slapstick situations to get out of; stupid encounters with whomever doesn't agree with something.

Approximately a third of the 8 to 10 hours (lost track from boredom) of film was simply reshowing previous scenes from prior episodes - just a cheap space filler useful for a TV season. Another third showed someone's dream or imagination created scenes and displayed them as actually happening??",1347235200,3,1482,5.065573770491803
