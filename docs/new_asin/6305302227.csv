1026381,5,6305302227,"Watching this film is an amazing experience -- something like a great mixture of looking through the personal scrapbook of someone from a bygone era, hearing a wonderful legend retold, and feeling your own visceral emotions fired with electricity.
In making the film, the characterizations and plot were designed in such a way that they are familiar but also unique.  The story defies some of what have come to be conventions (stereotypes) for supporting roles.  And, it betrays what have always been simpler expectations for a story with a happy ending.  While there is sorrow and loss in modern film and earlier film, here they are portrayed without the often contingent silver-linings.  Bad things happen in this film...and we are not given the immediate sense that all will be right in the end.
The title role is filled admirably by Richard Barthelmess.  He did fine work here -- no wonder it led to his making as a star.  But for me, the film was made by the principal heavy -- played by Ernest Torrence.  What a creep he managed to portray -- a villain with a completely perverted moral sense.  And Torrence held nothing back in his postures and expressions.  He had this character nailed.  A stunning performance.
Director Henry King did marvelous work with this villain and all of the film's elements.  Portraying an idyllic rural atmosphere which is soon troubled by the arrival of lawlessness (Torrence and two other actors who play the nefarious Hatburn family), he demonstrates an ability to frame a scene with great visual appeal.  He also manages to be economical in a sense -- one camera angle captures the majority of a scene's action and this is supplemented by occasional close-up reaction shots.  His camera positioning is expert in this.  We are given the best angle -- not several lesser angles from which to view.
I could not leave out mention of the charming Gladys Hulette who played the sweet romantic lead in this film.  As the young girl, Esther, who is a neighbor to David and his family, she gave an incomparable performance.  This role called for her to do much more than bat her eyelashes at the camera and she accomplished it with skill.
So, yes, this film does end happily...but I'll say no more.
It is the sort of film which should be appreciated as something other than a relic from the cinema's past.  It is a postcard from an earlier day -- the message isn't as simple as ""wish you were here"" though.  It has much more to tell us than that!",984355200,15,2477,4.694444444444445
1026382,5,6305302227,"Tol'able David is one of the finest silent films which I have seen. It seems more realistic than many silents. This is partly because of the location shooting, partly because the story is neither overly melodramatic nor comic. Barthelmess as the David character gives a wonderful performance while Torrance as the Goliath character is only just a little over the top in his villainy. He was perhaps more suited to the comic monster type of his later Captain Hook. The real revelation though, is Hulette. She is almost completely forgotten now, but clearly had great talent. Her performance is realistic and charming. She is quite simply adorable. The print on this DVD has been formed from separate sources. Thus it looks slightly different from scene to scene. There is some damage, but it rarely detracts. It is however, slightly distracting to see variations in the tinting. It is inconsistent to have one green scene when the rest of the movie uses greys and browns. One of the best features of this DVD is the music, which is a series of wonderful folksy tunes which fit in so well with the action that even David's harmonica playing is included. As an added bonus the DVD includes an interesting interview with director Henry King and some useful, extensive sleeve notes. Tol'able David is not as well known as many silent films, but really it ought to be considered as among the very best.",982800000,11,1396,4.796680497925311
1026383,5,6305302227,"Widely considered one of the finest early U.S. action films.  Under Harry King's stellar direction, it quickly and quietly becomes a mesmorizing film; it's like watching an antique photo album/scrapbook come to life!  David's older brother is killed by the notorious Hatburns, and ironically, the girl he loves is one herself!  As the honest, non-violent postal worker, David shows everyone he's no coward, and everything comes out in the wash at the end.  I just watched this little flick at the home of my video store-owner friend and I was impressed by this essentially timeless slice of rural Americana which was directed by Henry King (long considered his masterwork). The film contains one of the greatest fight scenes recorded on film, and it's nothing short of revelation watching Torrence as Luke Hatburn, who delivers perhaps the greatest interpretation of villainy in the history of the cinema!",958694400,7,905,5.178082191780822
1026384,5,6305302227,"It may be of interest to film history buffs to know that much of the scenery and buildings in this film still exist today in rural Highland County, VA where the film was shot.
It is a credit to the director that  he brought a cast and crew so far into the wilderness and captured an  authentic backdrop for an accurate depiction of pre-automobile America.",931478400,5,355,4.446153846153846
7889168,4,6305302227,"A big kudos to the seller for a fast turnaround after the first DVD arrived glitchy & eventually unplayable. The replacement arrived fast & is completely glitch free.

Note: 1) the cover photo is the only one that represents this version of the movie. All the other photos are from the 1930 remake that is lost. Richard Barthelmess was not blond!
2) This DVD is the old 78-minute version of the 1921 film with the old soundtrack that circulated before a 1997 restoration at normal speed (94 minutes), but it does have a couple of extra bits that do not appear in the newer version available now.

Not a spoiler, but I'm about to reference generic story moments...

This older version shows a more brutal ""attack"" at the key moment, & at another later key moment a crucial gunshot missing from the newer version is more plainly & clearly included in this version.

The reason this is shorter is not because of cuts, but rather because it plays slightly faster than the newer version which was mastered at normal time (though the infamous ""barrel"" scene is sped up in both for comedic value). In fact there are a couple things we see in this older version than in the newer.

Another thing I like better in parts of this older version is the wider shots. In the first early scene in town there are boys play-fighting in the dirt in the lower left of the scene. That is completely cut off in the 1997 version. And while the picture is much better in the 1997 version overall, there are some dark scenes, especially at the very beginning of this older version, that are much clearer than the new edit (opening images of the cabin & the family are nearly indistinguishable in the 1997 version compared to this version).

It is for these differences that I wanted this 78-minute version in addition to the 1997 cut. The editing is also different...in some dramatic ways, this older version is better. In this version, the crucial moment when Esther utters news to the entire town is before the big reveal of David's fate while the newer version has the reveal before she speaks, which makes it anticlimactic. And the townspeople gathering in end scenes is a mish-mosh in both versions that makes a little more sense in this older version.

It's also very interesting to hear a completely different more melodramatic (period appropriate) soundtrack with this older version. It's hissy, but nothing unexpected.

This is exactly what I hoped for, even if there are a couple quality issues that are mostly unavoidable (I do hope the seller will change the sleeve to have the right images).",1509667200,,2579,4.677704194260485
7889169,4,6305302227,"LOVE THE MOVIE.  HAVE AN OLDER VHS THAT IS A VERY GOOD TRANSFER OF IT.  THE DVD BY GRAPEVINE IS NOT AS GOOD MY VHS BUT IT IS VERY WATCHABLE, WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF SCENES THAT ARE TOO DARK.  OTHERWISE IT'S FROM A DECENT PRINT AND WORTH THE LOW PRICE.",1509408000,,249,3.843137254901961
7889170,5,6305302227,"I first saw some scenes from this touching, funny, entertaining silent film in Vincent Price's film, The Thriller.  I liked those scenes so much that I decided to buy the movie and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a little difficult at first to get used to silent movies, but I like  this one very much.  It has something for everyone in it:  scenes to make you laugh, scenes that make you want to cry, scenes that are thrilling and exciting and scenes that are rather touching.  I'm totally satisfied with my purchase.  The film is very clear to see throughout and whoever wrote the story did a great job.  I was shocked that back in those days, they'd have a movie with a dirty old man trying to have his way with a teenaged girl, but that's part of this story.  The good guys versus bad guys scenario is also part of the movie.  I love it that the movie is about a family who struggles through life working together and who get through the good and bad times by supporting and loving each other, no matter what.",1477785600,,1010,4.352941176470588

7889172,5,6305302227,One of the unsung greats of the silent screen. Richard Barthelmess and Earnest Torrence create two of the leading rolls in this gem dealing with life in rural America at the turn of the 20th century.  Not surprising that Tol'able David has just been added to the Library of Congress list of films to be preserved as representing what is important in American life at a bygone day.  When you view this film for the first time you'll wonder where it had been stashed for too many years.  Buy Watch and Enjoy what is missing in so many current Hollywood offerings.,1436832000,,561,4.534653465346534
7889173,5,6305302227,"A very solid movie!  This one will have you cheering at the end!  Young David Kinemon (Richard Barthelmess) is at that age when he is a boy no longer yet still is not a man.  He lives in pastoral Greenstream safely hidden behind three mountain ranges.  Life is wonderful and David idolizes his older brother Allan (Warner Richmond) who drives the mail hack.

Some escaped convicts hole up on the next farm and leave Davids brother, whose wife just gave birth, a bedridden cripple.  His father (Edmund Gurney) seeking revenge dies of a heart attack.  The family which now faces poverty.  David must step up and defend the familys honor.  In the most touching sequence Mrs. Kinemon (Marion Abbott) persuades David to let go of his anger and tend to the family as that burden is now his.

How will this tragedy affect Davids relationship with sweetheart Gladys (Esther Hulette) who is related to the convicts?  What more can he face?  David does get his chance to prove himself when he meets up with the convicts.  He will no longer be tolable but a man.

This 1921 feature is 94 minutes long and a 14 minute interview with director Henry King (Twelve Oclock High) is included.  Four pages of detailed notes are included on the fold out snap case.  Barthelmess and Hulette did a fine job and Ernest Torrance was a great bad guy.  Film quality and Robert Israels music score are fine.  I highly recommend this one!",1414281600,,1410,4.616935483870968
7889174,5,6305302227,We have to watch this movie because this is our assigment. Not many old movie that I enjoy that much. But Tol'able David is one of the movie I enjoy because of its story. Our fimmakers of silent movie keeps amazing me by their work. This is a good movie.,1402617600,2,254,4.1
7889175,5,6305302227,"Tol'able David is a very unique movie from the 1920s that was the most popular movie of 1921 according to PhotoPlay Magazine. It was one of the very first movies to be filmed on location. I am looking forward to an eventual trip to go see where this was filmed in Virginia.

Tol'able David is a coming of age story from the silent era set in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky. David's goal in life is to drive the mail and passenger wagon into town just like his older brother. This is in addition to his love for a certain young lady. The story is entertaining, and the acting job that Richard Barthelmess turns is really good -- just be ready for some typical silent-era acting.

The DVD's quality is quite good. There are still a significant number of scratches, but nothing that makes the movie unwatchable. In fact, this is one of the better quality DVDs I have seen of movies from the era. I recommend this movie and the Image DVD.",1240099200,4,959,4.443181818181818
7889176,4,6305302227,"This 1921 coming-of-age melodrama is set in a provincial small town in West Virginia, home of the Kinemons and the neighboring family the Hatburns.  The hero of the story, David Kinemon (Richard Barthelmess), knows he's no longer a little boy, yet no one around him, not even his love interest, Esther Hatburn, seems to understand that.  No matter what he says or does to try to prove that he's becoming a man, growing up, becoming more mature, they still think of him and treat him as a kid.  Even when his older brother Allen's wife Rose gives birth to a son, making David no longer the family baby, his mother still insists that he'll always be her baby.  His one big ambition, to drive the mail wagon, is continually denied because his father and brother don't think he's old or responsible enough yet to do it.

Trouble invades this small farming town when some cousins of Grandfather Hatburn show up and make themselves at home on the Hatburn farm to avoid the police looking for them.  Grandfather Hatburn hates the idea of these three escaped felons living in his house and acting like they own the place, as does Esther, but they're afraid of what might happen if they tried to throw them out or contacted the authorities.  The Hatburn cousins make trouble for the other people in town too, particularly the Kinemons.  Things get so bad that David's family has to leave town.  Finally, he's given a chance to prove himself by driving the mail wagon, but that task soon turns into a much more serious contest of courage and maturity when he finds himself dealing with the evil Hatburn cousins again.

Overall, I found this a charming coming-of-age film, although I don't have any nostalgic or sentimental feelings towards smalltown provincial America of yore.  The core theme, of a young man proving himself a capable mature brave adult, is the most important thing, and not the particular time and place where the story is set.  The melodrama can also be a bit over the top (particularly a certain sequence of events which happen one after the other), although I must admit that prior to this pivotal dramatic turning-point, I found the film a bit slow-moving, spending so much time establishing the characters and setting instead of just geting down to the action.  I was also bothered by how much violence there is, so much bloodlust, although at least by today's standards, the violence seems rather mild, and it fits in with the plot instead of characters just doing mean violent things to one another for their own sake.  Looking past some of these flaws, it is a surprisingly charming and moving story that anyone could relate to.",1205280000,4,2645,4.734204793028322
7889177,3,6305302227,"This film is a lukewarm piece of americana. It is meant as a hymn to a bygone pastoral era but seems contrived and manipulative to me. The directing is competent, the acting fair. Nothing stands out here but the scenery. The laughably speedy manner in which members of David's family are crippled, his dog shot, his father dies of a heart attack (all in one afternoon) is a bit over the top. It is only mildly pleasant, nothing more. Not a terrible film but not that important or indispensable either.",1012262400,4,501,4.5777777777777775
