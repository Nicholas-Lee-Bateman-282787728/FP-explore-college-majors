The other seasons available for purchase after #3 specified Region 2, alerting me that they are formatted for the UK and Europe. Since I own the first two seasons and love this program, I was very excited to get Season 3. Now I am just extremely disappointed and out shipping costs.",1383091200,10,372,4.485294117647059

I had watched the whole series on Netflix and was very pleasantly surprised..and this season was a big one, so it worked out fine. The scenery is great and watching the animals on location was great. Big draw for me was Haley Mills...her sister Juliette was also in cast and refreshing to see women of a certain age not trying to look 20! Tis is a quirky but generally entertaining series..animals win top slot for interest,  it give it. Good rating",1374710400,3,535,4.691489361702128
