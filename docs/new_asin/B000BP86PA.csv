2434558,5,B000BP86PA,"Edward R. Murrow, unlike today's Media Meat Puppets, earned the world's respect via fair analysis of world events.  This brilliant and historic DVD proves just that!  Brave and unflagging, Murrow faced opposition from a dangerous source; Joe McCarthy during a sordid chapter in our history.  So sad, that today's so-called newscasters lack the same courage to not only take on tough assignments, but to tell the truth.",1360540800,4,418,5.208955223880597
2434559,5,B000BP86PA,"Very compelling. Great to watch with adult children; brings home the circumstances existing at the time in a way written material cannot.  Combine with Angels in America (re: Roy Cohen) for even more context.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angels-in-America/dp/B0001I2BUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angels in America</a>",1277337600,5,364,8.333333333333334
2434560,5,B000BP86PA,"An amazing revue into absolute power corrupting absolutely and one despot taking full advantage of period paranoia.
Documentary can be slow but is still an amazing glimpse into and amazing period of American History and well worth seeing.",1263686400,4,238,5.2894736842105265
2434561,5,B000BP86PA,"MCCARTHY WAS A COMPLETE IDIOT , MURROW VERY CAREFULLY PUTS HIM WHERE HE BELONGED OUT OF WORK.",1242432000,,93,4.529411764705882
2434562,5,B000BP86PA,Used it in a college journalism class and it was good for several days' discussion.,1192579200,2,83,4.6
2434563,5,B000BP86PA,"When watching the footage of Joe McCarthy contained on this DVD it is hard to believe that this bumbling, uncharismatic and ill informed man was able to cause the misery he did in 1950's America. Ed Murrow had decided to oppose McCarthy by exposing the ridiculous excesses of McCarthyism, firstly by highlighting the plight of a man expelled from the armed forces because of the alleged links to Communism, and later by exposing the flaws in McCarthy's doctrine. 'The McCarthy Years' contains all these programmes in full as well as McCarthy's televised response to Murrow, which he exposed himself as a blustering idiot. McCarthy, despite having weeks to research, manages to hang himself with a string of factual  innaccuracies, from not knowing Murrows role at CBS to stating that Lenin's first name was Nikolai!. This is a DVD which anyone interested in the history of American politics and television should see. If only Murrow was still with us to give the same treatment to Ann Coulter!",1162166400,40,993,4.981927710843373
2434564,5,B000BP86PA,"None of the overrated TV newscasters over the last 40 years can't stand anywere close to Murrow. For the younger generation who may have discovered him trough Cloony's Oscar winnig movie, should get to know Murrow's work through a number of documentaries available from amazon.com.

As far as the previous review, skipping disc is not a reason to reate this movie with one star. That is a customer service issue and has no place on this review board.",1143158400,19,450,4.769230769230769

8090395,4,B000BP86PA,"From strictly a historical perspective, this DVD is great.  However, be aware that it isn't all sparkling repartee...it can get downright boring if you're not absolutely dedicated to learning about what happened during the Army-McCarthy Hearings in the early 1950's.  I was, but still...",1482710400,2,287,5.5
8090396,2,B000BP86PA,"Not what I expected. I am a teacher and bought this as an introduction to McCarthyism and Miller's ""The Crucible."" I was also under the impression that it would be a free return, but when I have to pay $4.98 to return something for which I paid around $8.00, I'll just keep the product. Do your homework before you purchase this. It's not a terrible DVD, but it also isn't something I want to waste 2 days in class showing my students.",1476748800,,435,4.317073170731708
8090397,5,B000BP86PA,"For you youngsters out there, Ed R Morrow set the standard for broadcast journals. Please do yourself a favor and buy this DVD",1437782400,,126,4.521739130434782
8090398,5,B000BP86PA,"If you want to see Good Night and Good Luck without the imposed drama by the actors then this movie is for you.  The real life drama is really more telling,",1428796800,,156,4.032258064516129

8090401,5,B000BP86PA,"This is an excellent supplement to the movie ""Good Night and Good Luck"" It allows the viewer to see the entire broadcasts that were reenacted for the movie.",1391212800,4,156,4.607142857142857
8090402,5,B000BP86PA,"This DVD provides an excellent source of original material.  There is very little commentary by Walter Cronkite.  Full versions of broadcasts, both by Murrow and McCarthy highlight Murrow's thoroughness and integrity.  Anyone interested in the history of the Red Scare should see this film at the least, and really ought to own it.  It goes way beyond the dramatized Hollywood film, Goodnight and Goodluck.",1390953600,5,406,5.296875
8090403,5,B000BP86PA,Fabulous resource for looking at the McCarthy era. Well worth a look. Interesting when looking at the movie goodnight and good luck,1361318400,,131,5.0
