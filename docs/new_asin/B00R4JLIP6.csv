6898686,3,B00R4JLIP6,"They've split up a DVD into separate chapters with no intros or transitions and charged $4 or $5 for each of them. If you want the whole workout--or what is on the $10 DVD, I guess the season pass is the way to go.",1437955200,,214,3.8863636363636362

6898688,3,B00R4JLIP6,"I like that it's a shorter DVD since my other runner yoga DVD is 80min long. But if I hadn't ever taken yoga before, I'd be kind of screwed. The flow is odd and the voice over doesn't help move you into position. The music is also kind of distracting to me. It's ok for what it is but if you've never done yoga, I don't really suggest this as a first time DVD.",1433116800,9,360,3.8783783783783785

6898690,1,B00R4JLIP6,"The DVD doesn't flow.  You can not keep track on where he is going next.  He changes rhythm too many times, that you get lost.",1430006400,3,126,4.0
6898691,5,B00R4JLIP6,"This DVD has a great pre-run warm up and post-run practice. He uses yoga blocks and a strap as well, which many runners will need for their tight hips. It's awesome!",1427587200,,165,4.354838709677419

6898696,4,B00R4JLIP6,"There are 3 twenty minute workouts. They do the job but the voiceover is not very motivational. The guy definitely knows his yoga moves and over all it definitely loosens me up in the mornings. I have not run in awhile due to a pulled IT band, but I am going to try again soon. I try to alternate this with other workout DVD's.",1491004800,,327,4.125
6898697,4,B00R4JLIP6,"I bought 4 of the GIam Athletic Yoga DVDs, and really like them so far. Haven't viewed all the sessions the DVDs have, but the ones I have are good. Not exactly as great as going to a yoga class, and it certainly helps having been to yoga studios regularly, but they are wonderful additions to help make sure I can do yoga nearly every day.",1488758400,,340,4.166666666666667
6898698,5,B00R4JLIP6,"Wow. I'm a long time runner and I have been having IT band/patella problems which have kept me sidelined. I have started running again and was looking for something to help me stretch my hips and IT band post run. This 20 min session (post-run episode) really helps me and I think I will begin incorporating it into every run. What I do like about it the most is that he doesn't have you stay in the same pose for long periods like other yoga videos do. That is what has made me so miserable with other yoga videos. You hold them just long enough in this video to get the stretch but not so long that you begin to shake. He does have two blocks which I don't have, but I didn't really need them. I will consider buying the other episodes too!",1488672000,,742,4.159722222222222

6898705,5,B00R4JLIP6,"These are gentle, yet effective routines.  They really make me limber.  I like to do the warm up in the morning, the conditioning practice mid day and the post run in the evening to stretch everything out.  I don't run, but I walk and lift weights and these routines are perfect to counteract muscle tightness.",1477612800,,310,4.6

6898708,5,B00R4JLIP6,I really enjoy these mini-workouts. As a runner I *know* I could benefit from Yoga but as a runner I also have a really hard time sitting through hour long Yoga classes or DVDs.

6898712,5,B00R4JLIP6,"Having practiced yoga for more than fifty years; I find this yoga fantastic.  I was having pain in my hip area for quite some time now & although I am not a runner I do walk a lot & after doing one session of this dvd, the pain went away. Now I do this every morning.  There is even a hip stretch that I have never seen before & that one stretch really seems to help me. I was so impressed by my results that I went on youtube to watch the other DVDs in this series; then came back to Amazon & bought them.  Have done all three of these workouts now twice & I still swear by them.  Before I did these I was walking around like  hunched over with pain; since I have been doing these workouts I am standing tall & feeling really good.",1465516800,17,732,3.918918918918919

I just got the video. So far,  I've just done the rest day workout.  It was perfect. I ran and did weights yesterday. The dvd workout hit all the areas I use running but it never pushed it too far. I already feel better :) Looking forward to trying the other two workouts!",1457740800,3,441,4.116279069767442

8694066,5,B00R4JLIP6,"I purchased this DVD because I noticed that my muscles were staying tight after longer or more intense running days and I was hoping that yoga would help loosen me up. I have definitely noticed an improvement in how my muscles feel and my recovery when I use this DVD, especially if I try to use it somewhat regularly (weekly). The movements are simple and not too complex, so I don't feel that any previous yoga experience is required. I appreciate that it targets the muscles that become the most fatigued while running.",1499299200,,522,4.623655913978495
8694067,5,B00R4JLIP6,"I love this video...it's like magic. I'm a long distance runner. After a long run, I sometimes can't kneel (butt on my heels) because my legs are so stiff and tight. I do this video, and it makes me feel like new again. Ive had this video over a year now. I mostly do the post run and I actually have it memorized now.  I always do this video before bed after a long run or speed workout, and I literally have no soreness or stiffness when I wake up.

It's so awesome that it's only 20 minutes. If I spent 2 to 3.5 hours running, the last thing I want to do is spend another hour doing yoga.

It stretches all the major muscles: calves, hamstrings, glutes, quads, hip flexors, IT band, groin, etc...

If you are a runner, and you want a good stretch after your long runs that isn't going to require a significant amount of time, this is the DVD for you.",1498694400,3,853,4.120481927710843
8694068,5,B00R4JLIP6,"It's helped. Worth the purchase!
Even with my inconsistent use of the exercises, let's face it- I only do them when something already hurts, my experience is less pain, improved comfort/stability while running, and feeling stronger in my core.  Additionally, glutes and feet have been firing better. It's especially notable at the end of a run when muscles are tired.
Having had little practice with ""follow along"" types of videos, I felt sometimes confused and struggled with imitating some of instructions. Best guess: user error. And- he didn't perform the activities as if he is a mirror image. After learning to follow his verbal cues of right or left side rather than trying to make my body mirror his it became easier and more simple. Most of the instructions were given clearly and the poses lasted long enough to be able to catch up if needed. The pace: just-right. Wasn't a steep learning curve- more of a gentle incline.
Some of the exercises can be performed with yoga blocks or strap.  My muscles are fairly rigid and the blocks and straps assisted in keeping good form even when my flexibility wasn't enough to get deep into the movement.
Some of the work is done on the knees. If you have replacement knees, as my running buddy does, you may want to prepare to accommodate for that or skip a few of the movements. When my buddy has skipped the movements they reported that they felt most but not all the benefits they did when doing the program in full.
Don't have anything to compare the instructor style to therefore opinions are being reserved :)
This vid series has everything you need for pre-run, run days, off days, strength days and a few specific movements for muscle groups  commonly problematic for runners. Easy enough for beginners with plenty of room to be as challenging as you want to make it.
I have felt more relaxed and balanced after- every time.",1497830400,,1881,4.711246200607903
8694069,5,B00R4JLIP6,"Quick, 20 minute videos to help with stretching without getting too yoga-y.",1497139200,,75,5.333333333333333
8694070,5,B00R4JLIP6,"Wonderful product. Before finding this DVD I avoided yoga and post-run stretching in general for reasons echoed in the other reviews: Other DVDs were too long to work through, stretches weren't specific to running, etc. I can say that those two concerns are addressed here. No longer do I have the feeling that the DVD is looming after a long run, I actually look forward to pressing play! Matt does a great job walking you through the routines and they are easy to follow. I would suggest for those new to yoga to invest in a mat or padded surface, yoga blocks and possibly a yoga strap (although a belt will work fine). For me, the blocks were a definite need as even though the stretches aren't too intense, the nature of the positions will make it difficult to get your hands all the way to the floor. Each routine is less than 20 minutes in length and goes by very quickly. HIGHLY SUGGEST that you try this product if you are a runner looking to improve your flexibility and ward off injury. With this product, you don't get the feeling of being trapped in a high-quality yoga studio or part of a Sunday morning routine in leg warmers... Matt is here to help your running through focusing of the body and of the mind.",1496361600,,1222,4.435555555555555

8694072,4,B00R4JLIP6,I have only done the pre- run stretch since I just got this. It was a great way to start my day! The moves weren't too hard but I felt I got a little workout in with it. I can't wait to try the others!,1495411200,,201,3.488888888888889
