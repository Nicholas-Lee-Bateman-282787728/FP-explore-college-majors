3128418,4,B0014BQR7Y,"You forget how funny these movies are, but this package reminds you that Eddie's family entertainment movies are lots of fun.

Nutty Professor 1 and 2, Bowfinger and Life all include a lot of jokes covering; sex acts/organs, fat jokes, gas jokes, nerd jokes, mean humor, etc.

The humor is presented in a classic comedic style that people of any age can enjoy.  Its not quite the same as Murphy's films from the 80's which were much more in your face and written for adults.

This DVD set is priced to sell and frankly quite worth it.

The ""Nutty Professor"" movies are cute for it's display of romance and yearning for acceptance in the midst of crude, juvenile humor.  Both movies have classic lines like ""Hercules, Hercules.""  Murphy reverts to his use of plastic and rubber costumes as he originally did in ""Coming To America.""

""Bowfinger"" was a funny movie about the pathetic nature of those trying to make it in the film industry along with those who already have.  Its full of Steve Martin's humor along with Murphy's.

""Life"" was an underrated movie, with lots of messages about life in the South generations ago mixed with the aforementioned humor.  Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy play two poor young men with different prospects in life that meet by chance and form a bittersweet friendship which lasts a lifetime.",1281830400,4,1326,4.771929824561403
3128419,4,B0014BQR7Y,"This set will contain the following films:

The Nutty Professor (1996)
The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)
Bowfinger (1999)
Life (1999)

The Nutty Professor films are a mixed bag. They're both full of crude humor, but underneath all the jokes about flatulence, the first film is actually a sensitive movie about a good and intelligent man who is cursed by genetics to be fat and stay that way and who craves romance. His experiments result in a potion that allows him to either be thin, handsome, and suave - and amoral - or he can be his own sweet self and remain fat. The second movie just abandons most of the sweetness of the first movie in favor of being as crude as is humanly possible.

Bowfinger is a different kind of film for Eddie Murphy. In fact, in many ways it is more Steve Martin's film than it is Eddie Murphy's. Murphy plays two brothers - one is a successful film star - Kit Ramsey - that Martin's character (Bowfinger) is trying to have as the star of his low budget feature without Kit knowing it. Murphy also plays Jiff Ramsey, Kit's brother, who Bowfinger hires as a double for Kit in the long and stunt shots. It's a fairly clever satire on the film industry in general and on one religion in particular that possesses two things - no sense of humor and a large element of control over the stars in its congregation, of which Kit Ramsey is one.

Life is my least favorite film of the bunch, but that is probably because I've never cared for Martin Lawrence. However, I do have to admit he's easier to take here that usual because he actually comes across as someone who is not as hateful as he is in all of his other films. This is the story of two men (Lawrence and Murphy) who are sentenced to life for a murder they didn't commit after commiting a very petty crime back in the days of prohibition. The men start out disliking each other, but over the years a kind of friendship grows as they learn to survive in prison and look for ways to escape that never work out.",1203724800,16,2000,4.353887399463807
