Toss in quirky Canadian-isms and you've got yourself a great  little show.  I bought it for the nostalgia, but i'm sure today's kids  would benefit from a dose of teen drama where the kids talk like kids and  act like kids and look like kids.",934243200,2,396,4.3561643835616435
7799111,5,1578071984,"I remember watching this show in 1987. Some of the shows were really insirational and really got the point out. The first episode of Degrassi was ""Kiss Me, Steph"" which is about when Stephanie is in the 8th grade and she wants to change her appearance so she starts to wear less clothes. Her friend, Voula, thinks that the clothes she wore in 7th grade were fine and she shouldn't change. While this is going on Stephanie runs for school president and Voula helps her camagain. Stephanie wins but Voula ditches her because Stephanie becomes attached to Joey Jeramia who soons becomes her assistant. Also Stephanie's brother Arthur becomes friends with a boy named Yick and they are new to the school in 7th grade. It's a great show and that was just one episode! The show goes up to season 5 and the last episode is really good. Now the have Degrassi: The Next Generation; I'm not sure if it's good not because I don't watch it. But my children watched the first one of the Next Generation and you can see Joey, Lucy, Spike, Snake, and Caitlin reunited with eachother! It's a great show for teens and if you have some time off it's even good for adults.",1102204800,,1153,4.495238095238095
7799112,5,1578071984,"From teen pregnancy to finding out one of your friends is in a coma due to drug use, Degrassi Jr. High takes a realistic look at life today for teenagers.  The characters are realistic like students you would meet at a real high school, as well as the problems they face. Although I am an adult, I was still delighted to find and watch the rest of the Degrassi series at my  new library on the east coast when I moved from the midwest. If your the parent of a teenager and have a hard time talking about difficult subjects I highly reccommend watching this series with your child to get you started.  This series is timeless!  Highly reccommend for anyone over 12 years of age!",1081728000,,677,4.349206349206349

7799115,5,1578071984,"I luv Degrassi Jr High, it;s really good but hey, wat is with Spike's hair, she looks like a lion. How hot is Shane McKay (Bill Parrott) It's so weird how him and Spike had sex. I recomend this video to evetyone, Degrassi rocs!!!",1050019200,,229,4.2272727272727275
7799116,5,1578071984,"I was in junior high when Degrassi was airing on PBS. So many of the problems I was experiencing were right there on tv! I learned that teens everywhere experience my problems and that being not quite perfect was  actually wonderful. I just received this set for my birthday (24th!) and  still have Degrassi-a-thons with my own outdated tapes. I used to bring  episodes to ""rap groups"" at school, teen sessions for girls to  talk about their problems. They did and said it all in the unique language  of teens aspiring to be adults. This is a nostalgic dream gift for anyone  touched by this show.",959212800,,597,4.584905660377358
7799117,5,1578071984,"Many of todays popular teen shows like Dawson's Creek try to deal realistically with what the average teenager goes through.  Unfortunately, the cast members (not to mention pathetic student/teacher affairs) are too  pretty for anyone to take the show seriously.  Degrassi Junior High was a  show that told the truth.  All the characters were different but none were  perfect.  This show was shocking, funny, emotional, all without gorgeous  stars.  Maybe if Dawson's Creek took a good look at what made Degrassi such  a huge success in Canada they could perhaps touch the same nerve with more  people that the Degrassi shows did to me.",946166400,4,636,5.019230769230769
