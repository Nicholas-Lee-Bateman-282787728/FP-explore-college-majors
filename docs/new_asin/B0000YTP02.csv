1959236,5,B0000YTP02,"With stars, Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment, we expected to be entertained.  We were not disappointed.  The story was worthy of their talents.  This is a great film.  My 15-year-old said this is her new all-time favorite movie.
The characters are well-drawn and sympathetic.  Just as young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) gets to know his great-uncles (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall), we are introduced to this pair of ""Secondhand Lions"".  Just as Walter learns to trust these two eccentric strangers after a lifetime of lies from his untrustworthy mother, we are allowed to learn the lessons of life in pace with him.  There are no plot tricks, just eye-widening revelations as the story unfolds at a satisfying pace.
This is not a small quiet story, however.  There is the rumor of a hidden fortune of which, it seems, everyone from relatives to traveling salesmen has heard. There are hints that it was obtained through the uncles' adventures but also that it might be ill-gotten gaines.  Along with Walter, the audience discovers the truth of the rumor.
There is action, comedy, danger, acts of courage and defiance, and tragedy that is part of human frailty.  It's wonderfully accomplished in a way that allows older children to enjoy it with their parents. You have characters with whom you can identify, no matter your stage in life.
The director skillfully weaves the past and the present and still manages to preserve the confirmation of story until the very end.  I don't want to say too much about the film or it will spoil the fun of experiencing it.  Don't miss this film!",1064102400,18,1601,4.845588235294118
1959237,3,B0000YTP02,"I felt this movie was good, entertaining, but could have easily been much better. You can say that any film could have been better, but Secondhand Lions really seems to ""roar"" that sentiment. I enjoyed most of the performances, particularly Duvall and Caine. Osment was sufficient in his role, but I felt his performance was not up to snuff with his previous attempts. One major gripe I had with the film was I felt like it did not follow through with some threads in the story, it really felt as though many important scenes were left on the cutting room floor.
That said though, it was entertaining. I got a few good laughs out of it, it was touching in some moments, had a nice message, and you can take the kids to this one without any fear. I particularly enjoyed the quirky aspects and unusual approach the director/writer took. I think Tim McCanlies has a lot of potential, and I can certainly see him churning out some fantastic films in the future.",1064102400,3,957,4.53757225433526
1959238,5,B0000YTP02,"movie that just when you think you have it figured out, they surprise you.  I am a Robert Duvall fan and he is as good as ever as the eccentric Uncle Hub.  Michael Caine is fantastic as the odd Uncle Garth but he can't quite exchange his english dialect for a Texas accent.  The entire family will enjoy the story of a young boy (Walter) who is left by his irresponisble mother to stay the summer with his two unusual uncles who have just returned after 40 years of being who knows where.  As the old coots warm up to Walter, they reveal their unusual past and give Walter the first ""stable"" home he has ever known.  Go see it.",1064102400,9,627,4.191666666666666
1959239,3,B0000YTP02,"It was so nice to go to the movies and be entertained. Don't listen to the critics about this one, it is a gem.",1064016000,3,111,3.6666666666666665
1959240,2,B0000YTP02,"Hub McCaan(Robert Duvall) says to his brother Garth(Michael Caine) near the end of Secondhand Lions when told that in 2 or 3 hours he would get to fire off his shotgun at an unsusupecting salesman, Whoop-de-doo! The same thing can be said about this film. The brothers McCaan have amassed a small fortune which a few of their unsavory relatives would like to get their hands on. Walter(Haley Joel) is the son of one such greedy relative.  The McCann brothers' neice. Left by his mother to find where this fortune is kept,Walter is told of the manner in which this small fortune was attained by the brothers.  Or supposed manner that is.  You see nobody is quite sure.  Bank robbery, dealings with the Mafia, or even conning a sheik in the early 1900's.  All very interesting theories.  Whoop-de-doo! Yes, there is fine cinematography, eccentric characters portrayed by great actors, and human beings connecting on an emotional level.  Even cute, loveable animals.  One of which  saves Walter from taking a beating at the hands of his mother's despicable boyfriend. All the elements that make for a good movie.  Whoop-de-doo!  Ultimately this film falls flat and does not leave you with a sense of something remarkable or memorable. This, despite the genius of Duvall and Caine. Duvall's tough, surly character is countered nicely by Caine's calm, understanding personality. Given the large amount of screentime these two had it may sound ridiculous, but they should have been used more. These screen legends singlehandedly keep the movie from being unwatchable.  Whoop-...all right, enough of the whooping.",1064016000,3,1606,5.087786259541985
1959241,5,B0000YTP02,"This movie is a rare find.  It is a delightful family film with real actors instead of animation.  It is hilarious without vulgar humor.  The characters are real people (I'm a Texan -- believe me, they are real!) and they unfold through a story that is unique.  It is touching without being overly sentimental.
The critics are too busy noting that Haley is growing up and that Michael isn't a Texan to appreciate the overall effect of this movie.  Haley is actually the catalyst, not the star.  The story is  presented through his eyes, how he saw the uncles and their world.  He is in awe because it is a very different world than his.  Michael isn't a Texan, but he gives a fine performance.  He and Robert played off each other so well!
It is a movie for everyone who wants to laugh and just have a good time.  I strongly recommend it!",1064016000,3,838,4.376623376623376

1959545,2,B0000YTP02,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good.",1511913600,,1633,4.828571428571428

1959658,5,B0000YTP02,"Walter (Haley Joe Osment) an introverted kid gets to stay with his two eccentric great-uncles, Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall.) While there He is told of their robust adventures and how they came to be there and rich. However everyone else tells a different story. He comes to understand them and some of life through several events. One of those events is befriending an over the hill lion which just may represent a couple of uncles.

It is not so much the bonding formula of the story as the way the tail of exotic places and heroic acts is intertwined with everyday life. I think of stories my own parents and grand parent told of such things as encounters with Poncho Via in Mexico where they sold him horses and were invited to leave.

It is not so much the stories as the goodness of man that was being portrayed, moving back and forth in time, with a few adjustments to history, made you feel that they were your great-uncles who could believe such tales. And yet...

Just watched, finished minutes ago and am preparing to watch again with popcorn and some coffee (nothin' else to drink at the moment, lol).  Also purchase the movie from Prime Video, and come payday I'm going to purchase the DVD!  I'm not a movie critic, but I think this is a done-to-earth family movie, no matter the rating.  It has fight scenes, flashbacks, love sequences and downright lovable scenes of human situations.  I imagined myself as the boy (I'm 68), and I'm unashamed to say so to anyone. I'll very likely wear out the DVD when I get it 'cause I predict I will watch it often.  Don't even THINK of asking this ol' man to borrow my movie!",1503532800,6,723,4.431818181818182

1959738,5,B0000YTP02,Watched it again with my grandson.  I chose it as a good film to help a youngster learn how to be a reputable man.  It is in the same vein of John Wayne's Cowboys.  This overlooked film was his last effort to transfer his life's philosophy to children.  Secondhand Lions has enough action to keep children attentive and enough moral to make it worthwhile for all viewers.  Michael Cain and Robert Duval are great actors and make the film move and get dragged out.  Great time.,1501286400,,476,4.476744186046512

The other cuts included on the CD, add a lot of content to the story that otherwise would not be known.  They should have kept them all in.

This movies promotes honor, honesty, family, service to others, and a sense of adventure without gratuitous violence, sex, or foul language.  How did that happen???",1497830400,,565,4.544554455445544

Was only in theatre's for a couple of months be for going to video and even then went quickly to the discount bin...shame. This was in my mind the best movie that came out that year.

This movie is everything a great movie should be with two of the greatest actors of our time. It is not just a movie bit a story about life. The meaning? I'll let you figure it out.
If you don't watch this movie, you will be missing a classic one of a kind. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies and if you pay attention has some profound life lessons.
Watch it and you will love it. Unless your looking for meaningless movies with lots of porn and violence then you should move along. No shortage of those out there.",1491696000,,829,4.024242424242424

1960016,5,B0000YTP02,"I grew up in Texas and spent weekends.. sometimes entire summers, with two similar Uncles Marshall and Herbert. Herbert had a metal plate on his skull from a WWII injury but Marshall was the story teller. The VA supplied their home, their food, their meds and bought them cars every other year. Their stories included German (NAZI) guns, medals and other artifacts that seemed to appear out of nowhere. They taught me to hunt and fish and shoot like a marksman by age eight. I was astounded at the parallels in the scenes, the stories and the characters.
Marshall made the Ft. Worth Star Telegram three times in his life.  He was once tied to a tree, beaten but left alive by the Bonnie & Clyde Gang just outside of Ft. Worth. In another story he was robbed at gunpoint and relieved of his wallet containing $1300 in $100 bills. Fort Worth Police didn't believe his story until a commercial roofer found the wallet in a storm drain almost 20 years later... complete with 13 worn & rotting $100 bills in a hidden compartment. I had always believed the story. This movie and it's characters touched my heart.
Secondhand Lions 'hit home' with me for many reasons, and I rank it among the Top Ten Movies from the past 50 years. I would love to visit the filming location.",1485648000,,1267,4.532751091703057

1960252,5,B0000YTP02,"Review by Quilt Lady's Hubby;
I happened across the scene in the bar/restaurant on Facebook & was very much interested in seeing the whole movie. I have been a Robert Duvall fan for a very long time, but was not aware this movie existed. We both enjoyed the movie immensely from start to finish. Yeah, it was a little predictable, but fun anyway. Watched it again maybe 2 weeks later at our daughter's house with our 7 year old grandson, who liked it, & still enjoyed the flick. Very little, if any, foul language. There are fist & sword fights, but they are more in the fashion of age passed when it wasn't necessary to show the gore. There are good guys & bad guys, but they seem to be able to become friends in the end.",1480809600,,722,4.2773722627737225

1960266,5,B0000YTP02,"I saw this movie for the first time this summer and it is one of my favorites for family viewing.  I ordered a copy for each of my children's families for Christmas.  It has such a beautiful message to it.
The story is about a young boy whose single mother is frivolous in her love life, moving from boyfriend to boyfriend.  She chooses the latest beau above the good of her son when she lies to him and leaves him to live with two of her old eccentric bachelor  uncles who happen to have a lot of money.  None of the parties involved were happy with the circumstances they were left with, and the story about how they resolved their fears and misgivings with one another is heartwarming and has some fun and somewhat mysterious angels that are not expected.  This makes this a heartwarming family movie that has good life lessons in them.  I recommend this to everyone who likes wo watch a good family movie.",1480550400,13,909,4.407185628742515

If they were to re-release it today, I think it would have more box-office success.  My 16-year old daughter and I came across it the other day and watched it twice. . . it is just that kind of a movie. You will laugh, cry and it leaves you feeling good. Haley Joel Osment, once again playing a character who has family issues, is outstanding, as are Robert Duval, Michael Caine and Kyra Sedgwick.

1960625,5,B0000YTP02,"I am going to try to give a bare bones overview of the movie, with no spoilers.  If you like schmaltzy movies, which are feel good, and perhaps cry at the end you will really enjoy this one.

A tale of adventure, and undying love; two Great Uncles, a young boy, and a mother more interested in finding a husband than taking care of the boy.  The mother drops the boy off with his two Great Uncles with the idea, the boy will find their stash of money, and freedom for herself.  The two older men really haven't got a clue on how to take care of a child, and are not really interested in doing so anyway.
The men like to sit on their porch and shoot at salesmen who routinely trespass on their property.  They also hate to have their few relatives show up, because they are only interested in the money.
They buy a 'secondhand' lioness, which falls in love with the boy.  The relatives visit, and their boys let the lion out.  This leads to a threat until the lion goes we will not return.  The lion becomes an immediate member of the family.

The adventure, and undying love are stories of the uncle's time in Africa.  The plot is relatively straightforward, the uncles love and care deeply for the boy, and the boy has finally found a home.  The stories told by one of the uncles add the exotic to the plot.",1469318400,,1308,4.255060728744939

1960656,4,B0000YTP02,"Sweet movie that gets you thinking about how kids are supported or not supported in life; how hard it is for them to figure out adults; how much it is needed to have grounded, generous, authentic and loving adults in your life, at all times of course, but especially during coming-of-age. Given the struggles that boys have in our society - lack of role models, no encouragement to express their feelings, needing to put on a brave front~ to name a few, a movie like this comes as a reminder that physical presence combined with compassion and encouragement really does help a boy to feel himself. We need more movies like this. It is also a reminder of the power of story and how important it is for elders to share their stories.",1468800000,16,731,4.503759398496241
1960657,5,B0000YTP02,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in many a year.  I kept seeing a clip of it and decided to watch the entire thing.  Glad I did.
I rented the video and streamed it to my computer.
From the start, I was interested.  And that's a lot for me to say.  I'd say 99% of movies I watch lose me in the first 10 minutes.  I was hooked from the start on this one.
Robert Duvall and Michael Caine play two elderly brothers in 1962 Texas taking in their great-grandnephew, Walter.  Walter is a 14 year old boy who's mother is about as undependable as they come.
At first, the two brothers are hesitant about taking Walter in, but quickly become attached to him.
Before long, their farm is growing a lot of corn, 5 dogs, a pig and an African lioness.  They spend a lot of time shooting at salesmen (hysterical) and finding ways to get rid of other relatives who only want their rumored stash of millions of dollars.
After awhile, Walter's Uncle Garth (Michael Caine) tells Walter a tale how they obtained millions of dollars and of Uncle Hub's (Robert Duvall) long-lost love, Jasmin.
Walter's mother returns with her newest boyfriend with a tale of their own about bank robbers stealing money during the 20s and 30s.
This is a swashbuckling, humorous, tale of cantankerous oldsters with big, fearless hearts and of a young boy growing into manhood.  It's such a pleasant change from the garbage on tv or in theaters that I'm thinking I should have just bought it instead of renting it.  I'd like to see it again and again.",1468713600,3,1516,4.424460431654676

By turns funny and heartbreaking, with more than a bit of magic thrown in, it is an engaging, well acted story of two grumpy and rather mysterious old men seen through the eyes of a lonely young boy left in their care.  And, in the end it is a deeply felt story of coming of age and growing old on your own terms.  Watch it, and then, watch it again.  It is that good.",1467936000,2,545,3.909090909090909

Robert Duvall is one of my favorite actors, and Michael Caine makes my list as well, although a little further down. So this may be a bit biased when all is said and done. This film is a thoroughly contrived tale with more swashbuckling than one might expect of our esteemed cast, but an enjoyable tale above all else. Eccentric old men with unlimited funds and seemingly unlimited imagination, with a tween-ager around as supervision makes for a pretty fast-paced tale, even if they DID buy some used livestock. The ending cements it all together and makes the heroes more heroic and the tales of derring-do derring-doier...",1454112000,,693,4.783333333333333

The cast, including Michael Caine, Robert Duval. and Haley Osment, is outstanding.  Haley Osment, as the young boy, communicates beautifully using minimal words.

I have been recommending it to my friends and many of them say they already watched and enjoyed it. Michael Cain, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment are outstanding. They seem to become their characters so thoroughly that you forget they are acting. Kyra Sedgwick is terrific as the irresponsible mom. I thought the bar scene was one of the best. Made me want to stand up and cheer for the old guys taking on the punks. They they took it a step further which made me like them even more. I think almost any one would enjoy this movie.

It's a coming-of-any-age movie played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, MIchael Caine, and Robert Duvall, with a dashing Christian Kane and the exotic Emmanuelle Vaugier rounding out the stories.

1961540,4,B0000YTP02,"Over summer in the early 1960s, everything in the lives of a family of strangers is about to change forever... For 14-year old Walter (Haley Joel Osment), his neglectful whore of a mother drops him off with his two great uncles' farm in rural Central Texas. Ugh. These brusque and eccentric old men (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) are rumored to have been bank robbers and that loads of money were buried on their property somewhere. The boy, ignored at first begins to become a real part of the old uncles. Unlike other family members who only wanted their money, the boy really cared about them. The uncles purchased an old lion that became the boys pet, which is where the title of the show comes. Little by little, at the boys insistence stories were revealed about a vivid, tale set in a long-ago exotic, mysterious place where men rode stallions and fought with swords; where beautiful princesses tangled with treacherous sheiks; and where the two unlikely heroes lived an adventure of which most people only dream. The movie is good. Unfortunately the disc was damaged when I received it. Because the cost of the dvd was less than the shipping I did not send it back. But it is an enjoyable movie I'm sure you'd enjoy.",1444608000,4,1227,4.658986175115207

You have Robert Duvall and Michael Caine as two brothers having adventures when young and come home to ""retire"" on the Texas ranch. With rumors abounding of riches the brothers have buried circulate, these two do ""target practice"" by  shooting at every relative and salesmen who shows up on their property. Without going into too much detain that has already been shared in previous reviews.

1961676,5,B0000YTP02,"After watching Secondhand Lions for the fourth or fifth time and deciding it was one of my all time favorites, decided to give my own two cents opinion of it.  To begin with, I find Michael Caine and Robert Duvall two of the finest character actors of our times and their talent comes barreling on the screen as Hub and Garth McCann, two over the hill brothers who feel like they still have a lot of living left to do, and do they do it well!

Their niece, played by Kyra Sedgwick, comes to the uncle's unpainted dilapidated house in a cloud of dust to dump her disgruntle teenage son , Walter played by Haley Joe Osmet, on them while she goes off for her ""education"".  Things don't get off to a very good start with the odd trio.  Walter seems to have been city bred and the uncles don't live with any luxuries.  One thing is quite obvious, though, Walter has not had a very nurturing mother.  Other than to pawn off her son on the uncles, she's instructed him to find out where the uncles have hidden their reportedly extreme wealth.

Hub and Garth know nothing about raising kids but in their own unconventional way, inroads are made between them and a truce begins.  Stories are told about far off lands and a beautiful woman Hub supposedly once loved.  Walter begins to look forward to these stories and encourages the old men to tell of their adventures.

A large crate arrives and Walter discovers a lion is inside.  The old men had wanted to have a lion hunt so had ordered a lion.  But the lion is so old and sick, that this agenda is scrapped.  Walter feeds and waters the lion and the days change from spring to summer.  The three of them had planted a huge garden of corn and when the lion escapes, this is where he goes, his own private jungle.  They let him stay there in his blissful old age.

The uncles continue to live their nonconformist lives and Walter is slowly changing and coming to appreciate his life with them.  His mother returns with her greedy new boyfriend, chaos ensues, and you will just have to watch the movie to see a grand ending.  If you come out of this with a dry eye, then you are a better person than I.

Excellent acting by the entire cast makes this quirky  movie unforgettable and it is one of the few movies that the entire family can watch together.  Young and Old.",1441497600,,2312,4.3426573426573425

1961771,5,B0000YTP02,"A pleasant surprise, well acted, and entertaining without being overly cute or cloying.  Perhaps most surprising was Osment's performance.  He was not over the top and aside from his voice dropping towards the end of the film, due to the onset of puberty, does a credible job, holding his own with Caine and Duvall.  Well worth watching again.  And there are no worries about letting the kids watch this either.",1440028800,,411,4.828571428571428

1961807,4,B0000YTP02,"Robert Duvall was perfect as an ornery old guy who had plenty of lessons to teach Haley Joel Osment, who seemed lost after his Mom dropped him off (to get him out of her hair). Michael Caine, who muffled his hard-core English accent for this role, wasn't as interesting a character. But the story is well-told. Duvall's little talk to the boy about the things that are important in life was pitch-perfect.",1439164800,,405,4.638888888888889

1961817,5,B0000YTP02,"You can't go wrong with the Duvall/Caine combination!!  Great movie for families... really, anyone.  Powerful messages with no need for ""shock"" elements - profanity, violence, sex, etc.  Not too kid-centered - adults would get just as much enjoyment!  The travels and stories from these two unlikely heroes, seemingly fabricated because they seem too far-fetched, keep you entertained all the way to the closing credits.  I appreciated how they didn't modernize the behaviors, either -- some of the interaction scenes were powerful and frustrating, until you realized that in that day and age, there was a ""place"" for everyone.  Women and children didn't challenge what was told to them - if an adult told a child to do something, or a man ordered a woman to go somewhere, there was no discussion. Differences in culture from then to today were very well represented. And, of course, we thoroughly enjoyed the humor!!  Terrific movie - we will watch again and again!",1438819200,,966,5.037735849056604

1961897,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions has great actors, a twisty story line, and a lion. What more can a person ask for? My wife and I watched this 2003 movie at the suggestion of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Osment is dumped off by his mother with two old great uncles, who may be rich. At least the Mother and other relatives think so. Initially the uncles all but ignore poor Haley, who has bounced around relatives and orphanages all his life. When he runs away, first the uncle played by Caine, and then the enigmatic uncle played by Duvall, accept the responsibility to raise him. The Duvall uncle has a past that haunts him in his sleepwalking nights. But was he really in the French Foreign Legion, or was he a bank robber, or is all of it bunk? The main three actors give fantastic performances as Haley's character goes from a castoff young fourteen-year-old to a confident young man.

Writers should watch the director's commentary where he talks about the balance between exposition and pacing, and character transformations.",1436227200,6,1023,4.747191011235955

1961950,5,B0000YTP02,"Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are wonderful in this movie, as is Haley Joe Osment. This is a wonderful film that everyone in the family will enjoy--and just how rare is that? The story is of two somewhat eccentric bachelor brothers, uncles to Osment's character, who have led lives of daring and adventure and are now hidden away on a remote rural piece of property. Osment's character comes to live with them out of sheer desperation and that is where the story begins.

The movie is filled with warmth, humor and lots of adventure. You simply couldn't ask for better acting and better writing (and apparently directing). You have to think that the cast had a lot of fun making this film, they just seem like they're having a great time.

A terrific summer family movie.",1433289600,4,773,4.676470588235294

1962091,5,B0000YTP02,"I remembered watching this in 2003 or 4 while my old respite provider and friend took me to the racing tracks and I thought I liked it. I also remembered seeing it on a Friday night. I admired Sir Michael Caine for more than a decade since Muppet Christmas Carol. Though my admiration of him grew stronger when I saw this again a few years after that. I had the phobia when I first saw it in scenes with Jasmine with or without the crate roaring like a leopard whether her mouth is moving or not as I can tell from the running scenes. This was a year or two since I admired Haley Joel Osment. (I admired Haley from Hunchback of Notre Dame II.) When Garth was telling the story of Hub and Jasmine, I would often think about Aladdin and other Arabian stories. Each time I see the scene where Hub, Garth and Walter examine Jasmine in the crate, I think about what would've happened if it were for real. She would've left the crate, pin and attack them; maul them to death. I think Jasmine would've done the same thing for the two boys who cracked the crate to see her later in the movie. But no. The only person she would ever attack is Stan. When people keep exotic animals as pets, they would bring home an animal as a cub, chick, baby, etc. Fully grown animals (even those who are elderly) are not tame. And I heard that old lions are mean. Someday, it'll be in my own home.",1426204800,,1374,4.208333333333333

1962128,5,B0000YTP02,"This movie has everything one could want in a movie. Humor, drama, free spirits, action, and face palm moments.
A pair of surly old men take in a milquetoast young man giving him the father figures he so desperately desires.
Having amassed a small treasure in their youth, these curmudgeons live life on their own terms. They bow to no one else's opinions.
But, they are still rife with a keen sense of decency and honor. While having no patience for arrogance or those that only seek to find a spot in their will, they find another treasure in the heart of a boy. A boy that is only trying to find his place in the world after his insanely shallow mother abandons him with instructions to find where the money is stashed.
This movie portrays a simpler, less complicated life that many of us strive for. Where the line between good and evil is less blurred. It makes for a good escape that will enrich your sense of ""The finer things in life"". Definitely a bucket list movie.",1424390400,8,975,4.4525139664804465

1962178,4,B0000YTP02,"Another film lent to us by friends, family movies are generally not really our thing. However, in the absence of anything on telly & not looking gift horses etc. we thought we'd give it a go.

The story of a young boy left with his peculiar uncles by his feckless mother, it could easily have been trite, mawkish drivel. Thankfully, it was not. Duval and Caine as the two cantankerous uncles with a shady past are delightful and plainly having a great time while Osment, last seen by us in `The Sixth Sense', was perfect for the role. Not surprisingly, it ticks all of the cheesy family movie genre check boxes and there is not much of a plot but it doesn't matter. Well constructed with a deep vein of surprisingly subtle humour, it's a heart-warming, gentle, easy and engaging movie. This film has everything; eccentric old men with guns, mysterious wealth, greedy relatives, dogs, a pet pig and a retired lion. Oh... and a really nice ending. Who could ask for more on a wet & cold November afternoon?",1421452800,,1004,4.5777777777777775

They are, however, believed to be wealthy, though still frugal, but is this money rightly theirs, or are their African stories about how they attained their fortune just fictional tales by two crazy old men?  Being an Uncle and Great Uncle may make me a little biased about this movie about Great Uncles (or just uncles who are great), but so be it, because ""Secondhand Lions"" overflows with rich imagination and adventurous storytelling, complete with visuals and surprises around every corner, a true lightweight charmer.",1410652800,2,926,5.03921568627451

1962838,5,B0000YTP02,It's the story of a young boy who is abandoned by his mother and left to stay with her eccentric uncles (his great uncles). These uncles (Robert Duvall and Michael Cain) who amaze the boy withn their exploits of younger days; in the Foreign Legion and Duvall's love story. A fun movie that I enjoy over and over again. Worth the watch...,1399161600,,337,4.451612903225806
1962839,5,B0000YTP02,Movie was recommended to me and lived up to the opinion. Nice to see a family movie that required no foul language. Very impressed with the young actor.,1398988800,,152,4.464285714285714
1962840,5,B0000YTP02,Preteen Walter(Haley Joel Osment) is left in the care of his eccentric uncles Hub(Robert Duvall) and Garth(Michael Caine) by his irresponsible mother(Kyra Sedgwick).  After a cool introduction a bond is soon forged between the three as the elder gents regale Walter with tales of derring do that teach the youngster that there is a big world out there and it's alright to think outside the box.  It also helps that Hub and Garth have an infinite amount of spending cash which they use for indiscriminate purchases like a biplane and a docile lion that Walter adopts as his pet.  Director-writer Tim McCanlies has crafted here a film that is a true original suitable for the whole family.  The emotions it engenders are earned.  Duvall and Caine are incapable of giving a bad performance and seem to relish the opportunity presented here to work together.  The positive example rubs off on young Osment and he more than holds his own with his superiors.  My sister raved this film to me and I'm wholeheartedly in agreement with her opinion.,1398902400,5,1039,4.836158192090395

1962843,5,B0000YTP02,"This movie is based on real life. It's shown through the eyes of a boy whose mom finds him inconvenient and parks him with her two great uncles for the summer.

The uncles are amazing, and don't want a kid, even for the summer. But they take care of him, and form the most amazing, strange family, ever.

This is a great movie to sooth you when you've had too much action/adventure in your own life. The uncles shoot at traveling salesmen, but they're good shots, and never actually hit anyone. There is action/adventure, but it's all done in a way that's safe for the audience. This is a great movie for your kids, and you won't be bored watching along with them.",1398816000,,664,4.390243902439025

It's great for all ages from children to older folks and everyone in between, men and women alike.  It has a great story line and keeps your interest from beginning to end. There is a little drama/mystery/action while being funny and heart-warming all at the same time.  Robert Duvall and Michael Caine do a fantastic job in their roles as two old-codger uncles to Walter, who has been abandoned by his mother on their run-down farm for the summer.

1962872,5,B0000YTP02,I love this movie and it's great for kids. I love all the actors in this and the stories. I especially love the scene when the younger guys get into the fight with Robert Duvall.

1962874,4,B0000YTP02,"I can't say the Haley Joel Osment is the greatest actor in this, but I guess he plays an exptremely akward kid ok.  Of course, Michael Caine and Robert Duvall make the movie. Their fun banter and croctchety old man-ness is just plain fun.  I hope to be an old curmudgeon like them some day.",1398211200,,290,4.254545454545455

1962877,5,B0000YTP02,"Two veteran actors that with a look out act a majority of today's so-called superstars, that give meaning in the film of all those aspects us ""old folk"" that have lived our lives OUR way.
The film speaks to those basic values some can keep, and it is our job to teach them to those that will listen.  A film that says you do NOT have to follow the rules of age and the expectations stereo-typed by a ""grandpa"".
Not the film for those that wish to teach their children conformance and the resulting mediocrity, but with dreams, and the knowledge they can persevere, they can go on, through adversity and become and do, and BE--no matter the beginnings--to grasp LIFE and hold it with both hands.
To Live Well, and be Well-Remembered at the End of it All,
All this, I found in this film, and would recommend it to anyone that is now in their so-called ""declining years"" and being pushed into the ""old people"" bin.",1397260800,,911,4.4226190476190474

1962879,5,B0000YTP02,"This is a tear jerker I have to have 10 tissues when ever I watch it because the main character in this movie reminds me of my beloved Uncle who passed away in 1995. He was a real mans man and knew how to do everything, He was not afraid of anything. He had been a good man and what he said he would do he did it, I have yet to meet such another man like him.
So getting back to the character of Robert Duvall I just start crying. He was a no nonsense guy and he was strong and took care of those who were out of line and had a good influence on the boy. This movie is such that I watch it but the same thing happens to me each time I watch it. It is a sobbing good time for me it is like walking down memory lane and into the past.
Top notch movie the boy was so lucky to be left with his uncles and to be raised by them too.

There is not so much a suicide at the end of the movie, but deaths that result from recklessness in old age.

The older cars are awesome, and the story is funny, and sad.  The nephew's mother leaves more to be desired for me.  Overall it's a good funny movie.",1395273600,,402,4.2368421052631575

I'll leave plot description to others but remind you that when Academy Award winners Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are in a well-written, well-performed movie like this one, everyone will have a great time. Adults and kids can watch this movie together, laugh, cry, and maybe start some discussions on what is truly important in life.

1963064,5,B0000YTP02,"I consider this the best film ever made.  This is because: there is nothing to offend anybody in this film [some will try a false argument that it's against a religion; but it's not, no religion is ever mentioned, and 'who?' is the only woman that Uncle Hubb ever loved?]  BUT vegans may be offended.  It has a great cast, director, film crew, story/plot, characterization, ...
  A nice kid, whose mother is always complicating their lives by find inferior suitors, gets dumped off at 'the long lost uncle's ranch for the summer.  They don't want him there but take pity on him [Walter] because they see his mother's true colors.
  Somehow, these two uncles have acquired quite a bit of wealth- over the years- and there are different family members that want to have it.  This creates conflict for Walter, not to mention that his mother has told him to search the ranch for the uncle's money.  None of the relatives are sure how the uncles got the money so there is a great deal of speculation.  This allows us to view Walter's imagination along with the slow unveiling by the uncles. We get to see Walter develop into a man  from the timid boy he arrived as.  The story is top of the line with many little diversions to add spice- The lion, the traveling salesman, the punks, the garden, the BBQ/ steak house, ...
  Who would like this film?  The young, the very young, the old, the adults, the parents, and probably even whinny teens.  Because of 'offending nobody' this film's only rivals [and they all fall- slightly- short] are: ""Big"", ""A Christmas Story"", ""home Alone"", ""Shreck"", and I'll stop with, ""The incredibles"".
  This is not my favorite movie but when speaking, with others, I will not say any film is better -unless we're speaking about specifics: F/X props, Action,  ..  [But ""Second Hand Lions"" has no need for those]",1387756800,,1835,4.636645962732919

1963115,5,B0000YTP02,"**DVD Review: November 3, 2013
We bought the $3.99 Prime widescreen DVD and have enjoyed it so much that we have watched it 4 times...and will surely watch it some more.  It's good, clean, ""feel-good"" entertainment. Some of it is hokey for sure but the cast makes it delightful. Of course Cain and Duval are good but the boy ""Walter"" is great too...as are most of the supporting cast.

BUT...Amazon describes it as a 2-disk set but it's only one disk. The disk itself shows bonus material (deleted scenes, etc.) on the menu but there is none. The disk is marked ""Disk 1"" so you might expect two, eh? We returned the first but Amazon said they could not replace it for whatever reason (It is sold and fulfilled by Amazon). So we ordered another. Same thing...only one disk.  I suspect it was some kind of special purchase of disk #1 because there is not typical ""seal"" on the package. It is wrapped and obviously new and plays fine.

For $3.99 shipped free with Prime (we love Prime) it's still a good deal and I highly recommend Secondhand Lions if you like pleasant, clean entertainment.

**Blu-ray Review: 01-28-2014
The BD version for about $7.00 DOES contain some very good bonus material, even though the product description says it doesn't (Amazon ??? What gives?)
Anyway we really like the movie and wanted the extra material which includes 3 featurettes:
1. One Screenplay's Wild Ride...
2. On the Set...with all the actors, animals, etc.
3. H.J. Osment: And Actor Comes of Age.
All very interesting.
Also ""Visual Effects"" and trailers.
The bonus material is well worth the $7 and now we have it in Blu-ray.",1383436800,,1615,4.692579505300353

Cannot believe we missed this at the theaters.",1381449600,2,237,4.7317073170731705
1963133,1,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions"" joins ""Kiss Me, Stupid"", ""Field of Dreams"", and ""Crash"" as one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's a handsomely produced, technically well-directed, piece of nitwit garbage.

I'm not sure why I bought it. The presence of Caine and Duvall was an enticement -- why would they associate themselves with a bad film? I'd forgotten they're the thespic equivalent of Superman -- no matter how poor the film, they walk away unscathed. I'd also forgotten that a story can look fine on paper, but be ruined by the time it reaches the screen. And I stupidly chose to ignore the Film Advisory Board ""Award of Excellence"" badge on the box. It's the kiss of death, as it's almost always ""awarded"" to atrocious ""family"" films. (You might want to read the Wikipedia article about this organization. Its claim that it doesn't ""review"" films is hypocritical, at best.)

Problems abound, but the principal one is that ""Secondhand Lions"" can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama. It starts off as the former, geared toward what a dull seven-year-old would find amusing. Walter's mother is a ludicrous caricature of ""the bad mother"" in children's books, atrociously played by Kyra Sedgewick. Her cousins are even less-believable, with two of the children looking like they escaped from a Charles Addams cartoon.

Haley Joel Osment gives a potentially career-killing performance, though he can hardly be blamed for an erratic script and (apparent) lack of guidance from the director. (The director penned the script, as well as such unforgettable masterpieces as ""Dennis the Menace Strikes Again!"".)

The story is basically a serious one, about a youngster coming to grips with having an incompetent mother and no father, and deciding what he wants to do with his life. The failure to establish and maintain an appropriate approach to this story is fatal. By the time we reach the ""serious"" scene between Duvall and Osment, we simply don't believe it. Worse, Caine's and Duvall's preposterous backstory turns out to be //true//, further diminishing any willingness to believe the rest of the tale. When Sedgewick's new boyfriend starts beating Osment, the disconnect with the rest of the film shows just how little the director knows about telling a believable story the viewer can relate to (or at least understand). And when you think the story has gotten as stupid as it possibly can, it amazes you with an idiotic attempt at a lethal (but ""comic"") plane crash climax.

If this review seems incoherent, it's because ""Secondhand Lions"" is so frighteningly bad, in so many ways, that it's difficult to express one's thoughts in a well-organized manner. (It needs a scene-by-scene critique, which neither you nor I have time for.) ""Secondhand Lions"" could have been a charming and affecting -- and humorous (where appropriate) -- story about a boy's coming of age. It is instead artistic trash, aimed at the lowest emotional and intellectual level of viewers.

PS: I just took a look at Roger Ebett's review. Even after his passing, Ebert remains my favorite reviewer, because whether or not you agree with him, he usually has something insightful to say. Not in this case. Ebert was bamboozled into seeing what the director /wanted/ to show, rather than what the film is actually about. It is a wretchedly bad film, and You Have Been Warned.",1381363200,4,3356,4.983928571428572

1963253,5,B0000YTP02,"I have to admit, I was skeptical when I first watched this movie.  I had little to no idea what it was about (there wasn't a great deal of promotion for it if I remember correctly), and I'm not the biggest fan of Haley Joel Osment.  I do love seeing Michael Caine work his acting chops, however, and the movie was recommended to me by a family member, so I decided to give it a shot.  And in the end, I'm so glad I did, because this is one of the best live-action family films of the '00s.

How to describe this movie?  Think of it as ""Grumpy Old Men"" meets ""The Princess Bride,"" with a dash of ""Stand By Me"" -- the hilarity of two old codgers butting heads with everyone around them and each other combined with an epic Arabian-style adventure of sheiks, princesses, and treasure, topped off with a thoughtful coming-of-age story.

Set in the early 1960s, the movie follows Walter (Osment), a quiet, bookish boy who's not at all pleased to be dumped in the care of his ornery great-uncles for the summer while his floozy mother goes off to party.  Said uncles, Garth and Hub, can most charitably be described as eccentric -- their idea of a good time is shooting at traveling salesmen, catfish fishing with shotguns, and buying a lion for target practice (though said lion ends up being too old and lazy to shoot and ends up becoming a pet for Walter).  Despite a rocky start, Walter and his uncles begin to warm to each other, and Walter finds himself caught up in their various escapades and misadventures.  And when Garth begins to tell Walter the story of their past -- a story of being shanghaied by the French Foreign Legion and becoming swept up in an epic adventure in North Africa and Arabia -- Walter begins to learn some important truths about his life... about what it takes to become a man, and on the importance of finding something to believe in.

The film has a rather leisurely pace, which might be annoying to fans of more action-packed films like ""The Avengers"" or ""Transformers.""  But this works to the films advantage, letting events and characters unfold and develop rather than rushing things for the sake of plot.  The film has a timeless, classic feel despite the 50's-60's-ish setting, and even modern viewers are sure to find something to relate to.  And the flashbacks to Garth and Hub's African adventures have the feel of an epic serial adventure, almost like ""Indiana Jones"" or the aforementioned ""Princess Bride.""  The juxtaposition of mid-century Texas and turn-of-the-century Africa/Arabia could have clashed horribly, but somehow the transitions between times are clear without being jarring, and there's no drop in quality between scenes either.

The acting in this film is superb as well.  Osment has drawn some criticism due to the fact that he was going through puberty at the time of filming (you can even hear his voice cracking several times), but this just adds to the realism -- he comes across as a boy on the cusp of his transition to adulthood, searching for some stability in his tumultuous life.  Given that most ""teenagers"" in modern films are just twenty-somethings with young-looking faces, I appreciated this bit of realism.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall both do fantastic jobs as the cantankerous uncles, with Duvall the gruffer of the two and Caine somewhat more laid-back but still not one to mess with or underestimate.  Most of the other characters are minor at best, but they all do excellent jobs in their roles and bring their characters to life.  (The sole exception being a child actor at the very end of the film, but I tend to cut young children just a bit of slack when it comes to acting...)

The DVD of the film comes with a slew of deleted scenes as well.  Most of these would have detracted from the film had they been included, and I agree with the decision to cut them (the ""Santa Robbers"" subplot was rather silly and unnecessary).  But the extended ""corn-harvesting"" scene was funny enough that I wish it had been included in the film proper, and I actually like the alternate ending better -- it tied up various plot threads more neatly, and gave more closure to the story of Walt, Garth, and Hub.  Still, at least the alternate ending is viewable for those who wish to see it, instead of permanently relegated to the cutting room floor.

A wonderful family film, with equal parts coming-of-age drama and epic adventure that should please fans of ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""Grumpy Old Men.""  Best for ages 8 and up due to some violent (but bloodless) sequences and some mild language.",1373500800,,4578,4.662935323383085

1963293,5,B0000YTP02,"'It was my cousin Rick, a gifted musician who plays at Bill's, who suggested that we watch ""Secondhand Lions"" last summer when you asked about this movie yesterday.  It stars Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, and takes place in Texas in the summer of 1962.  They play the part of two bachelor brothers who have retired on their broken-down ranch when their 14 year-old great nephew (Haley Joel Osment of ""The Sixth Sense"") comes to stay for the summer. If ever you were shipped off to unknown relatives at that vulnerable age, you may relate to this in some way.  Call it a hit-or-miss proposition if you will..'

Moving along, one might say that ""Secondhand Lions"" has a pride of four:  the two lions in the elderly Hub and his brother Garth, both now retired from active duty and shooting the breeze; one lion cub in the form of their nephew, Walter, and last but not least, the old and mangy Jasmine, the lioness in this story.

When Walter gets dropped off by his lost and desperate mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgewick), to spend the summer with his great-uncles, they are not too excited about this, nor is Walter.  In addition, he has been given instructions by his frantic mom to get into the good graces of these strangers with a view to becoming their inheritor.  Walter has no interest, or intention of doing this.  In the meantime, the rest of his distant scattered family are aware that these elderly bachelors have a fortune stashed away somewhere on their property.  It's not long before these 'vultures' start showing up for a friendly family visit.  Walter, in turn, decides to leave and manages to locate a phone booth to contact his mother, only to find out that once again she lied to him, and he doesn't know where she is.

Disheartened, he returns on the dusty road to his uncles' place and prepares himself for a long tedious summer. While trying to adapt and get used to the wild antics of these elderly men (at times it is Walter who proves to be the more mature of the three), he finds himself surrounded in their rambling shack by their pet pig and numerous dogs, and doesn't quite know what to do with himself.  No peers, no television, nothing really to do at all, except to wait it out and hoof it for the duration of his stay.

Reliving their youth and past adventures, the two men come up with the crazy idea of getting a lion for sport, only to find out with disgust that they've been sold a toothless and tame lioness from a circus.  Walter is enchanted by her, and calls her Jasmine after finding in his attic room a photo of a beautiful woman, the love of Hub's life with the same name. Hub feels slightly pained by a revival of these memories, but he's not going to allow this new Jasmine to starve, and while trying to handle heavy pounds of dry chow, he ends up in the hospital for a short stay.  When Garth and Walter bring him home, they stop at a local grimy eating hole and a gang of bored young punks decide to make trouble, switch-blades and all.  Garth slowly stands up and reveals his rifle.  His brother waves him aside, and here unravels quite a show-down between Hub and these thugs.  Walter watches anxiously the lesson his uncle chooses to give them while carefully taking in his message.

When they get home, Jasmine has accidentally been released from her crate by the relatives who left, and delighted by her freedom at last, the old lioness has wandered off and made a restful jungle patch for herself in their cornfield.  And then, the heart of the movie begins:

It is Garth first who tells Walter about his earlier life with his brother when they were young men.  A fascinating story of courage and adversity, laced with pragmatism and depicted for the viewers, he emphasizes the bond between siblings and when Walter wishes to hear more, Garth replies that he will have to ask Hub for his story and in his own way.  Hub's version is a bit of a wonderful fairy tale, somewhat reminiscent of an enchanted Arabian Night and a profound love story (the viewers also watch this unraveling on the screen in the telling).

But perhaps the highlight of the movie is when Walter who has been lied to so often, calls Hub on whether this is just another bunch of tall tales.  Hub becomes somewhat stern and gives his young nephew a brief speech about 'The Truth and What Every Boy Needs to Know'.  And, when Walter's mother returns with a slimy and dangerous boyfriend to pick up her 'property', or young son, more action begins until it reaches a satisfying conclusion.

A coming-of-age story, the first important choice that one has to make in life, the courage of 'Lions' where even Jasmine the lioness goes on to prove herself in a final splash of glory? All of the above perhaps for some of the viewers while implausible for others.  While we may be watching a tale of discounted lions, once a lion always a lion, and Walter may end up to be the greatest one of them all.  This may be a small forgotten movie, but it has a lot of heart, humor and some timeless messages and reminders for a majority of ages.  A fine summer rental and this one for Jeff, a lion today in Texas.",1370131200,5,5118,4.482758620689655

1963311,5,B0000YTP02,"Taking place in the early 1960s, this story is a delightful and unlikely romp through youth and old age as a young teen is taken in by his two aging uncles. They've retired from the Foreign Legion after two world wars and have settled in on the family farm in  Texas to live out their twilight years. Rumor has it they're loaded with cash, and all the shirttail relatives want it.
  One uncle is silent, and the other garrulous. The boy hears stories (with very entertaining illustrations) about their swashbuckling past and learns about what is required of a man.
  Great humor and full of unconventionally funny situations.
  I'll wear the DVD out.",1368835200,,650,4.699115044247788

Their retirement years are disrupted when their niece dumps her son on them for the summer.

No Digital for me, but still sounded nice. Good cast & a good Family movie that you can watch over & over again & feel good each time you see it.

But the important part? This movie is good enough that it overcomes his presence. When watching, one soon forgets his distracting presence and settles in for a solidly told tale.

If you started out liking, or at least not minding, Haley Joel Osment - well then, so much the better, I suppose.

One of the best movies of our time, period. A light hearted epic; moments of whimsy mixed with solid story telling in such a way that it almost has a ""Princess Bride"" feeling to it. Give it a shot; you won't be sorry.",1367107200,,595,4.342342342342342

To deny yourself a movie without in your face sex, violence and language as too simplistic think again.  Nice layers of complicated family ties, aging, and the role of myths in real life (ok that last one might just be me).

1963339,5,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions"" is a very enjoyable and well acted ""feel good"" family flick. This is one of those movies that can be put on when no one can agree on what to watch and everyone will be happy with the choice.

No plot spoilers from me: The story follows Walter (Haley Osment) as he is more or less discarded by his man-chasing mother (Kyra Sedgwick) with two eccentric and supposedly wealthy uncles (wonderfully cast Robert Duvall and Michael Caine). This could be considered a ""coming of age"" movie, but it really just flows nicely as a mostly entertaining comedy with some very touching and moving scenes.

We enjoy this movie and have watched it several times over the years as we introduce it to other people that haven't had the pleasure of seeing it.

Highly Recommended!

It is superbly cast with the unlikely pairing of Robert Duvall and Michael Caine as the uncles, Haley Joel Osmont as Walter, and a cameo by Kyra Sedgwick as the wanton mother. Its light heartedness and quick pace, a lot of it fueled by the antics of the uncles, keeps you glued to the screen to see what comes next. The ending is a treat of its own.

1963391,4,B0000YTP02,"A tennis buddy recommended this movie and I found it a fun diversion.

The acting of course is above average with Duvall and Walken. The story is a male fairy tale centered around a boy who is shunted off to a farm in the countryside to live with two old cantankerous uncles, who his mom tells him have a fortune hidden somewhere in the old ragged farmhouse the three share. His job is to find the loot.

But they are so full of fun and full of tales of past exploits; and are both determined to either live on having fun, or go out with a bang that the boy forgets all about the money and just enjoys their company and advice. Somehow, the uncles manage to accomplish both of their goals: They buy a lion and a ocean liner which they park in the fields where there is no water for hundreds of miles; they build themselves a two-seater plane and find a way to go out in style. Five stars. Sweet and harmless. Four Stars",1361577600,,919,4.186440677966102

1963395,4,B0000YTP02,"Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are Hollywood legends, who prove their reputation in Secondhand Lions. It's kind of a hokie story that really only works because of its extremely talented cast. Walter is sent to spend the summer with two bizarre and distant relatives, who mysteriously left forty years earlier to travel the world, and whom returned just as mysteriously. Like I said, the story is a bit weird, but it's extremely entertaining. The whole cast is terrific and the film is much more than what it appears to be on the outside. It's about living your life to the fullest and believing in whatever it is that makes you happy. It's a story everyone can relate to, with a cast I can't say enough about.",1361491200,,710,4.642857142857143

His acting still shines in this story of two ole men who are basically filling time waiting to die.

It is a true gem in which the two stars, Robert Duval and Michael Caine, seem to be having a good time putting together this good time for all viewers.  As crafty and crusty great uncles to a dropped off grand nephew, played by a young actor who keeps pace with them, this is a delightful film that manages to include romance, coming of age, derring do, and splendid eccentricity in its frame.  It knows just when to stop so that the viewer will be satisfied and wishing for more.  Duval and Caine are a treat as an aging Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer riding the raft of this highly enjoyable movie.

1963571,5,B0000YTP02,"I just watched Secondhand Lions for about the sixth time, and if it aired again today, I would probably watch it again.  I love what this movie conveys... a world where modern life and technology barely exists, and sappy right-and-wrong ideals mean more than being cool or owning things.  It is told by a couple of great actors, Duval and Caine, with a super performance by a talented young Haley Joel Osment, who plays their nephew Walter.

It is actually several stories layered together with a theme revolving around a couple of old men who have come (or perhaps returned) to the remote desolation of Texas to live out their final years.  Rumors abound in the community and family about these eccentric bachelors who keep to themselves, including speculation that they were bank robbers or other nefarious hooligans who now were hiding out with their ill-gotten gains.

The old brothers have little use for the snooty relatives, who are just hovering around waiting for them to die so they can get the money, or for anyone else, including Walter's mother, who they know just dumped the kid on them so she could buzz off to Vegas in search of some new boyfriend.

The story is of the kid, how he reacts to being abandoned with these crazy old geezers, and how he gets used to them and they get used to him.  They become family.  Walter undergoes profound life lessons at the hands of the wizened old men, and becomes a man as a result.

And, you will choke back a tear at the very end when the grown-up Walter says, ""Yes, they really LIVED.""",1353801600,,1543,4.581818181818182

The uncles are one level of second hand lions, but there is another, real life second hand lion shipped in to provide target practice for the uncles.

1963601,5,B0000YTP02,"When people talk about movie magic, Second Hand Lions is what they mean. This is a nearly perfect movie.

As a fan of small scale character driven stories; this is that kind of movie. There is much more. It has heart, it has mystery, it has action, and it has humor. Playing to my sensitivities; it is never over the top maudlin, and it treats you as an intelligent person.

Short plot summation:
Bachelor brothers Hub (Robert Duval) and Garth (Michael Caine) live secluded retired lives in some remote part of Texas. It is the early 1960's. Their main form of entertainment is to send traveling salesmen scampering away dodging shotgun fire. One day one of their nieces Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) dumps her son Walter (Hayley Osment) on the two men as she follows whatever new dead-end scheme she thinks will bring her life under control.

All the two men have to offer is the kind of stability the boy has never experienced and a chance for the boy to be exposed to a seriously male universal view. Walter, and through him, the rest of us learn these two old men have a story to tell. Walter seems to understand that the elaborate story is something they made up and expects it to follow the classical path of all such stories.

Along the way there is a real Africa Lioness - if somewhat old and used, some money grubbing relatives and an even slower reveal that the brothers may have a real story to tell. So where did all that money come from? Who was the real Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugler)? And just how did that one salesman get through?

Underneath this is a movie about story telling. It is a movie about seeing past surfaces and about ""The speech every man should hear"".  What is most important is that none of this deeper stuff matters. It is entertaining and uplifting. Again playing to my preferences, the up lift does not hammer you down. It flows naturally out of the story line.

Duval and Caine play off each other as naturally as if they had been boys together. If you are a fan of acting, this by-play more than covers the few dollars for this disk. Some reviews have taken issue with Haley Osment. I liked his performance. His movie age has to be prepubescent, but also old enough to have some mature insight. Given that Walter has had to be the adult around his mother, the fact that the brothers give him the chance to be a child has to come through. This is a complex assignment. Haley handles it.

This review may already be too long. Over analysis can mean that there are complex things to understand before you can enjoy. Enjoy Second hand Lions, stuff the analysis. All you need to know is:
One of the best family movies ever

I was channel surfing in the kiddie pond when this gem came up.  As the plot went on I turned my bored into a growing wave of what we all need at times- high adventure, unanticipated humor - the kind when your best friend says something that makes you laugh ten years later- and a story that you want a sequel too, but stands alone.

We choose our friend's and not family.  Aside from the ""don't you miss growing up/ old without a bicycle helment"" theme, it was great to talk with my living Uncles and thank them for fishing trips without dynamite,

They had some great stories.  New Mexico Uncle Bill was in NASA and tested the rockets for Apollo !!,  Alaska Uncle Jim fought off a kodiak bear just before meeting the love of his life, California Uncle Bob was a young Marine at the Chosin Reservoir, Colorado Aunt May told me about Walton who manned-up a left waist gun in a B-17...",1349568000,,1053,4.396907216494846

I rented this movie but will probably buy it so that I can watch it again and again and have it to share.  My sister bought this movie and also loved it.

It gives such a wonderful picture of the power of choice and what family is really about.  The title doesn't even make sense until 2/3 of the way through the film.  The ""heroes"" in the story have all been rejected in a powerful way and yet dispite themselves are able to choose life and love.
This movie is about triumph with no nudity, vile language, raging violence or hate.  I could watch this once a week!",1349395200,,547,4.323529411764706

The building of relationships between a boy that no one wanted and two old uncles is both touching and hilarious.  There are so many wonderful moments I don't want to spoil the fun for you.  In the end, the old uncles teach Haley (and others) how to be a good man and how to live life with gusto and honesty.  A must see (although you don't need the hurricane to enjoy it!)",1349308800,,504,4.164948453608248

1963618,5,B0000YTP02,"My sister sent me this DVD of ""Secondhand Lions"" as a gift. Immediately upon viewing, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. This is first-class all the way. Osment, Caine, and DuVall absolutely sparkle. Robert DuVall should have been Oscar-nominated....and won. Brilliant performance. For that matter, Osment and Caine also should have been similarly honored. (At the risk of sounding trivial, even the farmyard resident animals are terrific performers...cute as can be! This speaks volumes about the quality and care the director and team put into this opus.). The picture and sound are first rate....wide screen AND full screen versions included, plus trailer as well as a premium quality thoughtful director's commentary. Great movies are about relationships among the characters. This wonderful family movie is one of those films. A classic. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! It is only because this film is of such pristine quality that I take the time to add my review to the hundreds who already have praised it. (My DVD is a single disc....the product description here says 2 discs...perhaps a typo...or packaging update.  In any event, I'd purchase without hesitation, gather the family, and enjoy!)",1348790400,,1202,5.326315789473684

With 3 great stars it is not necessary to say how great the acting was, but I will anyway, they were all 3 terrific. If you are looking for a lighthearted movie with comedy and a little sadness, a movie that leaves you feeling good at the end, then you will enjoy this movie.
Robert DuVall did some really great deadpan comedy here, so ask me why he was not even listed on Amazon as one of the main characters.??? Haley Joel Osment was terrific and so was Michael Caine.
I wish Hollywood would put out more of this type of movie.",1346889600,2,684,4.074074074074074

1963647,2,B0000YTP02,"Consummate actors Michael Cain and Robert Duvall are the only thing appealing about this movie, sadly. They are adorably likeable, gruff and ornery, and have a great chemistry together. The farm on which they live is just like them; old, run-down, ugly, but oddly endearing. We also get the treat of seeing Kyra Sedgewick doing a brilliantly ditzy, self-centered mother; she surprised and delighted me with her role!

Unfortunately, that's where the appeal ended for me. The producers so obviously hoped they could squeeze out one last ""cute little kid"" role for Haley Joel Osment... but his adolescent presence is so blatantly out of place. He's a budding teenager, not a cute little bumpkin, and he over-acts the entire role, trying to be a wide-eyed, adorable child (which of course, is all he ever was known for in the past)... and it falls SO flat.

The storyline is rambling and random, trying to be cute, sentimental, tear-jerking, even adventurous. It just turns into sort of a mess, and I can't decide if it's awful, sort of sweet in a pathetic way, or something in between.",1344556800,,1083,4.848648648648648

1963658,4,B0000YTP02,"Caine, Duvall, Osment, and Sedgwick are all excellent. The adult Osment character is a cartoonist and the illustrations by Berke Breathed's at the end were a delight. Also, in the extra on the making of the film, the director talks about having a lunch with John Sayles and Guillermo del Toro to discuss how to make a movie. That is a seminar I would like to see on DVD.

I think this film may resonate more with people who grew up in rural areas or small towns. My brother and I grew up in small town Nebraska. My brother saw it in the theater and was thinking it was pretty good when his wife said ""Well, that was a waste."" A friend who grew up in Indiana loaned this film to me and we both loved it but no one I know who grew up in cities or suburbs seems to have cared that much for it. There are so many moments in this film I fondly remember that I finally had to buy my own copy.

But once I got into it, I found it entrancing. I loved the early part of the movie when they were shooting at the salesmen who came calling, was touched by the lion who was given a chance to live out the remainder of his life in a better setting, and gladdened by this simple story of a young nephew changing the hearts of two old codgers.

My sisters and I were taken in by our grandparents when our mother couldn't keep her life together (abusive men, drifting), much like the character in this film.  I know I'm hardly the only person out there with this story, especially with so many teenagers becoming parents nowadays.  It was gratifying to see a film that accurately celebrated the family that could be had in this type of unconventional home.  It is a ""feel good"" movie and ""uplifting"" and all those other things most other reviews call it, but it's also painfully honest and that's what keeps it from being just another sappy kid's film to add to the pile.",1328140800,,780,4.464788732394366

Over the years, Robert Duvall evolved from character actor to one of the finest, most subtle lead actors in the business. He's great in this. Watching Michael Caine do a Texas accent was fun, too (he pulls it off). However, while Haley Joel Osment has an emotional scene or two that are convincing, overall this is probably his worst work.

I love the ending, and the portrayal of the grown-up boy by Josh Lucas.

This movie is inspiring for all ages: it shows that character really does matter; that you can find what you need in the last place you look; it shows that growing old doesn't mean you're any less spirited or, dare I say, cool.  Watch it to remind yourself that life is good, that it has meaning, and that growing old isn't growing less able - it's being able to share your unique strengths with another generation.",1320192000,2,932,4.578313253012048

They have more money than sense and are always making unusual purchases. The brothers have lived a very exciting past which is slowly revealed in flashbacks throughout the movie.  It took seeing the movie more than once before I realized where they got the title though it is very obvious.

Among her last admonitions to her son is to find out where his uncles keep their money--and despite their hermitous behavior, they do seem to have an unlimited supply of it, going so far as to order a live lion by mail in hopes of enjoying a hunt.  Slowly Walter is drawn more and more into the lives--past and present--of the two men, who seem to have either lived adventures that would suit any Errol Flynn character or to be, perhaps, successful bank robbers on the lam.  They're also thoroughgoing eccentrics who fish their stock pond with shotguns rather than rods and reels--and drive off an endless succession of travelling salesmen with the same weapons.  As the summer progresses, Walter and his uncles develop a genuine if unspoken fondness for each other, and when mama Mae returns with her latest light-o'-love, a private detective (Michael O'Neill) with an agenda of his own, a confrontation occurs that will change all their lives forever.  The movie is a little slow getting started, but eventually it becomes more interesting, and Hub and Garth are a wonderful pair of originals the truth about whom is kept uncertain until almost the very last minute.",1303171200,3,1442,4.917695473251029

I fell in love with the eccentric uncles, Robert Duvall and Michael Caine. Their unique approach to getting rid of unwanted traveling salesmen (using them for target practice was the highlight of their day) left me in stitches. Especially when their nephew (Haley Joel Osmet) clearly reacted to this as if he were certain that he had been given over to a couple of lunatics by his irresponsible mother.

But there is a solid core of decency in these men that gradually reveals itself to both Osmet and the audeince, and this solidity is something that Osmet desperately needs to form a foundation for the rest of his life.

Being unceremoniously dropped off at his uncles' door is the greatest gift that his mother could have ever given him.

As one might expect, the cast turns in marvelous performances that picks you up and carries you along as the adventures unfold. Michael Caine as Garth, and Robert Duval as Hub play the parts of two rather mysterious, eccentric uncles who have a nephew, played by Haley Joel Osment, who is unwillingly thrust into their lives.

This is the story of their developing love and respect for each other told in a manner guaranteed to charm the watcher.

1963771,5,B0000YTP02,"SOME SPOILERS

I admit it. I cried at the end of SECONDHAND LIONS. This warm and amazingly touching story struck a deep chord inside me. In terms of ""Family Values"" this film is exemplary.

Young Walter (later ""Walt"") is a boy on the verge of becoming a man in 1962 Texas. His sweet but careless and flighty mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) has a long history of dropping him off ""for two weeks or a month or two or three months"" with relatives or at orphanages while she pursues her own life's dreams, which boil down to mostly finding a husband (employment status unimportant; criminal record expected; domestic violence unavoidable).

Having run out of siblings and Sisters of Mercy, Mae takes Walter to spend the summer with her two great-uncles, Hub (Robert Duval) and Garth (Michael Caine). When Walt arrives the two old men are sitting on the front porch of their falling-down house, shotguns at the ready, waiting for traveling salesmen. They accept ""the kid"" without comment, wave off his inquiries about TV and telephones, and commence shooting at every widget salesman that pulls up to the door. Walt is terrified, and tries to run off, only to discover that Mae has lied to him yet again regarding her whereabouts. Defeated, he returns to Hub and Garth, who, much to their credit, welcome him back and treat him not as a child or an unwanted houseguest, but as an equal.

Walt awakens one night to find Hub armed with a plunger, swordfighting in his sleep. Used by now to the unexpected from his eccentric uncles, bemused but not afraid, he inquires of Garth exactly what is going on. Garth begins to spin a fantastical tall tale of the two brothers joining the Foreign Legion and fighting the Sheiks of Araby. In colorful, entertaining, action-packed sequences, the details of Garth's stories are played out in Walt's mind.

As the stories unfold, Walt learns that his uncles are fabulously wealthy men who traversed the world in search of adventure in their young years, but now they're ""all used up."" Walt discovers that Hub has loved and lost his wife, the beautiful Arabian princess, Jasmine, and that his heart is forever broken.

As Hub and Garth unlock Walter's imagination his own buoyant energy revitalizes them. At first they keep it within bounds. They start a vegetable garden. They stop shooting at visitors. Then their long-dormant madcap energy takes over. They buy a secondhand lion from the circus as a pet for ""the kid"" (he names her ""Jasmine""). Hub purchases an old biplane (neither brother is a licensed pilot). After Hub singlehandedly fights off a pack of hoodlums, he gives them his famous, ""What Every Boy Needs To Know About Becoming A Man"" speech. They go off, chastened. Walt, who misses the moment, makes his uncle swear to live long enough to give him the speech. The stories continue, wonderful stories full of honor and bravery, and loyalty and love. Are they true?  They don't have to be true in order for us to believe them.

We never actually hear ""The Speech"" itself, but SECONDHAND LIONS is the speech personified---Simply this:  ""REALLY Live.""

Amazingly, as the ""Extras"" tell us, SECONDHAND LIONS took over ten years to be produced. Screenwriter/Director Tim McCanlies based this story on his own life growing up in Texas, not so much in fact, as in sensibility. McCanlies, who lost his own father at a young age, crafted this coming-of-age film as a heartfelt expression of what older mentors can teach to younger men.

1963781,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions is an excellent film; the acting is nothing short of first rate and the casting was very thoughtfully done. The plot moves along at a very good pace. Indeed, I was never bored even though the adventure scenes and the ""message"" of the film with those old fashioned values are not exactly new ones. Look also for impressive cinematography and choreography both of which serve to add a great deal of color to this motion picture. In addition, the script was well written.

When the film begins, we meet Walter (Haley Joel Osment) who is essentially being dumped for the summer by his irresponsible mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) at the dilapidated old home where two of Mae's uncles live. Mae's uncles Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine) have quite a reputation: Rumor has it that they have stashed away a huge fortune and the other rumors of just how they got that money range from winning a lawsuit after being in a psychiatric hospital for forty years to their having led practically inexplicable, dangerous lives all over Europe and North Africa decades ago. In addition, Mae wants Walter to ingratiate himself to the older men so that she can get her hands on their money really, really fast--after her summer fling with yet another abusive boyfriend is over, that is.

It isn't easy for the shy boy Walter to adapt to the two uncles and their creaky, inhospitable old home. Walter tries to run away and contact his mother where she told him she'd be; but as usual Mae lied to him and now Walter is stuck spending the summer with Hub and Garth. However, it also isn't too long before Walter slowly forms a bond with the two cantankerous older men; and Walter learns more and more of their incredible past experiences as told to him mostly by Garth. It's fascinating to see their flashback through Walter's imagination while he listens to their stories.

But are these incredible stories of fighting sheiks with swords in North Africa and involvement in endless battles in the French Foreign Legion actually true? Walter understandably has his doubts and it isn't until the very end of the picture that the truth is definitively uncovered. Moreover, what about other greedy relatives including Helen (Deirdre O'Connell) who want the rumored stash of money for themselves? They are determined to get their hands on that rumored to be true hidden huge stash of money!

In addition, look for good performances by Christian Kane as a young Hub; Kevin Haberer as a young Garth; Emmanuelle Vaugier as Princess Jasmine; Adam Ozturk as a Sheik who Garth says had quite a fight with a young Hub over Jasmine and Jace Pitre as the young teenager Frankie.

I liked the bonus on the first disc that has a running commentary with director Tim McCanlies. There is also a second DVD with nothing but wonderful bonus features on it.

Secondhand Lions is a good film despite the ever-so slightly-sappy flavor it can have at certain moments. There are many action and adventure scenes that held my attention every step of the way. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it and people who enjoy dramas and even coming of age stories will not be disappointed.",1275696000,2,3179,4.75

It might be viewed as a 'fluff' movie with most of the storyline a tale of fantasy, but I found it a great story filled with humor and fun. I enjoyed the concept of 'The Speech every Boy Needs to Hear Before he Becomes a Man' that Robert Duvall's character gave, and the whole salesman bit was just too funny.

1963814,3,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions""  is about shy young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to spend the summer with his eccentric uncles (Michael Caine, Robert Duvall) by his Mom (Kyra Sedgwick) so he can secretly discover the millions the old guys are reputed to be sitting on.  At first shocked by his uncles' unconventional behavior, which includes ordering African lions through the mail, the boy soon becomes enthralled with unraveling the mystery that has followed his uncles for years.  Hearing tales of their exotic adventures involving kidnapped princesses, Arabian shieks, and lost treasure not only brings him closer to his uncles but also teaches him what it means to believe in something, whether it's true or not.  Osment isn't much of an actor here, especially when he has to share the screen with pros Caine and Duvall.  The film never really convinces, but Caine and Duvall have fun with their outlandish roles.  Bonus extras include alternate scenes (including an alternate ending), three featurettes, director commentary, and deleted scenes.",1259366400,,1047,5.2395209580838324

It doesn't have all the blockbuster special effects one expects in this day and age but relies on good acting and a sweet storyline. I bought it several years ago when it first came out on DVD and have recommended it to a number of people since. It is a movie that can be watched by all ages; parents need not worry about content. Even my teenagers enjoyed this movie, as did their grandparents. While the plot is sometimes completely over the top, the actors are able to pull it off, making the unbelievable believable. One can even accept Michael Caine's attempt at a Texas accent.

The only problem I have with this movie is the ending. I won't post any spoilers, but the ending shown in the ""Deleted Scenes"" section was much more effective and, I will admit, brought out the kleenex.

Duval and Caine are at their typical low-key, understated best as two elderly brothers, fiercely independent recluses who have recently become wealthy and settled down in the country.  The ways they find to fend off salesman and obnoxious family members are hilarious.  And they have hearts of gold, really, especially to the small boy who comes to live with them.  The way in which the truth or fiction of the stories they tell him unfolds in an unexpected way.  I have seldom enjoyed a movie so much.

1963831,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions depicts desire for the freedom to live life to its fullest.  But, what if you are told that you are a nothing?  That you will never amount to anything?  You ignore those voices and look inward to your mind.  What do *you* want to do?  Invariably your choices require training, study,  philosophical values, and firm resolution.  This, in essence, is what Second hand Lions is about - i.e. the desire to stand firm and chose your paths in life.  Yes, paths choices are myriad and many.  Everyone faces path choices.  Some folks face and determine path choices while others ignore path choices and allow themselves to drift aimlessly.
Who are the Secondhand Lions?  Two men and an aged lion (yes, the lion also chooses and establishes her path) have developed moral values that seem questionable to the modern liberal mentality, but to the creature who values freedom - there can be no other path.
Sure some of the events seem far-fetched to the non-adventurous mentality, yet everything presented in Secondhand Lions is possible, including realization that every human possesses qualities to become a 'doer', or live life as a 'mooch'.",1243296000,2,1151,4.942708333333333

You can read a more complete summary of this movie at this product site, but here are some things that you might want to know if you are considering this product:

1) The two uncles use a smattering of mild foul language
2) There is gun play, but not to worry, no one is hurt, except perhaps some fish that live in the uncles' pond...you just have to watch and see about this
3) The uncles terrorize (part of the comic relief) traveling salesmen that make the poor choice of invading their privacy
4) There is laugh-out-loud humor in the show, as well as some drama, some melodrama, and some action
5) There is one brief scene of physical abuse, but it does not involve the uncles
6) If you are like me, you will particularly enjoy the melodramatic representations of the narrative flashbacks that appear as one of the uncles tells the boy of the uncles' adventures during 40 years before they returned to 1950s Texas

As far as I'm concerned this is an outstanding film that will almost certainly be enjoyed by everyone older than probably 8 or 10 yrs of age.

Some people may say that this movie is just too sappy to be very good, but in my opinion this a movie that should be a welcome addition to most any anyone's dvd collection.

Caine, Duvall, and Osmet all turn in great performances.

But even though they're eccentric, they don't allow the scam artists who think they can take advantage of them--there's a rumor the old guys have lots of money--to make them fair-pickin's.  They have shotguns and know how to use them!  They're really feisty old gents with a laid-back sense of humor.  The boy who's dropped off for the summer by his lame-brain mother is their nephew, and there's other relatives who are trying to get the so-called money the men have.  The boy really gets an education, hears the fascinating stories of their lives, and comes to love the old men.  There's so many unusual twists to this movie that you have to see it to appreciate the humor and the way the story deals with the fundamental issues of life for the young boy and the old men.

Two men who experienced the wold before the adventure was gone from it.  They led armies into battle, lived by a code of honor, fought for justice in a lawless land, and never gave up on each other.  At the end of their days and ready to die they are forced to foster their Great Nephew. What happen next is proof that you are never too old to live and it's never too late to try.

It is a good family film, light, a little corny, but a feel-good film. You leave the film just feeling good. So rare these days for family films. In fact, some ""family"" films really push the envelope of decency and appropriateness for the sake of ""appealing"" to the audience, instead of telling a darn good story. Even animated family films these days push it.

The story is a little fantastical - similar to ""Big Fish"" (2004) - and at times corny. But the corniness and the silliness makes the story light, enjoyable, and funny.

In the special features the original ending is available. The author/director offers reasons why he deleted the original ending and substituted the new ending. Well, he was wrong. As great a job as he did with the rest of the movie He blew it when he chose to change the ending. I have no problem accepting a change in actors because of an age change. It's still Walter! Especially considering what a great job Josh Lucas does of BEING the same character. Emotionally the original ending is vastly more powerful. The new ending is barely understandable, nearly meaningless pablum... While the original ending is a powerful summation of the drive, direction, meaning of this film. Director/Author McCandless castrated his own film when he switched endings.

1963894,5,B0000YTP02,"I've watched this movie several times and still love it. The basic story is of a boy, Walter (played by Haley Joel Osment) who is dumped on his great-uncles Garth and Hub (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) because his skanky, irresponsible mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick), is tired of being tied down by him. Garth and Hub aren't interested in Walter, and Walter seems, at first, to be a bit too beaten down by having an unloving mother to really care much.

But gradually Walter and his great-uncles start to get to know each other and to warm to each other. One of the things that helps is that the great-uncles seem to have led some very interesting and adventurous lives. They tell stories of things they did when they were younger (as each story is being told, the movie makes the transition from narration to showing the story unfold in live action). These stories are exciting and wonderful and all have core values about life very neatly underlying them.

One of the stories is that the great-uncles accumulated a vast amount of gold, though we don't know for sure whether it was acquired the way the great-uncles tell, or through a bank robbery. And it turns out that Mae, in addition to just getting rid of Walter for a while, was also hoping that Walter would find out where the money is hidden, and so she was coldly using him for that purpose.

When Walter finds out that it is possible that none of the stories are true, Hub tells him that it doesn't matter, giving a wonderful speech about love, honor, and goodness, and about how there are things worth believing in. (A brief excerpt: ""...That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that ... money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil...."" Wonderful stuff. I suppose the more cynical and heart-hardened might call this syrupy or even unbelievable, but I call it core values.)

I don't want to give anything more away about the story, but I assure you it is a wonderful, warm, human story, womderfully told with great acting on the part of all three major characters (Caine, Duvall, and Osment). I love this movie and hope you will too.",1214179200,,2156,4.650918635170604

1963896,4,B0000YTP02,"I gotta get out more.  I had never heard about this movie; never noticed it when it was playing in movie palaces.  Channel surfing the other night (and I can press buttons on a remote with the best of 'em) I ran across this intriguing little gem on cable.  Anything sporting Michael Caine and Robert Duvall (as brothers, if you can believe that) is worth watching; and SECONDHAND LIONS aptly entertains--even if the syrup is a bit sticky.

It's a plot that's been cooked before:  A pre-teen goes to stay with wacky, eccentric relatives.  Haley Joel Osment plays the adolescent, and when his manhunting momma dumps him on the doorstep of two great-uncles (Duvall and Caine), circa 1950s Texas boonies, the fun begins.  The brothers are alleged retired big game hunters and adventure seekers, yet the locals believe they are instead retired bank robbers--retired gents sitting on a vast stash of loot.  Predictably, as the story unfolds the once-terrified boy begins to appreciate his shotgun-toting elders; a lasting bond of affection, of family, develops.

Are there some drawbacks?  Sure.  The ""flashbacks"" of the brothers as adventuresome youths are cornpone supreme.  Haley Joel Osment is stiff, wooden, and uninspired; he looked like he wanted to split to the nearest Hannah Montana gig.  And the ending was. . .over the top.  (Yet very emotional.)  But come one.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall make this movie work, and work well; they bring believability, eccentricity, and big-time grit to their roles.  SECONDHAND LIONS may have scooted past me when it made its theatrical run, but I'm sure glad I caught it cable surfing, and recommend it to anyone looking for fun entertainment.

1963909,4,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions"" is a great inspirational movie for the entire family.  It is heartwarming and funny.  It teaches us that the best is yet to come.  Haley Joel Osment (the wonder boy actor from ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""A.I."") is dumped on his two eccentric, great uncles who live in the past.  They amaze the boy with stories of when they were forced into the French Foreign Legion and rescued a Princess from a Sheik.  How much of it is real and how much is exaggeration?

  Osment teaches his uncles that they still have a lot of living to do.  First of all, they are faced with ""fatherhood.""  They've been saddled with raising Osment.  Osment is the child that the uncles never had.  Duvall lost his wife and child during childbirth.  In a way, the uncles are Osment's secondhand fathers and he is their secondhand son.  Both men are aging lions who begin to experience life anew when Osment arrives.

  An old lion from a zoo arrives through the mail.  This is another secondhand lion that nobody wants.  But Osment wants him, just as he wants and needs his uncles.  Through the love of Osment, both the lion and the uncles become what they once were:  roaring lions, yearning to live life to the fullest.

  Osment eventually learns that the stories his uncles told him weren't as exaggerated as he had suspected and they really lived great lives.  This movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Big Fish"":  A grown man attempts to learn who is father really was while fearing
 that all his life stories have been lies.

  ""Secondhand Lions"" made me laugh and it made me cry.  It is an emotional rollercoaster ride that the entire family will cherish.  Watching it made me reflect on my own life.  I need to live it to the fullest and maybe someone will say of me, ""He died with his boots on.""",1209513600,2,1792,4.46583850931677

Michael Cain, who I enjoy watching act, does an excellent British/fake Southern accent.  While Bobby Duvall is at his superb best.  The post-hospital variety store punchfest is reminiscent of Lonesome Dove.

1963935,2,B0000YTP02,"Very perplexing the five star reviews. How much excitement can one garner from two old men, albeit brilliant actors in a movie in Texas during the 1960's, where most of the action takes place sitting on porch with a boy that barely looks capable of counting up to ten on his hands, and the efforts of all involved were that of idle banter, pitiful and unfunny interactions with each other and well, simply unmotivated and dull performances. If felt dry, unintoxicating, and not nostalgic, which I think it should have been. There was a tender moment or two, and fun seeing Josh Lucas, but in this reviewers opinion, I was not impressed at all.

Haley Joel is deplorable in this, and while I can easily see why families would enjoy this, I don't see teenagers for the most part finding this engaging in the least, or maybe I'm just a cynic, nay....

Haley Joel, as talented as he is? I mean is he? It is quite understood while this was being made he was in full throttle puberty and that certainly must have had a bearing as his craft went whooossssh out the window. An Oscar nod you would think would be some tell tale sign that the person has potential, but this performance does not do anyone justice. He looked sickly, pale and dried up.

1963947,1,B0000YTP02,"This is the ultimate fable of the Bush II administration. George W. [Dub] Bush (Robert Duvall) and Dick [Carp] Cheney (Michael Caine) are two extremely wealthy old-codger brothers who live on a dilapidated ranch in Texas. Joe Public (Haley Joe Osmet) has been left in their care by his criminally negligent self-centered mother, Hillary Clinton (Kyra Sedgwick). She wants Joe to work his way into Bush and Cheney's steely hearts so he (and thereby, she) can inherit their billions (or find out where it is hidden so they can steal it.). His first night on the ranch, Young Joe finds evidence of the precious princess Arabica Petrolea under a layer of desert sand at the bottom of an old travel trunk.

At first, the hard-nosed Dub doesn't want any part of Joe, ""I'm not cooking for you, You'll have to feed yourself."" Carp, though, is somewhat more thoughtful and caring.

Carp explains to Joe that long ago Dub had convinced their parents, H.W. and Barbara, to bankroll them to travel overseas to Europe to seek their fortunes. The brothers don't realize it at the time, but it's the eve of World War 1, and they are soon Shanghaied into the French Foreign Legion for duty in the Middle East. In close combat, Dub proves his bravery time and time again. Later, Dub leads tens of thousands of men into victorious battles throughout the newly-independent Arab lands. There, he meets and falls madly, passionately in love with Princess Arabica Petrolea (Emmanuelle Vaugier), the only woman he ever loved or (he vows) ever will.

As any fable would have it, Arabica is already promised as the umpteenth wife to an evil Arab sheik, Osaddama bin' Ridden, who already has a huge harem of much coveted beauties just like Princess Petrolea. Dub, liberates Petrolea from her greedy despotic master and in retaliation, and the sheik puts a price of ten thousand pieces of gold on our hero's head. Carp naturally decides to capitalize on the situation, and disguises himself as a bounty hunter and turns Dub in for the loot. Soon after, easily laying bloody waste to a half dozen Arab guards, Dub withdraws from the dungeon and redeploys himself in the heart of the palace, the sleeping sheik's bedouir. A short sword fight later leaves beardy Osaddama cowering on the floor. Magnanimous Dub tells the wretch, ""Twice I've held your life in my hands, and twice I have given it back to you; the next time, your life is mine."" This decisive show of strength wins the sheik's respect and the assassination attempts on Dub cease immediately. What's more, Osaddama gives his blessing and showers Dub and Petrolea with riches as a wedding present.

Dub Bush and his passion, Princess Arabica Petrolea live happily ever after, but not for long -sadly, Petrolea dies in childbirth without producing.

Hillary shows up with an abusive boyfriend, a private dick named Bill and tries to get Joe to spill the beans about where the cash is stashed. He knows, but keeps the secret even after Bill tries a few enhanced interrogation techniques. Later, Bill ends up listening to Dub's  ""what it means to be a man speech"" from inside a body cast.

But law is law and must be obeyed no matter how rich and powerful one (or two) is, and Hillary is the legal custodian of Joe. So Hillary, Bill and Joe drive off together. However, soon young Joe Public escapes by jumping out of the speeding car. He's not hurt badly and Hillary and Joe finally have a heart to heart in the middle of a bridge (possibly between right and wrong or maybe Right and Left.) Joe begs her to, please, just once, do what is best for him. And in a moment of weakness, strength or revelation, she relents and sends him running back to good ol' uncles Dub and Carp. And they all live happily ever after.

Years later, probably November 9, 2010, Joe gets a call from the county sheriff: uncles Dub Bush and Carp Cheney have died in an accident. Ol' Dub and Carp finally got that junk bi-plane up in the air, took a couple passes over the ranch and flew it upside down into a building, their own barn that still sat atop their fortune, killing both Dub and Carp instantly, painlessly. No towering inferno, no fire at all. No bodies dropping like rain.

Their lives were not for naught.  Thanks to the adventures of Dub and Carp, the Middle East is free, friendly, democratic, peaceful and prosperous and will continue to be so for at least the next two generations. For while Joe is reading his uncle's will at the crash site, a helicopter touches down and out steps the grandson and little great-grandson of Osaddama. Osaddama III and IV were in Texas on oil business and heard about the deaths on CNN, and {from Wikipedia} ""...and thought they might be the two courageous Americans that his grandfather (the sheik) had told him about long ago. Walter says that, yes, they were, and the two are happy to realize that the stories which had inspired them for so long were true-- that the two men ""really lived.""

So, there you have it. Tim Mc Canlies has done an excellent job of creating this multifaceted fable by seamlessly recounting the Bush II administration years inside out, opposite and in reverse chronological order. The only real glitch is that, in reality, no oil has ever been produced from Bush's adventure in Iraq. My guess is that since this movie came out in 2003, that Mc Canlies had predicted that great quantities of oil would flow to America, and to remain true to the `reverse mirror' structure, had Petrolea die without producing offspring. However, this is made up for with the trap-shooting scene, which actually prophesied Vice-President Cheney's 2006 peppering of a man's face with buckshot.",1183334400,4,5657,4.715587044534413

SECONDHAND LIONS, a title taken from a threadbare feline supporting actress, is a real sleeper.  A great screenplay, excellent cinematography and acting that is second to none make this film a must see and a must have.  Robert Duvall and Michael Caine star as the quirky old uncles about whom much is whispered.  Are they bank robbers on the lam?  Are they veterans of European and African adventures who get the loot and, in the case of one, get the girl? Are the stories true or are they the fabrications of two well-meaning, though unbalanced, old men?

And just when you thought that he had gone the way of so many child stars, Haley Joel Osment emerges as a refreshing and believable, though misfit, teen who loses himself and finds himself in the story that evolves in this classic.

While others in a similar age bracket might get their kicks from a rousing game of checkers, these lovable codgers wait for intrepid door-to-door salesmen to stop by - and then blast them with shotguns.  Sound improbable?  It is.  But this entire film exists in a parallel universe, a fun one to visit.

Secondhand Lions is not a great movie, Brazil is a great movie.  However, it is a wonderful movie.  A golden glow covers the cornfield, pond, and ramshackle farmhouse.  You know instantly that these scowling curmudgeons will grow to love young Walter, and that his presence in their lives will stir the soup in interesting ways.  The return of Walter's neglectful mother, with yet another wretched male, is equally predictable - and yet - it's satisfying when it arrives.  It isn't long before, rather than feeling sad for poor Walter, dumped on the doorstep of these misanthropes, we come to envy him.

This movie concludes with what might be described as magic realism.  But by then, it is far too late; you are already in love with all the key players.  Never before has stunt flying been quite so dramatic!  As the exotic inhabitants of the storied past begin to appear, thereby validating the fantastic stories no little boy in his right mind would dare to believe, one is tempted to ask - what is more remarkable, fighting in the French Foreign Legion, or being abandoned by your mother and learning about love and compassion from two anti-social grizzlies who rock on the porch all day with shotguns resting in their laps?

In the case of two brothers, living back on the land, and having a younger generation relative take a look-see at their lives by living with them, at first blush, they have had adventureous lives.  But then other people, some with their own ideas can sometime make you begin to disbelieve your own notions about what you believe that person to be.  And isn't it great when what you believed all along might be true and then how disappointing  when it isn't?

1963978,4,B0000YTP02,"Trying to please a date, I allowed myself to be dragged to this movie. It turned out to be one of those occasions that you're glad you went along. Since I am estrogen intolerant (chick flicks) and many women are testosterone intolerant (manly flicks), this movie strikes a balance.

It begins with two old men performing acrobatics in a biplane over a Texas twilight sky. But on the horizon is a self-centered and irresponsible mother who drops her son with the two great uncles he's never seen before. The disinterested great uncles agree to take him for the summer. The boy notices a trunk his first night in the house and begins to look at the pictures and past of both of these eccentric men. He is intrigued and discovers more about their past with each event he experiences that summer. The more he learns, the closer he gets to his great uncles, and they with him.

When the mother returns to pick up her son, the climax begins, but that would be telling you the end of the story. I recommend you see it instead.

There is humor and action without violence. Language or skin are not a problem either. This movie is highly recommended for all audiences. It's a keeper.

1963987,4,B0000YTP02,"This movie proves that you can have adventure, action and humor with but a PG rating. There are a few places where the images may be a bit disturbing, such as when Garth McCann (Michael Caine) and Hub McCann (Robert Duvall) shoot at salesmen that have arrived at their front step uninvited. They generally miss; as it turns out they are great shots, even with shotguns. Very young family members may find some of the scenes a bit too violent or threatening; children eight and above should find this movie funny and even touching. Adults especially will like the interplay between veteran actors Caine and Duvall and relative newcomer Haley Joel Osment playing their grand-nephew Walter.

Walter ends up with his eccentric and, as it turns out, wealthy, pair of great-uncles when his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) dumps him. She is supposedly on her way to court reporter school but, as Walter soon discovers, the school is another if his mother's frequent lies.

At first Walter's uncles appear bizarre, and a bit scary. However, as the movie progresses it turns out they just want to be left alone and are more normal than they first appear, though they are definitely eccentric. As an example, their favorite method of fishing involves shotguns.

Walter soon discovers there is much more to his uncles than first appears. Uncle Garth tells Walter their story throughout the first portion of the movie in a series of flashbacks. We discover that Garth and Hub have been in multiple wars, principally in Africa as members of the French Foreign Legion. Or have they? The stories all seem nearly cartoonish and larger-than-life. Given Walter's history with his mother's lies, Walter and we have a hard time believing which of the multiple stories about his uncles is true. Another part of the storyline is the source of his uncle's wealth and where that wealth is kept. All these issues are resolved to the audience's satisfaction by the end of the movie.

At first a viewer might be put off by the nearly fairy tale fashion in which the story is told. Consider that Walter becomes a cartoonist as an adult, and the story is essentially a flashback for Walter. Our memories as children are often biased, with the rough edges smoothed and events that did not fit completely eliminated. Thus some of the scenes of the uncle's adventures are more like a B-movie than modern cinema, but Walter was a boy in 1960s Texas, with memories to match. The images of the movie fit Walter's viewpoint.

The stars of this movie are Caine and Duvall. Osment gets very little chance to do real acting until near the end of the movie. Most of the rest of the movie Osment is in awe of his adventuresome uncles and his acting is kept principally to facial expressions. Caine and Duvall, on the other hand, act as they appear, curmudgeonly and eccentric. Yet, they are honorable and ethical in their own strange way.

I recommend this movie as a family movie. No blood, minimal violence, with few special effects, yet enough humor to keep all but the most jaded movie viewer smiling.",1159056000,,3059,4.7622641509433965

It was a nice night and the movie was great.

1963997,5,B0000YTP02,"There is an art to being both very serious and very funny at the same time.  This film is high art.  The best humor consists of drawing the ordinary out into the ridiculous.  The deepest truths are often best illustrated by the absurd.  One is reminded of the very old Victor Borge playing Happy Birthday to himself in all mock seriousness.

Everything in this film is at least a little bit overdone.  That is part of its genius.  The sword fights are too slashing.  The horse race goes on too long.  The boat in the pond is too large and the pond too small.  The house is too shabby.  Too many people are carrying guns into the cornfield.  Walter's mother is too floozy.  Her new boyfriend is too malicious.  Walter is too serious when he finally confronts her.  He is too demanding when he returns to his uncles afterwards.  It is all wonderfully done.

There are many enigmas here.  For example:  Why were photographs of Hub's lost love, Jasmine, buried in sand in the bottom of an old trunk?  Why did Walter name the sick old lioness after her?  Why did he take her picture with him when his mother took him away?

This is arguably the best piece of comedic work ever done by either Michael Caine or Robert Duvall.  With their obvious synergy why haven't we seen them together for decades already?  And it is wonderful to see Haley Joel Osment growing into a great comedic actor, holding his own against these old lions of film.  But such great work can only be built on a great script.  Did the whole stable of writers for Abbot and Costello come back to pleasure us again?

But with all that, not to forget the delicious collection of 1950s automobiles ramping around in the dust.",1154476800,6,1686,4.4605263157894735
1963998,4,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions is a unique, charming, and mostly wholesome film that the whole family can enjoy.  Not too easy to find a movie like that coming out these days.  The story is about a teenage boy whose irresponsible mother drops him off at two distant uncles' house for a summer.  The boy has never met the two old codgers (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) and they get off on an uneasy footing.  The boy tries to find out about his uncles' mysterious past - are they really criminals sitting on a treasure on their land, as some say?  Or are they adventurers extraordinaire?

The film deals with some tough life issues in a non-syrupy, non-sacchariney way.  And there is a lion, an adorable lion named Jasmine.  Delightful drawings at the end credits by Berkley Breathed, creator of Bloom County, are a treat.",1152835200,6,810,4.654929577464789
1963999,5,B0000YTP02,"This movie is a touching one.

As many people already gave the plot synopsis, I'm not going to repeat the same things over again. This movie is deep. It made me think a lot about my life. And I'm sure it will make YOU think. The movie shows that everyone has his/her secret, like Rovert Duvall's character, he has a past that he doesn't really want to tell anybody, which is the love life of his, and Michael Caine, who is actually a coward whose life has been saved many times by Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment, whose mother constantly uses him to get money.

Another reason why the movie is so touching is because the little things and details in the movie are so realistic, you actually believe that those things can happen in real life, the emotions and expressions the characters have are so real. And you can see the changes in Robert Duvall and Michael Caine's characters, the changes weren't drastic at all, not at all, they were small, gradual changes that happened over a long period of time, that's what makes the movie touching. Because of Haley Joel Osment's character, Duvall and Caine felt love again, they gave their trust to a little kid that they've only lived with for a few months.

The whole movie was fantastic. But I would have to say that one of the best parts of the movie is the ending, when the adult Walter (Haley Joel Osment's character) received the news of his two uncles (Duvall and Caine)'s death, and went to see their plane crash site. Although it's a sad thing that they died, and their deaths is part of the reason why the ending makes you cry, but it's also touching because they died the way they wanted, they died happily and satisfied, you cry but at the same time you smile when you watch the ending.

Good movie, everyone should watch it!",1148601600,8,1787,4.47239263803681
1964000,5,B0000YTP02,"How can you go wrong when you have Robert Duvall and Michael Caine in the same movie?  You could film them washing their cars and shopping for groceries and you'd have an entertaining movie.  When you give them a good script, as you have here, the results are excellent.

Haley Joel Osment proves he can still act as he gets older, and shows that he will have a career that doesn't involve him saying ""I see dead people"" in Scary Movie 17.  He holds his own against two very experienced actors, which is no small feat.

The only thing I didn't care for about this movie was the fact that some brand new characters get introduced toward the end.  When you're racing for the curtain, it's not a good idea to start bringing in new faces.  However, it's a very minor flaw in an otherwise great film.

I wouldn't say this movie is quite as family friendly as some people on here would have us believe, due to some of the events that occur toward the end of the movie that might be very disturbing to younger children.  Having said that, there's really nothing else that would prevent anyone of any age who likes good movies from enjoying this.  Definitely worth a buy.",1145836800,6,1163,4.417840375586854

Excellent acting and an interesting low-key story make this a very enjoyable 110 minutes of entertainment. A story about two old geezers who take in a 14-year- old to their home for a month doesn't sound too exciting but this film will surprise you.

It's tough to find two elder gentlemen as good and appealing as Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, anyway, so you have two winners right there. Add a fine, fine young actor in Haley Joel Osment and now you have three excellent actors who comprise most of the lines of the film.

Unabashedly male, tend to business, like women (and ""...can fall in love with a passion you can't imagine.""), and know right from wrong even if life deals one a bad hand.  This is a movie about compassion, tenderness, courage, and kick-in-the-pants humor.  Granted, there is a bit of excessive stereotyping, but it's within the context that challenges the politically correct roles currently being jammed down the throats of boys in public schools all over the country.  Dare one say it?  The mother in this story is a quintessential loser.  No, she doesn't use drugs or rob banks.  She isn't a victim of males.  She simply lacks the gumption to make something of her life and protect her son from the creeps she hooks up with.

Not to mention the delight of watching Robert Duvall and Michael Caine teach a bunch of teenage toughs about manners.

It's kind of like ""Princess Bride"" - an under-rated 'classic' story that should be part of every rainy-day movie collection.",1138147200,4,583,4.696078431372549
1964010,4,B0000YTP02,"This was the cutest family movie I've seen in a long time.  It was much better than Big Fish, which came highly recommended to me by one of my co-workers. Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment (looking scared to death), and Kyra Sedgwick are all fantastic.  Even Josh Lucas' extended cameo as the adult Walter is a sublime performance.  After watching the deleted and alternate scenes on the flipside of the DVD, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. McCanlies should go back into the editing room and come out with a ""director's cut"" that splices together the alternate endings.  Since this has been out a while, I don't feel bad about giving away spoilers.  The theatrical ending shows adult Walter meeting the Sheik's grandson at the uncles' farm after they die in a freak airplane accident.  The alternate ending shows the funeral and we get to meet Walter's wife and kids;  the funeral is interrupted by an appearance of the sheik himself.  What would've been cool would have been to combine these two endings, Walter gets to give his eloquent eulogy, and then the sheik's grandson arrives in the helicopter and sends the funeral attendees scattering for cover.  I thought it would have been an interesting take for the grandson's son to meet Walter's 2 boys, and the end the movie with them going off to play after the ceremony and sort of wrapping up the storylines.  This would've probably added close to 15 minutes to a 105 minute movie, and family movies tend to run fairly short (I guess the powers that be feel that kids can only pay attention up to 90 minutes or so).  I don't think this would be the case here as the movie draws you into the story so compellingly that you wouldn't know the time had passed. And if you don't warm to this story, I think you better go to the Wizard and ask for a heart.  Docked one star for the alternate ending.",1137801600,2,1869,4.546268656716418

The acting by Haley Joel Osment was nothing short of outstanding, very emotional, beautiful and filled with true love. It is quite beyond me why this actor has not received the praise and accolades of his peers. This boy has performed so well (the sixth sense, AI and Pay it Forward) and others, each one better than the last. Even at the Oscars when the sixth sense won everybody was shocked that Haley did not get his.

For kids, it's safe for them to watch it on their own (although the language may be a bit rough in spots, but Duvall and Caine are playing old Texas boys, so Emily Post is out).  For movie buffs, there's side by side comparison of Script to Screen. For those who want to see what didn't make it to the screen, there's alternate and deleted scenes (including one sight gag involving Walter's imagining breakfast with his two uncles - I'll say no more).

Best of all, director Tim McCanlies audio commentary is insightful and smart. Unlike other DVD audio, where the director and stars end up saying ""That scene was a lot of fun to do"" over and over when they run out of things to say about 30 minutes into the movie, McCanlies's film is such a labor of love that what he says keeps your interest. I don't know if McCanlies will become a millionaire out of this movie, but this film will be seeing a lot of viewing time on TV and DVD long after the summer blockbusters end up in the remainder bin of your local video outlet.",1126915200,12,1374,4.359375

A boy growing up without a father figure, and with a mother who cannot get any traction in life, is delivered to a pair of batchelor uncles to spend the summer.  His assignment is to discover and report where these uncles hide their wealth.  Instead, he discovers the father(s) he never had and the mentors he so desperately needs to grow into manhood.  Without any capitulation to current social trends and fads, and without sappy sentimentality, the meaning and value of family is portrayed, skillfully interwoven with fantastic tales of adventure.

Duvall and Caine play cantankerous old brothers in Texas unwillingly forced to provide a place to stay for a young relative (Osment). They don't know how to treat a kid, and he is initially intimidated by these brusque old men and their habits, such as firing off shotguns at door-to-door salesmen.

Gradually, though, bonds of trust and love are forged, though in true old-school macho style neither brother is willing to verbally acknowledge such.  Through in the boy's clueless mother and her avaricious boyfriend intent on finding and stealing the old men's money and you have a wonderful movie that is suitable for the whole family, despite the PG rating.",1126310400,4,921,4.891025641025641

1964038,5,B0000YTP02,"This movie is very much a 'feel good' movie. However, it is a movie that has a great story line and moving plot.

Duvall and Caine are brothers who own a run down house and barn on several acres of land in Texas. Osment is dumped off at these two men's place by his mother, who quickly informs him that these are his great uncles and they have millions stashed away somewhere on their land. Of course, every living relative attempts to get to their money, and these men want nothing but to be left alone. So Osment's showing up merely alienates him from these men he has never even met nor heard of until he gets left at their place.

Throughout the course of the film, we find out that these two brothers have been accused of being Mafia hit men who stole all that money from Al Capone in the thirties, or that these two men were actually notorious bank robbers who stole all their money and now have it hidden on their place. However, we also find out, after Caine befriends Osment, that these two men were actually action adventurers who went over to Europe just before the first world war and stayed one step ahead of the Germans, until they were shanghaied into the French Foreign legion.

Caine describes to Osment throughout the film all the adventures that he and his brother had in Europe douring the past forty years that they were 'missing.' However, we as the audience do not know the truth about these two men until the very end.

The story of the film is very well developed, it flows well, and in many parts is so funny your gut will hurt from laughing. The DVD box indicates that this film is rated PG for language. However, the language is very mild and my wife and I (since we have nieces and nephews) notices only the words 'Damn' and 'Dammit' on about three or four occasions. Otherwise, the film is very clean.

Caine and Duvall play grumpy old coots who's crazy antics clearly contrast against Osment's innocence.  The love they share between them is heartwarming.

Supposedly the uncles have a lot of money stashed away and so they sit on their Texas farm all day chasing away salesmen.  They tell tall tales about being in the foreign legion in Africa.  The stories are full of romance and adventure but somewhat unbelievable.  But that doesn't matter, because the boy and the uncles are getting to love and respect each other.  Naturally there are conflicts.  And, naturally, everything works out for the best.

This is not my kind of story.  It was too ""feel good"" and sugary.  But the acting was so good and it held my interest and so I do recommend it.  And I think it would be especially appealing for children over the age of 7.",1122163200,,943,4.476470588235294

The hand-drawn road signs bode well, at the movie's beginning.  I remembered a similar sign I first beheld 1976, after an already tricky off-road drive in a remote part of the US; it was badly lettered:

Driver:  If Your THis far, yOUr Too far.

A moment later in the movie, a Texas ""Damn!"" (two full syllables), from Michael Caine no less, adds interest.  Both Caine and Robert Duvall have past experience in two-old-guys movies, which this one partly is, and it's cool.  Enthusiasts of classic US cars may enjoy this movie.  For children it could become a classic, as it's one of those now-rare things, a ""family"" movie with intelligence and bite.  (Such charms can redeem the movie's limitations.)

Especially well drawn, I thought, are the scheming ""relatives,"" complete with eagerly destructive little children.

Not that it is horrible, but it's not good. Three talented actors, including two senior-legends hardly do much acting at all -and their roles requires nothing but one look on their faces, and no emotions are shown at all during one hour and fifty minutes..! It's the strangest movie I've seen so far this year -and I'd recommend you to do something else instead.

The eccentric old uncles Garth and Hub (played by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) are no more pleased about the idea of Walter spending the summer than he is.  They live in a shack and entertain themselves by shooting at traveling salesmen, assembling and flying old biplanes, and other unusual pasttimes.

When Walter sees Hub sleepwalking and reliving sword fights (with a toilet plunger), he asks Garth about it.  The tamer of the two uncles recounts how they had been forced into the French Foreign Legion as young lads and lived a life of wild adventures.  Walter doesn't know whether to believe the stories or not.

Eventually, Walter's mother returns to get him (and hopefully the money) with her no-good, abusive boyfriend.  Walter ends up having to decide with whom he wants to live.

1964071,5,B0000YTP02,"Seldom have I seen a film that so thoroughly delighted all ages and both genders as SECONDHAND LIONS. This film is so entertaining that my daughters both begged me to buy it after having seen it only once... and we've watched it several times with friends who all loved it as much as we do.

Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment give spectacular performances in this extremely heart-felt and hilarious story about how two aging reclusive uncles with a mysterious past care for their nephew one memorable summer. Young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is dropped off at his uncle's sprawling Texan estate one summer day by his flighty, irresponsible mother with instructions to ""find out where they hid the money,"" and practice smiling more. After watching his mother drive off down the dusty road with the dogs barking and chasing along behind, Walter sits down on the big wooden porch with his uncles and discovers they have no telephone... and no TV. ""What do you do for fun?"" Walter asks... and his uncles' answer is both surprising and funny, when a traveling salesman drives up to pitch his wares.

The main mystery in this film is whether the larger-than-life stories that the uncles tell Walt of heroic deeds in exotic lands are really true... or whether they are actually dangerous bank robbers. Walter discovers that sometimes the facts don't matter nearly as much as the qualities described by Duvall's character in a ""long speech I give young men."" It's delightful to watch Walter gain a sense of confidence and trust in the world, as his eccentric uncles do their best to share things they most enjoy with their young nephew.

This film gets its name from a memorable experience when the uncles purchase a lion ""second-hand"" as part of plan to do some big game hunting... and then make the discovery that this used lioness arrives in no shape to provide proper sport. When Walter offers that he can nurse the lioness back to health, he finds more courage and strength than he'd ever had a chance to demonstrate before.

Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment give truly extraordinary performances that will be long remembered in SECONDHAND LIONS. This is a movie that will steal your heart as it refreshes your spirits... and one you'll probably want to buy rather than rent or borrow.

This is a feel good film that excites our imagination and courage rather than panders to sentiment alone.

Yes, it was about a kid, who gets dumped for the summer at the house of two cranky old uncles in hopes of finding their money, but that was basically insignificant because once he does find the money, he's too in love with the men to let anyone, especially his mother and her latest boyfriend, know about it.  The money doesn't play a major role and the lion really doesn't, either.  It is more about a boy growing up and ending up being adopted by his uncles and lessons learned in both directions.

EVERY young man should receive Uncle Hub's ""everything you need to know about being a man"" speech from someone, if they did the world would likely be a much better place to live.

1964101,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions is the kind of movie that will give you the entertainment that you just need to release your tension besides gaining some pretty educational lessons from it. This movie is nice to watch and its story's good enough. It is amazing that this movie is acted by some remarkable actors such as Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and the young Haley Joel Osment.

Duvall and Caine potray as the McCann brothers that dwell in the rural Texas after being dissapear for over 40 years. Their lifestyle are a little strange and they don't wish to be disturbed by anyone. They are said to have endless supply of cash and have a very mysterious history during their young age. Some say they are bank robbers during the 20's and 30's. They might also be just what they said they were about the travelling around the continents(Africa,Shanghai and many more places)and about the lovely Princess Jasmine that Hub(Duvall) met and also the story about the very powerful Sheikh in Africa. Then, Mae(Sedgwick), Walter's(Osment)irresponsible mother left him at his uncles house(McCann brothers)for the summer holidays where Walter just wished not to go.

Walter then learns that his uncles aren't just ordinary people (seeing how they treat those travelling salesman by shooting them away) and he finds out about their background. After he found a picture of a beautiful women in a box, he's more eager to unravel their mysterious history. He keeps on asking his Uncle Garth about them and as day goes on, he managed to know more and more. Finally, he managed to find out everything about his 2 uncles, BUT the thing is, IS IT TRUE like what his Uncle Garth said ?

In the meantime while he discovering their past, he gets some really educational speech from his Uncle Hub. Some really wonderful speech that I like the most are ""A man should believe in what is worth to believe although it might not be true"" and ""Money and power, power and money means nothing to everyone. Only virtues that are important for a man"". This lessons are indeed educational for the young Walter because he has been around his mother's LIES all the time and he doesn't know what to really believe in.

At the end, when Walter's mother comes to bring him home, he tells his mother that he wished to stay with his uncles for a long period of time(at least till after he's through with college). He feels that he could learn much more by staying with his uncles rather than with his mother. The ending is wonderful when the adult Walter receives a call from a syerif telling him that his 2 uncles meet an accident while flying their plane and passed away together in their very old age(over 90 years old).

Walter then gets his uncles' will saying that he gets all their money and then, the Sheikh's grandson came after the news reported about the McCann brothers. The Sheikh's grandson tells Walter that he had heard stories about the great McCann brothers from his grandfather. I feel that this part of the movie is very important to conclude the true background history of the McCann brothers. This part is also important for Walter to know the truth about his uncles that they were really the person they've said they were and not some criminals.

Personally, I prefer this movie very much because everything in this movie is GREAT including the story, ending, soundtracks, the way the actors've brought their character(very appealing) and many more.

Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is dumped for the summer at the farm of his two eccentric and supposedly filthy rich uncles Hob and Garth (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine). Not having a clue how to take care of a young boy, the two uncles procede about their daily routines and allow Walter to tag along. At first shocked by his uncles odd behavior, such as taking pot shots at traveling salesmen and driving money grubbing relatives insane, Walter comes to enjoy his uncles company, especially the stories of their exploits when they were young that Garth tells him. Finding that his uncles have lived lives full of adventure, love and excitement, Walter joins in their rather eccentric ways as he befriends a lion that the uncles have bought and helps them grow a garden of nothing but corn. The movie leaves it open until the very end whether Hob and Garth actually got their wealth from the adventures in Arabia they claim to have had or from bank robberies. That is a conclusion Walter has to come to before it's ever revealed.

A heartwarming movie, Secondhand Lions has a lot of sweetness to be swollowed and might not be for everyone, but is a good movie for family entertainment with some good humor (especially from the over the top stories Garth tells Walter) and should be good for viewers young and old.",1099267200,8,1494,4.65530303030303

1964105,4,B0000YTP02,"A film starring Michael Caine and Robert Duvall should be an assured winner.  Two old coots in some form of retirement in an isolated setting - what better scenario could you seek?  Has it been done before with ""Grumpy Old Men"" or ""The Sunshine Boys""?  Not quite.  For one thing, these two are brothers.  While there is tension, it isn't the dominant theme.  Caine, who  has the incredibly difficult task of becoming a Texican, carries it off admirably.  Duvall, who isn't a Texan either, can convey personalities that overcome narrow origin identities.  Finally, of course, we are left with Osment, who imparts no origins.  In fact, he doesn't seem to have any, nor does he seem very interested in finding any.  He's not even there as a mediator for the two men.  Could this story have been told without him?

The two elderly gentlemen are ensconced in a ramshackle mansion plopped on some location in Texas where there's water.  Fishing with shotguns and making bizarre purchases with an undisclosed source of income, their settled life is rudely interrupted by Walter [Osment] being dumped on their verandah.  The castaway child theme is pretty shopworn, and Osment struggles valiantly to shed the bonds of clich.  In their portrayals, the two great-uncles offer all possible support for this effort - with Duvall providing a sense of mystique and Caine giving a sort of detached caring function.  Caine is given the task of relating the pair's romantic history to Walter's rapt attention.  It's not Cinderella in reversed gender, yet the pair seem only mildly interested in raising Walter.  The inevitable ""running away"" scene sets this aspect firmly.

As the story unfolds, Walter provides a focus for the grand-uncles.  They don't ""raise"" him, of course.  He's pretty much too old for that already.  But he becomes increasingly aware that these two aren't simply a brace of bizarre old coots.  His respect for them grows as they demonstrate their respective strengths.  Little is demanded of Walter by the brothers, but he merges into their live with increasing readiness.  This progress is attended by some wonderfully hilarious scenes.  McCanlies' imaging talents come to the fore in his use of a pack of dogs of indeterminate breeds.  They are attentive to all events, and one senses they are a set of canine ""Walters"" who clearly entered the homestead seeking refuge and elected for permanence.  But the lion . . . ?

Although this trio all struggle to overcome a tired plot - even the novel ending doesn't redeem it - the effort is misguided.  Someone should have contracted to bring these three together, then write an appropriate story for their skills.  Instead, they were given the wrong writer in the wrong context doing the wrong job.  Whoever initiated the ""writer-director"" duality should be sizzling in the furthest reaches of Sheol.  The two job descriptions simply cannot be properly merged.  This is a film by a Texican, of Texicans and for Texicans.  McCanLies' commentary, riddled with ""ums"", ""unhhs"" and ""ers"" should have been replaced by commentary by the working trio.  It's worth a single viewing - just to see Caine and Duvall working together.  Now that they've worked together once, perhaps somebody can do the job properly next time.

1964109,5,B0000YTP02,"When I saw this movie in the theater last year, people clapped at the end. I walked into this movie with no expectations; I just wanted to see it because I think Haley Joel Osment is a great actor.

The movie is set during the 1950s in Texas. A young boy lives with his Great Uncles during the summer and he learns about their life and adventures.  The movie has a nice and simple story and teaches great lessons.

Even though most people won't admit it because it might seem ""uncool"", people like movies like this because they give them hope.  If you want a great movie you can see with your whole family, this is perfect. If you want a movie with violence, profanity, or sex scenes; you probably want to skip this one.",1095984000,5,720,4.311111111111111

I highly recommend renting this or borrowing it, but unless it's really super-cheap or you have a family who visits a lot and likes family movies (like with little kids or something), you probably don't want to buy it.",1095552000,,356,4.430769230769231

It is good, 'ol fashioned movie making based on the cornerstones of excellent writing, acting, directing, and camera work. All the family will enjoy the story, albeit on different levels. It instantly became a favorite of ours so we bought the DVD, which we rarely do. Don't forget to look for the Easter Eggs if you buy it.",1094947200,,450,4.567901234567901
1964122,4,B0000YTP02,"This was a feel-good story lite on sap.  I hadn't wanted to see the movie because of the trailer.  After I watched it, however, I realized what an injustice the preview had done to the movie itself.

I loved the country setting and cinematography as well as the fact that most of the story unfolds in the 50s (maybe 60s?). Well-known stars and good acting help make this touching story a screen hit.

Without giving away vital details, a couple of old rogue-ish great uncles wind up caring for their great nephew that they've only recently come to know.  Not only are the men bachelors, they're mildly grumpy, and stuck in their ways.  Needless to say, taking care of a young boy isn't in their repetoire of experience or necessarily something they have much interest in doing.  Recounting their past grand adventures keeps the boy entertained and intrigued.  Listening to these stories, which are portrayed retrospectively throughout the movie, draws him closer to his uncles and they form a remarkable bond.  I found myself chuckling many times throughout the movie because of some of the uncles' antics.  Likewise, I felt heavy-hearted in some scenes because of the emotional burden the boy has to carry.

The movie won't appeal to everyone (my husband fell asleep while watching it), but I still highly recommend it.  Why four stars and not five?  This wouldn't make my top 10 list.  However, good story, good acting, well-directed and produced, a bit of humor, a bit of sadness, a happy ending...what's not to love?  Oh yeah, the trailer!",1094860800,3,1543,4.83587786259542

The story brings back the literary concept of a frame story, or a story within a story.  We're never sure whether the story Garth tells is true until the end, but I'm not going to spoil it.

The acting is excellent, but with leads like this, could it really go wrong?  Duvall and Caine are the ultimate crochety old uncles, while Osmet's character does grow over the course of the film.  He learns more about life over the course of the summer, it seems, than in the previous years of his life.

So if you're looking for a good movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, definitely check this one out!",1091836800,5,756,4.28169014084507
1964125,5,B0000YTP02,"Inspiring and absolutely delightful. Other reviews will lay out the story for you, but for me, this has become my second favorite movie (behind Ben Hur). Its appeal lies in the subtle character development where the old guys don't recognize their value to Walter. Nor do they recognize what Walter means to them. The story hits rock bottom the night Walter has decided to head for Montana. Michael Caine lays out one of the most effective leadership tools known to man: When someone has drawn a line in the sand (Walter's decision to leave) offer him a purpose that gives him an honorable way out (Walter's effect on relatives). Walter's character develops throughout the movie, until at the very end, he makes a life changing decision and realizes that, for his own good, he must give up a dream he had cherished all his life. And, towards the end, when he finally lays it on the line to Duvall and Caine... and Duvall and Caine stand there and take it, well, you know that Walter has earned their respect. 'What do you want us to die of... old age?' 'Yes... yes I do!' It shows us all quite a bit about growing up and growing old. I hope you enjoy it! :)",1090800000,4,1156,4.4575471698113205

1964127,4,B0000YTP02,"This movie proves that you can have adventure, action and humor with but a PG rating. There are a few places where the images may be a bit disturbing, such as when Garth McCann (Michael Caine) and Hub McCann (Robert Duvall) shoot at salesmen who have arrived at their front step uninvited. They generally miss; as it turns out they are great shots, even with shotguns. Very young family members may find some of the scenes a bit too violent or threatening; children eight and above should find this movie funny and even touching. Adults especially will like the interplay between veteran actors Caine and Duvall and relative newcomer Haley Joel Osment playing their grand-nephew Walter.

  Walter ends up with his eccentric and, as it turns out, wealthy, pair of great-uncles when his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) dumps him. She is supposedly on her way to court reporter school but, as Walter soon discovers, the school is but another if his mother's frequent lies.

  At first Walter's uncles appear bizarre, and a bit scary. However, as the movie progresses it turns out they just want to be left alone and are more normal than they first appear, though they are definitely eccentric. As an example, their favorite method of fishing involves shotguns.

  Walter soon discovers there is much more to his uncles than first appears. Uncle Garth tells Walter their story throughout the first portion of the movie in a series of flashbacks. We discover that Garth and Hub have been in multiple wars, principally in Africa as members of the French Foreign Legion. Or have they? The stories all seem nearly cartoonish and larger-than-life. Given Walter's history with his mother's lies, Walter and we have a hard time believing which of the multiple stories about his uncles is true. Another part of the storyline is the source of his uncle's wealth, and where that wealth is kept. All these issues are resolved to the audience's satisfaction by the end of the movie.

  At first a viewer might be put off by the nearly fairy tale fashion in which the story is told. Consider that Walter becomes a cartoonist as an adult, and the story is essentially a flashback for Walter. Our memories as children are often biased, with the rough edges smoothed and events that did not fit completely eliminated. Thus some of the scenes of the uncle's adventures are more like a B-movie than modern cinema, but Walter was a boy in 1960s Texas, with memories to match. The images of the movie fit Walter's viewpoint.

  The stars of this movie are Caine and Duvall. Osment gets very little chance to do real acting until near the end of the movie. Most of the rest of the movie Osment is in awe of his adventuresome uncles, and his acting is kept principally to facial expressions. Caine and Duvall, on the other hand, act as they appear, curmudgeonly and eccentric. Yet, they are honorable and ethical in their own strange way.

  I recommend this movie as a family movie. No blood, minimal violence, with few special effects, yet enough humor to keep all but the most jaded movie viewer smiling.",1090454400,,3076,4.760828625235405
1964128,5,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions"" was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It ranks, in my opinion, up there with ""Forrest Gump"" which is my all time favorite. The cinematography was awesome, especially the part where Jasmine, the lion, attacked the buzzard who was beating up Haley Joel Osment's character. This child knows how to act and, if you'll notice, he was little Forrest in ""Forrest Gump."" So a big thumb's up for this young man who makes me laugh and cry in every movie I've ever seen him in.

 Michael Caine and Robert Duvall have always been two of my favorite actors. The stories Caine told about the heroic Duvall character seemed so far-fetched, but wound up being true as gold at the end of the picture when the sheik's grandson lands on the farm property in his helicopter.

 It is true what they say about buzzards flocking to the kill. Relatives knew these two old uncles had a lot of money, so they hovered around them like eagles after their prey. I'm so grateful I had a wonderful mom and dad, because Osment's mom was one I would never have wanted. I'm glad he decided to stay with his uncles and because of his love for the two old coots, he was left everything when they were both killed at the ripe old age of 90+.

 This is a movie I plan to buy, both in VHS and widescreen DVD, because I plan to watch it over and over again until I can say the dialogue by heart.",1090454400,,1379,4.305019305019305
1964129,4,B0000YTP02,"It was sad for me to see adults pushing their kids in the long-winded queues for Spiderman2 and Pokemon at the local theatre, while this touching entertainer was tossed aside (relatively) to the sidelines.
There is no doubt that Secondhand Lions is a semi-manipulative film, it has its fair share of smarmy feel-good contrivances that betray its zeal to tug at our heart strings. But the quirky mirth of all its characters, the idiosynchratic plotline, and a healthy dose of moving, meaningful moments makes this a very wholesome experience.
Duvall and Caine, as two reclusive millionaire uncles drunk on guns and eccentricity, pitch in very well. Caine warms up to his part in the film first, but the screen is really owned by a very fit Duvall, who soon becomes the pivotal character in the film as the uncle that the kid (Hailey Osment) turns to for advice. Osment does remarkably well to hold his own against these two big tykes. A barnful of cute animals and a truckful of drooling relatives round up the doozy cast.
Some fantastic (literally) flashbacks form an interesting trope for the movie's core message: that in our lives having conviction in things we may doubt to be untrue is ultimately a critical virtue. This leads to a somewhat corny twist at the end but it's an interesting one to make the point. There's plenty of action and some amusing gags that even evoked loud guffaws in the theatre.
All in all, whether you have kids or not, but especially if you do, this deserves a recommendation of the highest order.",1090022400,10,1529,4.7518796992481205

Make no mistake, folks, this is the real thing: a truly mesmerizing family film that is able to be humorous, scary, thrilling and inspiring - frequently all at the same time.  How many years has it been since three generations of your family were able to repeatedly laugh and cheer loudly for a film?  This is in the rare class of films that will go on and on, like Wizard of Oz, Shane, Dragonslayer, High Noon, Miracle on 34th Street,  and a very few others, except that it is better than several of them.  It is a film for all time and all ages.  It is definitely not just a ""kid's picture"". Perhaps I am partial to ""modern legends.""  I think we all are.",1089590400,10,860,4.271604938271605
1964141,5,B0000YTP02,"You look  at a film  in many ways.  For one thing this is the first non animated  family film I'd actually feel safe showing to small children in a long time.  (by the by there are quite a few animated ""family"" films such as Atlantis I woul;d not let a kid see, too violent)  Secondhand lions has a little violence, some deceit and  strange humor.  Good humor safe and funny instead of crude  body humor.
  The  romance adventure part of the story echoes out of something like  arabian nights.  so outragous that you wonder if its them pulling his leg or  truth being stranger than fiction.
  A story line that whiler a little corny  is funny and sweet.  I think Walter teaches those 2 old guys to really love again.  A very unexpected hero  against the bad guy and a running gag or two that run just long enough to be funny without getting worn out and stupid.
  Along with a few really good lines and qoutes a mystery that makes you wanna really pay attention and a suprise ending this is one of the best movies  I'd seen in a while and definatly the best movie I saw in the theater last summer.

1964142,4,B0000YTP02,"Strangel titled film ""Secondhand Lions"" refer to the two veterans Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, who play the grumpy old uncles to the 14-year-old boy Haley Joel Osment.  Though the film is sugary at times, wearing its heart on the sleeve, the two leading actors are so good and wonderful that sooner or later you stop thinking about any bad things about it.  And the animals (including a lion) are also fun to see.
The two elderly brothers Hub and Garth are living in an old house, in the middle of nowhere, with four dogs and a pig.  They are said to have lots of money, and some of the relatives and the salesmen too rather insistently try to be nice to them.  Their usual method of turning their kind offer is sarcasm or shotguns.
To them, comes Mae (Kyra Sedgwick, most underrated and ill-used) and her son Walter (Osment).  Mae drops him at the door of their house, saying some transparent lies about her new career.  Walter, now alone, has nowhere to go but these grim old guys, who, however, later turn out not so unfriendly to him.  And there seems to have been a romance in their past, concerning the adventure and a girl named Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugier).
To say ""Secondhand Lions"" is full of corny moments is pointless; it is about the life taken as such, full of absurd and ridiculous things, but still worth to experience, and the two veteran actors are to teach the young a few thing about life through these absurd and ridiculous events the film shows us.
See, for example, the ""fight"" scenes between Robert Duvall's Hub and four young men wielding switch-blades.  If I write the result of the brawl (which I won't), you will not  believe it, no more than the Southern accent of Sir Micheal Caine.  But that happens, and to those who are ready to accept these tales as they are, that becomes true, and gives hilarious time.
My complaint is different -- it's about Osment.  Though born in 1988, he is too old (or mature) to play Walter, who could listen to these men's tales among the sheiks and camels.  And the ending (which is re-written) is unnecessarily long, explaining what the film should not explain.  But anyway, that's my complaint, and you may feel otherwise.
Hokum, sure, but ""Secondhand Lions"" is the kind of a film we always need; need, I mean, to feel good, to watch with family, and most of all to know that we like these sweet tales and extraordinary characters we could see only in film.",1089417600,2,2424,4.557603686635945

I'm not much of a critic of the technical aspects of DVDs, as many other reviewers are.  I am far more interested in the story and the entertainment value of the film.  This is a superb story about a couple of aged iconoclasts, brothers Garth and Hub (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) and their grand nephew, Walter (Haley Joel Osment), whose mother Mae (Kyra Sedgewick), a self-centered, shallow woman who is more interested in money and her boyfriends than her son, dumps Walter on the uncles supposedly while she attends a school in Texas, but who is really in Las Vegas getting a new boyfriend who, in turn, is interested mainly in the cache of money the uncles have stashed.

This is a great story, involving the uncles homebuilt airplane, their history of travels with the Foreign Legion, First World War adventures, Africa, and a supposed background as bank robbers.

The wonderful actors, Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, share the same screen, an event in itself worth watching if nothing else, but for added measure the wonderful presence of Haley Joel Osment, who plays his part flawlessly, as well as the zoo of animal actors involved in the story, make for an extraordinary production.  If you like it as much as I did, it will be a box-office winner.  Particularly amusing was the sales resistance technique of Caine and Duvall.  It will be imitated, I hope, by all viewers with 12 gauge shotguns.  Hillarious!

1964145,5,B0000YTP02,"My mother sent me this movie with two pieces of advice - watch it with your boys, and look at Michael Caine.  I heeded both and was rewarded.  Michael Caine looked amazingly like my own grandfather who was born and raised in Paris, TX, and the messages in the movie are indispensable to any parent wanting to raise his or her kids right.  Besides, the showcase of late 50s/early 60s automobiles and radio clips was fun to see and hear.  Where else are you going to find cars like these outside of a junkyard?  There's a lot to learn here - importance of role models in life, importance of family over money, value of just being/felt needed.  The two uncles Garth and Hub McCann had seemingly resigned themselves to a pastoral life of faded past glory,  punctuated by obnoxious salesmen and godawful, venal relatives lingering around in hopes of being included in a will.  Along comes young Walter, dropped off by his desperate and flighty mother.  Things start rocky for the three of them but the uncles discover having Walter around got rid of the pesky relatives, got them to enjoy some of that stashed-away money, and the three of them genuinely began to grow on each other.  The barbecue joint scene is priceless - Hub's short discourse on the roots of juvenile delinquency was outstanding.  And woven through the show via Garth's story-telling is the history of uncles' life as young men out to see the world, getting shanghaied into the French Foreign Legion and finally making their fortune through devious but clever means.  Hub died inside after his princess bride died in childbirth, and it took Walter's plea of desperation to make him realize that despite his bitterness and sense of loss he still had something to live for.  Walter did what none of his relatives did - treated his uncles like human beings worthy of respect.  He sincerely loved them and it paid off in the end when his uncles finally died of an old age much more satisfying owing to Walter's presence in their lives.  True, there was some staging and inaccuracies like, how did the uncles' plane crash into the barn and leave no gaping holes or debris strewn about?  The scene would lead you to believe the plane was pushed tail-first through the barn wall to the outside.  Also, if Walter was 13-14 yrs old at a period pegged roughly at 1960, he should have been pushing 40 when his uncles died; yet, he appeared as a young cartoonist of 25-30.  Technicalities, who cares, right?  I enjoyed the Texas countryside scenes; credits say it was filmed near Austin but it looks a lot like northeast of Dallas where many of my maternal relations still live.  Garth's recounting of their youth in North Africa had a heavy touch of swashbuckling adventure more than likely embellished, but even this had a point.  Stories from your elders may very well sound like tall tales but that shouldn't take away from the truth of their accomplishments.  In conclusion - watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.  There's a pleasant lack of Hollywood-style T&A, shock value, doomsday grimness and young-punk pretentiousness.  True, there was a lion in the movie, but I'm thinking the title may refer to the uncles' images of themselves in their old age.",1088467200,4,3222,4.732974910394265

This movie was better than 'OK' (three stars), so I give it four - but then it lumps itself in with other films I've given four stars, and this one wasn't quite as good (i.e., He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not).  So, I'd say three and half stars, which rounds up to four in this case.  Why?  Well, the ending was a little sappy.  I guess it was intending to show that the stories were valid, but it seemed a little forced.  Also, Osment has officially entered the awkward stage - get ready for lots of squeaky exclamations!

1964171,1,B0000YTP02,"I bought this movie because the trailer looked good, and the stars are well-known.
Unfortunately, Haley Joel Osment's acting was a disappointment.  I thought his acting in ""Artificial Intelligence"" was good, but the now older Haley is no longer ""cute"", plus his adolescence voice was cracking up several times in this show.  His baby-ish face with a teenage body just looked some how strange.  His expressions just seem over-exaggerated at several times in the movie.
Michael Caine and Robert Duvall acted well in this show, despite of Haley's performance.  I can almost see Robert Duvall making a greater than usual effort to make up for the lack of storyline and poor dialogue script.
What else is wrong in this movie? It looks like a fairy tale where a boy gets to grow up with 2 heroic uncles, who happens to be extremely rich.  And a very strange way of being rich too.  One moment they were shooting at every salemen who approaches them, and the next monment, at Haley's prompting, they were splurging money on all kinds of ""toys"".  One of the toys is a female lion, which just didn't make sense -- the lion was dysfunctional (too old to be aggressive or ferocious), but yet took an instant liking to Haley.  Huh?  Do lions do that? Also, the historical background of Robert Duvall's love with the princess and the war were just not captivating.

1964173,4,B0000YTP02,"Sometimes you have to give a film credit just for trying.  ""Secondhand Lions"" comes across as a tad mushy, always searching for a tear-jerking moment, but it never goes over the edge.  Haley Joel Osmont plays a pre-teen dumped by his flighty Mother at the Texan ranch of her two eccentric uncles (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall).  Caine and Duvall excel in humorous odd behavior and compliment each other's characters (Caine is the sensitive one and Duvall is the macho brother).  Haley Joel Osment overacts a bit as the nave castaway, but his heart is intact.  Besides hunting fish with shotguns, violently chasing away traveling salesmen and buying an old lion just to shoot it when it arrives, the two uncles start to grow fond of their `nephew'.  What follows is a summer of tall tales, oddball relatives, a gang of teenage bullies and a large cache of money that is rumored to exist on the property.  The stories Caine tells Osment about their past are lively, humorous and vividly reproduced in scenes edited throughout the film.  It seems the two brothers were shanghaied to Morocco during World War II.  The biggest secret regards the cache of money that all the greedy relatives want to get their hands on.
The direction and sound is superb and the acting is believable if you can get past Caine's inability to sound like a Texan.  Director Tim McCanlies directorial debut keeps the story going and the end result is a nice surprise.  It seems life can be fair after all.  This makes for a good family film, especially for younger boys, but it's nice to have a movie that exudes a wholesome atmosphere akin to a Mark Twain story.  It may be another `coming of age' story, but the cast and director make sure you are never bored.
Lots of extras are here, including the Director's commentary (there's some interested anecdotes), an `On The Set' mini-documentary and another documentary on actor Haley Joel Osment, which is fairly amazing considering his age.",1085443200,,1966,4.781065088757397

1964176,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions, Not a Second Rate Movie
Secondhand Lions takes the form of a flashback within a flashback movie.  It is told from the point a young boy named Walter played by Haley Joel Osment.  The movie starts in the 1990's with the death of Walters's two uncles.  This is the lead-in to a flashback of Walters's life with his uncles, Hub (Robert Duval) and Garth (Michael Caine), set in the 1950's.  Walters mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgewick), is takes Walter to see his two great uncles to stay for the summer.  Walter's abandonment by Mae is the normal state of affairs.  The difference this time is that Mae has an ulterior motive for leaving Walter with two estranged great uncles, as they are said to be unbelievably wealthy.  The two uncles are initially unhappy at the thought of having Walter to stay; however, they do warm to him once they discover how much his presence annoys their gold digging vulture-like relations, who are just praying the two old war horses will drop dead.  Walter soon finds out that there is more to these cantankerous old men than is at first apparent. when Walter discovers uncle Hub sleep walking and fighting.  This starts uncle Garth telling of the story of uncle Hub and the princess Jasmine. We then see Hub and Garth as young men, seeking adventure in Europe and beyond.  This starts a wondrous tale consisting of an evil sheik, assassins, and an incredible treasure; all interspersed with swashbuckling action. Walter is eventually accepted into the family and there are a number of amusing and heart warming incidents with shotguns, chewing tobacco, and a lion.
Secondhand Lions is a marvelous tale full of fun and capers that could be appreciated by all ages.  The relationship between the two uncles, as well as, the one cultivated between them and Walter were particularly enjoyable. The uncles had a balance to their personalities with one a little blundering while the other was akin to a warrior from a legend.  What resulted was a well rounded harmony where each made up for the others deficits.  Their relationship with Walter grew until they became more like father figures to him, treating him like an equal in their relationship because they were unaware of how to treat a child.  This is evident in the way Walter is included in all the uncles' activities, no matter how inappropriate for a child, from gardening to chewing tobacco to bar fights.
Another part that I particularly enjoyed was when the uncles purchased a used lion from a circus it's relationship with Walter.  It was very much like the relationship with his uncles, beginning with fear and growing into a mutual love for one another.  The lion served as a metaphor for the uncles; it was old and worn-out but still having a strong spirit, just like the two uncles. The lion was also similar to the uncles in that it was no longer of much use to anybody except for a boy who needed something or someone to love.  The uncles did not want to die of old age but to go out with their boots on, much like the lion did.
Further amusement was produced by the uncles antagonizing the gold-digging relatives and their bratty kids, who would not abandon their hope of getting their hands on the uncles' money.  One scene in particular stands out when the relatives are all sitting on a hot porch with nothing to drink, watching while the uncles ask Walter if he is enjoying his root beer.
This story transitioned effortlessly from present day to the 1950's to the 1910's and back again.  The viewer is led from era to era by the tales of the uncles exploits through their lives.  Walter initiates the flashes between the eras with questions about their lives.  I would watch this movie again for a number of reasons, most specifically the interaction between the characters particularly Hub for his general bad temper and aggression that he uses to cover his fear of becoming ineffective.  This is portrayed well by the scene where Hub thrashes the gang of delinquent youths in a bar fight. He then takes them home to give them dinner and his famous ""what a boy needs to know about being a man"" speech.
Although this move was more like a movie of the 60's, with clean-cut fun, it was well directed and moved at a pleasant pace.  I would be more than happy to recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good adventure story with strong actors.",1084147200,9,4362,4.66579634464752
1964177,5,B0000YTP02,"Oh, wow!!! This was a fantastic movie and definitely a good one to own AND give as gifts.  The DVD has lots of features including an alternate ending longer than the one that was actually used.  I am still not sure which ending I liked best.
This is TRULY a family movie that the whole family will just adore.  Walter (Haley Osment) has one of those moms who looks pretty but is about as substantial as a fistful of sand.  Under the pretense that she is going to a court reporting school and can't take care of Walter, she drops him off with his eccentric, reclusive and rich uncles Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall). Everyone knows that the two old coots have tons of money but no one agrees on how they got it. Though most think that they robbed banks in their youth, Garth spins a beautiful tale to Walter of how they were abducted into the French Foreign Legion and stayed on in Morocco to fight wars and win their fortune.  They spend their time target practicing on traveling salesmen until Walter convinces them to start spending some of their money.  From vegetable gardens to second hand lions, they have a whale of a summer getting to know each other.  Walter is smitten with his uncles and they with him. When Walter's mother returns, he will be forced to choose whether to believe the fanciful stories of his uncles that are so inextricably tied up with who they are and their relationship to each other or to believe the more realistic sounding stories of the envious relations with disastrous results.
Don't miss the alternate/deleted scenes either.  There were a lot of side stories or running jokes that had been intended and then were mostly cut out.  For instance, substianting evidence that the two had actually been bank robbers deepens Walter's dilemma in who to believe but that was for some reason cut out. There is virtually a whole other movie in the deleted and alternate scenes. This is a great, great movie that should take its place beside films like Old Yeller and Wizard of Oz on the shelf of American Family Classics.",1083628800,8,2061,4.594005449591281

1964190,5,B0000YTP02,"It's hard not to like a film that is so wonderfully cast, and one that manipulates to all the right points.  Robert Duvall and Michael Caine shine in the way they underplay their roles of the eccentric, yet wise, great uncles to Haley Joel Osment's Walter.  Osment, a perpetual child at heart, once again demonstrates the talent he was given, and doesn't play on his ""cuteness,"" but acts the role as he should.  There are some wonderfully funny and touchingly poignant moments in the film.  The stories told by Caine about his brother's swashbuckling days is all Indiana Jones and one wonders if they are true?  Or are these affable old gentlemen truly bank robbers?  If you watch the deleted scenes, you can see where the evidence is strong that they did rob banks.  Director Mccaslin obviously wanted us to believe what might not be true, in expiating these scenes from the final cut.  At any rate, what matters is the affection that develops between Osment and the cantankerous men.  Josh Lucas as the grown up Walt gives a beautiful eulogy in one of the deleted scenes; the over the top ending in this version is pretty hard to swallow; the ending in the final cut is more convincing.
Overall, though, this is a pleasant change of pace from all the CGI, foul language and violence out there today.  This is a movie the whole family can sit down and enjoy.

1964191,4,B0000YTP02,"Like many other reviewers I did not have high hopes for this film, other than the actors involved. But, Secondhand Lions is a very entertaining family movie. Both Michael Caine and Robert Duval are great playing Walter's crazy relatives who in reality teach this abandoned young man a lot about life.
I particularly liked this movie for two reasons. First - it is very entertaining. The movie does a solid job of balancing the humor with the more serious parts. On the serious side the brothers played by Caine and Duval do a tremendous job of teaching the young man about being a man, despite their reservations about helping out. As far as humor goes, I was laughing out loud during multiple scenes. You are sure to enjoy the ""shotgun fishing"", highly effective ways of dealing with a salesman (which also involves shotguns), and high adventure stories from the French Foreign Legion, just to name a few.
The second reason I like this movie involves the main theme of the plot. Basically, it is about two ""misfits"" teaching a young boy about becoming a man. Given the lack of male role models in today's society, it is encouraging to see someone tackling this subject in a family movie. It does so without all the killing, loud music, or cussing that you find in way too many modern films.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining tale about a young man finding his way in the world.",1082937600,2,1412,4.652

Whine number one:  What happened to the pig?  Did they eat it?  If so, they should have made it more clear.

Whine number two:  The comic strip credits at the end, by the inimitable Berke Breathed (creator of Bloom County and Opus), while great, came way out of left field.  The theme should have been woven into the movie a little better.

Whine number three:  ...oops.  Guess there isn't one.",1082851200,2,587,4.373831775700935
1964193,4,B0000YTP02,"Little Walter (Osment) lives with his irresponsible mother (Sedgwick) who decides, one summer, to leave him with his two eccentric uncles. He is very introverted and his uncles seem to have no patience for other people, including their own family. This makes for an awkward union, with the easily scared kid not knowing how to behave or what to expect from his two seemingly out-of-it relatives.
Secondhand lions is a heart warming film from beginning to end. Even if it gets a little corny in some moments, to see how the two old men open up to this kid who comes out of the shell in front of their eyes is truly beautiful.
However, this film is not only a coming of age story. To keep the story going without dragging its feet in sugary moments between the characters, we are shown the story of how the uncles lived their younger years and how they supposedly amased a fortune. These are very tall tales - the Foreign Legion, world wars, sheiks, damsels in distress, bank robberies and a whole lot more. Are these tales true? Did the uncles really do all this or is it just their imagination? Does it matter if it's true when you really believe in something?
The film is also full of funny moments, coming mostly from the habits of the two old men and from the kid's reactions to them and to their eccentric lifestyle.
Having said all that, the thing that takes this movie to the next level is the performances given by the three leads. Oscar winners Robert Duvall and Michael Caine play the uncles to Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment's Walter, and none of them miss a beat throughout the whole film. Duvall is excellent as the tough as nails, not-to-be-messed-with uncle Hub, just as Caine does a fantastic job with the warmer uncle Garth. But I feal that the movie belongs mostly to Osment, who again proofs he's the best child actor to come around in a while. Now in his teenage years, he has made a successful transition to more adult characters (even if 'more adult' means having 15 years!).
All in all, a great movie.",1082419200,3,2024,4.532786885245901
1964194,4,B0000YTP02,"I have to admit, this movie was not on my A-list.  Although Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are two of my favorite actors, family movies, well, are usually cheaply made and second rate.  But this time my wife rented the movie and when she brought Secondhand Lions home, I concealed my sigh and watched it any way.  I am sure glad she rented it- it is a great family movie.
This is good family entertainment.  The story keeps one guessing until the end, are these two eccentric uncles just crazy, or did they live exciting lives as younger men?  There is a lesson for us here. In a youth oriented culture, we tend to be very dismissive of old people.  We see them as past their prime whose day is over and who have little to contribute except to leave us a bunch of money. This movie was a reminder that old people were once young; they were driven by the same passions we are, they had the adventures that may even surpasses our mundane existence.
So gather the kids around the tube and slip Secondhand Lions into your DVD player.  It will be an evening well spent. They are not too many movies that appeal to a multigenerational audience that we can watch together without embarrassment.",1082419200,2,1188,4.447004608294931

Maybe it reminds me of the virtues all boys aspire to when they are young, and the real life synergies it has. Whatever the case, everyone can relate to this movie and root for the idealistic life that life seems to never deliver. Its a good movie for a family and even a sci-fi, techie buff like me.

Rarely does our nineteen year old son watch television with us. For some reason he decided to that night.
WOW! The three of us were laughing too hard to fully appreciate every funny scene and had to play back constantly. In one particular gem of a moment Robert Duvall is harrassed by a foursome of juvenile delinquents at a restaurant. And so he calmly sets out to help these young men understand what true manhood entails. We played that scene four times in a row just to get all the laughs!
The flashbacks of these two elderly brothers' lives is rigged for maximum hokem which adds to the charm and the earnest interest of their distantly related nephew dumped in their care sets the stage for a wonderful coming of age story.
Every single character reaches the high notes. When it threatens to teeter into treacle, just the right line brings it on home.

Osment is definitely at a transitional stage, and in a couple of places in this film his acting seemed forced, but being that the film is a coming of age movie, it didn't hurt that much.  As to whether this is the kind of movie to own, it's hard to give it a real strong ""yes you'll want to see it over and over"" type of recommendation but seeing as it's hard to get a movie to entertain such a wide age range it's probably a keeper.",1080518400,2,695,4.133333333333334

 This movie is about Walter, (Haley Joel Osment) going to live with his two great-uncles for the summer, because his mom is a careless rolling stone looking out for herself. She lies to Walter, and the damage is easily seen in Osment's character. He is somewhat downtrodden, but his sense of curiosity and ability to have fun never dwindles. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play his eccentric, misunderstood, and single uncles. They are pure magic on the screen and give you what you paid for and more. This movie also tells of the uncles' adventures, numerous and splendid, in Northern Africa.

1964225,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions was a pleasing watch for me. Aside from the fact that it had two of our greatest actors, Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, it was simply a well done movie all the way around.
The story of two old bachelors ending up taking care of a teenaged boy dumped on them by his gold-digging mother could have gone a number of different directions, from comic to tragic. This film had a good balance of both, and the whole range in between.
As a male growing up in this culture, I can identify with the lack of ritual, leadership, or healthy male bonding. Tribal cultures had a structure and process for a person's development through the stages of life, and it tended to be relevant to one's actual life. We are in a culture with no respect for Nature, other people, or ourselves, and our souls cry out for such things.
Many people may find it campy or corny or whatever, but the underlying theme in this movie is that boys need to have some sort of initiation into manhood by a man (or better yet, men) with knowledge and experience of life and death. This film makes a good stab at showing how that can happen in little ways when individual men stand up and make a difference in a boy's life. It also shows how men whose prime is past are still important and vital to society. All the battles worth winning are not just in wars. Some of the most important are right there on your own doorstep.
I was really looking forward to seeing this as I was intrigued by the possibilities of Duvall and Caine on screen together. I was not disappointed. (Have those two ever done anything bad? If so, I haven't seen it.)

It sounds like bad news but before we can find out we have dissolved into the past where Walter is now a 12-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is being dumped by his flighty mother (Kyra Sedgwick) on two uncles he never knew he had.
They are actually his great-uncles, Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall), and while his mother insists that he has to do this because she is going off to court reporting school she keeps talking about the fact that these two old guys have got a lot of money buried someplace on the farm and either he can find out where it is or become so beloved by them that they will remember him in their will.  There is another set of relatives who come for the weekend in their Sunday go to meeting clothes and they are not happy to see any competition.  As for Garth and Hub, they like to sit on the front porch and shoot their shotguns at the salesman that come along and there are a lot of those, because it seems everybody knows that the two old coots have a lot of money and their own theory about how they got their hands on it in the first place.
There are no surprises here in that we know the young boy and the two old men are going to change each other.  When one salesman actually has the nerve to come back and face those shotguns a second time it is Walter who suggests maybe they should find out what the guy is selling.  That marks the beginning of a lot of changes as Garth and Hub start to buy a lot of things from seeds (mostly corn apparently) to a giraffe and, as the title indicates, a used lion.  Actually a used lioness, who becomes the pet that Walter never had (""Secondhand Giraffe"" does not have the same sense of flair apparently).
Most of the best parts of this film have Garth and Hub engaging in their eccentricities.  They like to use their shotguns to fish and when a bunch of young hotheads try to pick a fight Hub at least is more than willing to show them the error of their ways (he also gives them another chance after showing them the correct way to use a knife).  For his part Garth spends time now and then telling Walter the story behind Hub's habit of sleepwalking in the middle of the night.  The story has to do with the young Garth (Kevin Haberer) and Hub (Christian Kane, a familiar face from the televison's ""Angel""), who ended up in the French Foreign Legion and had some rather unbelievable adventures with a beautiful woman named Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugier) and a dastardly Sheik (Adam Ozturk).
The story might be unbelievable, but Walter has been getting bits and pieces of Hub's special speech that he always gives to young men.  Walter is not old enough to get the whole speech yet, but the key part is apparently that being able to believe in something is important, even if what you believe in is not true.  Of course the climax of this film involves young Walter coming to understand this great truth.  This helps the message of this coming of age film work for youngsters watching the film who have neither a secondhand lion nor a pair of eccentric uncles in their lives.
While getting used to Haley Joel Osment's deeper voice is going to prove difficult for some people, the chief joy here is watching Duvall act just a bit nut and Caine lay on the American accent.  Duvall is the most eccentric of the pair but Caine has this nice ability to manipulate his brother while still seeming to play the second fiddle.  There is a rather neat payoff to what happens to Walter when he grows up as a result of this rather unique childhood but the film really does not have time to let us enjoy that at the end of the film.  It will, however, compel you to watch the credits for a few additional tidbits.",1079654400,4,4046,4.380507343124165

What kept it from being great was the director and the editor.  I wanted more interaction between the kid and his uncles to justify his deep feeling for them at the end.  Another ten minutes focusing on that aspect would not have made it too long and it would have taken it to another level.  And the greedy family that drops in could have been jettisoned entirely without notice.  You've got 2 of the best actors of our time in the lens and what I wanted was more of their daily lives and philosophies that intrigues the young boy so much.  Of course I realize that all I'm asking for may very well have ended up on the editing room floor and that would be a terrible shame to know.

This young actor more than holds his own with these two masters turning in a stellar performance of a youth moving through adolescence.  Great supporting performances, especially from the lion.

A boy gets dumped with his uncles my his mom for duo reasons of, 1. so mom can go to Las vegas and party her life away, and 2. So her son can learn where the uncles have hidden their fortune.
Most of the movie is the interaction and growing relationship between the boy and his mysterous and interesting uncle.  He is told a tail of great adventure, which he may believe in or not believe in.  There is also a love story involving uncle Hub.
There is not cursing, nudity, simulated sex or spurting blood, so this movie is family safe.
This is a 3 star, good, movie that makes you smile and feel good.  The way the adventure and love story are laid out reminded me a little of Princess Bride, which is a WOW 5 star movie.

1964243,4,B0000YTP02,"This starts out with what might be the perfect 50's era adolescent nightmare - a fourteen year old boy is dropped (dumped) by his mother in the care of her elderly (old coot) uncles... no phone... no tv... with nothing but gardening for ""fun"".  Add to that the fact that the uncle's (played by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) preferred method of fishing relies on the use of shotguns.  The same shotguns provide a not so friendly reception for any traveling salesmen that might drive past the numerous signs of warning along the dirt road leading to their farmhouse.
Caine and Duvall are two brothers that have returned to Texas from a 40 year absence of mystery and adventure, reputedly with a vast fortune obtained through (take your pick) chicanery, theft, deception or worse.  Eccentrics with a capital ""E"", all we know about them for sure is that they have an indeterminate amount of money, an independent nature and little use for the rest of the modern world.  Some people might criticize Caine's attempt at a Texas twang, however what would you expect from a native Texan that's spent the previous 40 years in Morocco, Kenya and other parts unknown?
Haley Joel Osment plays ""the kid"" who is torn between issues of abandonment,  confusion (who are these bizarre old men really?), curiosity (where is their money and how much is there?), and pure wonder (can their stories be true in any way?).  Kyra Sedgwick is his mother, who quickly telescopes her real priorities by beginning every letter or converstation with ""how are you doing, have you found the money yet?""
Secondhand Lions (yes, there is some substance behind the title), didn't seem to get the attention that it deserved during it's theatrical release, and I hope that it finds a larger following in the more forgiving market of DVD and video.  It's a very enjoyable comedy that will appeal to everyone in the family, a little overly sentimental in some respects; a lot outlandish in others, but it makes for great light entertainment!",1078790400,15,2004,4.825072886297376

Then it fell apart. I kept feeling as thought it had been condensed from a much longer film (or book). After watching the movie, I viewed the alternate/deleted scenes. Oh my God! The director must have shot a different version of virtually every scene in the film! Many of the alternates would've led to a COMPLETELY different film. There is even a (much longer) alternate ending. I feel that the director/writer lacked the confidence to commit to one storyline or message and just filmed every idea that came into his head, only to try to sort it out later. The final film reflects that lack of consistency. This is one case of where the included ""extras"" actually lowered my opinion of the finished film.",1078790400,8,883,4.525
1964245,5,B0000YTP02,"I have read many other reviews on this movie and most of them miss the mark by about 2476 miles (according to my gps). Second Hand Lions is a movie about the importance of mentorship and how much so little can mean to a young soul growing up in an ever confusing world. Sometimes the right gaze, look, touch, or smile can send someone on to their destiny. What a great gift to have been given by our Lord, the power to inspire.
Walter is a young teenager living with his mother that has done nothing in her life but bounce from one man to the other. She is a pathological liar with no concept of the truth, she believes her own lies and rationalizes them in any way she deems appropriate. May (Walters Mother) drops him off at his great uncles home for the summer while once again, she is off on an escapade while claiming to be at Court Reporting school in Fort Worth.
Now Walter's two Uncles are two true characters of the world having lived long full lifes. These days however, they both feel somewhat depleted and useless while they just pass the time away waiting for their own endings.
Robert Duvall is playing one of the great uncles, Hub, who feels his life is over as he lost the love of his life over 40 years ago. Hub is a hard core soul that tells it like it is and you cannot help but respect that quality. Michael Caine is playing Walters other great uncle, Garth, who is a little bit more of a thinker than a reactor, and see's his brother killing himself before his time. Although Garth has attempted to ease Hub's pain, he is unable to break through the hard exterior of a man that has fought so many wars in his life, he knows only one way.
That brings us to the young Walter being played by Haley Joel Osment (the kid that see's dead people in the Sixth Sense). Walter is a young wide open kid who is only seeking honesty and love. One night Walter explains to Hub that he has been told so many lies in his life, he has to have the truth (Walter has questions about how Hub and Garth obtained their wealth as everyone in town has their own opinion on this). But, Hub explains to the young Walter, what is true may not be as important as what we choose to believe in. He tells the young man the most important things that you should always believe in, no matter what.
In the end, Walter has his questions answered about his uncles and where they acquired their much debated wealth. It is a moment that we have all lived for, but few have seldom received. A truly happy hopeful movie, a movie of faith.

I don't agree with other reviewers that the final scene should have been cut--the line by the little Middle Eastern boy at the end brings the entire story full circle and makes an important statement about Arab-American relations. The scene closes the story and is not, in my opinion, simply put in to be P.C.-but please see it yourself and decide.
Highly recommended.

The boy loves these stories and loves his uncles' adventuresome spirit, but begins to doubt the truth of their claims when his mother returns and casts suspicion upon the uncles' character.

1964251,4,B0000YTP02,"In a weathered old house in a lonely part of Texas,  sometime in the 1950s, there lives two equally weathered old men. They sit on their front porch drinking ice tea, chewing tobacco, and waiting around to shoot at any traveling salesmen who might venture down their long lane.
""They say they got millions stashed away-no one knows how they got it..."" May Caldwell tells her son Walter (Osment), just before she leaves him with these great uncles for a few months.
""You want them to like me so they'll die and leave us their money?""
So it seems. Walter,  a quiet boy of 14 or so, who has spent his life trailing round after his mother, soon finds that Uncle Hub (Robert Duvall) and Uncle Garth (Michael Caine) are something entirely outside of his experience of things.
While on the outset they seem like cranky old men who garden and fish a little, it soon becomes clear to Walter that those missing 40 years have left a definite mark on these brothers. It is while watching Uncle Hub fight invisible brigands beside the pond in the middle of the night, that Walter first learns the story of his uncles' lives.
Uncle Garth, who takes a more ready liking to young Walter, tells his nephew of the years spent in Africa fighting wars, avoiding assassins, rescuing princesses, and dealing with vengeful sheiks. Wonderful, amazing stories that paint the somewhat irritable Uncle Hub in the glowing colors of a hero.
The whole tale comes slowly, for in the present there are lions to hunt, relatives to fend off, airplanes to build, and teenagers to transform into men. At every turn the uncles prove to be both eccentric and very wise.
Walter, whose mother has rarely told him the same truth for more than a moment, has to learn to trust them. He has to learn to believe in something. He in turn shows the uncles that just because their colorful youths are spent and gone, their lives still have meaning and worth.
Just when his own life is starting to make sense, Walter discovers those hidden millions. A couple days later his mother shows up, trailing a new boyfriend. Stan is an FBI agent, and he tells Walter the truth about the uncles Walter has come to love. Stan demands to know where the stolen money is. Walter has to decide what he really is going to believe in, and how that will effect the choices he makes in life.
Although the plot of this movie is fairly predictable, the flashbacks to Africa make for an interesting twist. These are shown in a very `epic tale' fashion, with little actual dialogue and a voice over by Uncle Garth. Those sections, with all their vivid scenery and swift action balanced well with the slower, simpler story unfolding in Texas.
The events that happen in Texas are also very good-ranging from funny, to thought provoking, to life changing. We get two sides of the story-the adventures of the brothers when they were young, and then what effect those adventures have had on them and on Walter in the present.
The character of Walter was not as well realized as everything else in the movie. You don't get a very good feel for who he was before he met his uncles. His character grows, but you're not sure where he was coming from. Osment does all right with the part, but he can't put more into the character then he is given,
This is all the more obvious because the characters of Uncle Hub and Uncle Garth are so well done. The relationship between the two brothers is very well written, and you get the feeling of their entire history together. Duvall and Caine are wonderful to watch, and they really bring their characters to life. It is they who make up the backbone of the movie and give the largest sense of believability to the story.
On the whole, this is a good a movie that I think both kids and adults would enjoy. It manages to be highly amusing and yet offers some real truths about life.

Fortunately, this movie is NOT what it seems. For starters, I think Haley Joel Osment is preparing himself to be the next Jude Law. Far from a one-hit wonder or child-actor who transitions poorly, the kid keeps amazing me with his outstanding performances in films (maybe Michael Caine just wanted to be in the same movie with him). Then we have the always awesome Caine and the always solid Duvall.
This should be enough to make for a good movie. But wait! There's more! Not only that, but when these two old-timers start telling stories, the movie totally shifts gears. The flash-back sequences take on a life of their own. Harkening back to the old-school adventure films of the 20's and 30's, these sequences feature great action, adventure, vivid visuals, great cinematography, and a healthy dose of humor.
This film features compelling characters (and great performances by all), tells a heartfelt entertaining story, is wonderfully filmed, and features some wildly entertaining comic scenes (when Caine and Duvall want to shoot a salesman and the kid tells them to wait and see what he's selling, one of them replies that they'll let him go ahead and show them...and THEN they'll shoot him).

It stars Haley Joel Osment, who never makes a mistake when he chooses to do a film. He has amazing screen presence, and what's even more amazing is that he's a child actor. Robert Duvall and Michael Caine also star as his two Rough Around The Edges uncles. These three together prove to be an awesome combination, Osment probably being the only child actor that can stand up to the abilities of these two screen legends.
Osment plays Walter, who is dumped off one summer by his mother to find out where his uncles have been the past forty years, but more importantly, to find the millions of dollars they supposedly have stashed away. Not only do we get the story of Walter and his two uncles, we also get the backstory of where they were all those years and how they came across their fortune. Flashback scenes are hard to do without seeming hokey, but these are done well and tell the exact kind of story that a twelve year old boy would want to hear. Christian Kane stars as the young Uncle Hub, and though he hardly talks at all throughout the flashbacks, he's the main reason the flashbacks are so amazing.
I definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great movie because this movie has everything anyone could hope for when seeing a film-- comedy, sword fights, airplane acrobatics, and a secondhand lion. SO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",1078272000,2,1547,4.5088967971530245

Others have posted the basic plot, so I'll not repeat it except to reaffirm the overall opinion that this is a great film.

It was fun.
If I had any problems, they would be with the editing. While I agreed with most of the decisions, there were a couple of scenes cut that should have stayed in. Garth filling out the junk mail forms, for instance, and checking ""yes, send a salesman by."" That was poignant and would have added to the characterization without overextending the length of the film.

It has plenty of fantasy and action that is not overwhelming for young ones and still makes its points for adults.  The film advocates values of honesty, courage, devotion, love, and overcoming differences.
The plot involves a young boy being deposited (really) on two bachelor uncles whom he doesn't know by a mother with rather casual values.  There are lots of rumors about these strange men and they don't want the boy, but they reluctantly accept him for awhile.
Of course the boy has to grow on the men and they learn from each other.  It turns out that the reality about the men is more extravagant than the rumors and the lion they originally bought to kill for its hide ends up being an apt symbol for these men in the boy's life.
I don't want to say more about the plot to let you discover its details for yourself.  I do want to say that Caine, Duvall, Osment, and Sedgwick are all fine in their roles.

The performance are tremendous in this movie, featuring Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Haley Osment.  Watching all the characters mature in their relationships is a great film-viewing experience.

1964263,4,B0000YTP02,"""Secondhand Lions"" is an excellent laugh-out-loud comedy starring Michael Caine, Robert DuVall, and Haley Joel Osment.  Its humor and wild action scenes keeps audiences interested in every second.  The writers also know the perfect scenes to add a pinch of drama, yet never stopping the laughs.  The displicted unique way of living is only one way the laughs keep coming.  Its plot of a boy whose mom drops him off at his two great-uncles' house and discovers secrets never known to any other is brilliant.  The eye-popping scenes continue happening unexpectedly, namely the rumor about the great-uncles being former bank robbers, the two shooting bullets around salesmen to scare them off, and the revealing of a former love affair.  All turn of events keep audiences questioning: are the circulated rumors a misunderstanding, or are they true criminals?  As audiences continue watching, they discover that few past events are what they originally appear to be.  Such affect keeps them watching interestingly closer.
All actors offer their own humor into every word.  Michael Caine and Robert DuVall play wonderful great-uncles.  They prove that they've never lost their acting touch after many years within their careers.  Haley Joel Osment continues to amaze audieces with his great talents.  He proves in his role that he's one of the best child actors of modern-day.  The chemistry within the trio is heavily present.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.
""Secondhand Lions"" makes a great, unique comedy for all ages.  This is sure to please a variety of audiences.",1077062400,2,1588,5.196850393700787

1964265,5,B0000YTP02,"Story focuses on a boy literally dumped off by his ""good for nothin'"" opportunist mom on the doorsteps of two brothers (great uncles to the boy). She hopes he will discover where the uncles have stashed an enormous amount of cash so that she and her son can reap or enjoy the bountiful treasure. Everyone wants the hidden loot ( from conniving nasty relatives, all- to- eager stock-investment and intrusive insurance dealers to  trespassing salesmen---none of them are welcomed on the men's property ).You can literally see the dollar signs in these people's eyes flashing and hear cha-ching in the background in a sort of cartoonesque manner. Meanwhile the two men literally raise young Walter and teach him valuable lessons on how to be a man and about life in general through their daily actions, heart to heart speeches and Indiana Jones-like flashbacks of the uncles' escapades as young men in their prime. One of the uncles also tells Walter about the secret or method he lives by to attaining faith and belief in the truth (or what he perceives to be the truth) to anything in life. The love -is- what- is- most- important (love conquers all)lesson gets interwoven into one of the talks as well. However, rumor has it that the men may have acquired the money through bank robbery heists or as hit men for the mafia...Do in fact the men even possess such a vastly hidden wealth ? And why were they absent for 40 years from their hometown and then re-emerge? Are they feeding Walter delusional stories of grandeur about their early days as swashbucklers as a cover up to some hidden secret or to just pass the time ?... I highly suggest you rent this dvd or even buy it to see what happens !
Whether this film may be syrupy or sappy for some, it made me feel good just seeing it. I had my preconceived notions about this film and one of those notions was that it was going to be a saccharine inducing comatose viewing experience. Wrong. With grand actors like Duvall and Caine and Osment's proven acting ability (The Sixth Sense anyone?...) you know you are going to get your entertainment's value worth...
 Caine, Duvall and Osment along with Sedgewick do an outstanding job that really brings this movie to life. Almost everyone has raved about the performances by the first three actors. Kira Sedgewick turns in one that is a fine semi- comedic performance. However, the character as a worthless mother and scheming con artist will not endear anyone. Her stupid and insensitive actions and ravings make one hope that she gets all she deserves and then some. At first, one wants to feel sorry for her character as a supposedly struggling single mother; but when she uses her own child for a scam all sympathetic sentiments are off !  Very entertaining colorful characters and performances ! While there was some drama there was also a good dose of comedic wit by Duvall and Caine (in some scenes the most subtlest of ways)! Even the story flashbacks took a jab at the Indiana Jones films but with a much light hearted homage.
This is excellent entertaining family fodder. My last thought about Second Hand Lions is that this would also make a great dvd to view or to buy for someone on Father's Day due to  seeing the paternal-like relationship between the uncles and the boy ! Whatever message or meaning you can derive from Second Hand Lions it is all positive and good in a clean and wholesome familial sense not found in many movies these days.",1077062400,3,3455,4.668308702791461

Secondhand Lions has the same structure (is that life story for real ?) only I got hooked within the first 8 minutes and was disapointed when it was over : I would have taken a lot more of this heart warming sunnysideup kind of story about the coming of age of a young boy.  Until the moment one summer day he was brought like a piece of luggage to his 2 uncles'  farm in the middle of nowhere in the early 1960's in Texas, the boy seemed to have had no father, only a mother drifting from one loser boyfriend to the next. But this time he lands at a hero and his brother's dying home. All three of them will be saved by this unpredictible gasp of destiny.  A film for the hero story lovers (going from the Star Wars series to the Fisher King). Not for cynics, especialy those who do not understand how a myth works. - For those, The Power of Myth series should be viewed first !

But are the eccentric, wild, free-spirited uncles' tall tales real  or are they meant to cover a dreadful life of robbing banks?  Kind of sappy and contrived but still fun and full of visual invention.  Caine and Duvall effortlessly do their thing and Osment is believable as a boy who learns valuable lessons while having the summer adventure of his life.  Not the great film the screenwriter assumes in his commentary and interview, but an OK entry in the increasingly rare family film category.",1076630400,4,667,4.824561403508772
1964277,3,B0000YTP02,"Perception is a powerful, but misleading tool in the arsenal of human discovery.  It can lead to a lot of discovery but can also mislead.  Sometimes we can look at an old man, see nothing but a man past his prime, and we forget the life that he led.  Sometimes we can look at an innocent, weak young boy and forget that this boy could one day be a man with lots of power.  SECONDHAND LIONS is a film about perception and whether we, the audience, know what is true or not.
Walter (Haley Joel Osmet, The Sixth Sense) is a young boy without any direction.  His mother (Kyra Sedgwick, Personal Velocity) is flighty and incredibly selfish.  We she seizes on an opportunity to meet a new man she drops Walter off at her great-uncles', to spend the summer with them.
Those men are named Garth (Michael Caine, Little Voice) and Hub (Robert Duvall, The Apostle).  The rumor is they have a large sum of money, and Walter's mother seems to think that if he gets all buddy- buddy with them, maybe that small fortune could one day become theirs.  Walter is in for the summer of his life.  A summer full of crazy adventures, a giraffe in a cornfield, swashbuckling, riveting stories of adventure, beautiful princesses, and of course, a lion named Jasmine.
SECONDHAND LIONS is the kind of film I love.  Sure it's light and fluffy, but it's also filled with interesting characters and surprises around every corner.  It's a fantasy without being a cartoon, a farce with a little bit of heart.  It does something very few films attempt these days.  It inspires true imagination.
Of course I have some minor squabbles.  The film overstays it's welcome.  Creating an ending that is far too sentimental and far too forced.  After the self-discovery, you want to leave the characters to just be.  SECONDHAND LIONS just sits there like a lump, giving us endless shots of the older Walter (Josh Lucas) and an old cop talking about the past.  I would have preferred the film end by keeping us guessing.  But alas, it has to answer the one question that lets the rest of the story down: Are the old stories true?
Duvall and Caine are incredibly charming as Garth and Hub.  Their men with more stories to tell, and yet they won't tell you unless you ask.  They have this sarcastic wit about them that propels the story further.  I loved the scene where Duvall's character beats up the teenagers.  How cocky do some of us young people think we are?  It's nice to be put in our place by a man with so many years behind his belt.  Caine knows the score and plays the straight man with a subtle grace.  I like how he deals with Duvall.  How the characters feel like brothers, and not like two men acting.
Writer/Director Tim McCanlies (Dancer, Texas Pop 81) has created a film that is both watch able and enchanting all at the same time.  He captures rural Texas as a dustbowl of boredom, with magic hiding in the corn.  My favorite shot is that of this tall giraffe that rides into focus on a flatbed truck.  I loved how incredibly silly that thought was.
SECONDHAND LIONS is worth a trip to the cinema.  It's worth a night curled up by a warm fire.  Sure, it's not the greatest of these kinds of movies, but for that I recommend you sit down with THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.  If you're looking for a safe and sweet trip into the past, or you love run-ins with lions, give this SECONDHAND LION a try.

1964278,5,B0000YTP02,"Tim McCanlies (writer/director) knows how to serve up a thoroughly entertaining yarn and in his SECONDHAND LIONS he succeeds at every level.  The story (two idiosyncratic privacy-demanding old geezer/brothers are abruptly forced into the care of a kid whose been tossed about by a dream-chasing mother - and the results of cohabitation for a summer of mutual changes) has been told before but not so well.  It doesn't hurt to have the classic acting talents of Robert DuVall and Michael Caine as the brothers, the still developing talent of Haley Joel Osment as the kid, and the always fine Kyra Sedgwick as the ditsy mother in the leading roles.  Toss in a gaggle of the most loveable pets (a pig, several dogs and even a she-lion), who bond with Osment in listening to the glorious tales of the early days of the brothers in the French Foreign Legion, and the chemistry is terrific.  Whether the tall tales of the brothers are based on reality or imagination is up to the viewer (and Osment) to decide and one of the many wise bits of philosophy in the movie comes from Caine who feels as long as you believe, then the 'reality' is secondary.  Watching these two old loners gradually grow into a close, caring relationship with the boy is what fell-good family movies are able to do in assisting parents to encourage growth of the heart as well as the mind during those terrifying years of adolescence.  Here is a film that is funny, filled with exotic action, has a moral, and in essence is just a fine little movie.",1076371200,6,1519,4.628252788104089

When I watched it what stuck to my mind is that, for a person to show their love, self love is very important. Not exactly the self love that one becomes selfish. Something that we have to take care of ourselves by living a clean lifestyle, being careful, eating the proper food, etc., to prolong life because our love ones will benefit from it because there will be a longer/more time for them to be together.

Who wouldn't enjoy a movie about two old war-horses sitting on their porch during retirement, blasting their shotguns at every two-bit salesperson who comes along to take a crack at their well-hidden wealth?  The movie is supposed to be about learning to trust, and the importance of believing in good things, even if they may not actually be true, i.e. ""good always triumphs over evil"".  But it's not all serious drama.  It's presented in a way that will keep you laughing the whole time.",1076284800,11,642,4.556521739130435
1964281,4,B0000YTP02,"I did not see this film in theaters in part because it just looked kind of simplistic and dumb to me. However, a friend of my wife's raved about it so we checked it out this weekend.
I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Given the pedigree of the actors involved, it was probably a no-brainer that it would be well-acted, even though I'm not a fan of Robert Duvall. But Duvall actually gives a rather restrained performance, which is surprising because he is playing an over-the-top character. Caine is almost underused, but the intent seems to be for his character to fill that role. As we learn, Hub (Robert Duvall) has always been the adventuring thrill-seeker, while Garth (Michael Caine) frequently was just along for the ride.
Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is unceremoniously dumped by his mother (Kyra Sedgwick) on his great uncles, Hub and Garth. Hub and Garth apparently disappeared for a forty year period and now have re-emerged in retirement somewhere in Texas. They are rumored to be hiding millions of dollars and a big part of their entertainment each day is the appearance of traveling salesmen whom they generally chase off by shooting at them. Part of Walter's marching orders from his mother are to find out where the money is hidden.
Naturally, no one gets along at first, but eventually Walter and his uncles clearly come to love one another as they become his surrogate parents. Garth begins to tell Walter stories of what happened to them over that forty year period, fantastic tales of adventures in the French Foreign Legion, battles with slave traders, and outsmarting a sheik to gain their fortune. He also learns that Hub is deeply troubled by the death of the woman he loved, Jasmine, and Walter must eventually summon the courage to question his intimidating Uncle Hub about what happened to Jasmine.
Life has become fairly idyllic for Walter, including becoming the owner of a scruffy old lioness, when his mother reappears with a boyfriend who is determined to find the money. The boyfriend claims to be a private detective who has learned that Hub and Garth are actually bank robbers. Walter is forced to make some tough decisions, along the way drawing inspirations from his uncles who may or may not be what he though they were.
Okay, there are a few plot wholes. For one thing, the bulk of the story appears to be taking place in the sixties and Hub and Garth started their adventuring in 1914, on the eve of World War I. Maybe it's actually taking place in the fifties, I don't know my cars well enough to pin a date down based on the models of cars appearing in the film. Regardless, it seems they would at least be in their late teens in 1914. And both act as if they are already well into old age when Walter meets them. Its just real hard to figure out how old they actually are and the timelines just do not seem to work.
The ending also stretches disbelief just a little too much, but go with it anyway. Hub and Garth apparently had some fantastic adventures, so why not an ending that places an exclamation point on those adventures? Just go with it, okay? Don't do what I typically do and start analyzing every thing, you'll ruin it for yourself.
As noted, the acting throughout is first rate. The story is one of those that can bring a tear to your eye (unless you're a total cynic you'll probably at least get a lump in your throat), and you'll probably be amazed at some of the scenes that appear during Garth's story-telling sequences. This was probably a film that had a relatively modest budget, but they do a great job evoking scenes that are apparently from Europe, Morocco, and other far away lands. Not everyone will like it, just take a look at some of the previous reviews, but I think most people will find it to be a fun, enjoyable film.
Heck, after having rented it, I'm planning to buy it now.",1076284800,2,3855,4.58840579710145
1964282,5,B0000YTP02,"If you are a dreamer and enjoy a bit of fantasy in your life, this is a movie you should enjoy.  It brings exceptional actors together with a wondrous story.  A young boy is dropped with two bachelor uncles to spend a few weeks while his mother supposedly is attending a court reporting school.  She actually just wants to be unencumbered for the latest boyfriend.  The uncles aren't too happy with the situation, but allow the lad to stay.  He soon discovers that these old guys have different ways to spend their time, from taking potshots at salesmen who drive up, hoping to make a big sale to supposedly rich men, to shooting at fish in the pond.
Haley Osment settles in and learns to adjust to a life on a farm without television.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are truly gifted as they play curmudgeons with a past.  Just what is the past?  Only they know for sure.  The other relatives and the neighbors believe they are bank robbers, but Uncle Garth tells adventurous tales of life with the Foreign Legion, patrolling the Saharan sands, where Hub fell in love with a beautiful girl named Jasmine.
The lion arrives when the uncles decide they would like to shoot a lion.  It gets turned loose accidentally and heads for the corn patch, where it feels safe.  Garth points out that the corn patch is probably the closest thing to a jungle this cat has ever seen.  It certainly is, as lions actually live in the savanna, not the jungle.  However, the tall corn would also be comforting to a cat seeking tall grass to shelter in.  The lion turns out to be tame, and the uncles let it stay as a pet.
You must watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, as points are explained there that should have remained in the movie.  The reason salesmen keep coming - Garth fills out coupons requesting that a salesman call about the product.  There is also a sentimental alternate ending.  The boy grows up to be a cartoonist, (drawings by Berk Breathed), raised by the uncles after he has a showdown with his mother about her way of life.
Everything turns out the way it should, the actors are tremendous, and it just doesn't get any better than this.  The only clunker is the biplane wreckage, which was poorly faked.  It looks like pieces of kite instead of wreckage.",1076198400,,2258,4.503685503685504

Secondhand Lions is a young ""coming of age"" film in the style of Princess Bride (1987), which reaches the audience with its serious message through the use of far-fetched adventures and lessons in dialogue.

It wasn't until I turned the DVD over and found the proper, correct ending for the movie!
What microcephalic, idiot-studying-hard-to-become-a-moron-and-failing-the-course-miserably, non-entity decided to leave THAT particular ending on the ""B"" side instead of in the movie???!!! The other ""deleted"" or ""alternate endings"" should have remained in the movie instead of being put in the ""Special Features"" of the DVD!!!
I am amazed that this is the film they showed the public! Oh, don't get me wrong - the choice of the cast was superb; the setting, effects, etc., etc. - and I really did enjoy the movie - I was just disappointed in the way the movie ended.
It is my most fervent hope that the director, Tim McCanlies, will decide to release a special ""Director's Cut"" of this movie, putting back the proper ending to make this movie complete! If it looks like this will come to pass, I will, most definitely, buy it for my collection!
Finally, when all is said and done, I would still recommend this movie to anyone! It was really enjoyable to see a movie without a screaming RAP score, lots of gratuitous sex, and completely inappropriate language! I thought Hollywood forgot how to make those types of movie!

It embodies the ideals of courage, spirit, honesty, and love. But what really made this movie great to me was what Uncles Garth & Hub taught young Walter. Which is to live your life without fear, with bravery, with fun, and to not be afraid to act like a man. To be wild at heart and to fight for those things that we should believe in even if they are not true. The animals in this movie are fantastic as well. This is a great family movie. I have seen reviews from some parents/viewers up North who were uncomfortable about the film's showing of our Texas gun culture but those yankees will never understand anyway.

1964292,4,B0000YTP02,"I'm always cynical with family movie especially with those cheesy moments, over the top soundtrack.  Still, I decided to give this movie a go.  I guess it's the top-rated actors in this movie that convinced me that it's worth my while.  Every time those actors acted in movies, their career is on the line.  Any bad or fair reviews upon their performances would have dented their reputation somewhat.  Look at Kevin Costner, from his heyday of ""Dances with Wolves"", he gradually sank into oblivion by involving himself in a few duds such as ""Waterworld"", ""Postman"".  Naturally, ""Secondhand Lions"" was about a matured-beyond-his-age nephew in the form of Joel Osmont who went to stay with his long lost uncles in the forms of Michael Caine & Robert Duvall.  At first, both parties were skeptical about one another.  The nephew was scared & at the same time bewildered by the uncles who shot at salespeople as a hobby, concocting their own version of fishing by blowing the fish off the water.  The uncles themselves were a mystery.  There was this rumour that they stacked away hordes of money & they lived a lifestyle that were considered an acquired taste for some.  As both parties started to warm to one another, they started to open up their hearts to one another.  The nephew was as keen as a mustard to learn about their past filled with adventures in exotic land.  Whether the uncles told the truth or not would only be revealed towards the end.  Anyhow, the adventures were told in a ""once upon a time"" fashion & it was moment like that we knew we were indulged with a family story.  The essence of the story is that to hell with life...live it, as long as you have your boots on.  Truth to be told, it's a very heart-warming movie with those tender moment & not forgetting those hillarious moment of a literal lion that roamed the corn field, a pig that thought it was a dog.  I feel what made this family movie a cut above the rest is the effortless performance of those actors mentioned.  Kyra Sedgewick is convincing as Joel's character's mum for ending up with loser boyfriend all the time, and the male teacher (with his inner demon problem)in TV series, ""Boston High"" is Kyra's character's boyfriend in this instance.

The story revolves around a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who gets ditched at his two great uncles' house while his trampy mother supposedly goes back to school. There, the boy begins to learn about his uncles and their exciting past. The stories are far-fetched, yet that's the way they're supposed to be. Later, the boy has to decide whether or not the stories are fact or fiction when conflicts begin to arise. It's a very enjoyable movie. Great family viewing.",1069545600,2,654,4.598290598290598
1964311,5,B0000YTP02,"Its great to know movies like this are still being made. Second Hand Lions has come and gone in the box office, finishing in the ""warm hit"" category receiving nearly $42 million at the box office. Unfortunately, even though those numbers are decent, nowadays its kind of ""eh"". I have to say, this movie should have made triple its earnings.
Robert Duvall and Micheal Caine (This is no shocker) give fantastic performances as grouchy, mysterious, old uncles. Many questions arise: They may or may not have robbed the most powerful Sahib in Arabia...Their ability to buy anything they wish shows they have oodles of money hidden somewhere, but where? Are they former bank robber's, retired to the comfort's of the old farm? Confused? So is their Nephew, when he is dropped in their laps during hard times. He takes it upon himself to find out the details of his Uncles former lives.
Its Been cool watching Haley Joel Osment go from practically a baby in Forrest Gump, to a child star in Sixth Sense, on to a smashing performance in A.I. Now we see him as a pubescent, voice cracking, young teen. At first I didn't think they could fit his square pegged (practically massive persona acting-wise) into this round hole (simple, yet complicated role), but after watching just a few scenes, my reservations melted away.
Just as the Granpa in PRINCESS BRIDE would probably say this story is one of: ""War, Romance, True Love, Villains, Revenge..."" The list goes on. At the end of the film, and this is a nice touch, they don't quite seal the package - answer every single question. Fine by me.

The characters are real, and they unfold through a story that is unique. Touching without being radically sentimental.
Other reviewers here are too busy noting that Haley is growing up and that Michael isn't a Texan to appreciate the overall effect of this movie. Yes, it has a couple of flaws here and there. Haley is actually the catalyst, not the star. The story is presented through his eyes, how he saw the uncles and their world. He is in awe because it is a very different world than his. Caine and Duvall make a wonderful pair.
Both kids and grown-ups can truly enjoy this comedy, not the slapstick kind but one that stems from the idiosynchrasies of character. I could see it perhaps 2-3 times without getting bored. Highly recommended for a great family outing!",1066521600,4,933,4.765432098765432
1964327,4,B0000YTP02,"This was a great movie.  I just saw it last night -- for the second time.  With Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osment, how could they go wrong?  But there's many a film out there that boasts a multi-talented all-star cast and yet still fails to deliver the goods.
SECONDHAND LIONS is not one of them.
The story is about young Walter who is just barely in his teens and is sent to live with his two great uncles.  He constantly hears rumors of their hidden treasure that they stole from Al Capone, or took from a wealthy Arab, or obtained through a lawsuit, or...whatever you want to believe.  Throughout the movie, Walter learns from his uncles, Hub and Garth, how to grow into a man and what the truly important things are in life; and Garth and Hub learn from Walter how to enjoy life to the fullest.
The drama here is fantastic, and only once does the emotionalism get a little over-the-top (which is why I gave it four stars instead of five).  The acting is fantastic.  In this adventurous film you'll be reminded of images of INDIANA JONES, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, among many others.
...
I wish every goofball (i.e. summer blockbuster) filmmaker in Hollywood -- you know, the ones that think creative filmmaking means having alot of CGI characters jumping around on skyscrapers and fighting villains in Power Ranger suits -- would simply sit down and watch SECONDHAND LIONS.  Then they would know how to make a good movie.",1065744000,173,1437,4.607843137254902
1964328,4,B0000YTP02,"SECONDHAND LIONS is a film that one may enjoy for its quirkiness, or hate for its cuteness. I fall into the former group.
As the film opens, young Walter (Haley Joel Osmont) is deposited unannounced on the rural doorstep of his bachelor grand uncles, Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall), by his single-mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick). Mae is ostensibly off to the big city to attend Court Reporting School, but she has a history of lying to her son. Garth and Hub have recently surfaced after a forty-year absence. It's rumored that the two eccentric geezers have millions of dollars hidden somewhere on their property. Traveling salesman and relatives all want a piece of the action, and Garth and Hub habitually drive the former off with shotguns. Mae hopes that Walter's stay with the two will mature the boy, who's a bit of a wimp. And his secondary assignment is, of course, to find the treasure. Mae herself is not Good Housekeeping's role model for Mom. As she strides towards her surprised uncles (who are out in a boat shooting fish), one asks the other, ""Did you order a hooker?"". Enough said.
Hub is an older and much crustier version of Duvall's Gus McCrae seen in 1989's LONESOME DOVE. When Hub advises Walter on what it is that a boy his age should believe in, it's vintage Gus. But this is a good thing since McCrae was, in my opinion, the greatest role of Duvall's distinguished career.
I can't help but feel that Caine was miscast. It's not that he's bad at it, but his Garth persona pales to a nondescript blandness beside Duvall's Hub. This is Duvall's vehicle; no doubt about it. Garth has two purposes in the plot - to act as Hub's straight man in the now, and to tell Walter the tale of Hub's past. As Garth relates, both fought in the French Foreign Legion at the outbreak of WWI. After that, they remained in Africa, where Hub fought slavers and won and lost a desert beauty, Princess Jasmine.
At one point, Hub and Garth acquire ownership of a ""secondhand lion"", presumably purchased from a circus. The beast is old and pretty much useless, much like Hub sees himself at this late stage in his life after decades of living on the edge.
A significant part of SECONDHAND LIONS involves flashbacks that accompany Garth's tale of his and his brother's swashbuckling past. These scenes, in which Hub and Garth are played by younger actors, resemble the comic book adventures designed in bygone eras for young males. This isn't unreasonable since the setting of the plot's ""now"" is apparently in the late 50s or early 60s.
Despite my misgivings about Caine's inclusion in the cast - perhaps Tommy Lee Jones, Duvall's co-star in LONESOME DOVE, might have better suited - and an ending that seemed overly-contrived and which literally dropped out of the sky, I liked this film for its offbeat and whimsical storyline that proved to be an effective tale of Growing Up. I wish I'd had uncles like Garth and Hub. There are no Academy Award nominations here, but go see it anyway.",1065484800,2,2998,4.669187145557656
1964329,5,B0000YTP02,"As this film opens, a sullen fourteen year old Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is about to be deposited with his two gruff and irascible old uncles against his will by his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) while she supposedly pursues her education and a career. Hub and Garth McCann, played respectively by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, are no more enamored of the arrangement than is Walter, but an uneasy truce occurs between them as Walter comes to understand their eccentricities and in fact serves as somewhat of an outlet for Garth's desire to settle down somewhat in his final years. One of the elements twhich makes the film a true delight is the extreme nature of the antics of these  ""old men"", whether it is shooting at traveling salesmen for fun or alienating their relatives to maintain their solitude. The backdrop to the story is that Hub and Garth are rumored to be quite wealthy; and in fact Walter's mother instructs him to attempt to locate the source and location of their supposed wealth. (Perhaps the mafia, or bank robberies, or the foreign legion?)
As Walter settles in with them and their numerous dogs (and a pig who thinks he's a dog),  the ""plot suddenly thickens"" as Hub acts strangely and Walter discovers mysterious evidence of a beautiful young woman somewhere in their history. Garth tells Walter a fantastic tale of foreign adventure and intrigue involving Hub and the enchanting princess Jasmine, and the story is actually incorporated into the movie in the form of the adventure epics of fifty years ago with Emanuelle Vaugier playing the role of Hub's lost love. Meanwhile, some ""used"" circus animals arrive, including a tired and sick old lion who Walter nurses back to health as he enjoys the ""jungle"" habitat provided by the corn field that has emerged from their failed attempt to grow a vegetable garden. The movie reaches a wonderful climax as the forces of good confront the forces of evil (true comic book style) and Walter is forced to confront the fact that life is full of surprises, not all of which include happy endings, and that we have to be strong enough to accept unpleasant truths and move on.
But, of course, any description of the plot doesn't convey the appeal of this film; the storyline is simply the backdrop for the life which is infused into this movie by the superb performances of the stars, the excellent directing, and the way in which the story unfolds. It is fun yet touching, with enough elements of the unexpected interspersed with truly laugh out loud humorous incidents to make the almost two hours fly by. It's hard to know who is more appealing, those old second hand lions Robert Duvall and Michael Caine (who put their superb talents to use in a film they have stated that they really enjoyed making) or Jasmine, the circus lion who late in life was destined for her moment of glory. And the story has a marvelous symmetry, both in the juxtaposition of the opening and closing scenes and in the brief appearance of Josh Lucas as the adult Walter. Finally, the climatic moment is followed by a gradual conclusion to the story which incorporates a truly wonderful finale.
In some aspects this is a far from perfect film; in some respects it would be easy to write a critical review detailing the fact that the plot was pure fantasy and that no attempt was made to seriously address many of the issues which the movie raises. But such criticisms would not be consistent with the mood which the movie evoked for me and the remainder of the audience. This movie is about life, about its surprises and its enjoyment, and as corny as it is it is also great fun. I enjoyed it so much that I have chosen to ignore one of my personal reviewing rules; I decided to round up my rating to five stars in spite of the fact that I haven't decided if it is good enough so that I will want to own the DVD. I know that I'll enjoy watching it several more times and decided that was good enough. So, go see this lighthearted film when you want to smile and laugh and feel good about life and it will confirm that whether you're old or a teenager it's still possible to learn and grow and have a good time.

1964331,5,B0000YTP02,"This is A great and absolutely astonishing movie.
I had relatively low expectations when I went with my mom and a friend of hers to see ""Secondhand Lions"". I had never heard of such a movie until then.
However, I had no idea that this movie would completely blow all my expectations out of the water and into orbit around the Earth but it sure did just that! This is one of the best movies to have come out so far in 2003, a relatively lousy year for movies saved only by ""Finding Nemo"", ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""X-Men United"". It is definitely on its way to becoming one of the top 10 movies of the year and it definitely deserves so.
(Warning: Minor Spoilers ahead)
The story is a coming of age tale that begins in the Texas countryside in the 1960s with a shy, highly introverted, and near-adolescent boy named Walter who has becoming increasingly distant from his often inept and neglectful mother Mae and is angry with the endless river of lies. One day, Mae tells her son Walter that she's going to a school in Dallas, Texas and drops off her son to a dingy countryside house to stay with his wealthy but eccentric great-uncles Hub and Garth (Mae's uncles) for the summer. The Great-Uncles at first are almost completely unresponsive and somewhat unkind to Walter at first due to their estrangement from Mae but gradually they open up to Walter and then over time, they eventually open up to him and then from there, the Great-Uncles tell him about their stories of what they went through during their younger days during World War I and the adventures that they went through during the immediate years following the war.
Walter in return, becomes highly fascinated by their stories of their exotic adventures in Northern Africa and Europe but the whole belief is in danger from a corrupt state official who is accusing them of stealing millions of dollars and is trying to have a warrant for their arrests plus, Hub and Garth's wealth is being sought after by numerous relatives  living within a thousand miles of their home and now Walter is in the tense state of deciding who to believe in: His uncles' story of how they got the large stash of cash from their adventures overseas or the accusations of bank robberies from the police officers.
I think that it is so awesome the way ""Secondhand Lions"" blends sadness and tears with laughter and smiles so well.  I haven't seen a movie that has done such a great thing like this in years, that is if ever. The whole story plot while occasionally a bit thin in some areas is very strong. This fills in a gap that I feel is missing in a lot of movies: An excellent and powerful message about who to believe in and how one can re-ignite one's own as well as others' lives as well. The animals in the movie also make for some excellent additions to the story, and not just for extra laughs but for telling tales of laughter and heartbreak all in one. The only thing I have a gripe about is what happened to the pig at the ending? Did he/she end up being bacon for breakfast one morning? :/
Go and see this movie today. I haven't seen such a great and original tale in a long time like this one.",1064880000,4,3144,4.4471403812824954
1964332,5,B0000YTP02,"Secondhand Lions is a movie for almost the entire family, except for young children who might find it a little slow-moving and possibly boring.  It combines fine acting, a good story, and real values without resorting to sex and profanity.  Basically it is the story of young Walter (Haley Joel Osment), whose immature tart of a mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick), dumps him at the home of his two grand-uncles Garth (Michael Caine) & Hub (Robert Duvall).  As she leaves him, she tells him that there is a rumor that they were Mafia hit men and have a fortune hidden.  ""Look for it,"" are her last words as she takes off, ostensibly to go to the court reporting school in Fort Worth.  We eventually learn that she has dumped him before, even in an orphanage.
Garth & Hub are eccentrics who shoot at fish in the lake and at the occasional traveling salesmen who come down the road to their house.  Although they are not pleased to have the boy, they accept him.  He is horrified to learn they have no television, no telephone, no air conditioning. One day a lion is delivered to their farm.  They had hoped to hunt and kill the beast, but it is old and lazy and refuses to leave its crate.  So of course they adopt it as a pet. Some relatives who have come to try to weasel themselves into the uncles' will let the lion out, and it finds a home in the cornfield, as close as it can come to a jungle.
One night he sees Hub sleepwalking with a toilet plunger, which he brandishes like a sword.  Garth begins to tell Walter a fantastic story about their youth, in which they were shanghaied from their European travels and commandeered into the French Foreign Legion.  At this point we see the young Hub, magnificently portrayed with great panache by the handsome, mustached Christian Kane in a very energetic performance, as he fights with the Legion, often rescuing the less athletic Garth.  Afterwards he fights against slavery, falls in love with the beautiful and spunky Princess Jasmine, and battles apparently insurmountable odds to be with her, gaining a fortune in the process.
Walter & his uncles grow fond of each other, and an encounter in the general store in which Hub singlehandedly overcomes four young punks armed with knives lends credence to Garth's tale.
Mae eventually returns with a sleaze of a boy friend (Nicky Katt) who hits Walter when he refuses to reveal the hiding place of the money. Jasmine, the lion, attacks him to protect Walter.
Eventually Mae wants to take Walter home, and he must choose between life with her and life with his uncles.
The ending of the movie, which I don't want to reveal, is very satisfying.  Josh Lucas appears briefly as the adult Walter, who has become a successful cartoonist with his strip Walter & Jasmine, based on his and his uncles' lives, as they told it to him.
All of the actors did a fine job, although I wish that Kane had been allowed to speak his lines instead of using Caine's voiceover for his scenes.  I highly recommend this movie and look forward to buying the DVD.",1064880000,52,3030,4.5664206642066425

He is left on the door step of two great uncles of dubious reputation on a rundown ranch about 60 miles east of Austin, Texas.  Initially, Duvall rejects the lad but Caine sees the need in this child's eyes and accepts him as the son he never had.  Though the uncles are crude, somewhat violent and very excentric they instill basic moral values on the young man.  When his mother returns with a new boyfriend the young man reluctantly leaves with her but almost immediately returns to his uncles.  He grows into a successful man creating a comic strip of his youth and the stories his uncles told him.  The uncles eventually are killed in an airplane crash of an old biplane that Duvall was flying.  As the grown man returns to the ranch for a last look he finds out the stories his uncles told him about their past were true.

1964349,5,B0000YTP02,"The best way to describe SECONDHAND LIONS is that it's like an independent art film for families. The movie is a hodge-podge of genres and varies between the sublime to the parodical. The plot revolves around a young boy named Walter and how he ended up being raised by two crazy bachelor uncles in the mid 1960s. The uncles (played by Duvall and Caine) have been missing for forty years and have recently returned to Texas to live out the rest of their days. Rumor has it that the old coots have millions of stolen loot stashed away somewhere and every salesperson and relative within a thounsand miles is trying to get their hands on some of the cash.
Children will like this movie especially for the cheesy flashback scenes that appear to be a cross between Indiana Jones and Saturday morning cartoons. However, cheesy as those scenes appear, they fit for the purposes of the film.
The movie also has something to say about faith and honesty. In fact, this is probably the best film I've seen about faith since SIGNS. It takes faith to believe the unbelievable, but when you find out what you were believing really was true, it becomes even that much more amazing.

The little kids will like the aging lion who inhabits the cornfield, the big kids will like the adventure stories the brothers spin about their youth in the French Foreign Legion, and the grown-ups will appreciate seeing two great actors do what they can with otherwise trite material.
The movie as a whole though seems episodic and the characters only parodies:  the old men say ""lookee here"" a lot, the rest of the grown-ups are moneyhungry and selfish, the plot is unbelievable and disconnected.  It's more like a set of unrelated chapters from a kid's chapter book than a real screenplay.
My higher rating reflects acceptable quality, combined with the fact that it's so hard to find movies with something for everyone in the family to enjoy together.
