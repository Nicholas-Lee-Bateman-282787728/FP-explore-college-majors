8395473,4,B003EGWJB0,"A good movie about a historical event that I knew nothing about.  In the 1970's Korea was ruled by a military dictator who was paranoid, ruthless, and cruel.  Afraid that ""rebels"" were plotting to overthrow him, he started rounding up and imprisoning thousands of college students.  Any who resisted were shot.  This is the story of University students and townspeople who attempted to oppose him and the military.  In one confrontation
the soldiers were ordered to fire on hundreds of unarmed students.
I'm kind of embarrassed that being a young man in the 70s, I knew nothing about this.  A very eye opening movie.",1441843200,,616,4.875
8395474,2,B003EGWJB0,"The film is the film; others have reviewed it, and you can find more info about it elsewhere.  This particular DVD is given to us in 4:3, with the 16:9 original picture boxed inside the full frame.  This wouldn't be so terrible except that the subtitles are hardcoded.  So, if you have a widescreen TV, you have two choices: watch the film in full 4:3 mode, with black bars at the top, bottom, and both sides of the picture; or zoom in on your TV and lose the subtitles.  Makes this particular DVD useless except for those who know Korea, and if you know Korean than you've probably already gotten the R3 disk from Korea.

Some transfers, like Madeo, are great.  Others, like this one, are terrible.  Avoid this DVD.  Film's okay.",1284336000,4,730,4.4772727272727275
8395475,3,B003EGWJB0,"The events of May 18, 1980 was a seminal moment in South Korean history.  For much of its modern history, South Korea had been in the grip of a military dictatorship, and the recent coup by General Chun Doo-hwan on 12 December 1979 following the assassination of President Park (as depicted in the excellent film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-President-s-Last-Bang/dp/B000E3LD5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The President's Last Bang</a>) led to general unease in the country, particularly amongst its youth.  The unrest exploded into demonstrations by students in Gwangju on May 17 when the government closed the University. This led to a civilian uprising, exacerbated by student fatalities when armed police fired on protesters.  Gwangju was cordoned off, and after 10 days, Chun sent in the Korean army to rout the protesters, who had by then formed an armed militia. After a 90 minute battle, the army restored government control of the city, in what is now called the Gwangju Massacre.  Although there were a number of civilian deaths (estimates range from 150 to 2000 deaths amongst the civilians), the events in Gwangju ultimately set in motion the shift in the Korean leadership from a military dictatorship to a fully fledged democracy.

""May 18"" is a fictionalised account of the civilian uprising in Gwangju.  The events are largely seen through the eyes of Min-woo, a taxi driver living in Gwangju with his younger brother Jin-woo.  Jin-woo (played by Lee Jun-ki of the ""The King and the Clown"") is a student . Veteran Korean actor Ahn Sung-ki (Nowhere to Hide, Arahan, Last Witness) plays the father of Min-woo's love interest, who ultimately takes leadership of the militia.  Although he does not desire any involvement, Min-woo becomes part of the militia as well.  After initially establishing the locale, the pace of the film moves relatively quickly into the protests, and subsequent battles with the military.

Technically, ""May 18"" has quite high production values.  The sequence as the protesters confront the police is re-enacted with some flair and intensity (apparently over 600 extras were employed), and the climatic battle is also nicely shot.  Although well put together, and generally well acted, the entire tone of the film is very melodramatic by western standards.  I am reasonably familiar with Korean cinema being somewhat a fan, and this tendency to melodrama is not unusual.  Even so, ""May 18"" struck me as being particularly overblown and excessive, possibly due to the importance of the subject matter to Koreans.  There are abundant cliches throughout ""May 18""; antagonists in civilian life become civilian heroes under siege.  There are the nominal cowards, the reluctant leaders, the evil military goons following the direction of the leadership, but of course with the token dissenter.  The limited characterisation leaves many of the actors very little to work with.  Ultimately, all of these cliches become quite tiresome and predictable, and in my opinion detract from the final film.

So overall not the greatest cinema to come out of Korea, but still worth a look to gain some understanding of the importance of 18 May to Koreans.

8395476,5,B003EGWJB0,"This is a great film to understand Korea's recent history as a foreigner, if you follow the perspective of an ordinary Korean.  I really like the taxi driver who used to mind his own business and later became a hero to protect his people's  rights.  This transformation was very well performed by Mr. Kim Sang-Kyung.

I am also deeply moved that Korean actresses and actors are willing to take part of this film and to speak out what they believe.  When actors, like Mr. Kim Sang-Kyung, could act so well, they wouldn't have to pretend to be politically neutral to please everyone.

I would also recommend another film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Formosa-Betrayed/dp/B0039ZBLZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Formosa Betrayed</a>"" portraying Taiwan people's struggles of democracy and human rights under the martial law during the 1980's, the same period of time as ""May 18"". This is a very entertaining film, starring James Van Der Beek as a FBI agent.  And he has really done great since I watched ""Dawson's Creek"" 10+ years ago.

These two films together would help people know more about Asian countries' road to democracy in the 1980's.",1282521600,2,1180,5.375
