I remember watching this show as a kid so was so excited when I found this for sale! I remembered Kingfish, Sapphire, Andy, Lightening and Calhoun. It felt like yesterday to be watching this again. I don't know why Bill Cosby supposedly bought these up. I don't see any difference with I Love Lucy making fun of women and this. After all on radio it was white men playing black men. At least on TV it was black men playing black men. And the first all black TV show. We loved it and am sure you will too. A wonderful trip down memory lane for those of us who watched it as kids and a fun romp for those who didn't. Enjoy!",1446940800,,789,4.096774193548387
