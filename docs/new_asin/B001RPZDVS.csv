San Francisco Opera has  given us and excellent rendition of this opera.",1293148800,9,186,4.636363636363637
3778138,5,B001RPZDVS,"I am a little impatient with truly Grand Opera because of its length and sometimes over the top complexity, but if you can manage the time, the rewards are great.  This production is rare (l'Africaine is not produced much anywhere) and rich both in production values and great singing.  Shirley Verrett manages her wonderful voice well although she is no longer young.  Ruth-Ann Swenson does a fine job with a bland part (maiden in distress), and Placido Domingo (old reliable) does his usual sterling job.  Only Justino Diaz disappoints.

The music is delicious much of the time. This is well worth your time and money.  Enjoy.",1259625600,19,628,4.877358490566038
3778139,5,B001RPZDVS,"Meyerbeer is an opera composer unfamiliar to many because his operas are so seldom produced, full of drama requiring large casts and super grand and romantic scenery and costumes, as well as great suspension of disbelief.  His LA GIOCONDA  is more familiar with a more believable plot, since L'AFRICAINE involves the exploration ala Vasco di Gama, including a wild storm at sea and piracy, as well as poisonous vegetation; but this is a gorgeous production with a great cast as well as the ravishing singing of both Placido Domingo and gorgeous Shirley Verrett with one of the most beautiful farewell deaths in opera.  Expect to be seduced both visually and aurally.",1258588800,19,666,4.981981981981982
3778140,3,B001RPZDVS,"The life of Vasco da Gama is sort of a mystery even in most history books.
This opera/ play plot is a complete fictionalization of that life
with little resemblance to the real life.
One thing that really spoiled the effect of the tale was the
music in India was just so far from being Indian.
People doing fake Indian dances in costume to Italian opera music was
just ridiculous.
The tree that kills was new to me: must be some myth
that I have never heard of.
The costumes,stage scenes, music and singing were all done very,very well.
I have to say that I liked the snake bladed swords
of the Indian soldiers and the Buddhist costumes on Hindu
priest both.",1253059200,6,658,4.401639344262295
3778141,5,B001RPZDVS,"Swenson sings with an effortless, light lyric sound, every note a jewel in this lovely production of this exotic opera.  Later she tried to push more drama into too light an instrument.  This video shows what should have been. Verrett and Diaz will tear at your heart strings with Meyerbeer's gorgeous bel canto music.  Diaz is a bit past prime vocally, but still marvelous.  A must for opera lovers, and enjoyable for anyone who likes fine music.",1246752000,18,447,4.766233766233766
8338586,5,B001RPZDVS,"I knew some of the music, but I had never seen the complete opera before, I read the plot before buying the DVD and I liked it. I also was familiar with the cast which was very good.
I am very glad that I purchased this DVD. The music is beautiful and the singers are outstanding.
Who ever watches this opera can fill sorry for the main character, Zelica, who loves gamma unconditionally, helping him along the way and committed suicide when she realized that this kind of relationship was impossible.
The scenery and costumes are very good as well as the orchestra.
Images and sound were great as well as the quality of the DVD even though it was an old recording without HD.
I highly recommend it.",1503792000,,699,4.426356589147287
8338587,5,B001RPZDVS,Thrilled to find this performance on cd....highly recommend it.,1498953600,,63,6.111111111111111
8338588,5,B001RPZDVS,"Verrett is fabulous.  Domingo is the best I have ever seen/heard him.  And when I think of all the great Domingo performances I have seen, that's saying a lot.  He looks as tho he is putting every ounce of strength he has into his singing.  It is a very masculine performance as befits the role of Vasco de Gama.  At the curtain call he looks exhausted.  At the end of this superb performance he has every right to be.

Interesting sets.  Gorgeous costumes in every color of the rainbow.  Verrett's last magnificent costume in green, blue, and purple must be seen to be believed.  A delightful ballet.  A wonderful telling of a grand story.  I do not understand why this opera is not better known.  This is a first rate performance by every single cast member of a first rate opera.  ~ Celeste Downey",1466208000,4,800,4.465277777777778
8338589,5,B001RPZDVS,"With an outstanding quartet of  Stars, this makes quite a night of opera (or, two nights,  if like me, you divide up the longer opera's to play over two or more nights).  Through the always strange machinations of Fate, as well as the hostility (and anti-semitism) of his era, led by a one time suppliant for his favor, Wagner, he declined from his seat at the top of the opera food chain in the mid-nineteenth century to become a non-person, so to speak, by the time the 20th century rolled around. That fact should not deter anyone from enjoying the great pleasure of his company in this recording. With Verrett, as the Slave Queen and Domingo, her Master, by dint of saving her from a watery grave (to coin a cliche), how can you go wrong, particularly when Swenson, the girl he loves (she returns his love), does such a beautiful job and the fourth of the quartet, the Queen's bodyguard, Diaz, is just as good. All sorts of strong currents are coursing beneath the surface of the basic love story, heroic adventure and test of Wills,  Race, Religion, Servitude and the like, but one can ignore them if not in the mood for disturbing the flow of the story by thinking about them.  Of course, the story is fiction, with some coloration from the use of a real character, but gripping nonetheless.
San Francisco Opera House does itself proud with voluptuous costumes and excellent sets...not to mention some nice dancing from the S.F.  Ballet....but it is the singing and the  story that carry the day...which is what some of his biographers say was his intention. (In the event you do not know, Jacob Liebmann Beer-the identity cloaked under his operatic pseudonym- lived from 1791 to 1864. He was born to a wealthy Jewish family living in Berlin and remained in the Faith for all of his life despite the numerous pressures in the social system of Europe to convert. He made good use of the wealth during his career in that he had the option of working as best suited him rather than being subject to the whims of  opera producers or craftsmen with whom he worked.
While not considered the best of what he produced, this should be part of any decent library of opera DVD's (if like me, you are still far behind the most modern tools available to collectors and still rely on discs). It is excellent entertainment and, not to forget, contains an aria by Domingo, which was a 'must have it' for every non-Wagnerian tenor worth his salt in the era of the 78 RPM disc in which I grew up, O Paradiso. ( I no longer have those 78's, far too heavy to tote around the country, but as I write I  am listening to U tube with Caruso's 1907 version of which I once owned a copy.)",1448755200,3,2668,4.484536082474227
8338590,5,B001RPZDVS,"Superb casting of a currently underperformed opera.
Sung in the original French, Meyerbeer's music style reminds us of the best Italian operas by Bellini and Donizetti.
The libretto makes free use of  historic names, but has plenty of intrigue, adventure, unrequitted love and passion.
Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",1424649600,,324,5.612244897959184

8338592,5,B001RPZDVS,"Great traditional production of a semi-forgotten masterpeice. Singing is fisrt rate,especially Verret and Swenson. The men are very good singers too but the ladies in the cast overshadow them a bit. Very good value. A must have for Grand-opera lovers....specially because there not much Meyerbeer out there...",1405296000,3,309,5.595744680851064
8338593,5,B001RPZDVS,"Normally, Im not a big fan of French-language opera or of Meyerbeer. This is an exception. The quality of the singing is perfect. The video is dated and, consequently, we have to accept the video technology of that decade. Shirley Verrett, as Slika, Placido Domingo, as Vasco da Gama and Ruth Ann Swenson, as Ins, perform superbly. A definite keeper.",1398038400,3,350,4.85
8338594,5,B001RPZDVS,"This is a rare opportunity to see and hear an excellent cast perform an opera that most of us have never seen live.  This semester I am devoting my opera course to French opera and this is the third opera we will view (I am a university music professor).  Diaz is in spectacular voice: full, round, and dramatic.  Verrett sings beautifully.  Domingo and Swenson complete the stars in the cast.  Since Meyerbeer was a major opera composer in France in the nineteenth century, I consider this DVD to be a major and much-valued contribution to the repertory of opera on film.",1380153600,6,572,4.623762376237623
8338595,5,B001RPZDVS,"The opera ""L`Africaine"" (1865) by Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791-1865)is one of the most exuberant masterworks that I have listened. PLACIDO DOMINGO in the role of Vasco de Gama displays a very awesome heroic performance. His aria ""O paradis"" is sung sweetly. SHIRLEY VERRETT in the principal role sings with an incredible energy and force her arias. L`Africaine is a story about the sacrifice for a no corresponded love. The intimacy of the characters of this opera makes it a real treasure. The conductor Maurizio Arena made a good job in this performance. It`s a great displaying of emotions. I highly recommend this performance.",1311120000,13,625,5.137254901960785
