8637225,3,B00HXM8W3K,"I'd give it three stars for the purple dress alone. If you're going to blow the bad guys away, do it in a bright purple dress with a big old west hammer-gun. The sound was realistic, just needed larger clouds of smoke. I liked the surrealism, black humor and nod to science or pseudo-science of the day. Great second half when the revenge kicked into 'FULL KILL' mode. A sexy female killing bad men, dumb men, always a win . . throw in an expendable female, a couple comic kills, even better, depending on your taste. Favorite scene: Let's go take advantage of the naked woman standing half submersed in the river: Is she bathing, is she praying, as she is swaying, to good old gospel music? . . . Uh Oh! . . . Tuck and run boys, tuck and run! This scene and others had the feel of Tarantino or the Cohen Brothers. Hey, this movie was also made by a couple brothers! They played the dead guys, cool. Adult bits include the religious leader gets to have sex with all the women, the male followers get promises of future companionship - plus some well-deserved humiliation (for being in such a ridiculous cult). Gratuitious skin, why not? Fun. Good adult leaning entertainment.  Blu ray was good quality with extras.",1420329600,,1214,4.493212669683258
