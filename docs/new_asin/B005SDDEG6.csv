8484756,5,B005SDDEG6,"My 14 year old son has a new found interest in hand drumming...and by that, I mean that he was driving me completely insane drumming on anything and everything around the house. lol. SO...I looked into lessons for him. It is not as easy as one might think to find lessons specifically for hand drumming....and costly. I found this video through the advice of a friend and it has been great! The video is well done with individual lessons that he can follow along with and b/c it was so cost friendly vs lessons...this is his starting point. I've got to say that it is starting to become more enjoyable to hear him play and others have started to compliment him!",1488067200,,661,4.471074380165289
