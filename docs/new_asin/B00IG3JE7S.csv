8641903,5,B00IG3JE7S,"A ""Must Have"" for Perfume fans.  Live of their LEVEL 3 tour.  Good audio.  Their venue is kind of big now, so I enjoy their WORLD TOUR recordings better, as they play smaller venues.
I must admit Perfume Talk is kind of getting OLD, but if you haven't seen a full concert on disc or LIVE, is a huge part of their concert, but you can skip through those easily enough. (But A-Chan is really really funny).
Perfume is starting to get a bit ""Over Produced""... would fit right in in Las Vegas.
I prefer their EBISU, and Shibuya Ax concerts.",1483401600,,536,4.287128712871287
