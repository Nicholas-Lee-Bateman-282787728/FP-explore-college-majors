8566493,5,B00BCXVZHQ,"I thought I knew about Whitney Young. I was wrong. I believe, watching this documentary that Young was a visionary, and his vision wasn't just appropriate back then, but is so now.",1387670400,,180,4.65625
8566494,5,B00BCXVZHQ,"I strongly recommend this film because of its keen insight and thorough appreciation of an invaluable trailblazer in multi-national corporate diversity and inclusion. Having worked as a civil rights lawyer for the National Office of the NAACP, during the seventies, I had the privilege of working with the professional members of the National Office of the National Urban League. Having worked with both Rockefeller black Republicans as well as Nixon black Democrats, I can fully understand much of what it took to bring Ken Chenault to become CEO of American Express, as well as what it took to bring Ursula Burns to become CEO of Xerox. Whether or not the world will ever see these two achievements on American soil as being on par with the ""belonging"" that the great Josephine Baker achieved in her adopted land of France will always be  debatable.",1372723200,,851,4.951048951048951
