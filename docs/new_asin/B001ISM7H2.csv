I even called A & E and was told that it was completely out of print which means that the conversion to DVD won't be forthcoming.  That's unfortunate because there are many Deborah Kerr fans out there who are desperate to find this who no longer have VCRs.  Thank goodness I still have two in working order.

This is a lovely biography of not only a fantastic actress, but a lovely person as well.  If I'm not mistaken, this was filmed in 1999 which was after Ms. Kerr had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and wasn't doing public appearances anymore.  They did, however, find some lovely gems from interviews she did in the mid 80s that were inserted in this show.  There were also interviews with her daughter, Francesca, the lovely Jean Simmons, her assistant and biographer.

This tells a tale of a shy little girl in Scotland who had family trouble and was sent to a boarding school where she was bullied.  As a young teen, her actress aunt had an acting school that she attended and truly a star was born.  If you watch any of her films, you always get a glimpse of her humanity in all of the characters she played.  As a woman, she just wanted to be happy and be a nice person which I think that she achieved.  She was one of the few stars at the time who was able to keep her reputation in tact even when things weren't going so well in her life with a divorce and having her children taken away for a while.

In 1969, she made a decision to stop making movies.  That was pretty amazing seeing that she was only in her 40s, still quite lovely and on top of her game.  She wasn't happy with where the movie industry was going and even more unhappy with the roles she was being offered so she decided to do more stage work.  She did, however, did come back to do a couple of television roles and ""The Assam Garden"" which was a quiet little film in which she played a character so unlike ones she'd done in the past.

All in all, for Deborah Kerr fan with a collection of her work, this is a must have.",1360022400,,2167,4.233576642335766
