7739180,5,B01ENSOKK0,"If you don't want angst in your cop show, this isn't for you.

If you don't want to join in the parade of emotions, don't start watching this series.

If you want the only crimes committed to be those perpetrated by criminals, don't bother with this.

If you don't want dark, brilliant, hyper-real storytelling, you'll probably want to go elsewhere.

When you're in the mood for all of this and more, step right up because this 100% binge-worthy production is all for you.
The writing, acting, atmosphere, surprises, musical score, everything is high quality.

You will want to watch the seasons in order. Most of the storylines carry over from one episode to another. I don't think any of them qualify as stand-alone.

Based on the fact that this season had its original airing in summer 2016, looks like we'll be waiting awhile for season four, which has been ordered.

I'm ready. #holycliffhangerbatman",1480204800,4,905,4.875816993464053

7739182,5,B01ENSOKK0,This show is excellent. I really love the cast and especially the two sexy leads (my oh my). I enjoy watching a police show centered in a country other than America. The different perspective is great.,1478304000,,202,4.638888888888889
7739183,1,B01ENSOKK0,"How you respond to this series will depend on what you want in a cop show. I like cop shows that focus on the crime and how it's solved. I love the series Suspects because that's what that series does,and because it moves right along. Sure, there's some character development, and over the course of the series you get to know the characters and care about them. But this show, 19-2, seems like soap opera to me, and I hated it. Too little focus on the crimes and the thought processes involved in solving those crimes, and way too much info and long, drawn-out angst about the personal lives of the cops. If I want to watch a soap opera, I'll watch one. When I turn to a police procedural, I want the emphasis to be on crime solving. I want a ""whodunnit."" I realize a lot of people like the soap opera aspect, however, and for them this must be heaven. To each her own.",1477526400,3,870,4.246987951807229

7739186,5,B01ENSOKK0,"19-2 series 2. This award-winning character-driven crime drama comes from the land that Americans are pleased to consider the frozen North, Canada, to be precise.  The gritty, hard-hitting television series is set in the handsome island city  and how I love island cities: French-speaking Montreal, and is, in fact, an English language translation of a popular French language production.  As the winner of the 2016 Canadian Screen Award for Best Dramatic Series, it is a  compelling drama that explores the demons that haunt the men and women behind the badge.  It has also won  Best Actor for Jared Keeso, who plays one of the partners central to the story: partners who must learn to trust each other.  It was nominated for numerous other awards, including Best Direction, Best Writing, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. In its focus on the life of cops on the street it can be compared to some of the best American productions: HILL STREET BLUES, HOMICIDE, THE WIRE, LAW AND ORDER.

Series two, which gives us more of the on- and off- the job drama  faced by these  beat cops, foot soldiers in the war on crime, jumps straight in at the deep end with an explosive season opener that, in my experience, is  extraordinary for TV. Centered on a school shooter, a 35 minute intensely heart-thumping  action take.  When the quiet shift of our stars, Officers Ben Chartier (Keeso) and Nick Barron (Adrian Holmes) takes a dramatic turn as they are first responders to what proves to be the worst call of their careers. With the entire squad eventually involved, the fallout from the tragic events of the day has a dolorous impact as the squad struggles to come to terms with what has happened.  Mind you, this  second series is powered by the forces  higher-ups belief that Station 19 has been infiltrated by a mole who, they think, is linked to the death of at least three officers. They require Officer Chartier  to  investigate his fellow cops, with a focus on his own partner, Nick Barron.  The race to find the mole  gets desperate: Officer Chartier gets in too deep.

I received this box set for purposes of writing a fair and honest review.  The set consists of  three discs containing ten episodes  running approximately 444 minutes, and numerous special features that include:
  A behind-the-scenes look at the first episode of season 2, when station 19 is the first to respond to a school shooting (3 min).
  The Women of 19-2  Interviews with the cast and crew reveal an inside look to the female characters of 19-2. (4 min.)
  Showdown  A behind-the-scenes look at the confrontation between Ben and Nick. (4 min.)
  The Dark Side  A series of interviews with the cast and crew to discuss the dark sides to the characters of 19-2. (4 min.)
  The Mole  A discussion about the mole in station 19 and the repercussions when the officers find out who has betrayed them.(4 min.)
There are also subtitles, thank goodness, for those whod have trouble with the French-inflected dialog.  And, beware, for the sensitive or family viewers, coarse language, graphic violence, sexual content, nudity and disturbing images.  For the rest of us, we are privileged to watch as the cop shop responds to some of the citys most violent, bizarre crimes, learns the high cost of life on the force, on and off duty. This award-winning production is absorbing, authentic, powerful, with an outstanding ensemble cast. We see the first responders whose duty it is to protect the public beyond the crime scenes at work, follow them home into their own messy lives. It is well-written, well-paced and acted. And for les girls, Adrian Holmes, for onscreen charisma and presence, could give Idris Elba a run for his money. And hes closer to home!",1472256000,,3742,4.813186813186813
7739187,5,B01ENSOKK0,"First off, I would think that those coming to this review of the Second Season of this procedural police /mystery series (produced in Canada ) have already seen Season 1 (If not, I apologize, but highly recommend that you start with Series One so you can watch the characters develop. And  no spoiler here  know the underlying story of internal corruption in the police squad which was NOT resolved in season one) So I won't repeat info from the first season. And this is a mystery series  and those who have read my other Amazon reviews know that I detest spoilers  or reviews that give away too much of the plot  so I will provide very little plot info here. The fun of a mystery is not knowing what will happen.

There are 10 episodes of approx. 45 minutes (this was on commercial TV and so the commercials have (thankfully) been renewed.

There is graphic violence and strong language. I doubt that the series will be on PBS here. There would need to be a lot of editing for the violent images.
One thing that impressed me was the first episode this time. There is one scene that runs as long as 25 minutes  unheard of on TV.
Again, if youve seen the earlier series (if not, return to my first sentence above), you know that this is about the Internal Investigations Unit of ta police department. And  again no spoiler here  there are some rotten apples in on the force and they have to be fleshed out. Who is good and who isn't is the crux of the story and I will NOT tell you any more about it.

Im looking at the review already posted and Im seeing way too much being revealed that is not necessary and gives away too much. (Why do reviewers who have seen mysteries give so much info and spoil the fun for others?. )I even urge you to get the DVD (its great show) but, when you choose an episode.  DO NOT read the text that shows up next. It is not a recap; it is a summary of what you will see next and DOES contain spoilers. Dont worry if you watch episodes separately. Each episode starts with a recap of what you have already seen (this plays during the opening credits).

There are three bonus features on the DVD. Running about 13 minutes  And I also recommend that you not to watch any of the bonuses before watching all the episodes. Too much is revealed in the featurette.

The DVD is not being released until August 30, 2016 but I was provided with an advance copy in exchange for an honest, and objective, review

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7739188,5,B01ENSOKK0,"Every character has a dark secret. A modern Montreal precinct personal-lives drama amid a cop investigation series. Cops in & out of uniform- and beds. As much Lets roll in beds as squad cars. Viewers get a look as though they are in the room, or back seat. Primary characters are Patrolmen Nick Barron and Ben Chartier (pronounced Shaw-tay). Downtowns 19th district + these partners in patrol car #2 = 19-2. Youll get to know their comrades, men and women, personal relations, men to women; and Station 19s w to m & w to w. There are crimes, school shootings, blood, murder, fights, and action. Focus is on the lowest rung of the crime fighters and their complicated daily life dramas. Nicks ex, Det Isabelle, played by Maxim Roy, works at 19 too and I love seeing her in quite a different role than what I know her from Heartland, another must own Canadian series)
Not all ends well. Not pretty. Tragic end. But you cant stop watching. Brutally compelling.
Yes, there is to be Season 3.
Season 2 begins where Season 1 ended. I strongly recommend both, in order.

7739198,5,B01ENSOKK0,"A new police procedural series, 19-2, is a Canadian show that has hit its prime. This series streamed from Acorn, is more about the characters than some of the crime. However, I found it exceptionally good. Give yourself two to three episodes to allow yourself a feel for what is going on. I would also advise that you view Season 1 before going on to Season 2. All of the background of Season 1 is needed to fully understand the characters and their squad.

Taking place in Montreal, 19-2, refers to the precinct and squad car number. The two major characters are Nick Barron, played by Adrian Holmes. He has returned from leave after an incident where his partner was shot in the head and qincapacitated.  His fellow policemen are wary around him, Nick is quick to anger and no one wants to partner with him. However, a newcomer, Ben Chartier, played by Jared Leeso, comes to the unit from a suburb in Quebec. They start out with great reluctance, and we have a chance to get to know both of them.

We also pick up on the rest of the team. Lots of romance, drinking and off times are shown. The crimes are the same as any city. Many of them surround the various gangs, but they also assist with domestic disputes. This series centers on a regular patrol unit, it's team and superiors. In Season 2, there are issues with the internal squad. One squad member is asked to work with Internal Investigation and provide information. At the same time there is another internal investigation with the squad. Morale is low, squad members have been injured, and now, we find if the squad can rise above all of these issues.

The writing is superb, the storylines gripping and present the lives of the various police members. This is not a flashy unit, but a picture of law enforcement day to day. It does help that most of the characters are good looking.

8759258,3,B01ENSOKK0,"Decent show, but not great.

- Nick Barron is one of TV's most infuriating poorly-written characters. He's an irrational raging jerk. He's a liability to every other cop on the show, to his witnesses, to his family. He has sex with most every woman on the show. And through all that he's painted as a good guy.

- All of the lengthy softcore porn scenes are bizarrely shoehorned in. Episodes where that is prevalent -- almost every episode -- end up feeling like tedious late-night Cinemax or Showtime fare.",1536364800,,507,4.685393258426966

8759263,5,B01ENSOKK0,"Fantastic Show - written with brains! I bought Acorn TV so I could have the series. Ended up binge watching. The characters were developed so well as officers and private citizens. Be prepared for a VERY emotional, compelling, loving (yes sexual), and at times violent show. I loved how the characters were also delicate, sensitive, and true to officers. My only complaint would be the unnecessary knockdown fights between the police and firefighters. I was disappointed to have the writers have them not be able to work together, they work together well; unnecessary drama. Other than that misstep, it is TV, after all, this is a fantastic show and left us with a huge cliff hanger. I can't wait for more seasons!
