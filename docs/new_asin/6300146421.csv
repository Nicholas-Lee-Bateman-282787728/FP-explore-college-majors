208667,5,6300146421,"""Humongous"" may have had a cheesy name, but really, it was a good movie. Five kids on a yacht are cruisin' around when they pick up some guy stranded on his little boat. Then they crash on this island. It's a good storyline there, and could be scary, but the thing that really brought this film down was--as everyone knows--the lighting.

Humongous was made in 1981, released in 82, due to the switching of studios. It's the coming of those early 80's horror films, that usually deal with slashers. But humongous is a little different, not better, but different. It starts out in 1946, labor day weekend on an island of a rich man and his daughter, and a pack of dogs. Well, the daughter is raped by a drunk suitor and then is devoured by the dogs. Picks up in 1982, where a bunch of friends are spending a vacation. To make a long story short, the friends crash their boat on the island, where they are stalked by a humongous monster. (the son of the raped woman).  It has some scares and cool camera angles, and neat music but the real trouble here is, it's too dark. I mean you can't see anything. We get a quick glance at the monster in the end.  From the director of Prom Night (1980), a little something different.  It was on cable HBO when most of us were kids. Cool poster too.",1211155200,,1285,4.319502074688796

In 1948 a teenage girl is raped by her boyfriend, and in revenge is killed for the act. Years later after she gave birth to his bastard retarded son, she secludes herself on a desolate island to raise him. After she died he is left to defend for himself, not knowing how to take care of himself he preys on the islands animals and his own guard dogs for food. Late one Summer evening, a group of teens out for a summer boating ride breaks down aside the island, looking for help they stumble onto his territory, and just in time-- he is hungry and hunts the teens like they were wild animals for food.

[good things]

First off, the movie's first kill was the bloodiest, a dog attack and pretty well done, in my opinion. I liked the setting. Of course, it being an 80's slasher flick it took a lot from movies like Friday The 13th. The movie was set in the middle of nowhere, it had a potentially menacing villain, beautiful heroine to be, a nice backstory, and a nice body count. I also liked the stalking nature of the killer, very similar to the P.O.V. shots in Friday The 13th. The movie was set over the course of a few days, and seemed to have nods to movies like Friday The 13th, Psycho and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie's killer was Garry Robbins, who played Saw Tooth on Wrong Turn.

[the bad]

The movie was old, and I had a DVDr sourced from VHS. The movie was too dark at times to see anything. The killer went unseen because of this, the lighting in the movie also sucked. Directing was lack lustre' and the movie in general was very anti-climatic. So much could have been done with the ending, and it completely fell limp. The movie I saw lacked blood, the kills seemed to be cut out all together. The teens would see the killer, and it would cut to another scene and later on they would be found mutilated. That was one of my biggest complaints with the movie.

[final thoughts]

In certain areas the movie was tense, it had a couple good scares, but all in all the movie was flat. The killer could have been so much meaner, and there could have been more blood. Some of the kills were pretty brutal, but let's thank the MPAA for the cuts. The movie seemed to have a lot taken from Friday The 13th Part 2. first off the concept for the killer; no father, retarded/deformed, killing people in mourning of his dead mother. Second, the killer had his dead mother displayed in his home for a memorial and third, in one scene one of the girls stumbles onto the memorial and acts like his mother to try and get away from him. There were a lot of other similarities, but these were the ones that seemed almost blatant to me.

Finally, this movie is a good addition to any slasher collection, the movie stands neck to neck with slasher movies like Madman and The Final Terror, but lacks blood and it lacks the scares that movies like Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Burning gave us.",1136246400,11,2939,4.350364963503649
208670,3,6300146421,"Not all horror movies are classics, let's get that straight. But for those of you who appreciate monstrous killers, moody settings, and Janet Julian, Humongous is the flick for you. Yes it is typical of the genre. Idiot kids destroy thier boat, wash ashore on what they believe to be a deserted island, and run afoul of death. What seperates this movie from others of its ilk is the mood created by this film. Dark, well scored, and of decent acting, Humongous may be considered a hidden gem.",1127606400,34,492,4.6022727272727275
208671,3,6300146421,"Humongous is a likeable enough movie even with its flaws. For one; the actor playing Humongous is not that humongous, although this is not particularly noticeable except for one fight scene where the two guys fighting are not all that different in size, and one of them is supposed to be humongous. Let's not even talk about the obvious influence of 'Psycho' in this movie. Or even a scene right out of 'Friday the 13th, Part II'. I still found this to be an enjoyable romp when I saw it in the theatre when it was released. I wish I could say the same for the VHS tape, however, the transfer is horrible. Nighttime scenes are so dark that at times the screen is just black with only audio. Unfortunately, a lot of this movie takes place at night, making the tape unwatchable. It was not this way in the theatre. Some may like this movie; some may not; nobody will like this tape. Of note to those who care: the cute redhead sister in this movie is Janit Baldwin ('Ruby', 'Gator Bait').-Bob",1096588800,6,990,4.415300546448087
208672,3,6300146421,"Compared to the last horrible movie I reviewed (The Dead hate the living) this was like drinking water from the Holy Grail after walking 666 days in the desert. Of course compared to good horror movies from this time period, it stands in much of the same low budget movie fare like Frogs and Pirahna. I wouldn't recommend actually paying money for it, but it's definitely worth checking out on a rainy night when nothing else is on.
The story: At a family party on some privately owned island, a young lady loves her dogs and her dogs love her. A drunken guest loves the way the lady looks loving her dogs so he tries to love her. Upset with his drunken gestures, the young lady slaps the drunken guest lovingly across the face. Angered by her slap, the drunken guest lovingly begins raping her. The loved dogs lovingly become upset with the drunken guest and rip through their fence and lovingly start mauling the loving drunken guest. The young girl lovingly tells her dogs to stop and then she lovingly smashes the loving drunken guest in the head with a brick of love, killing him. She gives birth to his love child. 30 years later two teenage couples crash their boat on this island and quickly become monster fodder. You might notice the monster will remind you a lot of the monster from Funhouse, another cheesy 80's flick. However you never actually get to see the monster clearly or anything for that matter because of the low light use. A lot of the time you'll be staring at a black screen with silly grunting and leaves shuffeling sound effects.
Bad acting, weak plot, and slight nudity, it's the stuff you expect from such movies and it delivers. Watch it if you are bored and want to strain your eyes looking at a black screen.",1058313600,,1741,4.53015873015873
208673,2,6300146421,"This made the rounds on HBO and Cinemax and then disappeared into obscurity.
Two couples crash on an apparently deserted island.  I say apparently because they are definitely not alone.
With the threat of death from exposure, they venture inward and discover an H.P. Lovecraft reject living in isolation.  He is not happy.  Slasher movie stuff follows until the denouement, which is ripped right out of Friday the 13th Part 2.
The acting is pretty stiff.  Special effects are non-existent except for the killer/thing.  Dialogue is awful.  I kinda liked it.  It takes me back to the awful early eighties horror that was churned out every couple of months.  Janet Julian looks pretty Janet-licious here.  There is nothing actively offensive to my brain.  That's better than most horror films right there.
As with most of the horror films from this time that you've never heard of, there is a reason that you've never heard of them.  Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm St. were better movies and they've survived the test of time.  Humongous didn't and slipped into the cheap bin at the grocery store.

(I'm not exaggerating, either.)  Definitely a by-the-books slasher film in all other regards, but without the early-80's blood and gore.

208690,5,6300146421,"Humongous is no major classic, it's not a masterpiece, and it isn't the most original film ever made. However it does have a few good things going for it. It's kind of like an Anthropophagous (1980), Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), hybrid. We'll begin with the plot...

Some friends are out on a boat & find a man stranded, they bring him aboard. He tells them, that nearby is an island, inhabited by an old recluse woman, and her dogs. One of our characters (Nick) goes nuts, threatens his fellow friends/family members (and saved man) with a gun; and sails the boat right over some jagged rocks. They come ashore on the island, and find a horrifying secret. They all begin to fall prey to HUMONGOUS!

Good: The film has great atmosphere and foreboding mood. The acting ranges from bad to okay. The effects aren't stellar, but are passable. One minor nitpick I have, for a hulking cannibal, our antagonist sure doesn't seem to have much of an appetite, as we never see him eat anybody. That aside everything else is fine. I like the dark tones of the sky, which adds to the atmosphere. As we see the day in the beginning go from bright & sunny, to dark and haunting.

Humongous is a fun flick, that should be waded into with low expectations. It's enjoyable in it's own right.

Fun Facts: Humongous is manufactured from the creators of Prom Night (1980).

208714,4,6300146421,"I bought this DVD for purely sentimental reasons.  I first saw this movie back when I was working towards a degree in photography.  What impressed me most were the carefully composed scenes, especially once the characters got to the lodge on Dog Island.  I hadn't seen many slasher-type horror movies up to that time so I had nothing to compare this movie to; as a standard horror movie, it was okay.  As plots go, this is the usual clich of stranding teens in a place where they are picked off one at a time (most of the slaughter is done off screen).  In this film, you have to count yourself lucky that you even get to see the results.  Most things are hinted at, teased through shadow and light, movement, sound.  In that regard, most of the heavy lifting is done by the music score, which is very effect, all things considered.  Yes, most of the action takes place at night.  The `villain' is never seen in his entirety.  The cast consists of two brothers, one a gun toting nut, the other a jock, a bespectacled nerd-girl for comic relief, a bad girl, and a model.  They add another body, I mean stranger, to their small number later in the movie.  Except for the opening salvo, a harrowing rape sequence, most of the action comes much later in the game.
I like this movie not because it is especially well done, but because it struck a chord in me of unrelenting sadness, right up to the final image.

To this day, I still don't get the title: Humongous.  Who would name their kid that?  As for being descriptive of anything in this movie, I can't say they focused on anything long enough to get its dimensions.

I'm keeping it as being representative of a bygone era.  That, and because I am a sucker for this type of movie.",1341187200,,1731,4.3930817610062896

When they get there they are picked off one by one by something unknown (still don't know what that thing is). The most important thing to know about this dvd is that the night scenes somewhat clearer than the VHS or bootlegs of this movie. While still not exactly clear the viewer can make out the night scenes better on dvd. I really like this movie and love anyone who loves it or will at least give it a fighting chance.

208726,3,6300146421,"There is no denying that the 80's were the defining times for horror movies, even the bad and mediocre movies were fun to watch.  ""Humongous"" falls in the good category.  It's not very scary and it gets a little slow in the middle, but it remains entertaining throughout.  A group of teens find themselves stranded on an island with no sign of help in sight.  While trying to find shelter for an injured friend, the teens explore the island and end up finding an abandoned house, a house that that hides many secrets.  Soon, the group realizes there is something else on the island with them...something that's angry and hungry! Scorpion Releasing has done a great job with the uncut version of ""Humongous"".

208729,5,6300146421,"A woman is raped in 1946 by an ex-boyfriend; the guy is then mauled to death by her pet guard dogs.  It then cuts to the 80s where a group of people go on a boat trip with a lunatic called Nick who seems to hate his brother.  They stop the boat at night, and he gets annoyed by the sounds of howling dogs at a nearby island.  He overtakes the boat and says stuff like ""you're not the only one who can do things"" and ""I've got as much right as you.""  He crashes the boat and they wash ashore on the island with the dogs.  The baby of the rapist is now a deformed super strong freak that's still on the island.

 Some people will love this film and others won't.  It depends on your taste, but I've seen it numerous times.  It also doesn't get into the background of what's going on with this Nick character.  If you're a huge fan of 80s horror you'll probably like it because the entire thing has an 80s type feel to it. The director (Paul Lynch) was the director of the original PROM NIGHT. Like that film, there isn't a lot of gore here. The goriest scene is the scene in the beginning when the guy is mauled by the dogs; this scene and the rape scene are the only parts that were cut for the R rating. The rest of the film has very little gore, but some of the violence does have some impact. The killer (a deformed freak with superhuman strength) doesn't use weapons like in other 80s slasher films; he uses his brute strength to kill. He was wandering the island and eating dogs for food, but now his food supply is almost gone. Apparently, he is now eating people. This film has good atmosphere, and the island location provides nice scenery. It's well directed with a good amount of suspense, but you don't really care about the characters; you can tell that the film was trying to concentrate at times on character development, but I thought it definitely fails. There's some topless nudity, as well as a little full frontal during the rape scene in the beginning. Most of this movie is also very well scored. I thought the music during the opening and closing credits was pretty lousy and out of place for this type of film, but some of the other soundtracks are very well done and fit the film perfectly. Of particular mention is a scene towards the end when the freak is chasing a woman through the forest; the soundtrack was well done. The movie is slow at times and might bore some people, but I thought it is a great film that gets better with repeated viewings.

The DVD is mastered from a VHS master. There is grain, but it's sharp with decent color and contrast. It doesn't look fantastic, but this is the best quality that I've seen it in. Considering they used a VHS master, it looks better than what many would expect. Overall, I thought the transfer was good. They might have used a full screen master and converted it to widescreen with anamorphic enhancement, so it may not be a real widescreen film; but the quality is still good, and I'm glad it's on DVD.",1323129600,7,2979,4.311270125223613

Its really about a woman who was raped by her boyfriend and back in the 40s that was a disgrace most women couldn't just live with... so... she moves to an island with just dogs... and her son whom she keeps but somehow the kid isn't right in his head or apperance... so she more or less keeps him in the basement I gathered where he lives like a dog... until her death.

208731,4,6300146421,"The film ""Humongous"" has one strong point throughout the film, and that's its foreboding sense of doom for the characters involved.  The monster is hidden throughout most of the movie, but you get a good look at him in the end.  Okay, yes, the film is boring at stretches, the production values aren't great, but there's something about this film that's very distinct.  Like I said, it's the atmosphere.  The uncut version has a few slight extra bloody scenes, but nobody gets killed in ways that would make Tom Savini sweat his career.  Overall, the movie is average with an extra edge of ""they don't make them like they used to"" working for it.  I'm overjoyed to have this in my collection and will watch it again.

Warning: the rape scene at the beginning is very explicit.  You've been warned.",1322697600,23,797,4.642857142857143

208734,1,6300146421,"Humongous (Paul Lynch, 1982)

Prom Night director Lynch is back with a made-in-Canada cheapie about a bunch of kids who get stranded on an almost-deserted island inhabited only by a reclusive old lady. While it's miles better than Prom Night and does have a plethora of even lovelier ladies than that movie did (too bad so few of them could actually act; I'd sit and watch Janit Baldwin all day if she had even the barest smidgen of talent, because she's just plain hot in this flick), it's still silly and predictable, cleaving to all the conventions of the slasher genre without throwing in a single original bit. I spent over twenty-five years waiting to get my hands on a copy of this flick, and what a letdown it ended up being. *",1251331200,3,735,4.526315789473684

7802972,1,6300146421,"I am a fanatic for 80's horror but this flick was a HUGE let down ALL THE WAY AROUND. You never truly see this supposedly 7ft cannibalistic giant baby. Low death count, tame blood & gore and just BORING!! Don't expect anything but disappointment from this 80's tame thriller. Not worth the HIGH END cost of 80's collectability.",1479945600,,327,4.655172413793103
7802973,3,6300146421,"This movie was merely OKAY! I've seen ALOT worse, but I've also seen ALOT better also!
The plot is fine and the location adds a great atmosphere...but it doesn't save this film from simply being mediocre!
The lighting in some parts is very dark...even on the DVD. I recommend viewing it in the dark when you watch it....because
it helps the images to be clearer for the viewer!
When the monster is finally revealed, it's nothing special. The acting is okay for this type of movie.
Honestly though, I thought that this movie was going to be exceptional. I REALLY wanted it to be!
There was A LOT of untapped potential with this story and this location, but this movie is merely OKAY!",1466985600,,682,4.5528455284552845

7802975,3,6300146421,This is nostalgic for me. My brother and I loved horror flicks as children and this flick was memorable. We grew up boating Lake Erie and visiting the islands in the shallow western basin. So couple that with our fondness for Jason and Michael this flick was right up our alley. I've been looking for this on disc for years. The DVD does not have great video or audio quality but it's serviceable. The story is better than most slasher flicks but don't expect it to be superb. Most horror movies are junk. This one is decent.,1456185600,2,525,4.422680412371134
