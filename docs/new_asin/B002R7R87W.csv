3971475,4,B002R7R87W,"I have just recently started getting into barre workouts.  I have found that I tend to enjoy these workouts the most when they move along at a fairly good pace--some examples include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtend-Barre-Lean-Chiseled/dp/B004BBDHFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled</a>.  So, I became interested in the Cardio Barre series, which I read was also very fast-paced; in fact, some people complain that Cardio Barre moves TOO quickly.  However, after doing further research and watching clips of CARDIO BARRE ULTIMATE ADVANCED, I thought that it might meet my needs.

This workout is led by Richard Giorla, who leads a group of seven all-female background exercisers in an open studio set (the same set is also used for many CIA workouts).  Giorla, who describes this workout as ""extremely advanced"" in his Introduction, alternates between performing the exercises himself and walking around the room, calling out the women by name and offering encouragements; his cuing is mirrored for left/right.  The music is loud and upbeat--it has somewhat of a frenetic quality, but then again, so does the workout itself (the DVD case lists the main workout and both bonuses as being 172 bpm).

The Main Menu to the DVD reads as follows:
*Introduction to Workout
*Warm-Up to Workout
*Bonus Upper Body
*Bonus Lower Body
*Contact and Credits

If you select the Warm-Up, it flows right into the main workout, which is about 55 minutes long total and has nine chaptered segments.  I have listed approximate times and descriptions for each of these segments below.

WARM-UP, 5.5 minutes
Giorla begins by introducing his background exercisers.  He then combines dynamic moves using the barre, such as squats, with static stretches--unfortunately, however, I felt that he introduced the static stretching before the body was properly warmed up.  The warm-up concludes with rear leg lifts bent over the barre (Giorla incorporates leg work into EVERY segment).

PLIES, 5 minutes
For this segment, you are facing with your side to the chair; this does make it a little difficult to follow, especially since Giorla moves so quickly.  He starts on the one side with wide-legged plies, both flat-footed and on the toes; on the other side, he performs a first-position plie.

BALLET, 3.5 minutes
This segment starts with tendu, sliding each leg out to the side rapidly, then alternating legs.  Next comes grand battement both to the front and to the side.

WAIST, 4.5 minutes
For this segment, you are mainly performing rapid torso twists.  Giorla intensifies the work by adding arm pushes, pulls, and knee lifts.  The segment concludes with small squats and push-ups.

CARDIO, 8 minutes
This segment involves rapidly moving one leg/one arm at the same time.  Giorla starts in a bent-over position, pulling in the knee and the arm, the comes to standing for knee/arm pulls both side and front.  The next move is a tap side with a reach, and then the final move is leg lifts.  After doing one side (about 4 minutes), everything is repeated on the other side.

BARRE THIGHS, 5 minutes
The moves in this segment are performed bending over the chair.  Giorla leads the group in rear leg lifts with the leg out on a diagonal; unlike with some of the other exercises, the moves here are first performed slow, then fast.  Giorla does a standing Figure 4 stretch prior to moving on to the other side.

UPPER BODY, 6 minutes
For this segment, the class appears to be using 1-lb. weights, although Giorla says you can use 1-3 lbs.  The majority of the segment focuses exclusively on the shoulders, a Giorla cues shoulder raises to the front, side, and back, first slow, then smaller, fast pulses.  The section ends with a brief (1 minute) sequence of tricep dips on the floor.

ABS, 12.5 minutes
I was pleasantly surprised to discover that a good part of this segment is NOT abs work!  The section does start with abs, including side plank (performing hip raises from this position), hip lifts (a.k.a. reverse curls), and a brief sequence of crunches/bicycles.  Pelvic tilts serve as a sort of transition, and then the remainder of this segment consists of floorwork for the legs.  Giorla starts with side-lying leg lifts, performing these in three different positions to completely target the entire outer thighs/hips.  The segment concludes lying on the back for some pulsing inner thigh work.

COOL-DOWN, 4.5 minutes
To begin the stretch, Giorla begins on the back, rolling the legs over the head (a.k.a. yoga plow pose), an advanced move that seems rather unnecessary here.  He then performs a lying hamstring stretch, lying twist, seated wide-legged forward bend (to both the sides and front), and standing forward bend, finishing standing.

This DVD also includes Bonus workouts for both the Upper Body and the Lower Body.  These add-ons, which clock in at 14 minutes each, are taught by two different background exercisers; for each workout, the instructors are joined by two background exercisers from the main workout.

BONUS UPPER BODY (a.k.a. ""Power Arms"")
Dana leads this workout; oddly, she states at the beginning that it is going to be 12 minutes, but it is actually 14 minutes.  She and the other two exercisers appear to be holding 1-lb. weights; going heavier would be difficult for this segment.  The first half of the workout consists of fast, pulsing moves which hit all angles of the upper body, including shoulders, biceps, and back.  The second half of the workout is focused entirely on triceps.  Here, Dana and crew use just one weight for straight-arm tricep raises and extensions.  However, Dana completely exhausts the triceps by performing these from FOUR positions:  standing, kneeling, kneeling with the head touching the floor, and lying on the stomach.  The segment concludes with 2 minutes of push-up work, with the last set being especially challenging (7 counts down, 1 count up).

BONUS LOWER BODY, (a.k.a. ""Power Thighs"")
This workout is led by Kelly, who is probably the most enthusiastic of the background exercisers (she does a lot of ""whooping"" during the main workout and comes across a bit fake to me).  The first 8.5 minutes of this workout consists of leg lifts performed from two positions:  first, starting on all fours (1 hand/1 forearm) and then, lying flat on the stomach.  A variety of moves are performed, including both bent and straight leg and diagonal leg raises to the side. For the final 5.5 minutes of this segment, you are lying on your side in an ""L"" shape; from this position, you perform additional leg lifts as well as leg circles.  I liked this section overall, although it had a very ""80s"" feel to me, from the music to Kelly's Jane Fonda-like instruction.

Before I purchased this DVD, I had heard that it was worth it for the Bonus segments alone.  Ironically, I liked the main workout better; even if I wanted a shorter workout, I think I would be more inclined to just mix and match segments of the main workout.  It does move quite fast, but I found that it wasn't necessary for me to match Giorla's pace/the beat of the music--if I needed to go more slowly, I did.  Plus, I liked that the workout had a cardio effect (which I found similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>&nbsp;in particular).  The other thing that I LOVED about this workout was that it really does an excellent job at targeting the glutes/backs of the legs and doesn't over-emphasize the front of the thighs.

So, in the end, although this DVD has some flaws as noted, if you are an intermediate or above exerciser and are not afraid to modify the workout to make it fit your needs, I would definitely recommend it.",1302998400,19,8111,5.224884080370943
3971476,4,B002R7R87W,"I really enjoy this dvd. I use it when I want to get some cardio in for the day and I don't feel like going on the treadmill.

Pros:

-As the dvd promised, there's no jumping or similar strenuous moves.
-Lot of repetition which I like and I generally enjoy barre workouts.

Cons:

-Some of the movements are too quick that I'm not sure if the movements are effective for me.

Some people complain of the music, but I don't really notice because I'm concentrating on the workout. I recommend this dvd to people who want a fast paced, cardio and love barre workouts.",1293753600,6,564,4.384615384615385
3971477,3,B002R7R87W,"If you like barre workouts, this will be a nice complement to an already good collection.  The moves are effective and you do work up quite a sweat.  You will like this if you are the type who feels like they need to move a lot and sweat during a workout (most barre type workouts focus on smaller deeper movements, and newbies to bar workouts may miss the heart-racing frenzied pace of traditional cardio-Cardio Barre workouts does give you a faster paced, higher energy workout).  The moves are very difficult and it provides a lot of room for growth- no plateauing on this one.  The bonus workouts are absolutely amazing (led by different instructors).  They will work you very thoroughly in a a short amount of time.

However, the poor music and production quality does detract from the overall quality. For the price one is paying, you would expect better production and music.  For instance, the video is called ""Ultimate Advanced""- yet, the title screen reads ""Advanced Ultimate"" (and it looks like someone just typed it in on a Power Point Slide).  While that may not seem like that big a deal, it's the title for heaven's sake!!  The music is horrible and gets more and more annoying.  I thought I would get used to it, but I actually am beginning to dread working out to this because I know I will hate the music.  It really is that bad.  Again, for the price you pay, you would expect better production quality.  At one point, the scene changes, with the screen fading away into a checkerboard pattern and then swirling off into a corner of the screen. Very cheesy and looks like something you would see in a Power Point presentation, not on what is supposed to be a high quality DVD.  And remember, this DVD is based on a class with an actual studio, so again, my higher expectations were not met.

If you are starting out to Barre workouts, I would go with anything done by Exhale Core Fusion.  The price is lower and the production quality is so much better, and the moves are just as (if not more) effective.  If you already have a good variety of barre workouts and need something to throw into the mix to alleviate boredom, or if you are the traditional type of exerciser that likes heart pumping cardio, then this would be of benefit to you.  I do barre workouts, but don't use this very often. I find myself going back to Exhale Core Fusion, Tracy Anderson Method, Bar Method, or Physique 57.  I do the bonus workouts when I am short on time and I do this one, but not very often.",1283904000,9,2499,4.47682119205298
3971478,4,B002R7R87W,"I recently moved out of the country, from Los Angeles CA to Aruba, and it is so nice that Cardio Barre offers dvds. I loved working out at the Studio City location and really missed the girls, energy, and pure fun that this workout offerers. It was so nice to see my former instructors instructing me on this at home dvd! It was so nice finding this dvd. I am here in Aruba and am still getting the great workout that I use to get in the classes. This was a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to tone up, burn fat, and feel great!",1278288000,5,550,4.009090909090909
3971479,5,B002R7R87W,"This is a very challenging workout.  You get both toning and cardio in one - very efficient and without the high impact jarring to your body.  You do not need the barre; I just use a chair and it works fine.  Yes, the music is not very good, but I hardly noticed it because I was concentrating on the movements and feeling the burn.  I found the instructor to be both engaging and funny and his cuing was good.  The bonus upper and lower body workouts were excellent; both of the instructors (Dana and Kelly) were awesome and extremely motivating.  This workout is definitely a keeper.",1273708800,9,585,4.471698113207547
3971480,2,B002R7R87W,"This workout would be great if the music wasn't so horrific and outdated- a repetitive jazz beat. The instructor's constant prompts, encouragements and individual shout outs by name to each ballet babe behind him gets VERY annoying. However, the prompts are somewhat necessary because each exercise keeps building to become humorously frantic and jarring. The instructors running commentary about ""being a winner and not being a looser"" and ""going for your goals and not giving up...yada yada"" were cliche, boring, and mindless background chatter. I strongly encourage you to turn the sound way down and put on your own music if you're going to do this workout! The toning and ballet inspired moves are effective and challenging overall if you can ride out the pace without tearing something. The arm section using 1 Lb weights was not very creative and again done in a whirlwind of crazy hurried movements that seemed unnecessarily fast. The mat work and leg toning felt great and were done at the right pace. I prefer Tracy Anderson's Mat workout over this since she selects awesome music that is actually enjoyable to listen to, and offers many of the same toning benefits as this claims to deliver. I've done this DVD twice now and find its many quirks just too annoying to push through. I'm putting this one back on the shelf.",1273536000,28,1331,4.893805309734513
3971481,4,B002R7R87W,This was a very different workout and I did not have to modify much in it.  I am a former athlete with a spinal disc injury.  I usually find exercise programs either not challenging enough or much too impactful on bones/joints etc.....in order for them to get my heartrate up or work muscles.  I did not have any of those issues with this program.  Richard is funny.....obviously a classic dancer...and I appreciated that...given my background as a competitive athlete.  It is NOT for the faint of heart...so beware....if you want something easy - Do NOT get this....if you want a challenge that is easy to work with and does not cause undo stress on joints...this is for you!  Enjoy!,1271116800,7,684,4.705882352941177
3971482,5,B002R7R87W,"I can't say this workout is ""fun"", because it's so fast, it's kind of jarring compared to most ballet workouts, but it's very effective and will get you the cardio and toning you need in minimal time. I'm an advanced exerciser and my goal is to maintain a lithe and lean dancer's physique as opposed to a muscular gym rat body. I've been practicing Tracy Anderson's method but like to alternate with other DVDs every other day.  To do Tracy Anderson's high impact dance workout as part of the cardio requirements daily is too hard on the joints and I need variety between her mat workouts to help with boredom. This Cardio Barre incorporates the same principles by repeatedly working the smaller accessory muscles that sculpt a lean body. It's a very rigorous yet low-impact workout that will definitely make you sweat, keeping you challenged, and I think pleased with the results. I also highly recommend Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body and Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning as well as Cathe's MMA::fusion DVDS for cardio, as they really work the core and use a lot of lateral moves while not over-developing the larger muscle muscle groups.",1270339200,55,1141,4.881443298969073
3971483,5,B002R7R87W,This workout is great!  You get a great cardio workout with no impact and no need for shoes.  I workout 3 to 4 times a week.  I love this workout because it is challenging without being hard on your joints.  It is not for beginners but is a great way to get in shape and burn some calories.,1269216000,2,290,3.9482758620689653
3971484,5,B002R7R87W,"Cardio Barre: Ultimate Advanced DVD is a great, challenging workout that doesn't even require putting on sneakers. I think the smaller movements with higher repetitions work the muscles in a different way and that the desired higher tush is achieved more rapidly than by doing squats and lunges (which are monotonous). This is a comprehensive full body workout that incorporates light weights and some great abdominal exercises too. For this video, since I don't own a barre, I use a chair, 1 pair of 2 lb. dumbbells and a yoga mat for the ab work. I would highly recommend this video.",1267920000,24,585,4.801980198019802
3971485,3,B002R7R87W,"This is a good Barre workout DVD for those who are beginner or medium level.

If you are looking for something very challenging, I really wouldn't suggest this DVD.",1393113600,3,292,4.82
3971486,3,B002R7R87W,"I have recently started doing barre workouts and am still on the fence on this one. While I like that it gets my heart rate up higher than many of the other barre workout dvds, I find the pace almost a bit frantic and do not feel the same immediate benefits I do from other, slower paced barre workouts. If you are looking to use this as a cardio workout, I think it is a decent workout. However, if you are looking to use this for a barre workout, I am not sure I would recommend it.",1391299200,3,484,4.0

The guy is incredibly positive and keeps you motivated throughout - I will consider buying something else of his as I think he is really good. I did ballet for around 15 years, and have done real-life cardio barre classes, so I think I'm experienced enough to give a review for this! It's a great workout, you tone up instantly...the only thing is, as per all real-life ballet, be sure to wear tights so that your thighs don't bulk up. I also like the girls that he has on the video, they are real, and I would say that they do the workouts, they are super fit.",1373241600,4,601,4.234782608695652

I love the fast pace workout, its not boring.  I love the result!  I got my waistline back.  My husband told me that I shrunk.  I am a curvy woman and being 46 years old is not bad.  This workout works for me and I am very grateful.  I usually don't write reviews, but I do believe that the creator of this workout deserves a shoutout of THANK YOU! I got my groove back.

After having hip surgery 6 months ago and no longer able to run, I was unable to find a workout that gave me the results I saw from running.  I have tried other workout dvds but they all made me build and get bigger.  This low impact workout changed my body and has helped me get off the weight!  My hip doesn't hurt, and I began to see changes to my body in only 5 workouts.  My whole body is being sculpted in one workout.",1304726400,15,550,4.102803738317757

The studios are so sleek and modern that I gotta say I was pretty shocked by how cheesy the creator of Cardio Barre is who leads this DVD and, yes the music truly is horrible. I actually had to check the year on it because it seemed so 90s aerobics inspired (copyright 2008, so there is no excuse). However, if you can get past all of that cheese and Mr. Giorla's cliche motivational phrases (""quitters never win and winners never quit!"") it is the same great workout that I love from the studio and damn good sweat from the comfort of your home. Using a chair is a little tricky vs. the ballet bar I'm used to from class, but works ok and I think I'll get used to it.
