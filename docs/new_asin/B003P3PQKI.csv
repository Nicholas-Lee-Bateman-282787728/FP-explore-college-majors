4163455,5,B003P3PQKI,"I bought this for my granddaughter at the last minute because the other movie I order had not arrived in time. She just turned two and if she could watch this 24/7, she would. We have a hard time turning it off, so now we have to limit the time she watches it.
The characters are updated and I think initially she was confused between the old and new characters, but she has taken that all in stride. She is a happy camper when this gets turned on. It's a keeper!!",1290470400,5,464,4.1098901098901095
4163456,1,B003P3PQKI,"Sorry, but one look at the previews tells me that I will not buy these. I prefer the old characters and their charm much better. I'm so sick of the cartoon industry bringing back childhood favorites and 'sexing them up' (think Strawberry Shortcake, etc). Sometimes keeping something the old favorite is far preferable to 'modernizing' it. No thanks!",1287014400,4,349,5.0344827586206895
4163457,4,B003P3PQKI,"My 4-1/2-year-old daughter loves it.  (Of course she is also our little ballerina - she studies ballet and that is why she is so enthralled by the character of Angelina.) She was surprised to see Angelina and Alice in a new form, not like the usual cartoons.  Good animation, simple and very charming.  The stories are great with gentle humor and lessons in the end.

Angelina has grown up a little and is in a new school with a new teacher Ms. Mimi.  My daughter misses some of the intimate characters that are familiar with her, Miss Lilly the most, and so is her little cousin Henry.",1285632000,4,586,4.4392523364485985

4163475,2,B003P3PQKI,"I'm only giving this two stars because my three year old enjoyed it. But as a parent who had to sit through it, this was pretty bad.

Pros:
Positive, nice messages, not too ""dumbed down"" per se, child liked it, a lot about dancing

Cons:
Saccharine, kind of dopey (for lack of a better word), slow, poorly written (they actually used the word ""mouses"" as the plural of mouse in one episode), weird CG graphics

This was actually a handful of short episodes, not an hour long movie like I was thinking it would be. Saccharine is the best single word to describe this. Maybe I have pretty high standards; my child does not watch much TV. She occasionally watches Mr. Rogers or Reading Rainbow, and has watched Curious George with her dad sometimes. We started doing special movie nights once every week or two. She loves ballet, and we like the Angelina Ballerina books, but we will not be watching another one of these. I wish I had previewed it, but instead I went by all the rave reviews.

We'll just stick to the books; those have been great thus far.",1410566400,,1053,4.46875

4163480,5,B003P3PQKI,"I discovered this little dancing mouse quite by accident on a boring rainy Saturday when while channel surfing, I landed at PBS and was captivated by her adorable English Accent and graceful carriage.  Since that time, I have seen every single episode, and decided that it would make a wonderful gift to my two great neices who are both seven years old, one of which is an aspiring ballerina.  Neither had ever seen Angelia before, and I thought that a gift of this particular dvd (my favorite) to both of them would provide a wonderful introduction.  They are both delighted and want to see more of her.

4163503,5,B003P3PQKI,"I found this by accident while searching for a gentle video for my 21 month old granddaughter who is not allowed to watch TV or most videos.  There is just enough singing and dancing to liven things up.  It is divided up into segments so that you can stop at sensible intervals without missing anything. The characters are gentle and the ""lessons"" are provided in well thought out settings that kids can identify with.

4163504,5,B003P3PQKI,My five yr old granddaughter loved it.  I liked it because it showed a little mouse who loved to dance.  She loved it so much that all that mattered was her standing out from the rest and wanting her partner to do exactly what she wanted.  Angelina found out that things don't always go the way she wanted.  She learned that team work isn't always doing the same thing to accomplish the best results.,1369267200,,400,4.364864864864865

It was freezing cold and rainy out, and it kept them (mainly the 6 year old) occupied long enough for me to watch my oldest sons game to through the windshield, as well as also be able to hang with, and care for, my littlest two.

It's got skinny legs.  She doesn't.  In the DVD, she dances ballet to a variety of different kinds of music at her school.  I think I'll keep the doll for a real live ballerina.

It was easy to download and we could cuddle up with her on my lap and watch it on my Kindle Fire HD.  The graphics were great and the characters were very cute.
