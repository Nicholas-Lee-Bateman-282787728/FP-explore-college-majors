8425998,5,B004DTS1AU,VERY interesting! Def worth a look. However this makes itself out to be WAY more interesting than it actually was. But still worth a watch.,1445472000,,139,4.6
8425999,4,B004DTS1AU,"For me this film is a captivating crime thriller and great example of 20th Century noir. The story is plays on mystery, intrigue and suspense in a classic style that is often associated with Italian giallo-most notably Argentos work. Even with the very obvious culture insensitivity that plagues the film, Darkland is a very interesting and mesmerizing story that slowly builds suspense through melodrama and eerie atmospheric effects. I did find the view of pagans, Celts and gypsies as some dehumanized boogeymen wrought with villainous intent a tad offensive, but in proper context as a fictional setting it is easy to swallow.

The sound effects and cinematography used for Darkland is traditional 80s and 90s creepiness one expects in these suspenseful stories. The characters are classic and mysterious, well developed if needed and never over-indulged to the point of annoyance. Visually the film entertains with moments of post-industrial, neo-primal experimental theatrics that creates a wild urban paganism aesthetics. Usually these images are saved for post-apocalyptic or future-dystopia films. The witchcraft, or primitive traditional religious elements where minimal but when on screen became very effective. Mostly this is a great conspiracy, crime noir. Darklands is a very cool, classic cult thriller that offers a great witchy story, and plenty of suspense. The blood and gore is almost non-existent which was a bit of a bummer but over-all I enjoyed the film.",1432512000,,1478,5.426086956521739
8426000,1,B004DTS1AU,"Stupid, idiotic and predictable, if you've seen Rosemary's Baby or The Wicker Man, or any movie centered around a secretive cult, then you pretty much know that said secretive cult is going to run a Dukes of Hazard-style shuck and jive on the main character, shoot him through a circumstantial maze like some mouse going after a mythological piece of cheese that only he thinks exists, and then slam the trapdoor of fate down in the end.  The cult in this movie should be druids; instead we are treated to some heavily mascaraed, Mad Max types that could've also come off of some awful avant-garde Broadway musical.  Acting-wise, it is pretty decent.  Craig Fairbrass is in the lead role of  a credulous reporter-a switch from his usual tough guy roles.  Although the film is Welsh and supposedly deals with Celtic/Druidic lore and issues, the writer/director, Julian Richards, seemed to have focused solely on the human sacrifice and generational regeneration aspect of the religion (nothing, absolutely nothing about nature or any kind of pastoral tie to the land), which coincidentally seems to align with . . . This is not an ""intelligent and literate script"", but instead a by-the-numbers Satan story.  Yawn.  It's been done better by the above movies, or if you really want an obscure classic, The Coffin Joe trilogy.",1364688000,,1323,4.959276018099548
8426001,3,B004DTS1AU,"This is a decent creepy flick I had been trying to track down over the years, and it's finally out on DVD in the States. The good news is that it is a gradually-disturbing flick about a reporter in a small town in England trying to solve a serious of messy 'attacks' on local churches involving bloody messages and 'offerings'. Somewhat similar to THE WICKER MAN (the original classic), this poor guy is gradually heading for the heart of an elaborate secret, which may or may not be his own deathtrap. Acting and the script are good, and you'll sink into the mood of this movie like a bog. There's some great suspense in watching to see if this poor bloke has a chance of leaving town before 'IT' happens.

The bad news (apart from one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a horror flick) is that the quality of the image here is not much better than that of a VHS tape. Though the film is in widescreen, it may very well have been cropped and zoomed-in with portions of the image cropped at the top and bottom, which is unfortunately apparent during one particular bizarre sequence showing some modern day pagan on stilts (their heads are cut off). Also, there are no extras unless Chapter Selection is considered an extra (with nary a trailer).",1353715200,4,1249,4.478070175438597
8426002,1,B004DTS1AU,"Slow pacing, bad direction and acting - this movie was boring from start to finish. And as is the case with these low budget stinkers, you get the fake ""reviews"" by people who worked on it in here. The one other review by someone called ""nymus"" praising this as ""scary!"" is someone who has one other review - ""Summer Scars"" and guess what? Both ""movies"" were directed by someone named ""Julian Richards."" No other reviews. Just two by that guy. So that should tell you who ""nymus"" is. I've said it before, I'll say it again, there should be some rule in Amazon and IMDB that people who worked on these little videos cannot ""review"" them. It's unethical. Keep that in mind when you see reviews like ""nymus's""",1353628800,4,706,4.5234375
8426003,4,B004DTS1AU,"Deep in industrial South Wales, investigative reporter Craig Fairbrass gets into a lot of creepy trouble when he starts to follow a lead on what he thinks is a great scoop - an unsolved disappearance that could be linked to the Welsh nationalists. However, the people he's dealing with are much more dangerous; they belong to a cult that sacrifices animals and humans. This is the kind of film that is destined to become a cult classic: it has an intelligent, literate script and it effectively builds up its suspense. It's also very, very scary",1348963200,3,545,4.747368421052632
8426004,5,B004DTS1AU,"I remember when I use to suck a lot. Then I watched Darklands and suddenly EVERYONE GAVE ME HIGH-F%^#ING FIVES. Forever. Peter Leon is like some kind of electric Jesus of cinematography and he can shot fireballs out of his @$$. Like a boss. This movie changed my life and made me buy watches and wear them as hats, until my entire f$%^ing head exploded. Enjoy this movie and drink it in, like a delicious Sonoran hot dog.",1304640000,,421,4.410256410256411
8426005,5,B004DTS1AU,"A thriller from the start!! The opening scene depicting Tony's lust for larger women engaged me immediately and I could tell it really resonated with the crowd of 1st graders. I gaffawed at Nick and Tony's playful banter and was surprisingly intrigued by the witty social commentary. The graphic, stomach turning violence was almost as titillating as Nick and Tony's bawdy sexual exploits. Darklands is a rollercoaster of emotions, deeply introspective, and a labyrinth of enigmatic plot twists. Darklands just might be the most convoluted cinematic adventure ever to warm your heart and blow your mind.
As a connoisseur of low-budget, B movies with a taste for poorly written scripts and minimal dialogue peppered with vulgarities, I was deeply disappointed when I watched Darklands as it met none of this criteria. An exorbitant amount of money was spent on the cast, crew, and props; Mr. Leon spared no expense on this tour de force. Nick and Tony rejected the first script because the language conflicted with thier devout religious and moral obligations so they ad libbed thier lines much to the confusion of the rest of the cast. Absolutely no editing was done to preserve the amateur and contemptible nature of Peter Leon's films. It was that avantgarde lack of respect and total disregard for the audience that keeps Peter's fans dissatisfied and coming back for more.
I could give this film no more than 5 stars although it probably deserved nearly two. These fine young men rocked my world for 48 action packed minutes, and I can't thank them enough. Bravo, good sirs. Bravo.",1290988800,,1585,4.9849056603773585
8426006,5,B004DTS1AU,"I used to watch silly, stupid movies like Casablanca and The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption. But after seeing Darklands, I've realized that this is the only movie I'll ever need to watch. It has action, romance (bromance), comedy, redemption, tragedy...everything you could ever want!! I've since burned all my copies of those other stupid movies like Vertigo, The Departed, Braveheart, Gone with the Wind...who needs 'em?! Buy Darklands today so your life (like mine) can finally be complete.",1290902400,2,497,5.384615384615385
