8329607,1,B001O4R9RS,"I found very little practical information in this video.  Most of the video is devoted to what he brings in his day pack.  Most of which is from 1985.  He hunts with an outfitter that provides everything.  These hunts are very expensive.  When I here ""How-to"" or ""do it yourself"", I think ""DO IT YOURSELF"".  ie camping gear, cooking gear, etc.  This video is ""how to"" pack your day pack and ""how to"" spend alot on an outfitter.  This video contains little to no actual hunting information and no herd information.  (He doesn't even come close to getting a caribou!)  I would not recommend this video.  If fact if you want it.  I'll give you mine.",1238025600,,646,4.474137931034483
8329608,5,B001O4R9RS,"For those who are considering an guided hunting trip into the Alaska backcountry, BowHunting Alaska is an invaluable video checklist.  A veteran of over half dozen guided trips, Marv Clyncke offers practical advice to time and experienced hunters alike.  The tips could make the different between an OK trip and the trip of a lifetime, as are many of these expeditions.

The presentation is ""old school"", presented in a straightforward style that reminds me of the advice my Grandfather used to give when I was growing up in Alaska.  And the advice is real - from how to find your pack after you drop it in the brush, to obsessively paying attention to personal gear weight, to mentally preparing for the often unsettling remoteness immediately apparent after the guide's plane fades into the mountains.  A highly recommended video.",1237075200,,832,5.0
8329609,5,B001O4R9RS,"If your planning your first trip or its been a while since you have gone to the north country, you will always wonder what you can and can't take on these trips.  The pilots are serious when they tell you to keep your weight down to 60-65 lbs of gear, it could make  a difference on you making it out alive or not. pay close attention to what Marv Clynke is telling you. You will stay at or under the required weight and stll have enough equipment to get you through a bad situation if it comes up.",1237075200,,498,4.071428571428571

8329611,4,B001O4R9RS,I really enjoyed watching Marv go through his backpack and seeing stuff that I wouldn't have ever thought of. This video will help you simplify what you will need to take with you on your 1st or 10th trip to alaska. Some nice video of alaska's wild country also.,1236902400,,262,4.36734693877551
8329612,2,B001O4R9RS,I was expecting more useful information to help in planning my upcoming trip to Alaska to hunt Black Bear. It had a lot of good info for beginning type hunters but there could have been so much more.,1236384000,,199,4.2631578947368425
