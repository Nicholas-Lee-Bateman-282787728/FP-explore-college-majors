7914718,5,B00001RMF9,"The Colorado River has so much more to offer to the fly fisher than I would have ever expected.  This video provides you with a overview of some of the most fantastic scenery you could ever imagine.  The only problem I would have is concentrating on my presentation of a fly in such surroundings.  From accommodations available to some of the best crystal clear water fishing video I have watched, the Colorado River Lees Ferry video offers it all.  The only thing that tops the spectacular scenery is the fishing.  Do yourself a favor and experience this trip for yourself.",1022457600,,574,4.7
7914719,1,B00001RMF9,"Never having gone Fly Fishing, I thought this video would ""turn me on"" to this sport I've heard so much about. It had the OPPOSITE effect! This video focuses on all the wrong things to get someone started, and interested, in Fly Fishing. Instead of focusing on the natural beauty associated with the sport, it provides too much detail about the nitty gritty of knot tying, fly selection, leeaders, lines, etc......just enough to ""turn me off"".  I was ready to hit the ""rewind"" button after just ten minutes of viewing, and try to improve my golf game instead!",982022400,9,559,4.704081632653061
7914720,5,B00001RMF9,"I started fly fishing a couple of years ago and had some problems getting it all together, but after watching Fly Fishing Basics and the follow up program Beyond the Basics, I really feel I understand what I need to do to get better.
I'm an amatuer photographer and have a home video camera as  well.  I think the quality of these shows and some of the others that I  own, produced by the Watt's are better than what I've seen on network  television.  They're awesome.  Obviously the Watt's are professional movie  makers and I'm sure grateful they've applied their skills to my favorite  pastime.
Thanks Jim & Kelly for making such beautiful video's.",956361600,39,651,4.649122807017544
