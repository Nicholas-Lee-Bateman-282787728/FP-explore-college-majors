8018790,5,B0001ZDLQO,Very good for beginners. I have been teaching guitar for a long time. The step by step is not boring and keeps the student engaged. This is not the first time I have used this particular lesson and definitely will not be the last.,1477353600,,230,4.25
8018791,3,B0001ZDLQO,"This book/CD combination definitely lives up to it's billing. The course is for someone who has no experience with guitar or bass. Unfortunately, because I've been playing guitar for a few years, it's really too basic for me.

If you are a true beginner who has never picked up a bass or guitar before this is a good, basic start, but you'll be moving on quickly. For those who alread have even a little experience with guitar scales, notes on the fretboard and basic rhythm playing, this course is not for you.

I give it 3 stars because it is as advertised, but I expected a few more in-depth lessons at least.",1144627200,6,612,4.455357142857143
