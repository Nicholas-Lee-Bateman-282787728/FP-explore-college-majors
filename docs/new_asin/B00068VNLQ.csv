8040481,5,B00068VNLQ,"I have used this stretch routine for years,  but realized that if I wanted to buy any more copies, I wouldn't be able to find them anymore.  They were on Amazon - and I found 4 copies!  I kept one and gave one to each of my daughters.  It's the best and most relaxing stretch routine I've found and when I wear the one I have out, I'm glad I have a backup.",1356739200,,356,3.835616438356164
8040482,5,B00068VNLQ,This video is a short complete stretching routine. I used it separately from the other videos. The moves are simple and she is easy to follow. Lots of good angles to make sure you're doing it correctly. She moves at a pace fit for anyone.,1312070400,,238,4.311111111111111
8040483,5,B00068VNLQ,This is a really good stretching exercise.  On days that you can't or don't feel like working out this is a good stretch.,1305936000,,121,4.260869565217392
8040484,4,B00068VNLQ,This video was recommended to me by my massage therapist.  The stretches are very do-able and the length of time-- @ 15 minutes-- makes it possible to add to your morning routine or append to any workout.,1267056000,,204,4.513513513513513
8040485,1,B00068VNLQ,When I never received it?  Hmmmmm you should have checked that you guys at Amazon.,1210550400,,82,4.466666666666667
