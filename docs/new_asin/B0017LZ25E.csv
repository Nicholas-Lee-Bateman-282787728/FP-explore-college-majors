8266522,5,B0017LZ25E,"The tail end of the trilogy of DVDs produced by Big Vision Entertainment. The 3rd season is the be all end all of what was XPW Wrestling. The last of the wild storylines, insane matches, and struggles for power within the company. This season also highlighted the move from West Coast to East Coast as ECW went out of business.",1242950400,3,327,4.466666666666667
8266523,1,B0017LZ25E,"I,ll start out by saying that the greatest thing about this series of dvd,s from xpw,s seasonal shows is the fact that they are produced on disc by Big Vision. Big Vision does a fabulous job always and even produces and packs the disc so well they don't get scratched,but when you have a piece of crap to produce no matter how good you are you still have a piece of crap. Here is a dvd season 3 that is bascially all vinettes with such loosers as Playboy Buddy Rose who must way about 400 pounds now in a tub getting rubbed down by 2 hoes. If the set would give you whole matches in their entirety you would not mind as they advertise they have all these matches on them. What the discs have are matches that are cut and you start enjoying the match and then they cut to another scene. Save your money and buy some of the other series of hardcore wrestling dvd,s that have just matches. Its a damn shame that the matches xpw had were some of the greatest hardcore matches but when they cut them so bad that you actually just turn them off its a hint to save your money and buy some of the ECW or CZW dvd,s.",1221523200,,1106,4.1013824884792625
8266524,5,B0017LZ25E,I love this dvd. The drama is awesome. I would recommend it for almost any hardcore wrestling fan.,1220054400,2,98,4.5
8266525,1,B0017LZ25E,"Okay...as with Seasons 1 & 2, the Episodes feature contained some of the WORST attempted wrestling entertainment I've seen to date and the rather good material was found under the Matches/Bonus feature. More Rivera and Kloss than I wanted to stomach, and little/no action in it's entirety.

This time around I was prompted to address the antics of Rob Black and whoever else is in charge of the XPW creative team:

1)Why the racial undertones (I was very UNflattered by the whole 'N'Clause and SULU ordeal...Rob, you looked nothing short of IGNORANT)

2)In an attempt to be 'XTREME' it seems that Rob Black and his crew grasp for straws(we have everything from his right hand man Kraq being into boys to a stalker ex-husband turning out to be a skinhead).

3) ROB, ROB, ROB...is Luis Cypher for real? I was sickened by the 'target practice' via the photos of ethnic celebrities/leaders and thought it to be a bad gimmick gone awry till I saw the skinhead tattoos and the Hatebreed(a known skinhead rockband) shirts. That coupled with the ethnic jokes about Asians and African-Americans? Completely TASTLESS. Rob...even Vince McMahon and Eric Bishop knew better.

4)Oh, before I forget...can you say FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, boys & girls?Perhaps one of the biggest disappointments(next to the skinhead Luis Cypher and all of his Nazi salutes) was the anticipation(at least throughout discs 1 & 2) of the long awaited clash between Sabu and Japanese hardcore pioneer, Onita. There're commercials, interviews, and even a press condference...but unless there's a hidden feature somewhere on the disc...THERE IS NO SABU VS. ONITA...only footage of Onita in a barbedwire match in Japan. Thus, Rob Black fails to deliver the ONE good main event as was done with Seasons 1 & 2 with Abdullah the Butcher and Terry Funk.

Same plusses here as Seasons 1 & 2...but even bigger minuses. On top of that...the footage is dated(2000-01) and having heard that there was a recent reunion PPV, there'll probably be more sets like this to come covering the years 2001-2008. ECW of the West Coast? NOT. A circus? YES.",1219708800,2,2092,4.979942693409742
