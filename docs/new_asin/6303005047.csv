7834720,1,6303005047,One of the best martial arts movies of all time.  Why does the description say Dubbed in English???  It is not dubbed.  I am going to attempt to send it back.,1430006400,,158,4.032258064516129

7834722,2,6303005047,Its a known fact that the dubbed version of this movie is a comedy.  The non-dubbed version of this movie is no fun.  Its just a bad kung fu movie that takes itself too seriously.  I wish the DVD came in the dubbed version so we could make fun of it.,1233014400,,250,3.8627450980392157
7834723,4,6303005047,"I like this film becuase it is one of the most crazed films I have seen with Sonny Chiba in it. Come on a fat chick on aphrodisiacs!! crazed henchmen with hilarious powers!! Some weird looking bum!! Man life couldn't be any better. But the ending is why I gave it four stars it made no sense it gave me no closure. The film is still good though, if your not a very serious person about these types of films.",1137888000,5,407,4.1
7834724,5,6303005047,"One of the more interesting Ninja Wars films, NOT - But YES. I am happy to present this review of this ""special"" addition to the Ninja ""genre.""
There are several films with the name ""Ninja Wars."" I found that I had, not just one but, two copies of THIS Gem. A ""kind of"" accidental enrichment. Take note.
This film has it all: Good Japanese film dubbed into English and subsequently the dialogue is ruined? Flying Ninjas. ""Sinister"" Plots to overthrow rival Ninja Clans. Tears of raped virgins used to make an aphrodisiac? Vomiting Devil-Monks? Heads cut off and replaced on other bodies? ""Naked"" fat and ""naked"" thin japanese women in a Japanese film? Hoards of rival Temple Mongers attacking another Temple? Burning Buddha Temples?
My God. I loved this film. Lots of surprises.
Whip out that credit card NOW. Buy this film, without delay, from ME, and be sure to pay top dollar for a good copy (mine).
If you do NOT have this film in your collection and you have ANY interest in Martial Arts Films, shame on you. This film is now THE most cherished and important film in my collection - at least in my Martial Arts Collection.
P.S.: I AM one of the Devil-Monks. Really. But, I do not Vomit? Really.",1122940800,,1199,4.5813953488372094
7834725,4,6303005047,I rented this movie from a video store back in the late 80's and I have never forgotten it.  Projectile vomiting and some of the cheesiest dialog ever!,1055808000,2,151,4.392857142857143
7834726,4,6303005047,"When my friends and I found this old, beat up VHS tape with no jacket and the words ""Ninja Wars"" written on the label at our local video store for $4 it was too hard to resist.
What then followed is pure ninja gold.  It's very similar to Shogun Assassin in that although this movie may once have been half credible in it's original Japanese language version the English dub is completely ludicrous.
From narators preaching the virtues and powers of the Spider Tea Kettle to the machinations of the mysterious Kashin Koji this movie has it all.  Violence! Gore! Beheadings! Naked Women! Ninjas!
Uncover the secrets of the Diamond Hand Technique!  Learn how to make magic potions using the tears of an abused woman!  Discover to how to speak weird orange bile into the face of your enemies!
B-Grade re-dubbed ninja action at it's best!

7834727,5,6303005047,"I watched this film as a child and it has stayed with me always. My dad hired it from a now defunct video shop...I bought the exact same one from a junk shop in Dover. The film is dubbed (but big budget for the time). It is packed with the dark arts, aphrodisiacs procurred from fallen women, martial arts, blood, guts, spew...the whole kit. A must have for collectors of classic 80's mythological- ninja slasher
Synopsis: Samurai retainer & meglomaniac, Danjo, wants to ovethrow his lord to rule province but can only do it by making the lord's wife fall for him. Danjo enlists the aid of five screwed up devil-monks. (the one little scab with an afro is cool). Ninja hero (Jotaru) has girlfriend captured by monks who cut of her head and place it on the body of a maid. She the becomes lady hellfire. Very complexing script...but a certified must-have.
P.S For God's sake man, bring it out on DVD!",1025740800,5,899,4.521472392638037
