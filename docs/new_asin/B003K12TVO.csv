movies and he gives his all in this but this is not a movie!
it's a tv series! Armchair thriller. and it's not very good.
I love mysteries and horror but this was a short boring story.
Try Con Man before this! I got on vhs and it's one of the best
movies Ian ever made! unless you have to everything he made skip it!",1325030400,,377,3.8461538461538463
