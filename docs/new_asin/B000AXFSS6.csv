2394759,4,B000AXFSS6,"I watched this with my grandaughter tonight. She is five. We enjoyed it together.

She has watched this and other Spanish children's videos before. Tonight she choose this one to watch. When a child chooses to watch, they are willing to learn.

In addition to being a review for me, she and I are developing a shared vocabulary. That is, I know what she is learning so we can converse in Spanish.

The video mixes live and animated video. It uses animation to emphasize the object being discussed. It is effective. However, an adult finds it a little stilted. Children do not seem to care.",1149292800,19,589,4.59047619047619
2394760,5,B000AXFSS6,"I bought Spanish for Kids volume 2 because my daughter and I really enjoyed the first volume by Language Tree.  She's currently fixated on learning different languages (something I hope she continues) and the previous video is one of her favorite ""learning tools"".

This DVD provides a good introduction to words and phrases related to telling time, eating lunch, and playing.  We particularly liked the segment where the kids played the Spanish-speaking world's national pastime of futbol (soccer) while teaching words related to the sport and playing.

The DVD moves at a pretty brisk pace but this was OK because there was a lot of repetition.  There is also a function to turn on/off subtitles in Spanish and English.  This was very useful to test our comprehension of what we had just learned.

Overall, highly recommended!",1140220800,35,828,5.044117647058823

8080089,5,B000AXFSS6,"My two year old granddaughter loves this series (we have vol 1 and vol 2). We watch it over and over at her request. She can count to diez without prompting already and is learning colors and phrases. The pace is good, the speech is clear, so even I can understand the pronunciation. The live action and animation mix well. There are some quizzes which are easy, but you have to use the remote control, which can be a little tricky, and an adult or older child would have to manage the remote. Although if you ignore the questions the action moves forward anyway and the whole time you still are hearing the Spanish words. The action centers around simple activities of interest to young children like a birthday party and a picnic and the vocabulary centers around those activities: counting the slices of birthday cake, naming the colors or the balloons, naming the picnic foods, etc. The phrases are also linked to the themes and are generally common useful phrases like thank you, I like it very much, what time is it, etc. There are also songs to reinforce the lessons which are simple and appealing.",1420243200,3,1105,4.614213197969543

8080091,1,B000AXFSS6,"I was very disappointed with both the quality of the video and the amount of content for the price. Also parts of the video seemed disjointed as if part of the video was left out. I bought it because the reviews were positive. I have a hard time believing that other people thought that this was a good product. The format might make a good app, but if they want to sell it as a video, it needs more content!!!",1402876800,,410,4.1375
8080092,4,B000AXFSS6,Nice way  to introduce both languages. I knew my grand-daughter was going into a dual language program and it gave her a good start.,1382659200,,132,4.5
8080093,1,B000AXFSS6,"I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. In fact I was going to call Amazon & ask if I could return it for a refund! They spent too much time traveling around ""cartoon"" land and with the ""talking tree guy"" and way too little time on just plain teaching Spanish with plenty of repitition for anyone to learn much from it.",1347408000,5,321,4.193548387096774
8080094,2,B000AXFSS6,"I purchased both vol. 1 and 2 and was not very happy with my purchase. They do not repeat enough, plus if you have a young child watching, someone has to be present to move through the exercises. My granddaughter likes the info but gets frustrated because she needs someone there to get through the reinforcement exercises. Even I found that I needed to hear them pronounce the words more for better reinforcement. I could not even back it up during the playing to re-listen. I do not recommend these DVD's.",1316563200,,507,4.582417582417582
8080095,5,B000AXFSS6,Spanish is sooo much easier to learn for children when there's entertainment included. The language and intonations will expose the children to another voice than the teacher's or the Spanish news channel. All for stimulation and education.,1260316800,,240,5.513513513513513
8080096,5,B000AXFSS6,"I loved this video because they teach on the level of toddlers.  This video held the attention of my 4 year old son, and he retained alot of the info the first time around.",1242950400,8,172,4.0588235294117645
