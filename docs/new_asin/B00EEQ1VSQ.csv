It is a beautiful movie with a bit of a pessimistic tone, but it's more pathos than dreariness. The era, the scenery, the cinematography and acting are all beautiful. However, if you are not prepared for troubled relationships as a centerpiece, you may be disappointed. This movie plumbs some of the darker depths of personal relationships.

THE PLOT: Marie Kroyer is a beautiful, young, trained artist who is married to P.S Kroyer of Denmark. P.S. Kroyer is the most renowned Scandinavian painter of his time (arguably of all time). He is much older than her in the movie (in real life he was around 16 years her senior). They are the ""IT"" couple of their day. The beautiful Marie also serves as Kroyer's muse and was featured in many of his paintings, some of the most celebrated in fact. She was considered one of the most beautiful women in all of Europe through the fame of his art. However, mental and physical issues were robbing Soren (Mr. Kroyer) of his senses to the point he even appears to be a danger to his family. This wears on their relationship. Marie later meets a young Swedish composer, Hugo Alfven, and falls in love with him. As their affair progresses, she becomes pregnant and fantasizes they can be married. The movie depicts this idea as not necessarily shared by Hugo.

This is a gorgeous and well acted movie, but not necessarily gripping at every moment. Marie will make many sacrifices that affect more than just her relationships with men. She already has a daughter with Soren Kroyer. The movie can be painful to watch at times. Her decisions are not always the best depending on ones viewpoint. The movie does not focus on events later in Marie's life or her personal successes. Indeed, the movie portrays Soren as appreciating and encouraging Marie as an artist, but not really holding her in esteem as an artist. The movie also does not indicate that she eventually becomes well respected as a furniture and interior designer of a type. Even some of her paintings are held in museums, though she was less productive during the time she was married to Kroyer.

I still really appreciated this movie and found a new favorite actress in Brigitte Hjort Sorensen. Not only was she a revelation, she was chosen because she actually resembles Marie quite well, almost hauntingly so. I thought she was as perfect for the part as anyone could be. Absolutely stunning. I searched for Kroyer's art on-line after watching this movie and found myself appreciating the movie, Marie, and P.S. Kroyer a lot more. I suggest anyone considering this movie without knowing the background may want to do the same thing (unless you are worried about spoilers). I admit I hadn't seen any of the Skagan school of art from that period and I am much the happier for being introduced through this movie.

As you can see, it's mostly adult themes here so I would not call it a family movie and it's not strictly an entertainment piece. There are some scenes of intimacy, but fairly shaded, barely hints of nudity at those times. There was a scene from behind of Soren in an asylum where he is being hosed down after it appears he has fowled himself. As I mentioned, it can be a little gritty or realist at times rather than romantic. Unless one has a strong interest in dissecting broken relationships, or in Scandinavian Cinema, this movie is likely only a rental. The price at time of writing ($25 Amazon US) is actually pretty cheap for top foreign cinema without a formal US release. You might be able to get it cheaper by searching Amazon Germany or UK. This disc does require Region Two capability so it will not work on strictly region 1 (US)players. Perhaps it will have a US release soon.",1402272000,5,3845,4.65
