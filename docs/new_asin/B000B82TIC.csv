8083137,2,B000B82TIC,"kind of disappointed to find it more of a lecture than a movie.. It would've been awesome to see a real action packed movie with today's high tech special effects to portray the Power and Glory of our Lord!  presentation's informative, and special effects' very mediocre..",1460419200,,272,4.913043478260869

8083142,5,B000B82TIC,"i wasn't sure to order this book of revelation, i thought maybe it will have actors and actress to act the story of revelation, yet my holy spirit told me the words are being narrated only...so its great to have for someone who has some type of handicap problems such as sight, etc ...however, i know our lord and savior will blessed me to find other use for this book of relevations....its always beautiful to have gods words around you, in you and though you...AMEN...still iam bless to have this in my collection...thank you jehovah though the blood of christ jesus and secondly thank you amazon for having this book.....",1330473600,4,624,4.681818181818182
8083143,1,B000B82TIC,"My Sunday School class is studying Revelation and I thought it would be awesome if we could watch some sort of animation of it because so many people (myself included) was having a hard time visualizing it.  I found this DVD and thought I would surprise my class.  I received it in the mail last week and popped it in my DVD player at home as soon as I got the wrapping undone.

This is the worst visual representation for Revelation I have ever seen and a complete rip off.

It is basically a Powerpoint slide show.  I could do this on my home computer for free.  Imagine my surprise when I hurridly skipped to Chapter 6 so I could see the awesome visage of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and for the ""pale horse of death"" saw only a normal horse with the ""negative"" photo option selected.  I could have just looked at some old Kodak film I got of a horse through my bedside lamp if I wanted that kind of effect.  And I wouldn't have had to pay any more money!

I reiterate: There is little to none actual animation, it is 99% just pictures (and bad ones at that) with the words of Revelation copied and pasted on top of them!

I don't know how in the world someone justified charging (...) for this horrid video, but I could have had better pictures of Revelation if I had asked the 1st grade class at Church to color pictures using crayons.

The person who wrote the positive review had to have been the person who made the video, because there is no way that anyone would say ""The colors leap off the screen while sound effects and images present Revelation as never seen before"" unless they were the ones that made the video. Or they had been blind their entire life and this video was the first thing they had seen when their vision had been restored.

There is absolutely no reason to buy this DVD.  I would have given it 0 stars if that were an option, even though if probably deserved -5 stars so it would negate the +5 stars that the other reviewer gave it.",1267401600,13,1972,4.268817204301075
8083144,5,B000B82TIC,"Of the set of 12, I found this DVD to be most riveting. The Book of Revelation opens up and comes alive while you watch this video. The colors leap off the screen while sound effects and images present Revelation as never seen before, and because its word for word, you know nothing has been left out. I highly recommend this DVD if you want to ""watch"" the book of Revelation from beginning to end with no interuptions! (...) Five stars solid!",1126051200,17,443,4.414634146341464
