8288895,5,B001CR49A2,"This is wonderful.  The narrative by Celia Sandys, Churchill's granddaughter, is insightful and personal.  The history and personal stories rekindle admiration and respect for the Goliath of a man that Winston Churchill was.  The paintings show an even deeper more sensitive quality inherent in the brilliant world leader.  It is a fascinating portrayal.  I am sharing my DVD with friends to rave reviews.",1423180800,4,405,5.365079365079365
8288896,4,B001CR49A2,"a labor of love, but a familial tribute, not an undying monument. The depiction of Churchill's elder years seems to tarnish his past greatness.",1376524800,,143,5.0
8288897,5,B001CR49A2,until viewing this I had no idea of HOW much Churchill traveled the world.  I thoroughly enjoyed this this set of DVDs.,1356825600,,119,4.409090909090909
8288898,3,B001CR49A2,"The gimmick is the granddaughter of Churchill retraces his steps as a young soldier-adventurer-journalist when he fought and was captured in the long-forgotten Boer War in South Africa. The problem is there is so much more, even up to the point at which this documentary abruptly stops, well before World War I when Churchill hit his first peak. Perhaps, this is a series that will continue. But this film even leaves out his interesting times in India as a soldier in favor of his adventures in New York and Cuba when he became a weird hybrid of a soldier who also wrote newspaper dispatches for the folks back. You don't see that any more. Worth a peek, but you'll be left wanting.",1356480000,,683,4.60655737704918
8288899,3,B001CR49A2,"I liked the format--and the personalization, but the time frame covered was very brief. It felt as though it should have been part of a series, rather than standing on its own. More like a snapshot than a movie. As a result, I would have to say it is a bit overpriced.",1316563200,2,268,4.173076923076923
8288900,2,B001CR49A2,well photographed and boring no wonder they couldn't get funding for a follow up episode.,1269129600,,89,5.0
8288901,5,B001CR49A2,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member after having seen it on public television.  The life of a great man told from the perspective of a granddaughter who knew him so well truly enriches the film.  Ms. Sandys presentation makes the full, colorful, and complex life of Sir Winston Churchill come alive for those of us who have some memory of him as well as for those who were born long after he passed from the world stage.  This film should be in the collection of any fan of 20th century history.",1234051200,15,506,4.3052631578947365
8288902,5,B001CR49A2,"I just viewed this three-part PBS program last night, was pleasantly surprised by it's excellent content, and just had to make a few comments about it.

Churchill's granddaughter, Celia Sandys, takes us on an inspiring, well-produced travel log-type documentary as she visits some of the places around the world her grandfather traveled to throughout his life.  I've studied the achievements of this amazing leader for years now, yet I learned many new and interesting facts previously unknown to me as a result of this program.  Even the background musical soundtrack was outstanding.

It would be well worth devoting three hours of your viewing time to learn about this Titan of world leadership.  After seeing this wonderful program, I couldn't help but think how desperately the present world needs visionary statesmen of Churchill's caliber.

Let us all be grateful for the foresighted statesmanship of this remarkable man - and learn from the example he set in this area.  The lessons gleaned are as applicable and relevant now as they were then, and even more so as we face the daunting challenges of the 21st century.",1219881600,27,1125,5.081521739130435
