8072745,4,B000A2WGTG,"The Disco Biscuits' ""Live at the Palladium"" is a great live experience. For this 5-8-04 show, the band is in top form. The DVD successfully shows the Disco Biscuits' jamband trance adventure. Many fan favorites are here like 'House Dog Party Favor' and 'Morph Dusseldorph.' Pink Floyd's 'Run Like Hell' is a treat. The bonus disc features a large block of music from the New Year's Eve 2002 show. Featurettes include fan interviews and backstage pass, a montage. Between both discs, the large quantity of material makes ""Live at the Palladium"" a great value.  The audio is excellent, although it seems odd that it wasn't mixed for surround sound in this day and age. While the video is very good, the final transfer added enough pixilation to make this look like a great fan made project. The video and audio editing are both well done.
