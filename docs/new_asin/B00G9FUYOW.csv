8621447,5,B00G9FUYOW,"This is a great workout. I'm in my mid-20s and an avid exerciser. It is challenging enough, but not so challenging that you are constantly out of breath or struggling to keep up. Lisa offers modifications for practically all the exercises. You will work your arms, abs, thighs, and glutes, interspersed with three-minute cardio bursts, all before a nice relaxing stretch.

You will need a mat and a pair of hand weights or dumbells. She recommends having a pair each of ""light"" weights and ""heavy"" weights (which for me, were 3 lbs and 5 lbs), although I'm sure you'd still get a great workout with only the ""light"" (2-3 lbs) hand weights.

In the beginning, you can choose to play the workout with the music or without music. I think this is a great option for people who want to exercise to their own playlist while still getting the instructions. I wish more fitness DVDs were like this.

I love Lisa from her videos on Popsugar and this DVD was just as great! The moves were different from the Popsugar videos so it is well worth your money.",1510617600,,1045,4.547872340425532
8621448,5,B00G9FUYOW,"I love this DVD! It's my go-to at home or travel workout. It's the perfect mix of Pilates, cardio and weights and is an amazing workout every time I do it. I love Lisa's instruction style, she makes the workout fly by!",1486166400,,218,4.214285714285714
8621449,5,B00G9FUYOW,"This is a nice workout.  I have had both knee and neck surgery, and this does not bother me.  It is a bit easier than some.  Even if you are more advanced with weight training, I would still say that this is a good one to use when you need a lighter day.  I like her voice too: not jarring or too loud.  She does a good job explaining what she is doing.",1454544000,,353,3.780821917808219
8621450,5,B00G9FUYOW,"Really enjoy this workout. I think it has a good balance of cardio and strength building exercises. Lisa is easy to follow and does not have an overly peppy manner like some other instructors, which is not my cup of tea. Glad I have purchased this.",1444780800,,248,4.413043478260869
8621451,5,B00G9FUYOW,"What a pleasant surprise. I am not a big Pilates fan--I'm usually bored and uninspired. But I was drawn to the 80s art house music and Corsello's style, and I had a blast. She works the entire body using the usual Pilates moves, but she gives clear instruction and imagery to help you along. She has a calm style and is immensely likable. I felt most soreness in my triceps, but I felt pleasantly buzzing in my muscles all over as well as stretched out. This is a hidden gem, and I hope Corsello does more.",1418601600,,506,4.28125
8621452,5,B00G9FUYOW,An amazingly challenging workout using only your body weight and light hand weights!  I definitely feel the burn!,1417392000,,113,5.277777777777778
8621453,5,B00G9FUYOW,"I took a day to relax and did this DVD,I was sooo wrong! This is a great DVD!,thanks to amazon for selling it,because I was contacting the store directly and could not buy it through them. Worth the money and it makes honor to the title! Yes you will burn! And no shoes required! Pair of 2-3 pound hand weights and mat and you are all set. Enjoy the ride!",1411257600,,355,4.085714285714285
8621454,5,B00G9FUYOW,Awesome workout. As long as I have been working out there were things in this workout that I could not complete.,1407888000,,112,4.380952380952381
