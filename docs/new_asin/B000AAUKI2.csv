8077514,3,B000AAUKI2,My son the Vampire was poor film and sound  quality.  Glen and Genda? was better.  I would not commend these movies.,1354924800,,116,4.428571428571429
8077515,3,B000AAUKI2,This is really a poor quality print of My SON THE VAMPIRE (the american version of Old Mother Riley meets The Vampire) The opening reel is so chopped up you cannot make heads or tails out of the opening theme song and credits. But beggers cannot be choosers. This is the only way to get this rare film and the Video quality is about as good as its going to get for a poor print. So it is worth getting if you wish to see this film.,1170547200,,431,3.9655172413793105
