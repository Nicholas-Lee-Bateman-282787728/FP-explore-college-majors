810647,3,6304232764,"Operation Dumbo Drop is a slightly funny, heart-warming tale of a group of American soldiers, fighting in the Vietnam War, trying to do the right thing.

The story revolves around two Special Forces Captains, Capt. Cahill (Danny Glover) and Capt. Doyle (Ray Liotta).  Capt. Cahill is the older, more relaxed soldier who goes with the flow and isn't afraid to do things in an unconventional method.  Capt. Cahill has assimilated into a local Vietnamese village while monitoring the Ho Chi Minh trail.  Capt. Doyle is the younger, uptight, by the book soldier who is sent in to replace Capt. Cahill.

An unfortunate string of events tips off the Viet Cong to the fact the village is helping the Americans and kill the village's elephant in retaliation.  The two Captains put together a small band of misfits to find a new elephant and deliver it to the village by the end of the week.

The movie is based on a true story.  Violence in the movie is minimal.  It is a refreshing change from the typical violent Vietnam themed movie.  I think the movie is meant to be funny, but I would more describe it as ""cute"".  Not much in this movie really made me want to laugh out loud.  The acting in the movie wasn't bad.  I thought Ray Liotta, Dennis Leary (Lt. Pool), and Dinh Thien Le (Linh) all did an excellent job with their parts.  However, I wouldn't describe the acting by anyone as extraordinary.

The DVD lacks any extras on it.  As mentioned by previous posters, there are no subtitles when the people are speaking Vietnamese.

This isn't one of those movies I'd recommend scrambling out to get.  If you find a good deal on the movie or can find it at a video store to rent, by all means give it a try.  However, I do not think the movie is worth $15.00.  This movie is probably a good compromise between a chick flick to watch with a date and a violent action movie you watch with friends.",1143676800,5,1890,4.470760233918129
810648,2,6304232764,"I really like this movie, USUALLY.  However, what makes it worth watching is the subtitles for the Vietnamese.  When I ordered this DVD, I was expecting subtitles I could read.  The only options for subtitles were ""Spanish"" or ""None"".  I was extremely disappointed and angry that I can't even get subtitles in my own language in America!!!  The storyline is nice because it is based on a true story but when you don't know what the VC are saying, you lose a lot in the emotion of the movie.",1137888000,3,490,4.46067415730337
810649,3,6304232764,"This is a great movie, my only beef with the DVD is the missing subtitles.  Everytime one of the Vietcong speak, you have no idea whats going on because of the missing subtitles.",1117238400,4,178,4.393939393939394
810650,3,6304232764,"It's wartime in Vietnam, and American soldiers inadvertently cause the shooting death of a revered elephant belonging to the citizens of Dak Nhe. Oops. To appease the Vietnamese villagers who loved their mascot, the blundering soldiers (Ray Liotta and Danny Glover) take it upon themselves to replace the punctured pachyderm. Easy as that, they find Bo-Tat (played by Tai) and have her airlifted and gently dropped into the remote area. Interesting, good action, so-so on the comedy.

810651,3,6304232764,"The version I saw in theater had subtitles for what the Viet Cong were saying.  Due to the film being in Full Screen scan and pan the subtitles for the Vietnamese is missing, so you're missing out on 25-50% of the story of what's going on.  Additionally you miss the final comment by the VC soldier, which was funny.  It's still a great movie, but Disney really screwed this release up by not reformatting the subtitle to fit the full frame edition they stuck it in.

** EDIT**  Had English subtitles on, so the Vietnamese wasn't shown as it loaded thru the captions.  I leave my rating at 3 due to no Widescreen version or special features worth mentioning though.  It wasn't a bad movie, it deserves a better DVD treatment, esp from a company like Disney.",1095552000,12,757,4.481751824817518
810652,5,6304232764,"What do you get when you combine:
- a near-retirement, throw-away-the-book officer that has been stationed in the middle of nowhere with no supervision and only Vietnamese for friends for years
- a hardcore airborne officer that goes strictly by the book
- a nearing ETS soldier who's scared out of his shoes that he will be killed just before he catches the freedom bird
- an Iowa farm boy that left the farm to get away from those doggone animals ... animals that never did like him
- a fast-talking romeo-type acquisitions officer
- a cantankerous female elephant
- a Vietnamese boy whose only remaining friend is a cantankerous female elephant
and send the group on a cross country journey through enemy territory?
You get a Walt Disney classic that will have you feeling every possible emotion. I have seen this movie hundreds of times and still end up in tears when I watch it. It is hilarious. Oddly enough, it is based on an actual true event. Only the 101st Airborne would do something like this.
This has my favorite parachuting scene. When they drop Botat out of the plane, her static line has been severed by a bullet and does not pull her chute. Geez, the next couple of minutes will stick with you for the rest of your life!
The casting was absolutely perfect. Each person played his role to the max! This is the movie that really brought Ray Liotta to our attention. Playing opposite Danny Glover was the ideal combination. They really rock in this movie.
Get this one for the entire family to enjoy! Also order the soundtrack. Once you see the movcie, you will picture Botat in the back of that old truck every time you hear ""Hang On Sloopy"" and you will see the flying adventure when you hear ""Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher."" Order both today.",1058659200,10,1764,4.5678233438485805
810653,4,6304232764,"The movie is extremely accurate in its depiction of a US Army Special Forces by-the-book Captain, Ray Liotta, coming to a strategic hamlet in Vietnam to relieve his predecessor, Danny Glover.  The movie is  entertaining but at the same time accurate in many of the details about  this time and war that the rest of Hollywood as chosen to ignore.  To  Hollywood there is no humor in the Vietnam War, except to deride and  satirize the sacrifice of those that served there.  Danny Glover is  excellent as the SF officer who has served his time, but doesn't want to  leave his second family.  Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as the  new guy on the block who has his own view of how things should work.  Even  the performance of Dennis Leary is surprisingly controlled, compared to his  other performances.  The story concerns how these two American officers  conspire to get a replacement elephant for the village, which views it as a  good luck charm, after their own elephant is killed.  The Americans try  every trick in the book, and some not in the book, to get an elephant to  this village.  The story is a true one, although the elephant was not  parachuted into the village as depicted in the movie.  The villagers are  not Hindu, as a previous reviewer claimed.  They are Buddhist, with a  strange smattering of animism, as were so many Nung tribesmen in that  region.  There is very little bad language, no overt violence, no gore, and  no sex scenes.  The movie tells a simple story of kindness, and heroism  during wartime, which is seldom seen in theatres anymore.",944784000,35,1584,4.671532846715328
810654,4,6304232764,"Overall, I thought that it was a great movie, very funny, but I think that they had way too much profanity in it. The actors did a great job, I think that they had fun doing it too. I don't think that they should have had so  much stuff about the Hindu religion, I think that it should have been more  centered on God, and actual events that happened, rather than on what they  don't have proof of. Great movie, I would reccommend it except for the  language. It's funny!",925257600,,471,4.2

810837,5,6304232764,"Although a comedy, this movie is based on events in a true story?!  Only the 101st Airborne would perform such a mission and complete it with the Green Beret!  The Vietnamese were instrumental in the success of such missions.  The Vietnamese Boy Linh, with a cantankerous elephant were central in the success of this movie plus Danny Glover and Ray Liotta were outstanding.  During the Vietnam War, the mountain tribes were real allies with the American military.  This movie accurately demonstrated how covert the NVA were in their operations.  In addition, the flights of military C-130 Cargo planes and helicopters were illustrative of actual military operations in the Vietnam War.  The most outstanding feature of this Disney production was the humanitarian and civilized events that are so exceptional for a wartime movie.  This is a superb family movie and worthy of the 5-star rating for the plus side of our involvements in South East Asia with good humor!",1466640000,,965,5.063291139240507

810968,3,6304232764,"Released in 1995, Operation Dumbo Drop is a Disney flick inspired by the real story of the US Army supplying an elephant for a village during the Vietnam War. Danny Glover and Ray Liotta star as the two officers in charge of the mission assisted by Denis Leary, Doug E. Doug and Corin Nemec.  Dinh Thien Le appears as the boy, Linh, companion of the elephant Bo Tat.

An NCO indirectly linked to the real operation said the movie was much more interesting and fun than the actual event as the mission was pulled off without a hitch with little entertainment value. Being a Disney flick, the combat situations are Yeah, right and no one gets hurt, but thats to be expected. Other than this, its a straight forward dramedy/adventure.

While Im generally not into Disney flicks, its nice to see a more positive side of the war after watching movies like We Were Soldiers, Platoon and A Rumor of War. Believe it or not, there WERE fun, comedic and altruistic occasions over there, every day. Many good Americans perished directly attempting to prevent harm to Vietnamese people. Many risked their lives not in combat, but in aiding civilian villagers in tasks they could not accomplish themselves.  Many worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the Vietnamese, providing food, cooking utensils, clothing and other necessities to those displaced by the conflict. Yes, I realize you could argue that they wouldnt be in such a predicament if there was no war, but don't forget that, generally speaking, the South Vietnamese didn't want communistic rule and the conquest-minded NVA were no angels. Look no further than the incredible killing fields of Cambodia.

I love elephants, so I also appreciate this element. Whats most enjoyable, besides the great cast, are the exceptional Thailand locations. Although there are a few eye-rolling parts, like all Disney movies, a lot was put into making this film. Its a fun adventure reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Unfortunately, there are no key female parts and the ""Yeah, right"" moments are too painful to give a higher rating.

The movie runs 107 minutes.

811410,5,6304232764,"I have been in the Army for more than 12 years now, and I have a hard time understanding why this movie was panned so harshly by critics as being unrealistic.  One critic made the statement that it makes light of a tragic war and misses the whole point of it.  What point is that exactly?  The film was telling a story that happened within that timeframe.  Not every movie about Vietnam has to feature mentally screwed up individuals engaging in heinous acts.  Every soldier can testify that one often sees more funny stuff happen during war than tragic.  I know that may sound strange to the civilian mind but it is true.

Also, not every film that takes place during war should be required to make a political statement.  I love this film because it avoids talking about the protests and everything else that we all know about the time period.  It shows soldiers trying to accomplish something worthwhile in what everyone knows is a very ugly situation.  It was no different in Iraq.  The soldiers who served there may not have agreed with the big political situation, but small units accomplished some amazing things in their little corner of the events that were going on.  Much of what was accomplished was decent and made the lives of the people living there better.  If the Generals in Vietnam had made it policy to do more decent things for the people living there, then Vietnam might not have turned into the lost cause that it became.  I have talked to a few guys who worked in Special Forces during that time period.  They said that the missions they were doing early in the war were good ones.  These were the missions where they were working closely with the locals.  It wasn't until the conventional troops started being poured in that the whole situation degenerated into what it became.  Soldiers can't control what the politicians put them into.  They can only try to do the right thing in a tough situation.

This is not a movie to watch if you are looking for something that is trying to make a statement on the politics of Vietnam.  If you are looking for that, then go watch an Oliver Stone film.  Everything he makes is trying to make a political statement in one form or another.  If you are looking for a film that shows the reality of individuals trying to do the right thing and trying to make some kind of a difference regardless of the strategic level politics that are going on, then this is a much better film to watch.",1343001600,3,2449,4.515909090909091

811450,5,6304232764,"During the Vietnam War, a village that American forces are using to spy on the Ho Chi Minh Trail has its sacred elephant killed by the North Vietnamese Army because they were cooperating with the Americans. The villagers need an elephant for a ceremony that will occur within the week. Captain Sam Cahill, an easygoing man who is heading home, and his hotheaded replacement Captain TC Doyle scrounge up another elephant with the help of sneaky supply chief warrant officer David Poole, luckless farmboy Lawrence Farley, and short-timer Harvey Ashford, and transport it across South Vietnam to get it to the village on time, running into all sorts of transport problems, personality conflicts, and an NVA squad that wants the Americans out of the village. This is a cute little movie with Danny Glover excellent in the lead role, and excellent support provided by Ray Liotta, Denis Leary, and Doug E. Doug. Doug E. Doug who is excellent all around as a performer adds a certain spark to this movie that makes it very funny. This is a movie that is definitely worth seeing.",1266624000,7,1071,4.826086956521739

The soldiers vary in personality and motivation.  But they all come together to succeed in completing the mission.  The movie is drama & comedy with scenes of sweetness mixed in. I rate this movie quite ""Family Friendly"" with a few exceptions. Not for young children as there is some drinking (native alcohol rice drink that makes novices vomit), bathroom humour, and lying by our group of misfit soldiers. Violence is present but either off camera or slapstick (really, it IS an elephant, after all). These issues can be discussed by the parents.

It plays perfectly AND...it has subtitles for the Viet Cong scenes, contrary to the complaints from other reviewers.  I feel very fortunate.

I didn't expect BluRay quality, but in addition to lower res than I expected, the formatting is not adapted well for widescreen. So your options are to look at a horizontally stretched picture (which makes me crazy), or adjust the picture so the vertical is correct but cuts off a significant portion of the film (which also makes me crazy).
