8045955,5,B00078GLBM,"Very good comedy, I enjoyed watching it with my family! Even though it says Russian Soundtrack only, they practically don't talk in the movie, so it's not a problem if you don't understand Russian, the comedy is very interesting and you can understand what's going on. Almost like watching Charlie Chaplin.:-)",1265328000,,309,5.078431372549019
