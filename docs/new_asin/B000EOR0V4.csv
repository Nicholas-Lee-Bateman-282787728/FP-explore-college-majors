8111970,5,B000EOR0V4,"A Long Journey Home is Isabel Bayrakdarian's journey back to her homeland, she takes us on a journey to discover the history, the sights and culture of Armenia. I found this program fascinating and informative but I enjoyed her singing the most. Isabel Bayrakdarian has the voice of an angel and her melodies can lift your spirits, most audiences may know her from her contribution to the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Soundtrack, she provides the vocals for ""Evenstar"".

Aside from her wonderful singing, you learn a lot about Armenian history and see her personal connection to her hertiage and country,a simply delightful treat, I recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates history, different cultures and of course, very wonderful music.",1343174400,2,747,5.073170731707317
8111971,5,B000EOR0V4,"I enjoyed this videa so much. First, one gets a sense of Ms. Baldakdarian's enthusiastic personality and thought processes, and good footage of her lovely singing, mainly of armenian vocal compositions (Gomidas) recorded in various historic sites, accompanied with traditional armenian instruments. The main closing scene is of her performing a western operatic solo on stage with full orchestra. The DVD 'extras' give more of her performing both genres. Secondly, one gets some insight on the physical layout and cultural beauty and history of Armenia. Thirdly, the video is very professional and beautifully executed.",1306108800,2,619,5.595744680851064

8111973,5,B000EOR0V4,"A beautiful and compelling presentation by Soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian of Armenia; its ancient culture, its soul searching music, its spiritually haunting sacred sights and monuments, its majestic geography, and its checkered history throughout the ages.  Her interpretation of the various sacred and folk songs presented here, is profoundly disarming in its simplicity and purity of expression.  Her soprano voice is glorious and grand.  With a warm velvety timbre and a marvelous tessitura; it soars with ease and seemless fluidity thru all passaggios from the silver toned top, to the rich and full low notes.  A beautiful and important Artist.  And a first class presentation of an Ancient Land and her colorful and rich heritage.",1184630400,11,734,5.4035087719298245
8111974,4,B000EOR0V4,"This documentary offers a unique perspective on the Armenian experience.  Through the eyes, voice and heart of a highly accomplished classically trained Canadian soprano who is Armenian by heritage, the viewer gains insights into the history, culture and realities of today's Armenia.

This film will have enormous appeal to diasporan Armenians - those who dream of visiting the Republic of Armenia one day, and those who have already been to their ""homeland"" or even live there now.  If their eyes don't fill with tears at some point during the film, I'd be surprised.

For those of us who are NOT Armenian, this film offers lessons in history, geography, and the true essence of music and musicianship.  I don't doubt that many will be inspired by the movie and by Ms. Bayrakdarian to visit this ancient land someday soon.

Beautifully shot and recorded, gorgeous and moving to watch.",1148428800,21,886,4.993197278911564
