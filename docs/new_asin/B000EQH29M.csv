8113415,5,B000EQH29M,"I got this DVD beacuse as an plant ecologist from Virginia, it takes me back into the woods while winter snow is keeping me indoors. I also like it because of it's connection to a botanist/plant taxonomist I know, C. Ritchie Bell. I would only add another hour or two of trees and more flowers. Overall, it is one of the best winter excursions to remind of the summer woods!",1267488000,3,374,4.357142857142857
