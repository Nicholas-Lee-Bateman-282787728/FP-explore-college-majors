8541808,4,B009IDGJZ0,"This film is requirements for level 1. Good for getting ready for testing or for instructors to keep consistent with training. Yes, it is voice over but it is a foreign DVD, the group is European, and all the iprod videos I have are the same. The instruction is good and they do pack a lot on a DVD.",1439078400,,299,4.084745762711864

8541810,1,B009IDGJZ0,"I am new to Krav Maga and wanted a DVD to use at home, in order to supplement my twice weekly training. First of all, since I am a beginner I must say that from an accuracy of technique standpoint, I can in no way evaluate this DVD.  These instructors are apparently renowned for their expertise and they look to my novice eyes to be very capable.

My issue with the DVD is the poor production quality and the lack of actual instruction.  The DVD pauses frequently in mid-speech and the quality of the video itself is poor.  There is no in-depth instruction or accompanying drills to practice gaining proficiency of any particular maneuver.  It is one big ""demo"" of about 90 seconds per maneuver, showing the strikes, blocks, dodges etc.

I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase!!  I guess that's what I get for buying an ""unrated"" item!! LOL Which is why I am writing this review, in hopes of preventing someone else from repeating my mistake.  Walk in peace and get home safe.",1366329600,3,986,4.594285714285714
