2404989,4,B000B7QCGS,"Superman: The Animated Series Vol. 2 packs in another 18 episodes of the now-classic WB animated series. This series had a truncated run of only 54 episodes, and will be completed when vol. 3 is released in 2006.

There's a lot of a-list episodes in this set. The highlight is definitely the first meeting between Superman and Batman called ""World's Finest,"" previously available in a single disc edition called ""The Batman/Superman Movie."" Other notables include the first appearances of Dr. Fate and Steel, and also Superman villains Bizzaro and Mr. Mxyzptlk. There's a trip to a totalitarian alternate universe where Superman and Luthor have joined forces, and another episode where Clark Kent seemingly dies. Even look for an episode that ties directly into the 2nd season finale of Justice League Unlimited.

And yet there's some clunkers as well. Depending on your tastes the series often fell flat when it resorted to action-heavy episodes that shorted characterization and development. The Metallo episodes are pretty bland, as is a team-up with Parasite and Livewire. Luminus is a gimmicky villain in a generic spandex costume, and the episode with the giant monkey grows old fast. The set is also pretty light on the ongoing Darkseid plot, and his most notable appearances have been saved for vol. 3.

Nitpics aside, Superman: vol. 2 is another great set worth picking up for fans and those wanting to get something worthwhile for their children. They could've loaded the extra features with more commentaries, but that's WB for ya. Snap this set up and soar with the man of steel.",1126569600,10,1591,5.0418250950570345
2404990,5,B000B7QCGS,"QOUTE: ""In September 1996, the Warner Brothers television network began a new animated series: Superman with 13 episodes in the first season. It started as a 90-minute primetime movie special on September 6, 1996 showing the first 3 episodes. Tim Daly (Wings) voices Superman. Dana Delany (China Beach and Batman: Mask of Phantasm) is the voice of Lois Lane. Clancy Brown (Highlander) is Lex Luthor. Malcolm McDowell as Metallo. Michael York plays Kanto. Michael Ironside plays Darkseid. Gilbert Gottfried is Mr. Mxyzptlk. Bruce Timm and Paul Dini (from Batman: The Animated Series) worked on character designs and stories. Timm acted as Animator, while Dini and Alan Burnett (story editor for the Super Friends in 1985) joined Timm as Producers. There comic book Superman Adventures is based around the Animated Series. The television series is similar, but does not copy the continuity from the current regular Superman comics. In the first season episodes Lobo featured in a two part episode. Other episodes have Brainiac, Bizarro, Metallo, Dr. Fate, Batman, The Flash, Jax-Ur, Parasite, and the Toyman.""

REVIEW: SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES (1996-2000) is one of the many cartoons I used to watch on the weekdays after school. And while I didn't favor the show as much as Batman:TAS, I can't argue that this was undoubtedly one of the better series that potrayed the Superman mythos and characters. When the show was taken off the air (after the Batman/Superman adventures) It fell into the deep rescesses of my mind and was utterly forgotten. It was not until I stared watching a mishmash of episodes from the WB's Smallville's first season in late 2001 did I start remembering I used to watch Superman:TAS. I looked for information on the show, the only thing that was gvien was the generic BATMAN/SUPERMAN ADVENTURES description and several DVDs with the first episodes of the first season. So basically I was left in a rut. Later on I found out Superman man was being reaired on Boomerang. I started watching it again from the first episode and have been recording the episodes ever since. Superman continues its strong storyline with season two, with more of a grip for the SM characters and excellent action to boot.

Clark Kent faces more challenges as he squares off with new and returning villains (Jax-Ur, Mala, Metallo, Parasite, Livewire, to name a few) and a appearance by the other worldly Rumpelstikin type character Mr. Mxyzptlk ---who gets better treament here than he did on Smallville's S4 episode ""Jinx."" Superfriends villian, Darkseid reappears as well. Along the way he is aided by, though not intentionally, popular DC COMICS characters such as The Flash from ""The Justice League"" in the episode ""Speed Demons"", and Batman from ""The New Batman Adventures"" in the popular 3 part episode ""The Worlds Finest."" Aquaman also makes and appearance in either this season or the third. The animation and voice acting continues to be provided with excellence, the characters remain the same with a couple developments (although its hard to see this with a cartoon that's only 20/21 minutes at best without comericals). Tim Daly continues to voice a convincing Superman. Clancy Brown and Dana Delany are by far the best Lex Luthor, Lois Lane characterizations ever! While this particular series is being released much slower than ""BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES,"" (which in all honesty I believe was released to promote the ""Batman Begins"" movie) this shouldn't wane on anyone's excitement for those who have been waiting for either of these series to be released on DVD. The product description describes eighteen episodes on two disks and with some special features consisting of commentary for several of the episodes and a featurette for the villians of Superman. Release date, supposedly December 6TH 2005. [A 5 out of 5]",1126310400,9,3841,5.095238095238095

Mainly because they did a fantastic job dealing with Kirbys new gods. I loved Timms Darkseid! He brought a serious menace to an overall light hearted series. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mean light hearted as in childish. It's just Superman brings out hope in everybody, especially the viewer.",1474848000,,565,4.495145631067961

I like this set because its not as big and bulky as the Batman Animated Series, but the downfall to that of course is in order to put all the episodes in the set some of the discs are flip discs.  Personally I absolutely hate this because the chances of scratching your disc goes up.  Dont know why they decided to do this, because all of the Batman Animated sets are not like that, and so I am never concerned about damaging my discs.

On the other hand, it was predictable and not specially exciting, and I can't help but think of how awesome the 1990s Batman cartoons were when I watch these (which is disappointing because they were produced by almost exactly the same team of people).  I would half-heartedly recommend this show to people with kids over the age of 10 (the city of Metropolis believes in the death penalty, and there are a couple other disturbing deaths on top of the city-ordered one).",1459296000,,686,4.60655737704918

2405480,5,B000B7QCGS,"Good animation.  Fight scenes are not overlong, leaving ample time for character development.  For example, we learn that Lex Luthor's female bodyguard, who obviously loves him, was a street urchin he recruited and groomed, but when things get hairy, she risks her life for him, but he does nothing to help her when facing danger.  She knows this, shows a little anger, but then lapses back into obedience, like an abused spouse...

Of course part of developing characters we connect with is the voice acting, which is superb.

Many such tidbits, but, more importantly for extended viewing, fresh plots abound.'

Also, Superman isn't as omnipotent as in many of the Silver Age comics or other cartoons.

All in all, the best superhero cartoon series I've watched.",1446336000,,763,5.007936507936508

I'm currently re watching Superman with my two year old son, and it still holds up remarkably well.

2405690,5,B000B7QCGS,"There have been many animated series based on Superman, but to me this is the best. The storylines are very adult and modern and if you can overlook the cartoony animation the characterizations of each member of this series is spot on. Luthor is played as an businessman, but a ruthless businessman who would sell his mother for a profit. And the orhers, especially Superman are filled with raw human emotions....this is especially evident in the last season of the show where tears were wept for a fallen comrade who stood up to a major league badguy. The writing and voiceovers is well done. This is worth a viewing most certainly.",1428019200,,633,4.711711711711712

2405695,5,B000B7QCGS,"If you like SUPERMAN or just enjoy comic book story-lines these cartoons are superior entertainment. This series was a follow-up BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES, and this second season contains a three part cross-over story-arc called WORLD'S FINEST that has Bruce Wayne visiting Metropolis, with Lex Luther and the Joker teaming up to take down the two heroes. Additionally the second season includes such classic Superman story and character elements as the Phantom Zone, Braniac, Mr. Mxyxptilk, Jack Kirby's Apokolips (with Darkeid and others), Metallo, and Bizarro Superman just to name a few. We also get to see Superman race the Flash and the appearance of the Kong like Titano (a monkey sent into space that returns as a giant ape with a crush on Lois Lane).

You can watch superman grow from a baby on krypton to a leader of the justice league. There are some inconsistencies with his character. It's weird knowing he's almost fast as flash but still gets knocked my someone like lex. Strong enough to go toe to toe with darksied but still gets thrown by a robot. It makes superman look silly and wonder if he even knows what to do with all those powers of his. Besides that, it's still fun to watch.",1425081600,,550,4.298076923076923

2405725,5,B000B7QCGS,"This is a truly great series. The stories are intelligent and Superman is well-imagined. There are various nods to the 1978 film, most noticeably the music which strains not to sound like the Donner film's famous score (and still manages to evoke it).  I like the way that Clark Kent is more like the George Reeve portrayal from the 50s show. He's confident, not like the amusing, comical whiner approach that Christopher Reeves took.  This is not a criticism of Christopher Reeves, I'm just noticing that a confident Clark Kent changes the whole texture of the story. The result is a little more gritty, and Superman's daily struggle is a little more obvious.

It's hard to mention Superman without discussing the Batman animated series. The artwork, storytelling, and overall quality of Superman is comparable to Animated Batman. Superman isn't quite the gritty character Batman is, however, and in some ways that limits the kind of stories that can be told with the character. However, I think you could argue Superman's unique make-up sets up some highly philosophical situations. He's essentially a god on earth, and though he his all powerful, he is also tremendously limited to prevent certain tragedies. I'm sure that many of the stories in the Animated Series appeared in comic books. They were all new to me however (I never had access to many comic books). It's obvious that at the nucleus of this series is some intelligent storytellers polishing off some ideas that have been presented and perfected in many different forms throughout the years.  Highly recommended.",1424736000,,1579,5.038314176245211

Along with the animated Justice League volumes, this is a masterpiece in superhero action, storytelling, and animation.  Kudos to Warner Animation Studios, Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and the various writers and producers in bringing the DC characters and stories to wondrous life.

2405779,4,B000B7QCGS,"This is a good show for littler kids exploring good and evil; it borders on wholesome and that's becoming quite rare.  Gun-play is limited to lasers and super-powers, and nobody bleeds or dies.  There are some good back-story gems in here like the origin of Green Lantern, and of SuperGirl, and Clark's home and family back in Smallville.  There's even some overlap with Batman and Robin, but those episodes are more violent with scary music - too scary sometimes, especially before bed.  If Superman's voice acting were better, I'd give this five stars.  Too bad there aren't more clean shows like this.",1411171200,,604,4.882352941176471

2405781,4,B000B7QCGS,"Being barely over 25, my idea of animation is something like the Incredibles or Happy Feet.  My dad who is in his 50s talks about the days of Popeye, Mickey Mouse, etc. and Saturday morning cartoons  Anyway, my dad's sister has a 12 and 14 year old who was helping me out on a project when we took a break and I let them view a few shows on Prime Video.  As I was crashing on the couch to take a rest, I caught some of this Superman and it is really good.  The stories are nice and the animation is pretty good. The characters are nicely drawn and well defined.  I don't remember it back in the 1990s though I was around 7 or 8 so it may not have caught my eye.  Now I am enjoying watching Superman whenever the youngsters are over. Also we have now gotten both my aunt and my dad into watching and they like it too.",1410566400,,816,3.9754601226993866

Some of the episodes are extremely memorable and others not so much. There is a good variety of villians here too but maybe too much Brainiac? The Darkseid episodes are fantastic and ""World's Finest"" is nothing to sneeze at. It's a solid series. Virtually the same teams for everything as Batman TAS so the production value is awesome! I only wish there was more material. The Kids! WB thing was very finicky. I highly recommend the series if you've never seen it and enjoy Superman.",1407888000,,649,4.555555555555555

Like many of its predecessors it suffers a bit from lazy writing, instead of scaling stories around Superman as he is in continuity the writers simply depower the Man of Steel. I still love the series and highly recommend it to everyone.

I loved watching all three seasons of Superman the Animated Series, especially when special guest stars showed up, Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, even Aquaman. Who did I forget?

Of the recurring villains, I think Mxyzptlk was my favorite. Superman's tricks to get him back into the Fifth Dimension were different from what I remember in the comics.

If you enjoy Superman, try the Animated Series. You might love it, too.

Believe it or not, (and I have argued this with many a comic book geeks) but this trouble magnetism that Lois possesses assists Superman in saving people. Don't get me wrong, I love Superman, but I heart Lois Lane. Lo Lo is why this girl came to fall in love with superheroes in the first place.

Now, on to Superman or Clark, depending on attire & millosecond. He faces many classic opponents: Lex Luthor (of course), Brainiac, Bizzaro & his sweet puppy Krypto, Metallo, the annoying Toyman, the ultra-annoying kltpzyxm, kltpzyxm (kill tip zee zum), Granny Goodness & her fugly female furies, and Mr. Omega Beams, himself, Lord Darkseid. Supes also gets a little help from a few Superfriends like brooding Batman Bruce Wayne, supercute Supergirl, Arthur Fish Curry Aquaman, & the fastest man alive Flash.

Superman, on the other hand, uses pure brute strength to defeat his villains. Most of the episodes feature flavor of the week villains. Since Superman's only weakness is kryptonite, there's no real suspense since you know Superman's going to win. Batman, on the other hand, comes up with creative ways to defeat his villains. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the crossover episodes with Batman and the Darkseid episode, since Superman finally fought someone who was on his level.

2405911,5,B000B7QCGS,"Although you still have plenty of sci-fi stories and sci-villains in the episodes, it seems the creators of the show are starting to figure it out - the more realistic, the better. Superman is finally starting to battle more than sci-fi villains now. He's also battling local crime on Earth. And they're starting to set the stories more at night now. For most of Volume One, almost all of the stories took place in the day time. Now there's some night in the show too. Plus the episodes are evolving the charaters now as well. Volume One was mostly plot based, but Volume Two is just as much about the charaters as it is about the plots. And the plots are even getting better too. Brovo for Volume Two.

Highly recommended!

2405912,4,B000B7QCGS,"I am a Christian and I really like Superman, but I had a few issues with some of the episodes in this set. PARENTS BE WARNED THERE IS SOME HARRY POTTERESQUE ELEMENTS IN ONE OF THE EPISODES AND SOME SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE MATERIAL IN OTHERS! Overall most of the episodes were excellent there were just a few that I thought were inappropriate. Here is an episode by episode break down.

Disc 1:
Identity Crisis - This is a very entertaining episode. It deals with the origin of one of Superman's troublesome acquaintances. This one gets an 8 out of 10.

Target - This is also quite a good one. As with all the episodes Lois wears too short a skirt, but other than that it is good. I give this one an 8 out of 10.

Action Figures - This one is about average. My main complaint with episode is where Superman is exposed to Kryptonite, but has a enough strength to grab the Kryptonite and throw it far from himself. To me this is inconsistent, because I was under the impression that Kryptonite was so incapacitating to him that he could not function much at all when exposed to it. I give this one a 6 out of 10.

Mxyzpixilated - This is one of the ones I have a problem with. The practically omnipotent character Mxyzilplic lives in the 5th dimension and when Superman sends him back there, over and over, he has a girlfriend there waiting for him. Well this girlfriend is so oozing with sexual energy that this episode should be practically R-rated. There is one scene where Mxyzilplic is working on an invention to kill Superman so diligently that she is trying to get his attention by appearing in one sexy outfit after another, with equally sexy poses, in order to tempt him away from his work. It's kind of on the edge for kids. I give it a 6 out of 10.

Double Dose - This is one of the main ones I have a problem with. The character named Live Wire is lewd and crass. This episode has many sexual innuendos and inappropriate references. At one point Superman found that he could withstand his enemies attacks by wearing some kind of clear covering over himself. Live Wire responds by saying that ""the boyscout in blue brought protection."" Granted some of these references kids might not catch on to, but kids are smarter than we give them credit for and they find things out. This one is not for kids in my book and I give it a 3 out of 10.

Solar Power - This one is about average. Not bad, but not excellent. I give it a 5 out of 10.

Disc 2, Side A:

Monkey Fun - This one is appropriately named; it's a lot fun. Imagine Superman vs. King Kong, but with a humorous twist.  I give this one an 8 out of 10.

Brave New Metropolis - This one is a good, but I have to deduct some points from it for lack of realism. In one scene Lois is trying to escape the police by climbing up a statue. She does a great impression of Spiderman. Who needs Superman ehh? I give this one a 7 out of 10 points.

Ghost in the Machine - This one is good, slightly better than average. I give it a 7 out of 10 points.
World's Finest: Part 1, 2, and 3 - This is one is aptly named. I love watching the two big names meet up. Superman and Batman working together. It gives me goose bumps. I give this 10 out of 10.

Disc 2, Side B:

Father's Day - This one is good. I find a little fault with it because for half the episode Superman's dad is in a building about to collapse while Superman is fighting a bad guy. That building was about to collapse for quite a long time. It is still an interesting episode. I give this one 8 out of 10.

The Hand of Fate - This is another one I have serious problems with. This is too occult for kids. It deals with witchcraft and of course rather than turning to God to deal with the demonic they use more witchcraft to counter the demonic. Not for kids in my book. I give this one a 1 out of 10.

Bizarro's World - This one is quite funny. I give it an 8 out of 10.

Prototype - This one is very good. Superman vs. Robocop, well sort of. I give it a 9 out of 10.

The Late Mr. Kent - This one is excellent. The only problem I have is that Superman seemed to be too bothered when shot with bullets in this one. It is still great though. I give it 10 out of 10.

Heavy Metal - This is one is quite awesome. Of course it skirts the realm of believability, but still great. I give it a 10 out of 10.",1288051200,2,4308,4.090154211150653
2405913,4,B000B7QCGS,"The exciting stories of Superman (voiced by same actor across the major animated DC series --- love the consistency) told with great art, stories, and voice actors.  I actually rather liked Lois in this one (most times I just think how Superman deserves someone better.)",1287619200,,270,5.0
2405914,5,B000B7QCGS,"""Superman the Animated Series"" Season 2 is yet another animated hit by the team that brought us ""Batman the Animated Series"" and ""Tiny Toon Adventures"". These animated shows were targeted primarily at children, but contained enough intelligent drama and comedy for adults to enjoy as well.

  In addition to introducing such recurring villains as Bizarro Superman and Mister Mxyzptlk (pronounced Mix-yes-spit-lick), this season of Superman the Animated series includes a multi-episode crossover arc with the writers and voiceactors of ""the Batman Animated Series"" called ""World's Finest"". The plot of this 3-parter will have any Batman/Superman fan aching to see it: Lex Luthor teams up with the Joker (voiced by legend Mark Hamill) to kill Superman. Sensing that Joker's up to something, Batman (the one and only Kevin Conroy) follows him to Metropolis where he teams up with the man of steel to keep Luthor and Joker from making Metropolis their own criminal playpen. Without giving anything away, this 3-part arc contains some of the best moments in the series, not to mention a much-welcome encore performance by the voices of the Batman Animated Series, which had been off the air for a while when these episodes were made.

  The other episode that really stood out for me was ""Brave New Metropolis"", in which Lois accidentally travels to another dimension (using Phantom Zone Technology) in which Superman has become fascist and evil, teaming up with Lex Luthor to police the citizens of Metropolis out of their freedoms. Much darker than the rest of the season, this episode shows a Superman that has been shaped by pain and tragedy into a numb, uncaring juggernaut. Luckily, Lois sees the good in this dark, broken Superman and guides him back to the good path. This episode contains the death of Lex Luthor (only in the alternate universe), one of the few explicit deaths to occur in the show. ""Brave New Metropolis"" also contains the first Lois/Superman kiss of the series, though it is with Alternate Dimension Superman as opposed to the ""real"" man of steel.

  If you liked season one of ""Superman the Animated Series"", there's no reason not to check out season two. It's more of the same consistently high-quality animation that was spawned in a generation of lame attempts and dismal failures. This season will be especially enjoyed by fans of the Christopher Reeve Superman films, ""Batman the Animated Series"", ""Powerpuff Girls"" (which often parodies Superman) and ""Smallville"" (a reimagining of Clark Kent's youth).",1257724800,,2532,5.12621359223301
2405915,4,B000B7QCGS,Excellent series all the way through. You get to learn Mxyzpltk is actually pronounced :Mix-L-Spit-Lik: and other fine things about the man of steel. This includes the Superman and Batman crossover which runs through 3 episodes.,1250121600,,228,5.361111111111111
2405916,4,B000B7QCGS,"I watched the animated BATMAN with my daughter when she was a small child, when it was coming out for the first time.  I recently watched the Justice League cartoons that were done by largely the same people.  I should have watched SUPERMAN before watching JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, and so should you if you haven't seen them all yet.  SUPERMAN, like BATMAN, is not at all a bad show.  It is, in fact, a very decent one.  The problem is that the Justice League shows are extraordinary and they make all of the others look weak in comparison.  On the other hand, watching SUPERMAN after JUSTICE LEAGUE really brings how brilliant the latter truly was and how much both the writing and the animation techniques improved as they worked on it.

Still, SUPERMAN is all in all a pretty decent cartoon series.  While the writing isn't nearly as strong or as innovative as the writing on JUSTICE LEAGUE would be, it was still quite above normal for children's programming and the voice talent, like all of the DC cartoon shows, is top notch.  It is all quite watchable, but I never, ever got the sense that I was watching something remarkable as I did with JL.

I also did not care much for the general ""dumbbing down"" of the DC stories.  And some of the revisions of traditional DC storylines were unnecessary and arbitrary.  For instance, they do a Green Lantern origins episode in Season Three, several traditional elements are changed.  Abin Sur is shown as having been pursued by Sinestro, whereas in most origins stories Abin Sur is deeply upset at the death of his colleague.  And Sinestro is shown already a fully blown bad guy upon the selection of the earthling Green Lantern for Section 2814.  The successor of Abin Sur is in this version Kyle Raynor, while there is a bizarre nod to the original Green Lantern, Hal Jordan in the episode.  Why Kyle Raynor instead of Hal Jordan?  Perhaps because Jordan's back story as a test pilot is too well established, while it was easier to work with Raynor?  It was all just odd and I'm confused at nearly all of the narrative choices in this particular episode.  But the same kind of oddness afflicts several episodes.  Not to beat too often on the same drum, but these kinds of changes were much better handled in the later JL series.

I don't recommend skipping this episode, but I definitely recommend watching the three DC series in the order that they were made, BATMAN, then SUPERMAN, and then JUSTICE LEAGUE.  While the first two series are of a similar quality, the third grew into something truly special.",1249603200,,2577,4.642384105960265

2405919,3,B000B7QCGS,"The episodes in this volume are top-notch.  Unfortunately, Warner Brothers Video went the cheap route (again) and Disc 2 and Disc 3 are on opposite sides of the same disc.  This may or may not have been the reason, but after the first play of Disc 3, it would no longer play (or even be recognized) on any of my DVD drives (a Panasonic DVD-R, a Panasonic DVD Player, a Toshiba DVD-R PC drive, a Panasonic DVD-R PC drive and an external Panasonic DVD-RAM PC drive (which normally plays DVDs just fine)).  There's no visible damage to the DVD surface.  It just won't play.

I wrote WB Customer Service and eventually got a response saying my e-mail had been forwarded to corporate, but I have not heard anything after that.

I'm well past my return window for returning to Amazon without paying postage plus a 15% restocking fee, so unless Warner Brothers corporate eventually gets back to me, I guess I'll just have to shell out the bucks to get a replacement set.

Update: Warner Brothers Video sent me a pre-paid postage label, so I sent it back, and they quickly turned around and sent me a new set that worked just fine.  I'm very impressed with their customer service.",1228780800,6,1172,4.5476190476190474

In this second set of episodes, we learn much more about Superman, along with his various friends and enemies. Most entertaining and interesting is the introduction of Mr. Mxyzptlk in ""MXYZPIXILATED"" and the Joker (usually a Batman villain) to the series in ""WORLD'S FINEST"". This series still, even though it has long since been cancelled off the air (except for syndication), proves to be a great homage to the Superman universe, and to comic books in general. It is an excellent example of outstanding ideas, insight, animation, action, a bit of romance, and suspense.  Below is a list of episodes contained in this two-disc set.

2405933,4,B000B7QCGS,"Well for anyone who enjoyed this series back in the 90's this is a must have. And if you really like Superman this is a must, must have! I grew up watching this show and since I am a huge fan of Superman once I had a good job and therefore money, I decided to get this series on DVD and I sure wasn't dissapointed. This Volume introduces some great villains and is full of awesome episodes with some interesting bonus material as well.",1173312000,,435,4.190476190476191
2405934,4,B000B7QCGS,"There are a number of criticisms of the Man of Steel, most notably that he's so powerful there can be little suspense in his battles.  Therefore, there are really only 2 types of battles in the Superman universe - those with villians as powerful as he, and those involving kryptonite (his Achillies Heel).  The producers of the Superman: the Animated Series know this, and wisely introduce a number of innovations in order to keep the stories fresh.

The most important, from a storytelling perspective, is that the stories often centre on Lois Lane instead of Superman.  This also allows the writers to give the Clark Kent personna lots of screen time, as a sidekick to Lois.  The two best episodes of this season are examples of this:  In ""Brave New Metropolis,"" Lois is teleported to an alternate universe where Superman is a vaguely fascist policeman (the S on his suit is a stylised Nazi-SS lightning bolt) in Lex Luthor's dictatorship of Metropolis.  The best episode of the series is called ""The Late Mr. Kent,"" wherein Clark is hot on the tail of a sensitive story that results in a car bomb being detonated under him.  Of course, Clark as Superman is unhurt, but Clark the human could never have survive the blast.  This leads to the very entertaining and interesting storyline of Superman trying to figure out how to bring Clark back to life.  (In the best scene in the season, the police are baffled that Clark's mom doesn't seem concerned that her son has just been killed.  ""Ma'am, are you sure you understand the implications of what I've just told you?"")

Of course, there are also some knock-down, drag-out fights with some of Superman's arch enemies.  Here, though, the series is not at its finest, although it's through no fault of its own.  Superman simply doesn't have the cast of villians of, say, Batman.  Even the most casual fan would be able to name several Batman villians (e.g., Joker, Riddler, Penguin, Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Freeze).  After Lex Luthor and Mr. Mxyzptlk (the latter of whom is a one-trick pony), there are no real first-line villians in Superman's pantheon.  This show did introduce a new villain named Livewire (with a high-octane voice by Lori Petty), and this season does feature Darkseid in one episode and Brainiac in another.  But, as expected, the vast number of shows are variations of some Lex scheme to destroy Superman, or take over the world, or whatever.

The highlight for many (and the reason I bought this disc) will be the 3-episode crossover with the Batman universe titled, appropriately, ""World's Finest.""  Joker finds a large piece of kryptonite and offers to kill Superman for Lex Luthor.  The friction common between Batman and Superman is evident, this time brought on by the neat twist of ahving Bruce Wayne date Lois Lane.  Overall, it might be the most enjoyable multi-part story in all of the Superman/Batman animated series.",1169942400,3,2914,4.8562753036437245
2405935,5,B000B7QCGS,"Further proof of my shame of not viewing this series when it was originally on air, Volume 2 features some of my favorite episodes. It features the three parter which really turned me on to the series and that was ""World's Finest"" which was (if memory serves me correct) was Batman's first appearance since his original series run ended around 1995. Around this time, they were making the re-vamp eppys of Bats but they didn't premiere until 1997 I believe.

Anyway, here is what's cookin' on Volume 2:

Disc 1

Identity Crisis - Bizzaro, the reverse Superman, is re-introduced here as a failed clone experiment gone ary by none other than Lex Luthor.

Double Dose - Freed from prison, Livewire wants revenge on Superman and enlists The Parasite to do it but will her lust for vengence blind her to a bigger danger?

Such characters include: Luminus, Karkull, Bizarro, and Darkseid (Darkseid made a small cameo in Volume 1, but this is his true first episode). In three of these great episodes, Barman and Superman must team-up in order to defeat Lex Luther and The Joker who are working together to destroy The Man of Steel! Also.....Superman meets his clone, Metallo returns with amnesia, someone is trying to secretly kill Lois Lane (but who?), Braniac downloads himself into Lex Luthor's computer, Parasite and Livewire team-up, Clark Kent is thought to be dead, Lois Lane gets stuck in an alternate version of Metropolis, and Superman must battle a really big monkey!

This volume is very exciting and action-packed. With very, very, very good plots and story lines - this is even better than the comics! While, this is a children's show, I can asure you that it will NOT be ONLY accepted and loved by children. This is true entertainment and adults enjoy it, too. You don't find good shows like these anymore, so I recommend you to start the Timm/Dini animated DC universe collection on DVD box-sets! Even if you're not a Superman fan, if you liked 1992's ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" (and even if you didn't) you'll definetely love this. ""Superman: The Animated Series"" rocks!!! Buy this for a new generation of children, because it's worth it!",1150416000,2,2876,4.944099378881988
2405937,5,B000B7QCGS,"In this one we get to see Darkseid (Dark Side) and Dr. Fate and the Flash. It's a preview of what we see in the Justice League.  Too bad I can't afford them all!  If you are a fan of the original 1940's Superman cartoons with the art deco atmophere, then these are for you.  I really like how the characters are modernized for a new generation of fans. It's hard to believe these were made 10 years ago!

On to the quality.  The sound and color is very vibrant.  This is coming from someone who watches them on a small color set with no stereo. I can imagine how they sound on home theater.  This set has all the classical images that make Superman the more colorful hero...as opposed to Batman, who I still admire but is on the dark side....",1145750400,3,742,4.183098591549296
2405938,5,B000B7QCGS,"In this second set of episodes from the hit series, there are several highlights that are worth discussing.  This set includes the unforgetable three part many series, World's Finest, in which Batman and Superman team up for the first time.  The planet Apocalypse is also revisited, and fans get a better look at Darkseid, lord of Apocalypse and his heir.  Bonus features also include a look at the villians of Superman.  If you've purchused the first volume, don't stop there.  Buy this one!  And don't forget, the third and final volume of this series will be released on June 20th.  Don't even get me started on how awesome that one is!",1145059200,,639,4.702702702702703
2405939,4,B000B7QCGS,"We all have to admit that Superman has a tough act to follow on gaining popularity like Batman. lets face it, with a hero who is near invurnable, its difficult to make an interesting story about him because you would know that in the end he will always win, unscathed, with no scars or affecting injuries.

And its surprising that they managed to solve that problem in the animated series. by down powering superman, they have managed to make him into a more interesting character, who uses his brain as well as his brawn. and they have made for him more interesting villians in the series than he has in the comics. amongst the highlights of his villians there are Lex Luthor ( goes without saying), Brainac, which is totally different from what we know from the comics, Metallo, Live wire, Parasite and Toyman.

Even though this series hasn't been as popular as the batman, or Justice leagues one's, i say give the big blue guy a chance. Animation still looks good nowadays compared to others, stories are well told and paced out and never boring ( one of the highlights is an episode where superman runs an alternate universe dictatorship regime future with lex luthor. way cool!!).

Also for the price it is quite good, including some nice extras, features and commentaries. i hope they won't take too long to release volume 3!!",1142985600,,1332,4.683760683760684
2405940,4,B000B7QCGS,"Some characters never lose their charm, no matter how similar all their adventures may become over time. Superman is one such hero, whose sheer presence forces us to go through the metallo-induced yawns and bizarro-related sighs. I can only wait for more of Darkseid. Also, the ""brave-new metropolis"" theme could have been expanded in other episodes too. But more importantly, Bruce Wayne was always gentle towards even the merest mortals (remember ""The Terrible Trio""?), how could the ""World's Finest"" episode depict him so badly and get away with it?",1141862400,,552,5.213483146067416
2405951,4,B000B7QCGS,"Enjoyable stories continuing the Superman animated series.

Great DC characters guest star. Watch out for the Flash racing Superman in ""Speed Demons,"" Dr Fate in ""The Hand of Fate,"" and see John Henry Irons' development into the Steel character in ""Prototype"" and ""Heavy Metal"".

Luthor and Brainiac plotlines continue to develop, and we see more of Darkseid, and get our first encounter with Kalibak and Desaad. Also of note is the three part ""Worlds Finest"" story, featuring Kevin Conroy and the regular Batman cast reprising their voice roles, as the Dark Knight meets the Man of Steel, in a pairing which is initially antagonistic, and then develops into the friendship we see between them in Justice League episodes today.

Your appetite will be fully whetted in the hopes of seeing lots more of the same when/if they release season 3.",1141776000,,840,4.985714285714286

This volume does contain the three parter 'World's Finest' though, (pre-released as 'The Batman-Superman movie') which is among the best either series has to offer. Bonus Features are thin on the ground, unfortunately, but this boxset remains a great release. The animated menus are beautifully done, the vocal talent are superb (especially Dana Delaney as Lois Lane and Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor) and the series' opening credits are a work of art.

There is no way to protect one side or the other. I just ""repaired"" side B, and hopefully it will work again. Of course, my oldests favorite episode was the one that was scratched & damaged. I think they could have splurged a little on the cost and given us 3 DVDs.",1140652800,2,427,4.035294117647059
2405955,5,B000B7QCGS,"Don't get me wrong, I love the series but once again they only issued two discs for a three disc set, because the one disc has a picture on it and the other is a double sided disc. When you hold the Superman series next to the Batman series, there is such a big difference. The Batman series opens up into four discs, each one with a picture on it. With Superman, you get one picture disc, and the other is blank. They did this with the first set too. I can't understand why they would take the cheap way out. Charge a couple more dollars if you have to, and do the job right the first time. Regardless, I'm waiting to complete the set. The episodes with Darkseid are my favorites.",1135814400,5,681,4.166666666666667
2405956,5,B000B7QCGS,"(Edited on 12/28/05 to add information on the Special Features.)

I love these series. I watched more Batman Animated than Superman when these were on TV, but I find I enjoy this the same, if not more than, the Batman series.

The storylines are well done and realistic most of the time. I like how characters and villains are interwoven throughout the episodes, so that there is a continuity that makes it all the more believable. Also enjoyable is the way Lois and Superman's relationship is developing. The constant teasing reminds me of the Lois and Clark TV series, which I also love.

The highlight of this volume is of course the World's Finest episodes, a three-episode arc that brings Batman in Metropolis to stop The Joker from killing Superman. Seeing the two superheroes sharing the screen is such a treat, especially if you like both characters. And The Joker is simply delightfully badass here.

Kudos to the voice acting too, it's just amazing. I could recognise all characters by voice with my eyes closed.

If you are a fan of the Batman Animated Series, but never watched this show, get it. If you have watched and liked this show, and are wondering whether it is worth buying the DVDs, get it. The commentaries available on key episodes are enjoyable and informative. Besides the commentaries, this volume includes a short feature on the Superman villains. I was also treated to a small litho print of Superman and Lois when I opened the package. From package to content, this is one of the best additions to my DVD library.

If you like comics, animation, and well thought-out storylines, or any of the above, pick this up. I can't wait for the next volume.",1135641600,5,1677,4.726027397260274
2405957,4,B000B7QCGS,"People have complained about ""missing episodes"" - don't worry, there are actually 18 more in the series which, based on the episode list of 18 in this volume, means we're looking at a volume 3 in the near future. Chronologically, this volume is right on track and the others will inevitably come.

Superman and Batman are such different characters, it's hard to ""compare"" the series as many reviewers simply prefer the Batman character, so they naturally like the Bat eps better. I do think some of Timm and Dini's most thoughtful work overall was on early episodes of the Batman animated series, but they've still given us the best version of Superman to hit the screen since Richard Donner made us believe a man can fly.",1134864000,17,722,4.73015873015873
2405958,5,B000B7QCGS,"I was a huge fan of this series back when I was a kid. So being able to get the second set of this amazing series is just great! Reliving the episodes while seeing them in a whole new light is just a fantastic experience. But this set isn't only for the nostalgia. There is so much in this series that your average animated series these days doesn't have. For example the animation is fluid and amazing! One thing to mention is that it was animated by a Japanese studio, and yet it doesn't look like anime style at all. The backgrounds are much better than your average anime, and the storylines, of course, are for American audiences.

A main reason to buy this series is that the whole family will love it. These episodes can be enjoyed by kids from 7 years of age (and will be a welcome change from the crap they usually see on TV) all the way up to 60 year olds (believe me, my dad is 65 and he loves these episodes). Not only will these be enjoyed by all ages, but they're great for animation buffs too. These episodes were animated with cell paint and drawings. Yet they look just as good, if not better, than any digitally-aided series today.

And the voice acting! It's no secret that most animated series are voiced by the inexperienced. But this series brought in a load of acclaimed actors as well as many experienced voice actors. You'll never see a problem with any of the voice acting in this series.

The commentaries are fun to listen to. The episodes are great and imagninative, and the animation is exceptional. Watch and love this series. Now all I'm waiting for is for Batman Beyond and the Justice League to be released on DVD.",1134777600,6,1648,4.39672131147541
2405959,5,B000B7QCGS,"As I said in my review for volume one of this series, I think Superman's cool, and I think this animated series is cool.  The second volume introduces a few new baddies into Superman's universe, among them Metallo, Bizarro, and of course, my personal favorite, Mr. Myxyespitlik (forgive me if I mispell that).  The extradimensional elf makes his first appearance in a great and funny episode.  But there's still plenty of action in this set.

It's also got the three part story ""World's Finest"" where Batman of Batman: TAS and Superman of Superman: TAS meet for the first time, one of my all time favorite superhero movies.  And yes, that includes those big budget Hollywood blockbusters.

Why?  Writing.  It's all in the writing, and S: TAS has it in spades.  Great stories, cool characters, and eye-catching animation.

Now if they'd only release Justice League Season One on DVD.  Oh well, at least I get to enjoy this set while I wait.",1134777600,,939,4.770186335403727
2405960,3,B000B7QCGS,"I'm surprised no one else mentioned but one person that these are not all of the episodes from the series.  They are leaving out two of the best ""mini-series"" from the show.  Someone else mentioned the Apokolips three-parter, and they also left off the ""ending of the show"" ""LEGACY""?  Those were some of the best episodes, why are they not on any of the Superman:animated series boxsets???  Will they release them later, or are they just LOST FOREVER???  That's what I don't understand, I was finally looking forward to seeing those on dvd.  That's the only reason I give this set 3 stars, not 5.  Its not COMPLETED.  WB has done a poor job of marketing BTAS, AND S:AS.  If anyone has information on this write an updated review.",1134691200,2,729,4.589147286821706
2405961,3,B000B7QCGS,"Volume Two of Superman: TAS is a pretty good set though it tends to fall into the same cases of lack of plot, reliance on fights and overall lack of character development.

Again, Superman: TAS can best be summed up by the following two things: Laser Beams and Fighting! Though probably fun & exciting for a 6 year old, those of us in our twenties crave more story development.

Stand out shows include: The Late Mr. Kent (which has a rather breath taking finale), Brave New Metropolis and Father's Day. The rest however generate a sense of ""been there, done that.""

Parasite turning on Live Wire..what a tired plot device that is. Inclusion of World's Finest (a prior release), serves only to take up space. Etc etc etc... The villians suffer from not having strong enough development. Though I must say the introductory episode of Darkseid is amazingly great!

Darkseid is given a huge build up complete with menacing theme music, the Omega Beams! and even the Stargates he uses to travel between worlds! Very exciting!!!

What shame that the producers of the vastly superior Batman: TAS abandoned their vision to essentially copy the Superman show, thus pushing it to be cancelled.",1134259200,2,1184,4.841584158415841
2405962,5,B000B7QCGS,"While this may not be the best compilation of episodes from this marvelous series, a product of years of perfecting the incomparable Batman the Animated Series, and even though the best is yet to come [and babe won't it be fine] in the last set as such wonderful climaxes in storytelling such as Apokolips Now! and Legacy are released, this set represents as a whole one of the best single television series ever to grace the small screen. Most each and every episode is so self-inclusive of itself from the group  It is marvelous how one of the more shunned foms of medium, the comic books, have become the vehicle for some of the greatest storytelling of all time, and even more a shame they have not received the public attention they deserve, simply because they are animated. In ""studying"" [watching mindlessly, hehe] hours upon hours of the DC animated series, and paying special attention to such details as the music, and the synchronization between the action on screen and the music cues, there are no finer shows that pay attention to the full scale of controls in storytelling than these animated gems. While true, some of them are strictly for the sci-fi among us, and while I have an innane scorn for things done strictly for the sake of telling whacked-out stories with characters who can take it, in most if not all instances of the Superman Animated series, they are so humanized by the limitations placed upon the protagonist that there is always a level of inherent relation between the audience and the most powerful being in the DC universe. In the later series, such as JLU, when Superman has matured in strength and intellect, he seems less and less this naive farm boy, and all that remains is the firm fertile ground of Kansas in which  his morals are planted, the true strenght behind Superman being his motives. I like to think of these series as the ""pueberty"" years of Superman's superhero career. He is still assimilating both defeats and victories into the hero he will one day become. The great part about this is that he can still be threatened by very real world situations, and these represent the best forms of writing; not catering a story to a superhuman character, but conforming that character to a situation that tests more than what makes him superhuman, but what makes him human, and exempliary in all those aspects. ""The Late Mr. Kent"" represents this best. If all stories could've been THIS well planned, and theatrical, the series would've been the best television show ever to be created. Yet, then again, that single episode wouldn't stand out. I will not divulge too much, and simply implore you to see it for yourself, but the collaboration of innovative storytelling and music in a real world situation in which the variable is not some mutant villain, but the Boy Blue himself, and put into a situation that is beyond his superhuman strengths to correct, in which he is reduced to the same confines as a normal human being, proves to the watcher that he truly is a superhero without his strengths and powers. THIS is Superman, the way he deserves to be represented, as the icon of strength and power towards good will. Of course, there is struggle on this path, even for one so powerful, but the eventual outcome, even if by the intervention of good friends, is always the toppling of evil.

P.S. I am wishing to start a petition online to support the release of ALL the scores concerning Batman and Superman animated series, and all related titles [including orchestrations of the synthesized scores to Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited, both chock full of great musical ideas bound by a slim budget to being synthesizers]. This music is some of the most incredible music ever composed, with Shirley Walker being the new queen of leitmotif [move over Johnny] and being both incredibly effective in and of itself, and complementing the cues on screen. No finer film and television music has been composed.",1134259200,3,3968,4.78134110787172

More powerful than a locomotive! You know the rest. The lone survivor from the doomed planet Krypton develops superhuman abilities on Earth and grows to be the world's strongest superhero. In this collection of action-packed episodes, Superman continues to protect Metropolis from such dangerous super villains like criminal mastermind Lex Luthor, the cruel warlord Darkseid, the troublesome prankster Mxyzptlk and the deadly cyborg Metallo. ""Superman: TAS"" is another excellent comic book adaptation from the creators of the award-winning ""Batman: TAS"".

The episodes collected here include the 3-part ""World's Finest"" arc (which is also included on the upcoming Batman animated series Vol. 4 DVD set) in which we see the first cross-over event with Superman and Batman as they take on the Joker and Luthor.  Also featured here are the first animated appearences of allies Dr. Fate and Steel, and Supes faces off against Bizzaro, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Metallo, Darkseid (voiced by Michael Ironside), and others as well, including a smashing episode where Lois finds herself in an alternate and dark future where Luthor and Superman teamed together to form a totalitarian world.  While many of the episodes here are more or less aimed towards a younger audience, the strikingly mature ""The Late Mr. Kent"" finds Superman faking the death of his reporter alter-ego to find a killer, with the end results being a bit of a shock.

Also, I am REALLY glad I never caved in and purchased the commodity ""Batman Superman Movie"", as the World's Finest episodes are included here.
