Shown in the original TV broadcast aspect ratio of 4:3, the DVD picture, though not ideal, is clean and sharp and should satisfy most viewers.  Colors look a bit warm, and seem to indicate an old video master was used for the DVD transfer.  (Colors look off when a print was made with less-capable, older equipments, thus usually indicating old prints.)  Indeed, Warner Archive's website (wbshop dot com) claims that this title has not been restored nor remastered.  Warner's site has a sample clip of the film that shows its picture quality.  My video clip at the top of this review also has a sample clip.  The mono audio track sounds fine.

One of a whole slew of TV movies made in the 90s about psychotic young people (including the 1992 standout ""Child of Rage""), ""A Killer Among Friends"" is about a disturbed teenaged girl who kills her best friend due to jealousy and attempts to cover it up by moving into her victim's home and interfering with the ensuing police investigation.  These shows are largely harmless, but they often turn serious topics about troubled young people into shallow dramas with cheap thrills, however well-intentioned the filmmakers and earnest the actors' performances are.  In the post-Columbine era, especially, I'm sure many viewers would want more from these topics.  Those who don't could find movies like this on the Lifetime movie channel nowadays.  Postscript: the real-life killers of the events depicted in ""A Killer Among Friends"" were just released from prison the past December.  I've read that new TV shows were in the works about the events, but haven't seen any yet.",1362355200,14,2195,5.93015873015873

5582117,4,B00BDZV8ZM,"I seen this when it was first shown back in 1992 on tv
Looking back it's a rough film (Even for a tv film it's super dark and depressing)
It's also one of those templates that would help create the Lifetime channel

Based off a real case of a murdered victim and the two girls that got away with it
It's a shocking story that seems to bizarre to really happen but, it did (Even though the movie was changed up with names, and various facts)
For a tv movie it's really HQ

Patty Duke  (plays the mother Jean Monroe)  of the murdered teenage girl and she delivers
her performance is heartbreaking and a bit hard to watch (very organic and real)

Loretta Swit  (plays Det. Patricia Staley) great casting choice Loretta also brings a realism to this movie

Margaret Welsh  (Ellen Holloway) good performance
Angie Rae McKinney  (Carla Lewis)  good performance
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen  (Jenny Monroe  (maybe has 15 minutes of screen time) but, she delivers big time!

It's a really dark and sad film mostly cause this really happened but, it's worth checking out at least once
But, don't expect to revisit it a lot  8.8/10
There's a documentary being made regarding the real Michele Avila murder case by her family  more tragedy oh joy!",1451952000,,1229,4.625
5582118,3,B00BDZV8ZM,"(1992) Starring Patty Duke, Tiffani-Amber Theissen, Loretta Swit, and Margaret Welsh; Directed by Charles Robert Carner
Running time: 96 minutes

This made-for-TV movie was based on the real-life 1985 murder of 17-year old Michele ""Missy"" Avila.  Pretty Tiffani-Amber Theissen plays Missy (here re-named Jenny).  Margaret Welsh is Jenny's best friend Ellen who moves in with Jenny's mother Jean (Patty Duke), supposedly to help Jean with the murder investigation.  In reality, Ellen is the one who killed Jenny in a jealous rage, and helping the girl's mother is actually the last thing on her mind.  She wants to take over the life Jenny had, including the relationship with Jenny's family.  The story skips along too fast, not giving the viewer the chance to get to know the characters that well, except for Jean and Ellen.  Theissen is sweet and likable in her brief role as Jenny, and Loretta Swit is really good as a police detective, but Welsh over-acts, and Duke is borderline annoying (not good, since the viewer is expected to sympathize with her).  This movie leaves the viewer with the feeling that there should have been more to it.  Mildly entertaining to watch once, but you probably won't want to view it more than that.",1449187200,2,1235,4.956310679611651
5582119,3,B00BDZV8ZM,I remember watching this movie a ton of times in the 90's and I used to love it but back then I think I loved every movie that aired on Lifetime. During a rewatch recently I realized that in all fairness it's not that good of a movie. I do like that it's based on true events but even that doesn't have much appeal. Tiffani's acting was good as was Patty's but the rest of cast felt kind of flat and the plot moved way to slow.,1448582400,,427,3.9195402298850577

5582187,5,B00BDZV8ZM,"I was a kid when I first saw this movie on TV, back in the day when Lifetime showed truly great movies.  It is based upon actual events that occurred in Arleta, CA in 1985.  Some of the names have been changed but the events are pretty close to what happened.  Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (a gorgeous, talented actress) plays the part of ""Jenny Monroe""...the victim's real name was Michele Avila, known as Missy to her family and friends.  She is portrayed as a sweet, fun-loving girl with a big heart.  She is a brunette beauty with curves in all the right places.  She is noticed by men wherever she goes.  Unfortunately, this will be the reason for her demise.  She has two childhood friends, girls who develop an intense hatred and envy of Jenny/Missy as they enter their teenage years.  Patty Duke shines in her role as the victim's mother in this riveting drama...viewers will feel the rage, despair, and pain that Mrs. Avila most likely felt in real life.  The two actresses playing Avila's friends/killers are stellar in their performances.  Thiessen (most commonly known as Kelli Kapowski in ""Saved By the Bell"") steals the show as the pretty girl whose life is cut short by her jealous friends.

A truly sad story and excellent acting...as another reviewer noted, it is definitely worth watching.  It shows how evil some people can be, how indifferent to human life.",1391126400,21,1371,4.758474576271187
5582188,4,B00BDZV8ZM,"Patty Duke plays a desperate mother searching for her daughters killer in this shocking true story, co-starring Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and Loretta Swit. A popular 17-year-old girl, Jenny Monroe (Tiffany Amber Thiessen) is found beaten, tortured and drowned in a creek.

Her best friend, Ellen Holloway (Margaret Welsh), swears to find the killer, providing moral support to Jennys mother, Jean (Patty Duke). Moving into the Monroe family home, Ellen becomes like a daughter, helping Jean search for a killer who continues to hide in plain sight.

Originally airing on CBS-TV on December 8, 1992, A Killer Among Friends was based on the 1985 murder of Missy Avila, whose killers were eventually convicted of second-degree murder. Sentenced to 15 years-to-life, one was released after serving 21 years, while the other remains in state prison.",1391040000,,841,5.363636363636363

5582193,5,B00BDZV8ZM,"I recalled this story from the news many years ago.  The movie is based on the murder of Missy Avila. I also saw interviews with the murdered girl's mother.  She appeared on several talk shows that included conversations with one of the murderers - Karen Severson - from prison.  The movie is very well made and Patty Duke's acting is especially superb (as usual).

This story is a reminder that people are not always what they seem, and that there is no limit to the evil that can result from jealousy.  After killing Missy Avila, one of the murderers, Karen Severson actually moved into the victim's home, pretending to find the killer, when what she really wanted was to watch (and enjoy) the victim's mother suffer.  And, to illustrate our pathetic justice system, this piece of human garbage, Karen Severson, has been paroled.",1376179200,39,831,4.776223776223776

8566828,5,B00BDZV8ZM,"My HS best friend and I watched this during its original release and figured out pretty quick who the killer was. We didn't like her from the start, she was just shady and way obvious she was trying to covering up her murder sin with the blame targeted at everyone else. The acting performances are top notch, one of the far better TV movies on disc. A huge must-see, though it was a true-story.",1530835200,,395,4.351351351351352
