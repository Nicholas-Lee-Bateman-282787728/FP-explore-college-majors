7750531,5,B01FKR4HO2,I am a hardcore fan of the series (Root&Shaw) all the way. The theories in the show. I began to watch the show and even though I liked it. It wasn't anything extraordinary but everything changed when Amy Acker showed up and the chemistry with Sarah Shahi.... off the roof. Jim Caviezel is excellent and Taraji . Michael Emerson was so good in his character that I hate him(FINCH) for it LOL. Watch the series ship Shoot and you know what I mean. So sad it didn't get the recognition the show and actors deserve!,1471737600,3,511,4.389473684210526
7750532,5,B01FKR4HO2,"Being a die-hard fan of PoI, I ordered this complete set as soon as it was released. This is the first time I buy a TV series set on Amazon. I never bought Blu-Ray discs before, and the optical drive of my laptop doesn't support Blu-Ray format, so I got myself a USB optical drive for this. I received the package today and tried it with the new USB drive. All I can say is the set is amazing, with frames in high clarity and audio tracks and subtitles of different languages available (it would be great if Chinese language is supported). This is a set worth collecting. P.S. I do hope PoI would get its spin-off someday.",1471564800,14,622,4.279661016949152
7750533,5,B01FKR4HO2,"Fantastic show, acting was superb, and the story lines were cutting edge with just the right amount of humor.  CBS you dropped the ball when you cancelled this series.

For those that haven't seen the show, watch just a few episodes and you will be a fan too. They did a nice job on this complete series set.",1471478400,21,424,4.0476190476190474

7750541,1,B01FKR4HO2,"It seems that people that loved it commented quite a bit.  The fact that the series barely made it's last season shows that the real story was that it just wasn't doing it for most people.  They just stopped watching it.  I loved the show the first 2 seasons.  The characters and story was very good for me.  I related to the thought of government watching us, corruption at every level, and justice being twisted into an income revenue for those in power.  By the third season, something changed.  It was dumbed down so much it became just about unwatchable.  Then they killed off one of the best characters and brought in a 100 pound eye candy joke.  I am a construction worker.  You couldn't throw the Shaw character hard enough to move the people I work with.  She could hit them with a bat and barely get their attention.  She was beating up ex military men that weighed over 200 lbs.  That is television for 10 year old boys.  The whole show became a joke.  I watched the first 2 seasons again and realized that I will never watch this show again.  The last 3 seasons ruined the first 2 for me.  Reese whispered in a made up husky voice that was just plain annoying.  So much potential.  Maybe someone in real power was embarrassed or afraid of people waking up to the real world and had to put a stop to it.  Whatever the cause, the show ended badly.",1518739200,2,1357,4.330677290836653

Henderson, Amy Acker and Jim Caveziel) and an intelligent, thought provoking story.  Really, how far are we from a future with a benevolent ""Machine"" watching and listening, or, would a Samaritan be employed in service to an Orwellian regime?

Not much in the way of special features though (if that's your thing).  Good addition to my collection.",1517961600,2,464,5.052631578947368

7750553,5,B01FKR4HO2,"First of all I am a television skeptic.  I hope for the best but tire quickly of mundane brain fodder.  Over the past few years I have developed a habit of ignoring popular taste and wait until a show finishes its run before deciding whether to invest my time and binge-watch the finished work.  Many shows jump the shark over the course of their run and I want no part of that.  Aside from being unable to offer salient comments to office water cooler talk over the entertainment de jour, I feel I lose nothing but instead preserve time better spent elsewhere.

""Person of Interest"" takes a topic from the headlines (Artificial Intelligence and government surveillance) and makes the future seem current.  But far from a sci-fi shoot-em-up, this series sharpened its intelligence as it matured.  (I have just finished my second binge watch of the entire series and am starting a third.)  The characters that populate this world are wonderful and flawed.  Good guys are at times bad and bad guys resist a hackneyed plunge into one-dimensionality.  The motivations behind evil forces are understandable, if not convincing. Ruthless killers may discover a capacity for change and redemption and often become heroes.  Hope for the human soul springs eternal.

What begins in seasons one and two as an excellent series kicks into hyperdrive in season three with the introduction of a rival AI system in what may be a battle to the death.  What is at stake is not only the survival of one system or the other but the free will of the humans the victor will either dominate or serve.  Can an artificial intelligence be instilled with an artificial moral compass?  The final two seasons are as moving and poignant as anything I have ever seen on television.  The great question of the series is whether humans will sacrifice the free will of choice over their own lives in exchange for protection of an all-seeing power. And if we relinquish free will, of what value is humanity?  In a post-911 world many are willing to trade personal freedoms for the security of promises of safety.  Unfortunately there are many willing to retract our freedoms in a quest to control us.

At the series end mankind and machine seem to merge into one with the AI having learned the human capacity for compassion.  As The Machine sums up so eloquently the ephemeral, fleeting nature of human life:

""I was built to predict people. But, to predict them, you have to truly understand them.  So, I began by breaking their lives down into moments.  Trying to find the connections, the things that explained why they did what they did.  And what I found was... that the moment that often mattered the most... the moment when you truly found out who they were... was often their last one.

''Someone once asked me if I had learned anything from it all. So let me tell you what I learned. I learned everyone dies alone. But if you meant something to someone... If you helped someone... Or loved someone... If even a single person remembers you... Then maybe you never really die. And maybe... this isn't the end at all.''

This is a series that pays off, in its conclusion, for having had faith in the consistency of its message. Binge watching was created for works like this.  It allows you to see in a continuous narrative things that are often lost over weeks and years of viewing.  Like a great sweeping novel.  Or a Mozart symphony -- building a gradual emotional ascent to a moment of epiphany.  Beautiful.  Quite simply, this is the best TV drama EVER.  It touches at the very root of what makes us human and holds that tenuous beating heart for us to see.  It will move you.",1514678400,3,3652,4.65625
7750554,5,B01FKR4HO2,"We all love this idea that there are real hero's out there. This TV series is about preventing the unthinkable from happening. And is it possible to prevent terror and acts of violence from happening. With modern technology it's possible. This show promotes this possibility. Of course on this show a smart guy builds a device that would help the Government in preventing the next 9-11. But can we trust the people in our Government with this technology and they not abuse it. This is pretty much what its about. The cast is great and the characters really know how to play their parts.

7750573,5,B01FKR4HO2,"I love Person of Interest.
I kind of fell into watching this show because I like watching procedure crime dramas and thsi sounded slightly offbeat and interesting yet still had the element that I liked in it. I kept watching it because it was thoughtful and intelligent and interesting.

Essentially there is a man who is very smart who created a computer that could predict future crime. His name is Finch and he found out that the computer could send him numbers that would help him help others. He recruited another man named Reese to help him help others. Together they recruit another two people (both cops) and the four of them try to stop crime before it happens or solve it after it has occured.

The first season pretty much follows that premise. Solving or preventing crimes with a high tech advantage on the part of the good 'guys'.

This doesn't continue though. As the show progresses you get to know more about the characters as the develop depth and breadth and you learn about their foibles and problems. Additionally, the computer kicks in as another character. As the seasons continue you get to know the computer as an entity in 'her' own right. The characters address the computer, negotiate with it and trust it. This continues and you see the computer work to save 'herself' when under attack. All of the characters respond realistically to a variety of situations. I like that the women in the show are strong characters that stand on their own and contribute towards moving this show forward.

Although there is a little bit of romance this is not the driving force of this show. There are not bedroom scenes and you will not cringe with the amount of swear words you hear. I""m trying to remember and I don't believe I heard one swear word during this show. When there are shooting scenes they are not gory or bloody. There are times you will see someone who has blood on them but it is not gross, it is simply realistic for the situation.

I was sad that this show ended. It did wrap everything up well as it ended though. It did not leave you hanging.
I really liked this show. The charactes were thoughtful, acted with intent and were strong people. The show explored a variety of themes about intelligence, intellegent life, what is life and more.",1492473600,,2275,4.607407407407408

7750580,1,B01FKR4HO2,The show was so good until for some stupid reason they started changing the characters that didn't fit the story and messed the whole thing up.  The Last 2 season where they decided to make 2 of the characters lesbians really made me mad since it didn't even fit the story.  The whole time the characters hated each other and tried to actually kill each other.  But no next season they are madly in love with each other and the characters changes just ruined the show with no talent of writing I had ever seen.  What the hell is this crap.  The characters were already establish but someone decided they had to be lesbians and ruin the show.  Its like the writers of the show think people are stupid and are filling a lesbian quota.  Man this was a great show but then they had to crap on the dam show and ruin it.  Ending was terrible.  The show was about hope only to say at the end hey there life sucks and they should die.

The Quality of the recording is terrible. It goes black at every spot that there is a commercial. Each season is on numerous disks, and the picture is blown up. The last one I will rock my aspect ration settings on. I'm so ticked that I spent that money on a chopped up copy. I love Amazon but know they won't take an open box back.

You can get Season 1-4 of Person of Interest on sale for $10.00-$15.00 a pop
both Amazon and WB have these four seasons on sale a lot
Do the math
The 5th and final season only had 13 episodes unlike the previous four seasons that had 22/23 episodes
Just buy each season piece by piece you'll save in the long run and just wait for Season 5 to go on sale
By Black Friday or Cyber Monday season 5 will be $20.00 or less
This set is just silly unless your OCD is out of control and you must have everything complete in a big box  Everyone else shop smart
There is no exclusive content/extras  why should you spend your hard earned money on a set this expensive and unnecessary

7750605,5,B01FKR4HO2,"This show now ranks with The X-Files and Hannibal as one of my 3 all-time favorite shows. All 3 shows offer compelling central characters. Unlike TXF, however, the plot of POI holds together across seasons - it's incredibly tight and well-executed. And, while dark in many respects, POI is ultimately more hopeful than Hannibal could ever have been.

My advice if you're starting out with it because of what you've heard about POI over the years: stick with it. It starts out with a heavier emphasis on traditional procedural elements (no doubt because of network pressure) and never loses the mandate to create some standalone eps to fulfill its typical 22-23 episode annual order, and it could seem just mildly interesting at the start. I watched the first season over the span of several months. I watched Seasons 2-5 in about two weeks. Once it gets going, it quickly hits a pace and a level of writing and acting and plotting that makes me feel like it must have existed in an Emmy blind spot because this show should have been cleaning up awards. Don't give up on it if it doesn't grab you from the first half of the first season. It transforms from a pretty interesting procedural that you could watch while folding your laundry into a subversive sci-if masterpiece that requires your full attention.

Kudos also to the show for having created two of the most compelling LGBT characters I can recall seeing on the small screen. They are so fully drawn, so intriguing, and have such sizzling chemistry with each other that they've really reset the bar for fully-realized LGBT characters on television as far as I'm concerned.

What an accomplishment this show is. Everyone involved with it should be so proud of their work and for their prescient vision of the dangers of a world where privacy is so willingly sacrificed for the perception of greater security. Bravo.",1472947200,16,1873,4.792569659442725

8760981,5,B01FKR4HO2,"I was one of millions who loved this show, and I'm happy to own its entire run. Being not your usual take on speculative fiction, it's partly ""what-IF this"" and partly ""what ABOUT this,"" as a lot of its what-if is already here.
Filmed in New York, the show had its pick of the outstanding actors who work there. From Principals to Extras, the entire cast are outstanding performers.
Those millions and I are not pleased that the show was cancelled, and I like to think that NBC have been grinding their teeth since seeing how the final episode turned out  and obviously didn't HAVE to be the final one.
One thing I miss in the DVDs themselves: they don't give a prcis of any of the episodes  to aid the viewer in selecting what to watch  only their titles, which most people never know.",1537315200,,786,4.406896551724138

It is very interesting , has much adventure, excitement, love, commitment, is witty and surprising. All the actors are great and so diverse. Even the dog is such a plus to the serious.
