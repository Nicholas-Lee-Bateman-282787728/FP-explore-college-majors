Both films are rather sentimental - a characteristic that Iranian cinema can be prone to, with it's regular focus on children.  I've heard that this is especially typical of the director, which may be part of the reason why he's one of the more popular filmmakers at home, as well as one of the better-distributed outside of Iran.  He's been compared to Steven Spielberg in terms of his accessibility and huge audience within his home country, and not without some justification, though obviously their works are worlds apart in genre and production.

Sentimentality is present to some extent in ""Father"" (""Pedar"" in Perian), which not surprisingly involves a relationship between a father (stepfather in this case) and son, but it's a muted sentimentality and the film is largely one of rage and sorrow. A boy, Mehrollah (Hassan Sadeghi, impressive even if the role is fairly one-note) goes back to his remote village after working in the city to make money to help his widowed mother and sisters, but he finds that she is remarried to a policeman (Mohammad Kasebi), and, enraged, he refuses to stay at home, at first camping out in the family's old and now abandoned home. Both his mother and stepfather try to be patient with him, but to no avail and eventually he runs away, doing something that ensures that his stepfather will have to chase him.

While the story is fairly compelling, Mehrollah's unvarying and never well-explained hatred of his stepfather, and refusal to even listen to anybody else, gets to be a bit much eventually. Sure, he's an adolescent (maybe 13?), but we know nothing about him before we see this interaction, and thus he's never a very sympathetic character. And the father starts out fairly likeable but becomes less so when his temper flares - and the actions of both in the last third of the film make little sense unless one is to see it allegorically, but if such a reading can be made, I lack the perspective or knowledge of Persian culture to be able to make that leap.  And, too, it's possible that Mehrollah's overall behavior towards a new and unforeseen father-figure makes more sense in Iranian village culture than it does in mine.

In any case it's a beautiful looking film, both leads are good, and there are some nice sequences in the long chase that takes up the last third of the film. If you're interested in Iranian cinema or the storyline it's worth a look, and it's a ""tougher"" film than those that have made Mehrjui's reputation, so this is another point of interest.",1380844800,,3098,5.271805273833672

8028216,5,B0002JC5DY,"Directed by Majid Majidi, who would later helm the better known Children of Heaven, this Iranian film is set in a working class milieu, and it tells the story of a teenage boy, who after his father is killed in a traffic accident, has to leave school and start working in order to support his family. He is proud of being, at such a young age, the person bringing the bread to his poor family. But things change when his widowed mother marries a police officer. He regards this as a double betrayal, and he tries to make life for his family impossible. After putting his two young sisters in jeopardy (in a domestic oven, in one of the film's best scenes), he flees to a port city. The policeman follows him, and in the road back they found themselves in the desert, in a final chase scene that is among the best thing I ever saw. Eventually, and in extremis, adoptive father and son reconciles. Perhaps the best thing of the movie is the portrayal of the policeman. His manners are a bit rough and unpolished, but in his heart he is a good man; it would have been much easier for the film to portray him as a monster, but happily this was avoided. Another triumph for the humanistic Iranian cinema that surprised the movie-watching world in the 1990s (and which sadly, right now, seems to be going through a bad time, hurt by renewed censorship in the Islamic republic).",1181952000,9,1371,4.444444444444445
