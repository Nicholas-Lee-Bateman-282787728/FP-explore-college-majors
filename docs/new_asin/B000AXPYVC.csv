8080108,5,B000AXPYVC,"As a young boy, Arthur (Kevin Shihadeh) stabs his mother and her boyfriend to death. Years later, adult Arthur (James Courtney) -now in a mental hospital- goes berserk, kills everyone, and escapes. Simultaneously, Linda Kinney (Loren Winters) has just caught her boyfriend in bed w/ another woman. She walks out, and sets out on what turns out to be quite an adventure. Within minutes, she encounters sinister hillbillies and a murderous madman! Said madman quickly dispatches the hillbillies. Yes indeed, Linda has just met Arthur! After managing to flee from Arthur's grasp, Linda goes back to her life as an aspiring actress. Arthur is recaptured, and goes back to the hospital, where he is injected w/ an experimental drug. Astonishingly, Arthur wakes up, kills people, and escapes once more! Obsessed w/ Linda, Arthur will stop at nothing to track her down. THE FREEWAY MANIAC is a low-low-budget, highly cheeezy, schlock masterwork from 1989. Every possible misfire (visible microphone, heinous ""acting"", doofus dialogue, clunky set pieces, etc.) that should be a drawback, winds up being an asset in this criminally inept classic! The real idiocy starts when Arthur tracks Linda to the set of her new sci-fi epic! Watch immediately! For true hyper-schlock fanatics only!...",1404432000,,1280,5.279411764705882

8080110,5,B000AXPYVC,"This movie has some of the worst editing ever. The second vitim is walked up to from behind, stabbed and then all of a sudden the killer is in front of him as he falls to the ground with no blood. How's that work? The acting isn't much better. The script took about five minutes to write.  It's just so bad and so pointless that it's also funny. I laughed at this movie so hard that it hurt. I couldn't go through thirty seconds without breaking into guffaws and keeling over on the floor. I'ts movies like this which allow Mystery Science Theatre to keep on going.",1011398400,3,565,4.280373831775701
