208955,5,6300147444,"While other actors have turned more definitive performances of the great Sherlock Holmes and his loyal friend, Dr. John Watson, perhaps no one has captured the Holmes/Watson dynamic better than Christopher Plummer and James Mason in the classic thriller, MURDER BY DECREE.  This flick has the Great Detective facing off against Victorian England's most vile creature, the killer known only as Jack the Ripper.  However, in the course of his investigation, Holmes finds a trail that could lead to the Royal Family itself.  Full of twists and turns, this film sails smoothly under the sure direction of Bob Clarke, who provides an insightful commentary on the DVD.
While Plummer isn't as quirky as other actors who've played the role, he invests Holmes with a wry sense of humor that makes the character easy to relate to, while still being a formidable presence.  Mason's Dr. Watson has his share of humorous moments, but he never plays him as a buffoon.  Even in his more amusing moments, he retains his stalwart British dignity. It is a special treat when both actors share the screen together and there is when this film especially shines.  You can believe that these characters are long-time friends given the wonderful give-and-take moments throughout the film.  The scene where Watson vainly tries to stab the last pea on his dinner plate, and Holmes' reaction is a classic!!!!  But they don't carry the film alone.  The entire supporting cast is excellent. Donald Sutherland is effective as the medium who provides a vital clue, while Frank Finley makes a wonderfully droll Inspector Lestrade.  Anthony Quayle is solid as the nasty Sir Andrew Warren of Scotland Yard and Sir John Guilgud is British dignity personified as the Prime Minister.  Susan Clark is heart-wrenching as the ill-fated prostitute, Mary Kelly.
Needless to say, this film is a must for Sherlock Holmes fans and for anyone who enjoys a ripping (pardon the pun) good thriller.  Highly recommended.",1044403200,7,1971,5.049382716049383
208956,5,6300147444,"An absolutely wonderful movie by - would you believe it - Bob Clark, the director of ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Porky's"", to name but a few.  I actually saw this movie in the theater during its 1979 release, and have not seen it since.  Imagine how thrilled I was to find that it was to be released on DVD.  If you are a Holmes fan, you just can't do any better than this.  Each actor has their fanbase (Rathbone, Cushing, Brett, etc.) but for my money, Christopher Plummer and James Mason absolutely captured the essence of how I like to think Conan Doyle must have imagined his creations.",1044230400,4,588,4.416666666666667
208957,2,6300147444,"So far, this is the only forum I've located - beyond my local retail outlets - for my complaint about the quality of too many DVD's.
I agree with the other reviewers and think this movie is truly one of the great illustrations of Holmes, but I have gone through a half dozen copies of this DVD from two local retail outlets and every one of them has a three-second stall in the transition from Chapter 14 to Chapter 15!  So, I rate it 2-stars.
I enjoy watching movies, but that enjoyment is ruined by this still scene of a steam locomotive rounding a curve at the beginning of the chapter!
I encounter this phenomenon in fully 10% of the DVD's I buy.  I don't want another disc in exchange; I don't want my money back.  I want the manufacturers to pay more attention to quality control.",1044230400,5,786,4.333333333333333
208958,5,6300147444,"All right, the DVD is in the original mono, and the print has grain and in some scenes some purple scratches. But I'd like to say thanks anyway to Anchor Bay and Studio Canal for putting out what is all in all a great DVD. I didn't expect MBD to come out on DVD, and if it came out I thought such a terrific but relatively obscure movie would probably be dumped on the market as a full screen version with no extras.
However, this is an anamorphic wide-screen version that I can enjoy on my Mitsubishi big screen with my DVD player's enhanced black feature turned on (which really helps clean up and strengthen the picture quality). Including a commentary track, picture gallery, trailer and -- most surprisingly the script -- is all fantastic. I would have liked Christopher Plummer to be on the commentary track, and would have liked Bob Clark to talk more, but these are quibbles.
There's a hard-core fan base out there for this clever, atmospheric and ultimately touching film, and putting forth the effort shown to make this an enjoyable DVD instead of just dumping it on us without any concern for the fans, I'm sure will result in more sales. Thanks for this respectful treatment of a minor classic. I agree with the other reviewers. This is much better than FROM HELL, and the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever.",1043539200,4,1317,4.584745762711864
208959,5,6300147444,"The New York Post referred to this movie as the ""greatest Sherlock Holmes movie ever made"" and who am I to disagree with their esteemed reviewer. Well, I write reviews for a large metropolitcan newspaper also, but I have to say I can find no qualms with their opinion.
I grew up watching the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies on quiet Saturday mornings on BBC2 in my native Scotland, so I am probably always going to enjoy sitting down to a couple of hours with my longtime detective friend and his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson. Although for me Rathbone will always be the definitive Sherlock Holmes (never really cared for Jeremy Brett)I have to admit to finding Christopher Plummer as an entertaining, if somewhat unusual, Holmes in this late 1970s movie.
Based not on one of the Conan Doyle books but on a notion that the Baker Street detective investigated the Jack the Ripper murders (much like in the lesser production ""Study in Terror"" a decade earlier) this sceenplay moves along at a fair speed and examines the actual evidence collected at the time to weave together a theory not unlike that of the more recent Johnny Depp movie ""From Hell.""
What really makes this movie stand out is the quite incredible cast that Clark (yes, incredibly the same guy behind ""Porky's"") put together in this Canadian production. Alongside Plummer is none other than James Mason as Watson. We also have Anthony Quayle, John Gielgud, Donald Sutherland, Susan Clark, Frank Finley and Genevieve Bujold. Put these actors in a handsomly presented production design (quite incredible actually) and combine it with the intriguing and fast paced script and you have what (I would have to concur with the Post is the best Holmes movie ever put to film.",1043452800,69,1738,4.8552188552188555
208960,4,6300147444,"This is a great film, good plot, beautifuly filmed, and an intriguing idea.
The film was remade (though without reference) as the Jonny Depp vehicle ""From Hell"", the ending is happier in the Depp film, but overll this film is much better, and the accents don't jar.",1042675200,,265,4.659574468085107
208961,5,6300147444,"I love Sherlock Holmes movies in their many incarnations, especially Robert Stephens version in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD in Billy Wilder's original LONG FORM PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!).
However, I must think Christopher Plummer is the best Sherlock ever.  He brings so many textures and depth to his Sherlock, for once, making him a living, breathing man.  In Private Life...Robert Stephens gives you a brilliant, heart-wrenching performance - at the point he realises he was been betrayed, and with no words he conveys SO MUCH it nearly tears you apart.  Plummer gives you a similar heart-shredder, as he find Annie Crook in Bedlam, tortured, no longer sane, having retreated from the horrors around her and inflicted upon her, and in the following scene on the train ride back to London.  In a masterpiece of blocking, you don't even see Holmes, you just his reflection in the train window while he talks about Annie.  Compelling, heartbreaking, utterly BRILLIANT, demonstrating Plummer is one of the BEST actors ever to grace the screen.
The story line of Sherlock Holmes meeting Jack the Ripper was first explored by Ellery Queen novel.  In it, Holmes identified the wrong person as the Ripper, hence the one Holmes story never published.  It is brought to Queen and he must solved the 100 year old case.  In Study in Scarlet, with John Neville as Holmes (another superior version, but cannot compare to Decree) the Ellery Queen beginning and end was dropped and the middle part of Holmes chasing Jack was turned into the movie in the 1960s.  Neville is a marvellous actor, but pales by comparison to the virtuoso performance of Plummer.  This version of the Ripper vs Holmes, follows the Stephen Knight book exposing the Annie Crook connection.
Lots of super support from a dream cast, such as Genevieve Bujold as Annie Crook, James Mason as Watson, David Hemmings as Foxborough, Susan Clark (Sister of producer/director Bob Clark - YES, people it is HARD TO BELIEVE the man who brought you Porkies create this masterpiece) as Mary Kelly, Frank Finlay as Lestrade, Donald Sutherland as Robert Lees the psychic, Anthony Quayle as Sir Charles Warren and John Giegud as Lord Sailsbury.
I cannot say how delighted I am this is finally out on DVD!!!",1041292800,97,2279,4.942408376963351
208962,5,6300147444,"I saw this when it came out,and it quickly became a favorite. I especially love the pairing of Christopher Plummer as Holmes,and James Mason as Watson. Both play off each other very well,and Mason provides some sorely needed humor to a very sad and terrifying tale of the Ripper. Sir John Gielgud is his usual haughty,snobby(only in the movie,of course)self. This particular telling of the Ripper tale is very touching,and also very scary,and atmospheric. If you are a fan of the various Ripper theories,and love good acting,you will not be disappointed.",1032480000,9,554,5.0989010989010985
208963,5,6300147444,"Personally, I can't take seriously the old Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies -- although Rathbone was a competent Holmes -- because Nigel Bruce played Dr. Watson as a buffoon. In the books, Watson was an educated, intelligent man and the fact that Holmes' thoroughly surpassed him helped indicate Holmes' genius. In my opinion, it is essential for Watson to be portrayed correctly for a Sherlock Holmes movie to be correctly done. In the recent TV series David Burke played Watson to perfection and thereby enhanced Jeremy Brett's reputation as an outstanding Holmes. In Murder by Decree Christopher Plummer is the best Holmes of all with able support from James Mason as Watson. The movie, in which Holmes solves the Jack the Ripper murders, is outstanding in virtually every respect. In my opinion, this is the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made -- and a great movie regardless of genre. I can't understand why this outstanding movie isn't available on DVD yet, but it's so good that I recommend it in whatever format is available.",1030579200,33,1039,4.977011494252873

208966,5,6300147444,Who doesn't love Sherlock Holmes? This whodunit looks at the possibility of someone in the Royal family who may have or was responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders. Excellent acting by Christopher Plummer and James Mason,1513728000,,224,5.081081081081081
208967,5,6300147444,Creepy and mysterious! Really fun,1513296000,,33,5.8
208968,4,6300147444,"It's 1888, and Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, MD, enjoy a performance of Gaetano Donnizetti's ""Lucrezia Borgia"" at the Royal Opera House. When the audience emerges after the performance, they are accosted by newsboys hawking a special sheet  a third woman has been found strangled in Whitechapel. We actually got to see the murder. But all we can tell of the killer is that he wears a black hat, has full black eyes, and travels through the fog in a horse drawn rig.

Later, back home at Baker Street, Watson asks Holmes a question that is the crux of the mystery: ""Normally, they come to you, when they're in difficulties [with a case]. Why haven't they done so in this case?""

As a matter of fact, when there's a 4th murder, and Sherlock and Watson go the scene of the crime, Sir Charles Warren, head of Scotland Yard, is furious that the famous detective showed up.

""Murder By Decree"" came out in 1979. It is a joint Canadian/BBC production and has top-of-the-line actors from both countries. That includes Donald Sutherland as a spacey medium. In case you didn't know, it is not based on any of the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.

Am I the only one bothered when Sherlock Holmes, in this movie and in other incarnations, tells a cabby to go to 221B Baker Street? The ""B"" just means apartment B in the building. It makes no sense to give a cabby the ""B"" part, nor, as I saw in a Benedict Cumberbatch ""Sherlock"", should the building door actually have ""221B"" on it.

Run time is 124 minutes (including credits). If you purchase it on DVD, there are no subtitles available, which is a shame. The DVD has some Bonus Extras, the most interesting of which is the Commentary Track. I am a fan of a good commentary track, and I can recommend this one for the additional trivia.

Bonus Features:
...A... ""Trailer"" (4 minutes) This is a longer-than-usual trailer and I must say, I think it is one of the least coherent I've seen.
...B... ""Commentary Track"" Bob Clark, director and co-producer, recorded this commentary track.  He says that he likes making period movies, though they have their challenges, ""TV antennas. My god, I hate them.""
My favorite story is about when he was originally casting his lead characters: ""We had Sir Laurence Olivier playing Watson and Peter O'Toole playing Holmes. As marvelous as that would have been, they finally decided that they couldn't work together. They had not been friends, they had been enemies from the beginning almost, but they were both going to put it aside [to be in this film]  but [in the end] they couldn't.""
Incidentally, Clark later directed one of my favorite movies ever, ""A Christmas Story"" (1983) with Darren McGavin.
...C... ""Poster & Still Galleries"" Page through the images using your remote's buttons.
...D... ""Behind the Scenes Still Gallery"" Both B&W and color screen shots as well as stills.
...E... ""Talent Bios"" Biographies of three actors to read on the screen.
...F... ""Screenplay"" This contains a PDF file (to access on your computer) of the complete original screenplay (no notes made on it).

I have watched a lot of Sherlock Holmes mysteries in my day, and the plotting of ""Murder By Decree"" is original and well-done.  At times, especially at the end, there is a little preachifying, while I prefer a movie that lets the circumstance give the lesson. 4.4 stars, rounded down to 4, recommended. I had to get a copy for my mystery-loving Mom, too.

""Thus was born the myth of Jack the Ripper"".

208970,1,6300147444,"Terrible. Nearly everything was wrong. Holmes was overly sentimental, Watson was grouchy and doddering. Both actors were way too old--the original characters in the canon were young men at the time of the Whitechapel murders. And in the film the rooms at 221B were downright palatial. The only positives, from my point of view, were the beauty of realistic sets and locations.  Once you've seen Jeremy Brett as Holmes, no one else can do it.

Sherlock was nothing like the brilliant detective we have all come to know and love. He was portrayed/written as an average Joe-Schmo who was trying to solve a mystery.

There are so many conspiracies about Jack the Ripper, so this was interesting. Would he catch him, or would he get away and leave the mystery open?

It's definitely an old movie (1979) so the quality is grainy, but it's not a movie built on special effects so I didn't notice too much that felt really dated.

This film is based on one of the theories that floated around London at the time of the Ripper murders - that it was Queen Victoria's grandson, the Duke of Clarence (who died under mysterious circumstances) murdering the women to keep a scandal at bay.  This theory has been recently disproved and new evidence has emerged that there was no way it could have been the Duke of Clarence.

James Mason plays Dr. Watson and he does a superb job (as one would expect from his caliber) and I enjoyed watching his character play out.

I give it two stars for the excellent period costumes and casing of Christopher Plummer and James Mason but even with those two heavyweights that should've guaranteed greatness the movie dragged on for two solid hours and had me looking at my watch because it was the most melancholy, unexciting, and downright painfully boring storyline I've ever seen in a Holmes mystery.  Love Christopher Plummer but his Sherlock Holmes was over the top sappy.  When Sherlock Holmes is crying and plays a touchy-feely overly caring sap rather than an aloof, somewhat cold and calculating sleuth it's just being done wrong.  James Mason makes a good Dr. Watson but there's just no hope for this turkey of a movie with the direction they were given.  Whoever directed this movie should just be slapped and never allowed to make another Holmes movie.  Maybe he saw Plummer in the Sound of Music and wanted him to project his inner Von Trapp in his Holmes but whatever he was smoking it just didn't work.",1457654400,,1046,4.751381215469613

Basil Rathbone, even in black-and-white, still personifies the character, while several actors have given decent performances, and Benedict Cumberbatch has been terrific in the modernized version from BBC.

209589,3,6300147444,"Christopher Plummer, James Mason, and Genevieve Bujold work like dogs in this 1979 movie.  There are arresting cameos from Donald Sutherland and John Gielgud and others -- but it's all undermined by a lackluster script and by a lack of attention to the details of detective procedurals.  And it's really a bad sign that the lack of procedural detail has to be made up for in a final scene in which Holmes has to explain how it all went down.  The film should have SHOWN the basis of Holmes's developing understanding, and we shouldn't have had to listen to a verbal account of it.  That final scene also includes an indictment of the British upper classes which might be interesting -- especially coming from the iconic detective -- if it had been earned, so to speak, by means of what the movie had let us see, and I can't help feeling that if Holmes hadn't had to do so much explaining in that final scene, then the indictment of the powers-that-be could have been written much more pointedly.  The relation between the Jack-the-Ripper murders, which is what Holmes and Watson are ostensibly investigating, and the threat of anarchists to the powers-that-be is very clumsily revealed.  The weakness of the script and the plotting is mitigated to some extent by some atmospheric visual effects -- the foggy London back alleys, the interior of an asylum, a creepy scene at the Docks -- but atmosphere can't make up for the lack of the kind of substance that a detective thriller should deliver.  Even Wikipedia couldn't come up with a plot-summary, and I would guess that that was because whatever it is that links the steps in the action is never clearly shown. Also, loose ends dangle.  ""Where's the child?"" I find myself asking.

All of this is no reflection on the actors -- it's a pleasure to watch old hands like Plummer and Mason go at it and give their characters some credibility in the process.  Bujold and Plummer generate some intensity in the asylum scene, and there are some nice uses made of a sinister coach drawn by a black horse.  Donald Sutherland plays against type as a Victorian psychic and is arrestingly costumed.  So -- credit where credit's due, but overall this is a disappointingly slack piece of film-making.  Its director, Bob Clark, went on to make ""Porky's"" a couple of years later -- ""one of the worst films of 1982,"" said Siskel and Ebert.  OK -- that was a cheap shot . . .",1454544000,,2408,4.635294117647059

209809,2,6300147444,"If you are a fan of A. Conan Doyle, you will be very, very disappointed with Murder by Decree.  Amazingly, the scriptwriters failed to include a single instance of The Science of Deduction in a Sherlock Holmes yarn!  Instead, they have basically given us a Starsky and Hutch story, where the heroes stumble around Victorian London playing detective.
Also amazing, is that the producers were able to convince the likes of Christopher Plummer and James Mason to appear as Holmes and Watson.  These two managed to make the best of the sophomoric script, and make their characters, but not the plot, entertaining.  Susan Clark and the beautiful Genevieve Bujold were also persuaded to appear, but director Bob Clark totally wasted their skills.  Worst yet is a stoned Donald Sutherland as a frightened psychic in a needless subplot.
By now, astute readers have noticed that I gave this show TWO stars.  The second star is for Plummer and Mason;  They alone make the movie barely watchable.  If you don't know anything about Doyle's Sherlock Holmes  or don't care  then perhaps you will enjoy the show. But fans of The Canon should give this a pass.",1453852800,,1144,4.850515463917525

On the other hand, this is a superb Jack the Ripper tale that includes a surprising number of factual points from the real case. It's based on a now discredited conspiracy theory that was in vogue in the 70s, and if you properly suspend disbelief for a work of fiction, it plays out surprisingly well.",1453680000,,522,4.505263157894737

This 2-hour movie could be slightly improved with some editing to get it down to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Although it was a theatrical release, the camera-work and musical score had all the sophistication of a late-1970's TV series. (At first, we thought it must have been a low-budget made-for-tv ""movie-of-the-week"".) Christopher Plummer and James Mason's talents were wasted, and were the only thing that made this movie even remotely watchable. Donald Sutherland was, well, Donald Sutherland a-la Invasion of the Body Snatchers (he's grown since then, but this was not a memorable performance). The ending was contrived and drawn out. The ""who-done-it"" reveal at the end was disappointing. But it was one that would have been impossible for the viewer to figure out based on the clues we'd already seen.

To quote the character ""Lionel Twain"" from the movie ""Murder by Death"" ... 'You've introduced characters in the last five pages that were never in the book before. You've withheld clues and information that made it impossible for us to guess who did it.'",1453161600,,1157,5.154255319148936

It would be better to remaster the video and sound. The end sequence is entirely unnecessary. The partial face scenes of the ""ripper"" likewise take away from the suspense. I don't think Holmes' compassion for Anna is enough to humanize him nor do those scenes do anything but stall the suspense. The film would be much more entertaining and on point without the end sequence (after the hanging), or the second train ride (aside from the short discovery scene), or the partial face reveals of the villain(s).

In Christopher Plummer's portrayal he's human. He laughs, jokes, and shows an emotion that is quite un-Holmes-esque when you think of the shows and movies of late. Holmes fans can have a great debate about the most accurate portrayal but save it for another day. Just enjoy this movie. Sad movie in many ways but quite moving, really.

The pace was ponderous and the plot poorly executed. Plummer exhibited nothing of the Holmes character. Mason was merely adequate. Sutherland's character was added to spare the writers. One of the premier signs of a sloppy film is when they use the last five minutes to explain what they could have integrated throughout had they not either been lazy or unskilled.",1446163200,,492,4.8

James Mason took all scenes with his almost clumsy, stoic and brave rendition.  I had to fight off my preconceptions of Holmes however, after being raised on Jeremy Bretts interpretation which is for  me the epitome of Sherlock Holmes.  This bias had me balking at times with Plummers more emotional and warm interpretation, but once I was able to separate the two portrayals I enjoyed the movie immensely.

The landscape was grim and felt true.  The actors all did well with their roles, the plot was interesting though the last scene was a bit over the top.

It was missing the quirky side of Sherlock, and the idiosyncrasies that makes him tick, that Sherlock fans adore. Plummer played the part pretty straight detective style, but he played it amazingly well, and is very likeable. Overall, it was a very good crime mystery.",1443312000,,594,4.721153846153846

James Mason, a very good actor, seemed a little too bumbling or doddering as Watson.  Christopher Plummer was ""O.K."" as Holmes, but you didn't really get the feeling that he was very insightful in unraveling this Jack the Ripper mystery, and it took way too long to get to the final resolution, which was somewhat unsatisfying.  Although Conan-Doyle never wrote anything pitting Holmes against ""Jack the Ripper,""  for a far better movie on that subject, I recommend ""A Study in Terror"" from 1965, with John Neville as Holmes and Donald Houston as Watson.",1440115200,,671,4.964285714285714

It captures the foggy atmosphere of 1800's London perfectly. The cast is incredible, with Christopher Plummer in one of his best roles in years, and the same goes for James Mason, David Hemmings, Miss Bujold,et al. The plot sounds as though it could easily be thin, at best, with Sherlock Holmes chasing Jack the Ripper around London. But, quite the contrary, it was believable and intriguing. A lesser cast could never have pulled it off. I'm usually not a fan of newer Holmes movies since Rathbone was so iconic in the part but, truthfully, a lot of the Rathbone/Bruce movies had sub-par plots with a few being basically British propaganda for World War Two.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of excellent, well-made movies whether Sherlock Holmes fans or not; he is just an added plus.

You mean there are no other people walking around night time London besides ""Jack"" and the prostitute he is after? Granted it saves money but is crushes one's suspension of disbelief. And what about all that fog? Certainly, London is often foggy, but in every single scene? The only actor who did not appear to be consistently overacting was Mason's Watson, who too often had downright silly lines. Not that I place the blame on the actors but the way they were directed. And the scene near the end when Holmes confronts the Prime Minister, Home Secretary, and head of Scotland Yard was downright cringeworthy. Obviously, the editor never heard the rule of less being more., especially after just having watched ""A Theory of Everything"" that had about the tightest editing I've ever seen.

210370,5,6300147444,"Even after multiple re-watches and the onslaught of recent adaptations, few Sherlock Holmes films hold a candle to this overlooked classic. A dark, atmospheric rendering of romanticized late 19th century London, where the Ripper lurks in shadow and the motivations behind his brutal mutilations are every bit as terrifying as the atrocities themselves, it's a thrilling, unusually well scripted horror film. To say nothing of how it is, to date, an unrivalled pairing in the Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper sub-genre.

There have been innumerable such themed films and pastiches over the years, but this one outclasses them all. The plot is creative, historical accuracy nearly flawless - and yet, the real gem here is undeniably the portrayal of Holmes and Watson's deep abiding friendship. It is not only that dialogue and deductions are worthy of Canon - the screenplay writer is to be commended for his faithfulness to the great detective and his doctor. In fact, Murder By Decree is equal parts plot, suspense and character study.

And it excels at all three.

Christopher Plummer might not have been my first choice, but so much of the essence of Doyle's characterizations are captured by the team of Plummer and Mason that their age and physical diversions to Holmes of the books are soon forgotten. There is also a distinctive Victorian gothic feel to Baker Street which was missing even from the great Granada series, and despite the non-factual conspiracy theory its based around (From Hell would later ""borrow"" the exact plot, though this is by far the superior version), it has a certain appeal to true crime enthusiasts of Jack the Ripper, and contributes better than any film I'm aware of to the lore surrounding the Whitechapel murders.

It has been several years since I actually watched it, and a recent reviewing reminded me how exceptional Murder by Decree is. I would go so far as to swear it is one of, it not the best, Sherlock Holmes movies ever made.",1431907200,3,1969,4.921686746987952

So I was interested in how Christopher Plummer played Sherlock Holmes. Yes, I liked his characterization.  Still, Jeremy Brett is my favorite Holmes.  James Mason was a very impressive Dr. Watson, and it was fascinating to see Donald Sutherland in a role, too.

The storyline was the weakness of this film as the makers tried to incorporate the Jack the Ripper murders into Holmes' work.

I think the great strength of the Jeremy Brett series is that they are largely based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories.

Without spoiling the plot, it should suffice to relate that all the women knew each other, so they were systematically targeted and not chosen as random victims, as is commonly assumed. They were also mutilated using the written words of a secret organization's blood oaths for direction.

In Murder by Decree you get the same elements and suspects as Jack The Ripper and with Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Dr. Watson you can't go wrong. I have seen others play them but I feel Plummer and Mason play them the best but that is my opinion. There were some moments in the film you would expect to see the real Inspector played by Caine to be there but it is a retelling of the story with Holmes and Watson instead. This is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen it but I have to bring it up being an avid Ripperologest. I don't like how Holmes caught the killers in the act and if any one knows about the case they would know Mary Kelly was torn apart a lot worse. The setting of where she was found where she was living was all wrong too. That being said though the amazing cast following a story that keeps to the facts, the erie London streets with some heart pounding music makes for what I consider my second best and no true Ripperologest should be without.",1400803200,,1089,4.265700483091788

It is not the same as Downey, Jr. & Law, but they are working in a very modern medium where there is more going on than acting; the special effects are the 3rd partner in THAT ""trio.""",1400371200,,431,4.4
210897,4,6300147444,"After getting hooked on Sherlock Holmes books in junior high school I could never get into the Basil Rathbone movies or other interpretations of Sherlock Holmes until Jeremy Brett came along in the Granada TV series.

One thing I greatly appreciated in the Granada series was that the writers and director did not treat Dr. Watson as a buffoon as had happened in most other movie renditions of the characters. While James Mason was not treated as a buffon in this movie his character was grumpy and stodgy and far more rigid than Sherlock Holmes which felt too much like role reversal of the two characters personalities.

One of the most noticeable proof of that was when Holmes and Watson meet with James Leeds (a psychic) and Holmes treats him as credible and Watson treats him like a charlatan. A complete reversal in my mind of how I'd expect both characters to react to a psychic.

Holmes seemed entirely too fallible and, well, human, in this movie. It was the same feeling I got when I'd watch episodes of Star Trek when Spock suddenly began exhibiting human emotions.  Somehow it just felt out of place like the universe had somehow gone out of balance and didn't right itself until Spock began acting more like Spock.

I'd seen this movie many years ago (although for some reason I thought it was much older than 2004) and decided to see if my view of it had changed and as it turns out, it hadn't. The story was not particularly new, Holmes was not particularly brilliant, and the final verbal confrontation between Holmes and the 3 high-level government politician/officials went on way too long. That scene did not really serve much purpose that I could see other than to allow Holmes to climb on a soapbox to exclaim how immoral, pompous, arrogant, secretive, and self serving politicians can be. Not news to the audience and no real closure for either Holmes or the audience on that point.

However, for any fan of Sherlock Holmes it is a decent effort and worth watching. I'd put it ahead of most Sherlock Holmes efforts from the 1930's up until the Granada series that started up in the 1980's.",1400371200,,2111,4.661290322580645

The story itself is no novelty, lying as it does well inside the standard theories about Jack the Ripper. Nevertheless, it is well constructed and well told. But the strength of this film is the performance of Christoper Plummer, and the passion that he gives to Holmes: his sympathy and sorrow about the plight of Annie Crook, and his anger at the conspiracy. Jeremy Brett, my previous favorite Holmes, could have given us the latter, but not the former.

210903,5,6300147444,"'Murder By Decree' has garnered substantial praise since its release, and the DVD cover proudly puts a reviewer quote calling it ""The best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made"" in bold letters right above the title. This is unfair, as while this film is dark and moody, with engaging performances, and an ever twisting mystery, the term ""best"" is always subject to personal taste. However, I can't imagine any Holmes fan who wouldn't jump at the prospect of Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper.

Christopher Plummer stars as the world-famous detective, and he has one of the most unique interpretations of the character ever captured on film. The film seems to be set after Conan Doyle's works, showing a much older Holmes. His age, and his time with Watson seem to have had an effect on him; no longer is he the emotionally detached, coldly calculating man he once was. His genius is still there, as is his rather aloof nature, but he seems to have grown a sense of responsibility, and even a degree of empathy. Holmes doesn't view this case as a game to be won, or a puzzle to be solved; he seems to see it as his duty to use his considerable intellect to end the killings for the sake of the innocent people at risk, not just to stave off boredom. Many people seem to take issue with this, in particular a scene in the movie where Holmes tears up, and visibly fights the urge to cry. I don't wish to give context to this scene, as that would spoil some of the plot, but within the narrative of the movie, it's perfectly understandable, and while a little cheesy, gives the character a greater depth than most actors lend him. This also doesn't mean that Holmes has lost his fire; his sharp wit remains intact, and he hardly shies away from a fight or a chase.

James Mason is easily my favorite Watson. Rather than playing the doctor as a bumbling fool, or an everyman in over his head, Mason's Watson is brilliant, dignified, and world-weary. Instead of reacting to Holmes' long-winded and rapid-fire explanations with confusion or feigned understanding, Mason tends to give a long-suffering sigh, and let Holmes finish before restating his friend's long ramble in a sentence or two, as if trying in vain to teach Holmes that ideas can be expressed simply. He is also shown to be more practically-minded than Holmes, carrying around a pistol despite Holmes' insistence that one won't be needed, and reining Holmes in when he becomes too aggressive. While there are a few moments that feel reminiscent of Nigel Bruce's Watson, such as Watson trying to locate a potential victim of The Ripper, but ending up under arrest for soliciting a prostitute, these moments never seem to come at the expense of the character's competence.

Donald Sutherland's presence in the film is easily the most baffling thing about it. Not only is having a Canadian actor in a London setting a bit jarring, but the fact that he's a genuine psychic make him feel utterly out-of-place in a Sherlock Holmes story, which are usually grounded in the realm of the real world. This is made worse by the fact that the film never lets you forget that he's psychic, as every time he's on screen, he goes into a trance and spoon-feeds Holmes some information that Holmes had either learned already, or ends up being completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Sutherland's character only serves as an obvious red herring, and even though you wait the whole movie for Holmes to expose the trick behind his predictions, the moment never comes.

The rest of the cast are outstanding, and the ensemble includes Anthony Quayle, Genevieve Bujold, and the legendary Sir John Gielgud in a brief role. There are one or two minor characters who are poorly portrayed, but that isn't enough to detract from the rest of the movie.

The mystery in this film is primarily a ""why?"" mystery. Early on, Holmes deduces who is involved in the murders, but he can't act without proof, so he begins following every lead he can find trying to get the evidence he needs to put an end to the Ripper Murders. The pacing is excellent, with almost every scene giving some clue as to the culprit, method, or motivation behind the crimes. The only failing of the story is that it draws very little from Ripper lore; neither the ""Dear Boss"" letter nor the ""From Hell"" letter are ever mentioned, the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee and George Lusk are absent, and the media sensation cause by the killings is only mentioned in passing. The only real connections to history are the names of the victims and the locations of their bodies.

I would highly recommend this film to fans of Holmes, as well as lovers of good mysteries, but Ripper fans may be disappointed by the lack of detail, and the fact the the Ripper is almost a non-presence throughout most of the film.",1398384000,,4807,4.68284023668639

210949,3,6300147444,"That was a scary story written by Robert Bloch and it came to mind while watching this movie.  It's a shame that this movie wasn't anywhere near as scary or entertaining as the story.  It's quite well made.  The actors are outstanding and all do a fine job and as one might expect of a Bob Clark movie, who directed Christmas Story,  the era of 1890's London is vividly recreated.  Actually there is a bit of problem with the acting.  Christopher Plummer is in many respects a wonderfully likeable Holmes, extremely compassionate and humane.  This Holmes could be the reformed Scrooge.  Yet there's nothing of the scientific bloodhound or the thinking machine here.  James Mason is suitably clueless as Watson though.  He appeared to have adopted Nigel Bruce as his role model.

The plot involves the conjecture that Jack the Ripper was connected to the Royal Family and that was why he was never brought to justice.  Without revealing too much  of the story, this movie does indirectly connect the Ripper and the Duke of Clarence, long a subject of speculation.  It's entirely credible.

But before it became that way...this 1979 production, featuring Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson, proved so endearing that much talk arose at the time of reuniting the duo, perhaps to explore some of the more popular tales in the Holmesian canon.  Further filming never came to pass, so one must be satisfied with this lone pairing.  The story is a marvelous speculation regarding the identity of the Ripper, and Plummer proves an engaging, energetic, but surprisingly human Sherlock Holmes.  James Mason is poured straight from the Nigel Bruce mold, at times hilarious as Watson.

210993,4,6300147444,"""Murder By Decree"" is a 1979 film that posits the theory that the Ripper killings was a conspiracy. This is also the movie that predated ""From Hell"", another Ripper movie starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Both are well-made movies, though I felt that the script and acting in ""Murder By Decree"" was far superior than ""From Hell"". Another Ripper film I enjoyed was 1965's ""A Study in Terror"" which also has Holmes and Watson taking on the Ripper.

In ""Murder By Decree"", Sherlock Holmes, the gentleman sleuth is called upon by some Whitechapel merchants to solve the Ripper murders. Here Holmes is played impeccably by a dashing Christopher Plummer, who also makes Holmes seem very much human and not just a cold investigator. His sidekick, Dr Watson is ably portrayed by James Mason, and the pair share good chemistry, bantering away naturally, and seem very much at ease in their roles.

As the pair follow each clue, they meet a host of interesting characters, and some really sinister ones as well - there's Inspector Foxborough [David Hemmings] who resents their intrusion, the medium Robert Lees [effectively played by a haunted-looking Donald Sutherland], the prostitute Mary Kelly [Susan Clark] who harbors a dangerous secret, the insane woman in the asylum , Annie Crook [Genevieve Bujold in a brief yet very emotional scene] who may hold the key to solving the mystery, Sir Charles Warren [Anthony Quayle], and even Sir John Gielgud [as Prime Minister Lord Salisbury].

The movie is rich in atmosphere - London looks overcast and gloomy, and the scenes of the murders in Whitechapel are pervaded by an atmosphere of menace. The movie as a whole effectively captures the darkness of the period and the score is well-done as well. Though the story itself is one of murder and evil, there are light moments that offset its grim tone - the camaraderie between Holmes and Watson, the funny situations that Watson finds himself in [he is obviously the comic relief here] are all credibly done and enhance the storytelling.

All in all, I found myself riveted throughout the unfolding of this story and would highly recommend it to fans of period thrillers & Sherlock Holmes.",1396656000,,2184,4.9427792915531334

It is an unlikely paring. However this is not the only surprises. There is what is called a stellar cast. Unusually it takes a play like Hamlet to gather such a cast so it is surprising that they are in this film.

211035,4,6300147444,"Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music, Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus) reprises his role as the great detective, two years after the 1977 telefilm version of the Conan Doyle-penned Silver Blaze. This pseudo-sequel finds Plummer joined by a different, less ""English"" Watson, ably played by the versatile James Mason. Mason's portrayal of Holmes' right-hand man is, in fact, so enjoyable, that one wishes it hadn't been his only outing as the 2nd fiddle/good doctor. Our story treads familiar territory---the Ripper murders, royal intrigue, secret societies. Indeed, it shares some plot-points with 1966's A Study In Terror, which also had Sherlock pursuing dastardly Jack. This is forgivable for 2 reasons. 1) Before widespread dissemination of on-demand home cinema, in all it's forms (Betamax to Blockbuster to Amazon Prime), the likelihood of seeing 2 films with similar plotlines, & duplicate characters, close enough in viewing as to clearly compare, was very small. 2) Murder By Decree is better than Study In Terror. Much like Cumberbatch & Freeman's most current pair, Plummer & Mason deliver action, adventure, wit, &, at times, a cheeky ""wink"" at all the traditional Holmeses & Watsons, who came before (most notably Rathbone & Bruce). A thoroughly enjoyable romp, tinged only with a bit of melancholy that this particular pair, with deerstalker hat, & medical bag, in tow, did not return for further outings.",1391558400,,1417,5.358744394618834

211064,5,6300147444,"Led by Christopher Plummer and James Mason, an outstanding British-Canadian cast has produced a superior entry in the Holmes-Watson saga. I can think of none better. The atmosphere and settings were near perfect, the story, now a commonplace fictional Jack the Ripper variation on the theme of serial murder, was quite suitable for the underlying theme of injustice in high places, and the pacing particularly apt. Few Holmesian denouement exceed Christopher Plummer and Sir John Gielgud in a frontal confrontation. No Holmes-Watson casting matches the suitability and strength of Plummer and Mason. Notable, too, is the absence of the over-stressed idiosyncrasies of Holmes which sometimes, not always, substitute for good acting. Plummer, in fact, whether by direction or self-analysis (or, likely, both) paces his performance admirably, saving his forcefulness for where it counts most and being sublimely human when that is required. Quite a job. Mason is nigh on to a perfect Watson and that is going some. His Watson is someone it is credible that Holmes would have chosen for an intimate companion. The supporting cast is unusually strong, allowing for even brief appearances to contribute strength to the whole.
I should think this will be felt to be mandatory viewing for any Baker Street Irregular and for any general viewer whose blood is even a little stirred by the ringing cry (absent in this film): Quick Watson, the game is afoot.",1380931200,,1446,5.210300429184549

211076,4,6300147444,"While I have seen better Sherlock Holmes films over the years (and I've seen most of them), this one still ranks pretty high, mostly due to strong acting all-around. But what really took my interest was the Ripper theory presented here. It was really quite unique and intriguing, and would never have occurred to me. Believable? In theory, yes. In reality, questionable, but no more so than a lot of others I've heard. This premise was the movie's strongest point, along with Christopher Plummer's amazing and heartfelt performance, especially at the end, where he gives a lengthy and emotional delivery that was quite powerful and moving.

The film is very slow to start, but gathers momentum gradually. So gradually, that I can't really say at what point it had me absolutely hooked, which I was. The sets were fantastic, giving a real feel for the period. Obviously not a low-budget film. A great amount of attention was paid to visual detail. While there were some exciting moments, I derived most of my pleasure from this film as I do from most Holmes films; by relaxing and letting the story unfold. Very enjoyable when taken on its own merits. If you like fast-paced drama and a lot of action, you won't find much here. But if you like to sit back, relax, and be told a good story, then by all means, give it a go.

The story is not from the Doyle Canon but is an original story that pits Holmes & Watson against Jack the Ripper. (Note: There was a similar film called , ""A Study in Terror"" with John Neville as Holmes made in England in 1965.) The movie was directed by the Canadian director Bob Clark, who directed ""A Christmas Story"" about Ralphie and the BB gun and the teenage raunch comedy, ""Porky's"" and the film, ""Tribute"" with Jack Lemmon.

No more on this for fear of being a spoiler. I say sensationalistic because of the Hollywood emphasis on blood and gore and violence against women. Some of this is stomach-turning.

211113,5,6300147444,"An older but good take on Holmes and Watson (played by the impressive Christopher Plummer and James Mason) though I disagree there is the suggestion of a homosexual relationship between these two characters in the film. Some people can be good friends and not sexual and I know that is hard for some people who have a homosexual agenda to push.

The riddle of this tale is in discovering who is doing the killings in White Chapel and this eventually leads to ""Jack the Ripper"" angle. The serial killer turns out to have friends in high places who indirectly and directly try to stop Holmes and Watson from discovering the truth. Of course it's much more complicated than just being a serial killer and that's this film still holds up to the test of time. The ""aha"" moment is well done and based on a novel by Stephen Knight titled ""Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution"".

The Holmes is much more emotional in this version as he is shown joking and laughing openly with Watson and is moved to tears during a particularly heart rending moment. Donald Sutherland has a tiny role in this picture as this was before he became a bigger star (note that he is the father of Kiefer Sutherland of ""24"").

1 Chris Plummer with his short stature, panting run  and fat nose ain't no sherlock holmes physically..and even worse otherwise. Holmes is not the smiley, loving daddy like guy ..some people have said that an 'emotional Holmes' is a relief..Holmes was not devoid of emotion, not at all. He simply did not show it the way average people do. He spoke rapidly and in low tones, moved very fast and showed flashes of emotion. Jeremy Brett was the true text book example. Plummer plays the same range of emotions he had with Sound of Music and it just looks plain silly.
2 The sets are awful..baker street looks like a stage play, in one scene you can even see the front of the house with nothing behind it..
3 There is no reasoning given for the gory murders other than that the murderers 'wanted it' to look like a gory scene. It is hardly as simple. Jack the ripper was someone who was very intentional and had reasons why he did the things he did. It looks rather shallow to cover up and say that it was done only to get rid of an affair and an illegitimate child.
4 The only releif is James Mason playing a sedate, level headed Watson. Enjoyed him tremendously.

211118,4,6300147444,"Other than the darkness that comes with the 1880's London streets, I found this Sherlock Holmes movie excellent.  Its the first version I've seen of the Jack The Ripper case, where the movie doesn't depend on reenacting the grisly murders. Instead of getting caught up and distracted by visual scenes of blood and violence, you're allowed to focus on the way in which an intelligent investigator applies his knowledge and logic to connect the clues and unravel the scroll of mystery.

The acting might be somewhat dry by American standards, but that could be a plus. Without the hollywood tricks to entice the senses, the descriptive english language of the period gives the story so much intelligence and truthfulness.

Murder By Decree is truly a thinking persons movie that requires attention, as well as reasoning, in order to follow the methods of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Christopher Plummer and James Mason make a very fun pair to travel through London with.

Christopher Plummer and James Mason do a fairly good job with the roles they take but the directing was disjointed and somewhat too heavy on mood shots with entirely too much wandering around in fog filled London alleys, carriage noises and dogs barking off screen.

The inevitable comparison with Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson results in a distant second for Plummer and Mason in my opinion. Plummer's Holmes spent entirely too much time getting knocked around by the bad guys and failing to act decisively when that was needed. In all fairness to Mason I do think his Watson was relatively better than Plummer's Holmes. It's not to say there were no good moments, just not as many as I had expected.

I still believe that, but what made this film so different was the fact that this royal family member had a child with a ""commoner"", which, of course in those days was reprehensible.  The Ripper wasn't killing the prostitutes just ""because"".  It was because the young commoner who had had this child, which would have assumed the throne at some point, was friends with a lot of these women and they were being killed because the royal family could not have a commoner child, thus all the killings were because the ripper was looking for the child to kill her because of royal/commoner issues.

The movie is fairly well-paced, with Christopher Plummer playing a somewhat lighthearted Holmes and the great James Mason playing the conservative but far from bungling Dr. Watson.

The film has its dark moments but at times is frustratingly lacking in giving the facts to the viewer.  For example, Holmes finds a Mary Kelly and another woman, Annie, and both keep speaking of ""they"" and ""them"" but these sources are not revealed.

Maybe it's my desire to figure out the mystery myself, but the clues given are not sufficient.  The Freemasons were clearly involved and the conspiracy may go beyond the authorities to the English Crown itself.

The cinematography is well done, with the London fog, the prostitutes in the pubs and the charlatans and criminals that surround this story.  Holmes, tear-eyed, really gets emotionally involved with his clients and at one point attempts to strangle the head of the asylum!  Wow!

And I love the first-person camera as the viewer becomes The Ripper -- quite exciting.  And the murderer is found and the chase is on!  Blood & murder, quite intense!

MURDER BY DECREE molds a brilliantly-crafted script around the royal conspiracies that have surrounded the murders for decades, making this one of the smartest and most enjoyable Holmes mysteries ever produced on film. Clark lays on a thick, creepy atmosphere with all of the Gothic trappings of the classic Hammer productions. The streets of London have never looked as gloomy or as menacing as they become trapped in a rolling mist and dreary lighting. Christopher Plummer and James Mason form the perfect pair with their winning performances as Holmes and Watson, playing off of each other with a sharp wit and clever banter. Even in the slower moments, the mystery and suspense are kept on a steady high. The humor and intelligence that are built in to John Hopkins' screenplay make the story lively and easily accessible to all audiences, including those that may not be as familiar with either Holmes or the Ripper murders. MURDER BY DECREE is a top-rate mystery, and one of Bob Clark's finest films.

211131,4,6300147444,"I saw this film at the cinema back in 1979, and thought it was pretty tense and scary back then.
In truth, by todays standards it's quite tame as a horror film, and more of a creepy mystery.
Plummer as Holmes and Mason as Watson are both excellent in their respective roles, and the movie now pushing 30+ years old still holds up well, both in story and mood, even if the backdrops and representations of Victorian London look a little cheap.
Viewers who watched the Jack the Ripper story more recently with Johnny Depp in ""From Hell"" will recognize the upper class conspiracy aspects of the story, and that they arguably borrowed directly from this film, for their story.
Holmes is requested to look into the recent ""Whitechapel Murders"" by a group of local blue collar workers, a fact that immediately fuels his interest, as the usual channels of police inquiry, that involve him have been conspicuous by their absence.
As he delves into the case, he begins to piece together a common thread between the victims, and suspicions that point to the corridors of power, a potential Royal scandal, Freemasons, and the chief of police himself.
Unlike a typical Watson, James Mason is not a blustering sidekick but rather a thinking physician, who offers insight and a lot of assistance to Holmes.
He is however, entrenched in the era of the high classes being beyond reproach, and juggles his opinions accordingly, even when presented by the surmise and well founded theories of his colleague.
The story moves at a good pace, and builds tension nicely throughout, as the chase begins to catch the ripper before the next potential victims are also murdered to continue a high class cover up.
I like Plummer as Holmes, he brings a human and balanced compassion to the role, without ever losing the intensity of the character. I also liked the idea of how heinous crimes are being committed with the utmost impunity to cover an indiscretion, like an upper class boys club closing ranks.
You will probably see the end coming a mile away (especially if you watch the trailer included in the DVD extras - please don't do this before you watch the movie!)
That aside, it is worth the viewing, although the case is never completely ""wrapped up"" leaving you feeling a little cheated.
It was a bit of a stretch to imagine Holmes in a meeting with the Prime Minister, Home Secretary, and Chief of Police, condescending and barking evidence, but one must accept that Holmes's pedigree and notoriety as a great detective, would have been enough at that time to carry it off.
On a final note, Jack the Ripper was of course a REAL person who, although his identity was never revealed, killed and mutilated women in London in the 1880's and Sherlock Holmes was a fictional detective, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so don't pull it to pieces for historical accuracy, this is a movie.

This movie has been on my ""must see"" list for a while. The 18 certificate is the highest rating I've seen a Sherlock Holmes film receive (though, cryptically, it was rated PG in the US) and the Jack the Ripper twist seemed like an innovative idea (though the memory of the awful Michael Caine TV movie from 1988 kept me cynical of how it could be incorporated).

Christopher Plummer and James Mason are great as Holmes and Watson (though Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best). If you're a fan of the TV show The IT Crowd try to notice how much Mason's Watson sounds like Douglas Reynolm. Director Bob Clarke shoots the film with a very dark and murky style which is highly atmospheric. If you like the brooding gloomy look to Barry Levinson's Young Sherlock Holmes then you'll love this.

What brings it down, for me, is that the film is just too hard too follow. Holmes seems to keep all of his theories to himself and despite Watson being the usual ""in"" I just couldn't get into the groove. Most secondary characters seem to die moments after being introduced and too much importance is dependent on tiny snips of dialogue that are easy to miss. But I guess that filling the movie with exposition would lessen its value. If you really want to understand the whole movie I reckon second viewing is essential.

211147,5,6300147444,"Ah, Sherlock Holmes.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective character has enjoyed innumerable media incarnations since his first appearance in magazine format in the 19th century.  Basil Rathbone in the 1940s provided the most famous film series, while Jeremy Brett's BBC series in the 1980s was probably the definitive smallscreen version.  But those are just two of the most famous examples (since joined by Robert Downey Jr.'s enjoyably testosterone-heavy verson from last Christmas); 1979's ""Murder by Decree"", an Anglo-Canadian co-production (which would explain the presence of a number of prominent Canadian performers, such as Christopher Plummer, Donald Sutherland, and Genevieve Bujold).  Not an adaptation of part of Conan Doyle's canon, rather, an original yarn, ""Murder by Decree"" is the prominent screen version of one of post-Doyle Holmes authors' favourite story setups:  the great detective vs. Jack the Ripper.  Spoilers follow.

We open in Victorian London with a night at the opera (for a performance of ""Lucrezia Borgia"", which is a subtle tie-in to many of the themes of the film itself), a nifty opening that immediately sets the stage for the simmering class tensions that underlay much of the film (though they don't drive the plot).  The film opens with Jack claiming his third victim, and the police have been confounded, but they have yet to call on Holmes (Plummer), much to his and Watson's (James Mason) puzzlement.  Eventually summoned by an anonymous source, it becomes apparent that the head of the police isn't keen on Holmes' participation.  Engaged by a group of businessmen (or are they?), Holmes takes on the case anyway, and finds himself in the middle of a number of conspiracies (the title itself should tell you a lot, though it's actually somewhat misleading in the end).

As far as Ripper-ology goes, this is a filmed version of the Prince Albert Victor/Masonic conspiracy theory (Sutherland is Robert Lees, the psychic, in a cameo; Bujold is Annie Crook), the one more famously seen in Alan Moore's ""From Hell"" and its cheap film adaptation. This version instantly wins points from me by casting the murdered women as dowdy/unattractive women over 40 (well, apart from Bujold, but she's a long way from a supermodel too), like they were in real life, rather than in ""From Hell"" the film, where they're all sexy twentysomethings.  There's no glamourization of poverty and prostitution here, the same sort of thing that Moore the author was keen to avoid in his writing.  And their take on the conspiracy itself even makes a modicum of sense, since it actually brings up how absurd the idea that any sane person in Westminster or Buckingham Palace would regard a handful of prostitutes as a major threat to the monarchy. In this version, the higher-ups merely think it's ""inconvenient"", and two fairly deluded Masons take this as a sanction to get rid of the supposed problem, which the others then have to cover up to save the Order's face. Actually, it's very Watergate, which makes sense given the time of production.

This is perhaps the best entry on the supremely odd resume of the now-late director Bob Clarke, who had previously made the slasher film ""Black Christmas"", and whose subsequent efforts would include the infamous sex comedy ""Porky's"" and its sequel, and the cult classic Christmas film ""A Christmas Story"" (and ""Baby Geniuses"", but let us honour the dead and never speak of that again).  Plummer is a fine Holmes, though a bit more emotive than many will be accustomed to; personally, I thought it was appropriate to give him a bit of humanity.  A lot of his portrayals tend toward him being a walking brain and far too aloof.  James Mason makes a bid to quietly steal the show as Watson; physically he's in the Nigel Bruce mould, but he's quite competent and not played exclusively for laughs, which is rare enough.  Sutherland is fine in a cameo that seems mainly to serve to keep people guessing whether he'll turn out to have a more substantive part.  Bujold has only one scene, but it's a crucial one, and very well-handled.  Sir John Gielgud cameos as Lord Salisbury, honestly seeming a bit flat.  A group of solid British actors fill out the rest of the cast.

About the movie, well with all the other reviews about it , there is not much to add, but I will say that I do thoroughly enjoy it.

While staying true to Conan Doyle's description of the character in most respects, he adds a little more emotional depth in this interpretation which is effective in giving the character more dimension and helping the viewers to relate a little better. James Mason as a smarter version of Watson than what we're used to seeing and the extremely gifted Genevieve Bujold as a mental patient are both expertly cast. The story is very interesting, imaginative, suspenseful and masterfully told in a convincingly Victorian atmosphere. No Sherlock Holmes fan should miss it.

211150,5,6300147444,"With the release of SHERLOCK HOLMES starring Robert Downey the world has once again discovered the penultimate sleuth. So what better time than now to go back and pull forth from the archives every Sherlock Holmes film ever made? The classics starring Basil Rathbone have been dusted off as well as the first competition between Holmes and Jack the ripper, STUDY IN TERROR. But perhaps one of the best films made about Holmes has been MURDER BY DECREEE.

In a set up is simple: Sherlock Holmes investigates the murders committed by Jack the Ripper. But the story delves more deeply than most would dare and results in a tale more terrifying in its implications than the usual fare. Rather than a simple brush off that pits the most famous detective against a serial killer, we find that there was a possible story behind the murders.

Jack the Ripper is terrifying the streets of London with his gruesome murderous ways, killing prostitutes in the streets and alleys of the East End.  At the same time, Sherlock Holmes (Christopher Plummer) is at odds, trying to find something to pique his interest while between cases. After a night at the theater, Holmes' companion Dr. Watson (James Mason) suggests he use his abilities to find the killer. But this is not to be until Holmes abilities are called upon.

With each miniscule clue that Holmes finds, he discovers that this is not the work of a simple minded brute out to murder for no reason. The skill with which the women are eviscerated shows the work of a surgeon as opposed to a dock worker.

And other clues lead Holmes to discover that there may be ties to a secret organization that fears it may be discovered roaming the halls of government. The problem lies in Holmes finding the right clues and putting them together, finding the right people involved so that he can solve the riddle before more women die on the streets of the East End.

I know this isn't much in the way of describing what it is that Holmes finds or how he goes about discovering one clue after another. But to do so would remove all enjoyment that any viewer would get from this film, not just offering a spoiler but to give away the clues that would be used at the films end when Holmes sums up the tale before some of the most powerful men in England at the time.

Instead know that when you see this film you are witness to several craftsmen at the top of their game, making one of the best detective stories ever filmed. First off is Plummer, best known for his performance in THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but who shines here as Holmes. While watching him at work here you almost forget the collection of Basil Rathbone films that were held up as the epitome of Holmes movies. Plummer shows Holmes with a tough of wit, a bucket of indignation and the compassion that is rarely offered with the character.

We are also allowed to see the genius that was Bob Clark. Clark made a number of films in various genres but never seems to get much recognition. Like director John Badham (who made SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, SHORT CIRCUIT, DRACULA, BLUE THUNDER, WAR GAMES and STAKEOUT), Clark was a director who was never pigeonholed and who gave his all for every film he worked on.

Starting with three classic horror films (CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS, DEAD OF NIGHT and BLACK CHRISTMAS) Clark went on to make this film as well as the drama TRIBUTE, the PORKY'S comedies and one of the most watched films ever, A CHRISTMAS STORY.  It's a shame that he passed away this last year before being recognized for his work.

Clark takes what could have been a routine mystery and turns it on its ear by giving a depth to the tale of Jack the Ripper that few films have. This was in part due to new research into the tale at the time (the film came out in 1979) but it would have been easy to dismiss it all and go for the easy path. Instead Clark offers a new look at the possibility of who Jack was or was a part of. And in so doing, we are presented with a mystery that exceeds most expectations.

I have little doubt that the new SHERLOCK HOLMES film will be a treat. And the classic films that featured Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce will always be fantastic. But for fans of Holmes, don't make the mistake of missing this one.",1263168000,2,4253,4.473548387096774
211151,4,6300147444,"MURDER BY DECREE is one of director Bob Clark's three generally highly-praised films along with the original BLACK CHRISTMAS (1974) and A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983).  Not that they have an enormous amount in common other than their critical reputations and a few members of the cast and crew - but it's striking to compare them to the rest of his filmography - what an up and down career.  This film, made on a fairly low budget in London in 1978 and released in February 1979, offers a more sympathetic and human Holmes (Christopher Plummer) than usual, and an older, wiser and experienced Watson (James Mason) who is very much his equal.  The plot has Holmes getting reluctantly involved in the Jack the Ripper case, and uncovering a cover-up that goes to the highest levels of British government - and a secret society that has penetrated everywhere.

This is an at times cynical, inwardly progressive and feeling, but outwardly despairing Holmes who early on cautions Watson that the crowd that boos the Prince of Wales at a theater performance has good reason to, given the Prince's known appalling behavior - foreshadowing the unpleasantries he will soon become involved in.  For all the low budget, the model work and atmospheric sets look pretty good - this is a film of nighttimes, dirty quays and back alleys, shadows, bloody murders and foggy chills.  The cast is excellent from top to bottom, with Anthony Quayle's highhanded and brutish Sir Charles Warren probably being the standout amongst the secondary characters.

Ultimately though it's Plummer's show, and he brings a warmth and humanity to the role without ever sacrificing the erudition or quick-thinking man-of-action parts of the character's personality.  Perhaps he is TOO humane and concerned with matters of society and progress to be an entirely ""realistic"" or ""accurate"" Holmes, but on the whole I think the filmmakers' choices were the correct ones - when dealing with something as sensational and brutal as Jack the Ripper, the cold analytical Holmes would probably be awfully alienating and even unpleasant to most audiences.  We see a bit of that cold side to the man when he first interviews a group of Whitechapel men who are begging him to take on the case, and it's (deliberately) somewhat upsetting.

Excellent music that verges from atmospheric and low-key to noisy and atonal (by Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer) and soft, wide-angle lensing by Reginald Morris, director Clark's usual DP.  There are some slow spots for me around the halfway to two-thirds mark, and the confrontational ""this is what you did and you'll have to live with it"" scene towards the end seems a bit too moralistic to me, but on the whole this is certainly one of the best of all Holmes films and probably the best of the many Holmes-meets-the-Ripper stories.",1262131200,3,2814,4.953290870488322

I don't have time to detail the elements that make this film so special (and a number of reviews have already done a great job of just that), but this is one of those special films that stays with you, almost haunts you, because of its rare combination of important high notes: the atmosphere created brings you back to Victorian England with unbelievable immediacy.  The writing is crisp and intelligent to support a plot line that is well worthy of the writer's efforts.  The acting transcends the word.  A number of performances are so real as to not interfere in the slightest with the feeling of immediacy created by the atmospherics: Plummer, Mason, Hennings (Bravo!), Bujold, Sutherland, Susan Clark, Anthony Quayle.  All are magnificent.  David Hemmings performance, in particular, stays in your mind like a permanent fixture. My other favorite films include ""Blade Runner,"" ""Carney,"" ""Gladiator,"" and ""Dark Knight"" and so you can see that I am drawn to films that create a world that draws the viewer right into the action for a truly unique experience.

Cinemadom had two tries at this, first with 1965's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Study-in-Terror/dp/B0024FAG8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Study in Terror</a>, then with this one, 1979's MURDER BY DECREE. Christopher Plummer, probably most well known for playing Captain Von Trapp in THE SOUND OF MUSIC, isn't the first actor you'd think of to bring the Great Detective to life and, yeah, whether Plummer succeeds or not in this role will depend hugely on how attached the viewer is to the standard portrayal of Sherlock Holmes as a cold, calculating fish. Because Plummer does something different here with his interpretation.

The year 1888, and Jack the Ripper has begun making his bloody rounds on the foggy, unsavory streets of London's Whitechapel district. Harlots are targeted and murdered gruesomely, and yet another soiled dove falls prey even as Sherlock Holmes and his good friend Dr. John Watson enjoy a night out at the opera house (with Watson coming to the rescue of a rudely welcomed royal). With word spreading of Saucy Jack's dark deeds Holmes is soon implored by a citizen's committee of East End merchants to take on the Ripper case, what with the Ripper not only posing a danger to London's womenfolk but also being decidedly very bad for business. Holmes and Watson begin their investigations, and it's quite a satisfying twist that Watson is here portrayed as capable in his own right. In fact, the good doctor acquits himself quite ably on his assigned solo jaunt (he gets to interview various ladies of the night). But, of course, in the area of detecting, Watson's skills aren't nearly as comprehensive as Holmes's.

Holmes promptly learns that Scotland Yard is reluctant to accept his services for this case. Still, he eventually sniffs out a vast cover-up at work, spanning the brothels of Whitechapel and an out-of-the-way loony bin and all the way to the hallowed halls of government and implicating the English throne itself. The Great Detective all too quickly learns it's challenging stuff nabbing a murderous bogeyman who also happens to have friends in very high places. In fact, this movie isn't about Holmes matching wits with the Ripper as much as it is Holmes going up against a powerful political conspiracy determined to keep its secrets locked away. The Ripper, as it turns out, is a mere symptom.

For fans of Sherlock Holmes, the 1970s must've been sheer bliss. That decade saw several pretty entertaining Sherlock Holmes films, not only MURDER BY DECREE, but also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Private-Life-of-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B00005JKHF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</a>, SHERLOCK HOLMES IN NEW YORK, and THE SEVEN PER CENT SOLUTION (my personal favorite of these four). MURDER BY DECREE shines on the merit of its production values: the moodily realized period setting, the convincing costumes, the look of the characters. And, evidently, the film has remained fairly faithful to historical events and characters even as it shuffles in its Holmesian embellishments.

As revealed in the director's commentary, Peter O'Toole and Sir Lawrence Olivier were initially considered for the Holmes and Watson roles, but the two apparently just couldn't get past their mutual dislike. But, as celebrated as those two actors are, they would have been hard pressed to match the chemistry, warmth and sense of ease demonstrated by Plummer and Mason in their scenes together. Plummer and Mason combine for simply one of the most touching Holmes/Watson pairings ever, and one can really sense that deep and abiding friendship which roots their relationship. And nothing typifies this camaraderie more so than the amusing Puzzle of the Solitary Pea or the Adventure of Holmes Bailing Watson Out of Prison.

The controversy lies in Plummer's straying from the typical reiteration of Sherlock Holmes. Even though his Holmes still flaunts that penetrating intellect, the disguises, the deerstalker cap, Inverness cape, and the Meerschaum pipe, Plummer also invests him with a depth of sensitivity and a surprising emotional core. I'd never seen the guy grin or chortle so much. Count me, too, as one of those folks who finds that scene in which Holmes tears up at the insane asylum to be a jarring one. James Mason, on the other hand, is sublime. As mentioned, his droll Dr. Watson is presented as more Holmes's equal - ergo, less bumbling and more perceptive.

For its time, this film was looked at as an all-star cast. The two leads, plus John Gielgud submitting a cameo as England's Prime Minister, Genevieve Bujold who is sympathetic in the pivotal role of the institutionalized Annie Crook, and Donald Sutherland as a wacky psychic. A casting conceit worth mentioning is that of Frank Finlay again taking on the part of Inspector Lestrade.

Note that MURDER BY DECREE takes a page from Stephen Knight's 1976 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-the-Ripper-the-Final-Solution/dp/1850510148/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution</a>, a book which must also have been thoroughly pored thru by Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell for their graphic novel FROM HELL, later adapted into a 2001 film. If you've seen FROM HELL, it's kinda fun spotting the points of similarity between it and MURDER BY DECREE (and I guess you can do the same with A STUDY IN TERROR). FROM HELL, of course, doesn't have Sherlock Holmes in it. And neither does FROM HELL reveal the honest-to-gosh super-duper clandestine handshake of the Secret Order of Freemasons.

DVD special features now: informative, low-key commentary by director/co-producer Bob Clark; a Behind-the Scenes Still Gallery; a Poster & Still Gallery; talent bios for Plummer, Mason, and Clark; the theatrical trailer; the original screenplay available as a PDF file for those with DVD-ROM capability; and a 12-paged insert booklet titled ""Jack the Ripper, I Presume"" which includes a reprint of the film poster and an article by Anchor Bay's Michael Felsher regarding the film.

I dig the creepy atmosphere, and ultimately I even got used to Plummer's interpretation of a more touchy feely Holmes (some people may not get used to it). Several things bring the film down a few notches. First is the stuffy script, resulting in a film which is perhaps too talky. I get it that a Sherlock Holmes story tends to be more cerebral than action-packed. But, considering that it's the notorious bloody Saucy Jack serving as the Big Bad, I expected a more ramped up level of suspense, chills, and violence. As it is, the pace is sluggish and the grotesqueries are implied more so than enacted. The film also could've benefited with more of Holmes's standard parlor trick observations. And then this: Holmes gets his behind handed to him a few times before he finally springs into manly action, taking on the Ripper with only a weighted scarf, except that by that stage, I'd already marked him as a Victorian era wimp. Question: Just how often can Sherlock Holmes get knocked senseless? Answer: quite often (I thought the great man practiced Bartitsu?).

MURDER BY DECREE makes for intelligent, atmospheric cinema and it even has unexpected moments of humor. Holmes investigates a powder keg of a mystery, one which he finds himself ultimately better off not solving publicly, for the good of crown and country. We also see a rare moment for Holmes, that of a misjudgment on his part which results in tragedy. If you're a diehard fan of Sherlock Holmes, then this is a fascinating movie pastiche, with Plummer's performance being a polarizing element. But, as an edge-of-your-seat nail biter, it falls short of the mark. For that, you'd do better to check out the terrific sci-fi thriller movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-After-Time/dp/B001BGS17Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time After Time</a>, which offers a grudge match between Jack the Ripper and none other than H.G.

211166,5,6300147444,"Conspiracy theorists will love ""Murder by Decree.""  Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are investigating the Jack the Ripper slayings in Whitechapel.  The two friends soon learn that it is not the work of a single madman but several.  They are being followed, their investigation manipulated, and their lives endangered.  Don't expect a tremendous amount of blood and gore, but there is quite a bit of brutality, both emotional and physical.

  ""Murder by Decree"" boasts quite an impressive cast of actors that is a virtual who's who of seventies stars.  Christopher Plummer (""The Pyx"" and ""Dracula 2000"") and James Mason (""Mandingo"" and ""Salem's Lot"") give intelligent, energetic performances as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively.  Donald Sutherland (""Don` Look Now"" and ""Virus"") stars as a psychic who witnesses the murders in his mind.  Fans of the giallo masterpiece ""Deep Red"" will recognize David Hemmings as an unscrupulous inspector.  Genevieve Bujold of ""Coma"" and ""Earthquake"" fame is an innocent woman locked up in an insane asylum; Holmes and Watson endeavor to learn her secret before more prostitutes are murdered.

  The sets are extremely authentic and breathtaking in their scope and beauty.  I felt that I was actually looking back in time at London during 1888.  A great soundtrack is provided by Carl Zittrer and Paul Zaza.  Incidentally, Zaza provided a great disco soundtrack for another ripper movie, the horror hit, ""Prom Night,"" starring Jamie Lee Curtis.  Most importantly, ""Murder by Decree"" is expertly directed by Bob Clark; he is world renown for directing such horror hits as the classic ""Black Christmas,"" ""Deathdream,"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.""  Ironically, he also directed the ever popular family classic ""A Christmas Story.""  Films such as ""Murder by Decree"" prove that Bob Clark was an expert at directing films of all genres.

  If you are a fan of gothic horror, a fan of Jack the Ripper, and/or a fan of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, you will definitely want to add this film to your horror collection.  Anchor Bay has done a superb job of restoring it to a high quality widescreen presentation of 1.85:1.

I liked the close-up of the Ripper's eyes near the beginning, and the tender way Mrs. Lee placed her hands on her husband's shoulders. It was fun watching Hemmings in a different role from when he was Modred, Richard Harris' King Arthur's son in Camelot, and Bujold playing so different a character from the one she played with Robert Shaw in Swashbuckler. I gave the movie 4 stars because Plummer came across as a little too emotional at times, but listening to the haunting melody he plays at the end, both sad and hopeful, is a treat to my ears.",1232150400,3,859,4.477707006369426
211170,4,6300147444,"""Murder By Decree"" is a 1979 film that posits the theory that the Ripper killings was a conspiracy. This is also the movie that predated ""From Hell"", another Ripper movie starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Both are well-made movies, though I felt that the script and acting in ""Murder By Decree"" was far superior than ""From Hell"".

In ""Murder By Decree"", Sherlock Holmes, the gentleman sleuth is called upon by some Whitechapel merchants to solve the Ripper murders. Here Holmes is played impeccably by a dashing Christopher Plummer, who also makes Holmes seem very much human and not just a cold investigator. His sidekick, Dr Watson is ably portrayed by James Mason, and the pair share good chemistry, bantering away naturally, and seem very much at ease in their roles.

As the pair follow each clue, they meet a host of interesting characters, and some really sinister ones as well - there's Inspector Foxborough [David Hemmings] who resents their intrusion, the medium Robert Lees [effectively played by a haunted-looking Donald Sutherland], the prostitute Mary Kelly [Susan Clark] who harbors a dangerous secret, the insane woman in the asylum , Annie Crook [Genevieve Bujold in a brief yet very emotional scene] who may hold the key to solving the mystery, Sir Charles Warren [Anthony Quayle], and even Sir John Gielgud [as Prime Minister Lord Salisbury].

The movie is rich in atmosphere - London looks overcast and gloomy, and the scenes of the murders in Whitechapel are pervaded by an atmosphere of menace. The movie as a whole effectively captures the darkness of the period and the score is well-done as well. Though the story itself is one of murder and evil, there are light moments that offset its grim tone - the camaraderie between Holmes and Watson, the funny situations that Watson finds himself in [he is obviously the comic relief here] are all credibly done and enhance the storytelling.

All in all, I found myself riveted throughout the unfolding of this story and would highly recommend it to fans of period thrillers & Sherlock Holmes.",1223424000,,2068,4.968208092485549
211171,4,6300147444,"So it isn't the most original idea out there for Sherlock Holmes to attempt to solve the case of the infamous murders committed by Jack The Ripper. At least one other film (A Study In Terror) and several books have (had) been written along those lines so the storyline could have been predictable. Yet Murder By Decree rises above what could have been a tired and predictable story to deliver perhaps the best non-Doyle based Holmes film. It is a must-see for fans of Holmes and does supply an interesting solution (pardon the pun) to the mystery of the Ripper.

Christopher Plummer gives an exceptional performance as the great detective. Whereas others had played Holmes as the intellectual with little emotion, Plummer takes Holmes and makes him more human. While he is still the intelligent and brilliant deducing detective of other films, he does have an emotional side that comes into play several times throughout the film. James Mason might come across at first as the bumbling, idiot Watson of earlier films but as the film progresses he proves to be anything but. There are scenes were Watson does get to prove himself and he is anything but bumbling. The chemistry between Plummer and Mason is ideal for the film and there are many great scenes between them including the famous pea scene.

The supporting cast is ideal as well. David Hemmings is an interesting Inspector Foxborough though he does lack some believability in the role. Donald Sutherland is fascinating as the psychic Robert Lees and it is a shame we don't get to see more of him in the film. Susan Clark's brief appearance as Mary Kelly is impressive and it is a shame that we don't see more of her either because her scene with Plummer's Holmes is a good scene. Anthony Quayle portrays real life Scotland Yard chief Sir Charles Warren with a lot of animosity towards Holmes and other characters. Also, there is a cameo by Sir John Gielgud as the Prime Minister in one of the film's best done scenes.

But the real scene stealer of the supporting cast is Genevive Bujold as Annie Crook. She has only one scene of dialogue in the film and only a handful of appearances in the film. Yet she becomes the emotional anchor of the entire film. She is the one character in the film (besides Mary Kelly) who really draws the emotion out of Holmes. She is the most sympathetic and realistic character in the film and while her appearance is short, it leaves a lasting impression.

The film's main pull is its stylistic approach. For the most part the film is a dark and moody trip into 1888 London and the film never lets you forget it. With its convincing mix of sets and real life locations the film is virtually flawless in taking you back in time. The cinematography of the film is important in that the film is almost at times a tribute not to the Holmes films of the 1930's and 1940's but to the film noir genre of that period. It is never overly graphic and yet the horrendous nature of the Ripper murders still comes across. The film also has a good mixing of suspense, action, and exposition that manages not to slow down the film too heavily for the most part though the pace does occasional drop. But for the most part director Bob Clark manages to keep your attention focused on the screen and in suspense while waiting to learn the secret of the Ripper.

The script from John Hopkins is a near masterpiece of screen writing. Hopkins has successfully intermingled established facts, the Holmes universe, and one of the darkest conspiracy theories of our time into a taught and tension filled mystery. Never has such a complex theory about the identity of Jack The Ripper been so well presented on screen in a way easy to understand by the average person. While the authenticity of the theory put forth in the film is debatable, it fits well into the film and that is what matters.

Murder By Decree is one of the best Holmes films out there. With a terrific Holmes and Watson, a good supporting cast, haunting cinematography, and a tension filled conspiracy, this is one of the most thought out thrillers out there. If you are a Holmes fan, this is a must-see. If not, defiantly worth your while.",1217376000,6,4176,4.613728129205922

 The transfer is wonderful. Sharp, but still giving you that slightly understated sense of color vibrance you expect from English films reflecting this time period.

 The sound is in mono, but there are hardly any scenes that would warrant any great speaker seperation. Yet the sound is pretty good. There were times in the outdoor scenes where the actors' lines were partially obscured, but it was forgivable.

 The commentary is great. It has somewhat large gaps, but I found it insightful about the production of the film, as well as Jack the Ripper and Holmes lore.

When both have been bloodied by the bad guys, they're passing their one gun back and forth between them is both amusing and very touching. Watson is the epitome of the decent citizen who staunchly supports Queen and country. Holmes is less gung ho but the movie turns when he too is caught in the riptide of social change and conspiracies. The dream cast is like a who's who of the 70s; Anthony Quayle, David Hemmings, Frank Finlay, Genevieve Bujold, Susan Clark, Donald Sutherland and even John Gielgud shows up at the end.

So much so I hoped that he would team up with Mason again for another adventure. Speaking of Mason, I, like many of the others reviewing this movie feel that Mason was masterful as Watson. In some ways he upstages Plummer. Another great actor contributing within this movie is Donald Sutherland.

It seems in this day and age where modern day murderers have much out done Jack the Ripper, the public is still intrigued by him. That the case was never solved and he may have been the first well publicized serial killer may have something to do with that.

This movie merges several of the most popular theories as to who the Ripper was and his possible motives into one. The names and characters were real. The story teller offers this as what could have been. Fiction yes, but good fiction based on actual events with actual persons at the time of the case.

As I stated, this movie is not well known and if you own it you will be able to share an excellent thriller with friends that never knew it existed.

I do like the expanded attention to Watson, fattening his part with inessential grace notes that Mason handles with his usual mastery--a sort of competent Nigel-Bruce-Watson in this rendering.  But transforming Holmes into a sentimentalist who actually weeps at the predicaments in his investigation is a let down.  It's interesting to see this film's version as a contrast to the Edwardian melodrama mode Brett exploited in the television series, but Plummer's Holmes is too much of a mensch.  It's a courageous but misguided attempt to make the role his own.

Perhaps I would have been more tolerant of the characterizations had the pacing overall been less leaden.  The opening sequence sets off the alarm, as the upper gallery v. middle-class receptions to the arrival of royalty lumbers on far too long.  Throughout, other instances of vague decisions by the director, repetitive pov tracking shots down deserted alleys, and lazy editing of what COULD have been tightly exciting scenes diminish the impact of this cautious misadventure.",1152748800,10,1285,5.056872037914692

211220,4,6300147444,"Although not based on anything written by Arthur Conan Doyle, Murder by Decree is both one of the best Sherlock Holmes movies and it is THE best Jack the Ripper movie ever made.  The conspiracy theory that this movie puts forth should be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the Jack the Ripper story.  It is basically the same plot as in From Hell.  This is a much better movie than From Hell (although that graphic novel is one of the best of all time).
It is inevitable that someone would pit Holmes against Jack the Ripper sooner or later.  Holmes made his literary debut around the same time as the Ripper, but Conan Doyle never put him on the case (because Sherlock would have to SOLVE the case and, of course, the Ripper's identity is still a mystery).  In this version, fictional characters like Lestrade mingle with real-life characters like Sir Charles Warren - historically, a man whose incompetence hindered the capture of the Ripper.  At this point in history, Holmes and Watson would have been comparatively young men at the start of their careers.  Christopher Plummer (Holmes) and James Mason (Watson) are middle-aged and elderly, respectively.  However, both actors are so fine that it is a pleasure to watch them act.  James Mason - an underappreciated actor today - brings the dignity to Watson that Conan Doyle bequeathed him (this character is usually played as a dunce for comic relief).  Christopher Plummer plays a humanist Holmes that would have been a tad unfamiliar to Conan Doyle - at one point, Holmes breaks down in tears, something the literary character would NEVER do.  Even though Basil Rathbone will always own the part, Plummer plays him as a real person and not a caricature.
The movie was directed by Bob Clark, whose most famous film is A Christmas Story (I won't mention Porky's here).  However, he also directed the greatest ""the calls are coming from inside the house!"" movie, Black Christmas.  Here we see the same techniques as he employs the fish-eye lens to show the twisted POV of the killer.  Unlike other directors, he holds this perspective even during the murder.
I've taken the Jack the Ripper tour and seen this area in real life - although now it is almost unrecognizable.  This film does a good job of re-creating the look and feel of the gloomy East End of Victorian England all those years ago.",1079740800,6,2354,4.735294117647059

Irrespective of whether you believe this to be the `solution' to the Ripper mystery (based on Stephen Knights' book `The Final Solution'), this film is the best version of the Ripper story to date in covering most of the established facts as well as setting the story in the context of the concern in Victorian England at the time with the rise of the Radicals. This is down to the intelligent screenplay by John Hopkins (whose script for Sidney Lumet's `The Offence' was one of Sean Connery's best films) who cleverly makes sure that every scene conveys at least one piece of information to help set the story in its proper context.
If that isn't enough, this film also possesses a wonderful eerie atmosphere by the bucketloads thanks to Harry Pottle's sets, Judy Moorcroft's costumes, Carl Zittrer and Paul Zaza's music and Reg Morris' photography (especially the distorted wide angle shots portraying the first person view of the Ripper). Of course anyone who has seen Bob Clark's earlier `Black Christmas' will recognise the same directorial flourishes which Clark uses here. It is hard to believe that Clark's later career was marked by such films as `Porky's' and its ilk as he shows such a great touch here that he should have continued to make films like this rather than the teen comedies which he is best known for. The sense of unease which the music and the camerawork in particular bring to this film is seldom seen elsewhere (the aforementioned `Black Christmas' and Bernard Rose's `Candyman' are the only examples that come to mind that I am aware of) which make for genuinely uncomfortable viewing.
If it wasn't for Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke's great television portrayal of Holmes and Watson, I would argue that Christopher Plummer and James Mason also manage to create the definitive portrayal of the great detective and his trusty assistant. Certainly theirs is the best film portrayal (although I retain a great fondness for Robert Stephens and Colin Blakely in Billy Wilder's `The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' which is a slightly more comic tale). Mason in particular avoids the trap of making Watson the cretinous sidekick which certain other versions have essayed (particular the Basil Rathbone versions which I can't believe are regarded as definitive by so many people). The warm friendship between the two is a particular highlight of this version.
Praise be to Anchor Bay who have released the DVD of this great film with a 124 minute version which seems to feature extended scenes which I have not seen previously.

(UK/Canada - 1978)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Whilst investigating a series of murders committed by 'Jack the Ripper' in Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Christopher Plummer) and Dr. Watson (James Mason) uncover a Masonic conspiracy which leads them to the very heart of the British Establishment.

During the summer of 1973, the BBC ran a six-part documentary series entitled ""Jack the Ripper"" (also known as ""The Ripper File""), in which two popular fictional detectives (played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor) investigated the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper, using all the evidence available to them at the time. Their conclusions formed the basis of Bob Clark's all-star period thriller MURDER BY DECREE, which condenses vast amounts of information into a single digestible screenplay.

A British/Canadian co-production, the film's lavish recreation of Victorian London (extravagant opera houses, cobbled streets and miles of gloomy Whitechapel alleyways populated by hundreds of costumed extras) belies its modest $4m budget, and for once, the starry supporting cast - including Anthony Quayle, David Hemmings, John Gielgud and Donald Sutherland - seem perfectly suited to their individual roles. For the most part, Clark subordinates his deceptively simple visual style to a wealth of evidence which constitutes the heart and soul of John Hopkins' detailed screenplay. In particular, director and writer outline the political and class divisions which prevailed in England at the time of the Ripper murders, exacerbating a number of problems surrounding the police investigation and leading to all manner of conspiracy theories which persist to this day. However, the script contains a number of memorable character touches (the episode of the 'errant pea' is most prized by the movie's many fans) which prevents the narrative from becoming bogged down in a series of facts and figures. Plummer and Mason are ideally suited to the roles of Holmes and Watson, though Genevieve Bujold almost steals the film during a heartbreaking sequence in a lonely asylum where Holmes discovers the key to the unfolding mystery.

You may not agree with the film's conclusions (the same evidence was re-evaluated by author Stephen Knight in his popular non-fiction account 'Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution' [1976] and David Wickes' excellent TV movie JACK THE RIPPER [1988] starring Michael Caine), but MURDER BY DECREE is generally ackowledged as one of the best Ripper/Holmes movies ever made.

Incidentally, the film was given a PG rating at a time when the MPAA was allowing some extraordinarily vivid material to go unchecked within this particular category, and while MURDER BY DECREE doesn't revel in violence, it conveys the grislier aspects of the Ripper's crimes with enough borderline potency to warrant a PG-13 these days.",1049328000,16,2881,5.446188340807175

So I am more than open to the movies from 10-20 years ago where the pace was a little more relaxed.  But even having said that, this movie is still TOO slow, and TOO talky.  The cast is fine, though as other people have mentioned James Mason is perhaps 10 years too old for his role.  And a personal pet peeve: it annoys me when you have a period piece film but then the actors have contemporary hair cuts.

After some serious consideration and re-viewing of classic Holmes films, I really believe this to be the absolute best film, of both the Sherlock Holmes character and of the Jack the Ripper story.
I don't need to add to the chorus of people giving synopses of the movie, but I feel compelled to share my glee that this has finally received the class A DVD treatment. I first saw this when it was released theatrically, and managed to catch it a few times over the years on HBO or some other movie channel. I have so many good memories associated with this film. The cast is fantastic (special nod to James Mason and Genevieve Bujold), the ambience and look of the film is exemplary and really takes you to the foggy dank East End of Victorian England. It is spooky, funny, thrilling and pastoral all at once.

I was especially impressed with Christopher Plummer's performance in this movie; possibly his best film role ever.
For years I sought a copy of this movie, only to discover that it had been taken ""out of print;"" I ended up buying scratchy used copies (through Amazon.com auctions)at high prices. So I was delighted when the DVD came out, and plan to share it now with many friends. For anyone who likes Sherlock Holmes, or who just likes movies, this would be a great gift.

  The film postulates the fateful encounter between the Sherlock Holmes/Watson duo (Christopher Plummer & James Mason, both excellent in their roles) and Jack the Ripper, or more accurately, the conspiracy BEHIND Jack the Ripper. The forces, both social and economic, at work in London in the late 1800's are explored fully and to great effect by Director Bob Clark, who is perhaps best known for directing the perennial Holiday Favorite ""A Christmas Story"". A film about Jack the Ripper may seem like an odd fit for Clark, but he handles the film well, and gets some great performances by the cast, including John Gielgud, Frank Finlay, Genvieve Bujold, and Susan Clark; They're all phenomenal in their parts. Plummer's Holmes seems more human than most other cinematic depictions I've seen, and Mason brings an almost unheard-of degree of professionalism and dignity to the oft-maligned role of Watson, who is usually depicted as a bufoon onscreen. The film suffers slightly from a score which doesn't seem to fit the sinister visuals at all; The music is too old-school, and seems to have been lifted from a cheesy 1940's melodrama.
  The DVD comes with an informative booklet, one of my favorite features of Anchor Bay's DVD line. The DVD itself includes commentary by Director Clark, an extensive photo and poster/ad gallery, and Biographies of Clark, Plummer, & Mason. The film transfer is gorgeous, as usual for Anchor Bay.

The screenplay, by John Hopkins, was based on the most recent writings of the time, by ""Ripper scholars"", as to the real identity of Jack the Ripper, an unanswered question that has baffled many.  What makes this film unique is the employment of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, to solve the mystery.  The chase leads to people and places, high and low, accompanied by an excellent musical score. Composers Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer team with director Clark (as they did in 1983's A Christmas Story, based on the humor of Jean Shepherd) for an excellent entertainment.  Perhaps provided by Zittrer, whose credits include a number of films in the horror genre from the early '70's, the film's eerie moments are intensified by the accompanying music.  The film ends on a note of bittersweet resignation and the credits roll, supported by the music heard in the midi file at
[...]
The closing music recapitulates the brighter themes heard throughout the film.  At times hauntingly beautiful, the piece grows from a violin solo played by the character of Sherlock Holmes at story's end.  This music is diatonic and triad-based, always reflecting the sounds of the sea.  Great Britain, its people and land, are never far from the sea, and nowhere is that more clearly represented than in the music associated with it.  Whether written by native orchestral and band composers or by others seeking to evoke a sound and feeling made familiar by associations over time, the sea is always there.",1044489600,7,1690,4.98932384341637
