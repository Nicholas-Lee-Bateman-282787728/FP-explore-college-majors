3829674,4,B001Y44DKY,"MURPHY'S LAW is all of the above and more. I have been watching a lot of British detective shows that I have gotten on DVD. James Nesbitt was in an episode of a TOUCHING EVIL as a rogue reporter. He caught my attention and I looked for more information and read the series MURPHY'S LAW has been created specifically for him and that the show ran severl seasons. Nesbitt has a commendable body of work so I expected this series was worth a look and I was not disappointed.
Again, Nesbitt is a rogue but this time he is Detective Tommy Murphy. Murphy has a tragic secret in his past that has left him emotionally broken. His police superiors need him to solve a series of diamond heists and he gets one more chance.

I enjoyed the quirkiness of Murphy's character. He's dedicated to solving crimes and yet he not stretching the limits of the law himself. He can be patient but never call him Paddy or risk a dose of his anger. Of course, someone is always calling him Paddy, which made me wonder what it would be like for a Northern Irish detective to be working in London.

Murphy is often partnered with Detective Inspector Annie Guthrie--the stunningly beautiful Claudia Harrison. There is obviously a strong attraction between the two and Murphy takes every chance to make that attraction known. They make a great team and that is part of the fun of the show.

The series raised my curiousity a number of times. Murphy normally goes undercover in every episode. He usually keeps the name ""Murphy."" His picture has even been in the paper but yet he easily gains the trust of the criminals. I wondered if he keeps his police salary AND the salary he earns when he is working undercover for the mob. Also, Murphy likes the bottle and is often drunk and can cause a scene. That's certainly not good for a detective who is often undercover.

There is some variety and creativity in the crimes and in the episodes. In KISS AND TELL, Murphy goes undercover and joins an elite fitness club for members looking for extramarital fun. In the last episode of Series 1 called REUNION, Murphy goes undercover again to work for an owner of a SoHo Burlesque club in a street war with a rival. Is murder along with some fun show scenes of beautiful dancers that adds an extra touch.

It was fun to watch the series. There was a couple of times I had to go back and try to understand one line here at there. Murphy sometimes falls strongly into his northern Irish accent but it all adds to the charm of the show.",1314576000,2,2496,4.452954048140044

We arrived at ""Murphy"" after viewing the morass of  ""Cracker."" Though we respect the expansive and emotive Coltrane, the dolorous character stagnated, unlike the driven Murphy. ""Murphy's Law"" wastes no time on theatrical evaluation of criminal psychology.

James Nesbitt completely inhabits the grief-wrought Murphy, a man pushed to the edge in ways few experience. With conviction and wild despair, he becomes a means for justice. Reminds me of Hammett's staccato poetry. I've known fascinating aged ex-criminals, salt of the earth, friends with great stories, as well as law enforcement folks; this show actually understands the dynamics involved. This is one hard intelligent romp, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murphy-s-Law-Series-One/dp/B001Y44DKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murphy's Law: Series One</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murphy-s-Law-Series-Three/dp/B0039ZF8BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murphy's Law: Series Three</a>. For connoisseurs of crime/suspense drama, Season Three is over the top great; snappy and tight, with crisp writing and great momentum. At this point, James Nesbitt stepped in to contribute creative direction, propelling the show to another level. Season Two is not as good, but Season Three is an intense fantastic run, due to Nesbitt's superb story ideas and acting. Throughout, James Nesbitt inhabits the role of Murphy perfectly, stretched tight across a harsh life. Nesbitt is also superb in the revival of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jekyll/dp/B000QXDEH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jekyll</a>.

3829676,5,B001Y44DKY,"I can't possibly imagine anyone but James Nesbitt playing Murphy - he does it with such ease!
He is so believable, you forget you are watching a movie and think it's a documentary on crime in the UK.
I think the English do this type of TV drama better than anyone - and this series backs that statement.
It is gritty and raw - violent at times, but certainly in context with Murphy's work as an undercover cop.  You may find Murphy's Irish accent a bit hard to undestand at first, but soon get used to it. James Nesbitt has won many awards for his television work - deservedly so.
The supporting actors are top notch - I recommend this series highly.
Definitely one for crime buffs.",1289088000,,682,4.3700787401574805

3829678,5,B001Y44DKY,"MURPHY'S LAW just couldn't be done better by anyone else. I waited years for this to be released for Region (1). AMAZON IS THE BEST! They even emailed me when OCCUPATION (a recent BBCTV movie with James Nesbitt starring) was going to show. This being because I had MURPHY'S LAW on my wishlist. So now I have my own copy of ...LAW. I already knew I had to have it, as it aired on BBC a few years back. I was impressed and determined. It wasn't even available in Region (2) at that time. James is the best Murphy there could ever be. He's just got that character.
I'm now awaiting the Region (1) release of the dynamic BBCTV series COLD FEET-Season 4. Series 1-3 are out and I have them! All you have to do is search for COLD FEET and you can watch the pilot. You will crack up and want to buy all you can get. The line up is chock full of talent, but James is the star by far! He's beautifully Irish but thank God the BBC loves him too.",1258329600,10,935,4.059459459459459

3829680,5,B001Y44DKY,"Yes, ya just gotta love that Northern Irish brogue in this earthy London cop, a transplant from Belfast. The DVD set is the first season including the pilot of the series ""Murphy's Law"" that continued then for several years. Although this Series 1 consists of what is called 5 episodes, each episode is 90-minutes, feature-length, movies, each with it's own cop/mystery/crime story. Only the occasional overlap, & that's due to about 5 main characters. Episodes are thrillers, packed with action, suspense, and each ends with a twist unexpected. The truly spectacular aspect of ""Murphy's Law: Series One"" is the number of times you end up belly-laughing at comical one-liners, usually being spit out by Murphy, and usually at a moment when he should have been mum. All the ingredients of 5-stars for British Mystery fans.

DS Tommy Murphy (James Nesbitt) is the undercover cop with a haunting past, a rugged body that takes abuse frequently, a mind always a step ahead of the people around him (be they the low-life he's undercover to investigate or other coppers), and he's funny.  He has a smart mouth, quick wit that generally opens with a biting comment at just the wrong time, getting himself a fist or other injury, or when he's getting close to a romantic moment, which usually ices all inspiration.

DI Annie Gutherie (Claudia Harrison) plays his boss, beautiful, available--except to Murphy--who tries (bless his heart). Beautiful! That lass.
Carter, another copper, is a regular as is Father McBride, an old friend of Murphy's who tries to help, but usually compounds an ordeal.

Oh yes, and Murphy has a wife, from Belfast, who periodically shows up in the stories, unannounced, unwelcome, and helps dredge up that secret past that Murphy is running away from. I will not be spoiler of the secret here.

Did I tell you how funny this tough street-smart undercover cop can be?

The DVD set has subtitles, but are seldom needed for the accents. Episodes are arranged in a different order than the order originally aired on British TV, BBC, in 2003. It makes no difference because this set is like getting five great suspense packed movies in one set. A value! Bonus includes Nesbitt's bio and filmography.  Not a rated DVD, but fights and murder scenes don't spare the blood. You get death, maiming, blackmail, smuggling, drugs, nightclubs, robbery, kidnapping, hangings, fighting, all that regular PG/R stuff, plus comedy.

Since it's not a saga, 5 individual episode reviews are necessary.
MURPHY'S LAW PILOT: Murphy has a past with an undisclosed secret he'd rather forget but a medal came with it. The award seems to have bought him one last chance as an undercover cop.  It's drugs, murders, diamonds, undertaking, robbery, racketeering, oriental traffic, and danger compounded.  Of course there's a ""bad"", ""beautiful"", woman, Annie, with her own secret.  Murphy flings funny one-liners around faster than flying bullets.

ELECTRIC BILL:  Kate Jennings, London magazine publisher, is kidnapped by infamous 'napper ""Electric Bill.""  Electric Bill is apprehended through a routine traffic stop but denies knowledge of Kate.  PI Annie, in charge of the case, puts Murphy into Elec. Bill's cell, undercover as a felon, to discover Kate's secret location.  It is serious business.  But never can Murphy cut off the ""smart mouth"" which adds loads of comedy in the midst of dark suspense.  That's Murphy's Law--a comedy/crime thriller, every time.  Only the DVD viewer is laughing, however.

KISS & TELL: An arms dealer escapes arrest and stalks Murphy to get even for his undercover part of the near capture.  Meanwhile, men are being murdered through a health club connection.  Murphy is required to go undercover at the club where rich males and females do more than get healthy.  Murphy smiles.  Murphy thinks naughty thoughts.  Murphy must try getting involved with blonds who might be the killer.  Between shower rooms, saunas, pools, and tubs; it's hard to keep a-breast of the clues.

MANIC MUNDAY: Murphy is excited to be assigned undercover bodyguard for his hometown (Belfast)snooker legend, Mickey Munday, while playing in London.  Murphy's also excited because Annie is working undercover with him. He really loves undercover with Annie, especially when they must pose as married. Murphy puts a few snickers into a world snooker match even when an Irish terrorist group tires to fix the game.  Family ties threaten a bloody end to this pool hall trick.  Right on cue, Murphy chalks up another, as always, his way, not the expected approved method.

REUNION: Another east London gang fronting night clubs has a family member shot. Is it revenge?  Murphy is working undercover in this gang but needs female help to prevent an all-out street war.  Annie joins the undercover gang, working hand-in-hand with Murphy again. Beautiful Annie the bouncer? Another killing raises the danger for the undercover duo.  Who is killing who and causing the gangster conflict to escalate?  In the midst of the worst, Murphy can yet slip off a wise crack.

According to the internet, there were many more years, and many more episodes of Murphy's Law. It's so good, I sure hope more get converted to DVD for the British TV Mystery, Crime, Suspense, (and even comedy) fans.

The London Evening Standard called it ""A thriller with amusing edges.""
So true. Recommended with no reservations.
Sorry about the length of this review, no other way to do this set of 5 movies in one box.",1253318400,16,5480,5.035476718403547
3829681,5,B001Y44DKY,"That series works on a simple but extremely effective formula. The first characteristic is that there is only one plot going on, one investigation, as opposed to most American, and even French, detective series. That enables the episodes to go into detail a lot more and delve into intricate elements of psychology or economic interest, especially since the episodes are about one hour and thirty minutes, twice as long as standard episodes of detective series.. The second interest is that crime is always stated as being some kind of business. And that is fundamental. We think of crime as being asocial or antisocial. It is in a way, but not because it wants to disrupt and destroy society, but because it plays the rules of society in order to get an easy profit out of it. Easy? Way of speaking. Fast for sure. The pilot episode takes us into the business of undertaking and shows how that business can easily become a cover for another deadly and lethal business: heroin in exchange of diamonds, or vice versa if you prefer. ""Electric Bill"" is beautifully wrapped up so that the first suspect will be revealed as the culprit but after a long hesitating line of exploration and digging out. But this serial killer is only someone who is preparing the big case with little ones so that he is sure the target will pay because he will be frightened. Serial killing as an efficient business procedure. ""Kiss and Tell"" is funnier because a spa center is transformed into a hunting ground for a female serial killer who is only getting a lot of money out of some rich men who are looking for sexual variety and killing them when she gets the real prize. ""Manic Munday"" shows that sports, in that case snooker, are nothing but a business but with a lot of ""agreements"" and ""contracts"" that are little legal but much profitable for the manipulator. And you can always win when you use kidnapping and killing as a pressurizing argument. Finally ""Reunion"" shows how some of the clubbing and gambling business in Soho, London, are nothing but born bullies and that they are totally lost when some violence comes against them from an unknown source, when the bully becomes the prey of a vulture. Then you discover these bullies succeeded only because they killed or took advantage of the right person at the right moment in the right place to recuperate some business leverage. But when he is cornered, what's more in public he will only wet his pants, beg and cry. He will become what he always was: a capricious, whimsical child overcompensating some environmental problem by terrorizing his surroundings in order to avoid tears and wet under-wears, if not beds. But the best element of this series - and I will try to put my hand on the subsequent seasons - is that the main police investigator is systematically undercover among the criminals he is supposed to arrest sooner or later. That undercover element makes the dealing with the crime different, more interesting, more intimate even, and it is good to feel intimate with criminals: that may reassure you because criminals are just plain ordinary men and women who just want to make some dough fast. It is also true James Nesbitt is a hell of a cool investigator, as cold as an unmelting iceberg in the furnace of an incinerator.

It's a great series and James Nesbitt is great fun to watch.  He really gets into his characters.  UK crime shows are so much better than American crime shows.

8348056,3,B001Y44DKY,"I bought this, much on the basis of ""Cold Feet"" and ""Monroe.""

He is an unlikable character (this is probably intentional).  The general plot of these first two episodes were easy to follow; the details of the cases were quite a bit more difficult.  I know that there was some humor, and I think I laughed once.

I seem to recall that the character Murphy loves to say ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" a great deal.  For me, that is annoying.

I made the mistake of ordering the whole series.  I am not sure at this time if I will complete watching it or not.",1467676800,,547,4.252427184466019
