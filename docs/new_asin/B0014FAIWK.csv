8255662,4,B0014FAIWK,"Not a bad compilation of shows. The sarah silverman program is the best show on this dvd, but there is only one episode. You could probably get stoned out of your mind and watch the rest of them. There is an educational video about marijuana that is pretty funny and they even included an episode of painting with Bob Ross. So I bought this dvd for 2 or 3 bucks and it was worth what I spent on it. I totally wouldn't spend more than that on it though. If you don't like shows like the Sarah Silverman Program then you probably shouldn't buy this",1263340800,5,546,4.20952380952381
