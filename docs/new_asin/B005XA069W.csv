4902433,5,B005XA069W,"I was just going to buy the 3rd and 4th seasons of the shows because they were the only two I hadn't seen, but I changed my mind. I wanted all 4 seasons on DVD so I can enjoy them all. I've seen this entire season on TV once and it was great watching it again. So many changes from season 1 it's crazy. Everything looks different. Huge Lyoko fan!",1357776000,,346,3.9571428571428573

Super awesome! Item brand new and excellent condition. A+",1357430400,,129,4.2
4902435,5,B005XA069W,"I have been watching this ever since I was little and it was, for a time, the only thing I ever watched on TV. now it's on DVD and I love it. It is about a group of teens who go in to fight a virus on a super computer named X.A.N.A and stop it from coming out and taking over the world. This season does not vary much from the first season, but it is still really awesome. The only thing that has really changed is that new characters are introduced and a few of the hero's get new powers. Now I do have to say there are two cons to consider here:

1)The show does get  quite repetitive at times. there is very little change in the main objective to each episode though the objective does change slightly with the next season and a lot with the last two.

2)These videos are printed on DVD-R disks. That means that some DVD players will not be able to play these disks. be sure to know your DVD player and it's limits before buying this.

Overall, I have to say that if your into anime and don't mind the fast talking, repetitive nature, and love computers and science fiction; then this show is a must have.",1352505600,,1108,4.1157407407407405
4902436,5,B005XA069W,I saw code lyoko on tv but never saw the ending so i decided to buy the whole series this is season 2,1350345600,,101,3.4347826086956523
4902437,5,B005XA069W,"A fantastic animated show filled with action, drama, romance and comedy perfectly blended to create so many memorable moments.
This season kicks it up a notch, hitting you with loads of new plot points in the first two episodes with revelations galore throughout.",1332201600,,263,5.1395348837209305
4902438,5,B005XA069W,"**This review is meant for those wondering whether they should purchase this season or not**

1. The episodes look EXACTLY like they did when they aired on Cartoon Network.
2. The artwork on the DVD cover/discs are NOT faded.
3. Each disc has its own holder.
4. There are 6 discs.
5. The language is English - There are no subtitles or other languages.
6. Not once did I see any sort of pixellation or degradation of quality. I'm VERY impressed with this set, and the first season.
7. Kids can watch this anime, but adults can as well. I started watching this series when it was out in 2003 (13 years old) and I still watch it. I've been searching for this series on DVD for YEARS. Now I'm 21 and I've been watching it every night since I've had it. :)

Side note: I was a bit nervous about buying all four seasons of Code Lyoko when I saw the DVD-R disclaimer. I'm glad I took the chance though, because I couldn't be more thrilled or impressed with how they turned out. :)

If you are deciding whether it's worth the risk: IT IS!",1330819200,,1031,4.25
4902439,4,B005XA069W,"Like many of you wondering about this product, I too got the Funimation season 1 back when it was released 5+ years ago and then got totally screwed over when they only released five episodes (1 disc, which does correspond to the first disc in this set) of season 2 and just quit at that. So I was quite excited to see these sets! However, never having bought anything that was DVD-R print on demand (btw, the discs all have a purple disc surface, much like if you were to buy a stack of DVD-Rs), I had to take a bit of a risk. For a physical description of the product, I took some pictures that can be seen on the related images page, but while it is minimalistic in terms of disc and box artwork, the DVD case is nicely done, the discs don't feel like they're going to fall out or anything, quite secure. I wish all 6 disc case holders came in these.

Now on to how the video is, which is what you are probably most curious about. For the most part, the video quality on the eps is good, most certainly better than the quality on On Demand (even on the same episodes) but every so often, some glitches will arise. Stuff like occasional pixilation occurs in quite a few episodes and some general screen glitches that were definitely not part of the original episodes, stuff like part of one frame lingering on for a second into the next frames when they clearly shouldn't be there or some glitch looking lines that only laster a second at most. They do seem to happen at least once a disc (some discs more than others, though often in the intro where it's hard to care), but if you're a fan of the show, odds are it's not enough to ruin it for you. I had no problem with the sound (unless it went along with a visual glitch, most of the time it did not). These visual glitches may be in part because I have the world's pickiest DVD player, I cleaned off a few of the discs (even though they look like new, just to make doubly sure) and visual glitches did improve if not outright disappear. I put in disc 4 and had a visual glitch on the menu (part of the intro's first frame showed up on the menu), cleaning the disc fixed that though (and even that didn't stop the menu from working perfectly). None of the episodes ever stopped playing because of said occasional glitches, so it may be the source material used for the discs.

The menu starts up immediately upon the disc loading (no pesky previews!) and there is the default play all option or you can select an episode. It's very basic but it gets the job done. There are no chapters, if you hit to skip, it will go to the next episode. There are no extras. Unlike Funimation's season 1, all of the episodes are actually in order this time. I did not get a chance to try out the DVDs in my laptop, though a friend of mine said his season 3 worked in his computer.

For those of you who already bought the series on iTunes, it's probably not worth the double dip unless you really want it on DVD, but for fans waiting since Funimation released season 1, the price more than justifies the set as long as you don't mind a few visual hiccups.",1328140800,8,3095,4.233502538071066
4902440,5,B005XA069W,"The episodes are in great clarity!

4902442,5,B005XA069W,This is the best season of Code Lyoko. There is less filler episodes and more plot development. If you are a fan of cartoons or anime give this one a try.,1319760000,,154,4.0
4902443,4,B005XA069W,Can't wait to see the next season. I only wish that they would never end. Why text friends when I can watch this. LOL,1394323200,,117,3.9166666666666665

4902448,5,B005XA069W,I remember watching this show all the time. I haven't heard or watched it in a long time.(I rememered the opening though) I can't believe this is how they sounded. I don't remember their voices being so annoying. Annoying voices are a real turn off for me but if you haven't seen this series  don't take my opinion about their voices. This is one of the greatest shows ever.,1377475200,,374,4.420289855072464

The series takes you from beginning to end so that means that whatever happens in one episode is built upon in the next episode. Its smart,it has a good pace & it's funny.
