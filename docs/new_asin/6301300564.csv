If you are a fan of over the top, craptastic 80's action/horror films starring Lyle Alzado and Clayton Rohner, you are in luck. If you are a fan of complex character development, intelligent dialogues, and breathtaking cinematography, you need to lower your standards by 78% to enjoy this classic.",1446854400,,417,4.573333333333333

7811044,1,6301300564,"Well what do you expect when you get an ex, pro football player hopped up on steroids, who cant act to star in a movie. Lyle Alzado(RIP) stars as a demented convict who is left locked up in MSP after the prison has closed down. When a low budjet film crew decides to shoot a ""convict women"" type movie, Lyle breaks out and all hell breaks loose. The only positive part of this movie is that Lyle has almost no lines, so you only have to deal with a dissfunctional plot. I dunno, it may become a cult classic. Its a real stinker though. It tries to be a horror movie but fails misserably when all you do is laugh at the bad production. It has some full frontal nudity, for some the only redeeming quality.",996364800,8,704,4.1838235294117645
