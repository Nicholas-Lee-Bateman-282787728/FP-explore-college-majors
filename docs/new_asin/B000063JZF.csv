1690302,5,B000063JZF,"The cover of this DVD is, well, eye-catching.  It is a very good story containing a 25 year old dude that has a very good eye for women.  He gets cought in a lot of stuff but always comes out ok.  This is not a porno, or really that bad at all.  it does show some nudity and the bouncieness (if you know what I mean, haha). The anime is a very good watch and a suggest you get it.",1029110400,,380,3.7125
1690303,5,B000063JZF,"FIRST OFF THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS! AS YOU CAN SEE AS IT'S RATING IS 17+ BUT, IF YOUR NOT A KID THIS IS HILARIOUS!
The story is about a boy (Kintaro Oe) well, a 25 year old one but hey he seems that way in the show. well anyway this is about a boy who is a freeter, a freeter is a person who travels around doing part-time jobs (odd-jobs). and while he is freetering he comes across jobs, and every job he gets involves girls. If you cath my drift you now realize why it's rated 17+ (FAN SERVICE).
The first episode is about when he gets a job at a computer programing company and guess what? everyone who works there is a women and the boss is the particular women that this story is partially about, well I don't want to ruin the ending, although they all end the same! I will leave you there and move on to the second episode.
The second episode is about when he gets a job on campaigning for a governer and guess what girl is involved in this episode? NO not his wife you perv. His daughter! his daughter is a malicious and controlling girl, you get the rest.
The third episode is about when he gets a job at a noodle shop and the girl involved in this one is the noodle shop's owners daughter, she is a very nice, good hearted girl. Now your thinking what could be wrong with this? well she might about to mary a rich man who is only marying her for some deal with someone for alot of mony and then divorce her, and Kintaro has to stop this! Oh yeah did i mention she's a virgin and this is her first love?
Well that about wraps things up, I hope that if you purchase this DVD you enjoy it, trust me it's worth the $26.98!",1029110400,,1623,4.027863777089784
1690304,2,B000063JZF,"... This show has little in the view of a story and that fact that it is episodical makes it difficult for me to empathize with the main character whom I do not know because of a lack of background.
This show sticks to a strict formula.  The main guy gets a new Job, meets a ...chick, enchants her until she gets hot for him, leaves job and never scores (probably a good thing).
I think horney guys are funny.  I love Urusei Yatsura, but this show didn't do it for me and frankly the nipples in the first episode disturbed me.  This is not one for the kiddies and not smart enough for the grownups.
I give this 5 stars for dippy teenage fun.
For me this Anime is right on level with Ruroni Kenshin, Kite, Cowboy Bebop, Dominion Tank Police and Green legend Ran. It is a copy of better, more original Anime.",1023235200,,806,4.187096774193549
1690305,5,B000063JZF,"If your a true anime nut like me , you love this movie. From start to finish you`ll laugh untill you cry. I cant wait untill the whole set comes out on DVD & if your a guy, You will wish you could be Kintaro Oe In real life, in other words BUY THE MOVE !!!",1020384000,,256,3.5892857142857144
1690306,5,B000063JZF,Kintaro Oe is a 25 year old freeter as he calls himself.  this is an anime about men and the way their minds work towards women they like or have sexual feelings about!  I am female and I loved it I thought it was hilarious!!!  WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!,1016064000,2,247,4.104166666666667
7959248,4,B000063JZF,"I had the chance to watch the complete anime series on Youtube and I have to say I had mixed emotions about it. At first I thought this show was going to be one of those lame crappy love stories but I really thought wrong, also I thought of how Kintaro was an idiot or how much of a goofball he is. Either way, this whole anime series kept me on the edge of my seat and also forced me to yell at the computer screen and laugh out loud. In this series, the have the major laughs,the usual perverted humour,and hot chicks. Now if you are not into stuff that is perverted...this anime is not for you because in this series they have nip-slips,panty shots,and more. To me, this series is worth the money and I am going to buy it right away.",1155081600,,736,4.118055555555555
7959249,5,B000063JZF,"Golden boy's animation slightly turns you off it at first, it's not horrible and it's not fantastic either and it makes the first episode look uninteresting at first. All I can say is don't stop watching. The story is ridiculous and hilarious and it gives you the definition of irony. A young 25 year old boy whose main goal is to learn all he can about life by taking a number of temp jobs and taking notes on people's behavior. He goes through six of these adventures in all, and all of them invariably contain a girl that is always attractive and always captures Kintaro's attention and usually causes him lots of trouble. What's funny is that none of the girls really like him until they find out he is really more than what he first appears to be. He always has his bike and a girl chasing him as he leaves for the next adventure.",1137542400,,835,4.358974358974359
7959250,5,B000063JZF,Golden boy is so funny. It's adult type funny but great video overall. There is not much to be said by me because the dvd speaks for itself.,1136592000,,140,4.035714285714286
7959251,3,B000063JZF,"Golden Boy: Treasure Hunt: Volume 1 is an ok series.  This is heavy ecchi with lots and lots of fanservice.  The plot is  disappointingly predictable so far.  Kintaro is a 25 year-old law college dropout, who bicycles around Japan looking for adventure, writing observations and life lessons in his ubiquitous notebook.  It sounds like a good premise, however once we know the twist revealed in the first episode, each subsequent episode has the same twist and is no longer exciting.

Iwata Mitsuo breathes life into this boring series.  Mitsuo voices Kintaro, with so much energy and a rapid delivery of lines, that he is like a Japanese Martin Short.  The opening is the slowest and most boring I have ever seen in any anime.  Reading manga is faster.

Treasure Hunt contains episodes one through three: ""Computer Lesson,"" ""Temptation of the Maiden,"" and ""Danger! The Virgin's First Love.""",1122595200,,891,5.0
7959252,5,B000063JZF,"Absolutely one of the most hilarious animes I have ever seen.  One could compare it to a Excel Saga with more plot.  I can watch it about once every week, which I can't with most episode animes.  This is a must buy, and a sin not to see it once.",1062806400,,245,3.86
7959253,5,B000063JZF,"Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.
One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions. He spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less then 0.1 seconds his face will turn not just serious, but manga-fighter-style life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record. It's hilarious.
If that wasn't enough, the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything. The one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like American Pie, you'll love this.

7959254,5,B000063JZF,"This is the story of Kintaro Oe. He's a 25 year old graduate of Tokyo University law school. But he dropped out before receiving his degree. He is now a ""freeder"", one who moves from job to job. He is one of those ""lovable loser"" types. In this first disk, he works as a janitor for a  all female computer software company, works on the campaign for a crocked mayor while tutoring the mayor's sultry late-teenage daughter, Nyoko. And saving a noodle shop owners daughter from marrrying the wrong man.
The animation isn't the best, however, Kintaro's facial expressions will keep you rolling. The female characters are VERY well animated. It is very well written, and very funny for those who enjoy these off the wall humor. You should also get the second disk in the set, which continues Kintaro's misadventures. I personally wished the series would have lasted longer than it did. It's a great buy.",1052265600,,899,4.726114649681529
7959255,5,B000063JZF,"What a great set!!  Volume 2 definitely wrapped up all the unfinished endings.  You must get both volumes to fully enjoy this series.
Once you see the first episode, you will totally be hooked.  The series kinda makes me think of the movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  Kintaro definitely gets the best of everyone.  He has inspired me to learn more and more.
I'll keep this short.  I just started with Anime, and I loved this set.  I laughed my [butt] off from beginning to end...and so will you.",1039219200,,493,4.534090909090909
