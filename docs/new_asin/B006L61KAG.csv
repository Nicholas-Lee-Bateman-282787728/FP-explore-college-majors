5002282,5,B006L61KAG,"I thought this was actually a very good film. As stated in other reviews it definitely had a lot of twists. I felt it was great and told the story of so many young people. I myself know individuals who are ""treacherous"" & they did a great job with this film. I suggest everyone sees it & tell your friends about it!!",1341014400,5,316,4.112903225806452

This has got to be the best movie I have seen in a long time. Very good acting. Everyone should see this movie because it tells the truth about situations people go through in relationships.

So many twist and turns and different avenues. Just when you thought you had it figured out, she hits you with another twist. Look out for this lady for she is up and coming, and has arrived.

5002362,5,B006L61KAG,Great film. Although not a high budget production this film has a great plot and some great acting.  The acting actually gets emotional and very truthful at some points.  If you don't like independent black cinema you may not like it but I thought it a great breakdown into the psychology of some people's behavior.  This movie has a message that throws the consequences of dishonesty and the power of forgiveness into your face.  Great movie in my opinion.,1455667200,,457,4.746835443037975

5002371,3,B006L61KAG,Actors and Actresses were not too bad for an independent film. I thought Corey was pregnant with Justice baby. The movie had potential. It came off a little ghetto though could have been better.,1452124800,,194,4.735294117647059

5002373,3,B006L61KAG,"Unlike others, I think both female leads have great looks and were good actresses with potential. They were especially good at quick-changing and subtle expressions. Darien, too is a good actor. Though the story tried to bring out the depth of friendships over betrayal, it falls short of a good story. Nothing is told or shown as to how the first four years could even happen to make the story believable throughout; the ending as well - not only not believable, but why at all?. All the main characters are players in one sense or another but only one gets the blame. Ridiculous plot. On a film note: it could have been a better film and given the story more credibility if it had not used flashbacks and did some character building instead. The last flashback killed the movie if you bother to watch it. There are far too many lengthy and unnecessary scenes. Sage, being such a beautiful woman has both her looks and her acting diminished by the choices of whomever is responsible for her hair style....I mean it's that bad. As for twists and turns people mention? There was only one and this too abrupt and at the end. If you like to view movies to watch people breaking into the film business practice ""acting"", this is a good one. The what and what-not to dos, for that it is interesting.",1450483200,5,1294,4.534188034188034

5002428,4,B006L61KAG,"Treacherous no doubts reminds me of any tragedy of french poet of the 17th century Jean Racine who, through the plight of his characters tried to show the eternal struggle between our feelings and what our reason tells us to do and us finally succombing to our feelings. The drama that unfolds between the two main female characters in this movie is universal in its essence and also timeless: a woman falls in love and have a prolonged relationship with the boyfriend of her best friend even though her reason commands her to do otherwise. Tiffany Ashley's character (the friend who ""sleeps"" with her best friend's boyfriend) is not without reminding about the internal struggle that the female character Phdre - from the tragedy play of french tragedian Jean Racine - was having when she discovered that she (Phdre) had fallen in love for her stepson. Director and writer JanaMorea Bradley, as the story unfolds, reveals gradually that Jasmine Barnes' character (who plays the victim) is not the saint that we might think. Director and writer JanaMorea Bradley, through that story had created a universe where the characters breathe each other's air but at the same time don't know the real face behind the mask that they see; and the only fine line between that story and a tragedy from Jean Racine is the absence of a bloodbath.

I am looking forward to Director and writer JanaMorea Bradley's next movie in which she will bring actors as talented as the ones she brought in Treacherous but more convincing in their plays and images that are more terrific and lighting and a photograph more superb. I am already salivating...with my eyes :)",1431302400,,1644,4.850533807829182

5002437,2,B006L61KAG,"The reason I gave this movie a low rating, its not because of the story plot. It was the acting!

""Treacherous"" (the winner) was my last choice since I usually avoid titles like this.  From the opening monologue to the end, I was totally engaged.  Great suspenseful  storyline, without negative African American stereotypes, no drug dealers, rappers, people flipping in church...just a good well thought out  story with several themes and lessons.  Acting was good too.",1430092800,,483,5.2894736842105265

5002450,3,B006L61KAG,I am a fan of film. Especially African American film. Every film is not going to be top budget because you have to start somewhere to get to that point. I enjoyed watching things unfold in this story. I like things that are realistic in nature and this is more than possible... triflin' as hell but possible. lol... I think it is worth watching if you are a true film lover. I have seen a few of the actors/actresses in other films and enjoy their work. Its nice to follow some of them as their careers build.,1426377600,,509,4.257731958762887

IT CONTAINED UNNECESSARY FLASH BACK SCENES THAT SEEMED TACKED ON TO EXPLAIN A CHARACTER'S DECEITFUL, PROMISCUOUS BEHAVIOR, BUT ADDED LITTLE TO THE STORY. THE DIALOGUE WAS PREDICTABLE. ONLY ONE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THINGS HAD MORALS; EVERYBODY WAS CHEATING AND THE ENDING WAS JUST TOO NEAT AND TIDY CONSIDERING ALL THE BACK STABBING AND DECEIT THAT WENT ON. I HAVE YET TO SEE A REALLY GOOD MOVIE IN THIS GENRE, ON AMAZON.
