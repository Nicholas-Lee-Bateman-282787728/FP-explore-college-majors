3936665,5,B002ILRCCS,This fine actor takes this to near the top of the many versions of this classic story. I would rank this with the Alistair Sim and Reginald Owen movies.,1392854400,4,152,4.275862068965517

8371014,5,B002ILRCCS,"I loved him in this movie (George C. Scott) but my dvds came shipped in bubble envelope delivered by local post and had the usual tire tread marks on envelope and looked like something heavy (probably truck) dented in the cases. I did not unwrap them as this is clear red flag item might not play well after that treatment, so returned both this and Patrick Stewart version of Christmas Carol. I love these actors in this role, wonderful movie, but seems we cannot get them unscathed lately. I enjoy these classic Christmas movies even when needing a lift during the year not just at holiday time. It's a Wonderful Life is also uplifting always and I want to tell everyone how wonderful these films are if they have never seen them. I just was unable to enjoy them as they came damaged evidently. I am hoping if we mention it enough something will change in packaging/shipping or in the way items are treated by the carriers. I take such good care of my collection of movies/music and wish everyone would take same care in handling items they are in charge of delivering. Why treat things rough when just as easy to handle with care. Love the movies though.  SaraBeth",1424390400,,1167,4.557142857142857

8371017,5,B002ILRCCS,"Love this George C. Scott version of this story. It is a seasonal favorite and only surpassed, in our opinion, by the Alistair Sim version. If you don't like black and white movies, then the George C. Scott color version will be your best choice by far! We try to watch one or both every Christmas season!",1418083200,2,305,4.368421052631579
