8711316,5,B00VUIPDGC,"Contains episodes 5~9 from Winx Club Season 6 in German.
Widescreen aspect ratio yes, and of course Bloomix fairies.

It's so good to have season 6 DVDs to my import collection because the Italian version on DVD is not available in retail, so the German or French version will do. Stella and Musa made me buy it!

Even though these episodes are German dubbed, the video angle appears to be the English footage previously seen on Nickelodeon some 2 years ago, but the episode title cards are German narrated.",1437523200,,507,4.685393258426966
