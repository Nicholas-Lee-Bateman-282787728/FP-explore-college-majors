8186189,4,B000OPPQF0,"Having trained lots of agility dogs in the last ten years, I am looking at all the dvds about contacts. My old shelties had nice two on two off, but my new girl is going to run the aframe.
This is a detailed approach to training, with a ton of ideas cranked into it, from chapter 5 on, I watch one section a day. I am using alot of the ideas, but the dog I have now is getting a modified version I saw used with shelties about 5 years ago. I am using a contact board and hoops.
I cannot recoomend this enough, lots of interesting ideas, information and training about contacts, even if you choose another style, or modify this one, like I did.
