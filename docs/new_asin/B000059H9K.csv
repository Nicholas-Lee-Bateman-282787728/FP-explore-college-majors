7933249,2,B000059H9K,"Here is a unique cinematic province: smuggling of highest quality Cuban cigars into the United States, activity that apes marketing of illegal narcotics, with the main prize being Fidel Castro's favoured ""Mariposas"" that sell for $10/25000 per box, and the possession of which stimulates various groups in the script to willingly risk both danger and death. First-time director Brett Mayer, who also scripts, developed the concept while filming a documentary in Cuba, the featured role going to Lillo Brancato as Lenny Prince, a ""stick (cigar) man"" who deals black market smokes from Cuba to his tony Hollywood-based client&egrave;le. The kingpin who controls the West Coast black market cigar trade is Domino (Leo Rossi) into whose private Hollywood club Lenny sneaks to vend his product, and when Prince's friend Mark smuggles in, via Mexico, a large supply of Mariposas meant for Domino, Lenny attempts to obtain several boxes for his own sales stash. However, Mark's Cuban girl friend Maria (Justina Machado), active within an anti-Castro movement, plans to doublecross her lover by bartering the stolen Mariposas for automatic weapons to be delivered to her comrades in arms, and she persuades Lenny to assist her, the two conspirators then having to outmaneuver Domino and his goons, along with illicit gun dealers and corrupt law enforcement personnel. The film is handicapped by a very low budget, as is apparent from the sets, with an effect that production quality is unimpressive and shortcomings grow apace as the piece progresses, with erratic editing, lumpish blocking and scene set-ups, and mixed Latin and swing scoring that is unimpressive, at best. The opening credits are nicely done, and some able actors are on board, including the excellent Cuban player, Orestes Matacena (misspelled in the closing credits) as a paterfamilias of the Cuban resistance organization, and Howard George as Domino's principal henchman, with David Kriegel earning performing honours as a rather comedic thug, but Machado has a remarkably small emotive range in a film that essentially is betrayed by inexperience at the helm.",1130025600,,2125,5.3462686567164175
7933250,4,B000059H9K,"""Sticks"" is a seductive adventure in the underground world of cigar smuggling.  Lenny (played by Lillo Brancato, Jr.) a successful ""stick man"" gets mixed up with Domino's, a private club where Hollywood's high rollers share fast women and the love of illicit cigars.  A shipment of Fidel Castro's personal ""MARIPOSAS"" has been stolen by Mark (Keith Brunsmann), a smuggler planning to sell to Domino (Leo Rossi).  But Mark's girlfriend, Maria (Justina Machado) is plotting to swap the cigars for weapons to liberate Cuba.  Soon, Domino's crew of corrupt FBI agents and arms dealers are after the shipment...after the smoke clears, Lenny finds out how deadly illegal cigars can be.
I was excited to see this movie when I saw it was starring Lillo Brancato (A Bronx Tale, The Sopranos) He's hardly ever in a starring role even though he has obvious talent.  I thought the DVD was cool, not the best, but it was all right.  The resolution wasn't that good (it was kind of grainy), but it has a few decent features. (Trivia, short biographies of the actors, and some previews)  I DID like the movie though - It has a GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!  Lenny had some unusual friends (a midget and a transvestite) but the acting was good.  Dick Clark made a cameo playing a guy buying illegal cigars!!!  If you don't like independent films, or violence, it's not for you. But if you're crazy for Mr. Brancato or you like a good plot, then I recommend this movie: its 9O minutes of fun! Find this movie & watch it!",989366400,,1492,4.681992337164751
