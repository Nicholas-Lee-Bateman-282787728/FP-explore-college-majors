8492840,5,B0064RMII0,Great singer/actors make this 1978 performance one of the finest. Sung in German. But don't be fooled by the resellers here. This DVD is not out of print and can be found elsewhere at a fraction of the cost.,1426636800,2,207,4.333333333333333
8492841,5,B0064RMII0,"Times and tastes change. Today we are more likely to be offered Dvok's RUSALKA, so rich in allegorical and symbolic possibilities for a stage director, or any of several operas by Janek. But at one time, and for a long time, Smetana's tuneful bucolic comedy had no challenger as the world's most popular Czech opera. It is telling that 57 of its (to date) 83 Met performances took place in the years between 1909 (the Met premiere, Gustav Mahler on the podium) and 1942. A 36-year absence ended with a new staging by the Met's then-Director of Production, John Dexter, sets by his frequent collaborator Josef Svoboda, and a new English translation by Tony Harrison. This was one of the earliest Met telecasts, dated 21 November 1978.

Looking back, one notes immediately that in 1978, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was still in early days of its renaissance under James Levine. The maestro drives the players hard, and they scramble through Smetana's brilliant overture and dances, no match for the Czech Philharmonic under Zdenek Kosler on another DVD. The chorus, despite the translation sparing them intricate Czech speech rhythms, sounds loose and foggy, if high-spirited. Dexter, who claimed it was his idea to revive this opera, was valuable to the Met in the cash-strapped 1970s for his ability to put on a smart show on a limited budget, and the best of his productions from these years stood the test of time. DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES, BILLY BUDD, and LULU have all remained in service even in the second decade of the 21st century, and DON CARLO lasted almost that long. This is not one of his great productions, but it is serviceable and intelligent, the milieu of a Bohemian village created more through behavior and scenic economy than through a surfeit of gingerbread and stagy ""business."" A New York reviewer's 1978 pan, which can be read at the Met's archival site, puzzles and amuses in light of all we have had since. The author wrapped up with ""[I]f ever the folly of ""modern"" interpretations of past works of art was patent to the mob, it is here."" If only he knew...

What makes this a must-see BARTERED BRIDE, and one of the great Met DVDs, is the work of a high-profile cast. A controversial point (bothersome to the reviewer quoted above) is that the singers approach the work in a distinctly operatic way, rather than as theatrical fare needing a lighter touch, a break between Lulus, Lenskys, Otellos, and Hagens. The benefit in this is that there is no condescension in their performances, which are no less charming for being thoughtful and highly artistic as well. Nicolai Gedda, that superb linguist and paragon of good vocal hygiene, was 53 and sounding surprisingly fresh for it, and his Jenk is like a figure from a storybook -- hale, ingratiating, unflappable. The towering Martti Talvela manages not to be frightening in the least as Kecal, the blustering marriage broker, and he gets laughs by not seeming to try, just by letting the situations and the character do the work, with a bit of assistance from a thick Finnish accent he could not have subdued if he *had* tried. It is all sung in the voice of a great Boris, with some whopping low notes. Jon Vickers takes his work very seriously indeed, finding great pathos in the awkward, stuttering Vasek. In his first scene, after a bit of introductory feinting and stammering, when he lets the dam burst for a flood of that huge, bracing cold-water sound on the words ""If I weren't so tongue-tied, I'd have already wooed a bride,"" the heart leaps at a great singing actor bringing humanity to a character, just as he did for Florestan, Samson, Tristan, Peter Grimes. Best of all is the endlessly versatile Teresa Stratas as Maenka. She is in lovely voice, and if she seems a trifle modern and sophisticated, that works too in its way. Maenka is, after all, a smart cookie who can be conniving when it suits her (as poor Vasek learns...although, actually, it is never clear if he does learn). The smaller roles of both sets of parents and the Circus Manager are very well cast; one can overlook a poor Esmerelda.

The translation is valiant but of variable quality. Kecal's boast of his ""bags of brains"" may put the listener in mind of a Wes Craven film, and there is a heavy reliance on moon/June/spoon rhymes, leading to the likes of ""Scared to death, you heard her / Prophesy my murder / My beloved's hate'll / make my marriage fatal."" No doubt a Met performance of THE BARTERED BRIDE in the present day, whether in Czech or in English, would look and sound very different; the ""modernity"" criticized in 1978 now seems quaint. But this is filled with wonderful moments: Maenka standing up to Kecal, with Stratas coming up only a little higher than Talvela's navel. Stratas and Vickers at the end of their gorgeous duet, going round and round on a playground ride, laughing. And, most indelibly, in Maenka's lowest moment, when she believes she has been sold away by Jenk, Stratas achieving one of those extended passages in which everything becomes real, a great stage performer's art creating emotion that seems utterly free of artifice. In this flawed performance, there is more than a little magic.",1408060800,3,5196,4.771111111111111
8492842,5,B0064RMII0,"ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES IN OPERA. ALL IS NEARLY PERFECT. I WISH I COULD ALSO ENJOY THE METROPOLITAN VERSION OF STRAUSS' THE GYPSY BARON WITH NICOLAI GEDDA ... APPLAUSI PER TUTTI!

8492843,5,B0064RMII0,"This MET production of Bedrich Semtana's classic folk opera boasts a superb cast, including Nicolai Gedda, Jon Vickers, Teresa Stratas, and Marti Talvela. The staging and mis-en-scene is traditional and very well done. Everyone seems to be enjoying this presentation. Although not to the same standard as today's HD productions, this is still a wonderful way to get to know this delightful opera.",1356307200,5,396,5.301587301587301
8492844,3,B0064RMII0,"Delightful video from Levine's early days. Video is excellent, audio good for the time and the performance is unmatched on recording. The one version in Czech (with Benackova) is not nearly as well sung or acted, though it does have the virtue of being in the original language.",1345334400,4,278,4.8125
8492845,5,B0064RMII0,"This performance hails from 1978, with Teresa Stratas, Nicolai Gedda, Jon Vickers, and Martti Talvela, in John Dexter's production. This is a truly great performance. The staging is marvelous, the choreography (by Pavel mot) is stunning, and the sets (by Josef Svoboda) and costumes (Jan Skalicky) a delight. Dexter's production is one of his finest, and is a marvel of invention and beauty. (Especially noteworthy is the blending of actors and dancers.) The English translation, by the English poet and playwright Tony Harrison, is so far above the ordinary that it makes many other translators' work (say, Ruth and Thomas Martin) risible.

The cast could hardly be bettered. Stratas (who had recorded this opera, in German translation, in 1975, opposite Ren Kollo and Janet Perry as Esmeralda) is here at her zenith, beautiful and touching as an actress. She was a mistress of intimacy, ideal for the medium of film. Small-scaled and intense, she is the Eleonora Duse to Maria Callas's Sarah Bernhardt. Gedda was past the age of fifty by 1978, yet gives an excellent portrayal of an impetuous, but sly, youth. He is also in splendid voice. Before the prima, Vickers had warned us that we would weep for his character, and indeed we do so. The greatest Tristan, Otello, ne, Grimes, and Parsifal, is here a stuttering simpleton, who even dons a bear-suit! Talvela, with his impenetrable Finnish accent, is a towering, amusing villain.

In the well-cast secondary roles, we have another distinguished Canadian Heldentenor, Alan Crofoot, as the Circus Manager. He was ideal in this, his Met debut. (Tragically, he was the victim of a suicide the following year.)

In his posthumous ""autobiography,"" Dexter revealed that Levine was originally considering another production of the ""played-out"" ""Die Fledermaus,"" but that the British director suggested the Smetana instead. This set is, incidentally, a good example of the inexplicitness of the Metropolitan's omission of the names of stage directors on the front covers of most of their DVDs.",1325289600,15,2039,5.191489361702128
