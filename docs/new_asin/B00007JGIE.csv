1812201,5,B00007JGIE,"The unimaginable struggle of orphaned Kurdish children living near the Iran-Iraq border is somewhat fictionalized in a story of their involvement in various smuggling scams in which they are routinely cheated of their compensation.  Harrowing scenes of trying to roll huge truck tires over a snowy mountain under conditions so appalling that the mules and horses have to be fed whisky to get them to work.  Director Bahman Ghobadi has fashioned an extraordinary 80-minute slice of life that refuses to be dismissed or forgotten by anyone who experiences it.  Peter Bradshaw of UK's The Guardian says, ""...this is a film with its own unflinching gaze, a film that makes children bear the burden of an existence too much for any adult.  The pain and aftermath of war is painted here with indelible shades of pain.",1299715200,2,811,4.985185185185185

1812203,3,B00007JGIE,"I'm am NOT the type of person who constantly wants escapist films with happy endings, nor do I flinch from depictions of poverty and hardship.

But -- at the risk of sounding typically ""American"" and shallow (although the two are not necessarily synonymous)-- for me this movie didn't have much substance or purpose other than showing how hard life is for the Kurds in Iran. As a glimpse into another culture, it was interesting. As a dramatic film, it was dismal and empty and almost too manipulatively pathetic.

Naturally, I applaud the director's first effort at raising awareness of his people, but I look forward to his maturing as a film maker.",1232582400,3,651,4.803571428571429
1812204,4,B00007JGIE,"This is film that requires patience and close attention to appreciate. It's definitely not for everyone, but those who enjoy obscure little gems will want to give this one a look. It took me a while to understand the plot, and then my interest in the movie increased significantly.

As others have commented, the film provides a candid glimpse of the austere, dangerous life that many Kurds in northern Iraq must endure.  This is a lifestyle that will amaze and startle most viewers who live in developed countries.

Without spoiling the plot, I'll simply state that this is a film of family love and sacrifice that will touch your heart.  Just remember that the story doesn't follow the typical Hollywood formula.

Be patient and ENJOY!",1225238400,,737,4.864
1812205,4,B00007JGIE,"The strong feature debut of Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi (`Turtles Can Fly' 'Marooned in Iraq') is a simple story against the background of stark reality of the Kurds living in Iran, or I should say, in Kurdistan the area that includes south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, and western Iran. In this `A Time for Drunken Horses' Ghobadi a Kurd himself shows how children must survive on their own in Kurdish village, doing illegal (and highly dangerous) job of smuggling across the border between Iran and Iraq.

Ayoub is a 12-year-old boy who works in the town nearby, and he takes care of his elder physically handicapped brother Madi. Madi is slowly getting worse, and Ayoub knows that his brother needs an operation. Madi has also two sisters Rojin and Ameneh, but lost his mother recently, and another sad news arrive - the death of his father on the smuggling trip.

Now Ayoub must quit the school and work for his remaining family. This means Ayoub has to follow the footsteps of his father, who went across the Iran-Iraq border as smuggler. But the road is covered with snow, and the trip is risky because of the landmines and soldiers. And the employers may not be trustworthy. Even the mules have to endure very tough trek in the heavy snow (and people have to have them drink whiskey - hence the title though the director changed it to ""horses"").

[BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE] Following the tradition of Iranian films in which the line that divides fiction and non-fiction is blurred, Ayoub is played by real-life Kurd boy Ayoub Ahmadi, and Madi by Madi Ekhtiar-dini. They are no professional actors, but the fact works to make the film realistic, sometimes almost like documentary. But what is most impressive is the stunning beauty of the landscapes. The images are often poetic, but still never fail to capture the life of the people living there. You have never seen anything like the awe-inspiring scenes in which the smugglers walk in the snowfield with the mules carrying two huge tires strapped to their sides.

Probably not every Kurdish child lives a life like this, and `Marooned in Iraq' Bahman Ghobadi's follow-up to `Drunken Horses' shows a different aspect of the life of Kurdish people (about music in particular). Thus you can see the film as political message from the unjustly treated people, but at the same time it is strong with a more universal theme about the children who must confront the hard reality of life. Either way, the film is unforgettable.",1138147200,8,2480,4.841981132075472
1812206,5,B00007JGIE,"Incredible in storyline, filmography, a truly important film for people to see all over the world.  Tragic and yet inspiring in subject matter--the most convincing and truly heroic effort of survival.  Recommended for all--schools may particularly want this film as part of world culture/current events classes, Americans will want to see this film as a reminder that there are real human faces of sadness and hope behind the politics of nations at war.",1121817600,3,453,5.191780821917808
1812207,3,B00007JGIE,"This film garners a lot of praise in film circles, but I wonder if it isn't more a result of its novelty as the first Kurdish feature film than of anything that actually happens on screen.
  Though a decent depiction and sympathetic portrayal of the bleak surroundings and life of a community of Iranian Kurds, the film is essentially similar to a lot of work that Majid Majidi has done, though it lacks his cinematic flair and storytelling skill.  Surprisingly, for an amateur cast, the acting is pretty good (compare this with the abysmal acting in the vastly overrated film ""Kandahar"" by Mohsen Makhmalbaf), and the camera work is not bad, but again, there is nothing particularly novel or interesting about this film other than that is Kurdish.  There is something almost patronizing about the praise that has been heaped on this film.  It is as if no matter what a Kurdish director produces, it is going to be praised for its very existence, not as a work of cinema in and of itself.  I personally think Bahman Ghobadi could have done a better job, and hopefully he will attempt to depict Kurdish life in a more dynamic and unique way in his next film.",1080172800,5,1157,4.619512195121951

7976756,4,B00007JGIE,"""A Time For Drunken Horses"" (2000 release from Kurdistan; 75 min.) brings the story of Ayoub, a 12 yr. old boy and the rest of his family (his 3 sisters, 2 brothers and his dad), The family lives in the Kurdish region which straddles the Iran-Iraq border region, and the only way to make a living is to smuggle things between the two countries. Not long into the movie, Ayoub's dad dies during one of those smuggling outings and now Ayoub must step in and provide for the rest of his siblings, including his crippled brother who badly needs an operation. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is filmed using nothing but local, non-professional actors, and what a performance each of them gives, non more so that Ayoub Ahmadi, the 12 yr. old boy (all of the actors used their real names in the movie). Second, it feels as if this movie was shot in ""cinema verite"" style, which brings you even closer into the scenes. Third, beware, there are a number of tough scenes in the movie which left me emotionally gut-punched, but making this movie all the more powerful.

This movie was originally released in 2000, and this DVD is the 2011 re-release by Lorber Films. Unfortunately there are no bonus materials whatsoever, which make this DVD reissue a missed opportunity. That aside, this movie brings an outstanding portrait of the human condition in one of the more challenging places on earth. So glad I saw this movie. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""A Time For Drunken Horses"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1402099200,2,1720,4.636065573770492
7976757,3,B00007JGIE,"Zamani Baray Masti Absha (A Time for Drunken Horses) (Bahman Ghobadi, 2000)

I have no idea what, exactly, Bahman Ghobadi, a Kurdish filmmaker currently best-known for his film No One Knows About Persian Cats, was thinking when he came up with the plot of A Time for Drunken Horses. Nor what he was ingesting, since I find it very hard to imagine that this movie, or at least some of its stranger details, was conceived by someone in a perfectly sober state. Needless to say, this ups the interest factor on what might otherwise be the kind of movie that some folks might call one of those movies where nothing happens. They're wrong, of course, but you know exactly the type of movie I'm talking about, the kind that generally appeals to critics and art-film nerds, but that most of the public couldn't care less about. Have you ever seen an Abbas Kiarostami movie? Than yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Kiarostami, too, is Iranian. He's somewhat better-known than Ghobadi. I'm not sure why; both of them are quite good at what they do, both of them take a lot of chances in their work, and both of them have quietly amassed a corpus that is as deep as it is pretty. But first you've got to scratch the surface hard enough to get at what's underneath, and I seem to have talked myself into helping you figure out how to do that with A Time for Drunken Horses, Sit back, relax, etc.

As with most slice-of-life movies, A Time for Drunken Horses is essentially plotless for much of its length. It centers on a family of smugglers working the Iran-Iraq border. After the father of the clan is incapacitated, twelve-year-old Ayoub (like all the film's principals, in his only screen appearance) is forced to take over the business, both to feed his family and to save money for the medical care of his handicapped brother Madi (Madi Ekhtiar-dini). The family dynamic is interrupted when the family's uncle negotiates the hand of oldest daughter Rojin (Rojin Younessi) in marriage, which they hope will provide enough of a dowry to pay for an operation for Madi. The film's title refers to the alcohol-spiked water Ayoub and the other smugglers feed their pack mules both to keep them working and to fend off the cold in the Iranian mountains; work too hard, give them too much, and the animals get drunk. With Ayoub working overtime, the animals get very drunk indeed.

Many of the reviews of the movie I have read while pondering mine speak to the movie's documentary-like atmosphere. I find that oddnot because I don't believe that there are families out there in poverty scraping by with smuggling (hell, I can see that in the Cleveland suburbs), but because the entire film is overlaid with a sheen of absurdity it's well-nigh impossible not to notice. The Kiarostami influence is there, of course, and it manifests itself in that blend of realism and absurdism you find in movies like A Taste of Cherry or Shirin. I'm not talking about extended fantasy sequences or anything, just that sense you get that things are just a little off. Things get more off the drunker the pack mules get. This is not coincidental. And then you get to the climax, or what passes for a climax in a film with such flat affect (and that, in itself, is part of what feels so absurd about this movie; it could have gone any way from melodrama to screwball comedy, and instead Ghobadi seems like he's trying to recreate the cinematography of Taiga in a film five times shorter). If you find yourself sitting there saying what just happened? to yourself, you're not alone. Especially when the credits start rolling a couple of minutes later. A lot of people saw this as huge. I don't know why, but I ended up seeing a curiosity. An interesting one to be sure, but I was not as moved by it as most. ** ",1400803200,,3783,4.591715976331361
7976758,4,B00007JGIE,"Spellbinding film that depicts sadness of a people and the toll it has taken on the Kurdish children.  The movie was somewhat difficult to follow at times, and the fact that these were Kurds was not all that clear in the movie.  Nevertheless, it was eye opening and hard to believe that these children were actors.",1399507200,,314,4.589285714285714
7976759,5,B00007JGIE,"A Kurdish family is decimated as was Kurdistan after the Ottoman Empire breakup.

Kurds have no country (Or three if you consider the Kurdish populations in Iraq, Iran, and Turkey.
They have little or no representation in the governments.  They have at times been prevented from teaching their children the Kurdish in Turkey and other places.  Somehow they have maintained the Kurdish ethnic identity and subsisted any way they can.

This movie is by a Kurdish director and follows a family surviving by smuggling goods in the Iraq-Iran border.

It has a very ducumentary (Like you are watching the real smuggling.) feel to it.

The horses are given alcohol to help them against the gold and to keep them from bolting under gunfire and Mortar fire from the military guarding th border.

A difficult story to tell and a difficult story to watch.  Everyone should see this film.",1367798400,,876,4.871621621621622

7976761,5,B00007JGIE,"I have always said that in foreign film, children seem to be burdened with tremendous responsibility, experience undo hardships, moreso than our counterparts displayed in American film.

This wonderful, moving film is driven by children in this small family.  They have  remarkable concern and ultimate care for one another.  When the father, a smuggler to the Iran/Iraq border dies, the children take over with incredible courage and compassion.

The setting is at the Iran/Iraq border, mountainous snow-filled country, where smugglers risk their lives, health, and their pay,  as their carry heavy loads, some on mules, across the border, often encountering landmines, bandits, and brutal deep snow.  The father of the family is killed during a crossing, thus leaving the eldest, Ayoub, 12 years old,  to rise to adulthood, and care for his siblings.  The children are determined to continue their studies.

One of the siblings, a 15-year old is handicapped, needs injections, plus an operation, or he will die soon.  The child, Madi, is dwarf-like, very small.  The oldest boy, Ayoub, is determined to make a crossing, just to have money for Madi's operation.  The oldest daughter, a young teen, is arranged to marry, and she agrees only because, also, there will be a way to have brother's surgery.

As usual, the child actors are non-professional.  They have done a wonderful job!  The movie keeps you rooting for the children, and you remain interested the entire film.  Excellent and a remarkable film....Rizzo",1342396800,,1517,5.202479338842975
7976762,3,B00007JGIE,"I've been dying to own this film on DVD for a decade, and it's finally out! Unfortunately, it's a zero-effort affair, with no extras at all, a problematic transfer, and huge subtitles burned onto the picture. The video clearly came from a PAL transfer, and while it's quite crisp and clear, there's jitter from the difference in frame rates. (Seriously, what is this, 1997??)

The film is an unflinching achievement, and is more than worth putting up with the crappy disc, but I am pretty unhappy.",1307750400,4,497,4.77906976744186
