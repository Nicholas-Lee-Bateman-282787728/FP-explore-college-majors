3924591,1,B002G3DTSE,"We fans in North America have been duped by PBS video! It was bad enough that we endure a lazy DVD production that is 2 years behind what's available in the UK and simply applies the ""Masterpiece Mystery"" broadcast version of the show onto video. That is to say, one must endure annoying PBS ads; a superficial intro by host Alan Cumming; an unacceptable preview that spoils some surprises for anyone hoping to enjoy the episode freshly; and a cruel removal of Barrington Pheloung's end credit theme music for the show, which I've therefore never heard.

HOWEVER, each of these episodes is missing about 10 minutes of story that has been edited out so that PBS can air the show in its 90 minute time slot. I found this out when I realized that my ""Inspector Morse"" DVDs released by Carleton Video always ran about 1 hour and 34 minutes, and asked PBS if ""Lewis"" should really be longer than the DVDs' 1 hour and 24 minutes. They had the courtesy to admit the truth. Why it's necessary for PBS (which has long publicized itself as commercial free) to edit out 10 instead of 3 minutes is beyond me, but we're missing out on details and texture in the story telling that is available to UK viewers and DVD buyers.

It is one thing if PBS decided to do this for its on-air version, but Shop PBS hasn't had the decency to restore the original footage back into the DVD release; even more supposedly commercial studios like Fox Home Video treat fans better than this!  Yet, what's especially unacceptable about all this is that PBS has made it impossible for a more considerate and honest company like Carleton Video to do the program justice by releasing the full versions of the episodes. This is because, according to ITV America, PBS has acquired exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the DVDs in North America. So, PBS hasn't just released a bad product for fans of the show, but has prevented other companies from doing a better job. What disgusting and monopolistic behavior for an entity officially dedicated to serving the public. When it comes to Inspector Lewis, it has carried out a willful public disservice!

3924627,3,B002G3DTSE,"Forgive my very crude and loose allusion to the Garden of Eden, but it more or less describes my opinion of the complex problems with this mystery series: Inspector Lewis. (I am writing here for Series 2, but I own the whole set.)  My problems first.  How any UK production can in good conscience issue movies/videos without subtitles is one my chief complaints.  Granted we don't speak English on this side of the Atlantic, but we might like to improve our version of that language....and at the same time understand the many UK accents that one confronts in such series (others like Monarch of the Glenn for example demand that help).  PBS owes us subtitles, not just for the hearing challenged, but for all of us. Shame on them.  Next, these fine mysteries, for fine they are in the Morse and Agatha Christie line, do NOT need gratutious blood and violence. But again for the sake of the almighty dollar I am sure, we get violence on screen, blood on screen, and longer cuts of murders in process.  People of good taste would have left all that out and just shown the corpse...for we learn well the cause of deaths in the dialogues.  This is perhaps my biggest criticism of this series, and was also an occasional one for the overall excellent Morse series, which despite it's violence, I loved.  Finally my last complaint is the same as all those above, the cutting of running time and certain other things like excellent music of the soundtrack composer, Barrington Pheloung.

The good things are a delight to praise:  outstanding acting, outstanding plot, and outstanding atmosphere and character development (which along with the Japanese director Ozu I prize more highly than plot).  But the joy of Morse and Lewis here continued with Hathaway is the literary and world religion allusions, quotes, associations, etc.  They keep me running to pull books off my shelf.

So, the Garden are these good things, the loss of paradise is the bad editing, no subtitles and unnecessary screen violence.  Five stars for the Garden, no stars for the ejection from Eden; hence an average of two point five stars, or so.",1353715200,3,2114,4.771978021978022
3924628,4,B002G3DTSE,"As a successor to the popular Inspector Morse series, ""Inspector Lewis"" takes the former protagonist's young sergeant (now not quite-so-young) and gives him a show and sergeant of his own. Still grieving from the loss of his wife in a hit-and-run accident, and paired with the droll and laconic James Hathaway, Robert Lewis solves crimes in and around the beautiful city of Oxford, the center of scholarly pursuits and their associated ambitions. As such, most of the mysteries have an academic bent to them, with plenty of allusions to poetry, literature and history.

Kevin Whatley and Laurence Fox bounce off each other nicely as polar opposites Lewis and Hathaway: the former hot-headed and hard-working, the latter detached and intuitive. Their personalities are ones that you seldom see ascribed to the ages of each man, making this a unique combination in police partnerships. Though they are an odd couple and seemingly have little in common, their bond visibly grows over the course of the episodes until they're friends and confidants as well as colleagues. Backing them up is Clare Holman as Doctor Laura Hobson, police coroner and would-be love interest to Lewis, and Rebecca Front as Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent, who like all bosses, fluctuates between being a help and a hindrance.

I have to admit that I didn't enjoy the second season of ""Lewis"" as much as the first one. With a ninety-minute running time, the episodes are quite long, and although season one did a good job of keeping things moving at a brisk pace, these ones tend to drag a little, particularly the first two. As well as this, the plots themselves feel less sophisticated. Naturally all mysteries involve some degree of coincidence, but these quite often depend on introducing a disparate group of people and situations that gradually end up interweaving in rather contrived ways. Often it takes a long time for Lewis and Hathaway to catch up with the actual plot, resulting in long stretches of time in which the show doesn't feel like a police investigative drama at all.

This is especially true of the first episode, ""And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea"" which takes ages to get cracking - or even for a dead body to turn up. Eventually though, a beautiful young art student is found drowned in the river, seemingly connected to crimes related to book theft and forgery. To make matters even more difficult, the key witness is an autistic boy that has trouble communicating his thoughts.

In ""Music To Die For"" a man is strangled to death in what appears to be a botched burglary, though soon evidence emerges that links it to a local boxing club. This is quite a convoluted mystery, involving a variety of clues alluding to the compositions of Wagner, unlicensed boxing matches, former agents of the German police state, and a rather unnecessary love triangle that has no real bearing on the case at hand. However, fans of the BBC's fantasy show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>&nbsp;might get a kick out of recognizing Bradley James (aka Prince Arthur) in one of his first roles.

""Life Born of Fire"" is probably the best of the season, not only centering on a string of serial killings done for reasons both thought-provoking and oddly sympathetic, but also shedding light on Hathaway's past. After Will McEwan shoots himself in a church, Lewis and Hathaway are urged to dismiss the case as a straightforward suicide. But Lewis can't shake the feeling that the young man was pushed to his death, and further investigations lead him to a group known as the Garden, a Christian organization that attempts to ""cure"" gay people. Now they are being picked off one by one by a serial killer with a fiery theme - but the most obvious suspect is nowhere to be found.

In ""The Great and the Good"" a young rape victim is found wandering in a field. All the clues as to the identity of her assailant point to the most unlikely man imaginable, one who furthermore has an unbreakable alibi provided by three well-respected Oxford businessmen. Yet why would three high-profile men have anything to do with a mere university technician? And if he was innocent of the crime, then why did he end up brutally murdered just a few days later? Clearly there's more to this case than meets the eye, and Lewis's interest is exacerbated when he gets a posthumous letter from the murder victim.

Though it's not the best season, it's still classic ""Lewis"", with plenty of emphasis on literary references and panning shots of Oxford's beautiful architecture. As Lewis grounds the series with his dogged and down-to-earth demeanor, it leaves Hathaway to be the more enigmatic presence - though we learn more about his background this series, particularly to do with his stint as a priest. Two likable leads and carefully paced mysteries make ""Lewis"" a classic British mystery series.",1349913600,,4951,5.023142509135201
3924629,5,B002G3DTSE,"After the poor video quality of series one, I was expecting the same from series 2. It is improved, thankfully.

3924636,2,B002G3DTSE,"Review Part I:

After watching the last of PBS' current series of Lewis last night, I am so glad I stopped by these reviews today, because it has explained to me something that I was puzzled and unhappy about, regarding the entire Lewis series (which I have only watched in the US on PBS, not in the UK on ITV).

About 75% of the way through each episode of Lewis, there always seems to be a huge jump in the story, where the viewer cannot put 2 and 2 together to make 4, but the lead characters always seem to understand it perfectly. One minute it's a murder fest and the next minute they are having a pint after the dastardly villain has been taken in for questioning.  I have had to watch almost all of the Lewis episodes that were shown in the US a second time, for the plot to even make sense.  This was really bothering me, and I was blaming the Lewis writers for it, because the Inspector Morse series, as far as I can remember, did not have this kind of weird, incomprehensible rush to the ending.

However, after reading the 1-star and 2-star reviews here, I know what has been happening -- PBS has been cutting 10 minutes off of each episode (for absolutely no good reason), therefore showing a cut version in the US, and that's why the dramas seem so choppy in places (especially towards the end, in my view).

It's one thing to cut 10 minutes off of a musical program or a travelogue, but it's quite another to cut 10 minutes, towards the end, off of a mystery drama the very point of which is how interrelated every element of the story is in reaching a final conclusion in a natural manner and at a reasonable pace.  Ridiculous.  This is a crazy decision by PBS.  It is insulting to the audience and it's unfair to the creators (writers, actors, producers, etc.) of the series.

Review Part II:

There is another reason I have given this series a low grade.  I cannot stand Alan Cumming's introductions.

The late Alastair Cook who introduced various UK miniseries on the PBS of old was a great host, and I later learned that he was quite well-known in the UK for all sorts of journalistic reasons that had nothing to do with his PBS hosting bit, although it was the main thing he was known for in the US.  Of course, he can't be replaced.

But Alan Cumming is kind of an odd choice.  He always seems a little dodgy -- in behavior, countenance, and fashion choices!  His voice isn't pleasant, and his attempts to be ""dramatic"" and clever fall flat.  He's worn the same outfit to introduce every episode of the current PBS Lewis season (obviously the intros were all filmed on the same day, but that's no reason not to make it look a little more polished by having a different outfit on when introducing each week's program) and his shiny trousers this time are way too tight and caught my attention for all the wrong reasons (and not in a pleasant way either).

Now, it might seem petty to give PBS' box set of Lewis a low mark due to shiny too-tight trousers on a too-actory fellow who comes off as a bit of a tosser, but the entire series would be much better off if these silly introductions were axed and we could just have the deleted 10 minutes of the actual productions back on the screen each week.

Review Part III:

Even if we had the full-length episodes and no Alan Cumming introductions, I would still give the Inspector Lewis episodes a 3 out of 5.  Respectable, worth it at times, but no instant classic.  I thought the Inspector Morse series was better generally, although the quality across episodes varied, of course.  I think the Lewis writers are really stretching to think of the most outlandish things they can to bring something new into the stories, and they often go too far into the ridiculous.

I find the Lewis shows comforting, like a familiar blanket and cup of cocoa, when you don't want to think too much (in fact, you cannot think too much while watching, since PBS America has deleted 10 minutes of crucial plot build-up), and when you just want to see some pretty scenery and to hear some British accents.  I have never really warmed up to Lewis as a character (or even to Whately as an actor); I enjoyed Morse's personality more.  I actually like the Hathaway character since I think the actor himself is kind of attractive (in a gangly, geeky way; miles more handsome than Chris Evans in my book, but that's another thing altogether!) and he does lend some oldish-youthfulness to the situations they find themselves in.

However, I am sure that if I lived in the UK at the moment I wouldn't watch these shows very often, because of all the other choices on UK tv.  It's only because I live in the US right now and there are very few UK dramas available to watch (although I get BBC World in the US, it's a sorry excuse for a channel -- there is no relation between its schedule and the real schedules of the real BBC channels) that the Lewis shows are of interest to me.

The first Morse episode I ever watched was when I was living in Woodstock (Oxfordshire) and flipping around the channels - it was the ""Last Bus to Woodstock"" episode, so it caught my attention.  Ever since, I've seen about 1/3rd of the Morse series, and I have a soft spot in my heart for Morse, even though I'm seemingly about 25 years younger than the program's current fanbase.

===
2012 note:  If you are interested, the w-pedia listing may still have an explanation of how PBS edited and re-numbered the Lewis shows (variations from the ITV series in the UK).  There was one episode they didn't show at all in the US.

I think this year's Lewis series is to be the last, or next to last.  Colin Dexter was quoted earlier this year saying that it's probably time to stop with Lewis.

Also, if you like Morse, you might want to watch Endeavour, the one-off/pilot episode about Morse as a young police officer, screened in the UK in January and in the US (Masterpiece Mystery on PBS) in July of 2012.  It's been commissioned as a series in the UK (4 to 6 episodes is the typical series length there) and either will be aired beginning in September or filmed beginning in September.",1285545600,6,6107,4.424486148346738
3924637,5,B002G3DTSE,"The long running Inspector Morse series was not only a critical success but became a pop icon. So it is tempting to view the upstart Inspector Lewis series as an entertaining spin-off unlikely to equal the excellence of the original. I have viewed series one and two and like how the relationship between Lewis and his Sargeant Hathaway is being slowly developed with each episode revealing a bit more. The Morse series settled the Morse/Lewis relationship in just the first few episodes then settled into the fondly remembered abuse and affection, supporting and conflicting relationship. Because the relationship was settled so quickly,after the first few morse episodes, the viewer can watch the Morse episodes out of sequence and lose nothing. The Lewis episodes should be watched in sequence to get the full effect of the series. The Lewis episodes are more complex in that multiple nastiness in being perpetrated by multiple characters in each episode. In the first two series, I thought every episode was as entertaining as the best Morse episode. Don't be put off by Morse snobs. Give this series a try. I beleive it is actually better than the Morse series.",1282521600,3,1166,5.015463917525773

3924644,5,B002G3DTSE,"First things first. The other reviews on this pages are completely erroneous. I watch this set (yes the American PBS version) and it DOES NOT, I repeat DOES NOT cut out 10 minutes off each episode. Each episode runs around 1 hour and 32-34 minutes long. It may be that they removed the 10 minutes for broadcast on television but in any case they were re-added to the DVD because the episodes are present in their entirety in this set. Again there is NO time missing from these DVDs. I don't know if the other reviewers just don't know how to read time on a DVD player but there is NO time missing here.
But back to the actual series, this is quite a nice series. A very clever way of keeping the Morse series alive, the characters are charming and the backdrops lovely. The mysteries are not always the most suspenseful of ones but the show does a nice job of developing characters, a refreshing change from the fast past action we are used to here in the US.

The settings are the same, the acting is just as good, but Lewis' character is in some ways more interesting than Morse's. At least he's more upbeat. I am working my way through the Morse series again, and am struck by how depressed he seemed and how depressing the stories were. Lewis is a different man, and despite the loss of his wife, he has a more positive outlook. His humanity is closer to the surface than in Morse's case.

3924652,5,B002G3DTSE,"I totally agree with the people who are peeved with PBS for cutting these episodes. It's shameful! Having said that, however, both Series 1 and Series 2 are worth watching (and owning) even in their edited forms. I, too, was (and remain) an avid fan of Inspector Morse. That series was the very best of what television has to offer and nothing will ever be able to take its place. However, since this isn't an ""either or"" situation, I highly recommend adding Inspector Lewis to your collection of British mysteries. It's thoroughly enjoyable to see that Lewis has come into his own--and that his nature has remained essentially the same as when he was Morse's young sidekick. Lewis isn't the type of fellow who changes much, because he's comfortable in his own skin. The rather enigmatic character of Hathaway is an excellent complement to the down-to-earth Lewis, but at the same time has wisely not been written to simply be a younger version of the complex Morse. The series hasn't entirely found its footing yet. Some of the plots are a tad convoluted--and every now and again Lewis makes an observation that doesn't seem quite ""Lewis"" - as we've come to know him. But...all in all the continuity is there, and there's rich soil in which each of the main characters, and the series, can grow. And of course, it is SO very good to be back in Oxford!",1256342400,2,1352,4.661087866108787
3924653,4,B002G3DTSE,"""Inspector Lewis"" Series 2 is an improvement over Series 1, which suffered from contrived conflicts and lack of attention paid to the characters. DCS Innocent (Rebecca Front) is back for this season, and this time she is usually on the same side as her detectives, which makes better sense. Pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) is a minor character in every episode but an appealing one. The biggest improvement is bringing the focus back to the detectives and their partnership. This series probably reveals too much about the veteran widower DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and younger, Cambridge-educated DS Hathaway (Laurence Fox), but the detectives are ultimately more interesting than their suspects. It picks up two mysteries that were introduced in the debut episode: who was culpable in the death of Lewis' wife, and why did Hathaway abandon his seminary studies?

There's a conspicuous effort to be high brow, but its more fun than obnoxious. All but one of the episodes have some connection to Oxford University. They all contain some artistic element, usually literary, that is often a clue in the mystery. Three episodes have literary titles, and the allusions run the gamut from Sophocles to Shakespeare to contemporary fantasy fiction. There are 7 episodes of uneven quality.  A few defy all credibility: ""Music to Die For"", ""The Great and the Good"", ""Allegory of Love"". The best are mysteries with tangible motives: ""And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea"", ""The Quality of Mercy"". There are inconsistencies in the character writing that betrays a certain amount of sloppiness. More care taken to write plots that make basic sense would also be appreciated. But the appeal of the Lewis-Hathaway is steadily increasing, so mission accomplished.

To be clear, the 7 episodes that are being sold as ""Series 2"" in the United States aired as Series 2 (4 episodes) and part of Series 3 (3 episodes) in the UK. For some reason, we are getting one-and-three-quarters series in this package. The missing episode from the UK Series 3 is ""Counter Culture Blues"", which presumably will air in the US at some later date with Series 4, which is already in production. PBS has cut 8 minutes from each episode to fit their 85-minute time slot. The episodes run 93 minutes in the UK. Unfortunately, the missing footage has not been restored on the DVDs.",1256256000,6,2345,5.007692307692308
3924654,5,B002G3DTSE,"I originally saw Series 2 in London 2 years ago and, given some of the pithy reviews regarding the editing of the US version, felt compelled to put my two cents in.

First of all, Lewis isn't Morse and I suspect much of the criticism is centered in this undeniable fact.  I also own all the Morse episodes and periodically replay them for pleasure and to see how they age in light of the twenty plus years since the series started.  Truth be told, there's more than a couple clunkers in the lot that get by, not on the story line but, on the intense character study that John Thaw brought to the role.  There's never going to be another Morse.

Lewis is a much different character, schooled by Morse but certainly not a protege.  His forte is more dogged than sheer brilliance.  His sergeant (Laurence Fox) likewise is no Lewis; much more complex and less conventional.  In fact the roles of the two series are somewhat reversed in many respects.  His Sergeant Hathaway seems to be the brilliant, but troubled police detective while Lewis remains somewhat more centered in convention.  It's almost like Hathaway is a younger less experienced Morse, though his Cambridge education will never get him invited to ""high table"" the way Morse often was.  The main difference between the two series, aside from the absence of John Thaw, is the Lewis episodes  are much tighter written and clearly scripted for the screen rather than being adapted from books (not too many of these actually, most of the Morse episodes were credited to ""ideas"" of Colin Dexter).

Series 2 is superior to Series 1 in character development and story line and includes 7 full (minus the 10 minutes) episodes to the screen.  They're all good to very good and the editing is generally tasteful and not germain to the story line, though I could do without the obsequious PBS host sneering his way through the intos.  While still not at the exalted level of the Morse series, Lewis shows promise and provides good entertainment and some nice Morse recollections to boot.",1255996800,13,2038,4.7175141242937855
3924655,5,B002G3DTSE,"If one were to take the excellent Colin Dexter series, ""Morse"" and its equally excellent spin-off series, ""Lewis,"" at face value, Oxford would certainly rank as a city where one would not want to live, much less attend University. Inspiring more mayhem per capita than than Los Angeles, Juarez, Naples, and Port Said rolled into one, the City of Dreaming Spires would seem to be the Murder Capital of the UK, if not the world!

And let the mayhem continue, because it merely serves as an excuse for us quality-starved television viewers to follow the increasingly curmudgeonly  Inspector Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) and his increasingly ""dishy"" sidekick Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox)--Oxford's finest!--as they relentlessly follow each convoluted trail until, through a combination of logic, deduction and just plain luck, they arrive at the solution to each convoluted mystery. Watching the relationship develop between these two extremely private individuals is as fascinating and complex as are the mysteries themselves. The acting is superb, the cinematography is outstanding; as is the music by Barrington Ph.--I shall not misspell his surname--who gave us the ""Morse"" code in the former series. The dialogue and plots are not only engaging but also intellectually stimulating.

PBS has packaged a four-disk set with seven mysteries under the ""Masterpiece Mystery"" label and has called it Series Two. The set has its good points and, as others have observed, its bad. On the positive side, the mysteries, encoded in widescreen NTSC, can be viewed in letter-box format. The images are clear, as is the sound (although one does wish that the producers had taken a page from the BBC in ""Reginald Perrin"" and provided proper subtitles rather than closed captioning, which is sometimes difficult to follow during an exchange of rapid-fire dialogue). On the negative side (the cuts mentioned by others being duly noted), PBS (ultimately ITV) has encoded ""DVD-Rom Features"" that are unreadable by a Mac, as well as adverts about other ""Masterpiece"" DVD features. Perhaps if they had omitted these essentially useless [to the viewer] advertisements, they would have had room for the ten-minutes cut from these otherwise absorbing mysteries.

Nevertheless, since multi-region DVD players are not readily available in my neck of the woods, the PBS box set, which presents the viewer with exactly what they see on the ""Masterpiece"" program, is sufficient to provide one's Lewis and Hathaway fix--a dreamingly inspired antidote to the banality of the ""reality"" shows that infest our television sets today.",1255824000,7,2618,5.347087378640777
3924656,5,B002G3DTSE,"2009's ""Inspector Lewis: Series 2"" features Kevin Whately as Detective Inspector Robbie Lewis, formerly of the Inspector Morse series, back for another turn on his own with the Thames Valley police force in a highly enjoyable seven-part second series.  This series 2 appears to contain the episodes that were marketed in the UK as Series 2 and 3, which has led to some confusion among US viewers.

Inspector Lewis is again paired with young Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), working a series of murder cases in and around Oxford University.  Lewis continues to be something of a misfit around the tradition and privilege-heavy campus, a situation only slightly mitigated by Sergeant Hathaway, a former student and, enigmatically, a former seminarian.  The fitful growth of their professional relationship is one of the themes of Series 2.  In the episode ""Life Born of Fire"", Hathaway's mysterious past becomes the key to a difficult case involving the murder of a former student, and almost the cause of his own death.

A second theme of Series 2 is the festering cold case of the hit-and-run death of Inspector Lewis's wife.  In the episode ""The Great and the Good"", the detectives are given reason to think the case might finally be solved.  In ""The Quality of Mercy"", an unlikely suspect is uncovered in the course of the investigation into the murder of a student actor.

As with Series 1, the cases are presented in a deliberate manner.  The two detectives spend most of each episode methodically weeding through clues to eliminate suspects.  Lewis continues as the crusty, intuitive, and old-fashioned cop; Hathaway is a dutiful subordinate with computer skills, a university education, and a quirky sense of humor.  ""Inspector Lewis: Series 2"" is highly recommended to fans of Masterpiece Mystery Theater as good fun.",1255478400,4,1841,5.1

I think people should convey their protests in the strongest terms to PBS, but it hurts me to see the anger taken out on Inspector Lewis.
This series is an absolute treasure.  I own Series 1 and have watched every episode of Series 2.  Lewis and Hathaway are a fantastic team and the acting by everyone is incredible.  I was so inspired by the Shelley references in ""And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea"" that I bought an audio CD from Amazon of famous British actors reading the Romantic poets.  Since Lewis is a ""regular guy,"" it is great to have Hathaway explain many of the literary and musical references encountered in Oxford, and it serves as a great refresher course for those of us who left college behind a long time ago.  The Inspector Lewis series has murder, mayhem, outstanding acting, and an Oxford setting that is irresistible to this former English major.",1253836800,9,1368,4.647302904564316
3924660,3,B002G3DTSE,"1. Get a region-free upconverting DVD player from Amazon.com (USA). A 5-star-reviewed Pioneer DV610av is a bit more than $100. My discontinued Pioneer DV383 (not upconverting), also from Amazon.com, has been totally trouble-free.  It has done well with UK, German, and US DVD's in both NTSC and PAL encoding.  In fact, I plan to stay with it, because it delivers such superb image quality.

2. Buy ALL Lewis series released so far (1, 2, 3) UNCUT from Amazon.co.uk for about what ONE butchered series costs from the jerks in Bahstn. That's right, you get series 3 already. 6 - 10 day air shipment for about $5 is included in the price. The savings on the three series will almost pay for the region-free DVD player.
UPDATE: Shipment arrived just now, five business days after ordering.

3. Repeat for lots of other stuff butchered in Bahstn. Often it will be, as with the Lewis series, not only uncut and unaccompanied by gratuitous PBS twaddle, but MUCH cheaper. Your next order after the three Lewis series will complete paying for your region-free DVD player. All savings after that are gravy.

4. Then email PBS and tell them [use your imagination].

If you are new to amazon.ca, amazon.co.uk, amazon.de, amazon.fr etc., the process is almost completely transparent, astonishingly easy, working just like amazon.com:

Links to them are at the bottom of most Amazon pages.

They already know all your shipping and billing addresses, have all your credit card info, and are set up to email order confirmations and notification of special deals.

Currency conversion is painless, automatic, and at a fair rate.  Amazon bills your credit card in US$ so your card issuer can't rip you off.

Ordering Lewis 1, 2, & 3 from amazon.co.uk took far less than five minutes, just as with my first amazon.de (site is in German) order a few years ago.

You can use foreign Amazon sites to send gifts to loved ones and associates in other countries without worrying with customs declarations and postage from the USA. I have done it many times, often getting next-day delivery at no extra charge. European countries are, after all, about the size of US states and have more efficient transport networks than ours.

And PBS can [use your imagination].

UPDATE (30 Sep 09): Playback of the UK DVDs with the region-free Pioneer DV383 on a Sony Bravia LCD screen with 5.1 surround thru an Integra receiver with Infinity speakers and subwoofer, a 3.5 year-old system, was as close to flawless as my ancient eyes and ears can detect.  The improvement in image quality from an upconverting region-free DVD player would probably be so minor that I will not replace the Pioneer DV383, which also automatically detected the UK recording mode without help.  It was just as effortless as playing the best US DVDs on the same system.

Another bit of info that put PBS even nearer the top of my fetid list: The UK DVDs are a co-production with WGBH Bahstn, in the clutches of the ubiquitous Rebecca Eaton.  This completes proof that PBS KNEW OF AND EVEN HELPED PLAN THE BUTCHERY, GROTESQUE OVERPRICING, AND TWO-YEAR DELAY IN AVAILABILITY FROM THE BEGINNING.  The hundreds of dollars I used to contribute to PBS each year will now go toward buying better DVDs of their stuff at far lower prices on much better delivery schedules from the UK.

BTW, I do not plan to email PBS about this.  Their reaction would probably not be to clean up their act, but to try to block sales of UK DVDs of their co-productions to US customers, possibly via protectionist legislation.

NOTE (added 15 Nov 09): UK set 3's final episode, ""Counter Culture Blues,"" omitted from PBS Set 2, is superb. Joanna Lumley, 62ish but still captivating and screen-filling, especially in a more complex role than usual for the most mistakenly rejected of all RADA applicants, not so much steals the show as she enhances the usual fine performances of the regulars, as do other guest stars, such as Simon Callow (nude-swimming vicar in ""Room With a View"") and Perdita Weeks, 20ish sister of Honeysuckle Weeks from ""Foyle's War.""  According to a Guardian article, this episode, originally broadcast on an Easter Sunday, garnered top UK TV ratings, doubling most of the competition, as usual for recent Lewis episodes.

HOWEVER . . .

This last, and perhaps best, Lewis episode is MISSING FROM PBS SERIES TWO!  Much, much worse: According to Kevin Whately (source: ""Oxford Mail""), ITV may end the series in spite of its popularity in the UK, US and elsewhere.  PBS may someday release this episode -- long-delayed, crudely butchered, and grossly overpriced, as usual.  Owners of region-free players who buy DVDs from foreign Amazon entities already watched it -- uncut, cheaper, and sooner.

UPDATE (2 April 2010): HOORAY!! Not cancelled yet!!  I just pre-ordered Series 4 from amazon.uk for 16.64 ($25ish), including international air postage.  Release date 24 May; anticipated arrival date 1 June.  Meanwhile, has PBS ever supplied the final episode of Series 3?

UPDATE (1 October 2012): Now I have series 5 and 6 from amazon.uk. Meanwhile the PBS mullahs have started selling the uncut Brit versions.  I hope it is because of the abuse we heaped on them in these reviews.",1253318400,157,5211,4.8774120317820655
3924661,2,B002G3DTSE,"The Inspector Morse mysteries were perhaps the finest television mysteries ever developed. I loved Morse and enjoyed every episode and ultimately purchased them all in the complete DVD edition. The Inspector Lewis mysteries are equally excellent television. They are a fine successor to the Morse series and deserving of five stars and my firm recommendation. I would like to buy a complete set of these, too, and I may, but from Amazon UK. Then I'll have to buy an all-region DVD player.

So why did I rate this DVD set only two stars? As the other reviewer discovered and wrote about, PBS is cutting about ten minutes from each episode to leave time for the extra introduction and to keep the entire length at 86 minutes, leaving time for PBS commercials. Each Inspector Lewis episode in the British DVD sets (Region 2) is 93 minutes. Each episode in the PBS version is 86 minutes which includes the extra introduction by PBS host Alan Cumming. The PBS Series 2 run time is listed as 602 minutes because this includes seven episodes, the four in British Series 2 and the first three in British Series 3. The last episode of Series 3, Counter Culture Blues, is omitted.

But that's not all. Again, as the reviewer said, these Inspector Lewis sets are one or more years behind schedule for U.S. patrons. The complete Inspector Lewis Series 1-3 DVD set has been available in the UK since April 2009. Here's a complete list of what's actually completed and available:

Pilot
Inspector Lewis

Series 1
Whom The Gods Would Destroy
Old School Ties

Series 2
And The Moonbeams Kiss The Sea
Music To Die For
Life Born Of Fire
The Great And The Good

Series 3
Allegory Of Love
Quality Of Mercy
The Point Of Vanishing
Counter Culture Blues

The pilot episode is available by itself (in full length of 95 minutes) or as part of Series 1 with four DVDs in box. The other two series have four episodes/DVDs each. All three sets are available for less than $17 each on Amazon.co.uk, quite a bit less than the PBS price.

I strongly urge PBS to issue FULL-LENGTH episodes when they get around to selling the complete series box set.

Update (2009 October 8): I did purchase Series 1-3 of Inspector Lewis plus an all-region DVD player from Amazon UK. The process was painless, no different from ordering from the U.S. Amazon.com. I give these Lewis DVDs 5 stars. While the original Morse episodes were better due to the outstanding acting skills and persona of John Thaw, both Kevin Whately, who plays Inspector Lewis, and especially Laurence Fox, who plays Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, are excellent actors whose character relationship works well. There is no reason to rate these full-length episodes less than 5 stars.

Update (2010 April 28): Today I pre-ordered Series 4 from Amazon UK; it will ship in May. Needless to say, this DVD set is not available from PBS at all and the episodes haven't even been shown on PBS yet (but will be this summer as revealed by previews). A synopsis of each episode is available on the Amazon UK site. Here are the titles:
