1909391,4,B0000AZT6G,"Okay.  I have to admit that I was an AoStH fan first, SATAM second.  Please don't stone me.  I became familiar with SU only recently, and while I miss the old gang, this new series is definately rewarding for any die-hard Sonic Fan.  The characters are true to the feel and emotion of the SATAM, and even add elements to the action all on their own.  Manic and Sonia are like Sonic: brash, quick-witted, and even-quicker tongued.  It's worth every penny.",1081468800,2,454,4.54320987654321
1909392,3,B0000AZT6G,"I loved Sonic Underground since I first saw it. The show may not be Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog or the held-in-much-higer-regard Sonic the Hedgehog, but I find it to be a great show in it's own right. But we're reviewing the DVD here, aren't we?
Well, let's see... There are 3 episodes: Beginnings, A Hedgehog's Home is her Castle, and Mobodoon. Of course, most TV show DVDs like this only have 3 or 4 episodes. The thing that bugs me is that there's a bonus episode, but instead of Sonic Underground, it's an episode of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Why not include a bonus SU episode on this DVD instead of on the Mario Bros. DVD? You can also watch all 4 episodes in Spanish.
So that's it. 3 SU episodes, 1 Mario Bros. episode, and optional Spanish audio track. I suggest picking it up only if you're a major fan of the show. You can just as easily catch SU currently on your local UPN station (check your local listings).",1071014400,2,934,4.373563218390805
1909393,5,B0000AZT6G,"This is probably the most neglected show of the series, and gets a lot of critisism from across the board... but it really doesn't deserve it.
You can see right from first watching the show that an incredible amount of effort went into the creation of this series.  The artwork of the series is quite clearly top notch quality, definately SatAM quality, in fact I suspect it may be by the same people (like the storyline).  An incredible amount of detail went into both the characters and backgrounds, and all I can critisise if the fact that it sometimes 'moves' along *too* smooth... probably because it uses CG as opposed to the cells that cartoons used to use.  Another example of effort in this series comes from the fact that each and every episode has it's own 'song' which they sing... while many people critisise them for this, as it's kinda cheesy, it does show pure dedication, managing to write and record songs for all 40 episodes, and I can really respect this amount of work.
The place where this show falls down however is the fact that it is not very accurate to the games.  It deviates very far, and the storyline only bares a vague resemblence to the games.  However, it's still a very well written show and the new characters are excellent.  Manic in particular is a hillarious character, definately beating Sega's own other hedgehogs (like the Sonic rip-off that is Mighty... or Shadow, who is the biggest cliche since Cloud Strife), and is really the star of the show.  That said, Sonia isn't bad at all, although her voice leaves something to be desired.
Overall, I highly recommend this show.  If your expecting accuracy to the video game, forget this and go for Sonic The Hedgehog - Super Sonic.  However, if your after a top notch show, and want a bit of SatAM flavour with a twist, you just can't go wrong with Sonic Underground.  Give it a go, you just might like it!",1066089600,17,1895,4.579881656804734

1909396,1,B0000AZT6G,"It is just plain bad. I love Sonic and this really discouraged me of being a sonic collector. SO if you are just starting Sonic collecting, this is not the DVD for you. Start with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, or Sonic X. Because Sonic Underground starts a new bad Sonic story. It is just Sonic as a kid. And beleive me, when he was a kid... That was his akward stage. Singing the happy song? What the?! Where did that that come from. If Sonic ever sand, it would be in a rock band. I think Sonic Underground is just plain old bad.",1127088000,2,527,4.12621359223301
1909397,4,B0000AZT6G,"i think its a pity they didn't have tails and the voices weren't great but still i enjoy watching sonic, manic and sonia in their quests. also, manic is my fave sonic underground character and i think its funny in some places.",1098576000,,226,4.404761904761905
1909398,4,B0000AZT6G,sonic underground is shown on weekdays at 8:30 on UPN 9 if you don't know. its a good show because it shows you u have to work together with your siblings no mather waht.(unless they are sick in the head maniacs)the fact that they sing in every show is kind of annoying.overall its a good show and i think you should wacth it if you have siblings or are loooking for a good show...lol,1094860800,,384,4.202702702702703
1909399,3,B0000AZT6G,"Firstly, some of the comments about Sonic Underground DO have valid reasoning behind them
1. It IS inferior to the second Sonic cartoon, Sonic SATAM
2. It features two ""Mary Sue"" characters posing as Sonic's siblings, effecitivly making the hardcore fans of Sonic completly oblivious to thier roles in the series
3. It completly re-invents Sonic, he is now a musician in a band, a cover for his role as a freedom figter, and he is royalty, on the search for his mother (yes, his mother, covieniantly the former ruler of Mobius, give me a bloody break)
4. It makes no effort to be original, the above premise is only a SMALL tweaking of the entire plot of Sonic SATAM, Robotnik rules Mobius and the Freedom Fighters are in conflict with him
5. The theme song is TERRIBLE
But ""Sonic Underground"" has good points to it, throughout it's run, the series had some moments of true greatness
1. The first five episodes are very well written, give some insight into the characters of Manic and Sonia to associate them better with the audience, and has some emotional scenes.
2. Later episodes, such as ""The Crisis of the Chaos Emerald"" three-parter, features the first apperance of Knuckles and the Floating Island in an american Sonic cartoon
3. Sleet and Dingo are two bungling bounty hunters who are hilarious to watch
4. Sonic's humour has not been forgotten
5. The animation is brathtaking, and the sereis comes off as a genuine effort to make a good Sonic cartoon despite the apathy it recieved.
I'm more of a Sonic SATAM fan, but I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a hardcore Sonic fan, judge for yourselves if this is a work of art or a piece of crap, it is niether the former or the latter in my opinion.",1087689600,6,1714,4.568181818181818
7997903,5,B0000AZT6G,Great!,1444694400,,6,6.0
7997904,3,B0000AZT6G,"I liked the concept of Sonic Underground. An alternate universe where Sonic had a brother and sister, they were all musically inclined, and could use their instruments to fight Robotnik and save Mobotropolis. The songs were a bit strange, though. Some of them, anyway. However, the show didn't end! They never got their mom back, who was the original Queen Elena of Mobius, and they never got Dr. Robotnik, either. They just made some cheap ending with an explosion, supposedly with Robotnik in it, and Sonic said, ""Game over, Robotnik"". Fade to black. What kind of ending is that? If a series isn't finished, it should not come out on dvd just so the company who made it can make some money. It's not fair to the fans who spend their hard earned money on it, only to find out it's not finished. SO, aside from that, the animation is good, and the story is good, it's just an unfinished product. If you don't mind that, then you'll like this series. It's kind of an alternate take on the Sonic Saturday morning series that aired years ago.",1237766400,,1039,4.561497326203209
7997905,5,B0000AZT6G,"This is a great video.  It's long and high-quality, and you get a lot for your money!  We love Sonic, and this DVD is classic Sonic!
We've watched it again and again- I definitely recommend it!",1191542400,3,193,4.333333333333333
7997906,4,B0000AZT6G,"Okay, people, this is just my opinion - yes, I know the plot doesn't have too much going for it, yes, I know the songs get annoying, yes, I know that it throws in two completely new characters - but all that's been said.

When I watched SU, I was eleven. I *loved* it. Not only was it the only Sonic program on air in my area at the time, I genuinely loved the music, loved the songs, and loved the characters. Now that I'm older, I do see the weaknesses in the plot, and yes, it's not as good as SatAm plotwise. But it's  still a wonderfully entertaining program for me. I'll always enjoy it, even if only due to my old fondness for it.

The songs (and Sonia's voice) may seem annoying at first, but once you get used to them, they're not too bad. (Seriously, once they've repeated in your head about fifty times, you either go nuts or start liking them.) Plus, in my mind, Sonic made a cool Prince before I ever knew about Sally. So I recommend it, but still, ya gotta make your own decisions on what's ""way past cool"", ne?",1154995200,3,1025,4.166666666666667
7997907,2,B0000AZT6G,"Positives: It has better premise that makes sense relating to Robotnik. He takes over Mobitropolis and brings a new law and order. Those who violate it are roboticized instead of him trying to roboticize the entire world like in the Stam version. At least ten times better then ""Adventures of Sonic""

Negatives: Horrible charecters being cramed down your throught as Sonic's brother and sister, who are searching for their mom who for some reason is hiding. Even worse, hard rock music numbers near the end or during every episode. I wonder how thses three find time to coriograph a song when they are trying to thwart an evil dictator.

Tails is nonexistent which was the third thing that got me going.

At least ten times worse then SonicSATAM and no where near the american comic.",1154476800,,783,4.785185185185185
7997908,5,B0000AZT6G,I like it without Tails. Tails is got a really annoying whiny voice that pisses me off. Great stories.,1152921600,,102,4.421052631578948

Hearing Jaleel White doing the voice of Sonic again is music to my ears.
