4984040,4,B006E02GRK,"A charming French animated film about a pair of loveable misfits (one partnered with a very unusual truck named Catherine) who, bumbling about in the lab of an absent mad scientist, manage to turn a flea into a seven-foot monster that hops about terrorizing Paris.  The chanteuse who constitutes the romantic interest discovers that the flea, a sensitive soul, has also been given the gift of music - but just as she is encouraging it to pursue its talent, the evil police commissioner sets out to kill it.  Lots of delightfully funny parts; the touching parts don't move me much, but then I'm not French.",1338076800,3,605,4.752380952380952
4984041,5,B006E02GRK,"A gem I was glad to find.  Admittedly, it starts slow, so be patient  When the female lead first meets the ""Monster"" and the scene that ensues; that's when I fell in love with this film.  This is not a musical, but there are some musical and singing scenes that are very enjoyable.",1520208000,,281,4.264150943396227

4984065,5,B006E02GRK,A truly fun and adventurous romp through early twentieth century France when the Seine overran its banks and flooded Paris.  A mishap between a techno-delivery man and his theatre manager friend at a forbidden botany lab result in the creation of a monster who threatens all of Paris.  Or does it?

4984089,2,B006E02GRK,"What a terrible movie. That's time I'll never get back. I had an open mind going into it, but struggled to keep interested. I typically like animated movies like Penguins of Madagascar, Box Trolls, the Shrek franchise, but was bored through the entire movie.  The songs were OK at best and I found myself fast forwarded through the later ones just to speed up a slow movie. I didn't laugh once and my 8 and 10 year olds left early; it was that bad. The animation itself was excellent, typical of Dreamworks. Not recommended.",1482192000,3,524,4.574468085106383

Animation is good, the story is good, the songs are great. Not sure if you would classify this as an musical but you could. If you enjoy family friendly movies like Madagascar, Ice Age, or Hotel Transylvania then you will love this.

4984327,4,B006E02GRK,"Sometimes a film comes along and manages to dazzle so thoroughly that it really reminds its viewer of the magic and charm possible in the whole motion picture concept.  For me A Monster in Paris is precisely such a piece.  Despite oodles of hype associated with it since its initial release back in 2011 and fairly high expectations going in, I enjoyed every frame of the film and am left with renewed vigor for the unbelievably time consuming art of crafting quality CG.

A Monster in Paris is a 2011 French 3D animated musical adventure film directed by former DreamWorks director Bibo Bergeron based on a story he wrote.  Coming in at 87-minutes in length and wearing an appropriate PG rating (for some action-heavy scenes and gunplay), the film moves along briskly atop a beautiful soundtrack featuring the vocal work of Sean Lennon.

The story, which has been criticized for its sheer oddity, tells of a small group of cohorts in Paris circa 1910, shy and insignificant Emile (Jay Harrington) and his pal Raoul (Adam Goldberg) who inadvertently create a gorgeous-voiced monster by messing around with a professor of botanys litany of laboratory potions.  Oblivious to the panic theyve caused, reports begin surfacing of a monster terrorizing the citizens of Paris.

In time we discover that the monster isn't quite the malevolent creature the media is portraying when he encounters stage performer Lucille (voiced by the absolutely luminous Vanessa Paradis).  All the while the city commissioner, one Maynott (Danny Huston) sees opportunity to win over the publics affection (and hopefully votes) by slaying the monster.

Sure its a bit unique from a traditionalist sense, the story is actually a lot less convoluted in its delivery than it sounds in summary.  In fact, there are many small details integrated throughout that suggest mastery over the art of exposition (like one where the viewer actually witnesses the transformation and initial confusion through the eyes of the monster itself).

The animation and visual work, while nothing overly flashy or gimmicky, can be quite magnificent at times; particularly the soft hues and lighting that never allow the viewer to fully lose touch with the era of the piece.

The vocal cast is absolutely top notch; delivering performances that are spot-on for the emotions of the characters and as if their acting delivery weren't solid enough, the musical numbers (something I typically despise in contemporary animated films) are brilliant.  This could be one of few examples in the CG animated feature film segment where care in assembling a vocal ensemble went far beyond simply putting together a host of A-list celebrities in the hopes of their mere involvement boosting ticket sales.

The true heart of this tale is encapsulated in character interaction; beginning with the opposite mentalities of Emile and Raoul (which harkens back to some of the finer moments between Tulio and Miguel in prior Bibo Bergeron film The Road to El Dorado) and progressing to the interesting dynamic between Lucille and The Monster itself.

In the end, all of my acclaim for the piece is not without a few minor caveats.  First, the film doesnt particularly bend over backward in terms of cuteness, slapstick or other such gimmicks to hook younger audience members.  Rather, most of the humor here is classy and dialog oriented.  I personally am a fan of this approach, as an adult who has been forced to slog through countless mind-numbing animated films that keep youngsters entertained only through visual gags and cheap laughs.  This one will appeal to adults first and foremost, with kids likely becoming bored about midway through.  Though in all fairness there are charming elements like a sign-wielding monkey and a gadget-laden jalopy to break up the dialog-heavy sequences.  It is very reminiscent of the type of sophistication in childrens storytelling common in the 1980s 2D era (think An American Tail or Secret of the Nimh) but with far quicker pacing sensibilities for this ADHD generation.

My second complaint comes in the fact that both the blu and DVD release of the film are as absolutely bare-bones as it gets:  No behind the scenes, interviews, commentary tracks, nothing.  There is a trailer, some setup options and the feature itself.  If, like me, you usually enjoy exploring the personalities, inspirations and aspirations of the individuals behind the magic, be forewarned that very little exists of such things on the net and absolutely none on the disc.

All told, I thoroughly enjoyed A Monster in Paris despite fearing that a film about a signing monster bopping around turn-of-the-century France would never fall under my personal definition of cinematic brilliance.  What I came away with, however, was an appreciation for all of the subtleties and abundant attention to detail that make this one a most worthy example of how effectively the CG animated medium can be used to tell a character-driven story.",1412899200,,4979,5.092250922509225

4984391,3,B006E02GRK,"This film should have been really, really good.  It almost is.  But the main problem:  it seems that the director hedged his bets -- at least on the English-language version -- and over-Americanized this film to appease a New World audience.

First of all, why didn't most of the main characters have French accents at least while speaking in English?  That surely would have been more charming.  From what I remember, the only character that had an accent was the female lead, and I thought that her character worked really well because of it.

And there just aren't enough clever inside jokes to keep a truly adult audience interested.  While watching, I thought, ""OK.  It would be funny if, when the Flea Monster needs clothes, his 'friends' took him to a flea market.""  Sure, maybe it wouldn't have worked in all languages (does ""flea market"" even translate to French?) but at least I would have chuckled.  The first act, and maybe even the first half of the second, had just enough whimsy to keep my attention, but then by the third act I was almost ready to say ""au revoir.""  I just lost most interest by then.

It seems that this was supposed to be a play on ""Beauty and the Beast"" (BATB), but the screenwriter abandoned that idea when this film went tumbling down the stairs outside the Sacre-Coeur, just as our flea protagonist did the same.  I won't tell you what happens with the love interest eventually (I've complained a million times before that a film does not always need a love interest, and I'm complaining again) but let's just say it doesn't go the BATB route.  And it almost makes no sense at all how this ends; it feels like an afterthought, as if the screenwriter and director didn't know how it should end.

America likes to screw things up all over the world, such as introducing McDonalds into downtown Paris, and exporting drivel such as Disney wherever possible.  But really, if you're going to make a film about some French people, shouldn't it have some French style?  I'll give this a very disappointing ""bon voyage,"" as it's just another American misfire.",1392768000,,2088,4.673972602739726

4984403,5,B006E02GRK,"When I came across this movie on the Xbox Netflix app, the summary presented to me was something along the lines of ""A cabaret singer puts her career on the line for a giant flea"". I absolutely adore hilariously bad movies, and honestly, that's exactly what that summary sounds like. However, I was surprised to discover that the movie was actually VERY good!

The animation is lovely. It's easy to become spoiled by the intensely detailed animation of studios like Dreamworks, Disney, and Pixar. But this movie serves as a wonderful reminder that you don't have to be able to see a character's individual eyebrow hairs to know that the animators worked hard to make something beautiful. It's more stylized than realistic, and it's both beautiful and refreshing.

The music is fantastic. I have heard wonderful things about the original French music, so I would love to hear that at some point, but I have to say, the songs hold up very well in English! The lyrics definitely have a translated feel to them, but Vanessa Paradis and Sean Lennon's voices more than make up for that. Speaking of voices, the movie is also incredibly well-dubbed.

The story is very good. A little bit predictable in places, but that actually doesn't detract from the film at all. Even though there weren't any major twists or turns, I still enjoyed every second of it. And, being a long-time obsessed Phantom of the Opera ""phan"", it delighted me to pick up on little homages to that story.

I was thoroughly enchanted by the story when I finally sat down to watch it.  The plot is irresistibly preposterous, Raoul (a delivery man with an inventor's aspirations) takes his friend Emile (a movie projectionist) with him on a delivery to the Botanical Gardens.  Just shy of breaking and entering, the two barge into the facility and through (almost) no fault of their own, create a gigantic flea with a talent for music.  As luck would have it, a local politician (Maynott), with dubious aspirations of his own, seizes on the hysteria that a monster is roaming Paris.  He promises to eradicate the beast in order to curry favor with the frightened populace and thus become their mayor.  It's at that point one begins to wonder who the real monster in Paris is (and that he will stop at nothing in order to achieve his goal).  Yes, there's an exciting chase sequence on land, sea, and air.  It's wondrous.  This movie is a lot of fun.  It's also incredibly sweet and charming.

4984415,5,B006E02GRK,"I saw this pop up on NetFlix, wasn't sure what it was, I really had no desire to see it....Til my family popped it on.

First off the animation is top notch, attentions to details are incredible, amazing what you can do with CGI. Set, lighting, effects are all there, thus increasing the enjoyment.

Set in Paris in January of 1910, the Story revolves around an inventor/deliveryman, Raoul, and his theater projectionist friend, Emile.  Emile has the hots for a cashier at the theater, Maud, wanting to take the girl on a real date. Raoul delivers needed supplies to a local professor , but has to deal with the Professors handyman who happens to be a monkey instead, (Along with his endless and always ready supply of answer cards he flashes at everybody). Emile is testing a new motion camera and Raoul is acting out his scientist side and accidentally mixes two chemicals. Setting off a chemical explosion. Caught in the explosion is a ordinary flea off the monkey, and thus creating a huge monster but harmless that is the basis of our story. For part of the chemical reaction outside of making average plants huge, is to give the flea a wonderful singing voice. But the flea escapes the gardens and begins 'terrorizing' Paris.

Enter Lucille, lead singer at the Rare Bird Cabaret whom Raoul has a secret crush on. She encounters the giant flea and hears him singing to himself and offers the creature shelter and protection. And to disguise him from an over ambitious Police chief. Lucille names the flea Franceour  and when she performs on stage her song 'La Seine', Franceour joins in, much to the audience delight.

But the Police chief is determined to capture or better yet, kill ""the Monster"" and make a name for himself and actively pursues Franceoure.

I will not spoil more, but needless to say, a happy ending. My only regret is that in the English version, the voice of Franceour is played by Sean Lennon, where the original voice is by Mathieu Chedid, better known by his performers name of M. Chedid is no stranger to singing in English (he sang in Triplets of Belleville) It would have been nice to hear him instead, though Lennon literally sounds like him.

Lucille and Franceour's duet of 'La Seine' is perhaps the best part of the whole film.

My one complaint is that the DVD doesn't offer a French language with English subtitles to truly catch the feeling of the film.

But after watching this, I had to own the DVD. I highly recommend this delightful movie.",1381104000,3,2483,4.674311926605505

4984454,4,B006E02GRK,"In European animation, Bibo Bergeron is well-known for his directorial work in ""Shark Tale"", his work for films such as ""Bee Movie"", ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas"", ""Flushed Away"" and the TV series ""Caillou"", ""Babar"" and ""Woofy"".

In 2011, Bergeron and writer Stephane Kazandjian (""Modern Love"", ""Scalp"", ""Apres"") began working on the French CGI and 3D animated feature ""Un monstre a Paris"" (""A Monster in Paris"") which received critical acclaim for its music and performances by its lead talent.

The film would star Mathieu Chedid (""Tell No One"", ""Arsene Lupin""), singer and actress Vanessa Paradis (""Girl on the Bridge"", ""Cafe de Flore"", ""Heartbreaker""), Gad Elmaleh (""The Adventures of Tintin"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""The Valet""),  Francois Cluzet (""The Intouchables"", ""Tell No One"", ""Little White Lies""), Ludivine Sagnier (""Swimming Pool"", ""The Devil's Double"", ""Mesrine: Public Enemy #1) and Julie Ferrier (""Heartbreaker"", ""Micmacs"", ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"").

VIDEO:

""A Monster in Paris"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  First let's take a look at the 3D version of ""A Monster in Paris"".  The film is pretty much one of those depth-based 3D animated films that proves to be much more effective towards the latter half via the action scenes of the film.  It's not the best use of 3D for an animated film, but I suppose this goes to show a difference between a heavily invested Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks Animation 3D film would benefit from a larger budget.  For the most part, the 3D is OK.

As for the picture quality of the Blu-ray release, the film has a European style that is evident in British animated films, but for ""A Monster in Paris"", its strength is within its environments but also I like the French character design for its character models.  People should not expect the same type of animation as one would see on the more expensive, big budget animated films but by no means will I downgrade a film because of it.  I feel that ""A Monster in Paris"" is a beautiful looking film that shows that other countries can create beautiful animated films without the huge bankroll.  But also the film is in the capable hands of Bibo Bergeron (""Shark Tale"") which is a plus!

Picture quality does feature a lot of detail, some scenes are vibrant and for the most part, the film looks very good in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Monster in Paris"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While dialogue is crystal clear featuring Adam Goldberg, Jay Harrington, Bob Balaban, Danny Huston and Catherine O'Hara.  Possibly what stands out in this lossless soundtrack are the music performances by Vanessa Paradis and Sean Lennon.

The music is absolutely beautiful in this film and sounds incredible via lossless.  While the movie does utilize surround activity, especially moreso during the latter half of the film, its the environment that comes more to play in surround usage.  But for the most part, dialogue and music is crystal clear!

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Monster in Paris"" comes with trailer.

EXTRAS:

""A Monster in Paris"" comes with both the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy. Also, a slipcover case is included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""A Monster in Paris"" is an entertaining animated family film that I enjoy for its beautiful and well-detailed Paris environment, enjoyable character design but also for its music.

Of course, ""A Monster in Paris"" didn't have the luxury of a having a huge budget of a Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks animated film, and one shouldn't compare animated film from other countries with these big-budget films but still enjoy the animation and overall film.  The film is beautiful and its storyline is full of humor and fun.

For younger children, the sight of a flea-like monster may scare some younger children and as my son had commented, ""too many kissing scenes"" for kids.  But other than that, its PG rating is mostly for a scene involving a gun being shot by the film's antagonist and mild rude humor.

The film is in essence about three characters.  Raoul (voiced by Adam Goldberg) is a delivery man who has his own business but wants to make himself look successful (when he's really not) and wants to look very good in front of Lucille, an old childhood friend.

Lucille (voiced by Vanessa Paradis) loves singing but the Le Prefet Maynott (voiced by Danny Huston) is more interested in wooing her and wanting to marry her.  And her boss, Madame Carlotta (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), encourages it.  But she has no interest in the man.  But now that she has spotted the talented Francoeur (voiced by Mathieu Chedid), a flea monster, she wants to help him and perform alongside with him, as he makes her performances much more vibrant.

And Emile (voiced by Jay Harrington) is a projectionist who goes around with Raoul for his deliveries but he's a young man wanting to confess his love to Maud (voiced by Madeline Zima).

As for the Blu-ray release, the film is colorful and vibrant in HD.  The Blu-ray 3D is good for its use of depth but not the best in terms of animated films in 3D.  The lossless audio is also very good as the action sequences utilizes the surround channels quite well.  But the film's music performance is fantastic and Vanessa Paradis and Sean Lennon do a wonderful job.  It's only lowpoint for this release is you would expect animated films to have a ton of special features, not the case for this Blu-ray release.

One should not expect spectacular Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks Animation or a similar style with a magnificent budget to work with ""A Monster in Paris"", but one can expect very good animation and a fun family animated film for the entire family.

Overall, ""A Monster in Paris"" is a fun family animated film worth recommending!",1372896000,,5782,4.884102564102564

4984474,5,B006E02GRK,"When buying videos for your children, it is wise to be cautious,...

if only because you may end up having to watch anything you buy for them over and Over and OVER!  (""The horror!  The horror!"")  Movies you've all seen and enjoyed before are easiest.

Movies you have never seen before, cannot recall being shown (or shown very long) in theaters, and (especially) have NEVER HEARD OF before should sound alarm bells.  Such was the initial case for A Monster in Paris with me, but a local retailer was recently playing it on all the TVs in their TV department, and I stopped to watch a bit...

and found myself utterly surprised and enchanted into buying it.  In retrospect this film SHOULD have had an extensive US theatrical release because I believe it would have done very well.

In a 1910 Paris experiencing record flooding (even the Eiffel Tower is approachable only by boat) four friends/acquaintances/potential future lovers are about to experience an extraordinary adventure.  Emile Petit, a movie theater projectionist, is too shy to confess his feelings for Maud, the ticket taker, despite the encouragement of Raoul, his friend who is in the delivery business.  Raoul imagines himself quite the lady's man (he isn't) and a brilliant inventor as well, largely based upon his home built delivery van Catherine, which is chock full of remote controlled features.

One night while making a delivery to the Botanical Gardens accompanied by Emile, to an out of town Professor who has trained a remarkably intelligent (unrealistically, he communicates with written cards in a running gag reminiscent of the only funny bit in the otherwise awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pirates-Band-of-Misfits/dp/B0034G4P1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pirates! Band of Misfits</a>) proboscis monkey named Charles (Darwin, get it?) to be his assistant and in his absence a guard, Raoul decides to take advantage and start snooping around the Professor's laboratory.  The all too predictably disastrous results are to give Charles a beautiful singing voice, produce sunflower seeds that grow almost instantaneously into tree sized giants, and grow one of Charles' fleas into a seven-foot-tall monster, all of this recorded by Emile's new movie camera.

The now sentient giant flea hops all over Paris generating panic and a fiendish plan to take advantage of said panic for his political advancement by the odious Commissioner Victor Maynott before ending up at the stage door of the club L'Oiseau Rare (The Rare Bird) and scaring the wits out of Lucille, a childhood frenemy of Raoul and the star cabaret singer of the club.  However, upon hearing the giant flea beautifully singing a sad and lonely song about being viewed as a monster (ridiculous, but if you buy the premise, you buy the bit), Lucille invites him to hide in her dressing room, names him Francoeur (meaning ""honest heart""), and gradually discovers him to be a musical prodigy of astonishing talent.

But with an increasingly desperate and increasingly evil Maynott both hunting the ""monster"" and attempting to woo Lucille, just how long can she and her reluctant allies Emile and Raoul protect Francoeur?  A climactic struggle on the Eiffel Tower where Maud is awaiting the date Emile finally had the courage to ask her on tells the final tale.

The animation truly is beautiful as is the music.  Normally, I take a dim view of anthropomorphizing obviously dangerous animals in this fashion (fleas are blood suckers so if a seven foot tall flea were even possible, which it isn't, it would be a hideously vampire like horror), but Francoeur earns his ""humanity"" by heroism above and beyond the call of duty.  Fans of the French original will be disappointed by the decision NOT to include the French language track; for the moment the only Region 1 solution is to track down the Canadian version, which is not available in Blu-Ray.

Not to be missed!

Note: There are a couple of nice Easter eggs, extra little scenes showing the draining of the Seine flood waters and a punishment fitting the crime, in the Credits, so be sure to watch them all the way to the end.

Accidentally Conservative Movie Note: This is rather subtle, but there is definitely something interesting politically going on with the villains in this film.  The first villain is a snatch-and-grab thief; nothing very political there (at least not until the final Easter Egg), but the second villain is a sniveling cowardly weasel of a worthlessly arrogant and lazy waiter who fancies himself a (terrible!) singer of workers' protest songs, despite (or because of?) the fact he's never truly ""worked"" a day in his entire working life, an interesting apparent commentary.

However, it's the third villain, the main villain who really raises eyebrows.  It is not simply that he is a selfish and amoral politician entirely consumed with pursuing his own ambitions (rather than the selfish and amoral businessman entirely consumed with pursuing his own ambitions we might have expected), rather it is the fact that he is a narcissist of Caligula-like proportions.  Most politicians arguably have a bit of narcissism in them, but our main villain goes far beyond the norm into the area of clinical excess.  He not only wants the world to revolve around him; he appears to believe it actually already does, at a point in his career when it clearly doesn't.  Thus, he is prone to making the most lunatic narcissistic outbursts right out in front of people with the apparent expectation  that all who hear him will agree with him...

rather than have him locked up.  The thing is that if this character was intended as a parody of a real politician, there is truly only one world known political leader in living memory it could possibly be aimed at, a current one, one who actually responded publicly to acts of what can only be called pseudo-religious worship, not with the, ""You're creeping me out.  Stop that!"" you'd expect from any politician of any political stripe, but rather by BASKING in it and uttering narcissistic remarks only slightly less lunatic than any heard in this film.

Which brings us to who is IMHO the fourth villain, the main villain's assistant.  Despite hearing almost every single lunatic outburst the audience has, this toady remains loyal until said main villain has gunned his way across Paris, endangering innocents every step of the way.  At some point the Loyal Supporter becomes morally complicit in the Madman's plans, and Captain Pate cuts it awfully close.

Was it all just an accidentally conservative coincidence?  Or did the creators of this film demonstrate more guts than almost every other filmmaker on the planet?  Perhaps someday we shall know.",1370390400,4,6765,5.082278481012659

4984476,4,B006E02GRK,"I was stuck trying to find a movie for eight 8 yr olds for a birthday party.  Lots of kids have seen even recently released movies at the theater months ago.  By pure luck, a search on RottenTomatoes.com shows this blu-ray release.  Made in France in 2011, only released in the USA two years later, I had an almost sure movie that none had seen.  But is the movie any good?

The movie starts off at a fairly decent pace, with dialogue and some comedy used to help with character development.  While most of the characters are interesting and fun, they never developed any of them to an extent where you cared deeply about them.  However, in a <90 minute movie you're seldom going to get a brilliant script that can do such a thing.  The movies pace is very even going, almost like a car on cruise control.  The good news for your kids is their aren't many times for them to get bored, but it never really shifts into high gear either.  It's not an 'edge of the seat' type movie.

Without getting long winded, I would surmise this movie as fun and interesting.  I'd give it 3.5 stars - which is high praise from me.

It might help if you knew how I would rate other kids movies, to give this rating some perspective and to see if your tastes reflect my own.

The animation is very pleasing and refreshingly different than most animated films. The characters and French landscape are well illustrated in this charming and simple story.

The music stands out and the songs are quite catchy, which helps round out this sweet little film, but if I have one gripe, it is that they should have included the original French soundtrack for the dialogue and songs. I've heard both versions and prefer the original song soundtracks.

The combo pack is a little bit disappointing because of this as there are really no extra to speak of, a trailer ...that's it? If the French dialogue option had been included this could have been forgivable, but for a film that many Americans are not aware of, a making of would have been welcome as well as the addition of the original French soundtrack. This is an excellent film and deserves a little more than just a movie release. I should point out that the Blu Ray 3D and Blu Ray 2D are on one disc which is also a bit of a corner cutter, really how much so blanks cost....sheesh!

Overall this is a wonderful little film that is very clean with no adult humor, but I found the film more for adults than little kids, I think they will enjoy it, but it isn't as chaotic as most animated films and they may get a little bored?

4984500,5,B006E02GRK,"This is a delightful animated movie, with some fabulous jazzy music that's a cut above the sappy, commercial stuff usually featured in bigscale animated movies.

This flea is very warmhearted and has a beautiful singing voice, and so is befriended by a lovely Parisian singer and joins her show. A city commissioner with big ambitions takes aim at him however, hoping to inflate his popularity by publicly stamping out the 'monster'. Of course all of this sounds ridiculous, but it's pulled off beautifully, with references to Hunchback of Notre Dame, Beauty and the Beast, and almost any movie that has ever featured Paris. If you are sick of animated movies full of car chases and superheroes, and appreciate good music and Paris, you will likely love this.

4984507,4,B006E02GRK,"My wife knows that I am a sucker for musicals, or at least that is what she sees based on the fact that I still pop in Aladdin or The Little Mermaid from time to time.  Anyway, I had never heard of this movie and she only found it by chance and decided to surprise me with it.

The American release is through Shout Factory, not one of the big studios but the case is exactly what you expect from a 3D Blu-ray complete with slip case.  Inside they even went the extra step in that the cover has an image printed on the reverse side which is visible through the case itself when opened.  It's a little touch but I like it.  Inside is the DVD copy, the Blu-Ray 3D, and the unlock code to get a digital download.

As for the content itself, the animation is smooth.  Inevitably I end up comparing to a Pixar film and compared to modern Pixar the details are lacking slightly, the characters are simple especially the faces.  These are not bad things, in effect just a different art style as the animation is also very smooth and entertaining.  The film looks good and looks even better in 3D.  The 3D in this film never wowed me, there were a few scenes where character point of view was used in order to give the rollercoster effect but they were few and far between.  Overall though it was a nice background effect.

Characters save the villain were interesting to me.  Other characters had depth, complex motivations, but the villain didn't fit as he was too single minded.  I especially liked the titular monster, it's look and character made me wish they had spent more time on it's interactions.

As for the musical aspect of this film that made my wife pick it up for me.  Slightly perplexing is the lack of a French soundtrack, for the musical numbers I would have really liked to have heard them in their native composition, however the dub version is very well done and a pleasure to listen to.  I would be hard pressed to call this a musical in the vein of Disney musicals.  There is only one scene that really involves a character singing spontaneously.  That's not to say there is only one song, just that the others are parts of stage performances and not serving the role of allowing the characters to express their emotions or the plot through song.  But in the strictest sense with all the music in the movie musical does fit, just not Disney musical.

Overall, I liked the movie.  It was cute and fun to watch and I will likely pop it in the Blu-ray player from time to time.  The animation was fluid and the characters interesting.  The packaging and transfer were better than expected.  I am certainly happy with the gift and I think most any connoisseur of CGI animation would enjoy this film.",1367107200,5,2711,4.417338709677419

4984509,5,B006E02GRK,"You know, every time I watch a foreign country-made animated film that is great, and which is mostly ignored in the United States, it makes me angry and sad. It is a shame that the distribution forces of movies are not a plain-leveled field in our country, and the reasons for this are known and understood. Watching the delightful ""A Monster in Paris,"" a French production, I felt that way. It is one of those remarkable and passionate films that are totally family friendly, especially for children, which needs a wider audience.

The story takes in Paris during 1910, and we are immediately introduced to some majestic animation recreating that period. We are also introduced to Emile, a projectionist in a movie theater; Maud (the lady in the ticket booth, which Emile is in love with, but is shy to admit); and Raoul, a good-natured businessman of all types, who makes a living distributing merchandise from his truck all over the city. One day, Raoul is giving Emile a ride, and takes him to one of his stops, which happened to be a scientist's laboratory. Raoul wants to go inside the lab because he is curious about the scientist's work, and against Emile's wish, as well as the Scientist assistant's (a monkey named Charles), they enter the building. The lab looks like a forest, as the scientist likes to work with plants. Sadly, Raoul begins playing with mixtures and formulas in the chemistry lab, and accidently creates a giant flea, which escapes the building. The giant flee, it turns out, is very special, but the ambitious and egotistical police commissioner wants to kill it. It is up to Emile, Raoul, Lucille (a beautiful singer), and Charles to save the day.

""A Monster in Paris"" has everything that you want in a movie: a solid story, great characters, love and music, and state-of-the-art animation. The colors and attention to detail are astonishing, and you won't regret watching it. It is a little gem that deserves a second chance. The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy are the best deal ever.

4984514,3,B006E02GRK,"A Monster In Paris (Un Monstre  Paris) is a 2011 French animated film by former DreamWorks animator Bibo Bergeron (director of Road to El Dorado, and more embarrassingly, SharkTale). Yes, that's right, 2011. The film first released theatrically in France in October 2011, and then in the United Kingdom with the English dub in January 2012.
In April of 2013, OVER 16 MONTHS LATER, the United States is just now receiving an official release.

Which is utterly baffling, considering that even before the film's French release, A Monster In Paris went viral and gathered a cult following on the internet, with a large percentage of these fans American (myself included), due to the film's beautiful animation and music.
The music in this film is by Matthieu Chedid, better known by his stage name -M-. I became a fan of -M- and his music through A Monster In Paris. I now own three of -M-'s albums, having imported the CDs from France.

So you can imagine my disappointment when after over a year of waiting, I finally receive my official American release of A Monster In Paris on Blu-Ray/DVD, only to discover the original French language track is not included.
While I have nothing against the English dub, in fact the English versions of the songs are quite well done, the English songs swap out -M- for Sean Lennon.
Again, nothing against Sean Lennon, he does a fine job with performing the songs in English, but having become a fan of -M-'s music through this film I want to watch the version with -M- performing.

I ideally hoped to be able to watch this film in its original French with English subtitles, which I expect is how many others will want to view the film as well. Yet even though including the French language track in addition to the English dub and English subtitles seems like a no-brainer, Shout! Factory's failure to include such a simple but incredibly important feature is not only disappointing, but after a 16 month wait, is also unbelievably frustrating. I will without a doubt be sending in a complaint to Shout! Factory regarding the absence of the French language track, and I advise if you were also expecting to be able to watch the film in its original French with English subtitles, you do the same.

I love A Monster In Paris. It is an absolutely wonderful film that I highly recommend to anyone who loves animation, but because of Shout! Factory's negligence, I can only advise purchasing the American release of the film if you are fine with only the English dub (hence the 3-star rating). While the English dub is alright, I personally believe the ideal experience of this film should be in its original French with English subtitles. Unfortunately, the only way of doing this appears to be through importing the French Blu-Ray/DVD and then downloading English subtitles online, as the French Blu-Ray/DVD does not include English subtitles. Keep in mind however that due to region coding, the French Blu-Ray/DVD WILL NOT PLAY on most American Blu-Ray/DVD players. It will only play on a region free Blu-Ray/DVD player or a computer with region decoding software.

UPDATE: I've been informed that the Canadian DVD is multilingual, containing both the French and English tracks with English subtitles. Since Canadian DVDs are also Region 1, they WILL PLAY on most American DVD players. So importing a Canadian DVD would be a more simple, viable option for those who want to watch the film in its original French with English subtitles. Sadly for those of us who like our animation in high definition, there is no Canadian Blu-Ray, only a DVD. Importing the French Blu-Ray, finding a method of bypassing the region coding and then downloading subtitles still seems to be the only way of watching the film on Blu-Ray in French with subtitles.",1366070400,213,3776,4.828438948995363
4984515,4,B006E02GRK,"I have to admit that I didn't know what to expect from A Monster in Paris, a French production that combines story elements from The Phantom of the Opera, Hugo, Frankenstein, King Kong, Moulin Rouge and La Vie En Rose. If that sounds like a mixed bag, it is, but somehow director Bergeron and screenwriter Stphane Kazandjian make it work.

Even though the film recalls to mind some other works, it is one of the most unique animated features of recent years because it doesn't conform to the most common formulas, except perhaps after the leading lady (voiced by Johnny Depp's ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis) discovers the true nature of the monster -- and at one point, she says almost exactly the same thing Belle did to Gaston about who the real monster was.

What sets it apart is the delightfully odd character design, ranging from broad caricature to an almost Rankin/Bass look. More than that, this is not your garden variety musical film. There are very few songs, in fact, and most originate on a stage setting. But Sean Lennon, who voices the creature, sings some very unconventional songs (as does Ms. Paradis) that are hard to describe unless you hear them -- Danny Elfman but not as dark, The Beatles but softer, Edith Piaf without suicidal tendencies. The most conventional pop song comes at the end, perhaps the one designed for airplay as so many such songs are.

The music, like the dialogue, doesn't always stay true to the early 20th century French style so meticulously rendered in the visuals. Perhaps that was intentional too, as the story transcends its time and could have happened today as well as yesterday.

Before I get to the other characters, I have to mention Catherine, who is a rickety delivery truck so dilapidated it can't decide which way to fall. Catherine isn't anthropomorphic, yet she steals the scenes in which she rattles along. She is driven by insufferably narcissistic Raoul (actor/musician Adam Goldberg), with his shy assistant, the film-loving Emile (Jay Harrington of Hot in Cleveland).

The film does not rely on star voices. The most recognizable names in the cast are solid featured actors like Catherine O'Hara, Bob Balaban and John Huston's son Danny.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous, capturing both the color and the grime of urban Paris, and though released in 3-D it holds up well without it, as there aren't a lot of scenes dependent on it.

Sure would have been nice to have lots of bonus features, even if they had subtitles, as the Ghibli discs have. It is an artistically rich film and seeing a gallery might have been nice. There doesn't even seem to be a French language option. But budgets are an issue today, and it's nice to have the film anyway.",1366070400,3,2707,4.7837259100642395
4984516,4,B006E02GRK,"I must confess, I had a really hard time getting into A Monster in Paris. My kids did too and left after about half an hour of watching. For me, this was just when it started getting good.

I think anytime you watch a foreign film, there is that element of difficulty relating so it takes real genius to be able to cross cultures and reach the masses. Not only does the movie take place in Paris, it is also in the early 1900s making it even less relatable.

The plot is unique and I found the story to be quite adorable. The monster Franc receives assistance from an unlikely group of quirky characters to protect him from capture. While most see him as a scary monster, Lucille is the first to see past his exterior to what is within. What a great lesson to discuss with our kids!

The animation in this is amazing and it's one of those movies that make you feel you are in the city which is even more remarkable considering it's a cartoon. I feel like I've been to Paris now. Everything was so believable and the characters are endearing once you get to know them.

I also thought the music was amazing. The songs got stuck in head and Lucille's voice (Vanessa Paradis) is beautiful and spell-binding. When she opens her mouth to sing, everything stops. My kids even wandered back in when they heard it because it is so enticing.

A Monster in Paris is a great family film because adults will enjoy it as well. I think kids older then mine (3 and 5) will enjoy it.",1366070400,,1467,4.300724637681159

This movie is not what you would expect from animated films nowadays. The story is beautiful and, as an adult, I truly enjoyed the humor and characters of this film.

The music is phenomenal and really adds something special to this movie. I would recommend A Monster In Paris to anybody and everybody, if I could. It is and will always be one of my favorites!",1365638400,2,512,4.268041237113402

One of the things that I really liked was that even though this was not from a place like Pixar you still see a great quality film that you and your kids will love. Not only is the plot strong, but the movie also has a great musical track. All I can say is that now I have seen this I will be sharing it with others, as I had never heard of this film before (though I wish that I had) and more people need to know about it as well. If you love cartoons and musicals, definitely check this out today!

4984522,5,B006E02GRK,"Why don't more people know about this movie?!? I didn't know what to expect when I first heard about it. A movie about a singing giant flea in Paris? Not exactly a crowd bringer that's for sure. But if Pixar has thought me anything, it's to not underestimate a seemingly ridiculous concept. Plus I love animation and fell in love with the design of the female lead Lucille, so I gave it a shot.

The movie is fun to watch and an absolute joy to listen to. The music is phenomenal, mixing both the english and french languages. The animation is on par with anything from Dreamworks or Pixar and the characters, specifically Lucille and Francoeur (the flea) are cute and at times mesmerizing.

If you're hunting for a new animated movie that's very easy on the eyes (and ears), give this one a go.",1358899200,18,795,4.475862068965517
4984523,5,B006E02GRK,"When I first saw clips of this movie on YouTube, including the by-now-famous song ""La Siene,"" I was so impressed that I immediately began scouring the Internet for a US release date for the movie.  When I learned there were no plans for a US release, I was rather disappointed, but I wouldn't let that deter me from seeing this movie.  In the end, I splurged and purchased two copies of the DVD (one for myself, one for our local library) from Amazon's Canadian store.

Now seeing that there's an upcoming US DVD release, I'm kicking myself for not being more patient, but I don't regret having purchased this.  It's a beautiful movie, and while maybe not quite Pixar quality it's adorable and charming in its own right.

""A Monster In Paris"" takes place in 1910 Paris, during the flooding of the Siene river, and focuses on a short, shy theater worker named Emile and his eccentric, bombastic friend Raoul, a delivery man who fancies himself an inventor.  While dropping off a package at a scientist's home, the two break into his laboratory and accidentally create the titular monster -- a seven-foot-tall, anthromorphic flea who can only communicate via singing.  Said ""monster"" is taken in by Lucille, a nightclub singer who names him Francoer and disguises him as a musician, and soon it falls on her, Emile, and Raoul to protect him from a ruthless comissioner who will stop at nothing to rid Paris of the creature.

While the animation of ""A Monster In Paris"" isn't quite Pixar quality, I would put it on par with a Dreamworks movie, and it's certainly a cut above the animation of ""Ice Age"" and ""Despicable Me.""  The scenery shots of early 20th century Paris are gorgeous, and I never once saw a lapse in animation quality that was significant enough to jar me out of the story.  And the characters, with the exception of the appropriately villainous commissioner, are likable and quirky, with Francoer himself stealing the show -- who knew a giant flea could be so adorable?  The story of a group of people hiding a not-so-threatening monster from the authorities might not be the most original one in the world, but it doesn't seem old and tired here -- the new setting and the characters kept it from feeling stale.

By far the best feature in this movie is the music.  I LOVE the music.  Renowned French singers Vanessa Paradis and M provide the vocals, and do a magnificent job.  It was a song that led me to find and fall in love with this movie, and the music that remains the best part for me.

I watched this movie in the original French, with English subtitles (I always prefer to watch a movie in its original language), so I can't comment on the English dub.  I'll leave that for another reviewer.  UPDATE AS OF 1/28/13:  I recently re-watched this movie, this time in English.  The English dub is passable, but I highly prefer the French version.  The French voices sound more natural, and M makes a better voice for the monster than Sean Lennon.

Wonderful movie, with gorgeous music and little to no adult humor or innuendo.  I would recommend it for children 5 and older (due to some scary scenes) and anyone who loves musicals, animated films, or even lighthearted monster movies.",1358899200,60,3205,4.653641207815276

We watched it and totally fell in love with the music and the story itself. Un Monstre a` Paris is a family friendly movie about looking beyond our outer 'flea' shells and finding the beauty and love within us all. There are some crazy guys who get into some crazy trouble and create a monster that frightens all of Paris. However, a beautiful singer hears the monster singing (amazing singing voice) after they scare each other. She dresses him up in a stage costume to hide his scariness, and the two begin to grow in friendship over the love of music. There are bad guys, silly humorous scenes, and people learning to stand up for what is right, even if it's not what we think it should look like. All of our kids love this movie, so really with all of us together, this film gets 16 thumbs up!!! Can't wait for it to come to the U.S.",1343952000,,956,4.287292817679558
