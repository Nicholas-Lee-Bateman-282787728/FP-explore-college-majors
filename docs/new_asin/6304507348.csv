895795,3,6304507348,"Those expecting a pristine copy of this 1958 sci-fi classic should seek out Criterion's DVD (which Amazon also carries) rather than this no-frills budget version. For serious fans of ""The Blob,"" the Criterion version is the only way to go and includes two separate audio commentaries from producer Jack Harris and director Irvin Yeaworth, among others. Also included is a photo stills gallery of collector Wes Shank's Blob collection, including the famous red silicone masquerading as a man-eating monster from outer space.
For casual fans of the film, however, this version (from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, distributed by Front Row Video) is serviceable enough with VHS-like viewing quality. The source material isn't terrible, but is certainly nowhere near as crisp and clean looking (and sounding) as the Criterion version. It is the full-length version, however, and is presented in full screen (pan & scan). But that's all you get, there are no extras to be had, not even chapter breaks. You just slip the disc into your DVD player and it plays automatically.
Residents of Chester County, Pennsylvania (west of Philadelphia) may recognize a few of the film's locations including the Colonial Theater in Phoenixville and the Downingtown Diner, both of which are featured prominently in the film's climax. These cinematic ""landmarks"" are still in existence today, well over 40 years after the film was made.",999561600,37,1411,5.275555555555556

896034,5,6304507348,"If you are only watching, ""The Blob"" occasionally and you just want one for your collection this version will work. However for real Blob'rs I suggest the Criterion version.

Steve McQueen as Steve Andrews and Anete Corsaut as Jane Martin (also Helen Crump in The Andy Griffith Show) are negotiation in a quiet place in a convertable. When a shooting star lands quite close. Naturally this is more interesting and they go to investigate. An old man beats them to the sight and poking around gets blobulated. Things really get sticky from that point with none to believe them as kids don't know nothing.

Steve McQueen was my favorite actor.  And this was his first starring role.  I read later that he turned down a percentage of the gross for a flat fee of the movie.  And only made 1/12 of what he would have made if he had taken the percentage.
Anyway this is pure 50s Sci'Fi.  A meteor hits the Earth.  A farmer goes to investigate and this jello goo stuff gets on his hand.  Then goes from there.  As it grows it looks more like a trash bag covered with jello.  Steve McQueen was 28 years old in this and playing a teenager.

896315,2,6304507348,"The Blob, 1958 film

A young man and woman are sitting outside of town. They hear a whistling sound and see a bright object fall to earth. A dog barks, a man walks outside with a lantern. There is something in the rock, it gets on his hand. That old man asks to be taken to a doctor. Who is he? [There is no request for a co-payment for medical insurance.] Three young men are by Steves convertible, they want a race. Backwards! A police car arrives to question Steve. No more horseplay says Dave the policeman. The doctors find the swelling on the patients hand is spreading. Dr. Allen calls his nurse, he may have to amputate. The young people go to the North Road to investigate. The hear the dog and find the kerosene lantern outside. The patient disappeared! The Blob absorbed him! They throw acid on it. The doctor goes for his gun, nurse Kate screams! Steve and Jane return to the doctor, the place is dark.

They go and report to the police. Doctor Allen was killed! Steve says the mass keeps getting bigger. The police must go to check it out. The remaining policeman plays chess over the radio. The police arrive and find an empty house. Mrs. Porter arrives and talks to the police; she wants to clean up the mess. Elsewhere two auto mechanics talk about a hunting trip (where theyll be drinking). Then one screams! The fathers arrive at the police station for their children. The police will wait for morning and daylight. But Steve and Jane leave their homes in the night. Steve tells Jane he saw what happened to the doctor. Can people be warned? Can they find people to help them? Steve finds his three friends, they are at a horror movie (80 cents admission). Steve tells he saw that thing kill Doctor Allen. The police learn of a deserted business. They go around to warn people but are not believed. They visit a store and see the Blob! They flee.

Steve and Jane hide in the butchers freezer (we see sides of meat but no visible breath from them). Can they get away? Yes, they call the police. The sirens sound a warning around the town. Steve tells the people to drive home slowly. Do they have any guns? Get them. That market is empty. They hear screams from the people running away from the movie theater! The Blob moves around. The police will drop a power line on it so the electricity will kill it. It didn't work. The diner is on fire! They discover the Blob cant stand cold. CO2 fire extinguishers are gathered. The cars arrive with the fire extinguishers. There is a telephone call to Washington. They will send a big airplane to drop the Blob in the Arctic so it will never thaw. And so it ends.

There are two many dark scenes that distract from this low-budget movie. It is as best an average story and not too scary. The use of teenagers says it was to attract this audience. That horror movie in town featured Bela Lugosi who played in many horror movies in the 1930s and 1940s (he is best known for Dracula the classic vampire movie. The Eisenhower Recession of 1957 was followed by horror movies, so too the Ford Recession of 1974 (Jaws). That doctors office is in his home, the rule in those days. The nurse did not ask for a payment up front; things are different today. Did the 1968 movie The Night of the Living Dead echo this story?",1477267200,,3271,4.410596026490066

The idea doesn't sound that good (it's basically ""Invasion of the Giant Space Amoeba""), but I read a story by Joseph Payne Brennan called ""Slime"" that had a similar premise, and that was pretty good, so I decided to try ""The Blob.""

It's actually pretty solid from beginning to end.

The only problem is they keep calling  Steve McQueen a kid when he looks like he's at least thirty.

It's a charming, straightforward monster movie set in a small town in the 50's, with teenagers, hot rodding, and, for its time, a brand new movie monster: the flesh-absorbing Blob. The film has no blood and no graphic violence, and relies more on the viewer's imagination for the gruesome scenes of the monster devouring people. Yet when the Blob itself does appear, it is quite convincing and very cool. The special effects hold up surprisingly well today. The film also features a nice performance by Steve McQueen in one of his earliest movie roles.

The Amazon video quality was excellent; it was obviously based on a high-quality print. I also love the catchy theme song at the beginning of the film, something most sf films lack.

896876,5,6304507348,"The Blob is an interesting standard Sci-Fi/Teen/Horror film that is a cult classic.  It's first scene, with the ""kids"" in a convertible ""parked"" has been duplicated and parodied in many other works of culture.  This movie stars Steve McQueen, but by no means does it display the remarkable acting talents of the great, super-cool actor.

The teens are among the first humans to see the creature and nobody believes them.  As a result the story adds suspense by means of ""kids"" sneaking out at night to do some great feat.  This is a bit like comfort food, imagine living in a neighborhood so safe that one can sneak out all the time.

The most interesting thing to this reviewer was to see the technology of the time depicted.  The supermarkets of 1958 had auto-opening doors!  The fire department had old-tyme hoses and an old-tyme truck.

On the whole this is good clean fun, with pretty wooden acting.",1436140800,,904,4.707006369426751

896960,3,6304507348,"A small bubble of jelly tumbles dramatically from the sky, landing in the woods just outside Main Street USA, and swiftly begins absorbing and digesting the town's population. Naturally, the only ones to understand this predicament are a small tribe of no-good teenagers, and the crusty old grown-ups don't listen to a word until it's almost too late. It's a classic sci-fi trope, from the heart of Hollywood's cheap, silly, sci-fi boom, and that's always fun to watch to a certain extent. After jumping right in with a first-scene asteroid crash, though, The Blob loses its way fairly quickly, dragging its feet through all manner of slow, dry, window-gazing scenes while the monster gets busy somewhere decidedly off-screen. The attraction is a blob of man-eating goo, but the film seems more concerned with the history of kid-cop-parent relations in this sleepy little borough. It drags on forever, until it's suddenly time to wrap things up and then we rush through all the good stuff in a quick, delirious blur. It's in that quick, vibrant sprint that we enjoy all the best shots - a stampede to escape the theater, a fully-engulfed diner - but they're mere glances, and none seem blessed with the right amount of gravitas. The history books tell us that this was never intended to be a hallmark of the genre, and that much is clear. The studio didn't think much of it because, apart from a brilliant title and a far-leftfield concept, there really isn't all that much to think about. It's an empty, abrupt, stupid, yet inexplicably magnetic, time capsule. A short, simple novelty at the best of times.",1434931200,,1607,4.868613138686132

897054,3,6304507348,"The other day, on a whim, I decided to watch THE BLOB again after an interval of about 35 years. My first and only viewing of the film had come as a very small child, but oddly enough, I remembered much of it vividly and had the impression that it was a classic 50s horror movie which had helped launch the career of the then-unknown Steve McQueen. This turned out to be partially true. It did put McQueen on Hollywood's map, and it is a classic 50s horror movie -- of the distinctly B variety.

THE BLOB begins with Steve (McQueen) and Aneta (Jane Martin) doing the most American thing possible in the 50s -- parking in lover's lane in Steve's convertible. They witness a shooting star crash in the nearby forest, and, going to investigate it, discover someone has beaten them to the crash site -- a reclusive old man who foolishly poked the protoplasmic mass at the bottom of the impact crater and promptly watched it ooze over his hand. Taking the man to the local doctor (Stephen Chase), the lovers take off, thinking the episode over, but as it turns out the Blob has only just begun its rampage. Turns out it grows larger the more protein it consumes, and if there's one thing the anonymous little town McQueen lives in has plenty of, it's meat: recluses, doctors, nurses, mechanics, projectionists, theatergoers, and your little dog too. Putting this together much faster than anyone else is Steve, who spends a lot of time trying to convince the local constabulary that a monster is loose in the town; unable to make much headway he recruits his fellow teenagers, who rally to warn the townsfolk. By then, however, the Blob has grown to monstrous proportions and is threatening to consume everyone. Immune to gunfire, acid, electricity and fire, it keeps growing, and apparently has a sense of irony, for it eagerly sacks a midnight screening of some horror movies before trapping Steve and Jane in a diner. A way must be found to stop the monster before it grows too large to contain, and Steve has an idea, but will he able to share his theory before he's the Blob's next meal?

THE BLOB was an independently-made movie and obviously suffered from budget constraints. The writing is stiff, the acting is all over the place (the extras are all laughing and smiling as they flee The Blob) and even for the time the effects are not particularly good. And despite its modest length and extremely simple plot the film feels very slow, due to long boring and needless sequences which are everywhere in the movie and act as a constant brake on its pace, when what we really want to see is the Blob eating people. On top of this, the movie seems to be more interested in its 50s-era theme of ""teens vs. authority"" than the actual story, which is ""teens vs. The Blob."" And don't get me going on the theme song! Sounded more like a freaking Beach Blanket Bingo song than that of a horror movie.

On the other hand, the movie does have Steve McQueen, who even at his most inexperienced had that odd charisma that allows him to draw your attention even when he's staring vacantly into space, and I appreciated that one of the Blob's early nemeses, Doc Hallan, is a fully-drawn character the audience cares about, which is the last thing I'd expect to find in a horror movie, much less an old B horror movie. And the Blob is an interesting, even a unique, sort of monster. It has no intelligence, no personality, no motive other than to eat -- sort of like a college student who just smoked a big fat blunt. You can't sympathize with it, and you can't hate it. You just want to be elsewhere when it shows up.

In the end, I sort of wished I hadn't rewatched THE BLOB, because I remembered it as faster and scarier and all-around better. It's a classic B-movie, it undoubtedly set the scene for many future imitators, and I laughed out loud at the fact that it may feature the original horror movie trope of tropes -- the scene where the teen hero and heroine try to convince the bumbling sheriff that yes, there's a monster on the loose. Unfortunately it's too slow and boring to be really enjoyable. I don't mean to dismiss an iconic flick, but if you're in the mood for a proper monster movie from roughly the same era, you'd be better off watching THEM. At least it doesn't end with a question mark.",1424304000,6,4299,4.514762516046213

897399,5,6304507348,"You gotta love The Blob. It's seriously unique as a fusion of genres--1950's SF invader-from-outer-space flick meets 1950's-- teenage-smalltown- coming-of-age flick. The Blob special effects are actually surprisingly good, the characters are likable in a Mayberry kind of way (complete with a disbelieving deputy who's more of a control freak than Barney Fife), and hey, it's fun.

So overall it holds up well. Technically the original low-budget film stock is not super high quality, so visually this is not some modern HD feast for the eyes. Just know that up front and you won't be disappointed.

This is a wonderful period piece of Norman Rockwell Americana. A small town where people care about strangers they meet, where seriously injured people are driven to the Doc's home office/clinic (he makes house calls, too), where kids drive Model T Jalopy's and all the ablebodied menfolk of the town turn out to help in an emergency.

The great and lasting appeal of The Blob is the viewer gets to spend some time back in that wonderful vanished America. And that alone is worth the price of the DVD. As a bonus, you get the goofiest, most incongruous bossa-nova theme song ever written for a horror movie.

Hope this is helpful. Happy viewing, everybody.",1410566400,,1256,4.966666666666667

I love The Blob 1958 but there was no care put into this DVD release however the film quality is quite good. I don't care about there being no special features but I care about there being no scene selection. I will not be buying the criterion collection dvd any time soon because I buy a dvd mostly for the main feature and this dvd does have a vhs type feel that I like. The DVD gets a 2 stars while the actual film get's 5 stars out of 5.

THE BLOB comes to life in the 1958 classic, a film which redefined the Horror film for a whole new generation. The Blob is no ordinary villain, but a shapeless monster made of molten acid that devours anything in its path. We watch in suspense as the creature oozes its way under doors and through vents, never knowing how or when it will strike next! The characters also speak to the youth of its day. Rather than giving us scientists and army officials to face off with the alien menace, we are teamed with a group of rebellious teens led by a young Steve McQueen in his first starring role. When the authorities don't believe their stories of a killer glop, they take it upon themselves to save the town! This gave the throngs of 50's youths someone to root for as they packed the theaters every weekend. The horror in THE BLOB is also very edgy for its time. We see the creature begin to devour its victims by spreading over their bodies, and we reel in terror when it oozes over the diner, spelling doom for each of the characters inside. THE BLOB also features fantastic special effects that give the amorphous jelly a life of its own. Heed the warnings of the opening theme song and ""Beware of the Blob!""

898147,4,6304507348,"Seriously, what else can be said about any 1950s classic horror film? It is without a doubt Steve McQueen's brightest moment in his career. Movies such as this prove that film-making really cannot be TOO realistic, in terms of whether the happenings in the plot are things that could really happen in real life.

A rock of unknown origin falls to Earth. An old man investigates it to find a mysterious and shapeless organism inside, and later becomes the creature's first meal. It moves on, devouring person after person, growing larger every time. It takes a while for Steve Andrews (McQueen) and his girlfriend to convince everyone what is going on, and once they find out that the creature can't stand the cold, they freeze it with a mass supply of fire extinguishers, it is taken up to the north pole where it will stay cold... or will it?

This classic horror flick is simply an amazing work of art from the glory days of horror films, and of movies in general. The sequence of events, along with the dialogue, keeps the spectator glued to the screen, eager to find out what happens next. However, the only thing that forces me to knock off one star is the fact that a better job could have been made of transferring the film onto the DVD itself. It does skip in some areas, but other that, it isn't so bad.

THE BLOB is an asolute must see film for a Steve McQueen fan. Here is Steve McQueen's first starring role as Steve Andrews. Young and fresh looking. it is the beginning of a long and highly successful film career for McQueen. It is worth watching Steve as he starts his journey to being THE KING OF COOL. It is also fun to see a young Aneta Corsault later known on TV on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW as Helen Crump, Andy's schoolteacher girlfriend. She starts out weak in her role as Steve's girlfriend but becomes more comfortable in later scenes.
THE BLOB has become a cult classic and I wonder if Steve McQueen ever expected this film to be as successful as it was. I did watch the budget version of this film.

So now that the Blob is in Antarctica or Arctic Circle, what about a sequel?  You know, the popular (but false) ideas on global warming might make a good follow-up cause for the Blob to seep down south or up north.  Could do a lot with the subplots, too.

What defense do we have, even now?  What if the Blob got used to the cold after all that time, so it can't be stopped if frozen, now?  What if it took on human form?  Or some other shape?  What if some alien extra-terrestrial found it and harnessed its power?",1311897600,,894,4.392638036809816

898256,4,6304507348,"As a junior (back in 1958) at Spring-Ford High School just a few miles from Phoenixville, PA and the rolling hills of historic Valley Forge, I wish I had more appreciation (at the time) for what many of my classmates and I really experienced, when an independent film company began shooting ""The Blob."" We knew something big (anything was ""big"" for us, in those days, in this small-town environment) was happening, and some of us were fortunate (especially with hind sight) to actually watch as scenes were shot. A few of my friends were actually ""IN"" some of the scenes.

You'll recall the monster killing the doctor who had remained behind (from leaving early for a medical convention) to care for the ""old man"" (played by Olin Howland -- perhaps he most familiar face in the movie -- he was in so many films in those days). Well, the actual buiding (a converted house and office) was the site of a real life chiropractor (who took care of my Dad's low back pain brough on by working in a local foundry).

The scene at the supermarket (actually Jerry's Market), where the Blob was captured in the freezer, was shot in nearby Royersford. The parking lot scene was fun for me, since the father of a girl I was dating at the time, is prominently seen standing among the crowd of civilians, fire fighters and police -- in his PJ's. Today, the building remains, and is a combination of things, including The Sly Fox (restaurant and bar).

The night that Steve McQueen's car race with the other boys, who end up helping track down the monster, was filmed, me and a couple of friends were able to sit off the street, quietly and watched as it was filmed and refilmed and refilmed. At the time, we had no idea that one day this kid would be driving his own stunt scenes in ""Bullit."" (And none of us would have expected to see his co-star becoming the school teacher, Miss Crump, and dating Andy of Mayberry.)

A couple of friends from school were ""kids in the balcony"" scene, who end up running and screaming as they fled The Colonial Theater onto Bridge Street, where the Blob has entered the projection booth, killed the projectionist and was ready to dissolve a few high schoolers.

I was always impressed that the independent company who made the film, had been on the financial edge. Their earlier productions -- Christian oriented films for churches, had been producing sufficient revenue. The compnay needed  shot in the arm...and one of the producers told local newspeople that they ""had attempted to bring Christ into the lives of people...and were now going to concentrate on scarring the Devil out of them.""  Some of the buildings used in the editing and final production of the movie can still be seen in the nearby village of Chester Springs (a few miles outside of Phoenixville, near Valley Forge).

I keep a copy of ""The Blob"" handy in my family room, and have never hesitated to spring on newbies who drop by for a visit or party. Every one of my friends has been exposed to this movie.

It's a great feeling having this small part of movie history part of my teen years. When my high school friends gather (for reunions, for example), ""The Blob"" is always part of the reminiscing. Some who still live in the area attend the annual Blobfest.

While this movie is no masterpiece, it is however a fun flick to laugh at. Practically the acting is very Low budgety. You can tell the actors are not taking the movie seriously in any way....I mean come on it's a freaking 50 ft piece of jelly...how serious can you get.

Anyway let's fast forward to 2007. I ordered this movie and the memories are still in tact! You have a group of teenagers trying to save their town from menacing goo threatening the population. Steve McQueen delivers a good performance in one of his earlier works. As for the theme song, it was written by two of the legendary songwriters of the 1960's and into the 70's Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Hard to believe they composed it but you know the rest of the story about these two song writing legends. The music in The Blob was composed by Ralph Carmichael who today is one of the leading Christian contemporary music producers. The Blob...good sticky fun for 80 minutes!

898372,5,6304507348,"Many fans of this movie prefer the remake from 1988, viewing it as scarier.  I do not.  As a writer, I have to admire Irwin Yeaworth, Jr.'s(writer/director) vision, attention to detail and sound story structure. He accomplishes one of the most crucial elements of structure, placing characters in conflict, in only 82 minutes, as opposed to the 1988 version's 95, in which the bad acting and familiar faces (Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon) overshadow an otherwise great adaptation of the original story.  Yeaworth keeps the tension on the story's teen hero and heroine Steve and Jane (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) as they try to convince the skeptical townfolk that a murdering, geletanous blob is on the loose.  The creature here is horrifying, without all the silly special effects. It is both malevolent and intelligent all at once.  One ponders ""What could possibly be a more terrible death?"" as the Blob oozes across the floor with poor Nurse Kate's remains digesting in its innards.  Although the original Blob has its own moments of bad acting, the movie as a whole is sound, keeping the fear factor high as wholesale panic breaks out when the Blob emerges from a movie theater having dined on at least 50 or 60 theater-goers by Police Officer Dave's count, and then engulfs a diner, trapping our heroes inside, leaving them awaiting their own slow and gruesome demise.

FYI -- the sequel Beware the Blob, directed by Larry Hagman of I Dream of Jeannie fame, has got to be one of the worst pieces of cinematic poo ever made.  Don't know where he was going here, but he certainly never made it there.  Don't waste your time!

Overall the inventive story, great bad acting and near flawless elements make the Blob (1958) a timeless and unsurpassable gem in the anals of movie history.

898446,4,6304507348,"First off, be aware that this is a cut-rate DVD version of ""The Blob,"" the greatest 1950's camp science fiction film. There is a Criterion Collection edition of ""The Blob,"" and that is all that needs to be said to indicate to you which one you want to pick up. The Criterion Collection edition of ""The Blob"" is loaded with enough DVD extras to make watching the film itself only half the fun. So if you are a big fan of this classic horror flick, then this is not the DVD edition that you want to pick up (unless, of course, you just want to watch the movie; but why would you want to do just that?). Not only is the Criterion version superior, this DVD could be judged inferior all by itself without another point of reference, so be warned. The film is a five, but this DVD is a three (at least it is widescreen), so split the difference and make the right choice instead of flipping a coin to decide which version to get.

""The Blob"" is quite simply a cult classic film, with Steve McQueen (!!!) in his first starring role taking on a Jell-O like creature from outer space out to eat everybody in its path. Or, as the tagline put it in 1958: ""Indescribable... indestructible... insatiable!"" You cannot do much better than that. McQueen is young Steve Andrews, who leads his friends against the Blob when the local sheriff and the other adults refuse to listen to the truth (just think of him as rebel with a real important cause). The movie ends with a climactic confrontation at the local movie theater. No wonder everybody wanted to see this one at the drive-in; you were safer there. Then again, this would have been a great date movie either place as it would be sure to send your creeped out girl friend into your arms for safety.

""The Blob"" has always had a special place in my heart because they actually showed us this movie in high school (along with ""Carousel"" and ""Thoroughly Modern Millie""--please do not try to find a common denominator between those films, you might hurt yourself). I have no idea why they would do show us this film from an educational standpoint (Bad things happen to bad kids? Do not go to the movies to make out?), but it remains a cherished memory of those halcyon days. Larry Hagman directed a lousy sequel/spoof in 1972 and then there was a less than distinguished remake in 1988. Taken together they are not as much fun as the original Blob.

""The Blob"" really scared me as a kid.  Its a great classic 50s sci-fi film.  It doesn't scare me anymore, but its still fun to watch.

Steve McQueen made this movie before he was a star.  He needed the work and money.  I have read and heard that Steve McQueen was offered either a flat fee or a percentage of the box office.  He took the fee because he thought the movie was a clinker and he and his wife thought no one would see it.  ""The Blob"" became a huge hit and a cult classic that made millions.  McQueen regretted not getting a piece of the movie and fumed about it the rest of his life.",1130025600,,748,4.096551724137931
898448,4,6304507348,"First off, be aware that this is a cut-rate DVD version of ""The Blob,"" the greatest 1950's camp science fiction film.  There is a Criterion Collection edition of ""The Blob,"" and that is all that needs to be said to indicate to you which one you want to pick up.  The Criterion Collection edition of ""The Blob"" is loaded with enough DVD extras to make watching the film itself only half the fun. So if you are a big fan of this classic horror flick, then this is not the DVD edition that you want to pick up (unless, of course, you just want to watch the movie; but why would you want to do just that?).  Not only is the Criterion version superior, this DVD could be judged inferior all by itself without another point of reference, so be warned.  The film is a five, but this DVD is a three, so split the difference and make the right choice instead of flipping a coin to decide which version to get.

As the hyperbolic title of this DVD version indicates, this is a cult classic film, with Steve McQueen (!!!) in his first starring role taking on a Jell-O like creature from outer space out to eat everybody in its path. Or, as the tagline put it in 1958: ""Indescribable... indestructible... insatiable!"" You cannot do much better than that. McQueen is young Steve Andrews, who leads his friends against the Blob when the local sheriff and the other adults refuse to listen to the truth (just think of him as rebel with a real important cause). The movie ends with a climactic confrontation at the local movie theater.  No wonder everybody wanted to see this one at the drive-in; you were safer there.  Then again, this would have been a great date movie either place as it would be sure to send your creeped out girl friend into your arms for safety.

""The Blob"" has always had a special place in my heart because they actually showed us this movie in high school (along with ""Carousel"" and ""Thoroughly Modern Millie""--please do not try to find a common denominator between those films, you might hurt yourself). I have no idea why they would do show us this film from an educational standpoint (Bad things happen to bad kids? Do not go to the movies to make out?), but it remains a cherished memory of those halcyon days. Larry Hagman directed a lousy sequel/spoof in 1972 and then there was a less than distinguished remake in 1988. Taken together they are not as much fun as the original Blob.  But then what in this world would be?",1125100800,5,2437,4.446188340807175
898449,3,6304507348,"This DVD has a great price, but the quality doesn't compare with the brilliant Criterion release. The picture is soft and the color murky in this print. After having watched this edition numerous times, I was amazed when I watched the Criterion release and saw all sorts of details that simply aren't visible here. This version also is missing a few bits of the film, though not enough to really alter the story.

For those just interested in checking out The Blob, this low priced DVD may be fine. If you love the film, by all means spend the extra money and pick up the beautiful Criterion Collection print.",1123113600,39,609,4.587155963302752
898450,5,6304507348,"In this campy thriller, small-town teens Steve (Steve McQueen) and Jane (Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite land nearby and go off to find it.  Before they can, however, an old hermit finds the strange little ball, pokes it, and out comes an oozy, jelly-like substance that proceeds to attack and consume him.  Steve and Jane take him to a doctor, who becomes the blob's next victim.  The blob grows bigger and bigger and slides all over town looking for prey.  Steve tries to convince the local police of this horror, but no one believes him (""Kids!"").  With the help of all of the town's teenagers, Steve finally gets the adults to listen to him, but will it be too late?

This low-budget thriller is a nostalgic favorite of mine; it showcases the innocence of 50s horror flicks and the wholesome morals of the day. Steve McQueen was 28 when he played 17-year old Steve and was hampered by stilted dialogue, but his charisma is undeniable and watching him in his first big part is a lot of fun.  Many of the smaller parts went to non-professionals, which also emphasizes McQueen's talent and screen-presence.  He is the whole show, and he takes it all so seriously, that you just can't help but get involved, too.  It's a fun movie!

898528,5,6304507348,"This is the apex of '50s sci-fi camp.  Quite correctly, amazon.com has this listed as Sci-fi/Comedy.  Unlike many old sci-fi flicks that take themselves seriously, this film goes with the goofy flow, and occasionally laughs at itself.  An indestructible mass from outer space absorbs humans, and grows gigantic.  One great moment is the scene at the local theater.  As the teenagers sit, engrossed in a spook show marathon, the gelatinous mass gobbles the projectionist and oozes through the projection room windows.  It dribbles through the theater and out the double doors into the street, finally causing mass panic.  This movie memory is part of '50s baby boomer folklore.  Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut run around town trying to persuade the adults that a monster is on the loose, and, no, it's not a teenage prank.  The chasm separating adults and teenagers impedes the kids' ability to serve as the community's monster-attack warning system.  The adults in this movie are straight from the ""Ward and June Clever"" profile.  Another hilarious moment unfolds thus:  running out into the street in his sleeper PJs, Ignatz (or is his name Danny?), Corsaut's annoying little brother, fires his cap pistol at the Blob.  When the caps are gone, the kid throws the toy gun at the monster, the old movie Western standby.  The snappy little rock-n-roll song above the opening credits sets the proper mood.  The oddly effective blend of spine-tingling suspense and bizarre humor make this one a winner.  Great fun for collectors and nostalgia buffs.  ;-)",1025222400,3,1551,5.067193675889328
898529,3,6304507348,"By the mid 1950s, it was pretty much taken for granted that the youth of that decade were little more than an undisciplined, unruly horde of kids who preferred to raise hell every Saturday night.  The rock and roll lyrics of Elvis and the black leather outfits of bikers in films like THE WILD ONE stood as ikons for an entire generation of boog-a-looing teenagers.  THE BLOB was one of the few films of that era that dared to buck this trend by portraying teens in a more intelligent, more perceptive light.
  Steve McQueen plays Steve, a teen who has the same sort of parents that James Dean had in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  They are totally dense about who their son is and what his generation can do.  Steve's girlfriend is demurely played by Aneta Corseaut, who went on to fame as the girlfriend of television's Sheriff Andy Taylor.  The plot begins with the fall to earth of a meteorite that is poked and prodded by the kind of country bumpkin that the audience is shouting at not to do that, but he does.  A slimy gooey slithering mass of red jello attaches itself to his arm.  Steve finds this poor unfortunate and brings him to the local doctor who also winds up as the blob's latest meal.  As the blob eats, it gets bigger.  The fun starts when the teens, led by a very earnest-sounding Steve, try to convince the town that it is in imminent peril.  Of course the elders of the town ridicule his claim of a rolling blob of carnivorous jello.  It is only when the Blob enters a movie theater and begins to swallow the patrons that the sheriff believes.  By sheer luck, Steve and his girlfriend discover that intense cold is the key to killing the creature.  The blob is quickly killed and a sense of normalcy returns.
  What makes this movie a period piece is the outer show of portraying teenagers as wild and irresponsible, but as the movie gets to the midway point, it is the adults who refuse to believe the evidence of their senses.  Further, it is the teen Steve who discovers how to defeat the creature and it is Steve again who actually does defeat it.  This movie is great fun to watch, not just for its spectacular special effects (well, for that decade perhaps), but also for the subtext that suggests that there is hope that the next generation will grow up to be more perceptive and more believing than their predecessors of the 1950s were.  Unfortunately, the next generation were the potheads of EASY RIDER, but we cannot fault the cast and crew for that.",1024358400,3,2477,4.474387527839643

even the SFX of it's time was top notch.
The plot is simple. A meteor crashes near this old man's house and being curious as 98% of people are, he goes to investigate.
Well next the old guy ends up with the alien jellylike substance on his hand, he promply runs in front of Steve McQueen and his girlfriend Jane.
So you can figure out what happens next, the blob absorbs most of the smalltown. For those of you people who haven't seen this movie
i'll stop here but you'll see the simple way the people incapacitate the predacious protoplasm and save their town
I recommend this movie.",1018051200,,652,4.487394957983193
898531,4,6304507348,"Who would think Andy Griffith's ""Helen Crump"" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past?  But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would shortly decide that ""Steve"" sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut.  It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left.  But will the grown ups believe them?  Of course not, what do they know, they're just kids!
The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best.  The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the ""adult"" supporting cast probably says ""Kids!"" very third sentence or so.  But the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense.  And although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniture sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophistocated ""grown ups only"" get together.
