7295884,5,B00ZWZE4OG,"Great continuation of BP1. There are quite a few cringe moments within the first half hour, I wasn't sure how to take that, but if you're a fan of NOFX, you'll appreciate their honesty. Where the first one was more ""fluffy"", for lack of a better word, this one shows the (sometimes) very ugly truth. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of GREAT uplifting moments involving Mike and some female senior citizen widows, good performances, some classic El Hefe and done all around NOFX and co. high jinks. 5 out of 5.",1440460800,3,513,4.526881720430108
7295885,4,B00ZWZE4OG,"I thought that this was based on more recent footage but it's set in 2008 shortly after backstage pass 1. The narrative is more of the same from bp1 and nofx's general reputation. It is a bit more dark than bp1, especially fat Mike's glorified substance abuse. He is a complex character. I honestly did not know how to feel about him after this and bp1. He is hilarious at times, petulant others. As a long time fan, observing the band in their environment (and out) was fascinating. There is a bit more actual live music as opposed to recorded tracks played over the live shows, which was nice.",1440288000,7,595,4.467889908256881

8721070,4,B00ZWZE4OG,"I really enjoyed this, actually much more than the first series. Perhaps because I just finished reading Hepatitis Bathtub, which tells some of the same tales. Solid viewing over a few beers.",1505520000,,191,5.0

8721075,5,B00ZWZE4OG,I recently watched the first season of Passport after learning of a second season. I was just left wanting more. The honest story telling and an inside look into touring is a must watch for any music fan. One doesn't have to be a fan of NOFX to enjoy this. I hope they figure out a way to do a third one.,1445126400,,304,3.9193548387096775
