2211477,4,B0007G8W7U,"I have tried other workout tapes, but don't know anything about samba dancing. But it sounded fun and I thought I'd try it. It is fun -- and it's so easy to learn. And the routines work every part of your body.",1111017600,2,210,4.023809523809524
2211478,4,B0007G8W7U,"I got this DVD because I wanted something new in exercise. However, this is more than an interesting and easy-to-do exercise video, it has steps you can actually use on the dance floor at the clubs. Thus, it's kind of a two-for-one deal!",1106352000,2,237,4.534883720930233
8047125,5,B0007G8W7U,"I've always loved Brazilian samba.  Since my interest in Brazilian culture began around 1991, I've always attempted to try dance the samba, poorly mimicking the Brazilian Carnival dancers on television programs, and what I've recorded on the vcr.  Yet, I never gave up.  As time passed, I found myself getting slightly better at it.

When the SamBody dvd was released in 2005, and I caught the preview on the SamBody.com website (now, a dead link), I knew I had to have this!  With this dvd, not only have I improved on dancing Brazilian samba (or 'samba no pe'' in Portuguese), but I get a good workout at the same time.  I end up drenched in sweat.  My arms, knees, legs and, in particular, my calf muscles are pretty tight and sore from the samba's rapid movements.  My hips and waist get a pretty good workout, as well.  You do feel sore the next morning.  The Brazilian Carnival music and percussion is enough to get you moving!  Instructor Edilson Lima is fun, and breaks down the moves to help you learn it.

I easily picked up on the Basic Step of the samba, as introduced in the Warm-up segment.  For the four exercise routines, in separate segments, I learned the moves gradually.  In the 'Slap and Swirl'/'Booty slap' segment in Routine 2, I modify this by placing my hand on my hip, instead; then swirl (I'm kinda modest, folks!).  The fourth routine is quite swift that I have to repeat the segment a few times to keep up with it.  And I finally attempted to dance the Batucada, which is a faster samba.  However, my feet cannot glide smoothly and rapidly, from side-to-side, in Edilson Lima's style (and that of many Brazilian samba dancers). I can dance to this in a similar fashion, but in my own style.  I still end up enjoying myself dancing the samba and getting a good workout.  It is also in the Batacuda segment Lima introduces each of his lively backup dancers as they dance around in a samba circle.  And, ladies, the guys are so CUTE!

I love the Cool Down segment with the lovely Bossa Nova music being played by Geraldo de Oliveira and Paulinho Garcia (who does the vocals).  The music and singing/ad-libbing makes me daydream of a lazy day on some Brazilian beach (likely Ipanema). I love the song so much that I tape-recorded it for my own personal listening on my Walkman when I go for long walks.

I'm eagerly looking forward to trying the SamBody Advanced Workout dvd, which I also ordered.  As with the Basic Steps dvd, I'll learn each workout segment gradually, one at a time.  In time, I'll write my review on it, as well.

I often use the SamBody Basic Steps on the weekends following my Turbo Jam workout.  In fact, weekends are reserved for my Brazilian workouts.  I alternate SamBody with Vanessa Issac's ""Brazilian Samba Party"" and ""Brazilian Carnival Grooves"" dvds.  I'll soon be trying Elise Foss' ""Viva! Brazilian Rhythm Workout"" dvd, which includes another variation of the Samba, and two other Brazilian dances - Forro and Olodum.  I love the samba, and want to learn - and practice - other variations of the samba moves.

But for me, SamBody ranks #1 and is my favorite!  If you are a Brazil enthusiast, want a fun workout and to learn to dance Brazilian samba Rio Carnival-style, this is the dvd to get.",1153699200,3,3250,4.588541666666667
8047126,5,B0007G8W7U,"This review actually covers 5 of the 6 Samba videos I have purchased.

Samba Party Workouts 1 and 2 by Vanessa Isaac are fun workouts. As others have pointed out they are pretty basic. Since most people don't know much about Samba I assume this is done purposely to ease people into unfamiliar movements. If you don't have a strong dance background or want a slow, clear introduction to some basic samba movements, I would recommend these as a good starting point. She explains things very clearly and there is a section you can use to review individual movements slowly with additional explanation. If you know some samba, have alot of dance experience, or are looking for a challenge I recommend the SamBody Workout. I've been doing salsa/merengue/bachata off and on for about 12 years and I've been doing swing dancing for the past 7. I find that Sambody gives me a run for my money. It's a ton of fun but it will take me a few workouts to get the moves down. I like all of them but SamBody definitely challenges me quite a bit. It's super fun!! I also like the World Dance workout by Elsa Leandros. It has a Samba segment along with several other dances and will give you a couple extra moves to spice things up if you really want to pick up a variety of moves.

I did the Samba Party 1 dvd, using the instructional section first, and was able to do all the moves the first time without any problems. I did Samba Party 2 right afterwards, again using the instructional segment first, and was able to complete it with ease the first time. They were both fun and I could see myself doing these moves on a social dance floor. Later in the week I did Elsa's dvd which was a little more challenging since it covers several dancestyles. I did the instructional section first and found the workout to be fun and it gave me a good workout. It had some fun samba moves that were not covered in Vanessa's dvds. The next day I tried the SamBody workout -Basic Steps. It was fun but I couldn't quite get all the steps on the first go, even with some rewinding. It's faster pace with alot more movements performed overall. I think my brain got a little overloaded. I haven't tried my SamBody -Advanced Routines 1 yet but I did watch it and it looks fun. I can't wait to work my way up to it!",1149465600,4,2282,4.354460093896714
8047127,4,B0007G8W7U,"I had a blast doing this DVD. It isn't overly structured and I didn't feel like an idiot for not getting the steps perfect.  This is a dance video and thus there is no `abs, legs, arms' division.

Some things to think about before you buy it:

1. The instructor is very creative with the English language.

2. The routines are only done once at half tempo and once at full tempo then you move on.

3. The last section is not broken down as much as the previous four.

4. Some sections have head shots when you need to see footwork.

If you do buy it, then you'll be treated to the following sections:

1. A warm up that pays the obligatory homage to standard video practices.  It also gives you the break down of the samba step.  Take the time to rewind and really get this step down.  This is the basis of the rest of the video.

2. Four ""routines."" Each move has a name.  The dancers do it once slowly, then once at full tempo.  They are NOT put together at the end, but you will use some of the moves in the last section.  For some reason, the instructor is hoarse in the second routine.

3. An aerobics portion that consists of following the teacher's lead.  Only the samba step is repeated.

4. A cool down to bossa nova music.  The instructor gives instructions in a calmer voice while positive affirmations flash across the bottom of the screen.",1141862400,3,1352,4.2727272727272725
8047128,1,B0007G8W7U,"I made the mistake of believing two reviews previously posted that raved about how great this DVD is.  Now I wonder if they were real purchasers of the DVD, or just shills for the producers.  The dance steps are not adequately presented.  Before you have time to really master them, you are expected to do them double time, in a long, intricate series with other steps you also haven't mastered.  Then there's the language barrier.  The words chosen to describe steps are not good indicators of what that step does.  The instructor's accent, while charming, can be confusing.  It took me half the DVD to figure out ""Swill"" meant ""Swirl""!  Save your money!",1121212800,10,655,4.734513274336283
8047129,5,B0007G8W7U,"I found the Sambody video delightfully crafted to allow Latin dance lovers have a taste of Brazilian rhythms.  I had the opportunity to travel to Brazil and experience first hand the Rio's Carnival.  Sambody gives a nice introduction, step by step, so that you can experience samba dancing while getting a good cardio workout.  I definitely recommend it.",1118448000,2,354,5.068965517241379
8047130,5,B0007G8W7U,"I love it!. Highly recommended! The video is really contagious, and after you played a few times, You will get all the steps, and then You will play it over and over!. It really makes me sweat, but you don't realize it until it is over!. It works all your body and you'll have a lot of fun! BUY IT! IT IS GREAT!",1118102400,3,311,3.9523809523809526
8047131,5,B0007G8W7U,"This video is awesome! It's the only Brazilian workout video that shows authentic Samba like in Brazil, with real Brazilian music and dance. I'm Brazilian and I can affirm, ""Sambody is the real deal""!!!  I'm an aerobic and dance instructor and always watching workout videos to give me ideas for my classes. Sambody is one of the few videos that really helps me to teach samba steps in a simple way and supports creating new choreographs. The Carnaval Party in the end of the Advanced DVD is just marvelous! It worth to buy even just to watch and enjoy! Highly recommended!!!",1118016000,4,575,4.693069306930693
8047132,5,B0007G8W7U,"This video is amazing.  Sambody combines the authentic brazilian samba beat with instructional steps.  So easy to learn and fun to do everyday, Unlike the Zumba series which is confusing and boring.",1117152000,4,198,5.15625
8047133,1,B0007G8W7U,"This cheap immitation of Zumba is confusing and boring.

The music is terrible, unlike the Zumba videos that inlcude popular music HITS.

The brazilian instructor is annoying and after watching the video 5 times i did not learn any new steps.

Don't waste your money with this product.",1116547200,4,285,4.895833333333333
8047134,5,B0007G8W7U,"I highly recommend this workout DVD.  Edilson Lima breaks down all the steps and it's easy to follow, with great Brazilian beats to boot!  In the end I guarantee you will feel great and look great too.  Once you master the beginners, check out the advanced DVD-it's a must!",1112659200,4,273,4.530612244897959
