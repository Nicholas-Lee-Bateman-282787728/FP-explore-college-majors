8042806,3,B0006SSQTS,When I was 10 years old this was my favorite cartoon. I even had the action figures and I still have the Nintendo game (and it is horrible). When I saw this for sale I ordered it instantly. When it came in the mail I was a little disappointed. I only has 4 episodes on it. They could have put all 13 on it and it probably would have fit on 1 or 2 DVD's but I guess the producers of this low budget cartoon want to get you to buy all 4 DVD's separate.,1445385600,,450,3.7473684210526317

8042809,5,B0006SSQTS,"This is one of the greatest animated TV shows that I've seen, and the greatest show or movie that I have ever seen from Troma, most of their releases are horrible low-budget pieces of nothingness crap. The Toxic Crusaders is Troma's greatest achievement in my opinion and is one of the most underrated and short lived animated shows I can think of that I love, just like Monster Force. Toxic Crusaders reminds me of Captain Planet, if you like Captain Planet then you are sure to love this! I have seen the first 4 Toxic Avenger movie's as well as The Toxic Crusaders: The Movie and NONE of them are as great as this series is! I do wish this was the complete series but sadly it was way overpriced and impossible for me to get a hold of, but this will suffice. I remember when I was a kid and there was a coloring book for The Toxic Crusaders, it was my favorite coloring book even til this day, the characters, both the heroes and the villains are the most unique and cool looking characters you will see, and will most likely never see again. Dr. Killemoff is one of my favorite villains. I HIGHLY recommend The Toxic Crusaders, it is such a fun and awesome show, even now, it has held up all these years, and trust me, the odds were against this show for many reasons, but it prevailed!

The Toxic Crusaders: Volume One ***** out of *****

Violent Content: 3/10 - Action Violence and Mutations by Toxic Waste.

My Ratings for the movie's:

The Toxic Crusaders: The Movie *** out of *****
The Toxic Avenger (Unrated Version) **** out of *****
The Toxic Avenger II (Unrated Version) *  out of *****
The Toxic Avenger III (Unrated Version) * out of *****
The Toxic Avenger IV (Unrated Version) **** out of *****

(If you love the first and fourth Toxic Avenger movie like me, then check out Troma's Class of Nuke 'Em High I and II, Mother's Day, and Redneck Zombies are a few of Troma's best movie's in my opinion.",1394668800,,1915,4.395480225988701
8042810,5,B0006SSQTS,"I just received this DVD yesterday. The quality of this DVD is good. It was transfered well, both visually & the audio. Upon buying this, I didn't realize that this DVD is only a vol. 1 w/ 4 episodes. However, it does have some bonus material. Which also has bonus episodes. The cover art & disc art is great! Still worth the price regardless of only a vol. 1. There is a DVD complete set of the Toxic Crusaders aswell for like $27.00. I would like to eventually get that! The Toxic Crusaders cartoon is based off the campy Troma movie The Toxic Avenger. Some question why this was turned into a cartoon series in the 90's? But I personally think it's cool! They watered it down from the movie, to be alright for kids to see. It does have some over kids heads humor in the episodes. Which is fine & both kids and adults can enjoy it! The animation (and toyline) was done by the same companies that animated and manufactured the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the 80's-90's. If you were a kid of the 80's-90's you likely remember this & will enjoy it! My 10yr old son likes to watch it w/ me.",1360195200,,1092,4.280193236714976
8042811,5,B0006SSQTS,"While some believe that Troma was just trying to squeeze blood from a turnip.  I feel that The Toxic Crusaders Television Series was wonderful.  With the main star, a Hideous Creature of Superhuman size and strength, leading the way, this DVD does not disappoint.",1140652800,,263,4.954545454545454
