8232808,5,B000YH7EKI,"This is PERFECT for any toddler wanting to know more about Christmas and leave out all the Santa crap. I love Boz in general and so do my kids. It's great in that, it's very clear in it's message about God and His role in our lives but it's not so in your face that it's intrusive. The Christmas DVD is longer than the other Boz DVDs but doesn't disappoint. It's so nice to have a clear gospel message delivered in an easy to understand, fun way for my kids. I've also purchased several to give as gifts to family and friends over the years.",1447632000,4,541,4.161904761904762
