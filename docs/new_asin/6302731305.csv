7830192,5,6302731305,"The made-for-TV special, HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, WARNER BROS. (1991) is a superb two-hour (108 minutes, if you subtract commericials) retrospective that features ""more stars than there are in heaven"" (to borrow a phrase from MGM).

Besides the expected classic movie highlights, there's clips from the silent era studio, excerpts of rare star interviews, and screen tests of Lana Turner, Orson Welles, a soft-spoken Marlon Brando, Paul Newman with James Dean (East of Eden). There's also footage of an off-key Ruby Keeler.

Hosted by Clint Eastwood, with segments headed by Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn and Barbra Streisand.
