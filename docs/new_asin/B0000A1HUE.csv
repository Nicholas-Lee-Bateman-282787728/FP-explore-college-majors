7995316,5,B0000A1HUE,All fine and as promised.,1437523200,,25,4.2
7995317,1,B0000A1HUE,"Poorly done.  Have to keep the remote handy because you will constantly need it to bring up each lick and flip between all the menus.  There's more menus and fiddling with the remote than music.  Don Mock or Corey Christensen's DVDs are put together much more effectivly and you don't have to use the remote unless you want to, and also contain more music.",1363651200,,356,4.53125
7995318,3,B0000A1HUE,"Hello,

I think that this dvd is good but it could be better, you should be aware of all modes before getting into it and there's not a very good explanation of where does the exercises come from(like the mode used). I guess a 7 out of ten would be my grade for this item",1289001600,,271,3.9272727272727272
7995319,4,B0000A1HUE,This is a straight forward dvd that gets right to the point.  It is shown real time and slow motion with clear and concise finger movement.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn some awesome jazz licks in a relatively short amount of time.,1234137600,5,252,4.340425531914893
7995320,4,B0000A1HUE,I agree with previous reviewer Kris. I wish there was a way to repeat licks like you can with most media players. But alot of cool jazz licks.,1186012800,,142,4.107142857142857
7995321,5,B0000A1HUE,"This video features 50 jazz licks clearly demonstrated. The great thing about this DVD is that these are great sounding jazz licks without being over the top technique wise. Many jazz books and videos show licks that are just way to hard for the beginning to intermediate jazz player. Each lick is played slow and fast and the tab book matches the DVD extremely well. In response to the previous reviews about the format of DVD and it going back to the menu after each lick, I found after a while I like this format because once I got the lick under my fingers I could practice the lick and not have the DVD go far ahead and have to find my way back to where I was. Great DVD for learning a bunch of jazz licks.",1148256000,6,711,4.197080291970803
7995322,2,B0000A1HUE,"This dvd is not a bad dvd.  There are some issues with each lick playing through & then having to go back to the main menu to repeat it or go to the next lick.  The player on the dvd is very good, and I do like the way the earlier licks are shown slow & fast. What I don't like about the dvd is probably not a fault of the product, but a misperception on my part. I am a classic rock guitarist who has never played jazz before; I was expecting some entry level instruction along with the licks, which just is not there.",1141171200,2,519,3.8867924528301887
7995323,3,B0000A1HUE,"The first thing I noticed about this DVD is that you don't have a choice to play the whole thing through.  You get thrown back to the menu after each lick.  So you need 3 hands to play along.  One for the fretboard, one for the pick, and one for the DVD remote control.

The instuctional aspect of each lick is good for the first several licks.  Bruce plays each lick a few times at different speeds, and you get a nice breakdown of the fingering also.  Toward the the end of the lick register, he plays each lick at tempo, then kind of slow with no breakdown, then ofcourse, back the menu we go; and now I can't even grab the remote fast enough to get the next lick before, low and behold, I'm back at the menu.

Well, the licks are good anyway.  Should have been called 50 Licks Remote Style.  lmao",1111536000,,800,4.142857142857143
