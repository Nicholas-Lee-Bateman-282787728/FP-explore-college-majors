7860985,4,6304092105,"Columbia's Three Stooges compilations have been a mixed bag. However, this particular tape is excellent, with a trio of vintage shorts. ""Dizzy Doctors"" (1937) remains the best of the lot  a fast-paced romp featuring Moe, Larry and Curly as ""three of the best salesmen who ever saled."" The remaining two-reelers  ""Goofs and Saddles"" (1937) and ""Three Little Sew and Sews"" (1938)  are slapstick gems in the classic Stooge tradition. Good print quality throughout.",1111622400,3,461,5.287671232876712
7860986,5,6304092105,"DIZZY DOCTORS (1937) - Excellent short with the boys finding jobs as Brighto salesmen, but mistaking the medicine for polish.  The chase scene in the hospital is a highlight, and the ending is hilarious.
GOOFS AND SADDLES (1937) is one of the few Stooge westerns that I like.  In this one, the boys are calvalry men assigned to take on cattle rustlers and gangster Longhorn Pete.  A fast-paced short, with great scenes.
THREE LITTLE SEW AND SEWS (1939) is another great short, which casts the Stooges as tailors on a ship, and Curly pretends to be Admiral Taylor (and Moe and Larry his assistants) at a local party, and the boys end up being tricked into helping a gang steal a submarine.  The ending is hilarious.
I give this 4 1/2 stars.",994204800,3,739,4.575757575757576
