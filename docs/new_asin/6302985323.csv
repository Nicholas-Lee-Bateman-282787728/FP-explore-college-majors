531666,5,6302985323,"I AM A GREAT FAN OF JIM HUTTON.  I ENJOY HIS KIND OF COMEDY.  I FEEL THAT HE IS AN
EXCELLENT ACTOR. I WATCH EVERYTHING HE IS IN.",1353801600,2,128,3.5357142857142856
531667,5,6302985323,"This product arrived on time and in good condition, as promised.  I was very happy to enjoy this film once again and share it with my family.",1331424000,,141,4.222222222222222
531729,3,6302985323,"Not bad, a fairly good script but not as good as some of Hutton's other comedies",1436313600,,80,4.0625
531730,5,6302985323,"Great addition to my Fun WWII movie collection. Enjoyable, funny, great movie to take you away.",1435363200,,95,5.0
531731,4,6302985323,It's a four for me because it was light and frothy. I love the theme song. I truly enjoy '60's romance movies. It was a nice relaxing movie after a long day on my feet.,1434153600,,168,3.8285714285714287
531732,5,6302985323,great movie great service,1431561600,,25,5.5
531733,3,6302985323,An ok dvd comedy.,1427500800,,17,3.5
531734,3,6302985323,"Typical of its time.  Humorous, but kind of dumb seeming now - we've been conditioned to newer type of movies and story lines",1419811200,,125,4.434782608695652
531735,4,6302985323,"Not the best 60s rom-com out there, but still very enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of Jim or Paula.",1413504000,,105,4.3
531736,1,6302985323,"The DVD arrived in a flimsy cardboard ""folder"" that was crushed.  The plastic DVD case, the flimsiest I've ever seen, was broken in many places, with some pieces broken off.  I merely wanted them to know their cases were cheap and their shipping box inadequate, as I mistakenly thought they would care.  We DIDN'T ASK for a replacement;  we replaced the case ourselves.

They responded with, Please send it back to us so we can process a refund for you (we do not send replacements).

Their attitude of ""we do not send replacements,"" especially when I didn't ask for one, was completely arrogant, condescending, and apparently in violation of Amazon's rules.  Most people don't like to be told to ""go jump in the lake.""  The DVD appears to be fine, although I haven't watched it, yet.  It would cost more in postage to send the DVD back than the replacement case cost me.",1407542400,,871,4.640522875816994
531737,3,6302985323,"This is one you can watch once, then give it away.  I like Jim Hutton and Paula Prentiss, but this is not one of their better movies.  They are good, but the story is a little lame.  You'll have to decide for yourself on this one.",1405123200,,230,3.9565217391304346
531738,3,6302985323,This movie sounded better than it was.  It's my thinking that there was a lot of movies made like this during this time.  But the supporting actors do their best to make this movie enjoyable and if you overlook all the same plots.,1396483200,,230,4.325581395348837
531849,5,6302985323,"Jim Hutton and Paula Prentiss could do no wrong as comic actors!  I love movies from the 1960s with their silly, easy to laugh at plots and with the great actors of the day who could make you laugh without the need for the fart-humor of the current comedies.  A nice, gentle, easy on the eyes film well worth watching.",1396051200,,318,4.283333333333333
531850,5,6302985323,"Loved the movie years ago , would watch it when I seen it was going to be on T.V.  Hasn't been on for a long time so I ordered it!",1395273600,,130,3.3333333333333335
531851,4,6302985323,"A good movie, it has some laughs and some adventure and not any of the new junk that they call movies. Good family movie.",1393200000,,121,4.083333333333333
531852,4,6302985323,"I had just watched this in a retro theatre and loved it - do not let the ""war"" theme put you off - this is a comedy with 2 love stories wrapped up in an island in the south pacific during the last years of WW II. There are some elements that I would not take my 9 year old nephew to (do not think he would understand the comedy. This comedy is rated ""G"". Absolutely one for my ""must have"" collection.",1392681600,2,400,3.8902439024390243
531853,5,6302985323,Truly enjoyed this comedy Movie .... Paula Prentiss is from my home town ...... enjoy her in all her movies ....... tall & beautiful !!!,1384387200,,136,4.48
531854,5,6302985323,"This is a great movie with non stop laughs. Jim Hutton is so funny in this movie the poor thing can't stop getting hit in the head. I was happy to see Fuji from McHale's Navy, although he was being treated just as badly. I would recommend this movie to any fan of comedies.",1377302400,,273,4.074074074074074
531855,3,6302985323,"Not the best Hutton/Prentiss movie by far but okay.  I prefer ""Where The Boys Are"" by far.  This movie had parts that needed to be better developed I believe.",1375660800,,158,4.413793103448276
531856,5,6302985323,"By today's standards this is a very tame movie.  However, don't be fooled by it's age!  Wickedly funny! I highly recommend to any fan of Jim Hutton or Paula Prentiss, you won't be disappointed.",1374278400,,193,4.647058823529412
531857,4,6302985323,"Horizontal Lieutenant-like the move, did not notice problems with remastering. Extra word s needed to be able to submit this",1360627200,,124,5.25
531858,4,6302985323,"A good light hearted comedy about the military.  Will keep a smile on your face with an occasional chuckle.  Not as many laugh out loud moments as the best comedies, but better than average.",1359936000,,190,4.5588235294117645
7833766,4,6302985323,"It was a lot of fun. Not as good as In the Teahouse of the August Moon, but not bad.",1497657600,,84,3.25
7833767,4,6302985323,OK movie. I am a Jim Hutton Paula Prentiss fan. Those 2 acted well together.,1475712000,,76,4.133333333333334
7833768,5,6302985323,"Love the movie; can watch many times; they just don't make

7833773,3,6302985323,"Remembered this movie being funnier then rather than now.  Little disappointed, but love Paula Prentiss.  Okay movie but nothing to get overly thrilled about.  Check out Man's Favorite Sport for best Paula Prentiss movie ever.",1439251200,,226,5.4
