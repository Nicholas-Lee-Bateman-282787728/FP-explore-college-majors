These war-time movies are interesting for their outlook. Will there ever be a war to end war? No, human nature can never be at peace as long as some try to exploit others. But at least we can try.  See the individual reviews for more details.

A Walk in the Sun, 1945
This was adapted from Harry Browns book of the same name. It tells about a day in an infantry mans life on a military operation. A walk in the sun was a phrase for an easy operation. These soldiers are sent to destroy a bridge behind the lines. They also destroy a machine gun nest in a farmhouse. Harry Brown became a screen writer and later worked on The Sands of Iwo Jima.

Gung Ho, 1943
This is the story of the Second Marine Raider Battalion in the South Pacific. Lt. Col. Evans F. Carlson joined the Chinese Eighth Route Army before WW II to learn about their successes. Gung Ho is the Chinese phrase for teamwork. Marines are trained to fight and win. Submarines transport 600 men to Makin Island. They go ashore, fight the enemy and destroy the radio station. They withdraw before a Japanese naval task force arrives. Will freedom be ensured after the war ends?

Go For Broke, 1951
This is a story about the 442nd Combat team, one of the most decorated units in WW II. It was composed of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Their families had been forcibly evacuated from their homes and lands. [Like the native Americans in the 18th and 19th centuries.] Go for Brokeis pidgin English for shoot the works. They are sent to Italy in May 1944 and attack the enemy. Next they are sent to France for more combat. They receive their deserved awards at the end for a happy ending.",1397001600,,1690,4.3354430379746836

8379102,5,B002S5PSBQ,"World War II was about to end when this gem of a film was made.  ""A Walk In The Sun"" is a walk through a small bit of history involving the lives and losses of U.S. soldiers, two ""captured"" Italian infantrymen whose payment for suggesting nothing not already known by the Army platoon making its way to a bridge and farmhouse a few miles from their point of arrival on a beachhead in Anzio, was to be treated in a friendly manner, given a cigarette or two and sent off with the platoon's blessings.

The remarkable film stars Dana Andrews, Lloyd Bridges, Richard Conte, and many other familiar faces and careers from the past.  It begins on the beach head and the character portrayed by famed voice actor Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh) wants to get a view of the surroundings, borrowing the field glasses of a platoon sergeant.  Knowing he was stuck in the open the private still has to have the picture of war in his mind as the ships and planes in the background filled the air with bombs and shells.  True to the character he remains, unfortunately, on the beach along with the not lost field glasses while the rest of his platoon move onto their assignment, blowing up a bridge while taking an accompanying farmhouse where the Germans defended the area with machine guns.

The ""walk"" is a long and often interrupted series of conversations between those engaged, and equally quite aware of their situation as they make their way toward their target.  The dialogue makes this film, it has a feel of a World War Two quality that you can feel like a used suit on sale at a discount house.  The suit, however, fits every member of the  audience, and for those who walked this path before, during or after the Second World War it was fresh but familiar material.

The characters and actors seem to have been born to play these parts.  Dana Andrews at his finest (later followed up in an Academy Award Winning film, ""The Best Years of our Lives"") presents a platoon sergeant capable of taking charge as needed, aware, as all the men were, that this short march toward an aggressive enemy could be their last and by issuing orders to his own troops the likelihood of death on both sides of this small patch of ground was assured.

Richard Conte creates a likeable character as Private Rivera, a machine-gunner proclaiming his rightful position as ""a killer,"" perhaps joking to those he addresses while knowing this was the net result of his responsibility to the platoon and to the end of this despised war.  John Ireland portrays a young man who writes and then recalls letters put into memory finally putting pencil to paper and providing the reader (most especially the audience) what he takes away from each living moment, particularly his own walk in the sun.  One surviving member of the cast, actor Norman Lloyd portrays the character Private Archimbeau whose bitterness towards warfare uses a theme that threads its way throughout the movie.  ""The next real war will be in Tibet,"" an interesting perspective that the next big war would be fought in a country without an army or a reason to overtake.  Free Tibet is now a call and a billboard for freedom heard and read around the world.  The background music is uniquely American, a profound ""negro spiritual"" lending much to the film, ""That Old Lincoln Highway Back Home.""  Every inch of this film is held together by its own pace and it is well worth seeing more than once.

This is a remarkable film, it is simple yet cerebral, a footnote to history and portrayed by a cast whose efforts and own relationship to this era tells a very honest and worthwhile story.",1384732800,,3625,4.6359375
8379103,1,B002S5PSBQ,"This DVD is three movies: Hitler's SS: portrait of evil, black brigade, and minesweeper. I thought this would be more of a documentary but it isn't.  It is a collection of three very bad, forgotten WWII movies. It is not worth buying even for die hard WWII collectors. It looks like something you picked up at a dollar store.",1218585600,,325,4.508474576271187
