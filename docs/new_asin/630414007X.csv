7863943,5,630414007X,"A nostalgic and intimate recollection of a brief period of time in the lives of residents of a Roman apartment building. Beautifully filmed, well acted and tightly directed, the many vignettes of the events in the lives of several neighbors offer a captivating and touching look into both the Italian psyche and the Italian sociology. Humorous, poignant, and well-edited. All events revolve around a solar eclipse in the summertime. This is a film which can be watched many times and you will always find new nuances and twists because it is so loaded with interesting material. Well worth the investment.",1044662400,8,605,5.06
