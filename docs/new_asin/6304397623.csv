8557697,4,6304397623,"The movie ""Who Done It?"" is classic slapstick. Notable was that this film was also the first starring role for Benny Hill, the lovable British comic who was best remembered for his show's burlesque-style humor than for his film work.

In the film, Hill played Hugo Dill, a lovable, bumbler who becomes a private detective, who ends up investigating the murder of a foreign diplomat who bears a resemblance to him, much to the chagrin of the Scotland Yard inspector who seems to lose patience with Dill's constant bumbling.

The DVD is especially noteworthy because it also contains a rarely seen 30-minute theatrical short titled ""The Waiters"", which was produced by Paramount in 1971.  The piece contained no dialogue, paying homage to the silent film era.",1124064000,,757,4.992063492063492
8557698,4,6304397623,"If you only like comedy films that are subtle and sophisticated, ""Who Done It ? "" is not for you. Personally, I found this movie to be consistently amusing, and I laughed out loud a number of times.
Benny Hill was one of Britain's most inventive comics, who achieved international stardom in the 70s and 80s through his zany television shows. In fact, television was Benny's medium--he did not make many movies.
""Who Done It ?""--released in 1956--features a young Benny in his first major starring role, and he makes the most of it. After losing his job at the Ice Capades, Benny decides to become a private detective, with the help of a surprisingly energetic bloodhound. He becomes involved with a pretty girl
( young and gorgeous Belinda Lee ), and a group of up-to-no-good Iron Curtain-type spies, led by stalwart British character actor, David Kossoff. Benny gets into one scrape after another, much to the continual annoyance of the police. There are various opportunities for Benny to ""disguise"" himself--a Hill trademark. Several setpieces stand out--posing as a ""mad professor"", Benny demonstrates a machine that ""controls"" the weather, with disastrous results--Benny and Belinda chasing the spies around a broadcasting convention at Earl's Court ( the whole film takes place in London )--the climactic race around a stock car track, reminiscent of the silent Keystone Cops movies.
Basil Dearden directs at a breakneck pace, and--yes--the plot is outlandish--the acting over the top--but if you like Benny and his antics, as I do, you'll love it.
Benny passed away suddenly about 12 years ago, and Britain lost one of it's brightest talents. In the biography included with this disc, it notes that a dying Charlie Chaplin spent many of his last days watching Benny's shows. Apparently, Milton Berle was a huge fan. If Chaplin and Berle thought Benny was funny, does it really matter what the rest of us think ? No comic could have more respected fans than these two ""giants"".
Another ""bonus"" with the DVD is a 30-minute, silent film Benny made in 1969, called ""The Waiters""--Benny and a dim-witted sidekick are hired to cater a small party at an elegant country home. Would you want Benny to serve you food and drinks at a party ? If one of your guests is a curvaceous woman in a low-cut dress, would you want Benny within half a mile of her ?
Rhetorical questions both ! For you the viewer, this is a very entertaining half hour.
The picture quality for ""Who Done It ?"" is excellent--mono sound, of course. If you like goofy comedies--and Benny Hill in particular--Anchor Bay has given us another winner. Well done !",1075766400,17,2626,4.863839285714286
8557699,5,6304397623,"Although I have watched the video 4 - 5 times, the most recent viewing was over a year ago. This is significant because it proves the memorably of the film. The film is well done. I must say there is no ""obligatory endless complaining about rampant Socialism"" so common to comedies of its era/place.
It has a fun chase at the end. There is a disastrous awards dinner. There are disguises too. It's a fun film. A note of caution: THERE ARE NO ""BABES IN BIKINIS."" It is a film with an actual plot !  Benny does exhibit many of his famous mannerisms, it's fun to look for them. I heartily recommend the film to fans of B&W Brit Comedies, and the ""intellectual"" Hill fan.  :-D",1017705600,9,672,4.325396825396825
