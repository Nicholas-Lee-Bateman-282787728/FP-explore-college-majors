8416912,4,B0045ZAQRI,"I liked this film a lot.  Not a lot happens but it is so smartly presented that it is a delight to watch.  The plot revolves mainly around the making of a documentary film on extraordinary women, focusing on a Parisian feminist author.  She has returned to her childhood home in the provinces to settle the estate of her late mother and also to run for office from that district.  We see her, her boy-friend, her sister and brother-in-law, and the Algerian woman who raised them and her son, who is now grown and one of the film makers.  The other film maker is the teacher of the young Algerian who is, incidently, in love with the feminist's sister.  The characters' lives intertwine in funny and sometimes surprising ways.  It's complicated and silly and messy...like life.  Sometime's it's very funny and sometimes not-so-much....but always engaging.

The characters are shown with all their weaknesses as well as strengths, which endears them to us.  Some of the characters fare better than others, some seem to learn and grow and others don't.  Again, it's like life and it's presented in a gentle, generous spirited way that leaves you smiling.",1354924800,5,1151,4.821428571428571

I also enjoyed being a ""voyeuse"" into the dysfunctional family dynamics. Interesting how the different family dynamics played out and how interdependent they were.",1353628800,2,273,5.2272727272727275
