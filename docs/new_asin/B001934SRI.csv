8271719,3,B001934SRI,"The set up was cool having the movie take place on Halloween. The main actors were decent, they did what they needed to do. My main issue is the villian was not really scary, and there were times when the pace was a little slow. They did not go with cheesy CHGI so that was good as most was practical effects. The movie was decent as far as sound goes, but some of the movie was a little gritty making it hard at times to see what was going on. Over all it is not a bad movie to watch with a few beers on a rainy night.",1429488000,,519,3.814814814814815

In DEATH ON DEMAND, a mountain climber goes crazy and massacres his entire family, then hangs himself. This prologue is nicely rendered in eerie, pastel greenish-yellow hues. It's the only scene in the film that's nicely shot.

Fast-forward 20 years. A sleazy producer creates a Halloween night webcast about three young couples who go on a scavenger hunt in the dead mass murderer's decrepit house. Of course, the mass murderer's ghost returns and the body count mounts. (Yes, the story is lifted from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Resurrection/dp/B004P7CNWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween: Resurrection</a>.)

This film has some REALLY bad acting. Mostly mugging for the camera, and fake Jerry Springer type catfights, and guys oogling at nekkid girls' breasts.

Yes, there is a fair amount of soft-core porn in this film. One couple is lesbian, sort of. One of the pair is a flaky, bimbo type lesbian (the sort you might see in male porn featuring ""lesbians""). Her partner ""lesbian"" is not a lesbian at all, but a porn star that the sleazy producer hired to pretend to be a lesbian and try and sleep with as many of the contestants as she can.

The gore is EXTREMELY graphic. Some extended shots of the killer extracting muscle tissue, and pulling out organ after organ, from his screaming victims. There's also some ""comic relief"" when one guy uses a Viagra type pill to obtain a HUGE *r*ction -- only to have the killer tear off his looooong p*n*s.

This is a really stupid film. I guess the filmmaker set it on Halloween night for the atmosphere, but there isn't much. You can't even tell it's supposed to be on Halloween night, apart from a string of Jack O'Lantern lights in the video control room, and that some horny viewers at home are in costume.

If you don't require good acting, characterization, logic, or atmosphere, just plenty of graphic violence and nudie shots, then this is the film for you.",1382918400,,2262,5.427350427350428

Before helming the terminally stupid <em>Death on Demand</em>, Adam Matalon had directed two things: Sesame Street skits and a short called <em>Sex and Camping</em>. No, I can't figure it out, either. But it makes a lot more sense than <em>Death on Demand</em>, whose continuity issues in the first half-hour would really be a problem if you could somehow bring yourself to give half a fig about the goings-on therein.

Plot: Sean McIntyre (<em>Sixty Cups of Coffee</em>'s Jerry Broome) was a mountaineer who went nuts and killed his family twenty years ago. Ever since, his house has stood abandoned, rumored to be haunted. Fast-forward to the present day, and college student Richard DeNola (<em>Over the G.W.</em>'s Dan Falcone), looking for a way to make some quick cash, comes up with the idea of doing a webcast from the house, offering five grand to anyone who manages to stay the night without fleeing. His dad (Ralph Bernard in his first feature appearance), a self-made millionaire, thinks he's nuts, but you know fathers--as long as Richard can get a thousand subscriptions to the webcast, he clears the prize money and makes a nifty profit. In order to massage the numbers, Richard comes up with three teams guaranteed to pull in the local viewers. There are two rival football stars from the team, Biff (<em>All God's Creatures</em>' Josh Folan) and Brad (<em>What Happens in Vegas</em>' Brandon Goins) and their girlfriends, aspiring psychic Darla (<em>The Flying Scissors</em>' Elizabeth Jamison) and Tammy (<em>Apocalypse, CA</em>'s Anne McDaniels). The fifth respondent is something of a geek, and subscriptions are flagging, so Richard makes the decision to dump his partner and substitute Velvet Luv (<em>Emerging Past</em>'s Krista Grotte), a porn star he's hired. Subscriptions go through the roof--and really explode when a s&eacute;ance held by Darla, engineered by Richard, inadvertently causes the group to bring the spirit of Sean McIntyre back into our world to kill again.

I'm pretty sure ""dumb"" is not the right word to use for this. (I have read a number of reviews that say it's a direct rip-off of <em>Halloween: Resurrection</em>; I haven't seen that one and so can't say, but I'll put it out there just in case.) It has all the hallmarks of exactly the kind of movie you want to avoid: the plot is lame and predictable, the acting is worthless, the direction is fumble-fingered. And if you can make sense out of the opening sequence before halfway through the movie, you did better than I. If you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off horror movie and your video rental store is out of every other possible choice, grab this. Otherwise, go with something, anything, else. * ",1329264000,,2763,5.133333333333334
8271722,4,B001934SRI,"The movie opens with the McIntyre murders, a black and white scene of a guy killing his family, then himself. 20 years later the house becomes a scene for a reality show where contestants must spend the night in the house equipped with sound (screams) and cameras. The characters entertain us with some ""good"" cheesy dialouge. The contest takes place on Halloween night with live streaming. In order to get viewers, they add a porn star to the group. The group includes two rival football players and their girlfriends along with a lesbian who is paired up with the porn star.

The couples initially hold a seance lead by Daphne Ciccarelle who dabbles in the occult...now it is a matter of who lives and dies and whatever plot twists they can come up with.

I liked the overall ""B"" movie quality to this film. While it isn't anything new to the horror film genre, I enjoy rip off movies that are done well with characters and dialouge.

8271723,2,B001934SRI,I have no problem with a little sex and nudity in a horror film but this film was more like a soft core porno horror film. Not my thing. I liked the gore and blood but not the other junk.,1317340800,,187,3.7
8271724,2,B001934SRI,"Arrange a competition around surviving the night in a haunted house, and I will watch it.  I guess that means I'm part of the reason why bad low budget movies like Death on Demand keep getting made.  All is not a total loss here, though - sure, the acting is atrocious and the script is juvenile, but there's a decent amount of gore involved.

For any insane killer, there's always someone more than willing to exploit that person's crimes for material gain.  Twenty years ago, ice climber Sean McIntyre returned home (after losing it on a climb and killing his Sherpa guide because he thought he was a Yeti) to his loving family, only to slaughter all of them and then hang himself.  Now, a young entrepreneur has put together a Halloween night webcast in the house, giving one of three local college couples a chance at winning five grand - if they can solve all of the clues scattered around the place and find their way out.  Eager to prove himself to his doubting father, he's somehow managed to replace one of the original contestants with adult film star Velvet Luv in order to sell more online subscriptions.  Velvet is partnered up with an emo lesbian (whose voice is even more annoying than Fran Drescher's), while the other couples consist of two antagonistic football jocks (Biff and Brad) and their girlfriends.  Brad and Biff epitomize all of the worst stereotypes you've ever heard about football players - and they dislike each other intensely.  After a sance to call up the spirit of Sean McIntyre, the contest finally begins.  It's fun to watch the reaction of the contestants' buddies back at the dorm, but the action inside the house is just stupid and boring.  Of course, we all know what's going to happen to these annoying characters.

Apart from the gore, it doesn't look as if anyone made any effort whatsoever to make this a movie worth watching.  This is truly a film that only a bad movie lover can possibly enjoy.  Those without a weird sense of humor and a weakness for really stupid movies may find themselves fantasizing about the death of director Adam Matalon and everyone else involved in this embarrassingly bad film.",1310688000,,2153,4.691489361702128
