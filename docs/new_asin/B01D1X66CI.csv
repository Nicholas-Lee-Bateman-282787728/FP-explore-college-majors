8754676,4,B01D1X66CI,"""Jungle Menace,"" released in 1937 was Columbia's ""first serial,"" though they were involved with distribution of ""The Lost City"" two years earlier.  Their early serials were outsourced, this one to Weiss, who made it under the ""Adventure Pictures"" banner.  It was the only serial directed by George Melford, his last directing credit, though co-director Harry Fraser had previously worked on Mascot's ""The Wolf Dog.""  While there are similarities to earlier Weiss serials, like ""The Clutching Hand,"" and the production teams include many of the same people, ""Jungle Menace"" has virtues and problems of its own.

The plot involves a gang of rubber thieves in the jungles of Asia, trying to take over the plantation of Chandler Elliott (John St. Polis), whose plight is investigated by his friend, Frank Hardy (Frank Buck), an animal trapper.  While the identity of the head of the rubber thieves, Robert Banning (Richard Tucker) is revealed to the audience early in the first chapter, he keeps this a secret from his gang members, who get their instructions through nightclub manager Armand Roget (Duncan Renaldo).

While there is enough murder, mayhem and jungle beasts for fifteen chapters, or ""Acts"" as they are called, what is strikingly different from other serials is that it plays more like a feature film with arbitrarily placed breaks.  There is a lack of the normal serial-movie ""action"" and only a few actual ""cliffhangers"" which usually get resolved through the spoken introduction to the next chapter, rather than being shown as part of the film.  It doesn't seem to be an improvement.  There are other problems, mostly that top-billed Frank Buck, nominally the ""hero,"" never seems especially concerned with the problems of the rubber plantation, and as an actor he was a good animal trapper.  Sasha Siemel, ""The Tiger Man"" was also a celebrity rather than an actor, though his role is considerably smaller, and the ""romantic couple,"" Charlotte Henry and William Bakewell, as Elliott's daughter Dorothy and Banning's nephew Tom, aren't given a lot to do.  The best presence among the ""good guys"" is Robert Warwick as Chief Inspector MacLeod, though he is mostly confined to his office.  Of far greater interest are the bad guys, with most of the action involving Elliott's plantation manager Jim Murphy (LeRoy Mason), aided by John Davidson as Dr. Coleman and ""The Professor,"" played with delightful dark humor by George Rosener, who was also involved in the writing.  In other roles, Clarence Muse appears as a singer, avoiding the worst of the ""ethnic"" stereotypes of the era, and his fine voice makes the musical numbers quite tolerable.  But a warning is needed
about the ""comic relief"" from housekeeper Mrs. Maitland (Gertrude Sutton) and houseboy Chiang (Willie Fung), which with a few exceptions, the relief is when it's over.  Lee Zahler did a good job with the music, matching the atmosphere of the story, if it isn't of the ""pulse-pounding"" variety that was still being developed at Republic in 1937.

Grapevine's editon is on three single-layer DVD-R discs.  Their print is headed ""Favorite Pictures Presents,"" as the serial was reissued in the 1950s, with the only mention of Columbia being in the copyright notice.  The ""next week"" titles appear to have been redone for that reissue, referring to ""chapters"" instead of ""acts"" but the rest of the film is likely how it was originally seen.  Picture and sound suggest a reduction print, the image somewhat unsharp and a little murky, the sound weak in high frequencies, but both are clear enough to tell what's going on.

While no substitute for one of Republic's well-made high-energy productions, ""Jungle Menace"" does show what Weiss could do with a slightly higher budget than they had for their previous efforts, and what Columbia was doing to get into serials, so it is good to have it available on DVD.  Watched with a day or more between chapters the story moves along fairly well, especially when the bad guys are up to their no-good deeds.  Grapevine's DVD is decent enough, and their price is reasonable.",1471392000,,4086,5.040118870728083
