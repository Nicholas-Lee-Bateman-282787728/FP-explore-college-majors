1894408,4,B00009WNVC,"Being new to the world of kayaking I found this DVD to be an informative and quick place to begin.  Concise and to the point, it walked me through the basics and delivered on what it promised.  For those just getting into kayaking it's a bargin, especially when compared to how much a private lesson costs at my local outdoor center.  If you're looking for super advanced kayaking techniques, or tips on kayak camping you're best to look elsewhere, but if you're looking to get started in this captivating sport, its as good of a resource as I've come across so far.",1111708800,9,566,4.529411764705882
1894409,1,B00009WNVC,"I cannot understand how this video can be rated higher than one star.  It has almost no information at all.  It is so basic, that it cannot even be considered as instructional.  And the editing?  Horrible!  If you like watching a DVD where the people's heads are cut off continually throughout the DVD, you will enjoy this.  I have found more useful short videos available to view from internet sites and they contain way more information.  The price is ridiculous for what is contained in this video.  It should be more like $4.99.  I am so sorry that I spent the money on this DVD.  Do not consider it an instructional DVD...especially if you already know what a kayak or a paddle look like.  I'm not kidding.  After watching it, you'll ask yourself, ""That's it?!""  I threw out this DVD after watching it once.",1111363200,8,812,4.555555555555555
1894410,5,B00009WNVC,"I purchased this DVD after purchasing my first Kayak. I was looking for more instruction for Sit on Tops since that is what I have but still found it helpful. It covers the basics and is enjoyable. Being new to Kayaking and not having any instructional schools nearby it gave me much needed basic information. I also found their website informative. Next time I am in San Diego I may stop into their store. I recommend it for any beginner. Also for someone like me who has a sit on top, it made me consider maybe trying out the sit in type.

1894411,5,B00009WNVC,"I bought this DVD BEFORE I bought my kayak. After watching it, I was able to make an informed decision on the type of kayaking I wanted to do and the type of kayak I needed to meet my needs. In addition, it explains proper paddle and safety techniques. Once I bought the kayak and went paddling a few times, I found it helpful to watch the video again to review my paddle technique. I highly recommend you watch this video before you purchase a kayak if you are unsure of the type of kayak you want. Very informative!",1066003200,18,517,4.232323232323233
1894412,5,B00009WNVC,"I was just able to watch this DVD and was very impressed. Firstly, I wanted to comment on the production which is really a step forward in this genre of film. The editing is slick and clean. The audio is concice and well mastered.
But what's important here is what the film covers. From a complete beginner, to someone with limited experience looking to improve the paddling experience, increase safety and basically have more fun, this video touches on all the little bits of information that are necessary, but that could take a lifetime to learn on ones own. If you're even just a weekend worrior, and paddle 2 or three times a year, this video is well worth watching for its wealth of information.",1062028800,11,701,4.616
1894413,5,B00009WNVC,"If you want to get into kayaking and experience the outdoors, I recommend this video.
Key sections covered in this Video include a brief but thought provoking discussion of kayak design characteristics and how they affect its performance, safety and personal equipment, launching in a variety of situations, paddle strokes, bracing to prevent capsizing, and exiting and re-entry into your boat if it does happen.
 I wish I had this video before I got my first touring boat last season, since I am now considering a much different style and size for my needs. If you are just getting into kayaking, I suggest you consider this video even before you get your first boat. The discussion on kayaks will definitely help you decide what kind of boat you would like to paddle, and make the smartest purchase decision for your needs.
The material covered is so general, if you are planning on getting into creek running, touring or even weekend cottage fishing, this video will definitely send you onto the water with ideas about the skills you need to develop to make your paddling experience more fun, and more safe!
The only missing information from this video is thorough coverage of roll techniques. I expect this is deliberate though, as you should learn this from a certified or experienced instructor. (Immediately when you get your boat.)
Happy paddling!",1055376000,14,1355,4.942982456140351
7993706,3,B00009WNVC,"This video spent a lot of time on the pro's and con's of different styles and sizes of kayaks, which is certainly helpful for beginners shopping for kayaks. It also went into detail on paddling techniques -- helpful information, too. I was disappointed, however, in the way it just touched on how to re-enter the kayak using a paddle float and didn't really demonstrate the technique or the use of a rescue sling. There was not much about how to negotiate surf or wakes, either. It felt like the editors spent all their time on the first part of the video, then ran out of time to cover the rest. I would say this is a decent resource for very beginner kayakers, but not for intermediates.",1211500800,,689,4.476190476190476
7993707,4,B00009WNVC,I thought the dvd was very informative and greatly respect even though it was very through they recommended having hands on professional instruction before one actually go kayaking.,1200700800,,181,5.5
7993708,5,B00009WNVC,"Not knowing anything about kayaking and being the recipient of 2 kayaks for ""Christmas in June"" by my mother-in-law, my wife and I had to get some fundamentals on how to use these things.  This DVD was excellent in explaining essential fundamentals and things ""we need to know"" before putting our kayaks in the water.  We have watched the DVD a couple of times and will watch it a number of times again until all the information sinks in.",1185062400,,438,4.531645569620253
7993709,4,B00009WNVC,Very informative for the beginner like myself. It shows you in great detail what you should be doing and how you should do it.  I will play this over and over as a review every time I go paddling. This video is supper for any beginner.,1184198400,,235,4.108695652173913
7993710,5,B00009WNVC,It basically told you what you need to know to get started--- entering and exiting. etc. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. I would like to have more on basically (what kind of kayak you should get based upon your requirements sea.. recreational.. whitewater etc.) - good and bad parts about all of them plus probably a little bit more on getting out of them... all and all though a must for the first time kayaker though and I'm glad i bought it.,1180396800,,462,4.383720930232558
7993711,3,B00009WNVC,"Great video if you are kinda afraid of your first kayak experience but you wanna do it. The video is amatorial, but explains everything you need to know. Some areas are not covered like currents and waves which are really important for the beginner.",1168387200,2,249,4.681818181818182
7993712,5,B00009WNVC,"This DVD is excellent!!!  Even though I had a beginner's lesson on a pond, this video provided me with a lot of valuable information, plus being able to see how different strokes and steering the kayak was done.  I really recommend this video for all kayakers!  I have told my paddling friends about it.

7993713,3,B00009WNVC,"I am completely new to kayaking. The information that was presented was excellent - proper equipment, how to put the kayak into the water, how to get into the kayak from dock or shore, different paddle strokes, defensive maneuvers to avoid capsizing, and how to recover from capsizing. However, there was nothing on how to paddle a tandem kayak, how to deal with wakes from passing power boats or how to deal with waves in open water.  Those three areas are of most concern to me and were not covered at all in the DVD. That is why I gave it a rating of 3 ***.  Much of what was presented is intuitive.  I may have spent the money on the DVD anyway, but I wish that I would have had a review like this one to read before I bought it.",1166659200,5,733,4.147887323943662
7993714,4,B00009WNVC,"If you are just getting into kayaking and don't have someone to teach you the basics, this is a great beginner video.  I would highly recommend you watch it before going out for the first time.  It will save you a lot of wasted energy and effort . . . as well as give you a start on good technique so you don't learn bad habits.",1161043200,2,328,3.9545454545454546
7993715,4,B00009WNVC,A nice DVD to get started.  It was a pleasant change to see the techniques in motion instead of just seeing still pictures like in many of the books and magazines I've purchased.  I learnt a few paddling techniques that alone were worth the price of the video.,1115251200,8,260,4.395833333333333
