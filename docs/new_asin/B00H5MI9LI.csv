6132964,5,B00H5MI9LI,"What a great 4-pack movie, 4 movies for a price of one! 2 American tail gems and a great 3rd mouse movie. The 4th movie gives you an idea roughly what the Walt Disney classic of Uncle Remus stories is all about. The Disney movie has not been released in DVD format in America just yet. If it does, the price will be exorbitant! Sigh!",1406592000,2,333,4.138461538461539
