It isn't the story of these films, although they are excellent, it is the atmosphere these films create while watching them.",1358467200,18,258,4.285714285714286
5082657,3,B007FQXEQO,Don't stack DVDs one on top of another.  This can result in damage to individual DVDs.  The Jean Harlow packaging is the best.,1356566400,2,126,4.434782608695652

5082661,4,B007FQXEQO,"I don't write many reviews, but felt I had to pitch in my two cents' worth after reading the meager reviews posted so far.  Overall, I was pretty impressed by these four movies--and I've had my fair share of bad movie purchases based on reviews posted here.

My favorite is ""Action in the North Atlantic,"" with the Allied supply ships being ""hunted"" by the U-boat wolf packs.  Even though some of the ""ships on the sea"" scenes were obviously models in a tub of water, they did not detract from the overall quality of the storyline and there were some outstanding real-life segments edited in which helped with the realism of the film which, incidently, was used for training Merchant Marines.  Bogart was very good in his first officer role of Joe Rossi and Raymond Massey, Alan Hale and Dane Clark provided good support.  There was a good amount of action and a satisfying conclusion pulled together quickly in the last 5 minutes.

""Across the Pacific"" was also pretty good.  It actually surprised me.  The bantering between Bogart and Mary Astor was entertaining and Sydney Greenstreet played an obvious Japanese sympathizer, but you didn't quite know how sympathetic he was until the movie progressed.

""Passage to Marseille"" really surprised me in being a good, solid adventure story about the cost of patriotism.  Peter Lorre was very good in a departure from the smarmy little man he played in The Maltese Falcon.  Besides Claude Rains, I wasn't familiar with the other actors' names but a few of them looked very familiar.  The story is told in flashback form and the ending is a tribute to the bravery and dedication of true patriots.  I don't think this was based on a true story, but it easily could have been.

I thought ""They Drive by Night"" was the weakest of the four but certainly not a bad film,  It just seemed more ""dated"" than the others.  It throws a couple of curves in the storyline and goes from a trucker story to a kind of suspense drama.  Ida Lupino is very good as the unhappy wife (who eventually goes off the deep end in a great courtroom scene) of hapless Alan Hale.  She has an eye for George Raft but he only has eyes for stunning Ann Sheridan who's great as the wise-cracking waitress.

Now, onto the packaging.  I can't quite figure out what people are whining about.  The ""stackable"" case is adequate with plenty of room for all 4 DVDs.  True, there is the chance for scratching if you're not super careful when handling the discs, but I solved that with the purchase of a Quad Disc DVD Case (5 pack) from CyberGuys for only $3.79.  Problem solved--and I have extra cases should I buy more 4-DVD collections.",1348012800,85,2643,4.624463519313305
5082662,4,B007FQXEQO,The TCM Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Humphrey Bogart includes four Bogart lesser known classics. They Drive by Night has less of a role for Bogart and much more for Ida Lupino and is generally rated as the best of the four films. The other three are solid Bogart WWII films. The transfer quality is good and the collection is very much worth having.,1347753600,18,362,4.671875
5082663,4,B007FQXEQO,"These four films showcase Humphrey Bogart in the above average but not greatest films he made. My favorite movie ofthese is Action in the North Atlantic.  Bogurt gets to play the all-wise first mate on a World War II merchant ship attacked by U-boats and the Luftwaffe.  He, of course, saves the ship.  The other three films in this dvd are also entertaining.",1343606400,6,359,4.666666666666667
5082664,1,B007FQXEQO,"They drive by night was one of the first noirs I watched as a child, naturually making it a must have. I owned it before in a slim case but it was lost and also part of a box set that I already own the feature titles. I don't know why but warner has been selling their 4 sets with the dvds stacked together. I HATE this deception but to recieve it from TCM? Buyer beware, if you like your disc stacked...fine! Myself, well I think it is cheap and deceptive. I purchased many Universal 4 packs and the disc are in individual holders. I give this 1 star simply for the dvd quality of the movies, but 0 for the packaging! These disc end up in cd cases were IM not able to display them. Not to mention stacked disc get scratched easily.....Shame on you TCM/WARNER!",1341446400,20,760,4.1768707482993195

5082795,5,B007FQXEQO,"Humphrey Bogart is an American icon.
He's been featured on everything from t-shirts to posters despite the fact he was short, not really what you'd call handsome, and spoke with a slight lisp.
He's been the subject of biographies and imitated by many.
That said, he was a very fine actor and this collection gives viewers ample opportunity to see him work his screen magic.
My favorite movie in this excellent collection is ""Action in the North Atlantic"" because I think it shows Bogart at his best: The tough guy who makes the hard calls when they need to be made but who is also sensitive enough to keep his crew together through some very rough times. This Bogart is not a private investigator or a gangster but a leader of men in wartime and he played his part so well that the United States Merchant Marine Academy used this movie as a training film for many years.
Bogart won only one Academy Award for his work. I think that too many of those who voted for the Oscars during his career thought of him as a one-dimensional actor who could draw audiences to the theater but didn't do much real acting. In that, I think they were wrong and I think viewers who see this excellent collection will agree.",1441411200,,1205,4.4818181818181815

5082826,4,B007FQXEQO,"I gave this set of Humphrey Bogart films one extra star for the excellent quality of the productions and packaging, the many bonus extras on each disc, and when it comes to Bogie a bad film is almost unheard of; and though WW2 are not favorites of mine, by a long shot, they are each interesting and fine entertainment to different degrees.  The one movie in this collection that is not a war film, ""They Drive by Night"", is the best of the lot, for my taste. and was the primary reason I ordered this item.
A story of two brother truckers, a fine cast that includes my favorite actress Ann Sheridan, even in a supporting role, yet a sizable enough part to make it more watchable and entertaining, as she does with most roles she played, from early career small second or third billed part, to her late main character leads, she is always the stand out character and played in my book.  ""They Drive by Night"" is a great piece of movie entertainment, I enjoyed it above the other three pictures here included, but found the war pictures slow and far fetched, some more minor in plot than others, but if you like those kind of movies I am certain they will more than please most film fans; they just didn't do it for me,",1418860800,4,1218,4.361233480176211

I attribute this to a somewhat weak storyline. Still, it is interesting. A worthwhile addition to anyone's HUMPHREY BOGART library. THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT has Bogie in the background but the sparkling dialogue more than makes up for that. Again, with TCM's CLASSICS, all of the discs are retained on a singular spindle hub (hence the four-star rating). While not a world shaking problem it IS annoying. But, get this set!

Across the pacific: the cast of Maltese falcon pair up for this war drama. Humphrey bogart shines in this twisting story of murder and espionage.
Action in the North Atlantic: a somewhat lighthearted story (until they begin to be followed by u-boats and attacked), about a crew aboard a ship. It has lots of comedic moments and a few sweet ones too.
Passage to Marseille: a movie about the French Air Force. A story told in reverse, starting with the Air Force and ending with bogie's character dying.

5082853,4,B007FQXEQO,"Action in the North Atlantic is excellent historical record of Merchant Marines role in WWll .
The fictional story that makes the film progress is not that great, but the real documentary scenes of the convoy and the Mermansk details are great.  My deceased husband spent Christmas 1944 in a lifeboat in North Sea after sub attack while coming back empty after delivering load of ammunition to Mermansk.  The lifeboat was equipped with water, blankets, and fishing equipment.  They caught and ate raw fish, and were finally rescued by the British.
 What was not accurate in the film story was that if a ship was attacked when fully loaded with ammunition, survival was unlikely.  Also survival on a raft instead of lifeboat was rather farfetched.  But the details of this film match his description of his Merchant Marines experience from the Merchant Marine Academy to Russia, and the huge loss of life.  For many years  the Merchant Marines were not recognized as veterans and were denied veterans benefits, because they served under the Department of Commerce, not the Department of War.",1381104000,10,1090,4.983425414364641

In all the films, Bogart is at his best, providing a powerful way of expressing the thoughts and actions of the character he portrays.  The supporting cast in all of the films is outstanding with actors like Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, George Raft, Raymond Massey, Ida Lupino, Claude Raines, and Ann Sheridan, to mention just a few.  The story in each film is crisp and the storylines move quickly, aided by excellent directing.  Action scenes are done to underscore key elements of the plot, aided by music that dramatizes the events.  These are four, must have films for anyone who likes Bogart and is willing to be swept away by different stories and outcomes during the turbulent years before and during World War II.",1371340800,13,893,4.880794701986755

Well, in some places you know when the film was made -- but that's part of the appeal.  You wouldn't find films like these in our politically correct world today, and we're much poorer for it.
