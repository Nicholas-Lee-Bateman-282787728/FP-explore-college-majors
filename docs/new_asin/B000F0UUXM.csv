8116161,4,B000F0UUXM,"My college purchased both this DVD and ""Beyond Narnia"" as a way to inform students about the life of C.S. Lewis.  Whereas ""Beyond Narnia"" nicely dramatizes Lewis's life, ""Narnia and Beyond"" begins in a bookstore and introduces the idea of fantasy literature by small increments.  Eventually the DVD shows the actual places that formed a background to the author's life.  As such, it offers interesting information.  Unfortunately, the pleasant female voice narrating the script, and the script itself, maintain a pace and tone much more suited to young children than adult learners.  I appreciated the DVD's beautiful locations but chafed at its laborious format.",1231113600,7,663,5.336538461538462

It would have been nice to have had a spin off of the story...where the children who played in it were all grown up...their lives now and them sharing it with their children",1223164800,,247,4.391304347826087
