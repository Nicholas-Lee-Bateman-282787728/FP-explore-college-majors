8193809,3,B000PY52FO,"Great video, explained well and goes through the RV process very clearly.  However, it does NOT include the work sheets and you have to buy the worksheet pdf file on the UFOTV website.  The other issue is that at the end of the video, it gives you ""three"" RV locations to work with.  But instead of three different images, they are all the same.  So I don't get why they are all the same as it defeats the purpose of the ""practice"".  So maybe instead, you can have someone substitute the same images for something else (?).  The entire ending was a real let down since it gave nothing to work with.

however, there are many Remote Viewing (RV) websites that will give you FREE RV location numbers and the images to go with them so you can practice.  I would have loved to give the video five stars but because of a few lame things that did not need to be so careless, I gave it three stars.",1386892800,,890,4.224852071005917
8193810,3,B000PY52FO,"This is a video recording of an actual seminar workshop in Los Angeles on Remote Viewing, but sans any mindazzling fancy stuff; graphics, visual & sound effects, and other usual (over)stimuli to entertain us when we watch a video, but rather its presented in a style which was like sitting in the classroom (which in actuality, hundred$ or thousand$ are charged for). However, don't be under the delusion that you will become a remote viewer after this program. Thats the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Its sound and camera quality are terrific.
 Presented by 2 Remote Viewers, they present the all-important foundational practices (exercises) that the US military spent more than 20-million dollars developing, and that China, Russia and Israel are still working with.
 The program's strong emphasis was on 'how-to'-develop-the-skill exercises, and tips for how to get maximum results (or not) in learning & practising Remote Viewing. I liked that the emphasis was on getting right to the acutal exercises....one could virtually engage as if you were a conference attendee right from your own home. VERY to the point (with virtually no fluffy b.s-ing and mundane chit-chat and 'let me entertain you' type jokes that you usually get in seminars).
Major Ed Dames, who commands most of the presentation, was a very involved Remote Viewer on ""extremely classified 'black' programs"" for the US Military, with a 19 yr history. He was also initially personally trained by THE BEST Remote Viewer known; Ingo Swann.
A fascinating part of this video is the ""interview"" presentation, where Major Ed is asked a variety of questions from: extra-terrestials to terrorism, to angels, to life after death and more. I found many of his revelations astonishing, and not what I expected from a head-on-straight Military Officer. But he is a pretty serious guy through the entire video. Apparently, there is so much that us mere earthly mortals just aren't aware of!
 I was left wanting more of his 'personal' experiences--you know; the shocking 'discoveries and secrets' learned from Remote Viewing during his military career :)",1340323200,5,2110,5.145772594752186
