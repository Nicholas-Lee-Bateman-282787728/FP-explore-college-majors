7812260,4,6301537904,"My name is Dana Augustine and I was the co-story by, screenwriter and associate producer of 'THE BANKER' directed by William Webb.

It starred Robert Forster (and take note, a few years later he played 'Max Cherry' in Quentin Tarantino's  'JACKIE BROWN' for which he got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.)

According to Bob Forster, Quentin Tarantino (in his days as a video store manager) kept 'THE BANKER' on his 'favorite shelf' and that was one of the reasons that he got the plum role in 'JACKIE BROWN.'

Besides all of the other reviews you may have read about 'THE BANKER', please take a gander at 'THE VIDEOHOUND'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO CULT FLICKS AND TRASH PICS' ... as they stated in the review that my script was 'smart and funny.'

(Reading that, my head swelled up so big that I could barely walk through doorways for a month!)

They gave it a rating of '3 and 1/2 Bones' -- and in comparison, you'll notice that they also gave 'BLADE RUNNER' 3 and 1/2 Bones.

I will admit to -- at age 12 onwards of being a huge fan of -- and influenced by the short story 'THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME' by Richard Connell.  (If you wish to read it -- here's the link:  [...] ...)  They have made many film adaptations through the years -- namely, 'THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME' (1932) and 'RUN FOR THE SUN' (1956).

Lastly, this film has fans and a loyal following to boot -- meaning it has become a minor cult hit in some circles ...

For one of many personal examples, I was in a video store once and there was a fella renting my movie. Before telling him WHO I was, in regards as the screenwriter of 'THE BANKER', I asked him what he liked about it. He said, ""Ohh man, it's cool. It's weird. I've seen 4 times already.""

It was because of this movie, I became a commercial director and have 600 plus commercials under my belt and a ton of awards.

I owe a huge thanks to co-producer Kurt Anderson for at first asking me to do some 'punch up the story notes' on the original screenplay -- and that turned into a page-one re-write and for being the best pitching & sounding board of my 'ooh-oohs!  What if they did this -- or he did that' ideas ... especially one of the last lines of the film that always gets a great audience laugh ... 'Well, I'm Dan ... and I'm a cop ... and you're f***ed!'  Kurt has since become a pretty good director of his own films

Thanks for your interest in my little cop / killer thriller.  Now do please enjoy it FINALLY on DVD!  It has taken nearly 20 years for its release -- but that, like some great author wrote, 'is another story.'
