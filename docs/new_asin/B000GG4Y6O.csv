2609414,1,B000GG4Y6O,"After watching season six, I felt Charmed should of been cancelled. Season seven was a little better and the final season was pretty good. Chris was the worst thing that happened to the show. The writing was bad. I don't think the writers had a clue which direction to go. They decided to make Chris Piper and Leos son midstream, due to Holly becoming pregnant in real life. The only thing that made Charmed good after Prues death was Cole, and when he left the show, it really got weak.",1154649600,11,487,4.4222222222222225
2609415,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I really love this season of Charmed! I love how they keep you guessing who Chris was. He was so cute. He made the show more exciting. After they let him go,the show went down hill (of course I still watch til the end).",1154476800,9,219,4.0
2609416,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I refuse to vote over which seasons were better.  In my opinion, I loved all the seasons!!  No matter what episode, the results are the same - Sisters standing united to fight against all the evils in the world and still come out smiling.  I just wish they would just come out with the rest of the seasons so I can purchase them.  Then after I get them all, me and my girlfriend will have a CHARMED marathon.  No commercials!!  Ain't it grand?!!!",1153699200,23,446,4.313253012048193
2609417,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I have been a huge fan of Charmed since the very beginning and to say that a fan has to choose between seasons 1-4 and 5-8 is stupid. Season 6 starts a new direction for the Power of Three. When the Source was killed, the show needed direction. Having demons go after Wyatt was genius. This brings out Wyatt's true power. As far as future Chris, a new Whitelighter had to be brought in when Leo became an Elder in the season finale of season 5 & Chris was a natural choice. Season 6 sets up for the remaining seasons and is non-stop twists & turns. Some will say that ""Wichstock"" is pointless, but this gives the girls a glimps into Penny's past. Yes there will be issues with time travel, but remeber THIS IS JUST A TV SHOW! It is for entertainment.",1153612800,14,750,4.251748251748252
2609418,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I just feel as though I need to vent this to other fans  of Charmed...I was looking on Amazon UK for the HEX DVDs (Awesome show BTW, if you get BBC America from your cable company watch it Thurs @ 10)and I became aware of the fact that they have released up to Season 7 in the UK!!!That pisses me off, seeing that it is an American TV Show!!!I know they stagger the release, probably to hype it up a bit but come on now! Its kinda stupid, but whatever..just 3 more seasons b4 the collections complete..GREAT series finale, very sad :o(",1152835200,7,535,4.245098039215686
2609419,5,B000GG4Y6O,I love this Season! I think it is one of the strongest! I am so glad we find out who Chris is and what his intentions were in this season! because he was really starting to tick me off! hehe! lol! I think Chris is the best part of this season! this season is very much worth buying!,1152144000,17,282,3.8793103448275863
2609420,5,B000GG4Y6O,This is the strongest and more mature season of charmed. No matter what half the fan world of charmed thinks of it. Every episode had completely entertained me. My favorite one is where Wyatt conquered a dragon from a tv.. Boy I thought jeez that kid is so flipping powerful. And the courtship of wyatt's father was another of my favorite. Where Piper finds out that Chris is actually her son Which we all found out in the episode where they found the magic school pheobe finally solved the mystery thank god. This show has grown and envolved. Charmed season 6 is totally worth to buy. I have seasons 1through 5 and it is the best show ever created. Deeply sadden by its end. Charmed season six is and always will be enchanting.,1152057600,23,728,4.481203007518797
2609421,5,B000GG4Y6O,"Season 6 is definately not the average Charmed fans' favorite season but it is definately not the worst of the 8. This season was pretty much up and down, with most of the bad episodes early in the season.  There are however, some interesting plot points in this season. With the addition of Chris in the season 5 finale, we get to learn what he is really up to and if he is indeed someone looking out for the sisters or a new big bad.

The breakdown:

1 and 2. Valhalley Of The Dolls Parts 1 and 2 - With Leo missing, the sisters turn into Valkyries in order to save him.

3. Forget Me...Not - Wyatt conjures a dragon and it is loose in the city. The Cleaners also want to erase Wyatt from everyone's memory.

4. The Power Of Three Blondes - 3 blonde sisters want the Charmed One's identies. Pretty fun episode.

5. Love's A Witch - Paige stumbles upon a feud between two magical families and even finds love at the same time.

6. My Three Witches - Chris tries to teach the sisters a lesson.

7. Soul Survivor - Paige tries to save her boss's soul, even at the risk of losing her own.

8. Sword And The City - Piper pulls Excalibur out of its stone and consequences arise.

9. Little Monsters - The sisters become foster parents for a half demon baby, without Chris' approval.

10. Chris-Crossed - Bianca, a assassin from the future, arrives to try to take Chris' powers.

11. Witchstock - Paige is taken back in time where she encounters Grams, who was a hippie.

12. Prince Charmed - Phoebe and Paige conjure ""Mr. Right"" for Piper as a birthday present.

13. Used Karma - Phoebe is possessed by the spirit of Mata Hari.

14. The Legend Of Sleepy Halliwell - The sisters discover Magic School and must save it from the Headless Horseman.

15. I Dream Of Phoebe - Phoebe frees a genie from a bottle and becomes one herself.

16. The Courtship Of Wyatt's Father - Piper and Leo are trapped in the ghostly plane, with a darklighter on their tail.

17. Hyde School Reunion - Phoebe reverts back to her troublesome teenage self, as her high school reunion approaches.

18. Spin City - Piper is cocooned by the spider demon and Paige, Phoebe and Leo need to save her.

19. Crimes And Witch Demeanors - Darryl is on trial for murder and it is up to the sisters to save him.

20. A Wrong Day's Journey Into Right - Paige conjures up her own Mr. Right for personal pleasure but unbeknownst to her, releases his evil twin, Mr. Wrong.

21. Witch Wars - The sisters are on a demonic reality show, with them as the prey.

22 and 23. It's A Bad Bad Bad Bad World Parts 1 and 2 - Phoebe and Paige are transported to a parallel world where evil dominates everything.",1151884800,189,2653,4.293762575452717

2609608,5,B000GG4Y6O,"Season 6 of Charmed is my favorite season of Charmed for several reasons: Chris, who made his debut in the season five finale, becomes an official cast member and is a total mystery to the Charmed Ones and Leo. Even though he was assigned by the Elders as the Charmed Ones' new whitelighter, the Charmed Ones and Leo try to figure out whether Chris is on their side or the side of evil. We eventually get the biggest surprise of the season and find out that Chris is Leo and Piper's second child and he is finally reborn as a baby boy in the season six finale. Another cool addition was Magic School, an establishment overrun by a headmaster named Gideon, who seems like a nice guy in the beginning eventually turns out to be a bad guy bent on getting rid of the Charmed Ones. Another cool thing about season six is Phoebe's new power empathy. With this new power, she becomes the only Charmed One to possess three different powers and it's funny to watch her get the hang of this new power early on in the season. Unfortunately, she does get stripped of all her active powers towards the end of the season, but does gain back her premonition power in season seven (spoiler alert!).

I guess you could say I enjoy season six for all of the new additions and surprising moments but its those things that can keep an audience on their toes and at the edge of their seat. With that, I must give a hand to all of the brilliant writers involved in season six. I hope this review helps and I hope all of you Charmed fans out there enjoy season six as much as I did.",1412035200,,1559,4.284745762711864

2609648,4,B000GG4Y6O,"Love Charmed, but this season was pretty bad. I can see why it was cancelled. They stopped including any real Wiccan knowledge, the girls started breaking important rules, the laws seemed to change. This entire season felt like filler. Breaking up Piper and Leo was completely pointless. The episodes kept getting sillier. Witchstock was the worst. How badly are the writers phoning it on that one? Their grandmother appeared to be unmarried, child-less, and in her twenties in the era of the 60's, just ten years before the charmed ones themselves were born in the '70's. Their mother didn't seem anywhere near being born yet. Most of the episodes were very bad, but that was the worst. Miss the older seasons!",1395360000,,711,4.884297520661157

2609670,3,B000GG4Y6O,"I've just finished season 6 (have not yet seen 7 & 8). Season 6 is far and away the weakest of the first six seasons. BTW, that image is misleading, Shannen Doherty left after Season 3, and the series never fully recovered from her departure (though Season 4 was pretty good).

The show took a serious tumble with the birth of Wyatt 2/3rds of the way through Season 5 and fell off a cliff with the introduction of Chris (Drew Fuller).

Though to be honest, Season 6 did recover smartly at season's end. Looking forward to the last two seasons.

I remember first watching this in a later season and not starting with season one (I think it may have been season 4 or 5). But overall, I love the series. What I find the most astounding is the feedback I hear regarding Phoebe's empathic power with other viewers and even Piper and Paige. I understand being upset by Phoebe vocalizing feelings they themselves haven't vocalized yet, but it's not like she can honestly turn them off when she wants to. Imagine having to feel the emotions of everyone in a 5 to 10 foot radius all the time. You wouldn't be able to function.",1371859200,,627,4.460869565217391

2609724,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I just purchased seasons 6, 7, 8 of Charmed. I have to say that season 6 is by far my favorite season. There are just so many unique twists and turns in the storylines, specifically concerning Chris and Gideon. My only wish was that more was done with the character of Chris (Drew Fuller) and the future storyline (Chris Crossed). There was so much potential there. I would consider this season to be the year of humor and relationships. Leo and Piper were great this season and had some major challenges, but their reconnection was fantastic in the Courtship of Wyatt's Father. The final episodes of the season Spin City, Crimes and Witch Demeanors, a Wrong Day's Journey into Right, and Witch Wars had some great family bonding in them and were very humorous. Phoebe was just so much fun and so entertaining as she tries to search for the ""father of her future child."" Paige is so entertaining when working with leprechauns and fairies. This is such a creative show! Love every minute of it!",1361836800,,993,4.6477272727272725

2609767,5,B000GG4Y6O,"One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. ""Early Edition"" and ""Charmed"" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.",1310256000,,992,4.7398843930635834

2609774,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I actually just have a chance to watch the rerun version at TNT around october last year before I go to university in some morning. I don't have a continue watching as much as I want but I'm not so worry because the story is not much of the connection that make me need to pay more concentration on it. Until season six has start. The story about Chris, Piper and Leo try to protect there kids are so  much entertaining until I feel like it's the time that I need to have more concentration on it. That is the time I buy season 6 and it didn't let me disappointing. So I buy until the finale season. I never have an Idea about buy the whole season before until I finish season six it make me really want to know more about Halliwaell sister in addition my friend told me that season 1 to 3 are more interesting so now I'm own almost the whole season which I've plan to own them all soon. I know some argue about Paige and Prue and later it make me take a day to read about this detail of Prue left the show. I totally understand if someone will love Prue so much because she are more powerful and focus on every job than her sister and it seem like she is the best performing than her sister. However, time has change and I feel sad to about Prue that left the show but the other sister are growing in acting and power so I feel like they do there job very well otherwise I'd not continue watching them until I need to buy the whole story like now. I really love paige she and Prue are comparatively beautiful but different character. Paige is cute and seem to have less control the others like Prue (that because she is the youngest sister but I thing at this point I love both of them but may be a little bit more on Paige:).  Buy this time I'm not watch the whole movies yet just season 6,7 and 1. I""d say that if you are real fan of Charmed ones this season is a very good one to watch but beware of addict to it :) because I spend few day to finish it because it so much fun and connect to another episode until you'll forget all about the demon in each episode. I can't wait until I'll watch the whole episode but now I try to start from the beginning to the end to see them growing in many aspect. I truly love this movies it like a fairytale in human acting version and the actor are doing there job very well. If it possible I want to watch season 9 with bringing Prue back and become power of 4 or 5 that would be the best ending that I want.",1275782400,,2452,4.012269938650307

It is a nice was to speed a weekend afternoon when you have just finished a long, bad work week.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy/sci-fi type entertainment.

Besides my dislike for Chris and some episodes I found completely useless such as ""spin city"" - man I hate that one!

It has its high points... I love Rose McGowans hair color during this season! It really matched her complextion - so when she was a brunette suddenly.. That was hard to get used to!  But besides hair, everyones acting is superb, especially Brian Krause - he was really shining the last few years...

2609855,5,B000GG4Y6O,"Here comes another season that's filled with magic, demons, warlocks, more demons, and more warlocks. And who is back to fight these monsters? The Charmed Ones: PIPER HALLIWELL (again played by the beautiful Holly Marie Combs), PHOEBE HALLIWELL (again played by the beautiful Alyssa Milano), & PAIGE MATTHEWS (again played by the beautiful Rose McGowan).

""Valhalley of the Dolls (Part 1)""

Even though Leo is gone, Piper is in a surprisingly good mood, leading Paige to suspect that Leo altered Piper's memory. However, Paige's spell to restore Piper's memory accidentally causes total amnesia.

 ""Valhalley of the Dolls (Part 2)""

The sight of Leo causes Piper's pain to come flooding back, prompting her to stay behind on the island while everyone else escapes. The Valkryies follow Paige and Phoebe across dimensions to San Francisco and wreak havoc on the city. Meanwhile, Paige takes a job as a dogwalker and is amazed when one of her dogs is transformed back into a man.

 ""Forget Me...Not""

When Wyatt inadvertently brings a dragon to life, the Cleaners, a neutral group dedicated to protecting magic from being exposed, take the child away and erase all signs and memories of his existence.

 ""The Power of Three Blondes""

When three evil sisters, Mitzy, Mabel and Margo, magically steal the Charmed Ones' identities and powers, Piper, Phoebe and Paige must convince Chris that they are the real Charmed Ones in order to get their lives back.

 ""My Three Witches""

Worried that the Charmed Ones are drifting apart by putting their personal lives before their ""Charmed"" duties, Chris tries to teach them a lesson by enlisting the help of the demon Gith, who creates an alternate reality for the sisters by tapping into their secret desires.

 ""Soul Survivor""

Paige discovers that her new boss, Larry, made a deal with the demon Zahn, in which he sold his soul for a successful career. Ignoring Piper and Phoebe's plea to not get involved, Paige sells her soul to Zahn in order to free Larry's.

 ""Sword and the City""

The Lady of the Lake appears before the Charmed Ones, pleading for their help in protecting Excalibur, the legendary Sword in the Stone.

A mysterious woman from the future named Bianca arrives to take Chris' powers and bring him back forcefully to the future.

 ""Witchstock""

After trying on a pair of her Grams' go-go boots, Paige finds herself transported back in time to an era of free love and free magic; and discovers Grams, a peace-loving hippie, who is on a crusade to rid the world of evil through the magical power of love, preparing for a ""magical be-in"" at the manor.

 ""Prince Charmed""

After vanquishing a demon from Wyatt's room, Piper has an epiphany and decides to swear off men so that she can devote the rest of her life to raising and protecting Wyatt. Unable to handle Piper's revelation, Paige and Phoebe decide to remind Piper of the importance of love by conjuring up a ""Mr. Right"" as Piper's birthday present.

 ""Used Karma""

Phoebe, Paige and Piper inadvertently expose themselves as witches in front of Jason, causing him to leave Phoebe. Richard casts a spell to free himself of his family's negative karma, but accidentally channels the spirit of Mata Hari, a stripper and double agent during WWI, into Phoebe.

 ""The Legend of Sleepy Halliwell""

Leo's old mentor at Magic School, Gideon, calls upon Piper, Phoebe and Paige to find out who cast the spell of darkness upon the school and conjured up the Headless Horseman (from the story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow), who has been beheading the teachers. Meanwhile, Phoebe is sent on a vision quest by Enola, a young shaman student, and gets a glimpse into the future, where she discovers Chris' true identity.

 ""I Dream of Phoebe""

Phoebe frees a genie, Jinny, from a bottle, only to find that she has been tricked into becoming the genie herself. Anxious to put Leo and Piper back together so he can be conceived, Chris uses Phoebe to make his wish come true, but she takes his instructions too literally. Feeling that he is losing Paige, Richard steals the bottle so he can wish Paige back into his life.

 ""Crimes and Witch Demeanors""

When Phoebe and Paige are caught on tape using their powers, the Cleaners, who prevent the exposure of magic, cover up the situation by implicating Darryl as a murderer and sending him to death row. The sisters call a council of Demons and Elders who oversee all magic to convince them that Darryl should be set free. Instead, the prosecutor, Barbas, turns the proceedings around and puts the sisters on trial for recklessly abusing their powers. Meanwhile, Leo and Chris work together to help free the sisters and Darryl, but the outcome leaves Phoebe stripped of her powers.

 ""A Wrong Day's Journey into Right""

With Piper away at Magic School and Phoebe without her active powers, an overworked Paige re-conjures ""Mr. Right"" for stress relief, but unknowingly releases his evil twin. Appealing to Paige's dark side, Mr. Wrong/Vincent uses his pheromones to trick her into realizing that the only way to achieve her secret desire is to be free and use her magic without fear of consequence, eventually killing her sisters. To prevent Paige from executing his plan, Phoebe goes undercover as one of Mr. Wrong's Demonatrix assassins.

 ""Witch Wars""

Aware that Piper, Phoebe and Paige are on the verge of discovering that he is after Wyatt, Gideon conspires with two demons to make the girls part of Witch Wars, a new demonic reality television show where demon contestants compete in a series of contests to hunt down the Charmed Ones, with the winning demon acquiring the witches' powers.

 ""It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World (Part 1)""

Under the guise of sending Chris back to the future, Gideon creates a portal that puts Chris and Leo in a mirrored world where evil prevails. Phoebe and Paige travel to the parallel universe to rescue Chris and Leo, only to find themselves in a battle with their evil counterparts. Unable to vanquish one another, both sets of sisters realize that Wyatt is unprotected and in danger from Gideon.

 ""It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World (Part 2)""

Upon returning to their own world, Phoebe and Paige realize that their world is now too good, and every little infraction is a capital offense. The shift between universes causes Piper's memory to be erased, and Gideon tricks Piper into casting a spell on Phoebe and Paige so that they, too, forget Gideon's evil intentions. With the Charmed sisters under the spell, Leo and Chris are left to stop Gideon from completing his plan. Meanwhile, Piper gives birth to baby Chris.

2609879,2,B000GG4Y6O,"I am a bit surprised at how many fans actually liked season 6.  This was the season where I became so bored with all they were doing that I actually tuned out half way through the season.  I picked up the DVDs with the intent of giving it a second chance, but I was uninterested to the end.  There are three main reasons I could hardly stand the show at this point: the dialogue is repetitive and ridiculous, the actor playing Chris has virtually no range or charisma regardless of his handsome features, and virtually every episode centers around either protecting or saving Wyatt from demons.  I can't remember how many times I heard Piper exclaim, ""I'm not interested in chasing demons right now.  I'm only interested in protecting Wyatt.""  I very nearly did not pick up season 7 as a result of this creative burnout; but that would have been a mistake as season 7 is a surprise return to form for the Charmed Ones.  If I ever go back and watch the series from beginning to end again I will undoubtedly skip season 6 along my journey.  Two stars, not one, as I am and will forever be a fan of the show.

2609880,4,B000GG4Y6O,"I began watching ""Charmed"" at the end of the third season which was probably considered one of the series' high points. As the show went on, its quality suffered. Still, being the avid collector I am, I have been buying every season as it came out and all of them have been stellar until season 5 (which was just extremely mediocre). I didn't have high hopes for season 6 either because from memory of watching it as it originally aired on the WB, I didn't enjoy it.

Now, watching it again on DVD, it seems the season excels when not having to deal with repeats. That's not to say its continuity is reliant on no repeats, it's just that there are several lackluster episodes in the beginning and having to wait weeks between weeks after each one gets tiresome. On DVD, after watching a mediocre episode you can just skip to the next one.

The season begins with ""Valhalley of the Dolls"" which is one of the worst season premieres in the history of the show. Luckily, as the season progresses it gets better but it doesn't help the the new addition of Drew Fuller as Chris brings down the quality. Apart from being some good eye-candy, the actor just cannot act.

Save for all of those complaints, the other aspects of the show get better. The season finale is one of the best ""Charmed"" has ever had since  season 3.

There are a few episodes that I would say are my favorites but the rest pretty much feels like fill-ins. They were neither climactic nor boring.

2609967,5,B000GG4Y6O,"For those fans who think Charmed jumped the shark with the departure of Shannen Dorhety, think again.  Despite some flaws, Charmed's sixth season proves the show hasn't past its peak.

The season starts off strong with ""Vahalla of the Dolls, Parts 1 and 2.""  These episodes are actually quite ridiculous, and at often times a bit corny-pacifict Leo explains killing Valharies with an over-dramatic ""I've changed.""  But the show has always been entertaining because it embraces its corniness.

The episodes range from lighthearted fillers (Witchstock) to emotionally-charged dramas (Spin City, The Courtship of Wyatt's Father).  None are complete flops, though some struggle more than others.  This season is full of humor and wit that other seasons lacked, making it that much better.  Thankfully, the show seems to know exactly when not to take itself seriously, allowing fairly lame scenarios to work perfectly. In ""The Legend of Sleepy Halliwell,"" the girls' severed heads argure while resting on a table, and somehow it was actually funny.  I don't think any other show could pull that off.

There's a lot of debate over the character of Chris.  But the show really needed a new character to liven things up, and Chris does just that.  Played by Drew Fuller, he first appeared in season five's finale, ""Oh My Goddess parts 1 and 2.""  Drew's acting is horrible early on, but he improves dramatically as the season progresses.  I watched ""Oh My Goddess"" and ""Spin City"" back-to-back and couldn't believe how drastically better he'd gotten.  His storyline is also the only thing that makes the Piper and Leo split bearable.  The timeline stretch to incorporate Holly Marie Combs' pregnancy is annoying, but the story works if you just go with it.

Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs continue to shine as Phoebe and Piper, though Phoebe's hair is awful.  Rose has never been a very good actress, and at certain points seems to have stopped trying altogether. Too bad, concidering Paige gets a massive amount of airtime this season.

The show's not perfect: the major flub in ""Witchstock"" proves that. But any fan of Charmed will love it.  Definately worth buying.",1167868800,7,2164,5.025280898876405

2609969,4,B000GG4Y6O,"Charmed is a fantasy show about 3 sisters who happen to be witches and their lives vanquishing demons on the streets of San Francisco. The show is charming and light with occasional dark elements. The sisters are likeable and funny and wear a number of cute outfits (which you probably would not *actually* wear in S.F. due to fact that its often windy and foggy), but are cute to look at nontheless.

There were things I liked: The separation of Leo and Piper, the introduction of Chris (their new white-lighter), and elements I was 'meh' about: Too much focus on baby Wyatt, the 'magic school ala Harry Potter,' the sister's constant obsession with having their own lives got to be a bit of a drag, and the character of Paige occasionally overshadowing the other characters.

If you are a fan of the series, Season Six was a good entry. If I had a bone to pick with this series, I would've liked to see more solidarity between the sisters. I think they should be beyond the phase of selfish pursuits and using ther powers for personal gain. Part of being a charmed one is about sacrifice and the sisters still act selfish, particularly Paige and Phoebe which is a bit of a drag.

2609970,4,B000GG4Y6O,"Season 6 was the first time in Charmed history that I was really disappointed. Most of the episodes were decent, but I hate how the writers bent the rules this season to make the storyline work. Call me old-fashioned, but I much preferred the very traditional Wiccan customs of the first season.  I hated how pretty much everyone they encountered (demons and witches alike) had the power of telekinesis. I understand it is difficult to come up with a different power for each character in all the episodes, but they used telekinesis to death.

Episodes where I noticed things in particular:

Love's A Witch - OK. This episode basically contradicts everything the Charmed writers established in previous seasons. First of all, since when do witches throw energy balls? That is totally a demonic power. Even evil witches don't have that power. Not classic ones anyway. Secondly, since when does each member of a witch family have the same power? I thought witches were special in that they all had unique powers.

Sword And The City - Clever episode, but horrible acting on the part of the guy trying to get Excalibur from Piper. Also there is a blooper at the end: Paige does not call for the stone when she orbs it to the attic, she just waves her hand and up it goes.

Chris-Crossed - This was one of the best episodes of the season. Finally, we get some answers with Chris and finding Wyatt to be a magical bully is a shocking twist.

It's A Bad Bad Bad Bad World Parts 1 and 2-OK, I get what they were trying to do with this episode and it wasn't a bad idea, but they made it way too complicated. Parallel universes are strange, but all the thinking about the backwards circumstances surrounding the already complex wiccan rules made my head hurt.

Other things that I hated:

1) Chris! His acting started to improve toward the end of the season as did his character, but in the beginning he was awful! He whined every episode about evil getting to Wyatt, and he acted way too cocky around the sisters who have been witches for I believe SIX years now!

2) In the season finale, Leo orbs the mirror down to the underworld as if he were Paige. I'm sorry, Leo is not a witch and elders do not possess the power of telekinesis as far as I'm aware. The same goes for Gideon. He's just an elder, but he uses telekinesis more than Paige does! What's up with that?

3) Paige and Phoebe move out at one point in the season, but within like two episodes they live back in the manor. Bad editing.

4) Phoebe's hair. Short hair just doesn't look good on some people, and Alyssa Milano is one of them!

Things that I liked: I liked the story arcs both with Chris and Gideon. Paige could actually move things around, instead of just to the palm of her hand. Phoebe's empathy power was a nice addition.",1167350400,3,2791,4.461689587426326

I really do like the humor in it and I thought it added nicely to the show. If you're not going to buy all the seasons of Charmed, then you should at least buy this one. The other seasons didn't really have any order to them. You could pick one, watch it, and not have to had seen previous shows to understand. In this season it actionally as some kind of real plot where something new happenes in every episode but it all leads to the end. A Great and by far the best one there is!!!! I do greatly recommend buying them all, though. I never get tired of watching this show.",1165017600,,714,4.070921985815603

2609974,5,B000GG4Y6O,"I've been reading the reviews on this season and a lot of people have issues with the sixth season. After seeing all eight seasons people it wasn't a bad season at all. The last episodes of the season were so good,season seven couldn't help but pale in comparison. To the potential buyers of this season,I would say go right ahead. Without a doubt,season six had more humor than 5,7 & 8 combined. To the people that are saying ""humor? It's supposed to be about the supernatural."" I say lighten up. Over the course of eight seasons,I think you're entitled be silly every once in a while. Yes I could have did without a couple of the episodes,but overall season 6 is one of the better Charmed seasons.",1162857600,5,699,4.511811023622047
2609975,5,B000GG4Y6O,"Another great season of Charmed. Chris Perry was a great addition to the cast and it was fun trying to guess who he was and whether he was good or bad. Almost every epsoide was very good and funny. Wyatt contiuned his mischief with his powers causing all kinds of chaos. Piper, Phoebe and Paige were as wonderful as always. Piper is separated from Leo who became an Elder she focuses her energy on protecting Wyatt and dating again. Phoebe is still a columnist and dating Jason she also gets a new power in empathy which causes all kinds of problems and Paige is trying to find a life outside of magic through temp jobs but each job ends up having a magical reason.",1162425600,3,665,4.370967741935484
2609976,3,B000GG4Y6O,"This season though overall good...leaves the fans of charmed wondering what are the writers and producers and the ""gods that be"" thinking....the biggest problem is that: ""it is obvious (and continues through-out the rest of the seasons even to the grand finally) that Shannen Doherty is not only missing in body but in spirit with a lot of anger and ""what really happened"" behind the scenes still going on. The only redeeming factor in this season is Paige's development which finally finds some substance while the others figure out what they are going to do. Chris is a nice addition, but for those of us who have watched this character develop over the whole series....they took way to much time developing this character....many many episodes too too long.....the bottom line..you buy this season to complete the set and watch it when you want a good night's sleep in your easy chair or on the couch....",1161907200,3,907,4.858064516129033

I am niot going to give that away just in case someone hasn't seen it. Anyways back to the character of Chris. I like the conflict he brings to the plot. I personally didn't like how the character acted in the beginning. By the end of the season, he was okay.  Wyatt uis still my favorite of Leo's and Piper's sons. I also liked Valhey of the Dolls. It is a personal preference because I love norse mythology. I also loved Witchstock. The young Leo looked HOT! Again my personal opinion.

They are all great and need to be looked at as a whole.  Despite a few continuity problems, this season brought something fresh and new to Charmed.  What a great twist;  Chris comes back from the future to save Wyatt and the Charmed ones from a deadly fate.  From the end of season five, I had a suspision that Chris may be Pipers son, I thought, however that he may have been Wyatt at first.  But I rooted for him, despite his scheming at times.  Maybe in the future, writers need to review past episodes of the show they are writing for to avoid messing up details.  You see these these little flaws in so many shows, especially when dealing with time travel.",1158796800,3,801,4.28

As if they have been thinking about the details in all 8 seasons from day one.  I know that's their job, but I'd lose track!  Anyways, so sad Charmed had to come to an end.  I know they were sick of the sisters always being together, but I wish they could have focused on Piper's boys or something with the whole Magic School thing.  I have missed some of Season 7 and all of 8 because the show kept moving around and I didn't get WB, so I'm really glad I can get these on DVD.

'cause, this is another great season show, since shannen doherty left it. paige wasn't great when she took over, but this season brings out the best of her. piper and leo, marriage is never everlasting. come people. do you think couple will stay really together forever. if you grew up in a broken home. than you would understand it. phoebe was awesome this season and she learns of whats to come. now for all who don't like chris. stuff it! because without him where else could the writers come up with next. it would of cancelled probably this season if they didn't add him to the show. even the ratings of this show went back up that year, because of chris's character. plus, this season we see the beginning of a darkerside of life for the charmed ones. some of you fan members may not like the idea of the charmed ones growing up. but i know that change makes a difference, than keeping it mellow like the last five seasons.",1155772800,6,1038,4.411458333333333
2610004,3,B000GG4Y6O,"I always referred to season 6 of Charmed as ""The Bridge"" because of the many directions this season seems to take. I always got the feeling that the writers didn't know which direction to take the characters and the story arcs: Will Piper and Leo finally end their relationship? Will Leo get totally written out of the series? Should they fight more demons, or focus on the struggles of balancing a magical life and a personal one? Should the season be more dark, or lighter? And, most importantly, which age group do they want to reach?

The result was a disjointed season, but still one with a major story arc that has effects reaching into the final two seasons.

The addition of the character Chris was an obvious attempt to attract a younger audience and give the show some ""hunk power."" Leo used to have that role, but now that he's a married father (& older) he lost that title. Budget cuts caused Leo to have less of a role in the season, and caused the producers to cut back on special effects and make up. For that reason, the demons suddenly looked more ""human"" (gone was the red Balthazar type of demon of season 4) and Pheobe lost her power of levitation without explanation.

The biggest event to occur during the filming of this season was the pregnancy of Holly Combs (Piper). Ironically, this gave the season some direction. It was unclear during the run of the season if even the producers knew what to do with Chris, but once they wrote Piper's pregnancy into the script and gave Chris the role as ""future child"", the producers had an arc.

The main arc of season 6 is as follows: (spoiler alert) Chris, the future brother of Wyatt, traveled to the present to prevent his ever powerful sibling from turning evil. The second half of the season is spent on Chris trying to uncover and prevent the ""evil"" that will turn Wyatt and trying to get his parents to copulate in order to conceive him (or he will cease to exist). Unfortuantely, the season was so convoluted that it is still unclear to me what that ""evil"" ever was. The season finale ""It's a Bad Bad World"" contained some major events that built up the audience for the 7th season (my least favorite season of the series), but left me with questions still unanswered. Did Chris ever really discover what caused Wyatt to turn evil? Did he successfully stop it?

The biggest mistake the writers made in this season was the introduction of ""Magic School,"" an obvious allusion to Hogwarts and to ride on  Harry Potter's coattails. It appears the entrance is in the sister's house (well, kind of, it's unclear once again), yet it took them six seasons to find it. Magic School could have been used as a light comic relief addition to an otherwise increasingly dark script, but instead, it teetered somewhere between silly and somber, not really certain which direction in which to go. (Spoiler warning) The fact that a plan to destroy Wyatt was hatched inside the school by its headmaster once again makes Magic School a dark place.

Other story arcs in the season include Pheobe's loss of powers and her search for the father of a future child she saw in a vision, Paige's boyfriend's attempt to ""get in touch with his magical side,"" and the on-and-off relationship with the separated Leo and Piper.

The season did have some excellent episodes, especially once the writers knew what they wanted to do with Chris. The episode ""Chris-Crossed"" when Chris travels forward to his time and meets the future Wyatt is my favorite of the season. The last three episodes includes some very touching and jaw dropping plot twists and ends the season on a strong note.

Season 6, in spite of all its flaws, was an important season in the Charmed universe. Season 7 should have been the last, tying up the loose ends from the series and answering the unanswered. But that's for another review.

If you are a fan of Charmed, you need this season for your collection. If you want to know the entire arc of the series, you likewise need this season, but if you are a casual observer in the lives of the Halliwell sisters, stick with the earlier episodes. This season begins the complex and dark road that leads to the end of the series and attempts to bring the sisters to their destinies.",1155340800,15,4243,4.6005291005291005

Plotholes aside, another good season. Not sure if this show is losing anything yet--maybe it's starting to get a bit better (looking ahead to the Avatars in year 7). Phoebe picks up the power of empathy, Wyatt conjures a dragon, Chris is revealed as Piper's son, magic school, and Gideon the Elder who is trying to kill Wyatt--all in the name of the greater good.
