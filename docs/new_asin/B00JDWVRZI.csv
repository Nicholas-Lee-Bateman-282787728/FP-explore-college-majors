8650103,5,B00JDWVRZI,"This DVD is unlike Harus or Act 1. It is more beauty and the orchestra. The first section of the concert is reasonably good. After the intermission it gets more exciting. Witch Hunt is brilliant. The performance of Mein Herr Marquis is classically outstanding. Tarja's performance overall is pretty fantastic. For the fans, this is worth adding to the collection.",1405900800,2,363,5.066666666666666
8650104,3,B00JDWVRZI,"This is not what I thought it would be. It is a opera like performance with an orchestra with Mike Terranna filling in as the drummer in about half the songs. Tarja's voice is still beautiful, but this is not the symphonic rock we are used to hearing from her.
Some people may like this, but for me, I do not care for the slow stuff.",1403913600,,333,4.0606060606060606
