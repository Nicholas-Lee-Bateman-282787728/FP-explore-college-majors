8218985,5,B000VIWIOW,"I have been hunting whitetails for several years now and I always processing them myself. I have processed over 20 years (at least so far) and believe I have a good idea on how to field dress and debone big game. As I am planning to hunt elk this year I thought I would give this video a try. The video is very useful and gives an excellent idea about how to field dress and debone big animals, using a cow elk for displaying the process. The guy who is field dressing/deboning the cow elk is very knowledgeable and explains the process in details. He also explains that you could do things differently but explains why his way is better and should serve you in the field. The movie shows you the process from different angles so you can see how he is doing things. The guy doing the deboning also explains (and name) some of the different parts of meet and what they are good for (steak, etc.)

The presenter/narrator also explains how to debone each part of the animal efficiently and how to (for instance) break the legs of the elk without a saw, just by using the knife, but at the right part of the joint. He explains that any where else, it would saw the edge of the knife.

I have watched the video more than once to get the hang of how to process/debone some parts.

The video is very useful and I strongly recommend it. Happy hunting.",1369958400,2,1343,4.300395256916996
