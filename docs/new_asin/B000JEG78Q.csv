8150094,4,B000JEG78Q,This was a gift for my husband who really loves Pastor Flemmings sermons.  He was pleased with the dvd.,1453161600,,103,4.421052631578948
8150095,5,B000JEG78Q,"This movie will help soldiers understand that freedom is the key issue they are fighting for. I feel it may help prevent post traumatic stress syndrome, which is a major problem in today's returning warriors. I have given this to Mormons and non-Mormons and recommended that each give it to their chaplain's aide after watching it. It has been well received.",1409616000,,358,4.885245901639344
8150096,1,B000JEG78Q,"The war was started by Lucifer. That ""war has always been with us"" is no reason to perpetuate it. The war in heaven was over agency, whether to compel righteousness or to allow man the opportunity to choose it. The use of force and coercion to compel righteousness was Lucifer's plan, not the Lord's. Voluntary military service has always been discouraged in the LDS church. From the booklet ""True to the Faith"" we read:

""We follow the Savior, who is the Prince of Peace. We look forward to His millennial reign, when wars end and peace will be restored to the earth. We recognize that in this world, government leaders sometimes send military troops to war.... [IF] Latter-day Saints are [conscripted] to go into battle, they can look to the example of Captain Moroni.... [IF] Latter-day Saints [MUST] go to war, they should go...with a desire to do good. They should go with love in their hearts, including those on the opposing side. Then, if they are required to shed another's blood, their action will not be counted as sin."" (p. 184)

This quote teaches us a lot.

1. Latter-day Saints who volunteer for military service are acting unrighteously. This is supported by First Presidency statements saying that war is an unrighteous means of settling disputes. This would make the voluntary participation in war, therefore, unrighteous.

2. Latter-day Saints should only look to Captain Moroni as an example of what to do when/if conscripted to war. The example of Captain Moroni is not an excuse or reason to justify war nor to participate therein voluntarily.

3. War will not always be with us. It will come to an end in the millennium when the kingdoms of this world pass away and the church reigns supreme. Secular authorities and civil governments are the authors of war, not God. Satan may be allowed to prevail for a time, but not always. That depends on you and me as members of the church choosing to follow Christ by renouncing war and proclaiming the gospel of peace.

4. Even conscripts in war are capable of sin and murder if they do not have love in their hearts for the ""enemy"" when required by their governments to kill people. The ""enemy"" may very well be another member of the church who is also an ""innocent instrumentality of his warring sovereign"" because the ""enemy"" is also a conscript.

Elder Robert C. Oaks does not sound like someone who has love in his heart for the enemy and I am sure the enemy would benefit more from the gospel than from compelling them to have a democracy controlled by the United States government or even the United Nations. When Elder Oaks says this,

""The enemy is thought to understand, filled as he is with irrational and passionate hatred for Americans and other freedom-loving troops, those who were there to free him from a tyrannical government and let him enjoy the fruits of democracy...""

he is clouding the waters. Most militaries in the world are not volunteer. They are actually more the ""innocent instrumentalities"" of their ""warring sovereign"" than we are ours. And Elder Oaks wants to fault them for upholding and sustaining their own government, president, king, etc. Where in Article of Faith 12 does it say that a righteous nation has a democracy? Elder Oaks is way off base.

I served in the United States Navy. Voluntary LDS participation in the US Military, in the CIA and in support of current US Foreign Policy (ie. Mitt Romney) have created serious backlash in foreign nations amongst grassroots activists. For example, LDS support for a ""New World Order"" by volunteering their loyalty and service for promotion of the same, and demonizing all who resist it, has caused some people to seek a ban of the LDS from their countries (ie. Russia). In other countries (ie. Yugoslavia and South America) it has caused members in those countries to become the target of terrorist activity. I do not condone terrorism, but that is not an excuse to continue fanning the flames that cause it.  It is disingenuous to provoke terrorism and then say you are being persecuted.  That is fanaticism, not faithfulness.

Those who volunteer military service are neglecting their responsibility and duty to proclaim the gospel by taking oaths that obligate them to destroy those they are in the world and covenanted by baptism to save. I can see no greater way to neglect one's duty to defend one's family and one's religion than to volunteer participation in and support for war (D&C 63:24-35). The Lord has not authorized the use of war or the shedding of blood to promote or defend ""liberty"" or to ""build Zion."" The Lord is not a neo-conservative Zionist that believes the restoration of Israel exists in the creation of an Israeli nation-state from the blood of millions of innocent Muslims and Arabs. Instead, He has commanded the Saints to renounce war and proclaim peace, to mourn the destruction of our ""enemies"" as a requirement coerced by a lawgiver (pagan, atheistic, apostate Christian, secular, antichrist, etc) lacking compassion (D&C 64:13).",1401062400,2,5017,4.84696261682243
8150097,5,B000JEG78Q,I think this is one of the best videos the Church has ever produced. I would recommend it for any LDS person serving in the military and for their families as well.  Very comforting and filled with the Spirit.,1377993600,,209,4.358974358974359
8150098,1,B000JEG78Q,"Being from Scandinavia I had a problem, while I was living in the US, when LDS ward members repeatedly were praying for ""our"" soldiers in a VERY tribal-like and far too un-Christian manner.
I had Jesus words on my mind: ""Live by the Sword, Die by the Sword"" ""Love your Enemies"", etc. ([...]) when I addressed the issue with my Bishop! He thought it was strange that people in Scandinavia did not pray for the same things and gave me this DVD - to strengthen my testimony of Bush-war doctrine. His logic back-fired, because it put a big dent in the testimonies of the Church divine leadership on me and my family.

I do not see how an INTERNATIONAL Church (who claim to follow ""The Prince Of Peace"") can hand out a DVD with quotes like this one from Elder Oaks:
""The enemy is though to understand, filled as he is with irrational and passionate hatred for Americans and other freedom-loving troops, those who were there to free him from a tyrannical government and let him enjoy the fruits of democracy.""
This quote, like the whole DVD, is nothing but American political propaganda - favoring personal policy over the teachings of Christ. Military troops on foreign soil does not promote peace! Let's use LDS lingo: The Iraqis are the Nephites and US are the Lamanites.
Just because it is published by an organization who has hi-jacked ""Jesus Christ"" for inclusion in their title it does not make this DVD, or any other cr*p they put out there, even remotely Christian.

Who would Jesus kill?",1343433600,3,1491,4.643939393939394
8150099,5,B000JEG78Q,Well done video that really hits home with those who have served in the armed forces.  The gentlemen in the video are LDS veterans who know that combat can change a man or woman and leave you with giant holes in your heart.  This video doesn't glorify war but rather helps to ease the burden that so many bring home with them.  Be your own judge and decide for yourself. God Bless our Troops and God Bless America,1315699200,5,413,4.269230769230769
8150100,1,B000JEG78Q,"Is this video being shown to Latter Day Saints engaged in military service other than with the US Army? One wonders how ""foreign"" LDS members (not to mention non members) would react to the appalling statement that the US have only engaged in wars to maintain freedom and democracy (do they mean the Republic?). I understand the necessity to comfort the troops, especially in regards to their spiritual standing. I also understand that we, as Latter Day Saints, have been commanded to be abiding and engaged citizens. But this is sheer propaganda, worship. I do not understand how American troops would need more comforting than, say, German, French, Japanese, Israeli, Lebanese, Korean, Egyptian, Spanish, Mexican, Canadian, British... (you get the idea) troops. Or are there or will there be official church videos for servicemen and women of nations other than the US? Or do they think this one would be comforting to servicemen and women of any nation? Or should we even worry about servicemen and women and people of other nations?
Troubling indeed.

And, please, turn the music down when you talk!",1289260800,3,1103,5.027322404371585
8150101,5,B000JEG78Q,"I'm an active LDS member who retired from the military last year, after 36 years of military service.  I saw this video for the first time in Nov 2008, during LDS chruch services at Lackland AFB.  It is a moving, thoughtful, and meaningful message from senior church leaders, including President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Boyd K. Packer, Elder Robert C. Oakes, and Elder Lance B. Wickman. It touched the hearts of myself (a 36-year veteran), my wife, and my son - who had just completed Air Force basic training.

This would be a wonderful gift for any LDS military member.",1231027200,5,577,4.75
