8658773,1,B00KH6HXVQ,I picked this up at Costco for $25. I didn't know exactly what the DVDs would deliver...but I was excited to find out. It was hard to understand a lot of the interview answers from band members due to the quality of the audio recordings and without any video footage of them talking; and the soundtrack was mostly generic music composed and performed by some bargain recording artist. A documentary like this really needs the band's original music to drag me in. I was ready to fall in love with this. Epic fail.,1426118400,4,512,4.516129032258065
8658774,3,B00KH6HXVQ,Another documentary that's like all of the others. And this one's not authorized by the band. If you seen any of the dozens of other documentaries you should save your money because this is exactly like all the others. Nothing new at all !!!,1416182400,5,241,4.5
8658775,1,B00KH6HXVQ,Although I'm a huge fan of Led Zeppelin ! I always want to know or find out new stories about them. After purchasing many documentaries on them I've pretty much seen them all. Beware that these are of the same even if they re-title these and package them. These are all the same. I think it's wrong to take advantage of Amazon customers by re-selling the same product in a different package. This was my first time making a review. I just didn't want others to fall for the same thing I did.,1405900800,35,491,4.290322580645161
