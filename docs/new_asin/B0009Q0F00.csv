2311603,2,B0009Q0F00,Sound poor - images grainy - resolution of titles/cast were extremely out of focus.  I've seen better quality camera captured movies - perhaps this is one!  I had never seen but enjoyed songs from the soundtrack.  Ordered in hope that soundtrack recordings would be as good as CD sound track - Sadly disappointed!,1317340800,2,313,4.867924528301887

8065250,1,B0009Q0F00,"I'm a movie buff. I own more than 700 DVDs and have watched thousands of movies. I can say without a second thought that this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen in my life!!! I bought it because of the 1978 Chuck Mangione album, ""The Children of Sanchez"" that was made as a soundtrack for this movie. That's still one of my favorite jazz albums, but this film is an abomination for such a masterful sound track. Horrible! I can't believe Anthony Quinn did this movie. Ugh!",1432425600,2,473,4.325842696629214

8065253,3,B0009Q0F00,"It goes with the soundtrack CD I purchased. Didn't care for it and probably won't ever watch it again. Predictable, not a great transfer to DVD. Tried to enjoy it, surprised Anthony Quinn took the part.",1394409600,3,202,4.638888888888889
8065254,3,B0009Q0F00,"This is one of those movies that had really great potential, but for some reason or another, my gosh, was made forgettable instead. There is some wonderful, great music, provided by Chuck Mangione, et al. When one thinks about the quality of this music, the composing, recording, and production that went into this music at then A&M Studios in Hollywood, and then to have this music placed on top of a movie that, at times, seems like it was photographed for that junior high or high school project, well, that about says it all. The other reviews that this movie had to bare are spot on: The film is grainy, dark, spliced - in as much as the great tradition of Saturday afternoon pel&iacute;culas at the local movie house in old Mexico must have been! The question is why? How could a soundtrack be so superb, and the movie for which it is supposed to be background music to be so poorly addressed with this bad cinematography? That is the main drawback to a more pleasurable experience of this movie.

  As far as the story line goes, I guess it may be said to be ""predictable"" for what one may stereotypically expect of a poor, arguing, Mexican family living in the barrio. Jesus Sanchez has dreams of moving his family to the hills outside of Mexico, and he finally accomplishes his goal toward the end of the film, but at what price to his family during the interim? Consuelo, the rebellious daughter, plays a part which lies about three inches short of insanity at times, and, my gosh, if I were Se&ntilde;or Sanchez, I would have lost it with her a long time ago. That conflict is continually played out in the movie. The rest of the family submits to the usual indecencies of an undisciplined life, with Se&ntilde;or Sanchez claiming to a dying grandmother that he ""loves his children."" Wow! That is tough to gather from the scenes which precede such a statement.

  I have no doubt that Oscar Lewis spent quite some time observing and researching the Sanchez family, if that were their real names. The story, however, is desperate, and lacking in compassion. My gosh, is this typical Mexico? Now we know why the reasons for immigration to el Norte!

  Perhaps this is a true story of how all family members try to carve out their own lives, free from their father's grip. There is no doubt that Sanchez loves them, but he does so in a very coarse and crude manner. Anthony Quinn knows how to play this all very well. I am certain it wasn't easy for him growing up in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, where he may have learned some of these disturbing, if not violent, acting ""techniques."" If he was meant to play ugly, he does it well in this movie - a sort of very ""tough love"" toward his children.

  I wish the cinematography would have been better, though. That way, the movie would probably have reached a broader audience and would have garnered much more respect, if not awards, also. It's a tough film to watch with its representation of gritty, street life in the barrio of Mexico City. When Jesus finally does make it to his own land in the hills, he wishes some neighbors in the barrio a cheerful good-bye. All Sanchez gets is ""Bye,"" if that at all. This is tough stuff.

  Anthony Quinn probably didn't make many more movies after this one. Was this his last? Was this his nunc dimittis for his Mexican roots? I only wish that the cinematography would have equaled some of the acting and definitely the excellent music by Mr Mangione with his crack, virtuosic musicians.",1391385600,5,3493,4.548644338118022
8065255,2,B0009Q0F00,"The movie is very good. I saw it years ago when I was in high school. Wanted to relive the good memories, but the quality of the picture is very poor on this DVD. I do not think it is a DVD quality at all. It seems like a 720 resolution. The sound is even worse. It is so poor I had to increase the volume 4 times the normal level and then all the other background noises are extremely exaggerated against the voices of the actors. Even with the volume up it is still hard to understand the speech. The music by Chuck Mangione is great, but the effect is lost with the poor quality of the soundtrack. This DVD copy feels like it is a home production video, not a professional DVD release. Although I want to see the whole movie I stopped watching it after the first 15 min. due to the above quality issues. I paid for the DVD $9 or $10 and in my opinion it is worth $1 in the form it is recorded. I recommend the movie, but not from this manufacturer.",1391126400,3,951,4.037037037037037
