2021495,5,B0001O3YLM,What can I say ? Simple the most engrossing tv show right now ! Can't wait for season 2 ! Nicely packaged DVD set....Great entertainment...You're in for a treat !!!,1087257600,,164,4.5
2021496,3,B0001O3YLM,"Is it outrageous? Of course.  Is it ridiculous?  You bet.  Is it depraved?  Most definitely.  Is it a joy from start to finish?  Absolutely.
The latest and greatest to come from those sensationalists over at FX, ""Nip/Tuck"" is best described as a soap opera on steroids (or perhaps cocaine would be more appropriate).  Everyone on the show is impossibly good looking, everyone talks with slickness that could only be provided by a writer, and everyone has lots and lots of [adult relations].  The plots are fast and loose, and only get faster and looser as the season progresses (for proof, look no further than the season finale).  Only the subplot involving Sean's marital crisis keeps the show from spinning off into oblivion.
Not that all of this is a bad thing, of course.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed watching a show this much.  When I sit down to watch ""Nip/Tuck,"" I know that there will be plenty of debauchery before the show is finished, and I am never disappointed.  The show keeps piling on one outrageous moment after another (the gerbil incident, Matt's ""surgery,"" the porn party) and never stops to look back.  All of this gives the show a melodramatic quality, which for me is half the fun since my roommate and I watch it together and provide a running commentary on the sheer ludicrousness of the whole thing.
The reason I gave this show 3 stars, and the reason I don't see myself buying the DVD, is that the show is too slight for its own good.  It doesn't have any depth, and I doubt repeat viewing would bring anything new to the show.  Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm not tuning in to FX on Sunday nights to catch the encore showings of the episodes I've missed.  A-/B+",1083888000,11,1709,4.554098360655738
2021497,5,B0001O3YLM,"Awesome.  I happen  to have the displeasure of knowing a couple of genetic hybrids who have gone under the knife for bigger bust, smaller noses, and better lifes. This show represents them in all thier mangled glory.  When seeing the prievews, i thought it would be just another show writing scripts and characters around sex, but it's actually one of the smartest shows on TV.  The characters are unbeliveably real.  This show drags these people who can't live without being more bueatiful out into the light of day and exposes how pathetic they truly are.  Still though, you can't help but feel sorry for them.......at times.",1081641600,6,627,4.867924528301887
2021498,5,B0001O3YLM,"I absolutely love this show.  The first time I watched it, it seemed to much like an ultra-violent soap opera and I wasn't sure if I liked it.  I watched the second episode and it grew on me and by the third episode I was hooked.  It's so over-the-top that you can't help but be entertained.  They should put it on HBO or something so they don't have to hold back on anything.  You can tell the show wants to be worse, content wise, than it already is.
  The one thing I find odd about this set is that it's five discs.  That seems a little weird considering that there were only 13 episodes in the first season.  This set should be 3 discs, 4 at the most.  The first two or three should be just episodes then either put the Special Features on the third or on a fourth disc.  The price seems a little high, but it's totally worth the money.  Wow Nip/Tuck Season 1, Simpsons Season 4 and Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 2 on the same day.  I can't wait!  Second season starts June 22nd. YES!",1080864000,9,987,4.1534391534391535
2021499,5,B0001O3YLM,"This show is incredibly addictive and is as good as t.v. gets period!  This show is easily on par (if not better than) with Six Feet Under, Sopranos, West Wing or any other drama on t.v. If the second season is as good as the first and it gets snubbed by the Emmys and Golden Globes then those awards will be even more worthless then they already are.  It's too bad this show is done through FX and not one of the main networks (NBC, ABC, CBS)or HBO otherwise everyone would already be watching it.",1080086400,6,498,4.231578947368421
2021500,4,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/tuck is a strange show, italian Tv has been broadcasting the first few episodes in the last weeks and I found myself strangely (and unexpectedly) hooked. A previous review states that this is a realistic show... well, I wonder if the reviewer watched it or merely pretended to! This show presents an hyperbolic display of our society, focusing (morbidly) on its vices. It's all about sex, mental disorders (beauty-obsessed ones), cynism, money, lust, etc. It WANTS ro shock you and outrage you and pays little attention to the likelihood of the picture. Maybe one or two of the things mentioned in the show could happen to you in real life but a setting where they seem to happen to everybody, over and over again, is extremely unrealistic. Maybe this exaggeration was intended to make the underlying denounce more effective or maybe it was just shock-marketing, ""pater les bourgeoises"".
But then, maybe it's the morbidness that makes this series compelling. The plot is very engaging, just make sure you don't show this to your children!",1079740800,26,1042,4.994252873563219
2021501,5,B0001O3YLM,I started watching Nip/Tuck when my girlfriend recommended it to me and i was hook right away. Every week i would watch this show and insist on NO Interuptions. This was my fav. show on TV. I cant wait for it to return witht the second season. I will surly buy this DVD as soon as it is availible.,1079481600,4,297,4.0508474576271185
2021502,5,B0001O3YLM,"It had been awhile since I had picked a show that I really liked and sat down to watch it every week on cable television. Then I saw the advertisments for Nip/Tuck and I was intrigued. Watching the show was every bit as rewarding as the previews suggested it would be.
 A story of two plastic surgeons in the middle of their lives. They make a deal with the wrong kind of man. This of course starts a series of a events and soon their lives are spiraling downward and they are left frantically trying to get it back in control. It seems each time it couldn't get worse, it does.
Suspense and suprises in every episode, and the realistic characters make it believable. Their marriages aren't perfect, they make deals with the wrong people, lie, and cheat, but there is an honesty that really endears them. It is sometimes gory in surgery and I have a hard time watching it but I got through it (I am VERY squeamish when it comes to surgery) so it shouldn't be a problem for most people. However with somewhat touchy subjects, such as sex changes, the show is not for everyone though I would highly recommend it.",1078704000,7,1110,4.414634146341464
2021503,5,B0001O3YLM,"This show is amazing, I watched the first episode and was a little apprehensive because it was so gory and so shocking but I think that was the point, was to get people talking and get the viewership going into the second episode. The acting is amazing, the storylines are great, shocking, and leave me counting the hours till the next episode. I will definately be getting this dvd the day it comes out in preperation for season 2 which should be great to. I recommend this show to everyone!!",1078617600,5,493,4.488888888888889

2021513,4,B0001O3YLM,"Twisted, racy, and entertaining. Nip Tuck is a great series.  Each episode features a new client seeking out a little nip here and a tuck there.  I actually found myself looking up some of the procedures they were doing!  Even though each episode introduces a 1 time character in most cases, there is a very deep story line that evolves through the main players in the series.  The acting is amazing and you will find you have those characters you love to hate and ones that you connect to.  Even though the events in each episode are different, this is something that you do have to watch in sequence of else you will get lost. Happy binging!",1489536000,2,643,4.461538461538462

2021580,4,B0001O3YLM,I love this series. I'm obsessed watching it for the second time all seven seasons.

If they can't do it in Miami or at least do the exteriors there, then set the show in Southern California.

 Not only is the show way hot, but the characters will draw you in. The story line is very complex. You will become involved in these Doctor's lives. They are involved in far-fetched plastic surgeries, steamy love affairs, wild sexual encounters, and even the drug underworld. Their families are just as bizarre. Son, Matt, is a young man who is ""learning"" about life from all the wrong mentors. Sean's wife, Jewels, tries to do the best she can as a parent but her longing for love takes her places she should not go. Christian lets his nether regions control his life.

The surgery on the show is very accurate and the drama is ...dramatic.  But the issues are real issues and that is what makes the show interesting.  I bought this as a gift and it was delivered very quickly and packaged correctly.

The show is about two plastic surgeons that run a business together.  During their business practices, we learn about their personal lives and see their own struggles with materialism, aesthetics and ""looking their best"" to attract customers.  We also see the desperation, hope, successes and failures of the clients that come in asking for plastic surgery.  The show delves into healthcare issues such as patient education, the aftermath of surgery and mostly the issues that surround what lead people to want plastic surgery (and there are MANY reasons, both good and bad).",1383004800,,933,4.9423076923076925

I had taped it, and watched it several times before the next episode aired!  Season 1 is one of my favorites.  I love the introduction to all of the characters.  I felt like I actually knew each one of them personally!  The acting was fantastic.  The writing, directing, producing -- everything -- was unbelievably excellent!  As soon as Season 1 was available on DVD, I bought it.  I moved a couple of years ago, and ended up losing a box full of DVDs.  All of my Nip/Tuck DVDs were in the box.  The other day, I was bored, and decided to watch the pilot on Netflix.  I was once again hooked.  I have now bought Season 1 and 2, and will purchase all the seasons!

There were some days were I was watching this show, and looked at my phone, and realized that I had spent the entire day doing nothing but laying on my bed and watching Nip/Tuck. I didn't even eat anything! Anyways the series is a nail biter! Liz Cruz is hilarious, Kelly Clarkson plays a character who is someone so not like her, Ladies... Christian, and Sean aren't hard to look at are they? I mainly bought this because when I was in middle school (2006-2008) I just got into the show, I saw the very first episode when I was 9, 4 years later, season 4 has started... I was up later, couldn't find anything to watch, and I couldn't sleep so I came acrossed this show, I was like what it this?! I was hooked, I watched most of season 4, I was only 13 during this season so after staying up late watch Nip/Tuck 11:00pm - 12:00am I was tired in the mornings. I kept watching, I eventually lost track the episodes, and suddenly Kimber was prenant, Matt was a Meth Head, Julia was a lesbian, and I have no idea who this Connor kid was at first. So I watched season 6, hoping for another season, than that was it. Years later, I got a job, and discovered this good/bad thing call Amazon.com, when I was looking for a CD for cheap, and I found it on here. 67 packages in the last 2 years later... I am an addict! I bought the whole series, and I was very excited to start watching this again, and being old (19 year old, and in college) I understand it.

So now I have finished the whole series, and it is so nice to know that I can restart the the series all over again whenever I want. Now if only SVU was cheap on here, I would never go outside.",1349395200,,1768,4.12463768115942

2021881,3,B0001O3YLM,"Seasons 1 and 2 of Nip/Tuck were brilliant. And I mean it. I think the writing was one of the best in television history: intelligent, engaging, thought provoking, edgy and just breathtaking. It set the standard for TV dramas and writing in all subsequent years if you ask me. The story lines were believable yet provocative and the topics picked were right at the heart of the matter. Because the characters were written with so much depth, layer and nuances, their struggles were believable and the audience could identify and often sympathize. For the first two years I really believed this to have been the best TV drama I had ever seen.

Unfortunately, it all went downhill starting Season 3. I don't know if they changed writers or just got blinded by their success and didn't try as hard, but Nip/Tuck made a downhill run starting in Season 3 until the abysmal failure which was the last season: increasingly improbable, far fetched situations that take the notion of suspending disbelief to new heights, bad to no character development (at least not one that is believable), unimaginative writing that is all over the place, everyone acting supremely out of character...I could go on with more examples. There just wasn't much depth in the characters later on and in fact at some point they became a parody of themselves it seems. The writers took the ""sudden twists"" in plot development that were gripping and enticing in the first two seasons and sprinkled them excessively in every episode to the point where it became almost ridiculous. While in the beginning they used those sparingly to get the desired effect, it was just overdone in later seasons - ultimately causing the show to lose exactly what it tried to accomplish.

As mentioned above, people behaving out of character was another prominent feature of the later seasons:

Yes, Christian Troy is a womanizer and playboy who loves luxury, hot girls and shiny cars, but he is also a wounded soul, a caring man who deep down has demons to fight while at the same time trying to hold on to certain principles he would never relinquish. In later seasons, they just turned him into a vile, ruthless, unsympathetic, one dimensional animal who is lacking a moral center. While he had some endearing qualities in the beginning, he had none in the end. He was a weak, mean coward who lost his edge and humanity.

Sean, who was always the thoughtful, loyal, dedicated and responsible person and especially father, was turned into a big time jerk and sex maniac in the later seasons - a man who had no interest in his family and his children and who slept around and used people.

The same is true with most of the characters really. Julia, (Joely Richardson), was a driving force in this series. Her struggles of wanting to go to med school and being more than just a house wife, as well as her subdued, unspoken love and attraction for Christian were an important relationship and plot element. Gradually, she made fewer and fewer appearances, however, became a lesbian at some point (yeah right) - stating she had always been one - and then she sort of disappeared for extended periods of time without explanation or closure. Her passion for medical school and her own life were never even touched upon again and she herself disappeared into obscurity. That was sad, because Julia's presence and the tensions that had developed between her, Christian and Sean were at the heart of the show and its drama. They spent two years building all that up just to drop the subject altogether and never revisit it again.

Speaking of unresolved: Gina just completely disappeared at some point without explanation and then came back just to die in the most absurd, ridiculous way you can imagine: she fell during sex out of the balcony. I really thought they were kidding and this was just someone's day dream or imagination but lo and behold, that was it: she really fell off the balcony during sex. Not only was that ridiculous but also sad in a way and just insulting to what the writers had done with the character in the first place. I always found Gina very fascinating and tragic; the self destruction, low self esteem, the fact that she was Wilbur's mother and her battle with HIV. Her character was filled with potential and they just let her fizzle out and then die in this embarrassing, trashy manner. Totally insulting. I wonder what Christian will tell Wilbur when he asks about his mother one day.

There is also Kimber, another deeply tragic character who ended up being very underutilized given the potential the writers had with her. They did an amazing job exposing her self destructive tendencies and low self esteem, but then just like that, they dropped her and she too became a two-dimensional paper doll and a clich. Christian marries her on and off over the seasons, but nothing in their dynamic with each other changes. She doesnt develop as a character for either the better or the worst. I saw a glimpse of hope when she got that abortion and it turned out she could never have kids again - gosh that entire plot segment was filled with potential for her character and the implications of that for Christian - but instead of keeping going on that strong note, they just dropped it and let it fade away. The same thing happened when she died. Did she commit suicide? Is she dead? Is she alive? What exactly happened? We never find out. Her death was not remarkable to anyone - which it should have and could have been had the writers not been so busy making up far fetched bogus stories.

There is also that entire plot of Christian marrying Liz. Speak of behaving out of character: Liz always held herself and others to the highest standards. She had a disdain for Chrstian's superficiality and how he used and treated women and she was fully aware of it too. She would *never* have stooped to his level and married him. That was just not her. But they put it in the script and made her whine after Christian and it was ridiculous.

If these were changes in plot and character the writers intended, they should have gone about it in a different way (even though there is no excuse for some of the outlandish plot twists they introduced).  People don't just change overnight and fiction or not, you still have to adhere to certain rules such as character consistency within a plot. Sean was portrayed from the beginning on as a hard working, ethical, dedicated father. It is completely out of character for him to suddenly turn into a vile jerk who uses women and doesnt care about his kids. Liz would never have fallen for Christian's sweet talk and married him and then pine away after him, that is ridiculous - not to mention that she is a lesbian.

Of course it is possible for people to change but there has to be evidence for it in the story and plot and not simply because the script says so. The later seasons are drizzled with even more such inconsistencies, which is a sign of bad writing more than one of just things having changed due to the circumstances the characters find themselves . Acting out of character is not character development.

Finally, changing the setting from Miami to L.A. aided in ruining the show completely. The L.A. setting made them be nothing but a bunch of cheap, trashy, run of the mill Beverly Hills plastic surgeons trying to find a way to sell out to the media by humiliating themselves - sort of like the Kardassians. There is some kind of a mystery, sexiness and just boldness to Miami which L.A.'s theme-park commercialism lacks. In the show, L.A. was portrayed as a den for greedy TV producers and dumb people with non-existent moral codes willing to do anything for a dollar, a d-- ck and a dream. McNamara and Troy just became pawns in that scheme and the stories shifted from them to Los Angeles, the dirt of that town and the despicable people roaming it (to the point of stereotyping the city).  That was a bad move which, in my opinion, pretty much sealed Nip/Tuck's ruin and reduced its quality to just any other forgettable TV show you hope to end.

The bottom line is that after the success of the first two seasons, the show's producers and writers put the characters into increasingly more improbable situations to the point of turning them into clichs of themselves and the show as such; coupled with the issues mentioned above - such as character inconsistency and poor, chaotic plot development - the result has been that over time a serious disconnect has been created and once you have too many of those disconnects, you lose credibility. And I think that is the main breaking point in the end: the show lost a lot of credibility, unintentionally became a farce of itself and with that it lost the edge and brilliance that made it so amazing and intense in the first place.",1303776000,,8814,4.6634491634491635

2021887,5,B0001O3YLM,"With more freedom to explore edgier subject material, series television on cable networks, has made huge strides in the last decade.  FX's Nip/Tuck (2003) is certainly a striking example, as it explores the practice of Miami plastic surgeons Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh).  Life in the fast lane in south Florida, is a mix of affluence, sex, style, sleaze, superficiality, and excess.  That the series explores different facets of beauty and aesthetics, is not unexpected.  That the doctors' personal lives and relationships, are interwoven deeply into to drama, might also be expected.  However the introduction of a dark criminal element, illegal drugs, drug money, and murder, separates Nip/Tuck, from your average, slick medical drama.

The heart of the series is the relationship between Sean and Christian, two long time friends who seem to be have totally opposite personalities and lifestyles.  Sean is a skilled surgeon, who appears to be dedicated to his wife Julia (Joely Richardson), and family.  Christian uses his good looks and prestige as a surgeon, to try and bang every hot chick that comes his way.  Aesthetician Liz Cruz (Roma Mafia), helps keep the practice viable.  The graphic presentation of various surgical procedures, will become one of the trademarks of the series.

There are some occasional slips, but Nip/Tuck is generally superbly written, with extremely compelling stories, that are often provocative, controversial, and touching.  There are some superficial characters, and some seemingly unrealistic situations, but the writing and acting is often so solid, that it overcomes weaknesses.  Even the unlikely, can seem quite palatable.  The series shifts focus onto different characters, often exploring offbeat subjects, and taking many dramatic twists.  Give the show half a chance, and Nip/Tuck can become quite addicting, as it is easy to develop connections with the various characters.

The show's talented cast is a huge plus.  John Hensley, aged 26 at the time, convincing plays 16 year old Matt McNamara, who not only tries to remove his own foreskin, but also runs over a classmate.  Kelly Carlson (The Marine), is Kimber Henry, a striking beauty, interested in going from an 8, to a 10.  She is under the mistaken impression, that Christian has a heart.  Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz) the office psychologist, is not quite the detached, all business professional, she appears.  Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig) takes Christian to a place no other woman has before, and then delivers an ironic surprise.  Dr. Merril Bobolit (Joey Slotnick), provides contrast, as a rival plastic surgeon, who has an attitude similar to Christian's about the business, and what constitutes success.  And Robert LaSardo is a deadly snake preying on humanity, as ruthless drug dealer Escobar Gallardo, a man who threatens to destroy many lives.

With a certain voyeuristic appeal to peer into a world based largely on superficiality, and artificial enhancements, Nip/Tuck is not for everyone.  The attitude expressed towards women, by doctors Troy and Bobolit, may not be laudable, but it just one of many points of view explored, in this very compelling drama.  Nip/Tuck is currently winding up its sixth, and final season on FX.  Check it out on cable, to see if it catches your fancy.  See how it all began in season one, with an intense amount of drama, contained in just thirteen wickedly provocative episodes.",1271289600,,3468,5.256363636363637

If you have problems with sexual situations (and a lot of them), nudity, violence, drinking, and drugs, then (again) this show is not for you. (and by problems, I mean repulsed by it)
Also, on a side note, if you are not willing to sit through at least 3 episodes to get into a show, then it's not for you...

THAT BEING SAID...

This show is fantastic. If you can get past those things, or they don't really effect your feelings towards it, then this show really is very interesting. It is sordid and twisty, and has some drama and intense story lines that really draw you in. Once you get into it, you will have a hard time turning away from it. It can be compelling, interesting, and (at a lot of parts) just a little bit wrong.

I have tried to get a few friends into it, but it seems like the first episode by itself turns them off from it. I suppose if you try to sit through 2 or more, you will start getting into it.

The seasons get better and better after this point (well, except in my opinion until season 4 or 5, I can't remember). Give it a try if you are interested, and wait until at least the 3rd episode before you form your own opinion.",1260230400,,1304,4.288617886178862

2021989,5,B0001O3YLM,"Have you ever watched a show so powerful that you can't wait until the next episode? Among a string of wonderful new shows on the FX Network, Nip/Tuck was a jewel! It is edgy, brilliant and definitely well written. And I love the fact that there is always some plot twist that was completely unexpected.

For an hour (probably more like 35 to 40 minutes) you enter a world the superficial world of brilliant Plastic Surgeons Sean McNamara and Christian Troy. Beginning each consultation with ""tell me what you don't like about yourself"", they set out to fix or improve those things that their clients hate about themselves. Everything it appears can be fixed with the services of a fine surgeon and a scalpel.

Sean (played by Dylan Walsh) is the more talented Surgeon whose life appears on the surface to be perfect (2 kids and a loving wife, Julia). Conservative and straight laced, Sean is the perfect alter-ego to sex crazed Christian.  Christian (played by Julian McMahon of Charmed) is the more sophisticated of the two, but finds himself ""bedding"" one woman (and sometimes two) in every episode. Having one meaningless sexual relationship after another, appears to interest him more often than a complicated surgery.  Liz, their anesthesiologist and friend, is constantly trying to show Christian the error of his ways, while assisting them both by performing some very complicated and creative surgeries. Soon you will find that the creative and wonderful storylines have pulled you into the dazzling world of McNamara-Troy, and you have simply fallen in love with this wonderful show, and looking forward to every episode. I can only hope that Season 2 lives up to Season 1.  I am extremely pleased that FX took a chance on this series, because the world is definitely ready for it.",1216166400,,1791,4.917218543046357
2021990,5,B0001O3YLM,"Definitely not for everyone.  Those with sensitive stomachs will not appreciate the close-ups of the plastic surgery, while certain sensibilities will be offended by the sexual activities of the various characters.
Other than that, there is a lot to bite into here.  Two best friends are plastic surgeons and face a constant barrage of ethical dilemmas, challenging patients, a dangerous drug runner who forces them to remove heroin from female ""mules,"" and more.
Then there are the family conflicts.  Dr. MacNamara's wife was close to his partner, Dr. Troy, who is now the godfather (and possibly father!) to their kids.  Troy himself has a troubled past that causes him a lot of distress when he confronts a priest who has been molesting boys.
And MacNamara and spouse very nearly destroy their marriage with infidelity, lies, and secrets; while their teenage son experiments sexually and also tries to cover up a hit-and-run that he was involved in.
Slick Miami settings and messed-up people who are attractive on the outside but damaged goods inside make this unpredictable, shocking, and memorable.",1199923200,,1103,5.179775280898877

Other reviews can tell you the synopsis.

I love the fact the series doesn't make apologies for itself and even if the characters are being hypocritical or idiots, it's obvious to the viewers, but it's not trying to force us to say that they're right. Yes, the characters can be vapid and stupid. Yet the parts that make you think are really more the people who come in and out of their lives. Sean's character I can't stand, but like any good character foil is needed. Yet, if the characters were great and wonderful and you loved them to death and they did the right things... well.. it wouldn't be a guilty pleasure, would it?

And yes, the surgeries are graphic. I don't mind watching the lipo but when they start working on the nose I definitely am peeking through fingers. The sex is hot, and Christian is still gorgeous even if he is a jerk.

Not for young viewers! But definately not your mothers soap operas either. It's definately going to get a strong reaction one way or another.",1196208000,,1110,4.322115384615385

2022035,5,B0001O3YLM,"""Nip/Tuck"" (Season One)

These days in television, there seems to be more and more television shows dedicated and created for mature audiences only. Some people love ""The Sopranos"", ""The Shield"", ""The Wire"", ""Desperate Housewives"", ""Sex and the City"", etc... But for me, ""Nip/Tuck"" is the greatest television show ever created. I enjoy it much more than ""The Sopranos"" and just as much as I've enjoyed ""Oz"". This show is basically about the personal and professional lives of two male plastic surgeons who owns their own practice (McNamara/Troy) and reside in Miami, Florida. The show is intelligently written, attention-grabbing and very graphic in profanity, violence (including surgeries) and sexual content. And this television show is much better than over-rated shows such as ""ER"", ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""City of Angels"", etc...

Sean McNamara is a family man who is not only educated, but he's also very serious about his career, weak and sympathetic (in some instances). Sean McNamara has two children and a housewife names Julia, who put her career to the side due to the fact that she's had children. Sean's teenage son, Matt, is going through things that would make many parents hit the ceiling. Matt is engaging in sexual escapades, which includes porn stars, threesomes, drugs, car accidents, etc...

Christian Troy, on the other hand is handsome, educated, to-the point, very verbal, a womanizer, a brute, materialistic, unethical and underhanded. Christian Troy loves fast cars, women and loves to make people feel low every once in a while. Christian Troy is a single man who has countless sexual escapades with porn star Kimber (played by the beautiful Kelly Carlson) and a woman he met at a ""clinic"" for people who have sexual addictions. We also see how he becomes victimized by stalkers and ""haters"". We also get a glimpse of what his childhood was like in one dramatic episode about Catholic priests and pedophiles.

I also love this show because much of it is true. We live in a society today that is fueled by self-hatred, thanks to media images telling people how they ought to look and feel about themselves. There's a number of people who undergo surgery trying to lose weight (because they're to lazy to exercise), women who feel as if they need breast and butt implants to get a man's attention, etc... This show focuses not only on what plastic surgeons go through, but this show focuses on one of America's sicknesses.

This season of ""Nip/Tuck"" introduces you to the characters (and contains 13 episodes)... And just like every season of this show, this season shows both their professional and personal lives. However, you really don't get to know everyone until Season 2. Season 1 is a very excellent season of this show. However, Season 2 happens to be my favorite season. Season 2 is much more hype, twisted and graphic than Season 1. When Season 3 starts, that's when things start to slow down a bit. I won't give away any spoilers for those seasons right now. Just watch out for my review for every season of this show!

CAUTION: I will be the first to admit that this show is absolutely not recommended for everybody. This show is explicit and contains bold, sickening and graphic surgeries, constant profanity, strong sexual content, including dialogue and some brutal violent sequences. This show's sexual content makes the sex on ""The Sopranos"" look like ""Sesame Street"". The sex on this TV show is even more graphic than the sex on ""Sex & The City"". The show's rating is TVMA. This show is absolutely not for immature people, children or people who are sensitive to profanity, sex and violence.

My favorite episodes [8/13]:
1) Pilot -- The surgeons come face to face with a tough Hispanic gangster who's after a rival/client who happens to be a pedophile.
2) Nanette Babcock -- An hugely overweight woman wants plastic surgery to look good for a high school reunion, but fails to see that her expectations are unrealistic.
3) Sophia Lopez -- Sean confronts an old colleague who is notoriously known for malpractice. Christian tries to relate with Matt, but the two end up in temporary trouble.
4) Megan O'Hara -- Christian becomes the victim of a few stalkers and he comes face-to-face with them. Sean develops a relationship with a female patient with cancer.
5) Cliff Mantegna -- Matt is caught having a threesome by his mother. The parents of the three teenagers hold a conference which turns ugly.
6) Sophia Lopez Part II - Christian swaps his sexy ""girlfriend"" Kimber to another plastic surgeon for a Lamborghini, which results in Kimber ""torturing"" and leaving Christian.
7) Adelle Coffin - A very sad episode. Sean's relationship with female patient Megan O'Hara comes to a tragic end.
8) Escobar Gallardo - The season finale. Escobar Gallardo's constant pressure, threats and blackmails toward the two plastic surgeons comes to an end.

This DVD Boxed Set is filled with some very nice special features, including the music video for the catchy theme song. I appreciate the fact that there are deleted scenes for certain episodes, many of which are necessary. For me, I love to watch television shows and movies with English subtitles, although I speak English. I've watched a number of foreign films growing up, so I've grown accustomed to that. Besides, I like to read what people are saying in case I can't turn of the volume on my DVD player. This is extremely recommended!",1192320000,3,5424,4.933187294633078

At any point if you can imagine the most bizarre twisted turn the plot could take, you will pretty much get that twist plus something 5x as messed up that you could never think of.  Not to mention they keep 5-10 plot lines running at once, but at the same time they are great at bringing you up to speed at the beginning of the show.

2022079,5,B0001O3YLM,"I have just started renting this series, and have seen almost all the first season, and I so wanted to hate this series, because it is so symptomatic of a society, where people pursue perfection through plastic surgery rather than just learning to accept themselves as they are.

However, I am totally won over by the quality of the drama and the issues explored, and the sometimes searing dialogue.  This is a brilliant series, with two brilliant leads, and Joely Richardson.

As you look below the seemingly superficial surface, there is much that is dramatic and disturbing, and even profound that will intrigue and fascinate you.  It is totally engaging.

The two plastic surgeons are long term partners, with contrasting styles.  McNamara is the man of conscience, and compassion, and a family man.  Troy is a damaged amoral narcissist with a penchant for money, good things and gorgeous women. It is up to McNamara to supply his moral compass.  As you can imagine, this dynamic creates a much drama and conflict.

Joely Richardson plays McNamara's embittered angry wife, as they are struggling though the difficult part of marriage.  Murphy's Law is contantly at work here, ensuring that anything that can go wrong will go wrong often in surprising ways.

This is a fantastic series, which I am totally enjoying, and highly recommend.",1176163200,2,1340,4.990990990990991
2022080,5,B0001O3YLM,"""Nip/Tuck"" is one of the craziest, outrageous, most graphic, and fascinating shows I've seen. It is a story of two Miami based plastic surgeons and the drama of their friendship, careers, personal lives, and other social difficulties. From the first second, it is a wild ride - amazing pace, incredible situations, twists and turns, and it is very well done. I did not watch this show when it first started but my younger son is a huge fan and he always tells me how much I've been missing. Finally, he gave me the First season on DVDs for my birthday. I trust my son's taste in shows - because of his high recommendations I started to watch ""24"" and was completely blown away with its first season. Anyway, ""Nip/Tuck"" is very controversial, and its graphical surgeries moments are difficult to watch - do not watch it when you eat or right after your dinner - but it is entertaining, twisted, smart, and disturbing.

The creators of ""Nip/Tuck"" did a really great job on the show with truly interesting characters - no one is perfect, they all are flawed but compelling. The twists in plot are always unexpected, the visual effects -eye-popping and jaw dropping, the acting - first rate from everyone, and then, the episode 10 comes - the crazy mixture of surrealism, dark humor, and highest drama.

2022116,5,B0001O3YLM,"Okay, so I didn't watch Nip/Tuck from the beginning. But after seeing the season three finale, I was hooked. The following week, I placed the order for its first season. I don't usually purchase TV series boxed sets (aside from Friends and Grey's Anatomy), but Nip/Tuck failed to disappoint. It came a week earlier than it was supposed to and the packaging was flawless. I watched it all in one day, stopping only once to get a drink.

I have yet to have seen a show that presents itself as provocatively as Nip/Tuck and still maintain a sense of coolness. From the moralistic Sean McNamara to the promiscuous Christian Troy, I fell in love with the show's dark characters. It's over-the-top storylines and versatile acting pulls you in and doesn't let go.

After a week, I bought the season two of Nip/Tuck, which is equally commendable, if not more so. Forget about the strangeness of Lost or the wit of Grey's Anatomy. Nip/Tuck is the best TV show still running.

It is true, though, that Nip/Tuck tends to ""push the envelope"" when it comes to sexuality and violence. Though some, like the Parents Television Council, fail to see through the mature content of the show and see its ties to morality, ethics, and family bonds, the adult material makes the show stand out against the trivial programs that occupy our televisions today. Perhaps it is that content which makes Nip/Tuck the extraordinary show it is.

I highly recommend this product to anyone who can stand the sight of bloody surgeries and is not easily offended by the intense topics brought about by the show.",1164499200,5,1576,4.740875912408759
2022117,5,B0001O3YLM,"I can remember seeing promos for this show and thinking; ""Man this is going to be a joke"". It was my mother who convinced me to watch the series premier. Once the pilot was over, I was shocked. I couldn't believe how wonderful the acting was for a prime time TV show. The content was edgy and erotic, as was the language.

As I continued to watch the series, I saw Sean McNamara and Christian Troy develop and play off each other. Which is displayed by intrepid acting from Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon. Nip/Tuck would be Nip/Suck if it weren't for the chemistry between both the leads. The history, friendship, conflicts and brotherhood between Sean and Christian is what makes this show work.

The supporting cast is also stellar and gives the show a great element of drama. Robert LaSardo has been in every B movie I can think of, but his performances in these season (and cameos in season 2 & 4) are kick amazing!  Joely Richardson can also pull off one of the best American dialects.  The background music is also very fitting for the show, using modern and retro tunes. But the icing on the cake for this show is the writing of the different story lines. They manage to be separate and commingled all at once.

This DVD is awesome! It has all 13 episodes from the first season, deleted scenes, and gag reel, documentaries and other cool features. The picture and sound quality is great. The first season of the show is also good because it gives the viewer a great taste of the series and what it has to offer. I have heard many negative reviews about the following seasons, stating that they weren't as good. I disagree, if you like the characters and want the limits to be pushed, then you will love this show. However, if you are a person who doesn't have a taste for darkness, smut, black comedy and melodrama, please don't watch this show.

If I had my pick between this show and most movies in the theater, I would go with this show. It is more aimed at adults and deep thinkers, than some of that PG-13 crap you find in the Movie Theater today.",1161043200,6,2059,4.4338624338624335

The series are about the life of two of the best plastic surgeons in Miami, who underneath prefection and luxury hide secrets and drama. Sean McNamara played by Dylan Walsh has a partner, Christian troy (Julian McHahom) and even though he seems to have the perfect life. Being a successful surgeon including a wife and two kids, he's depressed and doesn't feel good about himself, his marriage is almost destroyed and his relationship with his partner isn't the best. On the other side there's Christian who happends to be the opposite. He's single, dates the best girls in Miami, lives life freshly and in a way he has the driving wheel of his clinic next to Sean. Everything goes fine for Christian and Sean at work until one day they have the visit of a undergrounded personage who is going to give them lots of problems. This is so serious that they even get one step from going bankruptcy. On the love field, while Sean is trying to safe his marriage, his wife and Christian have some encounters, Christian gets involved in problems with two girls...anyway it's impossible to even blink your eyes because everything goes from interesting to much more interesting while you go through other episodes.

The stories are very good, the actors are flawless, the speacial effects are one of the best from the series nowadays but the only defect about this show is that the locations are poor, the producers should've concentrated more on locations beacuse Christian's appartment and Sean's house aren't nice at all and you don't get to see anything from Miami because I even think that they shoot in Miami. It would've been great if they gave footages from Miami as they do on CSI Miami, buy well the episodes are so good that this goes to a second level.

This DVD edition includes some interesting speacial features including the making of 3 documentaries showing how cast and creators work, some deleted scenes, a music video from the theme ""A perfect lie"", subtitles in English, Sapanish and French among other special features.",1160611200,3,2220,4.746113989637306

2022131,5,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck is a shallow show that digs deep, it certainly got me hooked; and I don't watch TV.  I received Nip/Tuck Season One as an unwanted gift, and have been hooked on the show ever since.  Following the lines of a very adult soap opera revolving around a plastic surgery practice, Nip/Tuck saves itself from being ordinary with some truly phenomenal surgery FX and the best soundtrack since Michael Mann's 'Miami Vice'.  With the expert blending of visual and audio into a sensory treat, you immediately become attracted to the show.  Then, you will stick around for the gruesome surgery scenes and the $ex.  My friend said I would like the show because I am a horror fan (the realistic and bloody surgeries), and he was right.

The characters are irritatingly predictable and irritatingly unpredictable, if that makes sense.  Just when you think you have them figured out, they do something stupider than usual.  But with the excellent casting, the actors manage to pull off some pretty lame dialogue and keep the show not just interesting but compelling.

At McNamara/Troy, Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) are at odds with each other.  Together since med school, the two are completely separate personality types.  Sean is quiet, timid, and stuck in a rut in his marriage to Julia (Joely Richardson).  Christian is a narcissistic, womanizing, shallow, and carefree bachelor.  The super-talented Roma Maffia plays anesthesiologist Liz Cruz, always at odds with arrogant Christian.

In Season One, the character plots introduce us to Kimber Henry (played by model-beautiful Kelly Carlson) as one of Christian's conquests.  Kimber becomes part of the regular cast.  The clinic hires psychiatric consultant Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz).  The doctors find themselves involved chest deep with a vicious drug lord who begins to use their practice for smuggling heroin inside breast implants, Sean has to come to grips with a transsexual patient, and Julia fights off her desire to reunite with Christian after all these years. Matt McNamara (John Hensley), Sean and Julia's teenage son, gets high with a friend and runs down a young girl with their car.  The clinic's most notorious patient, Mrs. Grubman, receives free surgery for life because Sean leaves a cauterizing tip in her abdomen.  Matt wants Sean and Christian to operate on her though her religious mother refuses.  Dr. Bobolit's practice is running McNamara/Troy into the ground, and Christian trades Kimber for Bobolit's Lamborghini.  Christian's one night stand with witchy Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig) evolves into fatherhood, but there's a surprise in the delivery room.  Sean has an affair with a patient, and this is just skimming the surface of the plotlines.

My favorite character in Season One would have to be Escobar Gallardo, the brutal, tattooed drug lord who inadvertently teaches Sean how to get in touch with his violent, masculine side.  The ending of Season One is a great blow out episode with Escobar.

Some of the surgeries performed to tricked out music are face-lifts, boobjobs, liposuction, botox shots, and a hilarious scene where Sean's cadaver head during his board exam starts talking to him.

All said, Nip/Tuck is a slick, glitzy soap opera with bloody surgeries and very adult $exual themes.  Just what the doctor ordered.  Don't miss out on the extras either, which include a segment on how they achieved their realistic FX, and a funny outtakes clip called ""Severed Parts"".  Enjoy!",1157414400,,3517,5.142605633802817
2022132,5,B0001O3YLM,"I saw the first season on TV but missed a few episodes, so I bought the set. That's high, high praise. I was thrilled with the extra bonus features, which includes deleted scenes that make the episodes even better.

As much as I've enjoyed the succeeding two seasons, the first season is where these guys made their reputation and got their following. Even the very two-hour pilot episode, where they dispose of a corpse by feeding it to the Floridian alligators, is brilliant. Pilot episodes are usually clunky, as the cast and writers are settling into their parts. This is polished and beautiful.

As much as I like the acting, and I love the acting, the writing is what makes this series brilliant. Great actors need great material. Even a great actor can't rise above bad material. The dialogue is snappy and realistic. The plotlines are perfectly convoluted, like perfectly balanced mathematical equations.

That said, if you can't handle scenes of blood and surgery, this isn't for you. Or you should be forewarned to be ready to close your eyes as necessary.

I would recommend this show for a mature audience only.

It's salacious, graphic, almost unbearably human and filled with passion.  These doctors can adequately be described as living and working within the ""thousand shades of gray"" that exist between black and white.  The hypocrisy will drive you mad, the passion for life and career will inspire you, the eroticism will leave you speechless and you can search long and hard to find a boring moment only to discover, it just isn't there.

2022135,5,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck, a drama on FX about two plastic surgeons who run their own business, McNamara/Troy in the perfection-obsessed society of Miami, FL.  I love this show because it isn't just about the patients of McNamara/Troy but it also goes into the lives of the doctors.  The raunchy script mixed with the dramatic lives of the doctors and their patients makes for an excellent, interesting, well written show. While it definitely is NOT a show for children, it's a great show for young adults and middle-aged adults alike.  The compelling mixture of sex, drama, family and plastic surgery make this one of my favorite shows. I can't wait for the 4th season to start.",1151452800,,662,4.84070796460177
2022136,5,B0001O3YLM,"I heard about ""Nip/Tuck"" and since it was about plastic surgery, I avoided watching it.  I appreciate the importance of plastic surgery in restoring the looks of patients, but am less enthused by cosmetic surgery to improve personal appearance, mainly because I do not consider being pretty or handsome to be that important (being neither makes it an easy position to hold).  But more importantly I avoided taking biology in high school and college because I was not going to take a scalpel and start dissecting a frog (or worse).  I still remember the anti-smoking film I saw in health class and how everybody freaked during the lung cancer operation.  It was not taking out the diseased lung, but the bit where the surgeon cut into his chest that had everybody gagging.  But several students recommended the series and I decided to check it out.  Surprisingly I made it all the way to Episode 24, ""Natasha Charles,"" before I got to something that freaked me and had me yelling ""No!"" over and over again so loudly my wife came running because she thought something had happened to me (you will know it when you see it, and that is all I can say if I want to continue writing this review).

Of course the show is not really about plastic surgery, although in pretty much every episode there comes a point where we get to see it performed.  ""Nip/Tuck"" is about the people who require the surgery and the surgeons who perform it.  In Miami we find McNamara/Troy, a plastic surgery practice co-owned by Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and his best friend, Christian Troy (Julian McMahon).  Sean is married to his college sweetheart, Julia McNamara (Joely Richardson), and has two children, a teenage son named Matt (John Hensley) and a younger daughter named Annie (Kelsey Lynn Batelaan).  There is something of a love triangle between Sean, Christian, and Julia, but what is pivotal to the dynamic of the show are not the feelings that Christian and Julia have or still have for each other.  Central to the series is that fact that in the final analysis, Sean cares more for his best friend than he does for himself.  Beyond that it is painfully obvious that Sean and Christian are the sort of opposites that make for good partners: Christian has yet to find anybody he loves more than himself, and Sean will always put the welfare of others before his own.  These tragic flaws do not turn every episodes into a mini-Greek tragedy, but there are moments of pain.

The patients that come to McNamara/Troy are the catalyst for what happens, and if there is often a dramatic irony that exists between the problems of the patient and the ongoing personal traumas of the main characters, we should not be that surprised.  The initial question that patients are asked is ""Tell me what you don't like about yourself?""  The point of the question is about their appearance, but obvious the answer runs deeper than the person's skin.  It does not take long to establish that patients of all kinds come to McNamara/Troy for surgery.  So there are patients who need plastic surgery after a car accident (""Cara Fitzgerald"") and those who want it for cosmetic reasons, such as a pair of twins who want to look different from each other (""Mandi/Randi"").  Each episode is named for the primary patient, but you only know the titles from the menus.  This matters only on a few episodes where the title is for one of the main or supporting characters, in which case you know they are going to need medical attention by the end of the episode.

There are a couple of key story arcs throughout the first season, starting (and ending) with the drug lord Escobar Gallardo (Robert La Sardo), after Troy operates on somebody who wants to hide from Gallardo, who becomes more and more involved in their business, sending them mules from Columbia are smuggling drugs in breast implants.  Merril Bobolit (Joey Slotnick), a rival plastic surgeon, takes away business from McNamara/Troy by using advertising and other tricks, while Mrs. Grubman (Ruth Williamson) has developed an addiction to plastic surgery.  Meanwhile, somebody is vandalizing Troy's possessions, Sean becomes close with a patient (Julie Warner), and a transsexual named Sophia Lopez (Jonathan Del Arco) develops a friendship with Liz Cruz (Roma Maffia), the resident anesthesiologist.  Consequently, each episode has a self-contained story, but each is part of the larger picture and the image in the mirror is a constant reminder that looks are not everything.  If you can stomach the surgery scenes (including the do it yourself circumcision), then ""Nip/Tuck"" could get you hooked on its peculiar look at the human condition.",1145232000,3,4662,4.85479797979798
2022137,5,B0001O3YLM,"I don't watch television; I consider it a waste of time for the most part. However, one of my coworkers lent me the first season after I expressed an interest in plastic surgury.  Was I in for a suprise...I could not stop watching this series! The acting is incredible, the plot keeps twisting, and each of the charaters are so complex. I love that sometimes the characters are wise and sometimes they're misguided; no one is just a sinner or a saint. The issues the show deals with: body image, self hatred, aging, honesty and trust, are so compelling that I stayed up until 2:30am watching the DVDs! One thing: it's very racy (I was surprised that it's allowed on basic cable!), so if you're averse to sexy scenes, it might not be the series for you.

Even though there are some very hot and part explicits sex scenes, they don't get to the point of being obscene or porn, in fact it's very classy, this TV show.

I'de watched Nip/Tuck ads for almost a year a half and never really paid attention until a couple of weeks ago. After the season finale of 'Rescue Me'(another phenomenal show), I suddenly had nothing to fill the void. So, I decided to check out the show that filled that now vacant time spot. I watched my first episode of Nip/Tuck--- and the rest is history.

Season 1 is a truly beautiful demonstration of well written stories, intriguing characters, unexpected twists, and all in all---great drama. The characters are well acted and believable. The stories are complex, but not unrealistically ridiculous. The dialogue is truthful and heartfelt. And the visuals compliment the dynamic selection of diversly wonderful music the show brings with each new episode perfectly.

2022173,3,B0001O3YLM,"To follow up their success with The Shield, FX decided to commission another edgy, envelope pushing drama in Nip/Tuck.  Revolving around a Florida-based plastic surgery owned by Drs Sean McNamara and Christian Troy, the 13-part first season attempts to explore the professional and personal lives of these two very different men, and their long-standing friendship.

The series begins by introducing us to the two surgeons and their respective lives.  Sean is married to Julia, and has two children - Matt, a 16-year old, and his little sister Annie.  Sean and Julia's marriage is under strain from the outset, and this will be a focal arc of the inaugural season, as their lives unravel in a mire of infidelity (both physical and mental) and lies.  Swept up in this is Matt, who has various issues of his own to cope with as he approaches adulthood.  Christian, meanwhile, has no family but busies himself with notching up conquest after conquest.  It is adequately set up from the outset that these two men are flip sides of the same coin - Sean the seemingly dutiful family man, the intelligent one, the `talent' and Christian the flashy, seemingly soulless one, who has coasted by on his friend's laurels so far.

In this season, Julia and Sean will be forced to look into the dark heart of their marriage, and whether the last 16 years of their lives have been wasted on the wrong person.  Matt will deal with some very personal issues of his own as he comes to sexual maturity.  Some dark secrets from the past will rear up again for Julia, as she has to deal with the relationships between her and her husband and her and Christian.  Christian himself goes on a season long arc of self-discovery and admission as he comes to terms with a lot of the events from his youth that have made him the man he is.

So, is Nip/Tuck any good?  Yes and no.  What's the good?  Well, I can say without hesitation that the actors all do the very best with the material they're given to work with.  Especially good is Julian McMahon as Christian Troy.  What makes his performance stand out is that he is given a character that is essentially brutally unlikeable, self-centred, and almost without any redeeming features and he does some sterling work in getting an audience to identify and sympathise with Troy on even the most basic of that-shouldn't-happen-to-anyone level.  The production levels are very good - it looks fantastic - and despite many lagging episodes in the middle of the season things pick up greatly for a fine conclusion to the season.

What's the not so good?  Although the actors do their best with what they've got, the fact remains that the writers have pushed too hard and the series is left without even one really genuinely likeable or sympathetic character - without fail, the main characters are some of the most self-absorbed, destructive and unattractive people used as the focus of a drama.  Some may say that's the point - that these people who offer folks the chance to put `right' what they don't like about themselves physically are all ugly on the inside.  However, if you want to see genuinely complex and conflicted characters that frequently do the wrong thing, check out The Shield for a class in how it's done.  Most importantly, as the season came to a close, I still didn't actually care for any of the characters, and consequently none of the things that happened to them really evoke any emotional reaction.

Also, both of the major storylines that involve Matt stretch credulity to it's very limit and frustratingly, the storyline involving a girl badly injured due to Matt's actions is seemingly discarded without being properly resolved, although the repercussions of a character's actions would be devastating.  John Hensley does a good job as Matt but perhaps the reason he spends most of the season looking dazed and confused is that he knows what's coming next...

As well as this, although each episode involves a storyline about a patient, there is no real unifying arc to the middle section of the series and this lends it a feeling of listlessness and lack of direction that only amplifies the point that the series, despite it's proclamation that it is a `deep look at superficiality' really comes out at the end as a superficial look at superficiality and not half as `deep' as it thinks it is.  The lack of a strong mid-section to the series only serves to flag up the writers almost adolescent obsession with sex as a device to fill screen time, and this in turn shows up the inherent emptiness at the core of the series.

Having said all that, it IS still entertaining for the most part, and although almost instantly forgettable once the season concludes, fans of edgy and provocative drama will probably find something that grips them, even if only for a moment.  The central `romance' between Sean and Christian is probably the only positive as the season reaches its end - that these two vastly different men will never give up on each other is the only hopeful outcome in what is essentially a bleak outlook on human beings.

Overall, Nip/Tuck Season One is recommended for fans of adult drama, although perhaps best as a rental.",1131321600,6,5188,4.744988864142539

2022175,5,B0001O3YLM,"The stomach-turning episodes on the hot, new show Nip/Tuck are worth keeping your eyes open even for if the up-close-and-personal surgeries make you queasy.  The two doctors have personal affairs and business dilemmas that make the surgeries seem simple compared to their problems outside of the operating room.  The variety of problems that these doctors encounter top any list of problems that I would like to deal with, let alone knowing the life of the patient is in their hands.
The drama and suspense is killer.  Each episode is a must-watch and gives the same amount of heart-racing moments.
It is comparable to the feeling one has on a rollercoaster.  The clicking up the track to the biggest hill builds suspense and anxiety to know what happens next, as does the beginning of the episodes, when the doctors ask, ""What do you not like about yourself,"" and the plot thickens when real truths are revealed.  The affairs start to unravel and solutions are found - even if it means emptying their bank accounts.
This climax begins when the downfall starts on a rollercoaster and emotions scream out in relief.  There is always some drama brought on by an unexpected factor, whether it is a deep secret, an abundant amount of money, or a special find.  The show also throws in unanticipated curve balls, resembling the loops in a rollercoaster built in to make the ride more terrifying and sping-tingling.
The families and personal issues of the doctors come into play every episode and add to the problems.  For example, a new family forms for one doctor as the other's has marital difficulty.  Their personal affairs do not affect their surgeries, but their problems play a large part in formation of the scandalous episodes.
All the drama is exciting and exhilarating, just as rollercoasters would generate.  By watching the first episode, I was attached to the characters and felt for them.  I wanted discover what was over the next incline in the following episode directly after the last one, due to the unresolved problems and hair-raising, mind-boggling plastic surgeries done on patients, who needed more help psychologically than physically.  It is a must see and a must have in order to be able to follow the ups and downs of the new season, which is just as juicy.",1130889600,7,2280,4.863049095607235

Julia, Macnamara's wife is riveting in every episode..actually..every actor in this cast is perfect. If I could find something negative to say, I'd mention it..but this is a flawless production.

2022208,5,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck is the most compelling series produced in years.  Being TV-challenged myself, I hardly ever find anything that entertains me and engages my mind. Nip/Tuck has done it - and more. Highly HIGHLY recommended.",1126051200,3,214,5.294117647058823
2022209,2,B0001O3YLM,"Having rented the DVD for one week, as the proverbial guilty pleasure, we arranged ourselves comfortably in front of the TV and proceeded to watch the first four episodes in one sitting. However, the next day when it came to reinserting the discs for the remainder we looked at each other and reconsidered.  The discs were returned unwatched.  Life is too short.

*

The characters, in the end, were just not involving enough.  Julian MacMahon's Dr. Christian Troy is an extreme but oddly empty creation.  He is at his most engaging when he is being naughty, in a Benny Hill/Donald Trump kind of way.  His rather simplistic narcissism milks the same politically incorrect shocks time and again.  A cultural critic (preferably with a French or German surname) could well read this character, if not the show entire, as an interesting reflection upon the conflicting and layered attitudes towards sexuality that pervade American culture, but such an article would be of interest to the few, and read by the fewer.  Instead it might be more helpful to point out that Mr. MacMahon has spent many hours in the gym, that his mother was outrageously beautiful and that his father was a former Prime Minister of Australia, and that with such a pedigree he acquits himself marvellously well in the MTV-style sex scenes which grace this show with a disarming frequency.  His teeth are impeccably capped, his body hair neatly coiffured, and his acting technique a wonderful blend of Jean Paul Belmondo, Brad Dourif, and Marcello Mastroianni.  His flaws, however engaging, are quite cliched, and even after four episodes seemed doomed to a trite explanation at some future point, probably involving a revelation of childhood abuse, along with Angela Lansbury in a cameo as his mother, reprising her roles in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Gaslight"".

*

Dr. Sean McNamara has no eyebrows and no lips.  He also has no coherent personality, his actions and dialogue gaining in unpredictability what they lose in believability.  The price to be paid for this is that it becomes difficult to care about his character.  And this might well be said to be core problem with this show: the audience doesn't care about the characters.  Yes, if Dr. Troy died there would be no show, but if he were injured, that would be okay (although an ellipsis was necessary when his so-called virile member was incapacitated by botulinum toxin); if Dr. McNamara died, a replacement might be necessary; and if his wife, Julia, died, or the psychologist was fired, or the gerbil drowned...the impact would indeed be soft.

*

Reality TV has no doubt also softened the impact of the plastic surgery scenes, but they remain slighty more gory than the rucks and mauls in a Tri-Nations Rugby fixture.  ""CSI"" seems to tap into a similar fascination with corporeal mortality, choosing likewise to dress deep issues in the veneer of greusome physicality. Surgery (and possibly Rugby) appears to be the new pornography. The contrary might also be relevant, in that the gruesome is rendered trivial, so disguising the disturbing reality of our current (and the historical) world, where the most greusome acts are actually amongst the most serious.

*

""Nip/Tuck"" crowded the following issues into four episodes - the adult video industry, prostitution, lesbian sex, transexuality, the aesthetics of circumcision, cosmetic breast and buttock implants, penile enlargement, lap-dancing, a menage-a-trois involving twin teenage girls, attempted sodomy, pedophilia, along with some scattered observations relating to the ethics of practising medicine solely for financial gain.  I suppose that on balance the show could be said to be preoccupied with sexuality.  So too its predescesors in spirit, such as Sex in the City, L.A.Law and Hill Street Blues.  Part of the thrill of all these shows is the simple utterance of words and ideas previously  prohibited from the public domain.  Perhaps it is important that censorship is in fact relaxed, but endless instances of this relaxation seems less important and less interesting.  It is possible to become bored by Dr. Troy's next sexual outrage.  Frankly, that's one reason we did not bother with episode five, et al - the outrage was becoming boring.

After a couple years of friends telling me what a great show it was I finally took the plunge and decided to check it out.  I half to say I don't know what all the hype was about.  Yeah, it can be a fun, sexy show but some of the plots are boring and rather redundant -- even in the first season.  Granted, I can see why Julian McMahon became the breakout star of the show -- he's very good and has developed a wonderful character you love to hate.  Dylan Walsh and Joley Richardson's charcters, on the other hand, were very obnoxious.  In the end, I just din't see the point.  I'm not giving up, however.

2022239,5,B0001O3YLM,"I began watching this programme several months ago when the first season aired on Swiss French television. I cannot speak to the failings of dialogue that some others had mentioned, as it is dubbed in French for Swiss television, and some measure of quality is always lost in translation. That said, this show offers a great deal to compensate for any perceived weaknesses.

While it is often violent, and many of the surgical scenes border on the macabre, the series is visually stunning. The use of colour and lighting to enhance mood, the stark sets, which seem to suggest the emptiness of the characters' interior lives, even the careful selection of costumes befitting characters' personality and motivation, all work together to create a highly-engaging programme.

Thd cinematography is equally notable. The way the camera is panned around the scenes, especially when critical action is occuring, lends and almost 3-dimensional effect to the visuals. Furthermore, there is very little annoying, manic multiple-camera action during dialogue. Scenes appear to be deliberately staged to lend beauty and purpose to the characters' movements, as in an elaborate dance. In fact, no detail is missed. Even the music is well-chosen. I sometimes wonder if the sympathy or antipaty I feel for the characters isn't nurtured by thoughtfully placed songs designed to subtly elicit such emotion.

I would also like to say that I feel that this programme has been unfairly maligned with reference to its sexual content. While sex with multiple partners, masturbation and homosexual intimacy may be taboo for many in western society, they are facts of life and perfectly natural parts of the spectrum of human sexual behavior. To suggest otherwise is prudish at best and willfully ignorant in most cases. Furthermore, the acts depicted in Nip/Tuck are neither extremely explicit, nor purposeless or artlessly arranged. In fact, the characters' sexual exploits serve to humanize them in a way that very few other plot devices might have. Very few of us would have sympathy for a wealthy doctor whose vice was stealing from his less-well-off patients, but most of us can readily relate to irresponsible or misguided management of one's sex life and intimate affairs.",1116892800,4,2255,5.223756906077348

Characters are so rich and interesting that you get involved and get caught up in their lives from the very beginning.

Show is not however for everyone. It is very edgy, provocative, sexy and at times somewhat disgusting (watching plastic surgery in detail may not be everyone's idea of fun). But shows creators deserve recognition for pushing each episode that close to the line and never crossing it. It is perfectly executed. And another thing to mention is a soundtrack accompanying the show. It is just as good as the show itself. Unfortunately I missed few episodes of season 2 as well. Can not wait till its out on DVD.

2022246,4,B0001O3YLM,"Being a big fan of other dramatic series such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"", I was very intrigued by the premise of ""Nip/Tuck"". While not as brilliant as either series, it succeeds as an offbeat and quirky saga, and I found my time spent with this DVD set to be very satisfying indeed.

The earmark of a good series is when you start watching it, and then find that you cannot stop. ""Nip/Tuck"" is compelling for the right reasons. It presents characters that I care about, and it gives me a storyline that makes me care what happens next. The series follows the lives of two middle-aged, WASPY plastic surgeons and their adventures through surgery and their individual mid-life crises. The two surgeons are also polar opposites. Dylan Walsh plays Sean McNamara, a family man who wants to help people and genuinely make a difference through his work. His partner, Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), is the playboy who is more interested in sex and money than what his partner strives for. Their difference becomes a primer for the dramatic tension that brings the series to life, and the home lives of each character makes it even more rich a character drama. Similar to ""Six Feet Under"", each episode begins with a new character's own story. Instead of a death, it is a person looking to have plastic surgery done. This becomes the catalyst for what occurs throughout the episode, and it gives each episode a movie-like quality.

The show has excellent acting and writing, that goes without saying. The flaws will depend on the viewer's expectations. The surgery scenes add a grittiness that makes the show work, but it will definitely turn off the more squeamish viewers. They are extremely graphic, as are some of the events that occur to the surgeons (and other characters) throughout the first season. The only problem I found with the story was the over-reliance on soap opera cliches, such as ""it's your baby"", ""I had an affair"", and ""It's my right to die"". These do wear thin, but it doesn't make the series any less enjoyable.

I highly recommend this series to those who enjoy the offbeat and sometimes irreverent quirks of the HBO drama series. I have only seen the first season, so I cannot comment on the series as a whole, but this first season is one heck of a kick-off.",1111017600,,2291,4.708229426433915
2022247,5,B0001O3YLM,Nip/Tuck just finished airing here in Germany and I have to admit that I didn't think it could be any good. It was on the same time that Sex and the City used to be on and I just loved SATC and thought there couldn't be another show as good as that one. But how I was mistaken! Dylan Walsh (that I didn't know) and Julian McMahon (I knew him from Charmed and Profiler) did such a great job at the portrayal of the two plastic surgeons that it was a real pleasure watching them. Julian McMahon in particular I have to commend. He did such a great job that I absolutely disliked his character until that one episode where I have to admit I really felt sorry for Christian but it only lasted until the next episode where he traded his girlfriend for the Lamborghini!

Season 1 is worth seeing, but Season 2 is even better!  Many people missed Season 1 on TV, so obtaining this DVD box gives you the chance to see how it all started.

2022302,5,B0001O3YLM,"When I first saw the commercials for Nip/Tuck, I wasn't interested at all. Sure it looked cool because of the women and it looked like it had an edge, but it didn't thrill me all that much. Then I ended up catching the season finale from season one on TV with some friends. They were huge fans of the show. After that I saw the season premiere for season two, I have been hooked ever since. I would religiously watch season two each and every Tuesday night and I have recently purchased season one on DVD. I am quite happy I did.

Nip/Tuck is a very interesting show. Sure it has a lot of sex, good looking women, mature audiences kind of stuff....but, it also has an underlying message. Plastic surgery is not for everyone. At times, it can do more harm than good. And is even the concept of plastic surgery hurting our perceptions of what women are supposed to look like, and so on. Some people need it for real reasons like they got in a accident or something that was out of their control. Others just abuse it because they are rich and don't want to look older. You get a little bit of both in Nip/Tuck.

The story centers around two main characters, Shawn McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Christian Troy (Julian McMahon). They are plastic surgeons in Miami, FL. Shawn is the married family guy. While Christian has a different woman every night and sleeps around like crazy, Shawn is married to his wife Julia (Joley Richardson). They have one teenage son (John Hensley) and one daughter. It's actually hard to write a review about this show, because I don't want to give away any plot lines or anything. It's one of those shows that once you start watching it, you have to see what happens next week. I can't say that about a lot of TV shows these days, since reality TV is running rampant.

My best advice would be to check out the show on FX (the channel), see if you like it and then pick up season one on DVD. If you are anything like me and enjoy one-hour dramas, you will be done with the DVD set in maybe one day. It's that good.

Special Features: There are 3 documentaries and I liked all of them. There is a gag reel, which is actually quite funny. There is one deleted scene, a music video for the song ""A Perfect Lie"", and a teaser trailer. These are not bad supplements considering most DVD sets of TV shows don't give you squat.",1099180800,6,2343,4.342465753424658

The video is really nice and sharp. Colours are vibrant and I hardly found any grain in the picture. It's a really good transfer that is much better then the broadcast quality. The video is widescreen (1.78:1) .

Audio:

The track is mostly dialog coming from the center channel until the music kicks in, and the other speakers come alive. It sounds good for a Stereo Surround track.

Extra's:

Top of the line behind the scenes features and deleted scenes from several episodes plus a really great blooper reel and more. This makes the set even better.

Buffy is gone, as is Sex And The City, and of course, who could forget Friends? I thought I'd have nothing to watch on TV anymore, Will & Grace being my only saviour, but then along came Nip/Tuck in August 2004. Originally broadcast on cable in the UK, the show was sold to Channel 4 and advertised as the next big thing. With commercials for this hip, sexy and stylish new drama every half an hour, there can't be one single person who watches Channel 4 who doesn't know about it. The ratings show this: Nip/Tuck has gone on to become a massive ratings hit in the past two months that it has been on air, and I for one am completely sold.

Let me first say that Nip/Tuck is definitely not a show for everyone. It contains many scenes of medical gore and explicit sex scenes, along with strong language and distressing moments of human revelation. I'm not deterred by these factors, but sometimes I have to look away during the medical scenes. Basically, the show revolves around the two lead characters, Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) who own a blossoming plastic surgeon practice in Miami South Beach. They are lifetime friends, but are rather different in character - Dr. Troy is a single, middle-aged, sex-maniac who is commitment-phobic. This is partly due to childhood experiences, yet one cannot feel total sympathy for his manipulative and devious ways. He is very sexy and woman can't resist him. Dr. McNamara is the sensible family-man, happily married to Julia (Joely Richardson) and the adoring father of two children, Matt (John Hensley) being the son.

The two doctors are both each going through a full-blown mid-life crises, involving their families, patients and each other. Season 1 perfectly captures this. What makes the show so unique for me is the successful blend of humour and drama. They are at times funny, and at times disturbingly powerful in their drama. The storylines are cutting-edge and very sharp to the times. The perception of society in this show is acute and precisely executed: it shows society for what it is, and presents the dangers of the need for perfection, without shoving it down the viewer's throat. The storylines are cutting-edge because a show like this has never been around - it is only the advances in modern technology and the ever-growing popularity of plastic surgery that a show like this has been made possible. Therefore a whole world of new storylines has been opened for exploration, and when you attach this with good old-fashioned human emotion, you get a fantastic blend of ground-breaking new territory to explore.

The show's main stars give the best performances. Julian McMahon and Dylan Walsh are the backbone if the entire show, but for me it is the superb Joely Richardson who steals the show. Her emotional-intensity is on fire, the woman can REALLY act! Valerie Cruz stars as Grace Santiago, the sickenly-gorgeous psychologist who must analyse the mental-state of patients before they undergo surgery. Roma Maffia stars as the loveable lesbian Liz Cruz, who is the two surgeon's anaesthesiologist. The storylines involving all these characters are incredibly complex, but all the threads of their characters are tied-up towards the end of the season. Sort of.

There are so many characters in the first season that make this show so appealing, but the particular stand-outs include the desperate model-to-be Kimberly who will do anything to achieve her goal of perfection and acceptance. Her revenge on Christian is brilliant. The short but memorable role of overweight Nanette Babcock are heart-breaking in their honesty, whilst the young transsexual Sofia Lopez opens up her whole world to the viewer and how difficult it is just being accepted as she is. Most people come to the two doctors for petty things such as boob enhancements, and when contrasted with the emotional need to feel content as a transsexual, the reality of life is put into perspective. Megan O'Hara is a patient that Dr. McNamara becomes most emotionally-attached to, and even goes as far as to have an affair with, risking his entire family. This might seem devious, but their relationship is beautiful: she's a cancer-patient in need of love and affection and has only a short time left to live. Her suicide scene is heart-breaking. I was completely transfixed.

The high-emotion continues with Cara Fitzgerald, who is knocked down by Matt McNamara and a friend in a car. Her strong-Christian mother refuses plastic surgery to reshape her unrecognisable daughter's face, but eventually has to give in. The multiple-personality of Montana/Sassy/Justicy is another highlight for its emotional intensity and brave tackling of such a sensitive topic. The last two episodes are dominated by the evil Escobar Gallardo who made his presence in the first episode, but returns to use the doctor's darkest secrets as blackmail, forcing them to remove the liquid-heroin implants of Escobar's curvaceous drug-couriers.

There are too many brilliant scenes to talk of in just one review of Nip/Tuck Season 1, but trust me when I say that this show really is one of the best to come along in recent years. The only concern is that sometimes the dialogue is a little cheesy or inappropriate for the scene's level of intensity, but this is just a minor quibble from such a promising and popular show. I look very much forward to seeing Season 2 of thie show, which will be broadcast sometime next year. While I wait, I'm sure my box set of Season 1 will console me with repeat viewings of this disturbingly perfect drama.",1097884800,21,5723,4.950052029136316

2022307,4,B0001O3YLM,"With the shocking sucess of The Shield, FX began turning out some all new original programing, and Nip/Tuck is one of the better shows to come from the cable network.  Revolving around the sordid lives of two, hot shot Miami plastic surgeons: the married with children Sean (Dylan Walsh) and the womanizing and possibly sex-addicted Christian (Julian McMahon).  Both of whom are good at their jobs, and despite being longtime friends, are in many ways polar opposites of each other.  Sean's wife Julia (Joely Richardson) has dilemmas of her own as well, but none as dire as when the two surgeons find themselves reluctantly employed, and under the gun, by a Latino druglord named Escobar.  Nip/Tuck's mix of realisticly graphic surgery scenes and equally graphic sex make the show compulsively addictive viewing; despite the fact that it's a little rough around the edges in some spots.  The two male leads are perfectly cast, and even though everything may seem to be wrapped up by the last episode's end, the currently running season two proves things are far from being ok.  All in all, Nip/Tuck is definitely one of the best original shows on cable TV, but be warned that it is not for the squeamish.",1095724800,6,1204,4.848780487804878
2022345,5,B0001O3YLM,"This show is great. The acting is uniformly excellent. (The practice psych, Ms. Cruz, is sickeningly beautiful.) Frankly, while Six Feet Under has started to run out of gas, having turned most of its characters into overcooked zombies, this show seems to be able to get the temperature in the furnace where it needs to be every episode. There are some simple reasons for this. One is that this show isn't stuffed full of fantasy and dream sequences (like SFU, for example). Another is that the core of this show is much stronger than that of SFU. Whereas many shows play gumby with their characters until there is nothing left, this show works on core situations and does so extremely well. Sometimes it's a meditation on the inability to keep things in balance without massive amounts of denial, often it tackles basic elements of relationships powerfully. Ultimately, the edge this show has is that it doesn't cop out and recede into cliche as so many other shows do.

All that said, this doesn't come out completely nickless. For example, the first season was incredibly strong, but the last scene of the finale was insanely stupid, followed by a shot of the stars mooning the camera.... unbelievably cheap and dumb. And this season, the episode in which they had to separate the siamese twins was pretty silly, given the metaphorical transparency. The real fear though is that the writers will go overboard and this thing will jump the shark, as it were, by piling up the trials on these characters until it becomes the story of Job (fate of most serials), like Nate on SFU, leading to just bloodless boredom. Anyway, this disc set is awesome and a great deal: $40 for 5 of them.",1094342400,5,1683,4.724489795918367
2022346,4,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck is a series that pushes the limits of what is normally construed as ""edgy television"". The series, one of the highest rated on cable television, plays like one you might see on HBO or Showtime with the poignant drama, sharp humor, and racy content to match. Much has been made of the show's surgery scenes, but, they only account for about one scene per show and are almost never over the top gruesome. A more contoversial subject would be the almost gratuitous use of the ""S"" word, and the love scenes, which at some times seem to be inspired by cinemax. This is not your father's TV Drama, but it's prime time television at its best and most addictive.

2022347,5,B0001O3YLM,"""Nip/Tuck,"" which I've become addicted to since I bought these DVDs, is a knock-down-drag-out great and twisted show. It's very well-acted and completely compelling, featuring soap opera style twists that you won't see coming at all and beautiful people made that way through bizarre and disgusting plastic surgery scenes.

McNamara/Troy is an extremely successful plastic surgery partnership in Miami, thanks to the combination of talented surgeon Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and the hot and charming Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), who have been friends since medical school. The initial conflicts in the show come from Sean's midlife crisis, which allows him both to sleepwalk through his troubled marriage to manic Julia (Joely Richardson) and leads him to think that his work is unimportant. Christian, in the meantime, continues to seduce women without care while harboring some deeply-rooted personal demons.

One particularly corrupt surgery that ends REALLY badly for both the patient and the doctors, though, changes the whole set-up. Suddenly, McNamara/Troy is in all sorts of trouble with the Mafia and the police, and they've got a new psychiatric consult, Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz), on duty to help them better screen their patients before they go under the knife.

That, of course, leads to more drama, and the McNamaras' troubled son Matt and Julia's trip back to med school adds even more.

The show is occasionally, based upon its subject matter, morally vague, dirty, dark and villainous. It's also so delicious to watch that it never ceases, throughout its first season, to be anything short of fascinating. Sometimes you can't believe that you love these characters, in spite of some of the horrible things they're capable of doing to each other and to anyone in their path, but the top-notch acting of ""Nip/Tuck"" leads you to care for them, no matter what they've done.

Since buying these DVDs, I've been watching the second season on FX almost religiously. It's a great, great show.",1093132800,,2011,5.232919254658385
2022348,4,B0001O3YLM,"For a network TV show, ""Nip/Tuck"" is pretty damn good. What better place is there to explore moral ambiguity, sexuality, American values and good old-fashioned mid-life crises than a plastic surgeon's office? ""Nip/Tuck"" is often blatantly, even unnecessarily, titillating, but just when you think the show is in danger to catering to the lowest common denominator, it all of a sudden hits you with something profound. It also helps that the show's leads are all excellent: Dylan Walsh is great as the neurotic Shawn, Joely Richardson is wonderful as the tortured Julia and Julian McMahon is terrific (as well as smokin' hot) as the vain, self-indulgent Christian. I also enjoy Roma Maffia's supporting role as Sean and Christian's tentative surgeon's nurse. My only complaint is with the casting of Sean and Julia's son Matt ... the actor is too old to be playing a sixteen year old.

""Nip/Tuck"" is almost good enough to be considered in the same league as HBO's outstanding ""The Sopranos"" or ""Six Feet Under"" series. And maybe, just maybe, if the series continues to get better, it just might reach that level.",1092873600,,1111,4.973118279569892

2022350,5,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck certainly fits the bill for the title of adult cutting edge cable t.v. programming/entertainment or pushing the envelope status (I have been hooked since episode 1)...I don't need to go into all the descriptive details as to what I'm referring to as other reviewers or viewers have stated and witnessed just how provocative this series is ! A play by play run down of each episode is not necessary. Just a series about two top plastic surgeons running a clinic together (best friends since college) and their adventures with business, pleasure and personal matters.  It's titillating, thought provoking, and definitely mind blowing at times. It's steamy, not just in it's writing and display of eye opening sexual situations , but the dramatic issues of career, family and life these characters face. No matter how bizarre these situations get on the show, there is plenty of razor -sharp repartee (no pun) intermixed with caustic dialogue (sometimes the caustic is quite comical---other times, it's just sarcasm). Plenty of incredible and riveting performances by it's actors. The plot always thickens and twists and turns with each episode !Just when you think it's central characters couldn't get into worse predicaments, BANG !

Dr. Shaun McNamara is the more sensitive and down to earth devoted family man with the pleasant and likeable disposition and comforting bedside manner. Dr. Christian Troy is the hedonistic, arrogant, and sexually compulsive swinging bachelor who goes through one night stands and fast cars as he does surgical gloves (use 'em and lose 'em).Yet, as diverse as these two characters' personas are their friendship and their chemistry work. What is amazing as this series has progressed is how Shaun and Christian sometimes are not that different in certain aspects (last year's season found the married/family man Dr. McNamara having an affair with a dying woman). Then, in a recent episode of the second season Dr. Troy wanted to raise a child he once believed was his biological baby (until the actual birth proves otherwise that he is not the father)... Very gripping and emotional moments for both characters !

Sometimes I catch myself doing a double take on how Dr. Christian Troy speaks of women in general and their anatomy, or his anatomy...If this is offensive to some viewers I can understand why they would switch channels. BUT, you have to admit, because of the excellent writing and the wanting to know what's -gonna- happen -next factor, one becomes glued to the set! Nip/Tuck has that incredible WOW ! factor that is rare to find in tv/cable programming these days for an after prime time drama series. However, it is not all drama. It has it's share of bizarre comical moments. Also, each patient case the doctors deal with are not all laced with psychological or insecurity/vanity problems. Some of the situations deal with people who really need reconstructive surgery due to illness,accident,violence, or other disastrous disfiguring mishaps. The surgeries themselves prove that the Nip/Tuck special effects department and personnel have really done their homework and job to create or re-create some startling and realistic surgical scenes not for the squeamish viewer.

This is absolutely not for young viewers. This is a mature audience's(mom and dad's) tv viewing time before turning in...Almost forgot to mention that the gamut of guest star actors that appear in various episodes are top notch(Vanessa Redgrave, Jill Clayburgh,Femke Jansen) and can see why they probably jump at the chance to play their roles no matter how small or big the part !",1091664000,2,3612,5.148211243611584

 Nip/Tuck is one of my most pleasant surprises. This show is really good, has an excellent cast and great story arcs. The two lead actors really blow me away on a regular basis - just awesome. I like this show much better than the acclaimed ""Six Feet Under"" since I think the pacing is a little faster (without the show being shallow).

 What surprised me the most is that I don't have a problem watching the operation scenes! I'm a person who normally doesn't like to look at footage like this, and most of the time I close my eyes on CSI when the take the camera inside the human body for the ""CSI shots"". However I don't have any problems here!

2022369,5,B0001O3YLM,"Wow did I love this series! I missed it during the original broadcast, but based on what people have told me, I gambled on this box set. I feel like I hit the jackpot.

It's definitely not for everyone though. No sirree.

First of all, if you're squeamish, the brilliantly reproduced surgeries can be a bit nauseating. (I'm a surgeon, and I loved 'em. My wife, an ex-nurse, had to close her eyes...)
Second, if you are at all uncomfortable with the topic of sex, stay away. This series will plant you into situations you have not even imagined. Bouncing between hilarity and discomfort, sex is definitely a theme throughout the 13 shows.

Third, if you appreciate good acting, it does not get any better than this. Seriously. This is ""Sopranos"" good; ""NYPD Blue"" good. The two lead performances are pitch-perfect, both deeply flawed and often morally reprehensible individuals who at the end of the day, you can't help but root for. The ""supporting"" players are a heck lot more than that, and provide tons of drama, amusement and eye candy.
There is beauty and ugliness everywhere, from an absolutely gorgeous female figure to a purely evil drug dealing psychopath. That's just in one episode.

Fourth, the screenwriting is bling-bling eye-popping, smart as all hell and consistently surprising. The thirteen episodes link nicely together, the first ones dovetailing back into the last ones. I was constantly taken aback at the twists, the lines, the situations they came up with. Let's just say that I learned in the very first episode that crocodiles prefer ham to human flesh. And that fact is actually  important to the story...

I haven't even had a chance to go through what appears to be fairly extensive supplements and deleted scenes. I HAD to write in...I will recommend this to ANYONE, anyone over 18 I should say, who likes good television and may like to be pleasantly shocked from time to time.

With great restraint I have withheld many (if not all) plot points, because the exhilarating thrill of discovering them on your own is something you'll only feel once. Without spoiling too much, the show centers on the Miami plastic surgery practice of McNamara/Troy.
Sean McNamara is a questionably happily married man, with one teenage son, and one grade schooler daughter.
Julia, the wife, is plagued by doubts surrounding her love for her husband, the urge to go back to medical school and sexual attractions/distractions galore.
One of whom might be Christian Troy, Sean's best friend and partner, and one of the most gleefully decadent characters in TV history. I mean ""decadent"" in a good way. Sort of.
His travails include, but in no way are limited to, a continuing parade of sexual partners, a number of hysterical surgical propositions, problems involving his boat, his cars, his apartment and the plastic surgery competition across town.
Other important characters include the melting hot staff psychologist and the defiant, embittered, proudly lesbian anesthesiologist. The cast has such chemistry that they not only react to one another, they generate this bubbly heat together...it's fun to watch them prod each other to new heights.

The one thing that struck me the most about these shows is the amount of genuine heart that stands at the center of each episode. There is a large amount of provocative, politically incorrect but unassailable truth here...nothing you'd like to admit, but stuff you instantly recognize. As you get to know these characters, establshing empathy for them is easy. It's darn near irresistible. I was hooked from the first five minutes.

I could write more, but I need to go check out the extras, AND the four NEW episodes I have on tape. I have just GOT to get my Tivo hooked up...",1089676800,220,3737,4.92845786963434

You can really get a sense of what someone may go through when they feel the need to seek out a plastic surgeon's help.

Sean's marriage to his wife Julia(Joely Richardson)is on the rocks and he has trouble connecting with his teenage son Matt(John Hensley)which causes Sean to begin going through a mid-life crisis. Christian is a ladies man who has seemingly slept with half of the women in Florida. His ""love them then leave them"" lifestyle often gets him into trouble. Christian also lacks ethics, drinks too much, and is willing to operate on just about anyone to keep the money rolling in. Each episode of Nip/Tuck deals with a particular patient that Sean and Christian are operating on, along with everything that is going on in their personal lives as well.
When I first heard about Nip/Tuck I was highly skeptical because a show that is based on plastic surgery does not sound all that entertaining. However, if there was ever a time to apply the rule of ""never judge a book by its cover"" it is with this show.  Even though the effects of the sugeries themselves are groundbreaking and extremely graphic, there is only about 10-15 minutes of actual plastic surgery in each episode. What makes Nip/Tuck such a great show, is the fact that the storytelling and episode quality is so good that it is almost unreal. While the patients that Sean and Christian operate on differ from episode to episode, the overall story of what is happening in their personal lives manages to continue and build throughout the season. For a show that is supposed to deal with something as superficial as plastic surgery, Nip/Tuck has incredible depth to it. Actors Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon seem like they were made for the show, and manage to bring Sean and Christian to life with their amazing performances. Nip/Tuck is also as addictive as any show I have ever seen. Each episode you are hooked from the time you hear the show's wonderful catch phrase ""tell me what you don't like about yourself"" to the end credits. Last but not least, is the wonderful music that the show features. You get everything from songs of the 80's to current hit music. The soundtrack is definately one worth owning.
Overall, Nip/Tuck is definately one of the best shows on television today. You get everything from great performances and wonderful music, to amazing special effects and top notch storytelling. I was extremely happy when the first season of the show came to DVD. Not only do you get all thirteen episodes commercial free, but wonderful bonus features as well.

2022373,4,B0001O3YLM,"There's a key scene in the pilot episode of ""Nip/Tuck"" in which a vain, gorgeous blonde model asks (the equally vain and gorgeous) Dr. Troy what he thinks she needs surgery-wise to be a ""10.""
So Troy pulls out a marker and proceeds to bluntly detail every one of her flaws from head to foot on her naked body -- what he would lift, or change, remove, or cut. He then turns her marked-up self toward the mirror to confront what she had thought was so perfect only moments before. It's a shattering scene.
Which is why ""Nip/Tuck"" is so good.  The show is a wonderful paradox because it's all about facades -- while presenting a gorgeous facade itself. But there's always something else beneath the surface.  It's everything a cable drama should be -- and everything network TV these days pretty much can't be.  It's brutal (the surgeries are not for the weak of stomach and are often startlingly real), witty (the dialogue is quick, biting, and bracing), complex, and sexy as anything to boot.
The show (especially on DVD) looks fantastic, with beautiful production values, great music, film-quality cinematography, and superb acting.  It's slick and glossy and shiny and gorgeous -- and then it promptly looks underneath at all the insecurity and ugliness.  All these people want perfection, but let's face it, how often do we get it?
The two doctors are the backbone of the show, and the actors who bring them to life are incredible.  Dylan Walsh is wonderful -- I'd never been a fan of his before, but his boy-scout boyishness is used perfectly in this, and his acting chops blew me away. The guy can act.
And Julian McMahon is a revelation as Troy -- it's the role of a lifetime, and McMahon seems to visibly revel in his character's scheming, conniving, smugness, and superficiality -- he's almost a sociopath, and McMahon brings something almost reptilian and flat to his eyes in some scenes.  And then just when you least expect it, he'll give you a glimpse of something almost heroic underneath. The guy is simply not easily defined, as conflicted and dangerous as he is beautiful.
The women of the show are just as good, especially Joely Richardson, who is fantastic and almost Shakespearan as Walsh's bitter, conflicted wife.  I love Roma Downey as the smart and streetwise nurse of the practice, as well as Julie Warner, who is very good in a lovely and key role as a cancer survivor.
The entire first season of ""Nip/Tuck"" is excellent and worth seeing, and while there are several enjoyable standalone episodes, the season-long arc of this show is particularly strong, with every character facing, defeating, or falling before some kind of inner demon before the end.
WARNING: The show is definitely adult, and potentially shocking for many.  The surgeries are often graphically depicted, as are many sexual scenarios (most involving a naked or semi-naked McMahon, not that I'm complaining, LOL).
While made for F/X, the show is really best viewed along the same lines as an HBO or Showtime show -- the levels of violence and nudity are pretty similar. (But in the show's defense, it's very creative about this stuff, and everything often has a deeper meaning -- the sex is hysterically funny, or revealing, or poignant, depending on the episode.)
So if you're open to something exhilarating and new -- a medical drama unlike anything else out there -- ""Nip/Tuck"" is rewarding and truly a don't-miss. Especially with so much mediocrity on TV right now.
(Note: I removed one star because for some inexplicable reason this DVD set doesn't boast a single commentary -- unthinkable for a show as deep and multifaceted as this one. I hope they correct this in Season 2 -- a real shame.)",1088467200,,3691,4.8

I must say that this show has everything. The plot is interesting and you are never bored or thinking when will this end. The characters are well developed and they all grow throughout the course of the season. If you want a great and very entertaining show that will never bore you then this is for you. However, if you like things to be very realistic and accurate I would stay away from this. That is not to say that it isn't accurate, but some people may find it a bit over the top. GOT BUY IT NOW IT IS AWSOME!!!! WELL WORTH THE 60 BUCKS!!!",1088208000,,717,3.8513513513513513
2022376,5,B0001O3YLM,"This is another of Cable's truly enjoyable television shows that pushes the boundry where Network TV doesn't have the stomach too and it's result is a wonderful show. Getting the DVD with all of the extra cutting floor scenes is a great buy. You can watch the shows back to back with no commercials.
The Shield is a great look at a Cops life in a hostile enviroment and it is a one of a kind show. The Soprano's is a top notch look at life in a Mob Family. And Nip/Tuck now joins these other two superb dramas as a look at how superficial people can be and the cost one is willing to put themselves through to look ""perfect"". The acting is top notch, the writing is great, and the directing and camara work is much better than anything the big three have. I recommend this DVD set highly.",1087948800,7,788,4.225165562913907

2022401,5,B0001O3YLM,"This show has beautiful people in impossible situations with very slick dialog...
  If you want ugly people in boring situations who talk normally why are you watching TV? Go live your life!
  This is the most massively entertaining show/movie/anything i've ever seen.
  It has violence, blood, and sexuality. However, even if you don't like that stuff, you'll be happy to know that the morally depraved characters,while abundant, rarely come out on top and all the characters are very real and complex if not neccesarily likeable. It has funny moments and sappy moments and serious moments and lots of irony.
You should buy it!",1087776000,4,628,5.048543689320389
2022402,5,B0001O3YLM,"I found Nip/Tuck dvd to be a great asset. It has excitment added with emotion. All the special features were cool, but what I appreciated watching was the season. Even already watching the whole season on Fox I still love it. It has passion, romance, friendship and all that good stuff. I really advise anyone into passionate, yet graphic tv shows then this show is for you.",1087689600,,374,4.597014925373134
2022403,4,B0001O3YLM,Nip/Tuck is fearless. Great acting and storylines too. The first show I havn't been bored with in a long time. Its sexually and visually tantilizing. Well worth the $40!,1087603200,3,169,4.862068965517241
2022404,5,B0001O3YLM,"Putting all morals aside, this show is funny, serious, and sexy. I look forward to the new series beginning in June. This show has great actors/actresses,  I could watch it over and over !
I love it !",1087516800,,200,4.2631578947368425
2022405,4,B0001O3YLM,I just plain like the show. As stupid as it can get and cheezy as it can get with the obvious speeded up film of a car moving to make it look like it's not going 30 mph. That stuff really bothers me.,1087516800,,199,3.6511627906976742
2022406,4,B0001O3YLM,"I'm as addicted to this show as certain celebrities are to plastic surgery. Why? Is it the goofy catch-phrase? ""So tell me what you don't like about yourself."" Is it the all the money? The babes? The realistic slicing up of body parts during surgery? I am glad the whole first season is collected in this CD collection. I am even more glad the last show tied up some loose ends to ongoing plots throughout these thirteen episodes-but left a few wide open for next season. Nip/Tuck is full of interesting characters:
Dr. Sean McNamara--The ""talented"" surgeon. Will his mid-life crisis kill his marriage and his relationship with his children?
Dr. Christian Troy-The badboy surgeon. His questionable choices cause havoc with the practice right from the first scene of the pilot. Not only does this character steal the hearts of beautiful women, he steals the scenes in every episode.
Julia McNamara-After killing her daughter's gerbil, she decides to take control of her life, so she goes back to school. Does she have the potential to be a doctor? Is she a nutcase waiting to explode? Does she love Sean, her robotic husband, or not?
Matt McNamara-Just whose son is he anyway? Is he just a horny teenager or does his obsession with sex indicate he is actually the biological son of Dr. Troy? Or did he inherit his brooding manner from the emotionally unavailable Dr. McNamara?
Liz Cruz-This anesthesiologist for the doctors has a heart of gold and isn't afraid to put the boys in their place.
Escobar Gallardo-This drug lord is the main villain in the doctors' gallery of rogues. He is delightfully obnoxious and deadly.
Irony is a plot device that pops up over and over in each episode. The plastic surgeons have built their careers fixing up the exterior bodies of their clients, but let their inner psyches fall to pieces. Yes, being a plastic surgeon is a hip and sexy career, but I doubt it's actually this dramatic. That's why this show is addictive: no matter how bad things get, watching this show makes you realize you're not such a screw up after all.",1087516800,19,2060,4.756983240223463
2022407,5,B0001O3YLM,"Who could ask for more? Throw in sex, violence, action, gore, and some drama for the ladies and you got yourself one of the best shows on pay cable. The only other show that compares to Nip/Tuck is The Shield.
The main thing that turns people off from this show is the graphic surgery shown on the show. Since most people(wimps) can't stand the sight of blood, they can't get past the first few minutes of the show to get into the drama and story.
If you like The Shield give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1087516800,,522,4.282828282828283

2022409,2,B0001O3YLM,"this show is very bazzar, and very strange, i cant believe they actually made a show and got the budget for it, one of the first episodes in the first season, a lady who was a man previously, had her Dr put cocaine in her breast so she could return back to columbia so she can get some drug money.
This season set is deffinatly not worth its value, it should be in the 20$ range if you do decide to buy, those of you who do buy it, i hope you enjoy it",1087516800,3,451,3.8085106382978724
2022410,5,B0001O3YLM,"you will find the portrayal of six out of the seven deadly sins (lust, pride, greed, envy, wrath, and gluttony) but in such a beautiful setting and with such suave finesse, that it is absolutely incredible.  it is everything inappropriate one usually doesn't see on TV, and yet it is so addictive.  for my taste, it is not on par with the sopranos insomuch as the emmy-caliber actors, but believe me, the show is very fast-paced and always completely entertaining, and the eye-candy makes it well worth watching.  i cannot wait for the second season.",1087344000,,550,4.768421052631579

8015568,2,B0001O3YLM,"Nip/Tuck, a TV series where I watched the first season and almost all of the second, and sorry folks but that's where I get off the train.
Issue for me is the story is obviously contrived to make the most outrageous, ridiculous thing out of every situation and reduces pretty much all it's characters into one dimensional cut-outs.
I'm hoping that they introduce the concept of character development in later seasons as this show has a lot of fans, but for me to little to late.
The teenaged kid's first sexual experience is like something out of a penthouse letter and then I'm suppose to swallow the fact that a hottie like Famke Janssen would be interested in a man/boy instead of a rich man her own age.
This kid could die now and have a better life then most.
It doesn't end there folks, we got a plant watering service that send beautiful girls to bend over wearing super short shorts while working, so it's pretty much a fact that she will be banging Julian McMahon in an office quickie... because all good looking people have sex ALL the time, everywhere.
Even Julian and Grace, the therapist that cannot stand him, end up together,(predictably) and then she's gone, when the show had no more uses for her.
Listen, I can appreciate having to come up with plot points that are interesting, but these come off so contrived they might as well of come off an assembly line instead of having a nice organic feel to the story line.
However, if you like soap operas.....",1493942400,,1471,4.554716981132075
