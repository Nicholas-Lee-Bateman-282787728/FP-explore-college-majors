4135055,3,B003L1U3WK,"""Pros:
1. I learned several good tips for posing.
2. He cover several occasions

Cons:
1. The DVD could be better ""IF"", there was technical information on camera set up for exposure.
2. The DVD could be better ""IF"", it shows how to take good pictures of a group of people that are not families (schools, workers, sports, etc)

Do I recommend it: Yes, for beginners who want learn about working with the subject (with people and not how to use the camera with them)

I will give it 3 1/2 stars but Amazon review system won't let me do it""",1280966400,,537,4.297029702970297

It sure did help me in shooting a family, thanks to the CD I look, not only like I knew what I was doing but I looked professional.",1277337600,2,328,4.140625

If you are looking for information on lighting and light positioning, this is not the DVD to buy. Overall, I would rate it as ""okay.""",1368576000,,305,4.666666666666667
8399307,5,B003L1U3WK,"Manny you did it again. Posing with attitude definetly got me back into the swing of things for my portrait photography.
Not only is it great for beginners but also a great refresher course. I used to be a pro back in the 80's, then got out for many years,
now being out of work I'm resorting back to my love of photography and going pro again. Seeing Manny's DVD tutorials, that got me back on track
real quick. Gear Job Manny!! Get more out there.

Unlike his landscape video, which I downgraded because it was in black and white, this video is not diminished by its lack of color.",1334966400,,289,5.170212765957447
8399309,5,B003L1U3WK,"This little video was fairly short and to the point.  Nevertheless, He explained and demonstrated basic posing for portraits well.  I wasn't super impressed with the video quality, but since I learned from the video what I was desiring to learn... I still gave it five stars.

Overall... well taught, but could have better videoing.",1314403200,5,332,5.0
8399310,5,B003L1U3WK,"I am an amateur photographer and have a good understanding of Photographic Triangle (aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO),
white Balance, Light metering (I do have an incident light meter, which I used to get the correct/accurate exposure) etc etc..

I do take some very decent exposure (always take my photos in Manual Mode), but after seeing this DVD, I have learned a lot
and realized that just knowing only how to take perfect exposure is not good enough, and you need to learn how to make
people pose to take your photography to the next level.. Needless to say, Manny did an outstanding job of explaining things and
putting things into perspective..  Great Job Manny!!

In Summary, to put things in perspective, so far have been taking somewhat good pictures of people but this DVD has made me take
better pictures.  Must have DVD for all those who want to take their photographic skills to the next level.

Thanks

I love taking pictures of landscapes and seascapes etc. However, if you're anything like me, they're always family functions and social settings where I take pictures of people. This DVD has open my eyes to a whole new way of photographing people. And the beauty is the photographs that I take after watching this DVD have improved tremendously. I have also purchased ""The Skilled Photographer"" and I am equally pleased.

I would love to go to school for photography but I have two jobs and no time. This training video makes it very easy and convenient for me and I am very happy that I am a ""Get the Picture"" fan.",1299542400,8,763,4.651851851851852
