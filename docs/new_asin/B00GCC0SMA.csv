8622153,5,B00GCC0SMA,my grandson loves Tractor Ted - the books are great & he loves the  Greatest Hits CD.  I do also buy off the UK site directly as well.,1422489600,,134,3.75
8622154,5,B00GCC0SMA,"Another great DVD from Tractor Ted. My 1.5 year old son loves the DVDs and asks for ""Ted"" every morning. I am happy to put this show on for him instead of one of the other ridiculous kids shows out there. Tractor Ted is educational and fun. I really don't mind watching it repeatedly. This is something every father should get for their own sanity!",1404691200,,348,4.369230769230769

8622156,5,B00GCC0SMA,Got one for my grandson and had to buy all of the collection that I could get.  He knows that there is one more that is not our region -Autumn Time- and he wants it so very much. Wish I could get it for him.  I recommend any one of the Tractor Ted DVD's.,1390780800,,254,3.685185185185185
