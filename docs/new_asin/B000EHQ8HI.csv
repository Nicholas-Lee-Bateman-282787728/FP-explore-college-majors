2518820,5,B000EHQ8HI,"Chonda Pierce is a scream!  Her show is a beautiful collection of jokes, songs, and pieces of her, her brother's and her sister-in-law's testimony.  If you don't have the opportunity to see her concert in person, or if you just need a refresher, watch this DVD.  She will move you every which way there is, especially closer to God.  God bless Chonda!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laughing-in-the-Dark-A-Comedian-s-Journey-through-Depression/dp/1582296413/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laughing in the Dark: A Comedian's Journey through Depression</a>",1185148800,,588,7.013698630136986
2518821,3,B000EHQ8HI,"got this for my mom who LOVED it but when i watched it, i found her laughing at herself more than i was. it has some funny stuff but not as much as i had hoped.",1178582400,2,160,3.4722222222222223
2518822,5,B000EHQ8HI,fun. Chonda brings laughter out in a way that needs to be a practice for other comedians. You will want to watch this over and over!,1178582400,2,132,4.115384615384615
2518823,5,B000EHQ8HI,Great DVD. Chonda is a very funny lady. She keeps me in stitches.,1176249600,,65,4.076923076923077
2518824,5,B000EHQ8HI,"I purchased this for a gift so I haven't watched it myself, but I know that anything featuring Chonda Pierce is excellent.  After hearing pre-views of this DVD on the radio I wanted it for myself!",1174953600,,196,4.444444444444445
2518825,1,B000EHQ8HI,"Chonda's attempts at humor are usually at someone else's expense--usually her husband's. Her audience seems too easily satisfied with her minimalist humor. Pity she doesn't stick to singing, as she has a very good voice. In all, self-absorbed evangelical candy-floss. I was very disappointed with this DVD and will not repeat my mistake in the future.",1167782400,2,351,5.285714285714286
2518826,5,B000EHQ8HI,"This was hilarious & touching all in one hour.  Chonda is so funny, yet she can turn it around and really get to the meat of how God is good to her.  I recommend it to everyone.",1162598400,11,177,3.7567567567567566
2518827,5,B000EHQ8HI,"Oh I just love Chonda Pierce. I have both the cd and video. I went and saw her in person. She is just so precious, and hilarious. We need more Christian comedians like her. I would recommend this to everyone.",1156464000,10,208,4.225
2518828,5,B000EHQ8HI,"I was lucky enough to attend the taping of this DVD back in January.  The range of emotions I experienced that night was unexpected and rather amazing.  I literally went from laughing hysterically to bawling my eyes out in about 2 minutes flat.  That, my friends, is the power that is Chonda Pierce.

I'm nowhere near menopause yet but her take on the ""change of life"" is nothing short of hilarious!  Then again, this woman could probably make the A-B-C's funny.  There's something about the way she delivers a line -- the tone of her voice and facial expressions -- that is second to none.  The stories about her Mom and the mini-bar and the plastic nativity set (have you seen Jesus?) are some of my favorites.

Other highlights of ""A Piece Of My Mind"" are the powerful musical numbers.  Not only is this woman funny, but she's an awesome singer too!  Ok, so the menopause-inspired ""Heat Wave"" isn't really ""powerful"" but it is a rather creative parody on an old song that we all know and...well, know.  The other three songs, ""My Soul Will Wait,"" ""Christ Is Formed In Me"" and ""I Want To Say Thank You,"" will have you reaching for the tissue box.  Simply brilliant!

If you're a sucker for bonus features like I am, then you'll be quite happy!  The chat with actress Sheri Shepherd is a heart-warming and frank look at what it's like to be a Christian in Hollywood.  Of course, there are a few laughs thrown in for good measure.  That brings us to my favorite part of the DVD -- the bloopers!  Well, you'll just have to buy the darn thing and see those for yourself!  ;-)

Bottom line: Buy this DVD.  It will make a ""precious"" addition to your collection!",1143590400,48,1657,4.478260869565218
2518829,5,B000EHQ8HI,My church friends and I were ready for some fun and relaxation and decided to watch this together.  So much fun!  Chonda's humor is clean and on-point for real life situations.  And it's interwoven with an uplifting message.  We laughed and cried together.  What more can good friends ask for?  Ready for more!,1302825600,,310,4.754716981132075
2518830,5,B000EHQ8HI,I saw a chonda video at a church gathering and thought she was hilarious. Was so happy that I could buy her CD. She is so funny and it is nice to be able to listen to very funny and very clean.,1265760000,,193,3.619047619047619

2518832,5,B000EHQ8HI,"This is without a doubt, one of the funniest I have ever seen.  We watched it at our womens retreat and everyone was laughing their selves silly.  Chonda Pierce is a CHRISTian comedian so all of her comedy is clean, wholesome and side splitting funny.  I highly recommend this to everyone and anyone, children included.",1255392000,,319,4.763636363636364
2518833,5,B000EHQ8HI,"Having just discovered Chonda Pierce, I can't get enough of her.  She is ""so stinkin' funny!"".  This is the second dvd of hers I've purchased, as well as her book and her cd of her songs.  In addition to being hilarious she has a magnificent voice.  If you enjoy Christian humor that is not blasphemous, this is for you. Most enjoyable.",1243641600,,336,4.459016393442623
2518834,5,B000EHQ8HI,"Chonda Pierce does great ""down-home"" comedy, primarily aimed at women, but doesn't leave the men entirely out of the picture. Her brand of comedy talks about differences between how men and women view their world in such a funny way, that you can't help but laugh. She is also an excellent singer and mixes her two talents to create hilarious parodies of popular songs that you'll want to hear many times. More importantly, however, is that time near the end of each program when she will tell a story from her personal life that will tell everyone that no matter how deep their personal pain is, Jesus is there to bring you back to life. While the phrase ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" has been heard in many places, here it really is the truth. I have most of her programs and enjoy them all.",1242604800,,790,4.493055555555555

2518837,5,B000EHQ8HI,"I like Chonda Pierce and I liked this video. If you know her, you may find the humor just toned down a notch from the past videos of hers I have watched. She has experienced some depression, but I am dealing with some cancer issues and found it very helpful. I am looking for any good reason to laugh right now and she met that need perfectly. It is hard to find clean humor these days.",1219968000,,386,4.092105263157895
2518838,5,B000EHQ8HI,This video is very intertaining.  Chonda is a gifted comedian and singer and blends the two talents into a wonderful statement that God really loves each of us.,1217462400,,160,4.714285714285714
