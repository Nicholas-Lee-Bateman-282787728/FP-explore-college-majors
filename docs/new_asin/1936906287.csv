7802051,1,1936906287,It was great until the end.  It was scratched or something like that.  It didn't work right!!  :-(,1422144000,,98,4.333333333333333
7802052,3,1936906287,"The Content is five stars, but the quality of the media is one.  I had to return the first order because of poor dye dispersal for the recorded material (disk 1 & 2), which resulted in read error on both of the disks (disk three looked good, uniform spread of reflective media across the recording surface).  Amazon was quick to send a replacement for the defective product; however, the second item had issues on disk 1 and 3, again bad dye dispersal.  Poor dye dispersal can lead to read errors immediately, or reduce the life of the product.  Sadly, the quality of a DVD product must be measured by more than the recorded content.",1397606400,,633,4.526315789473684
7802053,5,1936906287,"This is a great DVD set for anyone who has children who want to learn the right way, the biblical way, to share the gospel.  It's done in easy to digest 30 minute segments with a bonus feature on evolution.  We got it because my wife works with middle school aged kids and one of our daughters wants to be a missionary when she grows up, she's 10.",1396310400,2,347,4.088235294117647
