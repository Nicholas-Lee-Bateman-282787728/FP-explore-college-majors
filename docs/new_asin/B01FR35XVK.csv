8761245,5,B01FR35XVK,"This series is a brilliant, highly sophisticated and well-made mix of documentary material and 14 ficticious stories of various European characters. From their perspective the viewer experiences the horror and trauma of WWI. The stories are based on true diaries that give a subjective multi-national insight into the struggle for survival and the unbearable suffering in the trenches as well as at the home fronts. Topics of war go beyond fighting scenes as the viewer accompanies the personal experience of those involved as attackers and as victims. The complex narrative technique is an intriguing mix of an English narrator, dialogues in the characters' original languages as well as the momentary direct addressing of the viewer by the characters themselves. Even for younger viewers with little history knowledge this series is a great opportunity to identify and empathize with those not mentioned in history books: children, desperate mothers and wives, separated lovers and child soldiers. Each episode of a different topic focus creates a high level of suspense, as you want to find out how the characters cope and grow. 14 diaries is a sublime and unique cinematic experience for everybody interested in Europe's devastating history of wars.",1517961600,,1253,5.365482233502538

8761247,5,B01FR35XVK,"This was a fantastic representation of how WW I effected many lives.  Actual footage of veterans who were suffering psychological problems that caused physical symptoms were very helpful for class.  The only difficulty was that it is in European format, and  that creates difficulty.  I watched it on Netflix, but would very much recommend it if you can find a player.",1487808000,,368,4.983606557377049
8761248,5,B01FR35XVK,"Okay, this is not a review of the DVD, but the version of this program as it's shown on Netflix. This is a fantastic series about WWI, told through the actual words of people who lived through it, with some additional background info for context. Sometimes the episodes can be hard to watch, as the suffering is not skimmed over (thought it's not exploited for gory effect, either). The design is a bit flashy, but that's probably good for educational purposes, as kids today are used to fast-moving imagery. The production design and acting are top-notch (each character speaks in his or her own language, with voiceovers and subtitles), and the stories at least touch on I think every nationality that was involved in WWI; they don't just focus on Germany, France and England. They also give attention to homefront activities; basically they try to cover every aspect of the war, not just the battles, but the way war touches a variety of lives--people of different occupations, ages and classes--in unexpected ways.",1481241600,,1018,4.924418604651163
