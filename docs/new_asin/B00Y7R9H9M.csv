7208765,3,B00Y7R9H9M,they took alot of great actors and a good story that could have been a really good romance and made it dumm.  not my favorite sandra dee movie,1437091200,,142,4.071428571428571
7208766,4,B00Y7R9H9M,"1966? couldn't make it out so well. As a very non-fan of Sandra Dee, she was so cute in this one. This had a terrific cast too. George Hamilton as the staid boss, Celeste Holm as the mom who thinks her daughter should be a singing star. and as her suitors, Bill Bixby, Dick Kallman and Dwayne Hickman. this is a sweet and cute movie that approaches something very taboo for the time, pregnancy out of wedlock OMG, yeppers, what a horror. As long as you can time travel back and understand that the times were very different, from the with child thing to the role of women in the work place. you will have some fun.",1437091200,11,614,4.256410256410256
7208767,4,B00Y7R9H9M,Not as sugary as some of Sandra Dee's films.  Lots of comedy.,1436313600,,61,4.083333333333333
7208768,5,B00Y7R9H9M,"Doctor, You've Got To Be Kidding ! starring Sandra Dee was released by MGM in 1967. I saw it in the theatre. I loved it because she had a more grown up type role. A girl who has a job, and dates several men. The hilarity begins when she is pregnant,and they all want to marry her. Her character also is a singer, so Sandra really gave her fans something different. Great support from George Hamilton, Bill Bixby, and Celeste Holm. Fans of Sandra Dee will like this the most.",1434412800,12,474,4.277777777777778
7208779,3,B00Y7R9H9M,Another of those great comedies that the british industry was so good at. Recommened for those interested in this genre,1468108800,,119,5.0

7208782,5,B00Y7R9H9M,"I love Sandra Dee movies and have been waiting a long time for this piece of fluff to appear on VHS or DVD, so I'm a happy camper!",1461369600,,130,3.6785714285714284
7208783,4,B00Y7R9H9M,"Sandra Dee is such a classic.  When I first saw this movie as a teenager it inspired me for what became the focus of my career goals.  Sounds silly now, but what started out as taking ""secretarial"" classes has turned into a Masters degree in International Transportation Logistics.  So you just never know what is going to inspire you to life's journey.  All in all in today's cinema the acting is pretty cheesy, but that doesn't change the fact that Sandra Dee is and will always be a Movie Classic!",1457654400,4,500,4.522222222222222

7208786,3,B00Y7R9H9M,This is a very light movie meant to just roll along in it's plot. Sandra Dee really could have never become a singer...in life or movies. George Hamilton was a new popular actor at the time. I thought he acted the best of the two leads.,1453420800,2,236,4.1521739130434785

8717644,5,B00Y7R9H9M,"Typical 60""s comedy, adult themes but family friendly. No preofanity, no nudity and Ms. Sandra Dee as our lovelynleading lady with CelestevHolm playing her mom and three would be bachelors trying to catch her.",1524787200,,209,5.176470588235294
