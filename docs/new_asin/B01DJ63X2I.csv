 I had no trouble playing it and the subtitles are well chosen and accurate. [I should know as I am familiar with the Austrian dialect and way of speaking in general]. If you have a multi region DVD player, you'll be just fine . Only don't play it in wide screen, that will ""swallow"" the subtitles. Other than that, ENJOY!",1529107200,,518,4.56989247311828
8755989,1,B01DJ63X2I,"This item is not listed honestly. The batteries for the electronic barking dog are obviously dead from many years in storage.
So saying that this is a special ""Barking Dog"" box is not true.
The episodes are not in the Original Austria Broadcast order.
The episodes are listed on the DVD by an often mistranslated English title instead of the original German Title.
Two of the DVD cases are very poor quality. The one DVD is so difficult to remove that I am afraid that I will break it.
Very poor quality and organization.
The Extra Liner notes are printed on the back side of the paper cover insert. You have to remove it to read it.

Under Linux using VLC to play the DVD, I can not get subtitles to work.
The audio tracks on the DVD are mislabeled. They should be labeled as German, they are labeled as English even though the actual audio
track is in fact German. This mislabeling prevents subtitles from working properly.:",1525132800,,926,4.511904761904762
8755990,5,B01DJ63X2I,"One of my favorite shows, I get a kick out of a dog that's smarter than most of the cops and all of the criminals.  My DVD player was USA only so I bought a Philips Region Free DVD Player - 1080p HDMI Upconverting - PAL/NTSC.  The DVD player works fine and the DVD's of Inspector Rex are very clear - much better than on TV.",1514592000,,324,3.893939393939394
8755991,5,B01DJ63X2I,"Inspector Rex - what a delightful series.  We had Season 1 and so sorry when it ended and I searched every where looking for more seasons and I found it here.  What a gorgeous dog Rex is - the amount of time the trainers must have put into this series.  The comraderie among the actors, the acting, scenery, stories - all get our vote as a 10.  Pity we didn't know about this treasure until just now but were sure enjoying it.  Lovely Rex, Inspector Rich and the other two main characters turn in a remarkable performance.  A gem from Austria, in German with English subtitles.",1514419200,,577,4.39622641509434
