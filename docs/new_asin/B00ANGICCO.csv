5459765,5,B00ANGICCO,"Excellent writers produce an amazing series set in war time England.  Incredible acting, intriguing mysteries with wonderful period costumes, sets and cars.  Already pre ordered set seven and looking forward to the production of season eight.  Some of the best shows I've ever seen.",1367625600,,282,5.363636363636363
5459766,5,B00ANGICCO,Suspenseful to the very end...endearing and wholesome.  Filled with enough history to take the viewer on the spot and live the mystery.,1367539200,,135,5.136363636363637
5459767,5,B00ANGICCO,Great story lines and characters made better and even more interesting by its setting in England during WWII. There's 18 or more episodes and it's  'a page turner'.,1367366400,,164,4.857142857142857
5459768,4,B00ANGICCO,"The series excels at interweaving the traditional English murder mystery into the WWII backdrop.  It is a brilliant premise. Very often the murders evoke the ambiguities of war, not just the conflicts.  Michael Kitchen is simply a wonderful actor.  His expressive face and subtle body language convey much more than his lines.  And the camera catches this beautifully.  Honeysuckle Weeks and Anthony Howell are also fine in support.  Generally the writing is first rate with elaborate set-ups and linkings between the various plot characters.

My two beefs are first that the DVDs need concurrent subtitles along with the audio (they are available only in set 6).  As it is the subtitles are accessible only with audio off.

A more serious distraction is the level of stretch needed to introduce current political correctness into many of the story lines.  The businessmen are always greedy capitalists out for mere profits at the expense of the war effort.  We are repeatedly reminded of how the working women were terribly exploited with poor pay relative to men.  Black American soldiers are discriminated against (true) but nevertheless exude the essence of nobility (in reality no more or less than anyone else). Aristocrats can be expected to be hiding some terrible past secret, usually having killed off their past wives.  Almost all German soldiers and spies are depicted as innocent victims of circumstance; one doomed spy even gives critical and voluntary testimony to aid a criminal investigation in the country he is pledged to defeat. Really?  Sometimes the viewer can get the feeling that the talented writers are out to demythologize and stereotype the Brits of that era.  The series would have been more challenging to watch and better overall if it had mixed in an element of unpredictability into these otherwise tiresome patterns.

The writing for Set 6 does not quite live up to the level of the first 5.  More stereotypical characters and predictable plots prevail.  It might have been better to stop at VE Day and leave it at that.",1367280000,12,2054,5.044510385756676
5459769,5,B00ANGICCO,"Glad that this is finally affordable!  I use several of the episodes in my homeschooling.  In America, it is hard to imagine the impact WWII had on Europe---especially London.  Whereas our boys went to war, the war went to them.  Helps to balance out a history lesson.  Hopefully the next episodes will be written and done as well as the earlier ones in this series.  Hopefully they will keep the integrity in Foyle and keep it watchable for conservative households.",1366934400,,466,4.7625
5459770,5,B00ANGICCO,I had seen several of the Foyle's War episodes on PBS and enjoyed them very much.  This set was perfect.  I enjoyed every episode.  This is the way to get these shows.,1365811200,17,167,4.15625
5459771,5,B00ANGICCO,"Loved every second on these DVDs, am thoroughly spoiled to just about anything else, better than Downton Abbey I, II and III, in my opinion.",1364774400,42,140,4.64
5459772,5,B00ANGICCO,"FOYLE'S WAR presents Brit Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. It is a 1940-45 Southern country experience not to be missed. English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany.
3 episodes of Foyle's Post-War (summer 1945) are done in the same 6-YES, SIX-STAR excellence. Foyle longs for retirement, but it's not to be [great news for fans]. Period drama precision detailing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense

FOYLE'S WAR is also a series the best 21st century written TV murder mystery ever presented by creator/writer Anthony Horowitz. A modern classic for sure. Foyle's War is fiction, but so authentic to detail that this series is a MUST for historians.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the front, not investigating Hastings crime. Milner (Anthony Howell) does much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb. A female driver, ""Sam"" (Honeysuckle Weeks) is gorgeous with a winning smile. Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines. Including facial expressions, performances are nothing short of perfection.

Numerous guest stars in each episode known stars seen in top Masterpiece Theatre productions. Additional post-war episodes airing in Sept, 2013. A set of all previous episodes to prepare the way for those new adventures.

5459829,4,B00ANGICCO,"The story line is great.  We are getting to see the beginning of WWII in a whole different light.  As Americans, our parents and grandparents did not know the horrors of having their cities and town bombed night after night, never knowing if they would have a home to go back to.  At the same time, the TV series, Foyle's War showed that no matter how terrible the home front was due to war, crime still went on.  Some crimes were related to the war, but others had nothing to do with a world war.  The characters of the three actors are well drawn and totally believeable. and I cannot get the theme music out of my head!!
The main character is, sometimes, a little underplayed and he could have shown a bit more emotion, but he was still very good in his role.",1475193600,,762,4.263888888888889

Christopher Foyle is an amazing character with some flaws but a great deal of heroic qualities. Michael Kitchen's understated portrayal of the stoic detective is engaging and captivating. Sam is the perfect sidekick and these mysteries are historical, educational and just plain fun to watch. While this show deals with murders and crimes, this program remains classy by avoiding gore and explicit sexual content, unlike other British productions. My only wish is that these earlier seasons were available on Blu-ray!",1449100800,2,678,5.0625

5459869,5,B00ANGICCO,"For my money, ""Foyle's War"" was one of the best detective shows to ever grace the screen, as this collection clearly shows.
It had everything: An intriguing setting, believable characters, great story lines, and a hero who is the kind of detective you'd want working on your own case. Michael Kitchen was brilliant as Foyle, a veteran of World War I who is both too old and too valuable as a police inspector to serve in the British military during World War II. Just insubordinate enough to solve cases without getting tied up in bureaucratic nonsense, he pursues leads with dogged determination and a keen insight into the human psyche.
Honeysuckle Weeks also shone brightly as his driver Samantha (Sam) Stewart, a young woman who joined the Army's transportation corps to ""do her bit"" and wound up being assigned to the police department for assorted reasons (including her own touch of insubordination.) Together she and Foyle wound their way through a series of remarkable cases ranging from the capture of German spies to the arrest of the person who murdered a young (and very pretty) bootlegger. Throughout the series they dealt with corrupt higher-ups, American soldiers, and a host of criminals that came in all sizes and shapes.
The series was also remarkable for its dedication to the period in which it is set: The costumes, including the uniforms, are always correct; the automobiles are of the right vintage and the dialogue is spot on - you won't find any too-modern words or phrases creeping in.
All in all, a series that's not to be missed.",1447891200,4,1558,4.860902255639098

I like Foyle's War episodes very much, except they do not have close-caption feature and I frequently do not understand the dialog, which diminishes my enjoyment of the stories.  Episodes 1, 2, & 3 of Set 1 played fine, but the 4th disk (Eagle Day) got stuck in the 4th scene and would not play any further.  This is the first time that this disk has been played.  I was advised that it was too late to return.  I am very disappointed that I can't finish this episode without buying the whole set again.

5459917,5,B00ANGICCO,"Foyle's War is a compilation of the entire series, but does not -- I believe -- include the final (post-war) season.  Set in and around the English coastal town of Hastings, the series tracks the cases investigated by DCI Christopher Foyle during World War II.  Though the episodes can be a little formulaic, they are well written and superbly filmed, with loving attention paid to getting the look and feel of wartime Britain just right.  It's also great fun spotting young actors on the verge of stardom as they appear in guest roles..

The series is rooted in the strong performances of Honeysuckle Weeks as Sam Stewart, Foyle's able driver (and a symbol of the ways in which the war irrevocably changed women's roles) and Anthony Howell as DS Paul Milner, an injured war veteran who rejoins the police force at Foyle's urging and becomes his right-hand man.

Still, the success of Foyle's War rests squarely on the shoulders of the extraordinary Michael Kitchen, who delivers a performance as DCI Foyle at a level of sustained brilliance that it becomes an acting master class.  Foyle is a reserved and private man who appears at first to be aloof and unemotional.  He almost never raises his voice or loses his temper as he methodically investigates the complex crimes that plague his beat.  Yet so strong is Kitchen's acting that we quickly grasp Foyle's decency, integrity and sense of personal honor as he pursues the truth regardless of where it takes him.  Despite the apparent limits of a role that is deliberately written to emphasize Foyle's reserve, Kitchen works wonders with a simple glance, a raised eyebrow, a slight tilt of the head, or the mere hint of a smile to show us that Foyle cares deeply about his colleagues and the job he must do.  It is an astonishing performance that tells us more about Foyle in a glance than pages of dialogue ever could.  In the process, Michael Kitchen makes Foyle's War one of the best series ever broadcast.",1441497600,3,1962,4.758112094395281

5459994,2,B00ANGICCO,"This set has closed captioning ONLY on Season 6 despite the DVD cases which all state that they have closed captioning.. I have hearing loss and cannot follow the stories without captions.  I called Acorn Media U.S. and they told me that the captioning would work only if I had a composite video connection to my TV.  So, I set up the player and the TV for component video, and the captioning still didn't work.  Furthermore, this kind of connection has a much poorer video quality than does an HDMI connection.  On discs where it exists, such as the Season 6 discs, captioning works just fine, but not on all the others.
This is a shame because it is a wonderful set of programs if you can understand them.  I don't understand why these fine programs cannot be put out in Blu-Ray or DVD format with working captioning just the way my DVD and Blu-Ray discs of the Downton Abbey seasons work.  The main work of the captioning has already been done as evidenced by the fact that there was captioning on all the Cable TV programming of all the seasons.  And, I am deeply disappointed that Acorn Media is claiming to have captioning when it does not.",1431820800,6,1146,4.480769230769231

5459997,4,B00ANGICCO,"After watching this series three-times through, I thought I should contribute a review for it- So, here it is.

There is so much to praise about this series it was hard for me not to give it 5 stars. It has excellent actors, stunning scenery, compelling storylines, and of course historical relevance regarding the homefront situation in England which few if any war movies truly depict.
Yet, it is on this last aspect which I decided a demerit must be shown by denying the fifth star rating.

While great effort is given to creating an period feel to the series in the way of sets, shooting locations, and props, it seems the Writer's own politcal biases have colored the mood and sentiment held by the average Brits during the time. Example: He entirely exaggerates the British resentment of American GI's arrival in England, while at the same time nearly ignoring the common outrage with their own government's extremist measures with relation to such things as confiscation of property aka ""requisitioning"", not to mention any of their most basic civil rights. Much of those properties and rights were never to be restored after the war's end! Such was the militant-socialist march England was being herded into.
There's no mention made of the chaos created throughout England at that time by the Labor Unions which were communist/socialist dominated, and whose efforts to sabotage Britain's war efforts by staging strikes for unrealistic causes were in danger of shutting down Britain's mining industry especially. The Labor Unions were by definition hot beds of treason within the empire, but do to their political connections never prosecuted as such.
Another gross misrepresentation made is that of the average GI regarding their being called upon to fight. While it IS true that many American Servicemen felt that they were being called upon to rectify the naive and maladroit attempts of the Chamberlain government (Note: The Liberal Party) to negotiate ""peace in our time""; many more had a simple moral compunction to stop the evil threat to humanity which German National Socialism embodied. Any heel-draging done by Americans was against any notion that their sons & daughters lives would be hazarded to save & defend an old world Europen hegemony. It must be remembered that, that generation had not forgotten how they had already once been dragged into one hellish war to save and defend the old aristocracies of Europe only to be thanked by being treated as the ugly junior cousin by the League of Nations; especially at Versailles.
Despite Wilson being another naively optimistic socialist like Chamberlain, he at least protested that the stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles went too far beyond reparations, and bordered on inhumanity. As it turns out, we (America) were patted on the head and told to run along by the likes of Great Britain, France, and the other old world notables. As a result, the injustices visited upon the German people after WW1 became the catalyst of their unbridled hatred for all League Nations, and the genesis of NAZI regimes lust for revenge.
So it is that when we hear the average Brit in Foyle's War rehearsing their litany of complaints against America; i.e. - ""They were late for the first war, and it seems they'll be late for this one too!"", there is no attempt by the story writer to answer these complaints from the American point of view. Should I have been present I would simply have responded- ""You made your nest Limey, now roost in it!"" A Muslim assasin shot crown Prince Ferdinand of Austria, and in response, you sanctioned that act by taking sides against Austria in her outrage. You dismissed with high-browed contempt at Versailles when we begged you for a more moderate approach regarding Germany after that war, and as a result have begotten yet another monster threatening the entire world. And NOW you complain that we do not jump in fast enough to save your bacon?!""

One might think at this point that I harbor some animus towards the British people, or worse... sympathy for Hitler and the NAZIS, neither of which could be farther from the truth. It's a minority of Americans who have the familiarity with the Britiah and their history than I. Fewer still have the affection for England and her common folk. No, it is that minority who have rested control over and enslaved the average Brit which I have disdain for; the same sort of disdain I hold for Hitlerism, NAZISM, socialism, and tyranny in all it's forms. The average Brit lives in a dream bubble crafted by the politicians who who enslave and milk them for every last freedom they can steal without being rudely apparent about it.
THIS is why the average Brit responded with such shocked embarassment when our troops began to arrive in England even as early as 1940. When they saw how well off the average American had it, living in a truly free capitalist society in contrast to their own soft tyranny, they were embarrassed to the point of envy. It's reflective of their own brainwashed state of mind that they felt Americans were over-paid in comparison to the bread crumbs their own government allowed them. As for over-sexed... That was yet another slap in their face when it became apparent that even their own women found those men born and raised in freedom and independence much more appealing than a man cowed by generations of soft tyranny and deprivation. And for being ""over there""; as I have already said, most Americans would have preferred to stay at home and allowed the likes of France and England to reap what they had sown. It was however not tenable that in so doing, the rest of the world would be spared.

I suspect that in this age where it is so popular to denigrate America, even by some Americans I'll not get many ""likes"" to my review: I could care less. Had the Writer of Foyle's War been more balanced in his treatment of the issues addressed, I would have felt no compunction to address them myself.

So, it is a good show. I highly recommend seeing it. But with the added caveat- it is NOT to be taken without copious amounts of salt.

Enjoy.",1430956800,,6112,4.805133079847908

5460017,3,B00ANGICCO,"I love Foyles War and for the price of this full set of seasons 1 thru 6 is well worth it. However, I am reviewing the DVDs not the Programs so pay attention to what I have to say. I have a brand new top quality DVD player capable of Blue Ray, 3D and 1080p projection just in case someone says Oh it must be his equipment. The very first program in season one ran bright and clear. Programs 2, 3 and 4 of season 1 are colorless and smokey dull as apposed to bright and clear. Thats as far as I have gotten in my viewing. I am hoping that as I go along in my viewing, the picture quality gets better. Another thing, my hearing is not the best and I sometimes like to supplement my hearing by turning on Subtitles or C.C., ""Closed Captions"". The box said C.C. on it but now that I have it in my hand, I can read the fine print that says there are no subtitles or C.C. for seasons 1 thru 5. It says that Subtitles are available for season 6 only. That was a big  disappointment. I gave this review 3 stars because the quality of the DVDs is questionable, The Foyles War series is well worth seeing and I give that a full five stars. My advice is, shop around, do your homework and know what you are buying.",1429574400,,1203,4.0125

5460074,5,B00ANGICCO,Anthony Horowitz is the amazing researcher & writer of this remarkable series.  He captures England's suffering during 1940 through 1945 with historical precision.  I challenge history buffs to find a flaw.  Foyle plays Superintendant of Police in a rural part of southern England.  Michael Kitchen is brilliant as the complex title character.  He doesn't need to say much; a raised eyebrow or curl of the lip allows the audience to read his thoughts.  The supporting cast are superb as well.,1421366400,,492,5.0875
5460075,5,B00ANGICCO,"Flipping through TV channels late at night, I would often land on an airing of this show, which seemed quiet and slow and boring. Friends recommended it highly, however, so when it was on sale, I took a leap and purchased the set. They were right. While it is a quiet show (no background music to cue you to how you are meant to be reacting to events), it is also an engaging, character driven, look at the crimes that continue to take place during war time. Watched in sequence, the relationships as they develop among the core characters, is realistic. The setting and costumes are also excellent.",1421366400,,599,4.555555555555555

It is very nice to be able to view the entire story without interruptions or waiting a week between each quarterly installment of a single episode.  Michael Kitchen was to me the perfect choice for DCI Foyle.  From James Bond to Foyle's War, Mr. Kitchen has always given a strong and excellent performance.  With an excellent leading man and a very talented support cast that begged for good stories and scripts, the writers rose to the occasion and this phenomenal series was created.  I am truly enjoying watching this series and at my leisure rather than at the broadcaster's schedule.  I am sure anyone who purchases Foyle's War will be very pleased they did both now and in years to come.",1419984000,,758,4.5777777777777775

I don't know why I wasn't so enamored the first time I viewed Series 1, but when I came back to it this past summer, I was hooked, and watched the entire 7 seasons. I wish there were more episodes. The plot twists and turns are not predictable, and the pace is enjoyable. I like that each episode within a season is semi-independent so that you can enjoy them in any order. The historical context is believable, and each episode makes for a pleasant meander back in time to enjoy a time long gone.",1418774400,2,515,4.319587628865979

A classic British crime/mystery series, brilliantly played by Michael Kitchen and the supporting cast.  Excellent technical direction, making one believe that one is actually in WWII era England.  Rationing and hunger, black marketing and corporate treason, murder and mayhem, and mundane family problems...all can be found here and DCS Foyle is involved in solving them all.

He is a consummate actor and does more with his face than they could have produced with working over the script.  All of the weekly characters get well developed and the whole thing introduces us to an England that we knew little about since it wasn't what we heard about getting ready for D-Day.

5460149,5,B00ANGICCO,"A great series well done by BBC and brought to us by PBS.  Foyle takes place in WW2 when England was in the war and the Germans were bombing England.  Even though the war was on England still had it criminals, and murders.  Foyle, played perfectly by Kitchen, is a police detective who desperately wants to get back into the Army but during WW1 he was badly hurt and they won't let him back in but they do need him as a detective and he is a great detective.  The PBS series is very well done it brings in just about every thing you can think of and presents a view of what and how London and the English functioned during the bombings, the rationing, the spies, and just about everything else during that sad time.",1409875200,,715,4.235294117647059

He came to visit us last summer and was ""forced"" to watch one of our favorite British dramas.  Unlike our other grandchildren, he did not go UGH at this show but instead asked questions.  He liked it!

The Foyle series is a great look at the history of WWII and how it affected the English people.

A simply excellent series of well-constructed complex murder mysteries with added bonus of being wonderfully executed historical dramas set in the English coastal homeland (invasion ground zero) during  WW II.  Michael Kitchen's droll, no-nonsense, but very human Detective Superintendent Christopher Foyle and partners --  the injured war-vet Sergeant Milner (Anthony Howell) and his youthful, naive, but enthusiastic woman driver ""Sam"" (Honeysuckle Weeks) -- also set this series apart from the rest of the other well-done British murder mystery series,each with their own casts of distinctively British eccentrics.

5460212,5,B00ANGICCO,Foyle's war is an  historical piece that combines the events of World War II with the police matters that still continue in a time of war.  Well done series that becomes addicting after watching the first one.,1404950400,,209,4.621621621621622
5460213,5,B00ANGICCO,"I am not an Anglophile, and my wife dislikes British TV because the accents can be hard to fathom at times, but both of us thoroughly enjoy this series following the cases of a small town Chief Detective Inspector from southern coastal England during WWII.  Every episode has some tie into the larger war (hence the series title) and is normally a good mystery with plenty of character development in the series.  The lead actor is amazingly good, and all of the series principles are very good.  It is a bonus of the series that it really puts you in the setting of small town WWII Britain and makes you feel what it must have been like to live through the period.  The writing and acting are really first rate!  Bravo to everyone involved in this masterpiece of a series!  Occasionally it is hard to understand the dialogue because of the thick accents of some characters, but that is a minimal price to pay for this absolute gem of a series.  Highly recommended!",1404864000,,965,4.543352601156069

I cannot recommend this series high enough. This series is an incredibly well researched period (WWII) British mystery series and I highly recommend it. My only wish? Blu Ray, but it doesn't appear to be out in that format yet except for series 7 which, of course, I now have.",1404691200,,445,4.632911392405063
5460215,4,B00ANGICCO,"I met this series by its back door, ""Volume 7,"" containing 3 post-war stories tending to illustrate subjects at the center of Noel Annan's ""Changing Enemies,"" an important memoir by a fine educator. The strength of the first 6 volumes lies in an ""authenticity"" many have admired, in depicting the experience of the British people in the early '40s, in incidents of diverse complication. A sameness of perspective - call it a taste for paradox - gathers and contradicts this virtue, at least if one consumes the series in close order. It is one thing, to be certain of viewing a murder mystery, and another to be certain of its being shaped by a persistent viewpoint. But I give it four stars for its important historical achievement and for being produced, across the board, with fine standards.",1404691200,,795,4.810218978102189

5460241,5,B00ANGICCO,"The post WWII Foyle is even better than what went before. Perhaps it's because we're familiar with Foyle and Sam by now, and can enjoy watching their characters evolve. Many reviewers have commented on the LeCarre-esque murk of the plots, and that's a fair comparison. It's ultimately the action that draws us in, though -- watching two good people struggle with others who may or may not be good, or who may only temporarily achieve that state.

We liked it so much we purchased this huge set of 6 DVDs and are now happily watching World War 2 affect the English countryside - something this generation didn't have to live through. It becomes a terrific history lesson, on top of the standard story lines. The characters are well developed; the settings are true to life; the stories are mostly believable; the British low-key humor is irresistible. We have some British roots in the family and have visited often - it's fun to hear about familiar locales. The actors within the series provide non-verbal communications with such great ease! The facial expressions of Foyle and his driver Sam are often the best part. It would be best to start at the beginning to see the development, as in any series, but the episodes also could stand alone. Each episode is 90 to 100 minutes long - giving time to develop the plot.",1403308800,,979,4.6976744186046515

Michael Kitchen uses his ability to emote the most subtle of feelings and thoughts in just the raising of an eyebrow.  The series depicts the interesting stories that occurred on the home front while  World War II was raging.  Life and crime went on and that's where Foyle comes in; waging his own war on criminals in the country villages of England.  Love the show!  So much so that I bought this set for my mom.

The actors are fine, both the leads and the episode-specific players.  Michael Kitchen is the dominant glue holding the series together and setting its tone, while Honeysuckle Weeks is just plain delicious.  The villains are credible flawed folks and neither criminal masterminds nor mindless morons.  The direction is solid, with the pacing never lagging or rushing.

Each episode is based on real events, and you learn a lot just by watching. Each disk has a 'special feature' page which gives more detailed historical information related to the episode.

There is one episode on American Series 6 called The Hide.  It is one of the best stories in TV drama that we have seen.  Terrific acting and story line.  We think it could have been a movie shown in theaters.  We are really happy that they are currently making a new series, American series 8.

5460290,5,B00ANGICCO,"The only quibble I can present for this series is that the writers try too hard to make each episode contain a murder mystery of earth-shattering importance. It's hard to fathom how the little town of Hastings could be perpetually in the front line of the war. It's a supreme irony since the series commences with Foyle complaining about how he'd rather be assigned to a job with more significance in fighting the war. By the end of the series Foyle has done more for the war than an armored division! But this is a trivial quibble. The writing overall is superb, the acting top-notch, the storylines intriguing and the humor subtle and perfectly balanced with drama and story.

All the clues you need to know who did it are given to you. All you need
to do is pay attention. The acting is great and the show cast delivers what
you would expect from a great British Series. Proves again that when it comes

5460296,5,B00ANGICCO,"This set did not disappoint! I have sometimes felt deprived of the full experience of the story by the lesser visual quality of some DVDs that I have watched. Maybe it's the fact that I played these on a newer Blu-ray player, rather than a DVD player. Neverthe less, I was impressed by the crisp quality of the picture and did not have a single regret that I had purchased DVD rathe than Bluray. I had only viewed 2 or 3 episodes of Foyle's War on PBS, previous to this purchase, but that was enought to make me want to see them all. To me, the stories are very plausible and give a genuine period feel for the era...and, of course, the acting is excellent.

The acting is excellent, the production is exceptional.  Our only complaint is sound, it fades in and out noticeably, particularly during the first 2 sets.  This is all that's between 4 & 5 stars to my mind, I'd strongly recommend Foyle's War to anyone.",1393459200,2,403,4.728571428571429

I did not rate it 5 star only because set 5 disc 3 had a glitch or hiccup in it an hour into the movie.  I spent about 1/2 hour going forward and reverse to get over this hiccup so I could continue on with the movie without missing anything as going forward jumped way too far ahead even though I did it slowly.

I'm intrigued how  he secretly sorts through the evidence and analyzes what the witnesses say without giving a hint to what he is thinking or who the guilty party is until the very end. I like that characteristic frown or ""Foyle look"" he exhibits when he is challenging someone.
I highly recommend Foyle's War to those who love mystery detectives and who pride themselves in thinking they're good at figuring out who is the guilty party. It is my hope that Foyle's War will continue beyond series 7, which I have.",1391904000,,632,4.693693693693693

5460315,5,B00ANGICCO,"Having so far viewed the first four of the six albums in the set, I am absolutely enthralled by this superb series.  I relish good drama, especially mystery, and this has quickly risen to become my all time favorite.  Each installment introduces several possible suspects in its central murder which is interwoven with sub-mysteries, all masterfully unraveled by Foyle--Michael Kitchen speaks as fluently with his silent expressions as he does with his sparse insightful questions.  It's intriguing (and quite educational) to observe how diverse facets of the home front war effort are woven into each story.  While each episode stands on its own, the ongoing development of the personal stories of each of the main characters along with their interactions and personal relationships is fascinating, so you really must be sure to watch the episodes in their proper sequence.

One bonus which must be mentioned:  On-screen violence is minimal (unlike the relentless darkness, blood and gore so prominently displayed in most of today's TV shows and movies).",1391731200,,1055,5.287425149700598

5460323,5,B00ANGICCO,Great show with good story lines and great actors .  Much better to sit down and watch a good mystery compared to a reality show. Another British show which is just as good if not better is Midsummer Murders. You even get to see some beautiful English gardens in a lot of the shows.

5460328,5,B00ANGICCO,"MICHAEL KITCHEN, AND OTHERS. FOYLE'S WAR. THE HOME FRONT FILES. SETS 1-6 (22 EPISODES), ACORN AMP-8600.
This DVD series is about a fictional DCS (Detective Chief Superintendent) dealing with crime and criminals in WWII England, and is supposedly based on a compilation of actual police cases, with a little artistic license tossed in to make the stories more interesting.  DCS Christopher Foyle has to do his job while also dealing with allied military personnel, as well as German spies, saboteurs, and the crews of shot down German aircraft.  He manages to juggle all these conflicting agendas, personalities and egos, while remaining calm and perceptively going about his job, like it was just another day in his small rural police department, the Hastings Borough Police.
The only gripes I had were a couple of DVD glitches, and the often tedious behind-the-scenes extra segments that were yawn producing and had to be taken in small doses to prevent dozing off.  I finally gave up on the extra segments. Another gripe I had was with the flimsy cardboard box that the DVD containers were packaged in. The box is open on one side, and the DVD containers can easily fall out into a pile on the floor. What is needed, is a sturdier box with a Velcro closure, a snap closure, or some other type of locking closure on a wraparound lid or overlapping lids.
Is it worth buying? Yes. Even after viewing these DVD's, you can easily find yourself watching them again on PBS, to fill in the time on a slow TV  evening when there is nothing else on TV that is worth watching.

 Set 1: The German Woman; The White Feather; A Lesson In Murder; Eagle Day.

It is set in Lancaster during WWII and covers Foyle""s solving of various crimes.  The historical references are accurate and sequential.  Foyle has a unique quiet investigative approach questioning the suspects in a casual non accusatory method.  The stories are intriguing and the outcomes are often far from where the story appears to be going until in the end the viewer can see that the murderer was the logical target of Foyle's questions and the research work of his appealing sidekicks.  The show is done with class and respect, touching on everything from racist situations to gay burden new in the 1940's.  All the shows are adult but suitable for young adults as there is never a vulgar scene.  It is a class act from start to finish and very entertaining.",1390176000,,901,4.743589743589744

5460332,5,B00ANGICCO,"After watching and watching again, the episodes of this WW II series about life in Great Britain, I feel I have been treated to a first hand look at what life must have been like during the years of war.  It is about a policeman, who wants to do more to fight the Germans but manages to solve  the messy parts of life made by people who have their own agendas. Christopher Foyle is brilliant but not so it shows.  Everyone seems surprised when he solves a case.  He has to make decisions I am sure others in the War had to make as what to do for the bigger picture, when crimes have been committed.  Should a murderer  go free just because he or she is involved in the British military and doing a good job at what he or she does?  No wonder Foyle goes fly fishing to escape the decisions he has to make, to  enforce the changing laws.  He wants to do more for the war effort  without realizing he is a stabilizing force of all that Great Britain is fighting for.  Great series.",1389830400,,978,4.148936170212766

Detective Chief Superindendent, Christopher Foyle, investigates his crimes with methodical accuracy while exposing the ravages of World War II in his community during the early 1940s.

This set also includes interviews with the writer and creator and historical backgrounds, which make for a thoroughly enjoyable 22 episodes.  Well worth the cost of the set.  You won't be disappointed.",1389657600,,505,5.341772151898734

5460348,5,B00ANGICCO,"I don't want to get too involved in the plots, but mainly I wanted to point out that I nabbed this when Amazon dropped the price to $39.99.  As I write this review it is currently $44.99, which is still a steal!

The show begins in the early years of World War 2 and is based along the south coast of England in and around Hastings (apparently quite a sketchy place in these years! - kidding!).  Micheal Kitchen plays Detective Foyle, a very wry and intelligent police officer stationed on the home front.  During the years of the war and even in some of the post-war years, he is tasked with various duties such as solving murders, investigating other crimes, unraveling espionage and spy networks, and all the other home front fun.  The series could have been a letdown but the writing and acting are top notch.  Even the supporting cast is amazing.

Each episode is film length (90 to 100 minutes), so the viewer has plenty of time to get into the plot and become acquainted with the characters.  Some of the characters appearing in individual episodes are known for other series and films, and it is quite fun to see some decently high profile British actors appearing in this series (such as David Tennant - shame on you if you don't know 'Who' he is).

I wouldn't say this is in the same style as other top British series such as Downton Abbey, so it is hard to compare it to some of the other favorites.  As far as comparing this to other crime themed dramas, I feel this might be the best in years, if not the best ever.  Each time I thought I might lose interest, something happened that caught my attention - or Micheal Kitchen uttered another snarky response!  In any case, I highly recommend this series for those fans of intelligent crime dramas that have a little more story and aren't afraid to explore some of the story surrounding the crimes.

I would rate 6 stars if I could!!!",1389052800,4,1895,4.457971014492753

It said on the box that it should be done from the Main Menu but we would never figure our what that meant. We tried to turn them on through the Samsung DVD player but could not.  However the Season 6 disc had the option plainly on the menu and he was able to view the three discs in that.

5460359,5,B00ANGICCO,"I would rate this as one of the best mini-series ever made.  I originally bought this thinking I'd watch it and then re-sell it.  It is now part of our permanent collection.  We liked it so much that we bought the sequel (Set 7) and couldn't wait to receive it.  We are now waiting anxiously to see if there will be a Set 8, etc.  The characters are superb, and you literally never want it to end.

5460363,5,B00ANGICCO,"I think this series is extremely well written and delivered - I flew through the watching of it.  Great character development, and the story lines are intriguing!  The series enlightens those of us who did not live during WWII to many different aspects in ""living color"".  Strong British accents enhance the video but can be challenging at points, so you may find it helpful to make use of the closed-captioning from time to time if you want to catch all of the dialogue.  Most of the time the meaning carries through loud and clear even if you don't catch every word.",1388448000,,568,4.594059405940594

5460365,5,B00ANGICCO,"You know, I don't even care for shows about detectives and police but one night I had been watching PBS and this came on and I was doing something else when this came on and didn't turn it.  I started watching it and it was so good.  From then on, I started looking for it and became so hooked on it.  Michael Kitches and Honeysuckle Weeks are simply superb as is this series.  The other regular actors on the series are fantastic too.  I  so wish I lived in England.  They have much better TV shows than we do here in the States hands down no contest.  This is a great series that everyone should watch.  If you have never watched Foyle's War, I dare you to watch just one episode. You will want to buy this complete set too.  I got this at a fantastic discount during the Black Friday sale and I am so thrilled to have gotten it, especially at the deep discount.  I just wish I had gotten a couple of more for gifts for my Dad and Brother and Sister-in-law.

He IS Christopher Foyle. His acting is always quiet, subtle, and facial expressions usually say so much for the part Kitchen plays.  I can only say that if you are interested in great acting and great story-telling, this is the series to watch.  I would give it 10 stars, but 5 will have to do!",1388361600,,472,4.222222222222222

I watched the newest season on PBS and realized I wanted to see more.  The nice sale that Amazon ran on Brit series provided the opportunity to purchase this collection.  I have not watched the entire thing yet, but what I have watched I have enjoyed and look forward to watching the rest.  The transfers are decent.  When you are used to watching HD and/or Blu-ray it's not quite that good; however, it's certainly adequate and won't disappoint.",1387584000,,560,4.55

5460384,5,B00ANGICCO,I am a late arrival to watching Foyle's War.  An enthusiastic friend loaned me her copy of series 1 which got me hooked.  Not long after watching these episodes the special offer from Amazon for this Series 1-6 collection came out.  I purchased it and am now enjoying watching each episode in sequence.,1387584000,,302,4.660377358490566
5460385,5,B00ANGICCO,Absolutely wonderful series! British film making at its best. Every episode has its twists and turns with superb subtlety. Michael Kitchen is perfect as Inspector Foyle.,1387584000,,169,5.538461538461538
5460386,5,B00ANGICCO,"I first thought Foyle's War was not interesting, but that only lasted about 10 minutes.  Michael Kitchen is riveting as the detective who must enforce law and order in a country desperate over the anticipated German invasion and the constant and deadly bombing by German planes.  More than that, however, is the wonderful interaction between Foyle and his son, a British RAF pilot.  Thrown into the mix is Foyle's driver, an irreverent and opinionated vicar's daughter who interferes with Foyle's protocol for proper British detecting and respect for status.  The series is both funny and tragic, but I promise it is never dull.  Bernice Bruce",1387497600,,643,5.085714285714285

5460388,5,B00ANGICCO,"Absolutely love this series, as it combines history with mystery.  I initially rented each disc, but decided to own them so I can view them quicker.  Wonderful performances by all actors and captures the spirit and pathos of Britain during WWII.",1387411200,,245,4.951219512195122
5460389,5,B00ANGICCO,"In my estimation there are some series that can be watched again and again and Foyle's War is one such series. I have been borrowing it from the local library once a year during the winter season and finally decided to own it. Some of the indoor scenes are a bit dark at times but that isn't a detriment unless you watch it in a brightly lit room, such as on a sunny day with the curtains open which I have done. The acting is excellent. It is both a World War 2 story and a police story, but the perspective is from the home front; the drama and scenery give the viewer a tour of  British daily life and culture during those difficult times.

Michael Kitchen plays the role of a detective chief superintendent (he refers to himself as a policeman) who as a veteran of the Great War really wants to do more toward the war effort but is needed to solve local crimes because he does it so well, sometimes too well by uncovering crime-linked corruption in high places thus causing more than a little discomfort to the overconfident. He has been a favorite British actor of mine ever since I saw him in Enchanted April where he plays a very different role from that of 'Foyle'.",1387411200,,1173,4.327272727272727
5460390,5,B00ANGICCO,Just a great series - fantastic insight into the WWII period in England.  Extremely well-written.  Remains a mystery until the end.,1387238400,,131,5.190476190476191
5460391,5,B00ANGICCO,"While not as action packed as American detective TV, this British import more than makes up for it with carefully crafted plot lines.  I knew very little about the series and bought it on a whim and a gamble.  I'm glad I did.  I practically watched straight through the six sets and went back on-line to order the seventh.  As a history buff, I especially enjoyed the historical setting.  While the majore events were known to me (the bombing of the cities and the air war), I found the minor background events almost as interesting as the mysteries, i.e. a population trying to cope with rationing and the very real threat of invasion,  I whole heartedly recommend it.",1387152000,,669,4.627118644067797

5460393,5,B00ANGICCO,Michael Kitchen and the rest of the cast are really something special in this WWII era detective show. There's something wonderful about watching his unshakeable ethics confront the difficulties of solving murder cases (oftentimes tied up in political intrigue) during wartime.,1386892800,,277,5.780487804878049
5460394,5,B00ANGICCO,"Michael Kitchen's portrayal of Foyle as a low-keyed, calm and thinking man is excellent.  The re-creation of war time England, with the mix of its warts and its beauty, loyalties and mis-placed perceptions, greed and selflessness is incredibly well done.",1386460800,,254,5.35

5460401,5,B00ANGICCO,I have never enjoyed a series as much as this one. Christopher Hitching's character becomes an alter ego. I was so sad to have finally watched them all.,1385424000,,152,4.464285714285714
5460402,5,B00ANGICCO,"Michael Kitchen is a rare treat. On-screen and off, he goes at his own pace and does whatever projects he pleases. Stage theatre being his first love, his film or TV appearances are relatively few (outside of some U.K.-only programs and a fair bit of more classical ""Masterpiece Theatre"" appearances). ""Foyle's War"" is finally a meaty and sustained program for hungry fans to feast on.

Christopher Foyle is a perfect gentleman - never raising his voice and only rarely losing his composure - but now and then, there's a twinkle in his eye and a barely perceptible but mischievous smirk on his face. Kitchen makes a fascinating character study out of a potentially dry and overused character framework (the ""aging detective""), but viewers who aren't used to paying attention will miss out on some of the fun. This is not a ""listen only"" show; while the dialogues are usually excellent, the scripts also depend heavily on body language and good camerawork (which this show has in spades). Yes, Foyle is at the start of being an old dog, but his patience and stillness are what very often allow him to spot details that everyone else misses. It's also a delicious cover for the scores of people who are too foolish (or guilty) to realize his observation skills.

In contrast to Foyle's succinct demeanor, we have Sam Stewart (courtesy of the delightful Honeysuckle Weeks). Sam is breezy and precocious (sometimes dangerously so), but not frivolous. Her dogged nagging and motormouth tendencies are sometimes a great asset to solving a case, yet many of her observations are simply incidental ""thought overflow"" rather than attempts to outshine her superiors. I personally was impressed that the writers/producers were able to walk the tightrope so well with regards to the role of women during the war: they neither minimize nor magnify Sam's presence but simply point out that women did have certain capacities in war efforts other than typing and the tea cart.

Foyle's other sidekick, Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), is a different breed of sorts. His temper can cloud his judgment (caused partially by a P.T.S.D. ""prototype"" that is subtly explored in early episodes). He can be quite impatient and doesn't have the quiet wit of Foyle, yet his intelligence usually restrains him from doing anything truly foolish. His ambition is more extroverted than Foyle's, so he has a more ""hungry"" approach to catching criminals.

One nice thing about this show is that the tranquility of rural life shows through so well without diminishing the urgencies of war and crime. The London air raids have been oft explored in film, but the effects of war on smaller towns and country dwellers are still a bit murky. This show is not a constant barrage of white-knuckle murders, thefts, and other unpleasantness (it's certainly the main point of the show, but a historical ""Prime Suspect"" this show is NOT). Foyle might not have much of a social life, but Milner and Sam certainly do, and the plots weave together work and play in a beautiful way. This brand of whodunit sometimes hinges on one or two tiny details or misunderstandings (some of the deaths are actually quite accidental and only appear grisly at the beginning), so the endings are not always as sad as you would expect them to be. This show's typical mood is a good exercise in melancholy because it is more observation than adrenaline rush. There are no serial killers or terrorists in the genuine definition of the terms. This show is slick without being ""plastic"" - 95% of the time, you believe the sets and the people populating them.

I'm not necessarily a history buff, but when I prompted several friends (who adore WW2 history) about this series, they all agreed that a surprising amount of details were very accurate in the show (not a perfect 10, of course, but not bad at all compared to other shows). Visually, there are some lovely sights to take in. Scenery, set, and costume are equally pleasing to take in (and Kitchen sure looks sharp in a hat and tie). For any driving or flight fans, there are plenty of old planes and shiny cars to look at.

The pacing of each episode will seem slow to some viewers, but if you find yourself getting sucked in, the minutes will pass by in an instant and you might just find yourself galloping through the whole series.",1385251200,,4321,4.824561403508772
5460403,5,B00ANGICCO,"Excellent: the acting, plots, authenticity, morality, compassion, excellent characterizations, and authenticity during WW2 without goriness or gratuitous violence.

This is one of the best series I have ever purchased and I have purchased a LOT!  PBS, BBC, ACORN, etc.  I am an avid fan of Brit shows of all types and genres.  FOYLE'S WAR is a masterpiece, well written, brilliantly acted (bravo Michael Kitchen), and a window into life during WWII.  I've spent tons of money on DVD's that I love, but this is one that I am so glad I purchased so I can share it with others.

Chief Inspector Foyle maintains order on the homefront, in the south east coastal town of Hastings, while the war rages on across Europe & England, impacting the day to day lives of Hastings residents.  Viewers never wanted the war or the series to end.  So it was gratifying when the series recently reappeared for a series 7, picking up again in 1946 and continuing on into the developing Cold War with Soviet Russia.  With retired Chief Inspector Foyle, returning from a year long trip to the United States,  recruited by an old friend to join the newly created MI5.  Despite the ruckus he raised with the FBI while on his private mission in the U.S.  So best to watch the series in order.

Yes, it is set during WWII and there is plenty of action for the guys but women will enjoy the character of Christopher Foyle, among others. The acting and writing are top-notch and the director and staff clearly are dedicated to historical accuracy.  My husband is a WWII buff and is very impressed by the accuracy of the series, down to the smallest details.
We love how well the relationship of Foyle, Milner and Sam works.  Although there are 22 episodes in this collection I find myself
""rationing"" them so that they will last longer!  Network television, in my opinion, is a virtual wasteland and when a series like this comes along (Broadchurch, Sherlock, Doc Martin, etc) I am happy to be able to purchase them.",1383177600,,897,4.546583850931677

The quality of the packaging is very poor. They must be rushing the manufacturing process because of the revived popularity of Foyle's War due to the new episodes.  It just came today and I have not watched any of the discs yet. It is more than disappointing to start watching without the first episode where the characters and setting are introduced.

5460417,5,B00ANGICCO,"Foyle's War is the one of the best series ever on TV.I don't normally post reviews,but in Foyle's case,I made an exception. You happy now Amazon?",1381363200,,145,4.615384615384615
5460418,5,B00ANGICCO,"Foley presents one of the best English dispositions. One of common sense, fair play, honesty, and dry English humor. Michael Kitchen is superb in the role. And I highly recommend this series.",1380931200,,191,5.0
5460419,4,B00ANGICCO,"All too often, period dramas wallow in self-conscious portrayal of an era, and not infrequently they populate the set with characters that are people of our time in costume. No such pretension nor anachronism here. Set in wartime Britain -- though the series has extended to the postwar years -- these stories hold their own in terms of plot and characterization while presenting an often meticulous and invariably correct setting for the tales. The period detail is certainly there, but it's presented in a purely naturalistic way, without calling attention to itself. The the ensemble cast perform fabulously together, all held together by Michael Kitchen's perfect portrayal of the central character. If you're looking for period mystery on video, this should probably be your first stop.",1380931200,6,791,5.285714285714286
5460420,4,B00ANGICCO,The historical research that goes in every episode adds a special quality to a very British mystery. You have a traditional mystery with real life added in.  The characters are interesting and real.  Foyle is a man who believes in justice but has compassion for the victim and the killer.,1380844800,3,288,4.74
5460421,5,B00ANGICCO,I have watched Foyle's War off and on while at friends homes and I'm watching the current series on TV.  But I wanted to start from the beginning to see the characters unfold.  I love the way they tell the story with a minimum of visual violence.,1380758400,,246,4.212765957446808
5460422,5,B00ANGICCO,"As a collector and admirer of British Mysteries I have always enjoyed Mr. Kitche's performances in what ever he has been cast in. In ""Foyle's War"" he is not only the pre eminent Police Superintendent that we all would wish to have in our Police forces, but his dry and sometimes droll demeanor captivates his audience and makes us believe that Justice may be blind but a good man no matter what his position will always see and act on the truth. A very well written series, with his later forays into the murky  waters of British counter intelligence is very well done. Lets just say that at the end of each episode you have a satisfied feeling that Justice has been done",1380672000,,671,4.455284552845528

5460426,5,B00ANGICCO,Michael Kitchen is a superb actor whose facial expressions or a subtle twitch of the face speaks volumes.  The historical accuracy makes this gripping series so enjoyable.  This is our recent history of a generation that is nearly gone.  Young people would do well to follow this series and delve into the history of their grandparents.,1380412800,,336,4.964285714285714
5460427,5,B00ANGICCO,"I have not yet watched all of the shows but from what I have seen, Michael Kitchens really makes this show.  The supporting cast is okay but Kitchens makes the show a rousing success in my opinion.",1380067200,,197,4.324324324324325
5460428,5,B00ANGICCO,"With TV the way it is these days, my family has opted for good drama.  The British may have it right.  This drama takes a historical perspective of crime in Britain in the late 30s and early 40s.  The characters are likeable and well developed.  The wit and humor are what I'd expect from the British.  A little dry but no less humurous if you catch on.  I like that I can watch the series at my leisure, not having to wait until next season.  This one is a blast and well worth your dollars for a score of full length movies.",1379894400,,526,4.098039215686274

5460433,5,B00ANGICCO,"I got this series for my wife but we both watch it. The careful development of the main characters, the camera work, and the mix of history make the series enjoyable. Compared to the quality of so much shallow US programming with scene switching after seconds, special effects, and plots from never-never land, this series is refreshing.",1378944000,,337,4.9298245614035086
5460434,5,B00ANGICCO,"This is the perfect of the British Myster Story set in the midst of the chaos of WWII.  The characters are perfectly established in each of the episodes in what appears to be well researched period trappings.

5460439,5,B00ANGICCO,I love a good mystery and Foyle's war is on par with Agatha Christi. It also has great characters that seem very correct to the time period. I also am amazed at how much actual history is mixed into the show. Not one episode has disappointed me.,1377302400,,245,4.23404255319149
5460440,5,B00ANGICCO,"If you're tired of the over-dramatic, hyper hyperbole of American murder mystery series with their ultra-destructive car chases and ultimate shootout with an artillery of weapons, then join viewers of Foyle's war for a quieter, more civilized view of crime solving story-telling, even as it is set in the midst of WWII.  Michael Kitchen's portrayal of Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle has a calm, reassuring manner that's a refreshing change from the standard American style.",1377302400,,476,5.4324324324324325
5460441,5,B00ANGICCO,This is by far one of the best series out there.  I cannot wait for the newest glimpse into Christopher Foyle's world.

The DVD's arrived very timely and in great condition.  Looking forward to the many hours of a truly great program I now have waiting for me.  The writing, acting, and background historical accuracy in this series sets a high bar indeed.  Michael Kitchen is just stupendous.  I'm a Yank in love with British TV.",1376524800,,464,4.4
5460444,5,B00ANGICCO,"Friends recommended this series to my husband and me, knowing that we like British mystery series and that we do research on the military and economic history of WWII.  This series is the perfect combination for people with our interests, but it is far more.  We were struck by the extraordinarily high quality of the script, the likeable characters, and the great acting.  Michael Kitchen is particularly gifted.  The weaving of each murder mystery with the various WWII-related threads is seamless and leads to very interesting ethical trade-offs on the part of the characters.  We rank this series with some of our all-time favorites from the BBC, including Brideshead Revisited from the 1980s and the more recent Downton Abbey.",1376006400,,731,5.109243697478991
5460445,5,B00ANGICCO,"I think all the good mystery writers moved to England. Foyle's war is a program that ranks up there with mid somer murders, inspector lewis, murdoch(which is canadian), inspector morse,pie in the sky,a touch of frost. You have intelligent plots, good storylines, with reasonable drama. unlike american mystery where the drama is surypy, bullets are flying every where, continual conflict with each player, and some where in the mix of special effects there is a plot(exhausting) foyle's war is very entertaining. The back drop is world war 2 and the main character does what every good police detective does, he solves crimes. each disk is a 100 minute drama. This package contains all the war series. If you like good mystery you can't go wrong with this set up.",1375660800,,763,4.922480620155039

5460448,4,B00ANGICCO,"I would give Foyle's War 5 stars for content.  I gave it 4 because sadly, there were no captions.  Even if you are not hard of hearing, the English chatter goes by so quickly and so many good ""asides"" are lost for lack of understanding.  The series itself is amazing. Some confusion in the time frame.  Events happened that we didn't see with the characters and we have to assume that a wedding took place or some closures were made to office buildings etc.  All in all, I would not avoid this series because of that.  I have already pre-ordered season 7.  For value, it's makes sense to buy all 6 series in the box set.  It is much less expensive.  Enjoy!",1375056000,14,656,4.311475409836065

The attention to detail is very apparent in every episode.  The everyday lives of people dealing with the war right in their backyards is something I hope to never have to experience first hand.
I would recommend this series to everyone.  It definitely was worth every penny.  To buy the individual series would have been much, much more.

Kudos to Horowitz for pulling the plots together. Kitchen is the master of non-verbal expression. The cast is well chosen and they interact with their special attributes. I've watched the series a dozen times and I'm still finding new things. Although each episode is it's own entity, the character development grows with the series, so it help at one time to watch it from beginning to end. It's the best buy in town and you can't beat the price. I've purchased this series for some friends who didn't care for TV series and they ended up inviting their neighbors over once a week for a ""Foyle's"" party.

Foyles War is the best I have seen in a long time.  I usually purchase most Brit mystery DVD made and have some of the best available in my collection.  This series is unique and holds my interest continually.  Michael Kitchen has an unusual talent in that he can say much with few words.  His facial expressions tell it all.

The package. On the positive side, this is a very good transfer and is up to Acron's usual standards. On the negative side, there's the packaging. Instead of one episode per disc they could have put two on each of the four episode series's, however. Disc three of set six was cracked so I had to return it adding a layer of annoyance into the purchase. The packaging is up to Acorn's usual standards: AWFUL. It had already split apart at its poorly glued seams before I even took it out of the Amazon box. Note to Acorn: put as much care into your slip cases as the rest of your product. Your slipcases as a general rule are quite awful. The keepcases are quite flimsy. 2.5 stars

She enjoys the Masterpiece programs, and likes to watch them again and again, sometimes as a ""marathon.""  However, my mom doesn't like me to spend money on NEW DVDs for her.  So, I try to find them on ebay or at the Goodwill-type stores in town.  Sometimes, however, I do buy them new.  Then I open them up before I mail them to Mom, so they appear to be used.

When I saw the boxed set at this really good price, I knew I had to get it for Mom.  When the they arrived at my house, I made them look used, and then I mailed Mom the first couple of series for Mothers Day.  Later this month, the next couple series will go out for her birthday, and so on.

Yes, it's a tad deceitful, but Mom likes a good DVD and a good bargain, so, why not?",1370822400,69,875,3.8926553672316384

HOWEVER the reality is that only the first two seasons are about 100 minutes, with the remaining seasons being 91-95 minutes each. The UK DVD set gets this right -- 22 episode for ""2085 minutes"" which works out to be an average of 94.7 minutes per episode, or 34 3/4  hours.

When funds permit I'll complete the Cold War seasons seven and eight.

Michael Kitchen's character is filled with integrity and mercy while at the same time he is dogged in his pursuit of the truth.  All around Foyle are bad guys trying to take advantage of the war and many 'good guys' who will cross any line to win the battle.  As they say, ""In war, truth is usually the first casualty"", 'Foyle's War' proves this axiom over and over.",1522108800,,754,4.274647887323944

So far, they are terrific.
The only problem I had was that the presentations were unsplit, i.e., each ran about 140 minutes.  Tough to limit viewing time.",1503273600,,242,4.4772727272727275
