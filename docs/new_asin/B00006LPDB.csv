1784951,3,B00006LPDB,I was disappointed with this film.  I love the Greeks and their achievements.  The film has a  slow narration by Pierce Brosnan and visual effects which reminded me of the Jason and the Argonauts I saw wen I was a kid 30+ years ago.  I did like the piece on the lighthouse.,1194912000,2,273,4.1923076923076925
1784952,3,B00006LPDB,"This DVD was a good presentation of the seven ancient wonders of the world, but is rather short, and basic in terms of the information provided.
For anyone who has seen the BBC documentary on the 7 Wonders of the Industrial World (which was exceptionally done), this one is somewhat limited.",1191110400,4,291,4.7254901960784315
1784953,5,B00006LPDB,"Throughout history, ancient civilizations were skilled at creating amazing sculpture and architecture that is still inspiring even today.  Knowing that they didn't employ modern day construction techniques and didn't posses the tools we have now makes it even more incredible how these wonders were built on such a massive scale.

During the program, besides getting a brief history lesson on each of the monuments, there is ample time given to demonstrating the antiquated but interesting methods used to erect some of these huge structures.  Also looked at are the then known studies of math and physics and how they figured into the design and construction processes.

Unfortunately in today's world, the only great wonder left out of the original seven is the Pyramid of Giza.  But thanks to computer graphics and digital rendering, you can still see the other 6 wonders reconstructed (redrawn) as they would have looked in ancient times and they are simply amazing in every way.

`The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World' is an entertaining and informative documentary from start to finish.  The narration from Pierce Brosnan is clear and distinct, the video footage is very nice to look at, and there are 4 worthwhile extra features that compliment the main program in several ways.  This is recommended viewing for anyone who likes this type of material.  Also, the distributor of this program, Questar, also has another excellent DVD titled `America's National Parks - A video tour of all 55 National Parks' and this is also highly recommended viewing.",1178668800,3,1559,5.130434782608695
1784954,4,B00006LPDB,"If you are researching an academic paper this, obviously,is not for you. If you are interested in the subject and want an interesting and entertaining programme to watch then I can heartily recommend this DVD. Often I read reviews in which a programme is criticised for not being exhaustive, if an exhaustive account is what you are looking for then look in the ""Books"" catergory. Sometimes details are generalised for the sake of brevity but, although I was aware of this, I never found it reduced the overall enjoyment. I would have given it 5 stars had there been more in the way of expert interviews, but that is just my preference. The computer graphics were great and since buying this DVD a few months ago I have watched it three times. The extra features are excellent.",1145232000,16,777,4.678832116788321
1784955,5,B00006LPDB,"This film was aboslutley wonderful!!  I used to teach history at the University level and found this video very useful to both my students and peers.  In addition, it was refreshing to see people of different cultures played by actors who actually looked the part.  No wonder this film won so many awards!!",1141430400,9,306,4.735849056603773
1784956,1,B00006LPDB,"I do not think any video or book can adequetely treat the subject with accuracy and not hype. Aside from only showing the barest ruins of these ancient structures (where they still exist), the only presentations that can be made are by comparison with resemblant structures. The video does not show the more extensive remains of the temple of Apollo at Didyma in Turkey for its similarity to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, or the mausoleum of President Mckinley for that of Mausolus on which it is based, or any Mesopatmian ziggurat for the Tower of Babylon. Of course the one reconstruction that is also possible has to have the cooperation of the Alexandrian Egyptians--- to rebuild the Crusader castle of the Pharos Island site of the ancient lighthouse into that 'wonder' since it is the same size and shape as the lighthouse base was; reconstruction details could be supplied by the Roman sculpture panel of the Ostia lighthouse built during Claudius' reign which was based on the Egyptian model. But as it is, the deficiencies of the subject are too great for video presentation.",1139788800,4,1088,4.854838709677419
1784957,5,B00006LPDB,I highly recommend this video - I teach Honors Ancient History and to my knowledge there isn't a better DVD on this topic.,1087430400,20,122,4.3478260869565215

7971510,5,B00006LPDB,"The Seven wonders of the Ancient World, how those words conjure up visions! although I believe they got the Colassus wrong, the coverage of these long gone wonders  ( the pyramid still stands but is a ruin) is spectacular, and well done. I can easily recommend this series of programs as they are both informative as well as magnificently done .",1466467200,,345,4.655737704918033
7971511,5,B00006LPDB,"I am a fan of history, so this is right up my alley, so to speak. The ancient wonders covered here are the classic ones, Pharos, Zeus's statue, the Hanging gardens, the pyramids, and so on. The presentation is fantastic, and very well done. A little short on history, but each site is brought to life vividly and in detail. The narrator does a great job of keeping you informed, pointing out what is known, and what is speculation. I highly recommend this film to all who are interested in these once proud places. This film sure satisfies!",1466208000,,540,4.520408163265306

7971516,4,B00006LPDB,"The video is very factual.  It shows first hand accounts of the Pyramid of Cheops and recreations of the others, as well as some of the remaining ruins.  Great addition to a world history class.  A bit boring if watched all at once, but split up into 2 days worked perfectly.",1286236800,,275,4.352941176470588
7971517,5,B00006LPDB,"Product catalog for KULTUR, the manufacturer of THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD, includes the most excellent ""Broadway Theatre Archives.""

The actual name of the British-made program on this DVD is LOST TREASURES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. Transfer quality of this documentary is excellent. Dynamic audio assures good speaker results on any DVD portable or notebook-type PC.

For anyone not familiar with this subject, a good deal of information is given in 50 minutes. We learn that most of the 7 Wonders perished in natural disasters,  also that our concept of their appearance is necessarily imprecise. Contemporary coins or texts are all we have to go on.

1.) GREAT PYRAMID OF CHEOPS AT GIZA
Although finished two millennia before the other six Wonders, this largest stone building on Earth is the only one to survive to the present day; no mean feat for a 4,500 year-old work!

2.) HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON
Built in the 6th Century BC by Nebucadnezzar for his homesick wife, who was born in a hilly country. A rectangular series of ever-smaller terraces rose to a height of 80'. Upon these platforms were lawns, gardens, and tall trees. Destroyed by several earthquakes after 200 BC.

3.) STATUE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA
Crafted by sculptor Phidias around 432 BC in honor of the Games, then at the zenith of their popularity. The sitting god had a wood frame covered with gold and ivory. After relocation to Constantinople, the 44' tall Zeus icon was consumed by fire in 475 AD, although it's a subject for debate.

4.) TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS AT EPHEUS
Completed around 550 BC, this colonnaded building located in what is now Turkey honored the fertility goddess Diana. Four times the size of the Parthenon, the gargantuan monument was ultimately destroyed by Goths in 262 AD.

5.) MAUSOLEUM OF HALICARNASSUS
Commissioned around 350 BC by the widow of Mausolus, who intended her husband's tomb to be the largest and most beautiful ever seen. Standing over 140' high and adorned with exquisite statuary and carvings, the Mausoleum has since given its name to all memorial buildings. Toppled to ruins by 13th Century earthquakes.

6.) COLOSSUS OF RHODES
100' tall statue constructed around 280 BC of brass plate over an iron frame, this monument to the sun God Helios stood near the harbor of Rhodes, but did not straddle the straits as once believed. After only 50 years, it fell in an earthquake, snapped off below the knees.

7.) PHAROS
150 foot tall lighthouse at Alexandria that went into use around 250 BC. Fire backed by a concave mirror supplied the beacon. It lasted nearly 1,000 years and was battered to bits by two early 13th Century earthquakes. The ruins were later used by Arabs to construct a fortress on the Pharos island.",1271980800,3,2736,4.851931330472103
7971518,2,B00006LPDB,"The 3-D graphics are a bit primitive, but you'll catch a certain sense of what made these 'wonders' so great in Greek and Roman times. The talking heads are all stuffed shirt Brits, but they stitch the tales together adequately.",1246233600,2,228,4.725
