1081747,5,6305837406,"Unlike modern films about WWII (i.e. Saving Private Ryan), the Story of G.I. Joe doesn't jump out and grab you.  There are no explicit scenes of human body parts flying through the air, blood filled waters and no  multi-million dollar special effects.  This film though, conveys the  horrors of war with more brutal emotion than any other film I have ever  seen.  The black and white celluloid projects soul were today's special  effects only provide flash.  The result is that the film takes a little  time to engage you, but once you get caught up in the lives of the infantry  soldiers, you really begin to care about and respect them.  The acting in  this film is brilliant and with great respect to Tom Hanks and the cast of  Saving Private Ryan, who also did an excellent job, could never be  duplicated today.  Even though the characters in the Story of G.I. Joe  become battle hardened soldiers, there is an innocence of time that half a  century later is lost on modern actors.  This same innocence is  communicated through the script.  The story walks a fine line between its  message of the evil of war and the goodness of the men involved.  Men who  are blinded by their duty.  This movie is a keeper, one to be watched over  and over again so that the subtle meanings and stark images can be more  deeply appreciated.",960595200,17,1330,4.553191489361702

1081749,5,6305837406,"Until Saving Private Ryan came along, this film was considered the sine quo non of all war features.  I saw it when it was first released and agree.  It was on NY metro TV for a few years and then withdrawn until a  few months ago.  The problem was in copywright and ownership rights but  that appears to have been resolved.  Mitchum's breakthrough role, it has a  toughness and reality of what an infantry rifleman's existence is all  about--fear, terror, horrible living conditions, and the awful feeling that  living long enough to get home is not an option any longer.  Unknown to  many, Mitchum plays the part of an actual infantry captain named Henry T.  Waskow of Texas and several scenes depicting his death come from Ernie  Pyle's book ""Ernie's War"", pages 195-197.  Read the book; buy the  film.  You will be shaken to the core as Captain Waskow's men say their  farewells to him as he lies next to an old stone wall.

1081750,5,6305837406,"While this is Hollywood's version of war, it is one of the best films of this type.  The story is simple and direct.  The acting is really supperb.  Burges Meridith and Bob Mitchum may have given the best performances of  their outstanding careers.  The supporting cast is also great with several  very execellent performances.
Interestingly, many who have seen this film  think the end is a little overdone.  But it is esentially taken directly  from an Ernie Pyle dispatch to the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance.  This  also appears in his second book of WWII reports ""Brave Men"" as  part of Chapter 11, ""Mountain Fighting.""
I have waited many  years for this film to reappear as a video.  They really don't make films  like this anymore.  See it, you won't be dissappointed.",960336000,4,779,4.876923076923077
1081751,3,6305837406,"I bought this DVD from Amazon as soon as it was released, based on the 5 stars given the film by previous reviewers, and the fact that I have a personal interest in World War II in Italy in particular.  It's an okay  film; the DVD production adds very little to the original (no audio  commentary for example), only a brief film clip of the ""real""  Ernie Pyle talking to some real G.I.s in Italy.  The movie itself has some  historical interest as it was made before the end of the war.  For example,  the contemporary account of the battle for Monte Cassino is interesting.  According to the liner notes the film was the first to establish certain  canonical cliches for its genre, and you will recognize at least some  scenes from later films.",959644800,5,745,4.485074626865671
1081752,4,6305837406,"The dvd is disappointing--scratchy print with really bad sound (claims to  be digital mono).  I suspect from the liner that its long unavailability on  video has something to do with Lester Cowan, the producer, whose name is  all over the cover and notes, almost as prominently as director William  Wellman's.  There are only two extras--a three minute segment with the real  Pyle talking to a soldier and one newspaper page with one of Pyle's  columns.  But the movie itself holds up pretty well, with no really false  notes of propaganda in the script (originally worked on by Arthur Miller!),  and the unrelentlingly nasty weather makes a real point about what the  infantryman's life was like.  The almost total invisibility of the enemy is  very interesting, and the obsession of the sgt. who is trying to play the  recording of his son is not as corny as I remember it.  Meredith is  excellent, and Mitchum, well, he never really grew as an actor but he's  wonderful here, even if his most powerful scene is as a corpse.",959212800,3,1026,4.732954545454546
1081753,5,6305837406,"I saw this movie many years ago and always considered it the best war movie ever produced. The stars were outstanding. Ernie Pyle could not have have played himself better than Burgess Meredeth and Robert Mitchum has  never been better in portraying the lt. loved by all his men. The  characters were everyday men who had a job to do and never considered  themselves heros. I could never understand wythis movie was never  reproduced on video or why it has never been shown on tv in over 40 yrs.

It does not have the special effects of ""Saving Private  Ryan"",but being made in 1945, it has the look and timeliness of the  ""real thing"" without the Spielberg touch. 150 men in this movie  were actual combat veterans which lends a lot of credence the movements and  actions of these soldiers. This was the first and only time, that Robert  Mitchum was nominated for an Academy Award. He was OUTSTANDING as Capt.  Walker.  Burgess Meredith is so great as Ernie Pyle, that Ernie Pyle could  not have played himself any better!
This movie will let you know about  the comraderie of combat citizen soldiers. Their personal anguish. Their  sacrifice and courage.

This movie shows the everyday life of the American G.I. in war as seen and written by Ernie Pyle.

1081957,5,6305837406,"""The Story of GI Joe"" is the true life story of newspaper reporter Ernie Pyle who was attached to US infantry units in WW 2 during the 1943 Italian and Tunisian campaigns. It stars Burgess Meredith as Pyle and Robert Mitchum as an officer in one of the units Pyle accompanied. Most of the rest of the ""actors"" were actually soldiers.

Beautifully shot in black and white, the film lets us walk along with Ernie as the soldiers move, from day to day, on their different missions, enduring the endless boredom interspersed with violent eruptions in which each man's mettle is tested.

William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman (1986-1975) directs. Wellman was nominated 4 times for an Oscar, winning for Best Writer in 1938 (""A Star is Born""). He was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA for ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954). During WW 1 Wellman was an aviator and made several air warfare films, such as ""Wings"" (1927), ""Men with Wings"" (1938), ""Thunder Birds"" (1942), and ""Lafayette Escadrille"" (1958). Despite his preference for the air force, he also made films about the infantry  - ""Battleground"" (1949) and ""Darby's Rangers"" (1958) - and the navy - ""Blood Alley"" (1955) and ""This Man's Navy"" (1945). Among his non war films are such classics as ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943) with Henry Fonda, ""Beau Geste"" (1939) with Gary Cooper and Brian Donlevy, and ""Public Enemy"" (1931) with Jimmy Cagney.  Wellman was one our greatest directors and he shows his talents in this film. Each individual scene is a thing of beauty, carefully crafted, and matching the best work of even the masters such as Ford and Kubrick.

Burgess Meredith (1907-97) is terrific as Pyle. In a 64 year career Meredith was nominated for an Oscar twice (""Rocky"" and ""The Day of the Locust"") and won an Emmy for ""Tail Gunner Joe"" (1977). Older viewers may know him best as the Penquin from the ""Batman"" TV series (1966-8). Meredith was an Army Captain at the time of filming and had to be released from service in order to portray Pyle.

Robert Mitchum (1917-97) received his only Oscar nomination for his role in this film, but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum's work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962) is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time. I liked him best as the drunken sheriff in ""El Dorado"" (1966).

Russell Metty (1906-78) handles the camera so well  it is almost a separate character. Metty won an Oscar for his work on ""Spartacus"" (1960) and was nominated for ""Flower Drum Song"" (1961). He worked with Orson Welles on ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), ""The Stranger"" (1946), and ""Touch of Evil"" (1958). He transitioned to TV in the 70s and worked on ""Columbo"", ""The Waltons"", and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"". Between Metty's camerawork and Wellman's direction  we have one of the most beautifully shot films ever made.

The music was composed by Ann Ronnell (1906-93) and directed by Louis Applebaum (1918-2000). Ronnell was the wife of producer Lester Cowan and is famous for writing ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"". The music is delicately blended into each scene, enhancing the exquisite camerawork and often speaking the lines that the characters are thinking.

The film was nominated for 4 Oscars (Supporting Actor, Song, Score, and Screenplay) but didn't win. ""Going my Way"" was the big multiple Oscar winner.  ""Gaslight"" did well at the box office and won Ingrid Bergman an Oscar. Of the top 10 films of the year the only war film was Bogart's ""To Have and Have Not"". Other notable films were Judy Garland's ""Meet me in St Louis"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", and ""Lifeboat"".

This movie is probably on everyone's list of top 10 war films. My own list includes ""Battleground"" (1949), ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957), ""Mash"" (1970), ""Patton"" (1970), and ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).  I don't include ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and ""The Great Escape"" (1963) since these are essentially prison films rather than ""war"" films.

In many respects, ""GI Joe"" is a companion piece to Wellman's ""Battleground"" (1949) made 4 years later. Both follow a unit and both are essentially character studies on men in war, rather than ""war films"" per se. The TV series ""Combat"" (1962-7) would adopt this format and subsequent films like ""Platoon"" would follow it (BTW- ""Battleground"" writer Robert Pirosh created the ""Combat"" series). The biggest distinction between ""Battleground"" and ""GI Joe"" is the use of actors - ""Battleground"" is a star studded cast while ""GI Joe"" uses actual soldiers.

Anyone who likes a good war film will enjoy this film, and beyond that, anyone who likes good character studies will also enjoy the film. Many of the scenes may seem like clichs, but here in 1944 they are being invented rather than re-hashed.

On a sad note, Ernie Pyle was killed in combat before this film was released.",1301702400,,4962,4.853254437869823
1081958,5,6305837406,"United Artists presents ""THE STORY OF G.I. JOE"" (1947) (108 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Burgess Meredith, Robert Mitchum, Freddie Steele, Wally Cassell & Jimmy Lloyd

Directed by William A. Wellman

The Story of G.I. Joe was based on the columns of Scripps-Howard war correspondent Ernie Pyle (Burgess Meredith). Though already past 40, Pyle insists upon marching along with an Army infantry unit during the Italian campaign. He befriends several of the soldiers, including commanding officer Lt. Walker (Robert Mitchum in his breakthrough role), family man Sgt. Warnicki (Freddie Steele) and would-be romeo Private Dondaro (Wally Cassell). The ""plot"" of the film is moved forward by the progression of the war itself;

Many infantry veterans consider The Story of GI Joe to be the single most realistic Hollywood war film of the 1940s, eschewing big stars, phony heroics and overblown battle sequences in favor of the everyday trials and tribulations of the humble foot soldier. Ironically, Pyle, who acted as technical adviser when he wasn't busy on the front, was killed by an enemy sniper shortly before the release of this film.

1082015,5,6305837406,"Wellman's cinematic homage to the real-life Pyle, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, has been called one of the greatest war films of all time, and it certainly earns that distinction. The combat scenes are intense and realistic, but the film also shows the humdrum day-to-day duties and concerns of enlisted men with an almost documentary-like fidelity. Meredith lovingly evokes Pyle's humanistic and devoted attitude toward the ordinary soldiers who were his subjects, and Mitchum - in an early, star-making role - combines grit with gut-wrenching emotion. Pyle advised Wellman on this treatment, but sadly never saw the end result: He was killed in action in 1945.",1182729600,,669,5.380952380952381

1082018,5,6305837406,"I love the infantry because they are the underdogs. They are the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys. They have no comforts, and they even learn to live without the necessities. And in the end they are the guys that wars can't be won without. - Ernie Pyle

  Newspaper columnist Ernie Pyle reported from the front during World War Two, spending the majority of his time with the common infantry soldier and most often reporting on their daily doings, Pyle won the Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for `distinguished war correspondence during the year 1943.' William Wellman's 1945 ERNIE PYLE'S STORY OF G.I. JOE is one of the great World War II movies made by and for that generation.  It's important, I think, to heed the full title.  This movie is very much Ernie Pyle's vision of the war.  You can find a number of columns written by Pyle by doing a simple internet search, and anthologies of his war reporting are still in print.

  The movie episodically follows Pyle (Burgess Meredith) and the infantrymen of Company C from their landing in Italy to the eve of their assault on Rome.  The low-key approach Pyle brought to his writing is duplicated here.  There's a gritty realism without the false heroics or gung ho attitude that marked most recruitment movies of that era.  It's an ensemble work, with Meredith and then newcomer Robert Mitchum (who was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Capt. Walker) standing out in a strong lineup.

  This is a movie made by, and for, the WWII generation.  The soldiers - your sons, America - are tired and dirty and somehow inured to the killing.  As Pyle wrote, and this movie captures, `every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion.'  They're shown in episodes that could almost be given column headings - The Company Adopts a Dog, Sarge Looks for a Phonograph, Christmas at the Front, A Marriage During War.

  STORY OF G.I. JOE is a wonderful movie that, upon release, claimed fans as diverse as Dwight Eisenhower (who said it was the greatest war movie he'd ever seen) to James Agee, who praised Mitchum `(t)he development of the character of [Lieutenant Walker] is so imperceptible and so beautifully done that, without any ability to wonder why, you accept him as a great man in his one open attempt to talk about himself and the war' in particular and the movie `(the) closing scene seems to me a war poem as great and as beautiful as any of Whitman's' in glowing terms indeed.

  Ernie Pyle died while with the troops in Okinawa, shot down by a Japanese machine gunner on the island of Ie Shima.  ERNIE PYLE'S STORY OF G.I. JOE is a fine testament to a great writer.",1109376000,13,2638,4.658008658008658
1082019,5,6305837406,"This unforgettable classic, based on Ernie Pyle's ""Here is Your War"" and ""Brave Men"", is considered by many to be one of the best war films ever made. Even General Dwight Eisenhower considered it the best movie to come out of World War 2. William Wellman, the director, initially didn't want to make the movie, but after a telephone conversation with Ernie Pyle himself, Wellman relented. Wellman later admitted that Pyle's pleas for the common soldier were so touching that Wellman was nearly brought to tears.

""The Story of G.I. Joe"" follows the beloved correspondant Pyle (played to perfection by Burgess Meredith) as he meets and becomes close friends with C Company of the 18th Infantry as they fight their way from Sicily to Rome in 1942 and 1943. Pyle becomes especially close to Captain Bill Walker (played by Robert Mitchum, in his oscar nominated breakthrough role). The combat scenes are brief but very realistic, and no one is safe from death on the battlefield (including the Captain).

This movie is an unflinching look at the daily struggles of the infantrymen, who struggle with the enemy troops and the mud. Wellman wisely used 150 veterans of the army's Italian campaign as extras, and gave some of them speaking parts. Unfortunately, many of these extras would later be killed fighting in the Pacific after the film was completed. And Ernie Pyle would also meet his death in the Pacific, killed by a sniper's bullet. ""The Story of G.I. Joe"" would be the one and only film he made that Wellman refused to watch.

Undoubtably one of the finest-crafted war films ever made, ""The Story of G.I. Joe"" is a lasting monument to not only Ernie Pyle's great coverage of the brave American foot soldiers, but also to the soldiers themselves, who loved Pyle more than all the other correspondants of World War 2. Perhaps the best line of the whole film is at the very end when Burgess Meredith (as the film's narrator) says, ""And for those beneath the wooden crosses, there is nothing more we can do, except perhaps to pause and murmur, ""Thanks, pal.""",1108252800,14,2059,4.794366197183098
1082065,4,6305837406,"Burgess Meredith is perhaps a little too beatific in his portrayal of war correspondent Ernie Pyle, the much-beloved Pulitzer Prize winning war correspondent who brought the stories of everyday American soldiers home to readers back in the States.  The Army infantrymen revered Pyle the way they loved cartoonist Bill Mauldin, who also had the guts and humility to slog it out in the mud with them, and let the folks back home know how they met the war with an all-American mix of grit, fatalism and good humor.  The production values of this movie, with distracting backdrops and obviously artificial studio sets,  don't hold up that well in comparison to the hyper-real war flicks that came in its wake, yet few movies have captured just how grubby, desolate and miserable the day-to-day lives of the ground soldiers could be.  Also, an extended battle sequence filmed in the real-life rubble of a recently ""liberated"" Italian town is remarkable for showing just how extensive the war damage was -- it was total warfare, and it's amazing that Europe ever recovered from the devastation.  A surprisingly bleak, if somewhat episodic, story, framing an iconic, groundbreaking war movie against which all others have to be measured.  (One note of complaint: the DVD version has shamefully little in the way of special features, just one brief clip of the real Ernie Pyle taping a news reel interview with a couple of G.I.s saying ""hi"" to the folks back home, and a series of illegible reproductions of old newspaper columns under his byline... It's really inexcusable that a full-length documentary about Pyle and his reporting was not also included... Oh, well.  It's still a good film.)",1041379200,6,1686,5.0
1082066,5,6305837406,"This film is one of the very best war films every made. The cast is superb and the story is gritty, down to earth (and mud) and captures all the misery, weariness and danger of combat. This movie has haunted me since I was a kid. I am so glad it was released on tape for a new generation of film buffs to savor and enjoy.
The film follows an infantry unit through some terrible battles, long weary marches, but mostly if shows that the men are human and suffer in many countless small ways. I recommend this film for anyone interested in seeing what WWII was like because this one (next to They Were Expendable) is one of the finest. The ending is a gripper, even after all these years and my own time in the service. Check it out, you won't be disapointed.",1003881600,4,757,4.227586206896552
1082067,5,6305837406,"This movie is the real deal. This movie is the story of Ernie Pyle, the famous war correspondent who won the Pulitzer Price. He was loved by the civilians, but the people who loved him most were the people he wrote about: the grunt. Most correspondents have gone to the glamorous Army Air Corps, where at least they got hot meals, hot showers, dances, woman, all of the time they were on the ground. No correspondents had dared to write about the average soldier. This movie, which I expected would be the typical chauvinistic patriotic crap, actually turned out extremely good. The action, expecually in that small town, is actually extremely realistic, despite the lack of blood, it is a good example of small town fighting. Much of the movie, as in real life, is not about action or gung-ho, it's about being freezing, dirty, hungry, stuck in a foxhole until you're called out to go on patrol, where you're thrown into the fray. This part takes place at Monte Cassino, where if you will remember was the sight of extremely bloody fighting to take the heavily defended monastery. Robert Mitchum shines as the intelligent, disallusioned Captain. Burgess Meredith is perfect for Ernie Pyle. A classic movie, suitable for the whole family unlike SPR, but still showing the horror and grittiness of war without blood.",996105600,4,1315,4.848888888888889

1082069,5,6305837406,"I grew up during World War II. My dad, a combat engineer, was overseas for three years, so the war made an indelible impact on me that lasts to this day. I remember sitting in the local movie house watching the news reels and wondering whether my father was there,was all right or would even come home again. I had friends whose fathers were not.
  He did, thank God, but the experience made me very critical of the typical John Wayne type Technicolor epics that glorified war and had almost supernatural heros and heroics. Those old black and white news reels, shot by combat photographers, showed the real face of war, its mindless viciousness, the numbing stress it placed upon its young combatants and the pathos of death and dismemberment at its most violent.
  I believe only three films about WWII caught this realism. 1. Battleground, 2. Twelve O'Clock High. and 3. The Story of G.I. Joe. If there were equally good films made about the Pacific theatre, I don't remember them, but the three above films I think will stand the test of time because of their powerful realism.
  The Story of G.I. Joe is about the 'forgotten war', the Italian campaign where the American and British forces had to slug their way inch by inch up the peninsula against well-prepared and led German forces who often fought to the last man. But the attention of America was focused on the Pacific and later, after D-Day, the northern European campaigns.
  Ernie Pyle, who is brilliantly portrayed by Burgess Meredith in this film, was the only reason that folks back home, who had fathers and sons in Italy, could find out a little, anything, about this forgotten war. He understood the American G.I. better than any writer that ever lived. My father said it was because he was up front, both physically and spiritually, with the grunts.
  Robert Mitchum, who I always believed was a vastly underrated actor, stuns the viewer in his sensitive role as a young officer who grows weary and finally fatalistic regarding the death of the men he leads. He knows it is only a matter of time for them all. His deeply moving performance alone makes this a movie to see. Tragedy at its best.
  I watched my father twice try to make it through this movie. He couldn't. He said it was just too real for him. That's a review better than anything I can write.",973814400,37,2329,4.62621359223301

I was particularly impressed by the film's use of combat veterans of the Italian Campaign. Watch the way in which a 57mm anti-tank crew places fire on an enemy position in support of the company's fight through an unnamed town. You could never get actors to duplicate the smooth, cool precision of that gun crew. The ending scene of the movie is a true tear jerker. The scenes of mud, rain, and filth are impressive.

The movie shows the hardships of the American infantry soldier fighting against the Germans in WW2.  There's some fighting in the movie, but mostly it focuses on the day to day, just trying to survive the war, the lousy weather, and get a letter from home side of things.  I thought the scene of the soldier getting on his knees to pray in a bomb-demolished Church sort of weird.  Nothing proves the God of the Bible more than a World War, massive death, and a blown up Church.  Robert Mitchum was good (as usual) as the infantry captain and Burgess Meredith played reporter Ernie Pyle (who was killed in April 1945 two months before this movie was released).
