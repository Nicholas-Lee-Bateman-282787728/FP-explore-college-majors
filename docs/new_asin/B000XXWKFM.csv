8230221,5,B000XXWKFM,Love Hell Girl and I bought this volume to help complete my collection. If you are into semi-dark anime drama this is for you. I would recommend watching a few episodes on hulu or netflix or whatever first. I think you will enjoy it and want to add it to your anime collection too.,1334448000,,281,4.222222222222222
8230222,4,B000XXWKFM,"It's hard to say that I'm disappointed with this volume but I really am. The episodes all told very interesting stories but ultimately it feels as though their only purpose was to allow Tsugumi to speak her perspective at the end of the volume. The shift back to its original form, which includes the torture scenes, isn't a bad idea but with absolutely no transition period to take the audience back the shift is just too sudden. While this volume will certainly entertain you if you've been enjoying it thus far, this series has proven that it's capable of much better and this is a poor way to start the second half.",1215129600,,619,4.535714285714286
8230223,5,B000XXWKFM,"Even though it's started to move in very interesting new directions, this series continues to be a highly enjoyable view. With the second half of the first season now underway, I'm finding myself filled with questions about what will be coming down the line. Shibata is coming closer to Ai but will her servants allow him to get any closer? Why does Tsugumi get these visions? Every time I watch this volume, I hit stop and instantly I'm thinking about the future of the series. While it's not quite the horror series that it was in the beginning, the new story has added some great psychological depth to it that I haven't seen in far too long. Very recommended.",1215043200,2,663,4.579831932773109
