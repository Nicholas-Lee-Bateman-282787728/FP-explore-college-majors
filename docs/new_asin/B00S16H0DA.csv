6938279,5,B00S16H0DA,Love this movie! I've watched it many times.,1425513600,8,44,4.625
6938280,5,B00S16H0DA,I can hardly wait to get this. I Loved the 2 part mini series.,1424390400,7,62,3.5
6938281,3,B00S16H0DA,"I read the book after seeing the mini series....and I have to say, the book was so much better. The movie hit some of the major points of the book. However, there were many characters, important parts of the story line, and the relationship with Dinah's son that were not shown or mentioned in the movie. And the ending...was not remotely what happened in the book. The beginning of the book, is the back story of how Jacob came to live with Laban. In the movie, that section of the book is very short. There's a WHOLE section of the book dedicated to this (Part 1 in the book). Part 2 of the book, is when she meets her first husband (which in the movie, it shows them meeting in the market place...that didn't happen in the book).  And finally in Part 3...the movie shows her reconciling with her father Jacob right before his death...in the book, she never spoke or saw him, once she arrived with her brother Joseph in the village before their father's death. Joseph and his two son's were the only ones that entered the tent, before Jacob died. Plus in the book, Dinah dies an old woman in Egypt, of which is not shown in the movie. The story line of Dinah and her second husband is very short in the movie...as in the book their relationship and marriage was much more in depth. Her second husband played a MUCH larger role in the book, than in the movie.

Overall...the movie was okay for me But there was so much more that could and should  have been done.",1424131200,69,1463,4.351648351648351

6938307,4,B00S16H0DA,"Of course, they took some license to make significant changes to the story.  I really loved this book.  The movie is good and provides a visual to the characters and places.  Some parts that are missing were missed - but that is understandable in a 3-hour condensed version.  I would have liked better if they had not made the changes in the story.  Still - it was a good movie (2-part).",1490572800,,387,4.394366197183099

6938317,5,B00S16H0DA,"This is a fictional story about Dinah, who is the only daughter of Jacob.  It is based on Anita Diamant's book The Red Tent, which draws loosely on the Bibilical story in Genesis 34.

She is not recognized among the 12 tribes from Jacob (Israel). The story is taken from Genesis 34. Take the time to read the biblical story before or after watching the film. Great viewing and eye-opening insight.",1475020800,2,329,4.771929824561403

6938342,1,B00S16H0DA,"This was just about the worst adaptation of a book that I've ever seen.  The acting was stilted and  the portrayal of the characters was certainly not believable as Middle Easterners.  Major plot lines were dropped, added or distorted.  A waste of time.

6938349,1,B00S16H0DA,".....you will loathe this film. The only resemblances to the book ""The Red Tent "" that this movie has are these. It is called ""The Red Tent"" , it has the same character names , there is a red menstrual tent. That's it. If you are a fan of the book, this mini series will have you literally screeching ""THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY"" or "" THAT WASNT EVEN IN THE BOOK"" or possibly "" DID THEY EVEN READ THE BOOK ?!"" .  Rachel and Jacobs meeting at the well? Not even close. The portrayal of Leah , not even close( her eyes are never mentioned).  Dinah and her husband meet? Nope,not nearly close. The birth and upbringing of Dinah's son,agaon DOD THE SCREENWRITERS EVEN READ THE BOOK? It seems like the Christian Patriarchy on a whole were executive producers of this film because the entire basis of the book,women's lives in biblical times ,their power and strength seems, to have been removed from the film by any means necessary. I want to find Anita Diamant and either shake her or console her (not sure which) for the atrocity that is this mini series. The video did arrive in a timely manner so ,the shipper os awesome for that.",1468108800,2,1130,4.401913875598086

6938365,5,B00S16H0DA,I loved this movie.  It gave a possible view of what women were going through during ancient times and how they learned to stick together in a male dominated society.

6938377,4,B00S16H0DA,"Being somewhat familiar with this Bible story, I was a little skeptical of the loose interpretation of Dinah's rape.  However, once I realized that the Biblical story is from a male perspective, I began to see things could have been as the movie portrays it.  Any loss of control over a woman's sexuality in Bibilical times may well have been construed as rape.  As humiliating to the men of Jacob's camp a ""rape"" of a kinswoman might be, a consensual relationship with a man unapproved would be even worse.  In the Bible Dinah has no opinions to offer on the whole affair, so it was refreshing to see an old tale told with new eyes. As a feminist it would be nice to see something beyond the purview of women's reproductive issues, but that is fairly Biblical, in that women didn't have much scope beyond family life.  I look forward to reading the book, since people rave about it.  I found the movie to be in the vein of a made for TV movie---many characters one dimensional, which is to be expected considering the vast sweep of time covered.  It was highly romanticized, but a visual feast, and so worth suspending my modern viewpoints for a couple of hours.",1456444800,,1163,4.535885167464115

6938385,1,B00S16H0DA,"What a disappointment. Found myself continuously yelling ""NO"" at the screen. The only reason I finished watching it was because the book was so highly recommended. Bizarre, unbelievable story-line that bore no relationship to the times, culture, or gender roles in Biblical times or the mid-East. There was no need to incorporate long, drawn out depictions of sexual intercourse. Is soft-core porn a hallmark of shows sponsored by Lifetime? Plucky heroine as fornicating harlot in love?  Happy, contented sister-wives should go over big with polygamous adherents of Warren Jeffs. Stoic Celtic and WASP actors cast in the role of Semitic characters. Learned nothing from this. Gained nothing from this. It's all marketing hype.",1454544000,,726,5.424778761061947

The characters were as dynamic and captivating as they were in the novel, and Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Dinah could not possibly be paralleled.

As I put the dvd into the player, I wondered if the movie could ever live up to the amazing book. Would the characters look and sound as I had imagined while I read? Would the plot follow the same path as the book or would the producers make creative changes? By the end of the film, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was phenomenal and the costuming gorgeous. While I will always love the book more--how could I not?--the movie was a great addition to bringing the novel to life.",1453593600,,640,4.254098360655738

6938397,4,B00S16H0DA,"It was eye opening in the fact that the word ""took"" in the scriptures; first, is not explicitly defined and secondly, as the commentator expressed, the account in the bible is a male perspective and does not give any information of her account of the situation. I cannot say that the movie followed as accurately the the verses of the bible pertaining to those accounts that are clear and defined, however, it does make you ponder on the conversations and secrets within the Red Tent.",1453248000,,484,4.705882352941177

This movie, which was made as a mini series, is unlike any other. It takes a relatively minor character who is barely mentioned in the Bible and gives her a voice for the first time, staying true to the original story while showing what it would have been like from her and the women of the Bible's perspective. It is an emotionally charged and compelling movie to watch and ranks as my favorite mini series.",1450828800,4,561,4.403846153846154

The actors did an excellent job, the movie was believable...as long as one didn't read the book as I did. The movie just didn't have the complexity of interaction between the characters that the novel did. Nor was the richness of the society there that was laid-out in the novel. The movie ending was vastly different from the novel and left me thinking I've just had a fine 'near-beer' instead of the real deal. Still, all-in-all the women in the movie were superb.

6938439,3,B00S16H0DA,"If one believes the Bible is truly inspired by God (actually an amazing account of historical people  with all of their  warts, pointing to the need for a Savior),  trifling with what I would call  sacred writings is  disrespectful.  Other examples of this effort are the  recent movies Noah (Rock people?? and a stow-away on the ark... really?) and the EXODUS, which truly was an exodus from the facts.  The real stories in themselves need no embellishment since they contain the elements that Hollywood loves to promote  ...betrayal, intrigue, violence, lust, hatred, vengeance, the supernatural.. So why alter the stories? Could it be because it is a subliminal attack on Judeo-Christianity? Placing accounts in  Scripture on the level of  fantasy that can be tinkered with, is to attempt to break down respect and reverence for Scripture and make it irrelevant. That way, no one has  to feel accountable to God.  I could really enjoy these movies if they would just disconnect them from the Bible. Change the name of Noah, to 'Bob Fights the Rock People', or something like that. The  Red Tent was entertaining and moving in places (excusing the feminist bent and excursions into erotic scenes). I loved the actors and the way they developed the characters. Too bad they were illegitimate portrayals of  real people, and if some of those people were alive today,they could sue for defamation of character. Some of the bedroom scenes were more of an attempt at titillation than story telling. I would have shared this movie with my family so we could discuss its departures from the facts and what we enjoyed about it, except for those scenes. Dang.",1435449600,,1652,4.913357400722021

6938514,1,B00S16H0DA,"The role of women in the Bible is oft explored and oft misunderstood. However, how anyone could call it minor is beyond me. The story of Dinah has always stirred my heart, wondering at what she felt. Was she raped? Did she fall prey to the charms of a foreign prince? I realized that her brothers were hotheaded, but did they do it because they were zealous for the honor of their baby sister? In this I did agree with the interpretation of the film. However, I agree for different reasons. First, to call her story a footnote is clearly a misreading as her story marks one of the most pivotal points in Israelite History. The oldest son would receive the birthright of leading the tribe. Rueben lay with his father's concubine and couldn't have the birthright (she was not his aunt in the Bible). However, Simeon and Levi were next in line. They weren't chosen BECAUSE of what they did to Dinah's family in law. To call this a footnote is to spit on their culture and what it meant. The other part that annoyed me is the premise that they have a feminine religion. Rachel actually stole the idol from her father because she wanted more children. The Red Tent was based on Jewish law and flies in the face of it being a living feminist manifesto. Further, I could try and see this as simply a different story but by any interpretation the Dinah of this story is petulant and as foolhardy as her brothers. She chooses to dishonor the father who has given her every privilege, ignoring standards of the day by not even informing him she was married. She allows a strange king to deliver the crushing news that his only daughter has married without his knowledge, without opportunity for her beloved ""mothers"" to honor and prepare her. How would even modern parents feel? Then when she is brought home by her brothers, she doesn't even wait to see what her father will do but immediately begins cursing him. He had actually started to berate them in the movie and she cuts it off in anger. She also berates Joseph who tried to help her. She runs off in a fit of rage from the only protection she had -her father. Had she stayed her son would have grown up in her care. In summary, the only time I felt for this spoiled, petulant child is in the tragic scene with Shalem and when her son turns out to be as unempathetic and spoiled as  she is. Finally, the smut overwhelmed all attempts at female liberty (or decency) by making the lead woman a sexual object once more.",1427587200,7,2465,4.441501103752759

It paints a picture of the beautiful relationship between mother and daughter, and significance of the Red Tent. I love this story not only because of how wonderfully it was written, but because it's so rare to learn about the women of the bible that were cast away in shadows long ago. I highly recommend reading the book first and of course the movie as well.",1427241600,4,659,4.491666666666666

6938520,2,B00S16H0DA,"So very wrong!  This movie is so far off that it was laughable at times!  I agree with another commentary that if they just made a story not based on anything else, then it would have been a mostly interesting story.  But to ""base"" it on the Bible, it is laughable!  First of all, the entire way Jacob and Rachel met and even the way he married Lead is 100% inaccurate!  Not to mention the pure fiction of a ""red tent"".  Jacob agreed to work for Laben for 7 years to marry Rachel, on the wedding night he switched the sisters out and Jacob married Leah and didn't even know until morning.  Jacob then had to work for another 7 years to actually marry Rachel.  It was NOT one big happy family of loving women/sisters.  The fact that both Joseph and Rebekah were portrayed as ""oracles"" is again completely wrong and just pure fantasy.

Dinah was mentioned just once in the Bible and never did it even say she went to Egypt or even lived past this event.  The Bible clearly states that she was defiled and then the king went to Jacob to ask if his son could marry her (they were NOT already married).  Yes, some of the brothers actually did trick them and then kill the men.

There some facts woven into this fantasy.....Joseph was Jacobs favorite and the brothers hated him for it.  Brothers did kill the men (because of their sister being rapped and being treated as a prostitute).  Rachel (not the other women), did worship idols and Jacob did make her destroy them. Jacob and Essau did have a falling out (because of Jacob) and Jacob was truly fearful that is brother would kill him and his entire family.

But mostly this is pure fiction.  Jacob's believe and service of God is completely missing and so is most of the Biblical telling of any of this! Again, if it was a fictional story set in that time period, it would have received a better review.  However, this is so far from any true account, that it really is laughable and forgettable!",1426982400,4,1946,4.4033613445378155

6938522,5,B00S16H0DA,"I have been waiting to get a copy of ""The Red Tent"" since it was shown on Lifetime.  Usually when I read a book I find myself so disappointed in the film version of the story.  Not with this production. The Red Tent is a novel by Anita Diamant, published in 1997, I read it for the first time in 2013 and fell in love with the characters. The book is more detailed than the film.

The book and movie are based on the Old Testament.  The story of the Red Tent is told through the eyes of Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob.  If you are looking for a Biblical accurate portrayal of Genesis 34: 1-31, don't count on it to be found in this film.  Read the Scripture first of the account and then with the Biblical facts in mind sit back and enjoy the story woven by Anita Diamant.  Diamant takes pieces of historical information from the time period and intermingles different traditions of Judaism and pagan beliefs of the time.  The intermingling of the story of Jacob and his descendants plays an important role in the story but it is the women of the Tribe who are in the forefront.  The acting is great, sets are realistic and the costumes are perfectly executed.

I am a huge fan of Minnie Driver and was excited to see that she was in the film. Driver plays Leah and Rebbecca Ferguson portraits her daughter, Dinah.  I was thrilled and pleasantly surprised to see Debra Winger as Rebecca.  She played the Matriarch of the family to the hilt!  The romance between Dinah and her second husband, Benia, played by Darwin Shaw, is a beautiful and really resonances as a true romance.

Remember the film premiered on Lifetime, whose focus audience is women.  With that said, Happy Grandpa watched it with me and he enjoyed it as well as I did.",1426550400,41,1743,4.386292834890965

6938527,3,B00S16H0DA,"The Red Tent is based on the love story by Anita Diamant, a re-imagined Old Testament tale of Jacob and Joseph. Narrated onscreen by a woman around them, The Red Tent focuses on Dinah, the only daughter of Leah and Jacob, who is mentioned only briefly in the Book of Genesis. Dinah was sexually violated by a Canaanite man claiming to love her and wanting to make her his wife. Her brothers brutally avenged the attack, but the bloodshed only caused more pain.

This Lifetime mini-series differs from the Biblical account in that there is no rape, just a love story, and there is no mention of God, so while there are still murders, their motivation is unclear.  With the elimination of these aspects of the story, the script is pretty much a sword-and-sandals soap opera. The big names in the cast are Minnie Driver and Debra Winger. Dinah is portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson.

There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1426118400,9,923,4.6503067484662575
6938528,4,B00S16H0DA,"A REVIEW WITH BOTH A SCRIPTURAL AND SECULAR PERSPECTIVE

****PLEASE NOTE: As you may see from very different reviews, there are several perspectives with which to view this work.  Please accept this attempt to describe the different viewpoints and help viewers decide if it's for them.  For those drawn to the movie with a scriptural interest, there are significant changes that will cast some characters in an unflattering light that did not occur in the bible narrative.  Some other events are reasonably accurate to the scriptural account, but feel a little barbed.  However, if you can, see also that the movie still projects a strong message of forgiveness and of female strength, honoring motherhood.  For those who love this movie yet see others are upset, please also understand that it borrows from a belief system and changes it in ways that can definitely feel uncomfortable.  For those who will hate it, I am trying to describe up front what you may find offensive.  It's ok to write one's own review, for or against, without being offended by other reviews that may differ on either side.

INTRO: This movie aired on Lifetime TV and is an adaptation of the novel by Anita Diamant.  Though it had the modest resources one would expect for Made-For-TV, it does quite well and has readily recognizable stars.  I would even say it succeeds in a somewhat epic feel despite the small screen production.  It is only scriptural in that it borrows the structure and names provided by the brothers who will eventually become the fathers of the tribes of Israel, and their sister Dina who barely has a mention in the bible.  It is highly symbolic through choosing Dina, almost a footnote compared to her family, and making her the focus of the story.  It is also highly symbolic with the ""red tent"" where the women go to adhere to their monthly isolation during menstruation and child birth.  It is also their haven.  I am probably losing some guys already, but there is much, much more to it than that.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  The story is primarily about Dina so of course it is fictionalized so they can flesh out her character and create the mythology of her life to fit the novelist's own tale (there is no life history of Dina in the bible, just a few mentions).  However, we begin by going back to Jacob and his love for Rachel, showing how Jacob secured Lea and Rachel (and a few others) as wives.  This helps in part to establish the symbolism and female culture surrounding the author's ""Red Tent"".  There are changes in the marriage motivations here that could bother some scriptorians.  We move forward quickly and establish the family of Jacob with his many sons who will become the tribes of Israel.  It begins to focus on Dina (Lea's daughter) and how she inherits her aunt Rachel's aptitude for being a midwife.  Dina hears the tales of how Rachel fell immediately for Jacob on their meeting at the well, and longs for her own true love.  Fate will bring her into the orbit of Shalem, the handsome son of a king in the city state of Shechem.  They are instantly drawn to eachother.  Those who know the scriptural account (again there are departures) are aware of the misfortunes that soon befall.  Tragic events will send Dina on a path she could not imagine and leave her struggling to find her own path.  The circular nature of life and the need for forgiveness are very strong themes of the story.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  I appreciated the positive messages embodied in the story and was moved at times.  Of course it can be melodramatic and it is certainly made for TV fair.  However, the acting was actually pretty good for it's genre and limited resources.  I think the actors were very passionate about this film.  To be fair, there are times where the changes from scripture felt a little harsh despite the positive tone.  For those who will be uncomfortable with that, I think it's understandable and the film probably won't suit your tastes.  Despite liking the film, I did think there were some changes to the scriptural story that weren't necessary to advance the author's intent.  If you are still interested in the very positive aspects of the message, I still think it's worthy.  Strictly for my own purposes, I chose to view the film as a secular story with an inspirational message.  I suggest a rental for anyone curious.",1426118400,68,4354,4.700132100396301
6938529,1,B00S16H0DA,"SO disappointed.  This story is NOT a true Biblical account - It twists facts and invents relationships.
READ YOUR BIBLES - Dinah was RAPED and thus the family vengeance...  Not just petty jealousy by her brothers...
There is no other mention of her in the Bible - thus, her meeting up with her brother Joseph as Pharaoh's right hand is pure fiction!
However, this could have actually been a fun story if represented as total fantasy - instead of using named characters in the Bible.
While I loved the costuming and the acting, the entire premise is completely false.
Don't watch this thinking it is a representation of an actual Bible story - you will be as disappointed as I am.
