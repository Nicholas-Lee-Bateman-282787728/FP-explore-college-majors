8535476,5,B002B6DMAQ,Loved this movie - but hard to watch if you do not want to cry.  Love all the work from both actor and actress.,1390435200,,111,3.625
8535477,1,B002B6DMAQ,"First of all, I love Kwon Sang Woo...he's the BEST korean actor ever! Unfortunately, if you don't understand the Korean language...I recommend not buying this movie because the subtitles are HORRIBLE! It's a bunch of random words so you can't even try to make any sense out of it. Not only that, their so-called sentences were incomplete. So now, I'm stuck with this movie because the seller won't except it back. Sucks for me since I had to watch it to find out how horrible the subtitles were. Don't waste your money!",1245542400,5,519,4.6521739130434785
