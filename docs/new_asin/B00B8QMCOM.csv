8564229,2,B00B8QMCOM,"I must say that I am quite disappointed with Amazon on this product, and it's twin: the Fabulous Thunderbirds - Tuff Enough. Both are on the expensive side, and they are the same concert, although you may not be able to tell that from Amazon's descriptions, which say that one has 12 songs and the other 14, among other things. The newer one does add a few more notes and a photo gallery. Both are in stereo only, and even the old 4:3 picture size (well, it will play just fine on an old TV!).  So, why are they so expensive?  I have no idea, but this is at least the second time I've been ripped off by Amazon's clever description pages! The concert is probably better than the 2 stars I gave it, but be aware and don't buy them both as I did!  Fools rush in and all that, I suppose...",1368835200,3,786,4.124183006535947
