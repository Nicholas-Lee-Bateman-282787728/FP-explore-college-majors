8750513,5,B000R7G6I6,"The ""Black Saint"", Billy Harper, is an amazing presence in concert!  The DVD captures the essence of his musical soul at his best concert venue--the church.  Try to catch him and the quintet if you can as he is so much more revered in Europe and the Far East than here in the US.  Billy Harper is indeed an unsung hero and black saint of the post-Coltrane era.",1194912000,8,360,4.264705882352941
