7895617,5,6305760659,"When Peter Jennings died this was a video I had in my collection and watched it because I was there in Times Square for well over 20 hours watching the celebration unfold. It was quite the event I will never forget to this day with the dawning of the Millennium. Thanks to the ABC 2000 tape I recalled all the moments from around the world as we watched it together outside the ABC studios in New York. I was proud of Peter Jennings' coverage that day and night plus we can't forget Dick Clark's countdown. As one of Peter Jennings' outstanding works, this was a classic! Thanks Peter.",1129248000,,585,4.425925925925926
7895618,3,6305760659,"It was alright, but I would rather have a full 24 hour version from beginning to the end. Myself, I didn't know that when I turned my tv on at 6AM, (or whatever time it was) that I would be able to start seeing the countries from start to finish celebrating or I would have been prepared with video tapes. I also am driving myself nuts looking for all the states celebrating. Why can't it all be put on one boxed set?? The full 24 hrs. around the world and our own States, like philadephia did a great job!.. very impressive, now I'll never be able to see it again. :-((( I've called the stations, getting no where fast though. Everyone wants to make money, but they don't want to give us what we want!. If anyone hears of a boxed set coming out, by all means email me lynda@ptd.net",979084800,2,782,4.22
7895619,1,6305760659,"This is a great display of ABC's talking heads and  not to bad display of American celibrations but lacked showing the Celibrations around the world. Since America was not the best celibrations I am not sure why ABC wanted to feature it.  I wanted to see the great music and fireworks and dancing,  not talking heads!...",957052800,4,320,4.678571428571429
7895620,3,6305760659,"This is a true rollercoaster of a video. There are actually two distinct videos in one. The presentation of the actual midnight celebrations is top notch. The Paris spectacular gets excellent coverage here. Most of the  other cities covered on the tape are presented well also. However, a few  celebrations were skipped or glossed over (Most of Asia and Africa,  Chicago, San Francisco, and Honolulu, fall under this category). I rate  this aspect of the tape 4 stars.
The second aspect of the tape is the  talking head segments. While I felt Jennings did a credible job of hosting  the marathon coverage, he was weighed down by several pointless, droning  guests and insipid comedy bits. Also, toward the end we get bits and pieces  of musical performances, which won't do much for you unless you are a major  fan of the performers. I rate this part of the video 2  stars.
Overall, I  enjoyed the video. If you watch it, have your remote control handy to skip  the dead parts, and you should be satisfied. I do hope that sometime in the  future a network will put out a tape of this unique event which focuses  mainly on the celebrations.",954288000,3,1139,4.63
7895621,1,6305760659,"Unless you want to hear what you should know about the new Millennium ACCORDING TO PETER JENNINGS, don't waste your money.  Fabulous Sydney celebration lasts 30 seconds, no Egyptian Pyramids, no Greek Acropolis,  London and DC last 30 seconds at best.  Dame Edna, who ever she is, and a  meaningless diatribe with Alan Alda take several minutes.  How often do we  need to see Peter looking out over a lot of people doing nothing in Times  Square?  New York City confetti at midnight looks the same whether you see  10 seconds or several minutes (this video) of it.  Neil Diamond, in a  Denver concert, is shown singing his usual tribute to America in full.  We've all seen that many times; nothing new.  Mostly meaningless dialog,  which was the filler between the superb midnight arrivals celebrations  around the globe, fill this video tape.  They lost the splendor of the  spectacle for the sake of Peter's politicizing.  If you're looking for a  family heirloom as I was, this definitely is not it.  I rated it 1 star  because the pull down choices don't offer negative numbers.",951696000,25,1082,4.771739130434782
