8216560,4,B000V5SJQQ,"The story of the kind veterinarian, Doctor Aybolit (whose nickname means Doctor Ouch in English), is told here in a comical, musical way.

Doctor Aybolit travels to Africa to aid all the sick jungle animals!..

The film was made in 1966 in (then) USSR, and some of the best Russian actors were acting in it, including Oleg Efremov (as Doctor Aybolit), Rolan Bykov, Frunzik Mkrtchyan and others.

Made with little children in mind, it's a fun film to watch for the whole family.
