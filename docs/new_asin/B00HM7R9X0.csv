8633434,4,B00HM7R9X0,"Not a bad collection of hard-to-see shows. The Beulah Show isn't bad, but it's horribly dated. But having Ethel Waters, Dooley Wilson, and Butterfly McQueen on screen at the same time makes up for that. The Ruggles features one of only two episodes that I think still exist (the other can be found in a lot of Christmas TV compilations). Again, good acting prevails with some rapid pace scripting - people actually talk like families talk to each other. Behind the Scenes is a good transfer, but the story and acting by the stars leaves a bit to be desired. Jesse White and Olan Soule are the highlights of the show. And Peck's Bad Girl is sort of like a female version of Dobie Gillis; Also a well-acting program.

While I wouldn't pay the outlandish prices that  most secondary market sellers are trying to foist this DVD for on Amazon, I'd pay the $6 over on Oldies.com in a heartbeat.",1472947200,,888,4.54375
