Infact the cast were very good and a great storyline.",1418083200,,187,5.064516129032258
8440102,4,B004SQFS2M,Maybe the other commenter got a bad DVd. If you stream this it is great. No problem whatsoever and a classic English film. Peter O;Toole said last year in one of his last interviews that this was one of his favorite films he ever did. It is a must see for any Peter O;Toole fan.,1388275200,4,278,4.072727272727272

8440104,4,B004SQFS2M,"This is a tale of an audacious Irish plot, to rob the Bank of England in order to help achieve Home Rule for Ireland. There are some interesting features to this film. First, it's in black and white, which seems to offer a grainy authenticity to the period. Secondly, Aldo Ray plays a rare starring role, with his almost predatory physical presence (he reminds me a little of a less lumbering Jeff Chandler). Thirdly, rats become significant because of their sudden absence in the vaults beneath the bank. Finally, is a very young Peter O'Toole in an early film role before he achieved stardom and international acclaim in Lawrence of Arabia. The ending has a good twist. The Scots Guards are the guardians of the vaults on this particular night. They march off with suitable, if brief, majesty in the morning. Did the Irish succeed? Watch the film!",1313280000,,849,4.743243243243243
