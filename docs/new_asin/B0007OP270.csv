8049716,5,B0007OP270,"Jane Monheit is the quintessential jazz vocalist of our time. Her exceptional delivery,phrasing of a lyric,and exquisite vocal range cause my spine to shiver in ecstasy at what I call perfect ""ear candy""- the ultimate audio experience one can indulge in. Her exceptional vocal beauty is a perfect match for her physical beauty,providing a harmonious blend of  both gesture and song-performed the way an artist would be performing it-like a painting painted by voice treating each song as a painting on canvas. To watch and hear Jane perform ,is to show reverence and respect for the way a song should be sung and heard- like a masterpiece.",1366243200,,639,4.97196261682243

8049718,4,B0007OP270,I knew that Ms. Monheit had a wonderful voice - but I was not prepared for how absolutely beautiful she is.  I have many concerts on DVD - and I have to tell you all - this is one of my all time favorites.  I am truly entranced everytime I watch it.  What a voice - what a face.  Amazon is offering it at such a discounted price - my advice is - BUY IT.,1281139200,5,353,3.6666666666666665
8049719,4,B0007OP270,"This album is okay, but not her best work.  If you really like Monheit, as I do, you'll want this one too.",1229904000,,106,3.8181818181818183
8049720,4,B0007OP270,"I just had to comment on one previous review of this DVD.

The song 'Honeysuckle Rose' was wriiten as an up-tempo swing piece by Fats Waller. Ella Fitzgerald sang it that way, as did Louis Armstrong and many others.  The song was never meant to be ""sultry"" or ""sexy"" in any way.

Jane Monheit's performance follows in that tradition. In no way does she 'butcher' the song, as one reviewer (a fan of Yes and Pink Floyd) suggests.",1146009600,12,428,4.461538461538462
8049721,2,B0007OP270,"Although backed by solid musicians, produced as slickly as anyone could want, sounding excellent (audio quality wise), and generally packaged (meaning Ms. Monheit, and the video presentation in general) as nicely as you could want - something just doesn't ring true here.

The opening butchery of Honeysuckle Rose starts the set off on an unusual balance.  With all the obvious over-marketing of Ms. Monheit's sexiness, it seems odd that this potentially sultry song comes off rushed and emotionless.  And this seems to hold true for the balance of the performance.  The vocal quality is unquestionably fine, but the sometimes overly-affected delivery and lack of emotional substance leaves me feeling like she just doesn't have the mileage and maturity to really connect with these songs.  It's technique and polish without soul.

There's no denying her vocal ability, I just hope that years and experience will eventually give her the credibility to present these songs as they should be.

Update: June 4, 2006

Ok Mr. Craig; how's this - Ms. Monheit's opening number, ""Honeysuckle Rose"", whether intended as an up-beat adhearence to the previous reviewer's preference, or presented any way you like it - still comes off as poor start to this DVD. The rushed and emotionless manner of delivery sets the tone for the rest of the set.

You read an awful lot about my musical experience and knowledge based off a few other reviews Mr. Craig. Besides liking Floyd and Yes, I also love Basie, Nat King Cole, Ella, Mel Torme, Buddy Rich, Billy Eckstine, Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Coltrane, Joe Williams, Monk, and many others. I've even seen most of them perform - as well as Yes and Floyd. All that demonstrates is an ability to recognize good music in multiple genres. How about your diversity, Mr. Craig?

That experience makes me comfortable in calling this performance from Ms. Monheit just want it is - ok, but nothing great. It's unfortunate that the state of jazz is such that this is might be considered one of the better offerings available. We can all hope for better in the future.",1126828800,13,2103,4.962962962962963
8049722,5,B0007OP270,"For anyone living under a musical rock, Jane Monheit is a superb, classically trained, jazz vocalist, who is among a new breed of performers (Diana Krall, Peter Cincotti, Michael Bubble) who are breathing new life into the standards of the 'Great American Song Book'. It seems the folks at her recording label, Sony Classical, have developed a winning formula for marketing this young women with the big voice.  First, they release one of her exquisite jazz CDs and then shortly after they follow it up with a DVD that has a live performance, that features a set list of the CD's songs. This was done in the past her 2002 release ""Into the Sun"" ,which was later followed by the DVD release ""Live From the Rainbow Room"". Now, the formula is followed once again with the wonderful DVD release, ""Taking a Chance on Love"". This is Jane Monheit, in-concert at the Brecon International Jazz Festival performing songs from her CD of the same name. Most of the songs have been culled from the great old MGM/RKO musicals from the days of yesteryear. She features the works of songwriters such as Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein and Jerome Kern. The stage setting is marvelous. There are silky drapes and dramatic colored lighting (though I could do without the giant neon, JM sign). It feels like we have stepped back in time to either old style, Vegas or a classic, splashy, tecnicolored MGM musical. Jane comes to the stage and with, that beautiful, muscular yet velvety voice, opens with the Waller standard, ""Honey Suckle Rose"". The song is fast and free in tempo. It is immediately evident, that this vocalist has picked musicians, who are just as talented and superb as she is. In other words, these guys can really cook together! They make up a small band, that includes brilliant pianist & arranger Michael Kanan, bassist Orlando Fleming, drummer Rick Montalbano and guitarist, Miles Okazaki. The set flows light and easily from Cole Porter's humorous and slightly naughty, ""Why Can't You Behave"" to the serene and emotional reading of ""Dancing in the Dark"". Other wonderful readings from Monheit include the lovely ""Showboat"" tune, ""Bill"" and the Porter standard ""In the Still of the Night"". I particularly was most moved by her version of Gershwin's ""Embraceable You"". She is join only by special guest Dori Caymi on acoustic guitar. The duet of these two talented people, breathes new life into the song and is just simply beautiful. Monheit has a light and bubbley personality, that seems to just light up the stage. She seems truely interested in getting across to her audience, how much she loves this music. Monheit has also improved her stage presence since the last DVD. Gone are most of the large physical mannerisms and the heavy make-up, that was a bit distacting to her performance. The DVD itself is first rate! Both the picture & sound are crystal clear. If I were an audio/video manufacturer or retailer, this is the CD I would want to use to demo my equipment with. It's that beautiful! If I have any problems with this release its, that the performance is just to darn short! Fifty-five minutes (the box claims sixty) is just not enough time! Your just groovn' along with this band and suddenly it ends, leaving you wanting more! The show ends with a very fast paced, somewhat rushed version of Jobim's ""Waters of March"" (the only song not found on the companion CD). But I can't complain too much. After viewing such a talented vocalist, performing with a top notch  band, all I can say is... buy this DVD! Highly recommended!",1110326400,60,3560,4.805872756933116
