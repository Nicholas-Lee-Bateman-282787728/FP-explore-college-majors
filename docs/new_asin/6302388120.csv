457213,4,6302388120,"Crisp picture and sound quality, this 81 minute DVD plays on region 2 machines with no problems whatsoever!

""When Comedy Was King"" features all the heavyweight comedians from the early 1920's and it is worth the money just for the Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy, Snub Pollard and Laurel & Hardy sequences alone, ones that serve to illustrate comedy improvisation at its very best.

And whilst this 1959 movie is made up of clips entirely from silent era films, narrator Dwight Weist and music by Ted Royal provide additional dimensions to enjoy the onscreen fun.

A very nice Robert Youngson compilation which no doubt will be deleted sooner rather than later, so grab it while you can from Amazon.com!",1193356800,5,701,4.923728813559322
457214,3,6302388120,"Let's talk about the movie first. I confess that I fell in love with Robert Youngson's silent comedy compilations with ""The Golden Age of Comedy"". The first time I saw it way back when on PBS, I was laughing almost non-stop, loud & hard for ninety minutes. (It should be noted that Laurel & Hardy were in almost the entire film, so that's to be expected.)  ""When Comedy Was King"" has only one Laurel & Hardy film, but it's a SUPER good one (""Big Business""). Laurel & Hardy are christmas tree salesmen who run afoul of Jimmy Finlayson, and the movie explodes into an orgy of reciprocal destruction. (If you're under 30 & have never seen a silent movie, YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO IGNORE THIS FILM. See this now!)

The film also contains a great short from Harry Langdon, as well as ""A Pair of Tights""  (a sleeper classic among silents), the Buster Keaton classic ""Cops"" (where Buster has to outrun hundreds of cops), some Chaplin from the Mack Sennett days, and a short from Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, who influenced later comedians like Curly Howard & Jackie Gleason.

I'm told that Youngson's films used canned music, but if it's true, it doesn't show. The music feels like it was made for this film, as evidenced by some musical ""mickey mousing"" by the composer. The music and added sound effects are lively & comical. without overpowering the films themselves.

As for the DVD conversion, it is so unprofessional, that I question whether this is a legitimate release of the film. There is serious artifacting for a few seconds during the opening titles, It's also apparent that the manufacturer failed to use a 16mm or 35mm copy of the film, and used an analog video recording. You can tell from looking near the top of the picture frame, where there is some color-shifting & distortion. The laserdisc edition of this film is of far better picture quality than the DVD. There are no added features on the DVD either.

Long story short: ""When Comedy Was King"" is a film well worth owning, and a fine introduction to silent comedy for newbies. However, if you're a collector, your standards will be much higher, and this DVD release will not meet those standards.",1151798400,7,2157,4.663157894736842
457215,5,6302388120,"Take a hilarious trip back in time with the great silent comedians who mass produced laughter and sold happiness in movie palaces throughout the land. At MACK SENNETT's Keystone Studios where the laughter began, CHARLIE CHAPLIN became comedy's biggest star. Sharing the throne with ""The Little Tramp"" were HARRY LANGDON and ""The Great Stoneface,"" BUSTER KEATON. Villains like WALLACE BEERY tied beautiful heroine GLORIA SWANSON to railroad tracks, while FATTY ARBUCKLE and MABEL NORMAND suffered matrimonial misadventures. There was SNUB POLLARD, the string pulling inventor, and the great EDGAR KENNEDY, one of the original KEYSTONE COPS.  LAUREL & HARDY brought forth incomparable humor from the mishaps of everyday life.  Theirs was a world of careening objects, uproarious sight-gags and high speed chase scenes, where ad-lib often took the place of a script and retakes were unheard of. The laughter will continue as the entire family enjoys the adventures of the clowns who ruled WHEN COMEDY WAS KING.",1130025600,,1007,5.407643312101911
457216,4,6302388120,"The Laurel and Hardy segments are the best. The final selection, ""Big Business"" is considered a comedy classic and probably their best short feature. Added narration and sound effects make this video even funnier.",1038009600,5,213,5.294117647058823
7825049,5,6302388120,"This compilation is as close to perfection to view  the art of  silent  film comedy  as one could ever hope for starting with the opening credits with {underated} Charlie Chase and ""Tiny"" Sanford puncuating the credits / narration with pratfalls and situational humor - this is one of the cleverest / funny presentations of opening credits  in the history of film. The great names {Chaplin, Keaton, Langton, Laurel and Hardy} are well representated  in addition to a  slew of talented funny men {and women}  less well known - Snub Pollard, Edgar Kennedy,  Ben Turpin  and Billie Bevan. And some surprises, Gloria Swanson {underplaying} and Wallace Beery  {outrageously over- mugging}  together in a Keystone Comedy {and married in real life !!} with both being upstaged by ""Keystone Teddy"" , the Mack Sennet version of Lassie and Roscoe ""Fatty""  Arbuckle and Mabel Normand in a martial comedy that starts out winsome and gentle and winds up into a wild slapstick finale.

EVERYTHING presented is terrific but three  {3} episolds in particular are beyond sublime - Buster Keaton's ""Cops"" with Buster being chased by 100's of them with some amazing  stunts, Stan and Ollie in ""Big Business'  as Christmas tree salesman in sunny California who go up against arch nemensis Jimmy Findlayson which is savagely funny and yet subtle and my personnal favorite ""A Pair of Tights"" with Edgar Kennedy and Stuart Erwin which is a perfect showcase of comedy timing, sight gags and situational humor AND of course Edgar's classic ""Slow Burn !  '.

While some reviewers have mixed feelings about  the commentary, music and sound effects - I loved them all and think they  greatly enhance the  enjoyment of  every episold. Espiscally poignant, touching and appropriate is the commentary on Stan and Ollie at the start of ""Big Business"".  Hooray for Robert Youngson in conceiving and producing this classic of silent comedy.  I give this an enthusiastic 5 stars - Highly recommended.",1446076800,2,1965,5.046728971962617

7825055,5,6302388120,"An essential film

This is the second of 8 compilations constructed by Robert Youngson in the late 1950s and 1960s for cinema release. These films plundered a neglected archive (Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, etc.), and far from being a mere recycling exercise, they beautifully showcase a very special part of Hollywood history. More than that, however, they are key part of the Laurel and Hardy story, helping as they did to build a renaissance of their work.

Without Youngson's passionate love of vintage comedy, many early Laurel and Hardy movies would have been lost forever. It was with his efforts that films such as 'The Battle of the Century', which contains a glorious mass-fight deploying 3000 pies, were saved: when Youngson found the negative, much of the second half of this historic movie was close to ruin. Other films were better preserved, and Youngson took care always to use the original negatives. Since most had lain unseen in decades, the freshness and pristine quality of the prints all contributed to the serious critical re-evaluation of Laurel and Hardy's work. Their magnificent two reel films from the thirties were also playing to large audiences on television, and suddenly Stan and Ollie were stars again. This much-deserved upsurge in their fortunes included a long overdue honorary Academy Award.

'When Comedy Was King' also features essential work by Chaplin, Keaton, Harry Langdon, the Keystone Cops, Charlie Chase, Edgar Kennedy, the Mack Sennett Girls and the wonderful Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Youngson's style was to carefully blend forgotten classics mixed with the lesser known and even downright obscure. This DVD is currently pretty rare considering its quality, and anyone with a keen interest in Hollywood's golden age should buy it.

The films in the Robert Youngson series are: The Golden Age of Comedy (1958); When Comedy Was King (1960); Days of Thrills and Laughter (1961); Thirty Years of Fun (1962); MGM's Big Parade of Laughs (1964); Laurel and Hardy's Laughing Twenties (1965); The Further Perils of Laurel and Hardy (1967); and Four Clowns (1970).",1328659200,5,2107,5.188235294117647

7825057,5,6302388120,"Robert Youngson made several documentaries on the old time film comedians. The 1st one, ""The Golden Age of Comedy"", is probably the best
one, but ""When Comedy Was King"" is also excellent.
It is made up of clips from many different silent comedies with a running commentary that serves to enhance the comedic value of the
clips.
Covers Charlie Chase, Laurel & Hardy, and many other big name comedians of the silent era.
