7743906,5,B01F5ZY3JI,This was a wonderfully well written story. I cried for two days and was just a wreck as if I had experienced this romance myself. I understood both sides of the story & felt for all the characters involved. I will read other books from this author because of how I was drawn right into the book. I hope the movie does this book justice.,1464739200,16,336,4.184615384615385
7743907,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I Can tell just from this short trailer and the tears in my eyes already that I am going to LOVE this!  Finally someone is creating and making high quality movies that have depth and real life meaning.  Been so sick of the shallow shoot em' up, sex, drugs and filth.  I am looking forward to this movie and others like it and thank the producers and all that made this a possibility and reality.  I speak for myself and possibly many others that agree....these kinds of movies are greatly appreciated and enjoyed.",1464739200,12,513,4.483870967741935

7743910,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I adored this movie. Laughter & tears, hope & despair, love & loss, these are the bread and butter of life.

I've read many reviews on here about how quadriplegics/special needs are being portrayed, and to me, this shows what is wrong w/ society these days. Not every person's experiences, or thoughts, are going to match yours. Not everyone wants to keep fighting.
 I'm bipolar, and while i put on a happy face, and crack jokes, I have been suicidal (when depressed and manic) for most of my life. I have chosen to keep pushing through, not because I value my life, but because I value my family and do not want to hurt them that way. But that is MY choice, and I'm strong enough to keep pushing as long as they're here... I hope.  I've lost several friends to suicide, and yes I mourn them, but I've never had the reaction most do. I do not get angry at them, rail against them, blame myself or others, or become bitter and hateful. Human life is not sacrosanct, and I don't understand how so many people can be so selfish as to expect another person to suffer through so much pain until they just expire.
Everyone reacts to life's challenges differently - some rally and fight through until the very end - some fight for a time and grow tired - others choose to just end it on their terms. If you're still reading, you can see that I have strong opinions about this. I could keep going, but no one really cares about my feelings on the matter, and I'm not going to change anyone's mind here. But really, wouldn't life be better is we all just kept ourselves out of everyone else's business, and stopped telling each other how to live their lives?",1537315200,,1649,4.382352941176471
7743911,1,B01F5ZY3JI,It's really awful and disturbing. Do not watch unless euthanasia is your thing.,1537228800,,79,5.153846153846154
7743912,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Absolutely amazing movie, it has such a deep meaning to it and I love how undeniably realistic they made this. It isn't exactly your everyday life kind of movie but it isn't too romanticized kind of love either. I love it. It's so good that I don't have enough words to describe it.",1537228800,,282,4.339622641509434

7743916,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Bring your tissues, guys (and girls)!  Seriously, this is a lovely, touching, beautiful movie.  It makes for a great date night.  This movie is very well cast, written, and acted.  It'll bring genuine, easy smiles and laughter;  and genuine moist eyes as well.  Bonus was a rich, touching musical score.  This movie is at worst a 4.8/5.  Well worth our time, and yours.",1536883200,,369,4.746031746031746
7743917,5,B01F5ZY3JI,This is truly the story of the power of an open heart.,1536883200,,54,3.5833333333333335
7743918,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"It is a great movie to watch alone or with company.  It will make you laugh, cry and inspire, this reminds me that not everything is life is fair or that would happen the way I wish for, maybe never - enjoy the moment ! - Loved it !",1536883200,,232,3.7346938775510203
7743919,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie is a little corny, but romantic and sad as well. The acting is fine, and yes the ending is controversial, but if we always had a happy ending, it would not be very realistic. I understand why quadrapelegics and their advocates would get pissed about this movie. I get it. I am not paralyzed but I do know what it's like to be in constant suffering, to be limited in life, and I've considered ending it many times as a result.

The character in the movie made a choice; it was his choice and his choice alone. He does not represent all those in his position, and he makes that clear. There are movies about depressed people who end their lives. It's sad, but ultimately it is their choice. We all like happy endings and this is not one of them. But it does make you think, and make you feel compassion and empathy.

This movie was cute and quirky, and it wasn't bad. I probably won't ever watch it again but for a one time thing, I might recommend it. But if I didn't watch it, I wouldn't have missed much.",1536883200,,1016,4.231958762886598
7743920,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie is a roller coaster of emotions all tangled up into 2 hours. It will make you laugh, cry, fall in love, and make you happy over and over again. I have watched this movie about 4 times now and have never gotten sick of it. It makes me laugh and cry the same as it did the first time. Truly amazing real and raw love story. 10/10 recommend!",1536883200,,349,4.0
7743921,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"My favorite seen, although there is a lot to like about this movie is when, Mrs. Trainor is introducing Will and Lou. Although he is being a smartass, it is hilarious.  Lou however doesn't back down. Either way, if your reading the book or watching the movie, several boxes of  kleenex will be needed.",1536883200,,301,4.555555555555555
7743922,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I'm pretty much an emotionless person but, it made me sad.",1536883200,,58,4.363636363636363
7743923,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I am confined to a wheelchair, but I am not a paraplegic.  Like, the male protagonist in this film, I long for the days when I was me, walking, running and dancing.  My husband's dear friend is a  quadriplegic; he was shot in the line of duty, a NYC Police Officer, 25 years ago when he was 26 years old.  He never once thought of taking his life, never.  He is often in pain, and often develops infections which he is not aware of until they flare up to severe proportions.  But, he perseveres.  And, his wife lovingly cares for him.

""Me before You,"" is a poignant, charming story of a young man who once had it all, a good job, a beautiful girl friend, a full, active life with a lot of friends until he was struck down by a car and left a paraplegic.  He abhors his life now, and is petulant, and morose.  Louisa enters his life, an energetic, chatty, full of life, beautiful young woman who gives his life new meaning.  She takes him on daily outings and eventually on a short vacation.  The two fall in love. She eventually finds out about his plan to end his life with assistance.  Louisa is devastated and cannot accept this decision.

I, too, find this decision harsh, and cannot accept it.  I think of Officer MacDonnell, a NYC Police Officer,  who was a paraplegic and lived his life until it was his time to leave this earth.  He came to the high school where I taught, and our students were so impressed with his talk.  He spoke meaningfully about family, life and his belief in God.  He received a standing ovation.  And I also go back to my husband's dear friend, the quadriplegic, who is still in a wheelchair and will live until God calls him.  I do not agree with the decision that Treynor, the protagonist, made in this film to end his life.  And I'm sure a lot of quadri- and paraplegics will agree with me.  There is a quality of life even in a wheelchair.

Emilia Clarke and Sam Caflin as the protagonists in this film are outstanding.  The supporting cast is also outstanding.",1536796800,,1999,4.35230352303523

7743926,5,B01F5ZY3JI,As sad as this movie is I really like it.  Feel in love with the charcters.  Clarks smile and attitude is heart warming and Will is soooo handsome.  I would of liked to see the ending different.  Maybe they should of showed more of the pain side for me to understand not more time with someone who truly cares for your daily happiness.,1536451200,,335,4.26984126984127

7743933,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"It is a very good rom-com with multiple small twists, insights, and good character development.

7743939,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie will make you feel a lot of things during a lot of different parts in it.

I wish i could leave comments on the comments. All I can say is this movie isn't all cut and dry as a lot of these very critical ppl would like you to believe. There are a lot of moving parts in this story and if you fixate on one key point you are libel to miss the whole meaning behind the story. There are many situations going on in this movie. You have someone who lived a lavish lifestyle only to have it taken away in a tragic accident and have something new come along later on in its place, in what they feel is the butt end of their life as it is now. You have 2 parents tryin desperately to hold on to their child whom suffers every day in silence but then acts out for the most part with his resentments over the lifestyle they lost and how they are supposed to live now. And then you have a person who seems to always smile through even the worst  of situations and feel the pressure to do what's best to help their family, never really stepping out of that box to experience life for all its worth. Its not until they meet the other ppl do they start to see what awaits them beyond the small corner of the world they live in. To be honest I think the only selfish person in this movie was Lou's boyfriend, he was so self absorbed that he never really paid attention to who she was and the things that intrested her, it wasn't until he felt his place in her heart was being threatened by another, did he even try to understand her and the end walked away from her.

I don't think ppl just come into our lives by chance. They come either to teach us or learn from us, always leaving us a little more different then we were b4 they came into our lives. Ever person that enters our lives plays a role that will help us determine which path we will take in our journey in life.

In the end even though his path did not change, his reasons for taking did. What was once selfish reasons became unselfish ones. He felt it was self sacrifice in the hopes that the one he loved would break out her shell and experience everything she desired. He felt that would never happen if she spent her life waitin on him watchin him die slowly and painfully. He felt he was saving her and his parents from a slow death of their own, at least with him gone he'd hope the start to live again for themselves.

We all say we would never until faced with the situation ourselves. No one can really say what they would do until faced with that decision to make. We judge too easily as human beings never really taking the time to really see things from all angles.

I suggest watching this movie more then once and paying closer attention each time to everyones role so that you can get a clear picture of what's unfolding.",1535673600,,2797,4.141804788213628
7743940,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"I enjoyed the movie it is a great love story, but I didn't know it would have a sad ending. Kinda pissed that I'm so emotional right now.",1535500800,,137,3.9285714285714284
7743941,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I cried on and off the entire movie yet it was so good.  Having given a child up for adoption, I know how it is to let go of someone we love for their best interests.  Definitely will be watching again.",1535328000,,202,3.902439024390244
7743942,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"I'm very picky about my book-to-movie adaptations, but this one was almost there. I liked all the actors, and they followed the storyline pretty well. Like the book, it broke my heart. Like the book, I'll probably never revisit it again. The soundtrack was very, very good, and so was the acting.

SPOILERS

For the 10 % who are leaving negative reviews based on the topic of suicide alone, you've missed the entire point of the movie (and book). The point is NOT that people who are disabled deserve to die. The point of the movie is that we all impact others's lives, for better or for worse, and that love is more powerful than death. Love is the whole point of living. And guess what? We all die. Every one of us. If a ""fictional"" person decides that they want to live and die on their own terms, that is their ""fictional"" choice.

Look at all these people, pandering a modern book for using the same themes that are in many books that are considered ""classics""! Honestly.",1535241600,,976,4.47191011235955

Emilia Clark spends 80% of the film with a gaping smile on her face and the other 20% sobbing. This woman's eyebrows are like windshield wipers, up down up down, they never rest in between. And the main dude also sucks. He supposed to be a grumpy, hard-to-crack type, and there is just no way the dialogue or the delivery of the dialogue could be worse.

I've read the book twice; year's apart. The first time I hated the ending and thought Will Traynor was a selfish person. The second time reading it I realized I was the selfish one by wanting Will Traynor to live.
The book stirs emotions in you because it makes you confront such a touchy subject; the right to die. The movie is just a sappy love story with a tragic ending.
Sadly, the movie doesn't deliver and falls flat; it leaves out important details while adding scenes that weren't in the book and I thought unnecessary as it brought nothing to the film.
The only redeeming quality of this movie was Sam Claflin and his portrayal of Will Traynor. He did an excellent job.

Nevermind the real life stories of those who have been killed against their will under the guise of legalised suicide, or the message that the lives of those who are disabled are worth less than those who aren't, or any of the other numerous atrocities that legalised suicide has produced.

Having said that, it's a sweet and funny story about a woman with a big heart and a man who desperately needs the light she brings into his life. It doesn't pretend that love is a magic wand that can fix everything, and it doesn't preach about ""right"" or ""wrong."" Not all love stories have happy endings. Given the situation before these two, this one ended just about as well as it could have, and while it left me sad, it was somehow hopeful and sweet, too.

THIS however, should never have happened.  They should have never attempted the movie.
Emilia Clarke may be known and liked for her role in The Game Of Thrones, but she was so bad in this, I cringed.
She was trying way too hard.  Every scene she did, she overdid it.  Were I to meet this ""Lou"" in real life, she would have driven me crazy.
I think on her part, it was just really bad acting.  The director should have had her dial it down a few notches.
Emilia Clarke does not do ""bubbly"" well at all.  Unless she was supposed to look like a cartoon character.  Then, it worked.
It's very difficult to watch a movie when the main character is extremely annoying.
I'm guessing Clarke wanted to completely remove herself from GOT and keep audiences from thinking about dragons.  All we got were her huge front teeth and bushy eyebrows.
The entire time it seemed like she was channeling Snow White on crack.
Seemed too fake.
The book was wonderfully PERFECT.

I wasn't happy about the ending and I wish it saw a different closing to the story but that's the way the story was meant to be told. Emilia Clarke is an absolute delight as Louisa Clark, a small town girl with a big heart who by chance comes into a role as a friend and companion to a quadropolegic man who's outlook on life is a little grim. Clarke's on-screen chemistry with Sam Claflin (Will Traynor) is outstanding, you can't help but fall in love with them together. Claflin's performance is touching and beautiful, I loved seeing a vulnerable side to this man that may have otherwise not been experienced outside of the circumstances he found himself in. I was a fan of Clarke's before the movie and have just become a fan of Claflin's after this movie as I haven't seen him in anything else prior to this; I will certainly be watching out for him in upcoming projects.

7744351,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I loved this movie. At first I hated and was quite annoyed with all the quirky faces Lou would make but I got used to it and came to love her quirky personality just as much as Will did as he got to know her. It is a heartbreaking story, but it was so beautiful because it was very relatable in many ways. Yes it was hard for all of us to say goodbye to Will Traynor the charmer who could still make us all swoon with just a daring gaze and a smile. I don't know about anyone else but I sure got hot and tingly when he asked Lou not to go back to her room that night... I understand that it's not everyone's choice to end their life when they may still live out their days, but that is one's personal choice and I completely understood why he still felt it was something that needed to be done. I didn't want to say goodbye to him either, but he wanted Lou to remember him when he was still fairly healthy enough to go out and do those crazy adventures that she would take him on. He did not want to be handled like a child by the woman he loved and he didn't want to prolong the heartache that would eventually come as his condition was only getting worse. The best movies are the ones that don't lie to us and that really show us how tough the choices we make in life can be. They are also the ones that acknowledge that life will never make things easy and just give us what we want, no matter how much we want them, but that we should all enjoy and make the best of what we have while we have it. Movies like this make me thankful for many things and they also make me wonder what could I do to make a change, can I improve someones life or well being in any way, even if it's just giving a friendly ""hello"" or ""good morning"" to a stranger or buying breakfast for a homeless person. Lou made Will's choice easier because she made him happy, she made him feel normal and for that he loved her. He knew that she would be ok when he was gone because she had that quirky confidence all along, he just had to help her realize her own potential and to see how beautiful of a person she was for it and for everything she had done for him. People will come and go throughout our lives whether we want them to or not but in the end, ""We are meant to lose the people we love, how else would we know how important they are to us."" - Benjamin Button
I would definitely recommend this movie and say prepare yourself, because you will cry.",1527638400,16,2429,4.010309278350515
7744352,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"Spoilers, you've been warned. --- Watched this film on Amazon Prime. I sat through the entire film, enjoying every minute of it, until the last minutes. The end completely ruined it for me. The entire film could have been 4 stars for me. The end drops it 2 stars. I know it is just a film. But I just don't understand the message they were trying to convey. Or were they trying to give a weird twist to the story, just to make unconventional when compared with other romantic stories? I would not even dare to call this a romantic film. The end turns it in a big drama. So there you go, the entire film, thinking she is bringing joy and hope to his life and that he will finally start accepting and enjoying life for what it is for him, for him to still take his own life in the end and after all the genuine efforts made by her. It seemed selfish. Why would you put anyone through 6 months of doing everything she did when your mind has already been made up and it doesn't really matter what anyone does for you? If you are dead-set in killing yourself, just save her from wasting her time on you and let her carry on with her life. It feels deceitful. And then the unrealistic aftermath for her. They show her happily wearing his gift and in Paris. No one recovers from a loved one killing him or herself that fast. I know this first hand. Someone close to me and who raised me killed herself. It took me years, if not decades, to overcome the aftermath, the guilt, the what-if's. I was not able to go through this person's objects and gifts without crying or feeling some sort of PTSD. Why couldn't they just make it a story that ends with him making the best out of his new life, even if it wasn't with her by his side? I was very confused about the end. Fiction or no fiction, for some of us who have survived a suicide in the family, the way this story ends is almost disgusting, for lack of a better word. So sad because I really enjoyed Emilia Clark's portrayal. She's funny and quirky, so different from her most-well-known role from Game of Thrones. And those who loved him in the Hunger Games, well, you watch and decide for yourselves.",1527638400,6,2147,4.264705882352941

7744366,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Ive watched this movie twice on Prime and will probably watch it many more times, as the DVD or Blu-Ray will be under the tree for Christmas. Its a beautiful, warm movie about one mans choice to end his life on his own terms, just as he had chosen to live it on his terms before the accident that caused his quadriplegia. It is Wills philosophy, with no one pressuring him to end the life he considers to have insufficient quality to continue living it. Exercising free will, in other words, for those with a religious orientation.

I thoroughly respect the principles of people who dislike, even hate this movie because they disagree with that philosophy. But I take issue with their trying to generalize the movie as an attack on the disabled. It represents one mans philosophy and extends to no one else.

I dislike using Amazon as a platform for my own convictions and situation, but in light of comments condemning this movie and the reasons behind them, I feel that I should explain the reasons behind mine before further addressing the movie. I also have been disabled for years, but I find no threat or insult in the characters beliefs and actions. Hes speaking for himself, as I speak for myself when I say that when my condition becomes intolerable to the point that my days are filled with only pain and no remaining quality of life, I may decide that I do not wish to prolong it. Or, when the time comes that I reach that point, I may decide that my life should continue. It will be my personal decision, about myself only, not projected onto anyone else, whether he/she be disabled or able bodied. My family knows of my views and respects and supports the decision I may make some day, as Lou, the woman who loves Will, and his parents ultimately do. No one is suggesting that people with disabilities (or any terminal or interminable condition) should not continue living their lives to their fullest capacity if that is their wish. The movie is about personal choice.

I find it disturbing that some have so little respect for thinking that is different from theirs that they would denounce the movie to the point of suggesting physical violence against the screenwriter. I respect the way you choose to live and/or end your life, and it would be nice if you could extend to me the same consideration. Im not speaking for you and Im not thinking for you. Im speaking only for myself, as is the character in the movie. Some members of my family have polar opposite views on how they want their lives to end, but they do support my wish for a possible final action in my life. I support their wishes. The bottom line, whether were talking about real people or characters in a movie, is Whose Life Is It Anyway?

True, its a controversial and difficult topic, so some dislike the movie intensely. Others, including myself, find beauty in the strength and courage of a man who has decided to end his life on his terms because he regards it as an unacceptable state of existence. Those who love him come to understand and accept the reasons for his plans.

There is no preaching or attempt at conversion of beliefs in this movie, unlike many with a similar theme. It depicts how one person chooses to deal with what he considers to be intolerable circumstances. The character of Lou is quirky and vivacious, a delight, and makes what might be a depressing movie thoroughly enjoyable despite the sadness it unavoidably elicits. The parents anguish over the prospect of losing their son, a nightmare nearly impossible to identify with fully if it hasn't been experienced, is portrayed realistically and believably, without melodrama.

I liked the movie even more the second time I watched it. Dislike it if you will, but please don't feel threatened by a difference in beliefs. No one is suggesting that the disabled are to be pitied or are of any less value than the able bodied. Were all valuable individuals, regardless of our abilities or disabilities, be it in real life or in the movies.",1527465600,,4001,4.636107193229901

My mother suffered five years with stage four breast cancer, she was diagnosed at age 33. She was in constant pain, could hardly move, lost all voluntary bodily functions...Before she was a model, a runner up to Miss Missouri, spunky, and energetic. The cancer destroyed her body, but she didn't let the cancer destroy her mind or sprit. She was active in her church, she sewed little girl dresses and sold them to pay for treatments, was a loving wife and mother. I was nine, and my sister five when she passed. She could have ended her life, I'm sure. But she lived for her two little girls to the fullest capability that she could. Every moment she shared with me was precious. I am eternally grateful for those memories.

We are all given challenges in this life, some we are born with, some come to us later on. We will all know pain, and suffering both physically and mentally. But these are things that will make us stronger. How selfish of us to destroy the lives of our friends and family by taking our own- even if we are all alone in this world, by the grace of God, Jesus Christ suffered all things, we are never truly alone.

Hell, in my novel, ""Miraculous Persuasion,"" a woman defies the odds, and the smart-ass doctors, by overcoming ALS! Yup, happy endings for me. (Oh, OKAY, then....shameless plug, but the kind of thing Will & ""Clark"" would've eaten up! :-) )

The story brings to light ethical questions and inner emotional turmoil which most viewers do not want to face. And those gut-wrenching ideas are what give this story meaning.

You failed to make me want to live. Your love wasn't good enough for me. THAT would be REAL. This was the opposite of a love story. This was deceptive and straight evil. There was a hidden liberal agenda to this movie to normalize suicide. This is such a slippery slope. Are people going to be helped to kill themselves because life isn't going how they want it to?! Everyone has problems. This world will never be rid of problems until Jesus comes back. Situations can change. I hate what this world is becoming.

Eyebrows shouldn't go in four directions at once. She overworked them to the point where it seemed like her only acting was in her creepy caterpillars which I honestly expected to crawl off her face at any moment.

Second, a criticism of the story-line (spoiler alert): I found it incredibly creepy of the invalid's parents to hire eye candy to prevent their son's suicide. How cruel of them! Then I found her acceptance of his suicide to be inexplicable. The movie gave no particular reason why she was ""okay"" with it. Then her acceptance of it after his death was shallow and bizarre. Literally no moments of anger at him? Bitter crying at his selfishness? His commentary that the man she had come to love wasn't him was also cruel towards her. Him: ""I love you, you love me, but I'm not worthy of your love. Apparently you fell in love with something that sucks. I can't let your stupid judgement ruin your life.

7744615,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"The tropes in this film are disturbing on many levels. Other reviewers more qualified/experienced than I have commented on the portrayal of a disabled person being 'better of dead' (to quote one review), and I would here like to discuss the mental health implications of this film.

Will is severely depressed. His circumstances have changed to the point where he cannot continue much of his previous extra-curricular activity in the same capacity as he could before (I will set aside that he did not work a physical job and, as he tastelessly notes during the film his ""brain isn't paralyzed"" so he could have continued it). The changes he has to make in his life are difficult and I am not surprised that he is becomes depressed. What I take issue with is that the solution his mother comes up with after her son attempts suicide and tries to make a break for Switzerland to be euthanized is not to seek a mental health professional, it is to hire a cute girl (Emilia Clarke) in outfits that would make Miss Frizz of Magic School Bus fame proud.

A relationship can be a great source of comfort to those with mental health issues, but it is by no means an adequate substitute for actual treatment. Will is suicidal and the people around him (even his physical therapist, who, in the real world, would have insisted Will try therapy at least a year before the events of this film) seem to think that if that is his choice, then it's fine. The problem here, is that if Will were still able bodied, the red alert would have been sounded. ""A young, rich, attractive person committing suicide? Tragedy of tragedies! Oh, they can't move their limbs? Well, I guess they are better off..."" This is absolute hypocrisy. Becoming quadriplegic does not suddenly make a person impervious to mental health issues and the film couldn't even articulate why Will would want to be euthanized other than what essentially amounts to 'I can't do backflips anymore' and 'everyone would be better off without me' making it even clearer that the man is depressed  we would never accept this film as 'beautifully tragic' if the audience didn't implicitly believe that living a disabled life is inherently unacceptable.

I feel as though this review has become too long, so I shall stop here, but suffice to say I was not impressed.",1521158400,2,2308,4.705445544554456

The movie captured the book fairly well, but it misses some important relational ups and downs of Lou and Will in reference to other characters, I think, hence the four stars instead of five.

7744712,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"*Contains Spoilers*

This movie has some controversial topics involved and does not have a happily ever after type of ending - but honestly it's nice to see that it's not as cliche as a lot of other love stories you see.  It is a sweet, beautiful, and sad story, and it's a situation that is more realistic than people probably realize.

Louisa is a sweet, chatty, and cheerful young woman who gets hired to be a caregiver for Will - a quadriplegic who once was a confident, outgoing, active, man who had ""the perfect life"", but due to an accident, was left severely disabled, and has lost most everything that meant a great deal to him, including his girlfriend, job, and independence. Louisa makes it her mission to try to make Will's life enjoyable again.

One of the reasons I like this movie is that it is not a love story that gives you the unrealistic happy ending that so other movies give you.  Reality is that love does not always conquer all.  I know there are some disabled people who have seen this movie and were offended by the ending.  However, I have to say that I see this movie as being relatable to people - and not just to those who are disabled in a wheelchair.  I don't think that there is an underlying message that life isn't worth living if you're disabled.  It goes way beyond that, and not everyone's situation is the same.  People may call Will's actions selfish, but would you say the same about someone who has been in agonizing pain fighting cancer and decides to stop treatments?  Will is constantly on death's door, in and out of the hospital, weak immune system, is in a lot of pain, and has absolutely no chance of improving, and in fact is expected to only get worse.  Who are we to say that someone should be forced to live with that kind of pain and suffering?  Lou does a wonderful thing for Will, in that she gives him a reason to want to wake up every morning.  But loving someone is not always enough, and I can understand the reason for Will's decision, as heartbreaking as it is.

This is a sad story, but it does give a realistic perspective.  Get your box of tissues ready.",1519430400,58,2120,4.397435897435898

This movie does have the characteristics of an a-typical romance movie, but the real life aspect of this movie is this message: love isn't always everything, and that love cant always fix all of life's problem and difficulties. This isn't a happily ever after movie, but it is a movie with true feeling and it will definitely make you laugh and cry with the characters.

7744907,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Some reviewers criticize this movie to be sad, but that's what this movie was meant to do.  Though I agree that I prefer happy endings, this story hits you hard because it's not a happy ending.  Those who criticize the male character to be selfish and that he belittled the female character, what you are missing is the point of his side of what he believes life is about, which is live your life to the fullest and if you can't live it, it's not worth living.  Most of us may be happy just to live, but to him he doesn't want to be a burden on his parents or society or even to the person he fell in love with.  He wants a well meaning life, and if he can't have it, he wants to offer it to the woman he loves; he wants her to live a life that is meaningful and be someone.  As much as I prefer that he didn't give up on himself, I understood his point of not wanting to give up on her.  That is why he left her funds to get her out of her comfort zone and to live life to its fullest instead of being stuck in a small town in England.  So, in a way this movie does have a happy ending because he wants her to be happy by not being with him.",1517097600,,1142,3.8340425531914892

As someone who is a) in w wheelchair myself b) works hard to support people fighting with depression - both organic depression and that which overtakes many people who become disabled as adults - this is horrifying. There's nothing romantic about your partner killing themself because they think they're worthless.

If you are disabled and are coping with the condition and feel valued, then suicide is obviously not a choice for you.  Not everyone can slip easily into the mold of radical readjustment of his/her life.  These considerations aside, this story is yet another re-enactment of ""Love Story"" and its ilk.  Some gender switching and change of details and, once again, we have the ultimate tear jerker. On the plus side, there is some very good acting and fine cinematography.

The disabled character in this is rude and abusive to caretakers and those around him (another stereotype) and the beautiful caretaker can love him through his berrating behavior? There is very little about this that isn't a slap in the face to the disabled community.

But it becomes clear fairly early on that the quadriplegic male lead wants to commit suicide.  I had to stop and research to see if he does.  I couldn't continue watching after I knew.  I have a friend who is quadriplegic. She lives life better than most people I know.  Most people with legs and arms that work don't enjoy life half as well as she does. She blesses everyone who knows her. This is just not something I can accept.  Great acting -- horrible ending.,1515542400,7,576,4.480769230769231

I am extremely upset that they're encouraging people to kill themselves and even make it look positive, this is outrageous!
I honestly rather have him died of pneumonia than to have him kill himself. I agree that he can't be selfish and tie her around him but he's actually even MORE selfish by killing himself and have others live in regret of being his murderers, if I was her I would've chose to live by his side and regret that I gave up my freedom than knowing that I ALLOWED someone I love to hurt himself.
I am really sad that someone would make a movie encouraging people to kill themselves.

Now lets take another angle, what if you were born with disabilities, poor, and ugly, does that mean you should kill yourself the moment you can? I mean, com'on, after all only rich, good looking, and smart guys deserve to enjoy life? This is not right, there are many things in life we can't choose but life is one thing that we can, we can't choose whether we're born into a rich family, nor can we choose to be healthy but we can choose to make a difference in this life. If every time someone suicides over the thoughts of their life sucks then human race would've extinct already.

Not a kids or family friendly movie, and definitely not good for anyone that's depressed or handicapped, unless you want to encourage them to kill themselves. :(

7745183,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"I cannot tell you how much I hate this movie.

I guess I should warn you that there are spoilers ahead....

I hadn't read the book. I don't follow a lot of pop culture so I didn't know the ending going into it, but having seen the trailer, I figured it would be like most typical Hollywood romantic movies, but with the disabled leading man twist, leaving me with a satisfying happily ever after at the end. I was single when I saw it, so that's what I was craving. I saw it by myself as I typically have no problems doing that.

So for 3/4 of the movie, I was enjoying it as much as any other fluffy romantic movie: there were hard emotional moments offset my bumblebee tights. Neville Longbottom being a super runner awkward boyfriend paying no real attention to his supposed girlfriend offset by actual chemistry between the two leads.

Then in the last quarter of the movie, it finally reveals that the whole movie is a 2-hour-long ad for assisted suicide, and if you disagree with the lead's right to choose to end his own life, you're a bad person. If you don't agree that he and everyone around him is better off if he kills himself then clearly you're unenlightened and cruel.

Never mind that by that point in the movie he's already admitted that he's in love with the girl, he still decides to take the coward's way out: running away from the pain and work of life. Never mind that he's breaking the hearts of everyone around him. Never mind that he's giving up. So he can't go cliff jumping or sailing or ride a motorcycle anymore. Sure there are all sorts of things that he can't do because he's ""stuck"" in that wheelchair, but there are SOOOOO many more things to life!!!!

Can you tell I'm angry about this movie? If I had known the ending before I saw it, I wouldn't have seen it. I'm mad they got my money. I feel conned.",1515024000,2,1837,4.341107871720117

Critics of this movie say that they are romanticizing assisted suicide, but that is an individual choice. Unless you are suffering like this individual, or have been through the same experience, then it is no one's job to comment regarding that topic. We are exposed to the difficulty in being a quadriplegic, and how much assistance they need in their daily life.  I believe that this movie does a great job at showing how much he tried to be happy, but at the end his life was never going to be like before. He could have had a lifetime of sadness, or the short happy time he lived with the girl.

7745269,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"The five stars are for the masterful acting, and for the fact that intentionally or not, this story has succeeded in igniting serious conversation on some very sensitive topics of our day, i.e. disability and quality of life, assisted suicide, material versus intrinsic worth of a human beings, among others.  Spoilers ahead. If you haven't watched, don't read beyond this point.  Personally, if I had known that the story had such a horrifically sad ending, I would not have watched it.  In my opinion, fiction should leave us with a sense of hope, even against the most terrifying odds that life can present us with.  I researched the story a bit more, hoping for some closure, and I found out that the author wrote this after real life experiences had caused her to ask herself quality of life questions.  Her close relatives needed 24/7 care, and the news had just reported that a young English athlete, who had become a paraplegic after an accident, had asked his parents to take him for assisted suicide, just like Will did in the movie.  So, the story is inspired by real life events.  The problem I have is that the story follows the real life events to their full tragic conclusion, and ends without giving us hope in the strength of the human spirit. Personally, I want my fiction to fix things, to demonstrate that acceptance is possible, that things can (and sometimes do) turn out OK even in the midst of the most dire hardship.  I know that some people find sad endings more 'believable' than good ones, so I will not take off a star just because I like catharsis at the end of a story.  The story is charming until the last few minutes, quite thought provoking, after that. For me, most upsetting in the end.",1514332800,4,1723,4.604575163398692

I cried and fell in love with the characters. Now just a bit of advice ladies, don't watch this with your man, he will never understand. But I will say that in any relationship both people should inspire each other to be there absolute best and see new things. Love can change you, especially if it is TRULY from the heart. When REAL love is given it will costs you, but will Suprise you. Loving someone is hard, but the best thing you can really do for them is truly love them.",1513987200,2,621,4.183333333333334

Quadraplegics can struggle to breathe, develop terrible bedsores & other conditions derived from their immobility.  Stephen Hawkings suffers constantly because of his paralysis; any minor illness is life threatening. Christopher Reeves--Superman--also struggled every single day, but, like Hawkings, found some purpose to make his life meaningful. Despite all their riches and ability to acquire the best equipment and hire constant caregivers, they do not replace the life they had and want.  Imagine how it is for someone without means, without insurance, without a spouse or family.  Imagine how much that care costs the average person who simply cannot afford it.  That the US does not have medicare for all or even affordable health options is the most barbaric attitude ever.  A country that would prefer to sink trillions into wars and tax cuts for those who can afford to pay taxes rather than insure the well being of citizens who live in the wealthiest of nations is just incomprehensibly cruel, which is exactly why this film insults many people, those who know the real story.",1513987200,,1239,5.1393034825870645

The ethical issues raised were profound, and addressed simply and credibly, the implications clear and very thought-provoking.

The acting, locales, and cinematography were all top-notch.  There wasn't a wasted word or scene in the entire film- I love it when characters are drawn with such deft brushstrokes, e.g., Will, the disabled son, certainly, but also supporting characters, like Lou's sister Treena (Genna Coleman from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victoria/dp/B01N9I1J91/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victoria</a>) and father (Brendan Coyle, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B004KAJLNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-and-South/dp/B004EF65QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North and South</a>).  Finally, I hope you don't read reviews and have the plot and ending ruined for you, but let me add (with no spoilers) that the filmmakers could have taken the easy way out with the ending, but they didn't.  Kudos for that.  Narratively, the issues involved were highlighted in a much more effective, impactful way, I thought- less knee-jerk satisfying, but memorable and profound (and satisfying in a different way, befitting the complexity of the issues and feelings involved).  And had it ended the obvious way it might have resulted in even more criticism, on the grounds of a sappy rom-com trivializing a serious matter.

My aunt who is paralyzed from the neck down is the strongest and most inspiring woman I have ever met. If she would have taken control into her own hands and ended her life, so many people would have missed out on the blessing it is just to know her. So many people have been impacted by her, and brought to Jesus because of it. She is not holding anyone back. For this movie to imply that those with disables do so is utterly disgusting. I am angered to even have spent the time watching it. It could have ended beautifully, with Tim choosing to live out the remainder of his life as God intended, doing the most he could with what he was given, impacting others, and sharing his life with Lou. He could have went along side her through her journey. What an amazing love story that would be about sacrificial love. Instead, it ended with him selfishly taking matters into his own hands and taking the easy way out. I know it's just a movie but this just made me realize how devastating our world is becoming, that somebody would think this is an epic romance.",1510444800,46,1252,4.424242424242424

We grow thru our challenges, we have a ""blueprint"" before birth for what we need to experience and learn from, but we all have free will which is to be respected. I keep telling myself that as I was an athlete, professional dancer, contortionist, and did gymnastics, and now  my disabilities are severe and I have to pray to just get thru the day, maybe that's why I was so moved, I just don't believe that's in the grand scheme of the universe for anyone.",1510272000,,1075,4.429292929292929

Sometimes these unfortunate accidents happen for a reason. God's plan is not our plan but I assure you His plan is much better than ours.  His plan will lead us to eternal happiness if we embrace it.

There is no message whatsoever that a disabled person is an unendurable burden who should simply vaporize himself. Louisa and Will's parents and Nathan, who are most responsible for his care, love him and fiercely want him to stay. If the movie has a message, it is that each person has the right to make decisions about HIS OWN life. The character of Will is so well-developed that, although we may not agree with his decision at the end, we do understand it. The nay-sayers call Will selfish, a coward. Not one of them seems to recall that Will is often in terrible pain. Those who have had to go through this--and I have--don't ignore it as unimportant. He endures his new life. But he is never able to accept it. We might think to ourselves, ""He SHOULD adapt, he SHOULD be happy."" But that particular man, Will, can't resign himself to a new reality which he sees as diminished. So he decides to die. It's not the ending we wanted.

7745834,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"The two leads are charismatic and attractive, yet I cannot get past the terrible plot and ending.  I was invested in the main characters so much so that it was such a tradgic let down to watch this story dwindle into a tale about a man giving up on life, even after an amazing beautiful display of love and joy is showered upon him (more than ever) after he's hit rock bottom.
The movie ended so unreasonably selfish for me.  It seemed like the plot was riding on the wings of love, and heading for a great story of the human spirit overcoming life's inevitable trials and sometimes hopeless tragedies.  Then the film dropped out of the bottom, and for me, it ended tragically.

It takes time and patience for most people to learn to hold precious the little joys in life, yet regardless of their capabilities,most people can  recognize this nugget of wisdom, even after losing what they consider to be everything, and they too can learn to hold precious the joys of giving to others love and joy in return.

The end scene of the vacation all alone in Paris felt empty. It was as if the moral to the story was that the lead role got his way & gave up yes, it's true, a difficult road, yet still rejected his loving family & new found love.  The buying perfume scene was off for me, (sarcastic/hurray the rejected new girlfriend is rich now).  anyone that has had the opportunity to have been rich and poor, usually knows that monetary riches are not the ultimate key for a happy life.  There are also those persons who have wisely grown older, & along the way have  learned that monatary riches are not the key to happiness and contentment. So ironically, the moral of this story is to live impatiently for the right here & now, & if you can't achieve the dream, give up.",1507852800,3,1771,4.421538461538462

Although very sad, and I realize in some real life cases this could be possible, but I believe it give the message that the world would be a better place without their disability and I do not like that.  I wish it would have ended that anything is possible with love.  I know every movie cannot be a fairy tale ending with love and happily ever after, but I wasn't fond of the message.  With that said, I actually did like the movie.  The characters were played well and very likable.",1507248000,2,641,4.055555555555555
7745953,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Contains SPOILERS - so don't ready any further if you don't want to know too much.
This is not your typical feel-good or rom-com movie. So if that's what you are looking for, don't watch this movie.  This is about a person who had what he thought was the perfect life and it was taken away from him in one instant.  He became bitter and withdrawn.  Enter the strong personality of a woman that drew him out of his depression and anger, but could not bring back the use of his legs or rid him of the pain he felt everyday.  Unfortunately I know of someone who ended up paralyzed after a diving accident. While he tried to be strong and put on a brave face, sadly his body was failing and he knew it.  I think if he had the chance to have dignity in his passing, he would have preferred that.

SPOILER.....I've read some negative reviews about how if she really loved him, she would not have put on red lipstick and sat at a Paris caf after his passing.  We all grieve differently.  But remember, she was doing exactly what he wanted her to do.  She loved him enough to honor his wishes.  And he loved her enough to make her face her fears. I've had significant loss in my life.  With my frequent memories, sometimes I cry, sometimes I smile, and sometimes I laugh out loud.  I'm honoring my loved ones the best and only way I know how.

Now back to the movie - The chemistry between the main characters felt genuine and powerful.  The story line (though apparently hated by some) I thought was truthful and real.  The actors' portrayals of their characters was believable.  I could sense Will's frustration and embarrassment being in a wheelchair - no longer the man he used to be. But then I could see that after some time with Louisa, he appeared to truly enjoy some aspects of life again. I could also pick up on Louisa's transformation - taking the job just as a means to earn money to truly understanding the value of Will's life and love.

While not the happiest of movies, I enjoyed it immensely.",1507161600,4,2002,4.353099730458221

As bad as any other predictable film where one person (why is it always a man?) who has a disability, but cannot live with it, and ""MUST"" end their life ---- yes!

This film is exactly like EVER other film with the same subject: Wealthy man who isn't the kindest becomes injured, and then is a complete mess. He acts like an arse, has NOTHING to live for, but wait --- in walks a girl, a young innocent lady who will make him feel alive.

Even IF they fall in love -- he is DOOMED to die by suicide.

I felt like this movie was basically sending off the message that a quadriplegic has no quality of life. It also to me, was apparent that he struggled with depression (obviously) but instead of getting him the help he needed, the family just accepted that it was his choice and they would support him.  I fully understand you cannot help someone who doesn't want help but I also felt that it was pretty much unethical.  Also, if you read the novel, it is more detailed about her past. He pushes her to move past her trauma and that she cannot let her traumas define her, yet he is letting his trauma define him. It just wasn't for me.",1507075200,11,742,4.316546762589928

7746025,5,B01F5ZY3JI,This was an awesome movie. Emilia Clarke was brilliant and charming. I get the criticism and if there is a theme being patterned out there that says the disabled are better off dead then it deserves to be protested. But i can't think that is the case. What kind of person would promote that? I don't know if this is a thing for some disabled people but what i see in this movie is one man's choice not a suggestion to the world. If this became a genre then i would have a problem with it because i would feel like it was trying to be buried into the psyche of the world.

The story line takes you on an emotional roller coaster only to have the two protagonists fall in love with the main character taking his life at the end. WOW!! Its like falling off of the hundredth floor of a building. The character played by Emilia Clarke tried throughout the entire movie to convince him to save his life, only to have him kill himself in the end.

Sad, sad movie. There is a ton of emotional moments, with suburb acting skills especially by Emilia Clarke. But the writing is absolutely horrible, the script very poor, and the end was just plain bad!!",1506729600,4,598,4.486238532110092

At best you lose your license and at worst go to jail. Also I wasn't buying any of the love story at all. I had a very hard time seeing the line between love and the need to fix him and convince him.

ANYWAY, it's not anything about love in reality.  SERIOUSLY, he's a slick business guy who did these weird deals, and he was just laundering money this way and this writer tried to make something of it like that when in REALITY, when did you EVER hear of anyone coming in like this and getting the money.  Someone ran over him, and still he's trying to expire, and then the money transfer was quite weird when family members did not want to have anything to do with it like dirty money.

It's a juvenile read.  For post readers, it's not even worth the time to ""romanticize"" some sick thing like that.

Getting back to AMAZON -- ... fer real, i just saw snippets through, then they said it expires 9/23 like oh ok, i was like is it strict 48 hours, or the full day etc. cause I don't watch these as they started with FIRE only, then copied this download thing that GOOGLE MOVIE did, where you can call in, UNLIKE AMAZON, and say the situation for classics like Huston's KEY LARGO.

The movie made it seem like Will ending his life was a happy thing and that everyone would be better without him ""inconveniencing them"".  In my opinion that message is garbage! The character Will Traynor who was a quadriplegic had a girl that adored him, a loving family that could afford the best medical equipment and amenities to make his life as comfortable as possible. I'm sure it's difficult to not do all the things he is used to doing but how selfish to think that he has nothing to live for and to give to all the people who care so much about him.

7746165,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"There are some angry reviewers taking this rather personally and making some acrimonious comments about how awful it is to send the message that disabled people ""have nothing to offer and they should be pitied and are pitiable and the world is better off without them"". That is a very shallow perspective of what is actually going on in this film. I understand that some of them are physically limited or their family members are or whatever. This story is not their story. I am very happy that they have found enough joy in living to remain with us and I hope they will continue to do so because I am sure they are enriching the world.

However, they miss the whole point that Will could do exactly that as well: Will is not a character to be pitied. He is not a character with no agency or worth. On the contrary, he is outspoken and amusing and likeable; he has undergone a character transformation because of his accident that makes him far more likeable than the person he was before; and his former narcissistic egotism and self obsession is obviously paralleled by Patrick's character. We as viewers are meant to see this and recognize the excellent qualities that Will  has gained and recognize as well that he can become even better. The whole point is that Lou would have been happier with him alive and in her life and the world more lively and enriched with him in it, but he did not want to live in that condition. The fact that Lou's whole perspective and outlook is drastically different after six months with Will is a message that in fact Will can do wonderful things for others. But for him, his decision is internalised.  It is not about Lou. It is not about his mother. It is not about the world. The whole point is that it was his choice. ""Me Before You"" is not just a statement that Lou has been changed by Will being in her life, i.e. a different person ""before"" he came into her life, but it is also a statement about him putting his own desire before hers, if you put it into his own words, ""me before you."" It is not about how substandard it would be for LOU if she spent her life with someone physically limited. We already know that she would be happier with him if he stuck around. It is about the fact that he does not want to spend his life with her wishing that he could do so much more. And her attempt to try to accept this; to accept his decision or at least to love him while still disagreeing with it is also referenced in the title, she is not putting herself before him by trying to force or coerce him to stick around.

I do write from experience. I was in a very serious accident; it was initially assumed that I was paralyzed from the waist down. I absolutely knew that taking my own life would not do the world good. I knew that it would be a selfish decision. I knew that it would be hurtful and difficult for my family especially having had someone (an otherwise healthy, astonishingly intelligent and compassionate person) in our family commit suicide. And yet, the thought was in my mind; it was there as an option. Why? Not because I think I am no good to my loved ones without my legs, but because I would not want to continue on without being able to do the things that I love to do and feel so made to do. I was fortunate, the specialists say miraculously so, to recover. But the experience makes me better understand the nuances of the decision making behind assisted suicide.",1505433600,4,3428,4.359937402190924

HE wanted her to live for him.  I didn't see it as a happy ending for her because she got money.  He gave her the ability to have experiences she wouldn't have had otherwise.  She is living for the both of them.  She may as well have been in a wheel chair unable to go and do. It is perspective, it was his choice.

I guess? As a movie about suicide in general? But as the only Hollywood movie lately touching disability...with the most loaded anti-disability scenario ever...which glorifies the suicide...it's hard to devil's advocate for this harmful garbage.",1504915200,2,710,5.771428571428571
7746219,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I suppose I should begin with a spoiler warning in case you missed the headline, because I will go on to back up my points with evidence from the movie itself. I did read a couple of the negative reviews, so I wish to address some points made in those reviews first. The criticisms included that it was an ableist or discriminatory movie, that it failed to celebrate life, and that it cast people with disabilities as a burden. Also many people would have preferred a happier ending I admit to having agreed with many of their points throughout most of the movie. I was also hoping for a happier ending, but that is because I Identified mostly with Louisa and if I loved someone like that I would want to keep them with me as long as was possible. But then I thought about it from his perspective. I always said I wanted to be taken off life support if I was ever ruled brain dead. Partly so I can move on and my family can as well and partly so my organs could go to people who desperately needed them. But this is not that. A Quadriplegic could live a full and happy life: and many do. However, Will is not only a quadriplegic. He is one that led a very active lifestyle prior to his accident, yes, that is highlighted in the movie, but he also has a lot of pain We do not see the pain much because he hides it from Louisa. He is also susceptible to infections, and that when paired with weak lungs leads to repeated bouts of pneumonia. I am someone with asthma severe enough that I get bronchitis several times a year. And it is terrible. It is medicines around the clock and struggling to force air into your lungs and when you finally can breathe, you still can't function because the side effects last hours. To be clear, my illness is manageable, and I would not end my life because of it. Still, I have imagined it getting worse and I don't think I could handle that at all. I have imagined situations where I would wish to die comfortably and with dignity as opposed to in terrible pain. Maybe that makes me weak. Maybe it makes me selfish. I'm sure people will have varying opinions, but to me it means I can avoid significant pain and my loved ones can mourn all at once instead of being subjected to a long, drawn out illness, and then a death on top of that. Is the movie ableist? I don't believe so. I find that we see Will doing many things and as a result we believe he will finally change his mind...at least I genuinely did. Will is also a human being with agency over himself. We see that his mind stays incredibly sharp throughout his illness, with the exception being when he does not have the energy to be witty when he is hospitalized with pneumonia. He knows what he is doing and he has weighed the consequences. It is sad for the people who love him, but they come to respect his decision because it is his alone. Does it fail to celebrate life? I did not find it to do that. I feel that despite the ending it really was a celebration of life and love, but I can see why people would think otherwise. Does it cast people with disabilities as a burden? I think there are certain realities that come with caring for a person living with a disability or an illness. Schedules are different for caretakers. We do not see the financial burden in the movie because there isn't one for the family. They have the resources to hire caretakers and change their home to suit their son's needs. Will is luckier than he could be if his financial situation were different. But we do see the emotional toll it takes, particularly on his mother. I do not think the movie portrays anyone who cares for Will as finding him to be a burden. We see an emotional impact, particularly with his decision to end his life. Should it have been happier? I would have liked that. But then perhaps I would not have tried to see things from Will's perspective. The power of his final decision, particularly after it being unexpected, caused me to reexamine what I thought from a different perspective. The movie made me think. About what I would do and feel in many different scenarios.

I found the chemistry between the leads to be electric. Sam Claflin was believable as a quadriplegic. Emilia Clarke was expressive and endearing in a way I hadn't expected after only knowing her as a dragon queen. (I will note that seeing her meet with the man who played Tywin Lannister was quite jarring and it took me out of the movie in the scenes between the 2 of them for most of the movie.) The locations were beautiful and I found the camerawork to be different from the standard romance movie or drama. I am not sure how, but I am not a student of film either. I tend to prioritize overall story over aesthetics. I was glued to my screen throughout the movie. Every moment was used effectively and I never found myself reading the plot beforehand (which I often do when I get slightly bored during moviesI watch at home). Those moments added to the story with emotional impact. I had a lot of feelings and I cried for a good part of the movie.

I also liked how the movie dealt with the issue of living on a low income. Louisa first stands up to Will when she explains how she is not leaving because she needs the money. I found that to be a powerful moment and the acting from the leads captured its intensity perfectly. He sees her as not living up to her potential. We then learn that she wished to study fashion, and was planning on attending university, but did not go to help her family. This ties in to the theme of growth. Love changes people because they grow. When you watch this movie you watch two people grow into different people from who they were at the start. It really is beautiful. It also adds to the heartbreak at the end.

Could it have been handled better? Perhaps the jump to her in Paris at the end was a bit cold. I am not sure how it could have been better. I know the scene where he left her money so she could seize her potential was important. In that way we know he left her something and we learn he planned it from the point of the meeting with the estate lawyer. He loved her way before they shared a kiss. I keep the rating at 5 stars despite the slightly sloppy ending and pacing that can occasionally be perceived as off. This is because it made me feel and it made me think. It kept my attention and I love the story. I disagree with criticisms from other reviewers. I have tried to back up my opinions, but in the end it is only an opinion on a work of art.",1504915200,10,6487,4.280944625407166

But, because they did, they brought so much to each other's lives. Will needed to gain control over his life, a life that was mostly managed by others after the accident. His decision gave him back that control. Right or wrong, Will needed to make this decision by and for himself.. My husband died at a young age from oxygen deprivation to the brain. Considering his age, he could have lingered for a long time, perhaps years, in this state with no upper brain function--devoid of the life he knew or what it meant to be him. He never would have wanted to live like this with no hope of getting his life back. What I loved about ""Me Before You"" is that it reminds us of the joy of simple pleasures, to laugh, and embrace life's possibilities.

7746295,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Wonderful story of two distinctively different people who met through a chance encounter.

Trust, love, and bonding can take seconds or minutes to develop. Familiarizing yourself with a world that you've never seen before and adapting to it, then delving headfirst into the situation without having a moment of resistance because only your heart can control your decisions. It's intricate. You'll feel as if you were walking on invisible strings that may or may not snap at any moment. But one must still persist, for the sake of the other. Some will choose to linger, some will choose to cut ties. When the time comes for the final decision to be made, will you still be there standing right beside them and understand that this is their choice? Will you accept that this is what they truly wanted disregarding any personal desires?

This movie is about two separate people who individually led very different lifestyles meeting each other during a series of changes that will come to follow. The process of resistance to withdrawal until two people become close enough to recognize that life can take shape in any form, anywhere, but you must allow space to breathe and grow. Accepting these changes and allowing them to become a part of you ever after will build you in for a journey of a lifetime, with or without that person.

Without apology, I tell you now, I do not except faith in a world without God. I look around me and see marvelous design. There marches a host of tiny black ants invading my kitchen counter tops like a dozen brazen warriors ready to capture the food clinging to the plates, ready to rip the dried and crusty food from the knives and forks. There sits a dove on the power line, perfectly centered between both poles, watching the lowering sun and the golden sky, chirping to all the hosts of heaven that the weekend has come at last. And there rumbles the outer rings of a hurricane, ushering in the rain of heaven like silver sheets against the black night. Far above my head sleeps quiet galaxies filled with trillions of stars and planets and moons. Each galaxy holds within her galaxies upon galaxies, planets steadfastly orbiting their stars. Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand? From the genetic code that Bill Gates examined and declared a programming language far exceeding the childspeak we master, to the dog that habitats with me and proves every AI a fool with her self-learned ways and skills and logic processes, to the earth that spins around the sun just close enough to make life possible, all these are but the outskirts of his ways. There IS a God in the universe, and his name is the LORD Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the great I AM, the King of kings and Lord of lords, the Alpha and the Omega. His Son's name is Jesus Christ, and he is the Creator of heaven and earth and is the Savior of all who believe in him for salvation. He is the Savior who gave his own life upon the cross, not to escape a life he could cling to, but to give his live so that we might live. He said if a man would save his life, he would lose it. And the man who gave up his life, would gain it. And he proved this.

I though this movie, despite its godless take on human morality and sexuality and mockery of marriage (purity, fidelity before and in marriage), would not end in such a sad, dismal way. But if you reject the God of the Bible, then you reject the only world view that offers another outcome. You reject the only world view that offers hope, both in this life and in the next. You embrace instead the world view this movie offers, and all you have is this life. You'd better live it up, because after this life, according to you, there is nothing.

The Bible says that the Creator has put eternity in our hearts. You know that you were created to live for eternity.",1504224000,3,2839,4.312734082397004

7746345,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"okay, so I read the book because I wanted to see what the hell everyone was on about. It was alright, I predicted the ending and got it almost to a tee. Now with that said, I just didn't care for this romanticized suicide, I've would've read a teen paranormal novel instead if I wanted the drama and secret past about a once great human like Will and how the 'quirky and average' Lou comes to change his dim life. I don't like that we seem to think love will cure or help cope any injury or disease. It's just not real. I don't like the movie because they couldn't even give five minutes as to why Louisa is the way she is. It only took a few pages in the book surely it could've at least made it in the film other than a the second they seem to hint at *spoiler* she was raped and that's what stopped her from leaving her home town. Where is that development, without that knowledge she really is just a girl, with a twat of a boyfriend and can't keep a job. It's no secret, I hated the main characters, and please note, characters. Not the actors, they actually did a good job with what they were given. a Lou has been done every. single. time. in all of the romances that hit the box offices these days. And Nicholas sparks has been milking Wills for years, besides I'm not quadriplegic and neither is the author so we shouldn't have a say in how to portray that view. And I feel I wouldn't normally care to really say anything about it because the general public would attack me or just write me off as a troll on the internet who 'doesn't get it'. But what bothers me is that they accept all this. if you take away that fact that he was in a chair then it's just a girl falling for a guy she's babysitting. And that obviously wouldn't sell. If you want to actually see the characters having motive and reasons other than showing the movie, read the book. It goes by just as fast and is just as predicable but at least the characters are bearable.
But then, what do I know. I'm just a troll on the internet waiting for my school year to start.",1504051200,7,2047,4.158690176322418

7746408,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"I understand the people who have given this movie low ratings because of its ending. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it was very well acted and it followed the book closely. I detracted one star because the part where Will states why he wants to end his life is just not well done at all. Of course it was just as clumsily done in the novel, so in that sense the movie again stayed true to the book.
For those who didn't like the ending that involves euthanasia, I can say that I understand. Many people live with disabilities as bad or worse than Will's. But other's have not found whatever it takes to live on. Some have lived in unending anger or depression, some have lashed out at and hurt those around them, and some have ended their lives. Is it mental toughness, or lack thereof, that makes the difference? Is it selfishness, or selfishness that makes the difference? I don't know. I just know we all have to make our own way, and we can never all agree on what is the ""right way"".
This movie is just one perspective on ""a way"". It's well done. It respects one way of looking at life and suffering, without supporting or disparaging it. Enjoy it for that, and if you don't agree with the perspective, fine. At least you gave a different point of view an hour and a half of your time.",1503705600,2,1299,4.2631578947368425

What bothered me about Will's character is that he never changes, throughout the entire movie. Sure, he gets a bit happier in general, but he still pities himself the entire time. He never seems grateful towards his parents or his caregivers, or really acknowledges the fact that he could be much worse off. He could have been born into a poor family with many siblings (much like Louisa's) and then stuffed into a corner of the living room. Many people who suffer such injuries are! He came across as a spoiled brat in some parts. I can't imagine that most quadriplegics out there would be comfortable with this message of ""Life isn't what it was before; you're better off dead.""

Really, though, if it wasn't for that ending, this would have been such a fabulous movie. The acting was wonderful (Emilia Clarke is ADORABLE), and they had excellent chemistry. I'll definitely watch it again, despite my discomfort.",1503532800,,1067,4.731182795698925

7746491,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Let me first say that I utterly DETEST movies that make me cry. When a review warns, ""Get your Kleenex ready,"" it's an automatic expulsion from my video queue. Life has enough angst & sadness, without actively seeking heartbreak in books & movies. I want my entertainment to uplift and take me to my happy place. I'm sure that seems shallow to some people, but hey - that's just how it is.

I'd never heard of this movie and hadn't seen the reviews, so I thought I was getting a Happily-Ever-After love story. Without giving away spoilers, let me just say this isn't a movie I'd have chosen, had I known more about it.

Having said that, this was a sensitive, beautifully acted, beautifully written movie that I'm not sorry I watched. Until the very ending, I had no idea where it would ultimately land, so it hit me harder than it otherwise may have. Already grieving the loss of three close family members in real life, this movie brought me to big, ugly sobs that were both painful and cathartic.

I understand that some people felt angered by their perceived message of this movie.

I am physically disabled.  In the scheme of things I have it lucky compared to so many others yet I was still incredibly offended watching this movie.  The ending romanticised a view that has plagued our society for a long time and isn't a trendy issues so it isn't spoken about much: ableism.  The moral was clear, even if you have all the money you need, are handsome, have wonderful friends and family, have a beautiful woman who wants to be with you, you should STILL off yourself because you are a burden on others.

Writing on comments like this is not typically my thing.  It even took me some time to decided to write a review but this needs to be said.  There is always a reason to keep breathing, to keep finding joy and love every day.  I have been disabled since high school when my body started to slowly fall apart at the seams.  It was a horrendous trial for 15 years that I would never wish on another human, even Hitler.  Yet, I am still here.  I didn't ""beat cancer"" or survive a horrible car accident.  I don't use a wheelchair or have some visible disfigurement.  My degenerative disease is not trendy enough to warrant charity events and run/walks.  This movie continues to feed the machine that tells our society that if you are not perfect, you are a burden.  That, only certain health issues deserve attention and only certain people are worthy of love.

To a disabled person, this isn't a story of love.  It is a story of giving up and that your impact as a DISabled person is more important than what you have to offer the world as a human.  The story glorified Clark's attempt to make him feel like a ""whole"" human again so that she could feel self worth.  Why wasn't the goal to help him find activities that he was currently capable of?  Where were the months of learning to get around your limitations to continue to live your life?

There was never a team of nurses and health aides to help me.  There was painfully dragging myself to the bathroom and crying alone while I dropped the butter knife for the 5th time in a row.  How could someone be so careless to show the world that the most worth you have to offer now that you are disabled is your stories impact on someone who is healthy?",1503014400,17,2392,4.36734693877551

7746508,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"The acting was great but the story was really just blah. I honestly expected a few tears but didn't cry once because the message is absurd.

***spoiler***
It's not like he was medically predestined to die at that moment, it was a choice! There was so much they could have done together, so many memories that could have been made! I understand he was in pain, but I'm sorry what a selfish, pointless act in the name of love! Love is bearing the pain and living for the people you care about because when you die who will be in pain then?! How precious are the moments just laying together with your head on their chest, listening to their heart beat and feeling their chest rise and fall! All the fancy trips, money and good intentions can not buy back life once it is gone! And nothing in life will ever be as precious and unobtainable as that to someone who has lost someone! It makes me want to scream at the absurdity of the story! It makes me wonder if the writer's truly understand what love is! Why should she be the bigger person and graceful let him go? Are you kidding me?!

When she said she wished she never met him I'm going with that! Love changed us theme is stupid in this story! If he really cared he would have ended anything before it started crawled deeper into his pitty hole and died alone. He could have left her in his will, saved her heart and supported her ""potential""!

I'm not unsympathetic to people who with terminal illness and pain. My opinion isn't spiritually based in anything. I understand that many people believe in putting themselves before anything or anyone is most realistic. My review is based on this story and the way it was presented. So I'll say it again. He didn't have to die so soon and the absurd excuses are a slap in the face to people who have lost after fighting to live! Especially to say live boldly while throwing it away prematurely is such hypocrisy! Don't live life boldly, live it as if it's a precious thing! Meaningful, bold, assertiveness comes from understanding the value of life! The only reason I gave it two stars was for the acting and cinematography.",1502841600,4,2122,4.4498714652956295

Great chemistry between the characters.  I know a lot of people aren't too happy with the ending.  I think I wouldn't have liked it in my younger days because all movies had to have a happy ending before.  If you've read more than one review, you probably already read about the ending, but I will leave a SPOLIER ALERT right here anyway.  I would have liked the two characters to come together in the end.  Love conquers all type of thing, but I think the way it ends leaves you thinking more than a happy ending would have.  Wil decides to end his life because he felt like he wasn't really living.  Some would say it was a really selfish thing to do, but it's his life, isn't he allowed to be selfish?  I can't say I wouldn't do the same in a similar situation where I am pretty much waking up every day and wishing that I hadn't.  It's unfortunate that he wasn't able to see the positives in his life, but I can't fault him for his decision.",1502668800,2,1098,4.251207729468599

As an able-bodied person, I can't claim to understand what people in that condition have to go through daily, but as a person who has struggled with suicide, I DO understand that it is NOT glamorous and ""peaceful."" It is SELFISH and prideful. Taking a flame out of the world before their time is stupid and thoughtless.

7746570,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"In guess we all will disagree depending on the stage of life we are in and our personal experiences regarding the theme of the movie.  I didn't see how this film advocated for disabled people committing suicide and we are better off without them.  I found in fact just the opposite.  That everyone felt they would be better with the main character in their lives even with his disability.  I feel it showed how even though taxing and hard he was a human being a person and should valued and can bring joy to others lives just like anyone else.  I really believe the film was about the emotions we have to go through in tragedy and face the outcomes.  I saw it in the Taylor family, the young man himself, Clark, his friends, the health care provider and even Clark's family in how they wanted to support her and him.  These feelings are not easy to process over night.  They can take years.  It is an adjustment for everyone that is in circle around the disabled young man.  That is REAL life.  But if we have support in our good and bad days we can make it through the bad times.  And yes see that there is a possibility of good times too!  I think that is what Clark was trying to get across to him.  No, to me no one felt in this film they were better off without him.  I imagine many with altered lives in body and mind go through different emotional pain.  That is why we need each other and we need professionals to help.

I don't think that it romanticizes suicide, but it does bring into question human euthanisation, when it comes to individuals like Will, or those with cancer, among other conditions or diseases, that alter that individual's life significantly. Having taken BioEthics classes this is a topic that comes up frequently and ends up being a super heated discussion among my classmates & I, and for good reason.

Despite being a quadriplegic there were a lot of times when Will just comes off as a spoiled entitled idiot who can't seem to give up the luxurious life that he has lost.  There are plenty of people in fact most of the planet who can't afford to live his lifestyle not because they are disabled but because they don't have the means to do so.  So should we all be committing mass suicide?  It seems to me that because of the subpar talents of the writer the movie simply focused on the wrong things.

In order to access the service of an accompanied suicide, someone has to:
be a member of DIGNITAS, and
be of sound judgement, and
possess a minimum level of physical mobility (sufficient to self-administer the drug)

that ability to self administer the drug is how Dignitas, the organization illustrated on letterhead in this movie distinguishes ""accompanied suicide"" from euthanasia.

If you are an adult person who realizes that the pain and complications associated with paralysis or terminal illness can't be cured with a pretty dress and a couple of one-liners, don't waste your time.
This movie is a load of unrealistic sap and one-liners, ridiculous scenarios and outcomes, and it simply feels like it tries way too hard. You shouldn't just be able to take a fairy tale idea, slap a real-life problem on it, create a fairy tale solution for it and call it a movie.",1501891200,8,628,4.616071428571429

The assumption that people with major physical disabilities are better off dead is disgusting and abhorrent. The assumption that disabled people are a drag on the lives of those around them and if only they were gone, their friends and family would be free, is now the progressive lefts mantra.

It dismisses the abilities of the handicapped, by concluding the noble choice for this young man is assisted suicide.  Movies like this poise a great threat to our society.  They show a lack of faith and a denial of a higher power.

However she doesn't know that she is about to lose her job and that what's is coming will change her perspective in life forever.

Will Traynor loved life more than most people do and he enjoyed to the max, however a motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He hates the way he has to live know and he is miserable every day and all day long and he does not hide that from everybody around him, but he also knows what he has to do to stop all that and he is going to put a stop to it.

What Will and Lou is that both their lives are about to interconnect and change one another forever. Lou never realized that taking care of someone like Will would open up so many doors and change someone so much as Will has done to her and Will never thought that Lou would be the one that could make him smile again but will it be enough?

This book, OMG...I know so many people have been reading and watching the movie so you know what I am talking about, but if you haven't read it, please do it, because you will love it. I spend the whole book thinking one thing then another, never knowing exactly what would happen and the ending...it broken me to pieces and yes I cried like a river with this book. My rating? 5 out of 5 stars for sure and totally, totally recommend it. Maybe the reason I haven't gone and watch the movie is because I know how it ends and I'm still not quite ready for it???? But, I do want to watch it and I know that I will.

Despite the good acting, I didn't like the ending not because of Will's choice to die, but because Will's internal and physical struggle could have been more greatly conveyed to persuade me that he made the right decision.  Louisa's character stole the movie and my heart, and thus I rooted for her happiness rather than Will's happiness.

You are just a shadow of who you could have been and your life is not worth living. Hopefully the people that love you will not think about you too much after you are gone since it might make them sad.""  I disagree with this on so many levels.

It didn't fit that the guy would decide he wanted to end his life even though he was experiencing joy and living life as fully as he could under his new circumstances. Just because his life was different from how it used to be didn't mean it no longer had purpose. I felt that this movie made light of a heavy situation. In a bad way..

I also like that there was no or little nudity.  Bootie and/or boobies don't enhance a movie for me, and a film like this proves that point.  The pace was perfect.  I didn't feel like anything dragged or I wished I could've seen more behind this character or story-line.  Overall, it's certainly a wonderful depiction of real life, in that there isn't always the happy ending, the result you wanted, and sometimes it's out of our hands.

So I did, I must say I absolutely loved it the chemistry between the main actors was what made it I didn't see the disablement just the flow of how life it cam be for some and how they mentally cope with their disability. Everyone is different.
 I thought it was well written and played. This is why I gave it a 5 STAR rating. Do I wish the ending was different ""I do"". But not all movies have happy endings or what we perceive as happiness.

Sometimes Life has a weir/peculiar/and [sometimes] a scary way of changing someones life.  Sometimes Life does it in a way that is totally unacceptable to a humans feelings (understandings).  Life knows this.  And every time it needs to be done, Life will always do it (unapologetically) no matter the cost.

I will also like to point out the beauty beneath the change [Done by the Cost].  The same but whole new person that transforms into something magically extraordinary (I just love it!).

7746894,3,B01F5ZY3JI,"-SPOILERS-

Emilia Clark did a great job, her character is dorky and very adorable. Sam's role is a bit disappointing, however, and it is what killed the movie for me. He got in an accident... for a rather lame and irresponsible reason, talking on the phone and not looking while crossing the street. This permanently puts him in a wheelchair and give him health issues. Well... that sucks but it doesn't mean you spend the rest of your life moping and crying. He's still extremely rich and there's still a lot he can do, while at the same can do absolutely nothing if he wanted. I know people who have a a much harder life than him meanwhile maintaining a better outlook on life. This leads to the second issue:

He doesn't look like he's actually suffering. He's supposed to play the part of a man who is seemingly stripped of everything (not really) and is supposed to be sad, depressed, etc. Rather, he looks like a completely normal guy that decided to sit in a wheelchair by choice and when he met Louisa for the first time he was very unnecessarily and unconvincingly a jerk for no reason.

7746977,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie doesn't do justice to the story in the book at all. I know that  when books are made into movies they can never include everything that was written but in this case it's not only that they had to cut off parts of the story (some actually very important) due to obvious time restrictions, the main issue is that they completely  failed to bring into the movie the depth of the main characters and their experiences. The movie does seem to trivialize the whole situation, butchered essential elements to understand the characters and basically completely missed the point. The book is not perfect either, perfection can hardly be attained especially in such complex subject, but it is SO much more than the movie that I can only recommend you go and read it and skip the film.
*spoiler alert*  The reasons that bring Will to make his choices are completely lost in the movie. Independently of any debate about the right or wrong of ending your own life in certain situations, the author of the book did explore the different things that one quadriplegic in particular was enduring and why he chooses to die in spite of all Louisa's efforts to change his mind. Louisa's reasons for living such simple and wasted (in Will's opinion) life are also ignored as is most of the evolution of their relationship. The dynamics of the families and other relationships were either just chopped off or totally changed; in the original story there are tensions, infidelities, sibling rivalries, financial hardships, a past rape, selfishness, a self-centered and greedy boyfriend, doubts, conflict, all sorts of things that contribute to the characters view of the world and personalities.
One last thing, no matter what any of us might think about someone making an end of life  choice, I believe the story was just aiming to give the public a glimpse of the realities that people face when they have an SCI - such as constant pain, additional health issues, dependence on others, discrimination, loss of control over your life, etc (the movie mostly failed at this as well) - and of some of the implications when someone makes the choice. I don't believe for a second the author of the book was aiming to advocate that people with SCI should just choose to die, I think she wanted to tell a story of one particular person who made that choice which in the end I believe is what the story is about, the individual right to choose how we want to live (or not) our life, the strength needed to choose either way and also the impact that this decision will have in the lives of all of those involved.",1500163200,5,2592,4.677631578947368

7746984,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"I saw a superior movie with a similar story line a few months prior titled ""The Fundamentals of Caring"", so ""Me Before You"" didn't stand a chance when I finally decided to watch it.  Though the protagonist in TFoC had muscular dystrophy rather than being a quadriplegic, the arc of the stories were very similar, and TFoC has Paul Rudd.  Who doesn't like Paul Rudd?

While some people may enjoy this movie, I found most of the scenes as rather cringe worthy.  Honestly, I spent most of the movie debating whether or not I could finish it.  It was a struggle, but I eventually made it to the laughable end.  After everything that happens throughout the movie, the main characters final resort was absolutely ridiculous.

If you are a hopeful romantic, you'll love it and hate it all at once... Mostly because there is beauty even in the saddest parts. If you'll be unable to get over the challenging moral choices that this film presents - to see the underlying themes of sacrifice, hope, and self-acceptance - then this may be one you'll want to skip.

Then it was about Brits. But the final straw would have been if it was a foreign film with subtitles, I would have never finished it. I was trying to write while watching. I finally stopped writing and gave this movie my full attention. It earned it. The thing to remember, this is a movie. It's point is to tell a story. And make money. To pull at your heart strings. To extract an emotional response. To dramatize, romanticize, and hold your interest. And it did just that. Without blowing anything up or bludgeoning anyone. She stole the show. And my heart. I laughed and enjoyed it, right up until the crying started. And for this white male in his fifties, I couldn't stop burning through the roll of paper towels. Sadly, it was his choice, not mine, not hers and not yours. His. He was single minded and not wishy washy. He didn't want anyone's pity nor did he garner any. We all hoped she'd win him over just as she'd won all of us over. The point is: NONE OF US WANTED HIM TO DIE. We all wanted him to live. We all hoped she'd convince him to see his value.

7747049,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"I have 2 opinions about this so read through to understand.

My Cons about the story:
1. Let me say that any disability, whether it be quadriplegic, blindness, diabetics, divorce, broken heart, pink eye or a pimple, blah blah blah, isn't a excuse to say to the world that it would be better off without you and have no purpose in life. Talk about lifting someone's spirit.

2. The story line had its high/lows and sometimes was a bit all over the place.  Example, Louisa had a boyfriend who appeared who didn't appreciate her and still struggling what purpose he played in this movie especially when than Louisa doesn't address the relationship issues she had with him.

3. Will may have fallen in love (still cant tell) with Louisa but think was a bit selfish to allow her to believe he wanted to start a relationship with her. (Can't say more without given up the plot, sorry)

--

Pros
1. Any life situation like physical disability, terminal illness, or anything you can think of may lead individuals to decide that the best course of action is death.  There are so many to list and the only few I've experience was, cancer 2x, witnessing 4 deaths in my immediate family and job loss, however although the feeling of anxiety and despair sets in I survived it all support I had in my circle.  People whom are alone and have no one may feel different and action their decisions different.  In this story, Will was rich and although had enough money to live (probably) he found that he felt less of himself compared to his previous life and felt that ending his life was the best since he didn't find a purpose comparing his previous life style to current day worth living.  I can't relate to Wills disability, however, I have a physical deformation from my cancer that I am although happy to be alive still find issues coping with these defects.

2. However, the story shares that Will was in serious pain and that I have seen and experience.  No one wants to be a burden to any family, loved one or those alone be bed bound being taken care of by total strangers and think that is living life, so who's to say that a person cant decide for themselves what they think is right.

Thus, this movie can sway your vote depending on what side you sit at.  Giving a 2 star supporting the actors performance but not the story line,",1499731200,,2326,4.481042654028436
7747050,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I knew this movie would be taboo for many, as assisted suicide is a new concept and considered a ""sin"" by many. I don't feel the same way, so I came into the book with an open mind as well as the movie.  I for one loved it. The characters were great. Acting was solid, and the movie made me laugh many times. It took a very sensitive subject and made it very real. Many people don't want to think of others in this situation. They expect them to deal with their reality. Truth is, it's not a reality everyone wants, and I think If given a grim prognosis, I'd choose the same fate. I never believed in assisted suicide until I watched a neighbor die from ALS. It is one of the worst ways to go, and I couldn't help but put myself in his situation and want a different outcome. I personally would not want to go out that way.  If we are willing to give our ailing pets relief from pain and suffering, why can't we do the same for our loved ones if that is their desire?anyways, back to the movie...

I don't believe that because a film has a plot line that involves an assisted suicide that the film is promoting such an action, as many people have voiced; great art arises to give us something to think about, to feel, to appreciate - not to promote or dismantle any particular ideals. I think the movie offered a balanced view, personally. I also believe that it's each person's right to decide if they want to leave a painful situation like this one, and how beautiful that he had everyone he loved around him and was able to end his suffering with dignity.

It should also make one realize that some decisions are intensely personal and that one should not judge those decisions harshly, even if one  believes that one has walked in those very same shoes. No two people are ever quite alike.

Louisa Clark lives in England, living an ordinary life in a small town with her nice, but equally ordinary, financially hard-pressed family. She has really never ventured far from home. The only thing that sets her apart is her charming, but decidedly quirky, taste in clothing, as well as her kind heart and loving disposition.  Will Traynor, on the other hand, is from the same small town, but  his background is decidedly upper-crust, having grown up in Traynor Castle, which is his family home. Will is well traveled,  an extreme sports enthusiast who has his pick of beautiful women, and he buys and sells companies for a living.  Yes, he is a veritable master of the universe.

Perversely, the fates intervene. Rendered a quadriplegic after an accident, Will is now back at Traynor Castle with his parents. He has all the comforts and care for which a severely disabled person could dream of having. A custom designed and crafted, handicap accessible apartment at the castle, the very best of medical care, and a personal nurse to tend to his physical needs. His parent also get him a caregiver/companion. This is where Louisa Clark comes in. She has just been let go from her waitressing job, and needing a job, she applies for the position of caregiver/companion to Will. To her own surprise, she gets the position and slowly, but surely, grows into it. For her, it is the experience of a lifetime, as her horizons are broadened by Will. For Will, it is also an experience, as he seems to come out of his doldrums. He appears to have a new lease on life thanks to the irrepressibly joyous Louisa. A special connection develops between the two, but it appears to be not enough to dissuade Will from a decision with which he has come to term.

Emilia Clarke is fantastic in the role of Louisa Clark. One cannot help but fall in love with her, as she blossoms on the screen. Sam Claflin is outstanding as Will, our impossibly handsome, former master of the Universe. One can feel his pain. One can also feel the pain of his patrician parents, as Will ultimately makes a decision that not everyone may or will understand. Terrific performances are also given by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. The rest of the cast is excellent, as well.

In ""Me Before You"" , a quadriplegic man , Will , who lost his ""rich , accomplished , handsome"" lifestyle faces the choice to die while his quirky female caregiver , Louisa , chooses to love him. The movie is so well written that the subplots ( including class distinction ,  masculine identity , job frailty , social shallowness , life meaning , and defining love ) make its viewing independently worthwhile. The casting is perfect , and I found myself believing idealized conflict of Will while being charmed by the endearing , expressive , and selfless character of Louisa.

While tragic , the film seems to be deliberately portraying an idealized situation. By choosing an ""ideal"" man ( rich , accomplished , handsome ) , we see this tragedy in its best possible light , and how those blessings seem to add to Wills regret. By choosing an ""ideal"" woman ( pretty , cheery , selfless ) we see an optimal mate , but recognize the limitations in the relationship. By handling physical tragedy in an ""ideal"" environment ( a coworker completely handles Wills physical needs and everything is paid for ) , we are free to exclude the immediate , persistent , and overwhelming realities of Wills need. One surmises that for most people would have a much harder time and less access to good care , so the question of selflessness takes on a more sterile analysis.

Despite my admiration for this film , I do not feel it expresses both sides of the subject well. The glaring assumption is that identity is arbitrarily valued. This manifests itself consistently in the implicit assumptions about purity , faithfulness , and ultimately euthanasia. An example of the irony this produces is the intent by Will to challenge Louisa's character to embrace more ambition. If her character had been thus actualized at the beginning of the film , would she have ever been able to truly love Will in the first place? Does selflessness preclude ambition? And if so , what are we saying about true love?

While many characters in the film disagree with the final choice , and even brand it as murder , there is no exploration as to why it is murder , or why identity requires ""rich accomplished handsomeness"" to be valid or valued. If God put me in his situation , I can imagine feelings that would be overwhelming and suicidal. But life is not complete because we get what we want. This is because our wants or choices are not inherently valuable or ideal. I believe this movie compromises morally in its conclusion and refuses to confront the ultimate hubris of arbitrary identity. It fails to consider the simple possibility that Will is wrong.  Even though it is above average in its portrayal of consequences , in reality I feel it serves as an advertisement for euthanasia.",1499299200,9,2770,4.703092783505155
7747143,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"As unrealistic this movie portrays the life of a quadriplegic person, it was an emotional roller-coaster. Cried 99% of the movie, mind you at the time of viewing  I am pregnant and emotions are easily triggered. Ending was predictable. depressing and not believable, but hey it's a movie meant to pull at your heart-strings.  As much as it annoys the crap out of me how hollywood depicts disabled people in general, this was a great movie. Beautiful love story that has a different kind of happy ending you can say.",1499212800,,515,4.711111111111111
7747144,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"This was a lovely if heartbreaking film. On a superficial level, it was fun seeing stars from some of my other favorite movies/shows in this. I've only seen Emilia in Game of Thrones, and I was pleasantly surprised by her acting here. Charles Dance, naturally, is perfect in everything he does. It was nice seeing ""Bates"" from Downton as well, and when I realized Patrick was Neville Longbottom, I geeked out a bit.

All of that said, unlike many of the movie's harsh critics, I found the ending more realistic and Will's decision, as well as the support of the people who loved him, to be touching. Wanting him to live on when he was in constant pain (both physically and emotionally) would have been selfish on their part. Of course they want him to live, but they allowed him to be the one to make that decision. It was mentioned that he had already attempted suicide on his own previously, and that he'd also nearly died from an infection earlier. For a man who is unable to make a single decision about his life...cannot feed himself, cannot bathe himself, cannot use the bathroom without help, cannot get out of bed, cannot do anything without someone else's assistance, he was allowed to make the biggest decision of all and choose how and when he would die. He could not control anything else, but he could control that and make that one final decision to end his pain and be eased out of this world with gentle dignity.

I know many will disagree, but I think it was beautiful. I pray that I'll never be in Will's place, or have a loved one in his place. I know without a doubt it would be easier for me to make the same decision for myself than to watch a loved one decide to leave me. But I hope, if they could realistically make this choice for themselves, I would have the courage to be supportive.

It's a film that does make you think. Some people don't like to think about it, and I surely understand that. For some, Will's choice simply is not the choice they would make. I respect that as well. Everyone is different.",1499212800,6,2035,4.435828877005347
7747145,1,B01F5ZY3JI,Hated this movie. Will is a self centered prick. Don't waste your time watching a romanticized suicide. If I could give zero stars I would.,1499212800,2,139,4.6
7747146,5,B01F5ZY3JI,I don't believe this movie was created in order to make a statement (as some are insisting) as much as it was just telling a story. I was disappointed in the ending like many others. But movies so often seek to give you a happy ending and that is not the way life really is. LIfe is not always just a series of up and downs with a happy ending. Sometimes there are unhappy endings. It was brave of the writer to try to compose a story of this nature. Sure there are some parts that could have been done differently but overall I think this was a very interesting movie.,1499212800,,569,4.135135135135135

NO. Instead, bask in the movie's message that if something goes bad in your life, quickly fly to Switzerland and end it! GO! NOW! END YOUR LOSER LIFE,<YOU LOSER> Depressed yet? Ya, well, I was as I sat there in shock as the main character proved he was an utter COWARD and euthanized himself because he was now in a wheelchair. And the main lady lead REJOICED she'd come into a fortune cause that's really gonna keep you warm at night! What kind of message does this send to every person suffering with a disability????? That their life is worthless!?! I'm not a fan of Stephen Hawking but do you think he's fans think he's worthless? Or the mother at the mall whose son has Down Syndrome. Is that child worthless? What have we come to that Hollywood packages a pretty picture of death and calls it romance. Life is precious no matter who you are or what your life is like. Man is made in God's image and that alone make a person worth a fortune. So, every life counts no matter who you are.",1499126400,2,1169,4.342465753424658

I had to remind myself of his male caregiver making the point that Will would often cry out in pain and was clearly suffering.  I don't support any message implying that people with disabilities can't enrich the world or live a great quality of life.  I do support the ""death with dignity"" movement though and believe if a person is in so much pain or losing their cognitive ability they should have the right to end their lives with medical assistance if they so choose.",1499040000,,630,4.413793103448276

7747188,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I will never understand how it feels to be in Will's position and have read some of the other reviews from the pov of people who do understand how it feels and all I have to say is this: Just because you, as a fellow quadriplegic, are upset that he chose to die because he didn't want to live like that you really need to take a double look at this movie because it wasn't about him not wanting to live. He WAS living before the accident, he loved life, but now that he can't do anything himself he is miserable. Sure he found someone who loved him but that wasn't enough because he is still a quadriplegic no matter how much love she could have given him. If anything he died knowing he gave her enough money so she could live happy like he wanted to. He was happy knowing that she would be happy even if it meant living without him.
Honestly would you guys have rather they made him start to regain his movement in the end and live happily ever after? NO. That's a cop out ending. This was an emotional and well written and produced ending. Probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Plus I love Emilia Clarke with a burning passion which is the only reason I chose this movie to watch in the beginning and I'm thankful.",1499040000,2,1233,4.184873949579832
7747189,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"What I saw was a beautiful love story that ended so sadly.  Unfortunately, Will's character could not get past his new life in spite of all the blessings he could have been grateful for in his new life.  There are those who may choose not to fight and I personally think this is sad.  Whatever our journey is, we don't always walk in another' shoes so who am I to judge another person's choice.
Lou's character showed a loving, caring down-to-earth personality who tried so hard to change Will's mind.  In the end she loved him enough to respect his wishes and to be there for him.  I liked the loving and caring part of the story that they each had for one another.  Tear jerker but also showed much love.  So much better than a violent, over-the-top murderous type movie.",1499040000,4,773,4.439716312056738

7747192,3,B01F5ZY3JI,"I loved the movie until the end.  They romanticize suicide and there is nothing romantic about suicide.  All it does is take the pain from the original person and give it to their surviving family and friends.  It destroys families, and lays guilt, and blame on the survivors who are left in the aftermath of the individuals selfish decision.

I hope in reality if someone has a mental health disease a state does not assist in his suicide and instead focuses on his treatment.",1498953600,5,465,4.578313253012048

7747306,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"I have something to say about the book ""Me Before You"" by Jojo Moyes and the movie Me Before You along with those involved in making it. If I could give it zero stars, trust me I would. I have spent my entire life watching the media portray people with a disability, people like me, as -

- angelic or innocent
- the villain
- someone who has to be transformed to have superhuman characteristics in order for the disabilty to be cool enough
- sentimentalized and overcoming their poor misfortune with a happily ever after
- perfectly noble or selfless though most often as a two-dimensional character
- an outcast
- a charity to help build the character of another able-bodied character

And then there is this?? You've got to be kidding me!

Here let me help ruin your book and your film by giving away basically everything.

A millionaire who was in an accident and is now quadriplegic slowly falls ""in love"" with his care assistant who finds out that he made a deal with his parents - he'll stay alive for another 6 months and if he hasn't changed his mind by then then they will not thwart his plan to legally ""die with dignity"" through assisted suicide at a quaint little cottage in Switzerland (which by the way is an actual, real place) because he just can't handle it anymore *insert expletives here - a whole lot of them - trust me - I have a lot of them* This poor, confused girl spends all this time doing everything to make him happy enough that he'll decide to live, literally spending her life trying to complete him. (Can we say horrible disaster? Yes, making someone's whole existence dependent on you making them happy -- That's true love. Come on!!!) Mind you for half of the time while she's falling for him she's stringing along her current boyfriend - who is a jerk - but she's being loving and selfless and this is a romance story so obviously it's okay.) And they go on this beautiful vacation after he recovers from a spell in the hospital and at the end of it he tells her that he's still going to go through with it because he can't be him anymore, that he's lost himself, that he can't be intimate in the same way he used to and not being able to hold her or touch her is killing him so he just has to end it all! But he wants her to please understand and come with him to be there when it happens. *I cannot* Then a huge fight ensues. He leaves for the place to be with his parents. She flies there at the last minute which ends in a disgustingly peaceful, romanticized goodbye. Then he dies. THEN he leaves her with money to pursue her dreams and a vacation to Paris (where he had wanted to go back to but wouldn't when she asked because he was no longer him anymore and he didn't want to be stared at...) complete with a letter saying he loves her and will always be with her.

What? What?? Great. So let me get this new able-bodied controlled literature/media perspective straight? Now the plan is to add the portrayal of a disabled character that thinks they are completely worthless and then we'll romanticize their decision to end it all because geez it really must be an empty and pitiful way to live and dying instead is so much more dignifying. That's going to sell now, huh? That's the new heart-wrenching romance.

Me ending my life or anyone who is significantly disabled ending their life can somehow be more ""dignifying"" and ""beautiful"" than continuing to live it.

How dare you!!!

7747314,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"[spoilers] This was a moving love story with good acting. It does draw you in and by the end you are really hoping beyond hope that Will changes his mind about the decision he made before meeting Lou. But he doesn't. What many negative reviewers are not taking into account is that EVERYONE in the story besides Will himself wanted him to live. Even his father, who ultimately supported Will's decision, was not rooting for it. And that is why I do not agree that this movie negatively portrays disabled people as a burden and better off dead.

The movie makes reference multiple times to the chronic pain Will is in, the constant struggle against infection, repeated near-fatal hospitalizations, PTSD nightmares, continuous changes of tubing, painful therapy, and so on. If viewers were hoping for him to keep up the fight because he found love and was experiencing happiness again, that just goes to show you that the acting and plot line pulled the audience in effectively. In the end he chooses to go through with his plans for assisted suicide. I was super sad that this happened, and agree with other reviewers that Lou would have much preferred being in Paris with Will versus without. But the movie does NOT suggest for one second that Lou is happy she is free of Will and got away with his money. That is a total misreading of the ending!

The character Will makes a choice that leaves us sad and feeling empty - do we make the same criticisms when a movie character chooses to leave his loved ones and go to war and then dies? Do we call them selfish and pan the film? Will is a character in a story that makes one decision out of many available to him. So we feel sad after watching it instead of warm and fuzzy..boo hoo. It's a human story, it portrays difficulty and the messiness that comes from a special mix of pain/love/despair/hope/anger/caring that these characters were experiencing.",1498435200,7,1903,4.643916913946588

Basically, if your arms and legs don't move, you have no value and so it makes perfect sense for you to kill yourself, and NOBODY has the right to question you because they have arms and legs that work.  What a bunch of malarkey.  This was insanely disappointing and turned upside down.  This story had an incredible opportunity to demonstrate that the value of human life is inherent, not utilitarian, that love is selfless, not self-serving, that relationships can be sacrificial, not one-sided... but no, it all boiled down to the poor pathetic cripple who felt so sorry for himself that he didn't care about anybody else, and so no matter how much he was loved, and no matter how much he was treasured, death was the only answer and to hell with anyone else.

So many people with physical and mental illnesses are struggling through depression fighting hard to believe ""life is worth living."" Then this movie says ""No its not."" I also kept thinking what the title of the movie meant. At one point, the lead character says to the heroine, something like ""You didn't know me before you."" And it ended up that he was saying ""me before you . . . was better than the me with you."" That's why he decides to kill himself, because the ""me before you"" was better than the ""me you know."" What in the world kind of a message is that!? Not only is it so unkind to the heroine, it is extremely discouraging to people in similar situations to the male lead. Really horrible movie. Definitely not written by someone who has struggled with suicide or by someone who deeply loves someone who struggles with suicide.

""Me Before You"" is accurate. ""I'll just give her some money so that she will have an amazing life without me as a burden."" (Like money solves everything right?)

7747459,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"Emilia Clarke is giving it her all in this film, but the source material is too sappy, romanticized and morally problematic to rise above. Clarke's character gets a job looking after a quadriplegic man, but instead of having to actually be a real caretaker and deal with all the gritty realities that come with severe injuries, she's basically told to pal around with him. So...she's a hired friend?

Besides that weird bit, this turns into an unlikely romance, which does have some nice moments. However, the story starts commenting on what makes life worth living, what makes someone a worthy romantic partner and when assisted suicide is an answer. The film, I felt, essentially concluded that not being able to live life in the way you expected is worse than death. It's just a really distasteful message, especially when many people who are severely disabled still strive to live life to the fullest.

The second star is for the actors, who really did do their best with the material, and the costumes and production design, which were also good. In the end, I just can't recommend this unless you're morbidly curious about how badly a romantic film can screw up a message.",1497484800,,1178,4.826732673267327

7747463,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"Beautifully acted & brilliantly written tragedy that ignores all medical reality in order to allow for grief.  Its a good and sweet movie, but also a story of giving up.  I wanted to like it but couldn't.  I'm not going to spoil the conclusion, but I'm just going to say that there are real people living with very similar challenges who work incredibly hard to persevere.  I admire and such efforts, and could not indulge the antithesis, no matter how romantically framed.  It's genuinely a SLAP IN THE FACE of individuals who are actually coping with - and persevering over - spinal injuries.

The subject matter was difficult for some I am sure, but I could appreciate the love story and the right of the character choosing to make the decision that he did despite the new beauty that had been brought into it. I don't think the movie meant to speak for everyone in a similar situation, it just focused on this one particular man's story and his choice. Art imitates life and this was a beautiful example of that,",1497398400,,502,4.408602150537634
7747466,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"Beautiful film that is so well done, and it does not reflect poorly on the source material. The characters and story are well-drawn, and the cinematography is beautiful. It is hard to condense a rich, detailed novel into a short two-hour film, yet the screenwriters did a better job than many a writer of adaptations (that Ive viewed in the past). Although I do not agree philosophically with assisted suicide, I support the right of other humans to choose when and how they might end their own lives (particularly if they feel that their quality of life is unacceptable). But, being of the opinion that ones pain (emotional or otherwise) is ones path, I didn't love the ending of the film or book. Others may love the story entirely.

7747467,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"I agree with Barry Bannister's comments.  I just watched this movie with my adult daughter.  I also would not have watched it and neither would she, if we would have realized it was going to glorify assisted suicide.  Every person's life has equal importance in God's eyes.  Any person thinking they are better off dead than alive is wrong.  I think of what Joni Erickson has accomplished, since her accident.  When the sanctity of human life is trivialized society unravels.  Think of the millions killed by Pol Pot.  Hitler started by killing those he thought were weak, such as disabled and worked his way up to exterminating millions.  Someone in pain or paralyzed can be an amazing example of living life to its fullest, love and be loved by others just the same as anyone else.  Sure life may be harder, but we are all given struggles, some are just not physical.  Family and friends of those that are disabled or are dying of disease can grow stronger and to be better people through helping and having relationships with struggles like this, also.

We know of women that were sold the lie that abortion was maintaining their own bodies health and now live with the guilt of ending their unborn child's life thirty plus years later.  Life is meant to be valued.  Ending a life prematurely is never a good option.  It creates a hole in everyone's life that never should be there.  I hope others choose not to watch this movie, because this is a lie being sold in a pretty package romanticizing suicide.  Suicide is horrible no matter how it is packaged.",1497398400,16,1559,4.631386861313868

Great lesson on the power of the mind; both Will and Lou were totally transformed in only six months, because they ""changed their minds"" about some things.

I feel like hollywood is always trying to move everything to the left policy-wise by packaging it in a pretty box with a cute leading lady and a love story, so that makes it okay.  This story was terrible because of the ending. It made Will out to be the most selfish person and so it ruined any chemistry they had and made the whole story unbelievable. Basically, Will was upset because he couldn't have the life he wanted, so he chose to have no life. This is the mantra of the snowflakes. I want what I want...or else.

Sure, it is totally sad but instead of some fake ending of love and wellness it shows the truth of pain and suffering for all involved.
There is also some humor and definitely drama in this show.
Each of the actors and actresses play their roles amazingly well.
You can feel real true chemistry in the love between the quirky cheerful attitude of the small town gal caretaker and Will (the man who is the main character) who was a very successful financially rich banker who lives in a castle and becomes.a quadriplegic.
The scenery is beautiful as well.
Very touching movie.
When he tells her that he wishes she knew him before the accident (the me before you) and she replies she would have been invisible to him (this is an amazing moment in the story and so very true in most of real life) -- she would have been serving the rich young man with a blond on his arm, etc is how she puts it..

While I can fully empathize with someone dealing with chronic pain and disability and the hopelessness they feel at the prospect that this is their destiny for the remainder of their days, suicide (assisted or otherwise) is most often a selfish act.  I found it disturbing that Will believed he could not make Lou happy, in his present state; Lou was obviously in love with him.  He can't let go of who he was before the accident and explore the possibilities of his new reality; he would rather cause intense grief to his parents and to Lou than to come to terms with his situation and do his best to make the world a better place.  For those of us who know para- and quadriplegics who are incredible people and whose lives have profoundly touched our own, this movie is disturbing in even suggesting that the world might be better off without these courageous and wonderful people.

In the film, his therapist shared how much pain he is in daily, how he hides that pain from others, how in his mind and emotions he can't leave his former life behind. I was my father's caregiver during the last years of his life as cancer destroyed his body and mind. In the months before his death his left leg was amputated, a full hip disarticulation. From that day forward, not only did he suffer from cancer that was eating away at his body but he felt additional horrible pain in the leg that was no longer there. It was described as phantom pain. Before the amputation, the doctors, who were all wonderful and our only support, did not recommend the amputation. My father has developed a severe infection in his leg and his heart rate was dropping and if the leg was not removed he would die from the infection. During the time of this infection, he was the most comfortable he had been in years and would drift off peacefully if left in this state. I couldn't make the decision, what felt like to me, to not save him. The next few months were worse than the years before and he reached a level of emotional misery that I didn't know existed. He would have moments of brief happiness but he could not accept what had happened to his body and he was mourning the death of his life before he died. That is how I feel about the message in this movie, Will is mourning his life and suffering every day. We all should have the right to choose when to stop suffering. It's cruel to ask or expect someone to ""make others feel better"" by dying a slow agonizing death. My father's natural death was horrific. For me, this was a message to those that can't move on and are in misery, telling them that they are important, they are not selfish to do what is best for them. And those that love you will put aside their pain and be strong for them.",1496966400,39,2016,4.293963254593176

They are not quitters.  They persevere against incredible odds.  One of my favorite quotes says, ""Sometimes, real superheroes live in the hearts of small children fighting big battles.""  I see that play out in my classroom day after day, year after year.  In this movie, the male lead, Will, does not want to continue living because he can never be the man he used to be.  He could have chosen to be a different man, a new man.  Instead, he chose not to be.  The dialogue alludes to the fact that he is in constant, unbearable pain, yet we never really see that.  It's hard to develop empathy for his physical struggles when his attitude is so grating.  I'm older, and over the years, I have seen several family members and friends in unrelenting pain due to cancer.  I've seen them use pills, morphine drips, and, sometimes, alcohol to cope with the pain.  I have sometimes been at their bedsides when they drew their last breath.  And everyone of them fought as hard as they could to live another day, another hour, another minute--not for themselves, but for the people who loved them.

This movie was amazingly beautiful. It brought me to tears so many times and I just about balled at the end. I don't agree with the ending at all though. I think that Will was beyond selfish in even considering leaving Lou. As someone who has found her soulmate, if my husband ever considered killing himself and therefore condemning me to a life without my one reason for living, I could never forgive him. Once you have found that one person who makes you whole, there is no reason to live without them. There is no amount of money or traveling that can even come close to even the simplest life with your soulmate by your side. The ending really pissed me off!! He was supposed to chose her!

In the beginning, it felt like it had so much powerful potential, but they threw that all out for a selfish, Liberal, hedonistic message about how your life isn't worth living if you can't live it the way you think you should. Did it mean nothing to Will that his existence meant everything to Louisa? What about his mother? The creators of the film somehow managed to spare the audience the discomfort of viewing the realistic details of the daily life of a quadriplegic, while also justifying and glamorizing his assisted suicide. I feel all the more distressed by this film because the acting and editing were of a surprising quality and it drew me in very quickly. I felt emotionally affected by the characters' motivations. I so badly wanted this to be a story about the sanctity of life, even when it's not what you expect it to be. It had all the promise of being exactly that until about the last quarter of the movie. I'm disgusted by the writer's flippant perspective on such an emotionally sensitive subject.

This was an amazing story that dropped me and my husband at the end, hence my subject title above. It was simply horrible that Will would go through with the suicide still AFTER he finds love again and life seems to become livable again. I mean, it was such a let down to watch this character develop not into someone better after getting back so many of life's truly worthwhile things, but into a completely hopeless and selfish fool who left a grieving girl that totally loved him as he was, but his parents as well. Oh but wait, then we see this girl who was left devastated by this fool...smiling and looking soo happy to go spending this good sum of money she's been left after the suicide, as if nothing ever happened! And to boot, she's also reading this guy's letter telling her how she needs to take this money and ""live her life to the fullest""...  Really? This coming from a guy who would rather kill himself, give up true love than live because he is now in a wheelchair and can't "" respond "" to her had she been naked (wedding conversation with Clark) etc etc.
The ending left me feeling like both lead characters were foolish and their so called love maybe wasn't so deep after all. Louise shocked me at the end because she was so happy spending his money lol.

7747559,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"The acting was phenomenal, especially by Emilia. Her character is so natural and compelling, and the array of emotions she portrayed was some of the best I've ever seen. This story really captured the beauty of people in a real, potent way, in the small, personal areas of life. It had lots of heartwarming moments and witty dialogue (though some of the language and topics are too crass for a younger audience and seemed unnecessary for the story).
I really wanted to love this story, and I did up until the moment I realized how it was going to end. **Spoilers** I find it disturbing--and dangerous--to show euthanasia as a viable--and even preferred--option. It seems that his parents barely protest or look for other options, and never is it suggested that he speak with a councilor or pastor or someone in the same position as him who can give him hope and a purpose. He gives up, and they all let him--when he could do so much with his life! Many others in his situation have found ways to use their brilliant minds to change the world for the better, and he's rich enough to be able to do anything he might choose to pursue and have access to the latest and greatest care and mobility available. Money doesn't satisfy, of course, but the thing he was missing was love, and when he finds it, he throws it away. I don't in any way mean to trivialize his pain, but there are many people who are perfectly healthy and mobile who will never experience a love like that, and one could argue that that love is far more important than all the rest.
The story also gives no attention to what he thinks might come after death, which is something he would *have* to think about to make that kind of decision. Is he really ready to die, or simply ready to stop living? I don't see how those two questions can be separated, and without thinking about both sides of it, his death is shown as glorified and honorable somehow, that he ""will always be with her""--except that he chose not to be with her, because he couldn't stand the thought of her having to care for him. In the end, he dies and leaves her money so she can live her life to the fullest--but as we already saw, being with him was what made her start living fully in the first place! She was able to travel and go scuba diving *because* she was with him--he wasn't a limitation to her. There were so many other solutions to make them both happy and allow them to stay together, and it seemed as though the story refused to acknowledge those other options just to make a point about assisted suicide--to make it seem like a beautiful option. In the end, this movie really left a sour taste in my mouth, made even worse by how well done it was up until that point.",1496534400,5,2718,4.3841584158415845

I have seen Emilia Clarke in Games of Thrones and this just shows she is versatile in love comedies as well. The story is somewhat typical of genre of love stories where a rich man falls in love with a not as well to do woman. But her wits and refreshing personality compensates for all that. The other thing that defines it from the other stories so much is the quadraplegia aspect and the controversial topic of freedom to death/ assisted death.

I will delve more into it for not wanting to spoil it for potential viewers. Another thing is I really liked the clothing design for Emilia Clarke's character.

7747572,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"So nice to romanticize something you know nothing about, trivializing it by making a love story out of a subject they are completely ignorant.  I am a quadriplegic, in a similar condition as the character, Will, in this story; I have been for about 38 years.  I wonder why these stories about the severely disabled, and there have been many, always end in the poor disabled person riding off into the sunset of life, dying, usually by their own ""hands"", leaving the world a better place without them.  The message is, sacrifice yourself because you're better of that way, and so is everyone around you.  That's a twisted message.  It's the common bleak message of despair and ignorance perceived by in this case, those who need a foil for writing a love story with what they think is a unique and different romance.  You might respond, ""Oh, it's just a romantic love story.  Don't take it so seriously."", or, ""You're taking it all the wrong way and missing the point.""  Perhaps, but if every time there was a story penned about a subject person you identify with (pick your favorite male/female/cultural or ethnic character), that story ended with the protagonist concluding the world was better off without them, and in so doing, kill themselves and prove the proposition, you would begin to wonder about the way society views you; and in this story that conclusion is manifest to reality by Will killing himself (and we don't see any of that ugliness) and  ""Clark"" being given or rewarded a large bank account to... a better life now that Will is gone.  Gee, what a happy ending.  Moral of the story: the world is better without the to-be-pitied disabled person, and life goes on and improves for the non-disabled.  Does that principle apply to all the marginalized?

This is not just a story for me, it is real life; it can be tough, but it can also be good and happy, and can be satisfying with work and struggle, same as for anyone else.  Trivializing and stereotyping it with ""you're better off dead"" messages is ignorant, grossly inappropriate and wrong.  Sorry, but we can do better that this.  There are always options, and with faith and a belief in yourself by you and those around you, and with perseverance and dedication to a goal, those desires are reachable.  The pathways are just different and require a shift in perceptions.  And remember, no one wins by themselves.  There's always help from someone.  Moral: it is not romantic to quit because it's hard, but it is romantic to succeed, and in succeeding, the world is a better place.",1496448000,"2,863",2553,4.707207207207207

7747583,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"The background music was corny.  Whenever they did a regular song it was great, but the score didn't match the rest of the music in the film so that it didn't make sense and was infuriating.  The whole movement of the story seemed choppy disconnected and rushed. I can't tell if that was because half the time I liked the music and half the time it seemed out of place.  I wish I would have watched it without reading the book - I wonder if that would have affected how I perceived it...because I would have been wrapped up in the plot? Her clothes were spot on!  They were colorful and cheerful just like I imagined. There were some great scenes visually as well. And as far as the way Emilia Clarke looked and the way Sam Claflin looked, I thought they fit the characters visually but their acting and chemistry wasn't quite there for me. It seems like Sam Claflin was not allowed to be as rude as Will Traynor was in the book.  I was also disappointed they didn't include the scene in the maze where Louisa bares her soul and so does Will Traynor so that they both truly became vulnerable with each other.  I understand they can't include everything, but there were some other things that could have been cut in favor of this scene because I felt like it was a huge transition in their relationship.  I also felt like that transition from mean Will to kind forbearing Will was blurred and rushed, so the sweet juxtaposition from who he was to who he became with her was lacking.  Emilia wasn't as emotional as I felt Louisa Clark was.  Whenever she cried, it seemed incredibly fake.  I realize Emilia can't help but have the eyebrows she has, but she furrowed them at odd times... that didn't make sense with what was going on in the scene - this is weird to say but her crazy eyebrows were a huge distraction for me, lol - there were many times I didn't feel like her face matched the emotion of the scene and the director should have caught that and re-did the shot.

The book itself is very addicting and great writing - I don't care for the end.  I was secretly hoping the director would take creative license and change the ending...but alas.  I don't understand all the work Louisa's character put into it and it wasn't rewarded... I felt like Will Traynor in both the book and the movie didn't love her completely, was not courageous or brave, was not a real man about it...but was selfish.  When you love someone - you live for them despite your own discomfort because you don't want to be disconnected from their souls or make them live without you... it didn't make sense at all.  About the only one of his reasons for still killing himself that I kind of felt sympathy for was his frustration at not being able to have sex, and do with her what he wanted as this made sense with the kind of man he was before his accident, but from what I read of quads - they can have sex and it is almost more sensual than it is for the rest of us with normal faculties because they climax based on their other heightened senses.  It would have been beautiful for him to discover this.  And I would think the challenge of that would still hold some kind of excitement and experimental pleasure for Will.  There are so many courageous Quads out there living their lives and pushing through their disability and this is just, not inspiring at all.  I would be tempted to say there was an agenda here like some have suggested, but actually I don't think there was.  I think the writer truly sought out to understand people who choose suicide for themselves in these instances and give them back their dignity that so many people try to take from them.  But she didn't succeed at it for me.  I am so much more attracted to sacrificial love based in humility... Will still came off as too proud, too selfish.  I'm a fan of endings that aren't conventional...but this one was not satisfying in the least - I would have rather he died by pneumonia than lethal injection - I'm amazed there are so many who like this film and the story.  This doesn't mean I can't re-write my own ending... :)  hehe!

With that being said - I disagree with those who think his suicide is such an atrocious thing.  Don't get me wrong - I think suicide is wrong and perhaps lethal injection is wrong in and of itself, but I think modern technology creates a sticky wicket about it all - if he hadn't had all those machines and doctors keeping him alive, he would have died a natural death - sometimes I believe we should allow ourselves to die and not fight it like it is something to be afraid of.  I don't think it's right that he goes somewhere to end his life - especially when there is a woman in his life now who loves him, and wants to live with him, but I think his parents should have let him go at the first instead of insisting he live as a quadriplegic on life support.  Their's is the greater selfishness.  If I found myself in the same situation: and I couldn't stand the reality of living dependent on modern technology, for myself to feel at peace with the way I go, I would hope I had the courage to disconnect everything and allow myself to die naturally rather than take something that would kill me.  The one thing the story has going for it, is this discussion and exchange of thought and opinions that the story provokes - the book gets much higher ratings for me, but the movie did not do the book justice.

Edited to add:  Okay, I take back all the negative things I said (the first time I reviewed this movie I gave it 2 stars)... haha!  I went back and watched it again - I really truly wanted to like this movie, because I adore Sam Claflin - he seems like a first rate soul.  I didn't know that much about Emilia Clarke.  So I took away all of my preconceived notions from reading the book and watched it for what it was -  Louisa was supposed to be awkward and corny and Emilia did that beautifully, eyebrows and all, and the scene on the beach where I especially thought Emilia was not near emotional enough - I think she was interpreting how she felt Louisa would react to something so upsetting.  She wasn't the sort that would yell and scream and make a scene.  She would be devastated and quietly make her exit... I TRULY think it is better to watch the movie first and then read the book.  It needs to be in that order so that when you read the book it is like watching deleted scenes.  The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because I disagree with assisted suicide... that is it - but I understand completely why people would still like that choice...and in an odd way - I feel like Louisa - she didn't want him to die... but she was willing to stand by him despite him doing something she disagreed with.  I could never run a business off of or make money in assisting suicides, but I could go with a beloved friend who insisted on doing such a thing - that is between them and God.  I would be absolutely heartbroken, but people have choices and in this lifetime we are all given the option to sin.  Even God does not take that away from us and He certainly has the power to do so.  And God is not unrighteous.  So it is not sinful for me to be present or anyone to be present when people we love make decisions we disagree with.",1496361600,,7252,4.295371050698016

When he chooses to have himself commit suicide it truly represents him choosing 'me before you'. I have loved ones that have never been able to walk or have been paralyzed but yet were so grateful they have fought it and has inspired and even humbled me to see their great strength in a weak frame. However, this movie is built around selfish motives and it ends up with the woman getting money and a bag of perfume after his suicide.

One thing at least they said right was the mother in the movie said it, ""this is murder."" That is exactly what it is, and no one should face God in those terms, leaving people devastated and broken because of selfish wants.

They'll live happily ever after! The end. Smiles all around. Do we have any more popcorn?

SPOILER ALERT: At the end I was crying and furious, and grand was left with the notion that suicide is a viable option for one's problems. Thanks, filmmaker.

His situation was dramatic. His life had taken a terrible turn, to be sure, as happens to people every day. But he had so MANY blessings and opportunities to have a meaningful and, yes, JOYFUL life that the filmmakers decision to simply end him was an egregious insult to people who struggle to even breath, and succeed at that with dignity.

I believe that people should have the power over their end-of-life decisions. If I'm faced with end days in terrible pain and suffering, I might choose assisted suicide. And if someone I loved needed that kind of help, I would give it

But this? This was sickening propaganda to encourage the disabled to get out of the way so the able-bodied can enjoy ""full lives"" unencumbered by the ""nuisance"" needs of the disabled.

To the very last moment grand and I thought life and love would win out. But instead we were sickened. And I can't speak for her on this count, but when it comes to movies, it takes a lot to sicken me. This one sure did. I couldn't apologize to her enough.

7747609,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I really had no idea what this movie was about. I was bored one evening and in the mood to watch a romantic type movie. The acting on the part of the female lead can be a little overdone at times but her character is supposed to be quirky. The cinematography was gorgeous and the whole thing was paced well. I had figured what the ending would be and I think it was the only way it could have logically ended, otherwise it would be cheesy.

As for the content of the movie, I think it was a bold move to make this. Then again, I'm not sure this was intended for American audiences. The whole ""let the fairytale being in the sky decide everything for us"" is so engrained in most ignorant brains that of course there would be intense backlash against having some autonomy in not just life, but death. As someone who has attended to the medical needs of paraplegic's and many disabled persons, this movie does not show more than a sliver of the hardships they endure on a daily basis. Not only that, but many families use their disabled family member (especially if the disability came as part of an accident) as a cash cow. It's truly sickening. It's easy to say 'wow, suicide is so selfish' but until you have lived that day in, day out with no hope of recovery, where your life is sitting in a chair 24/7 unable to attend to your smallest need, then don't pass judgement.",1496188800,,1371,4.334630350194552
7747610,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"The movie was extremely well executed from beginning till the end. Love the acting and chemistry between the two lead actor and actress.
There will be two type of people, one who are more open minded with assisted suicide, and the other is that oppose of assisted suicide. Every one has their opinion and I really do believe that they are both valid and understandable. Some may say that it's selfish to take one's life because it's not their choice to do so. In the movie, even though they never showed but only briefly spoke about how the patient going to extreme chronic pain, that didn't give us the true reason why Will choose that decision with assisted suicided.
Imagine waking up every morning not being able to do the simple things in life feeling helpless with extreme chronic pain, can you live through the rest of your life like that? Is that even consider living? Being paralyzed with extremely pain? You can't truly answer this if you have never ever being in that person or positions shoes.
On the other hand, can you watch the person you love or someone you really care about go through suffering for the rest of their life? Therapy and pain killers can only do so much for a person with such suffering. Or you can be there, supporting their decision and ""love them"" as Clark's father says.

Many people will compare another person with disability with Will but not everyone is the same, everyone has their views, opinions, and every one experience pain differently.
Be more considerate of others, respect their decisions. Ps. ""We can't change people. We can only love them.""",1496188800,,1591,4.702508960573477

I work with kids with a variety of disorders and disabilities, including this who are wheelchair bound, non-verbal, and without control of not just arms and legs but tongue and neck and head as well.  This movie implies that those sweet children are somehow ""less than"" because they can't do things that ""real"" people can do.  I knew there was controversy about this film and I correctly guessed that there was a suicide.  I did not guess that all the reasons he gave would make me sick.  I expected to cry and instead felt disgusted.  Even his love letter at the end was just so empty and false, telling Lou to keep pushing herself and never give up and see the world and blah blah blah when he refuse to do so for himself.  I have contemplated and attempted suicide myself so I know the depths of pain and sorrow involved in that decision, and I'm certainly not saying Will made his decision lightly it even for purely selfish reasons.  I do think that he was basing his worth solely on his ""old"" life and ""previous"" self and as such, I feel like this film is basically a slap in the face to people with disabilities.",1496016000,25,1260,4.471615720524017

This is one case where the movie was stellar.  I'm certain the book must be exquisite... I'll review that too.

Unfortunately, the story behind it all is nothing less than downright terrible.  I didn't know the story before seeing the film and, in my ignorance, I was curious about the title,  Was it really about putting oneself before someone else?  The simple answer is no, not quite.  It's about putting oneself before everyone else and everything else.  The moral is that being self-centered, self-absorbed, and selfish are more fulfilling than loving the ones around us . . . or even trying to return their love.  To see how happy the female lead was portrayed at the very end was sickening - happiness because she got a lot of money after the man she loved committed suicide???  Its been quite a while since I've seen anything quite so shallow and meaningless. I'm a little surprised that the Academy failed to make it the Best Picture of the Year - it would have been so in keeping with popular direction nowadays.

7747640,3,B01F5ZY3JI,"Lovely acting but script doesn't quite scan.  The idea that a paralyzed man would want to go to the wedding of his ex to best friend doesn't fit emotionally.  This choice does, however, foreshadow his final solution to his problem.  What William cares about most is his right to choose his destiny and, in his case, to martyr himself.  Much of his reasoning is capsulated in a scene in which he reveals how much he loved his former life.  This life, seen in bits of flashback, consisted largely of high risk sports activity and daring-do, at which he excelled when not busy with  his career, not to mention a cushy role as son and heir of a castle owning dripping with money doting family.  That such a lifestyle might make a man feel life in a wheelchair didn't quite 'cut it' is not surprising, nor an attitude confusing high achievement with self-knowledge.  Despite being given every advantage money can offer in trying circumstances, not to mention the devotion of a bouncy Pollyanna from the other side of the tracks,  he chooses to end his existence.  One get the sense that he believes he has a right to make this decision the way he has a right to stay in five star hotels and select the best wine for dinner.  For all his attractions -- and he is an attractive character despite his condition -- he fails to see that life is not something to toss aside, simply because there are others involved.  What makes the film moving -- ironically --  is not the fate of the invalid but the deep love his parents have for him and the wonderful performance of the young woman who falls in love with him.  The emotional struggles of these three characters ring true and clear, and restore a bit of the faith that the central character seems so unable to muster.  What the film lacks is a moral message that is, in any way, inspired [though clearly the writer assumed we would respond differently]. William's gift to Ms. Clark -- in the form of some sort of trust fund -- falls terribly short of what she gives to him.",1496016000,,2015,4.482191780821918

Emilia Clarke is so overwhelmingly adorable and lovable, that it is almost like watching a Disney movie where you instantly fall in love with Ariel or Belle, the first time you see them....so much so, that we feel the pain that she felt and then have the desire to lash out, but since it is only a movie, the only way we could do that is to write a horrible review.

But the truth of the matter is that we could NEVER know what a person like that could feel, as a paraplegic, and in addition to that, his ""life"", if you call it that, WAS filled with much pain and suffering, in spite of the magical times that he shared with Emilia....

I fully understood the abject frustration that he felt, when, after falling in love with this person, he was not able to express himself physically to her, as so many of us who have had this kind of love, are privileged to do.....it is easy for us to judge him, and think that he is in-appreciative for  what she offers him and feels for him, but again, as they say:  "" walk a mile in my shoes""......

Naturally, I don't agree with his decision, but naturally, I don't have the life that he has, and  I am not qualified to begin to compare what I would do in a situation that I would never want to be in !!

It draws you in pretending to be art, but then at some point you realize it's not art--it's propaganda and it's not faithful to what life is really like, or what humans really do. Then you just feel used. And to top it all off: how utterly revolting to watch her enjoy her ill-gotten gains in the end! What a nightmare.

Hmm, how to give this movie a rating it so richly deserves?  The scenery is wonderfully shot, authentic to its core but, it's not the scenery you wish to see it's the characters development that keeps you so invested in this movie.  It's not a Hallmark movie, not even a traditional british dry sense of humor movie.. it's poignant, articulated about our basic rights as humans to chose our destiny wth dignity.

I received the book & movie for my birthday back in January, but haven't had a chance to read the book just yet & decided to put the movie on as background noise while I pack. Let's just say I didn't get a whole lot of packing done. This movie was phenomenal. I am not one to cry during movies unless there's a dog dying, but this one tugged on my heart strings! The actors were extraordinary, I felt. Emilia Clark (Lou) was quirky & awkward at times, I though - but it made her character all the more lovable. & honestly, I loved Will's character from the beginning. I wasn't sure who to feel bad for; him or her?! Naturally I'm thinkin ""ok fine, he promised his parents 6 more months, but now they're in love .. can't he give her at least 6 more mos."" - so I feel bad for her because obviously she's so in love; but then I feel bad for him because he's clearly (once again) so in love yet still unhappy with how he has to live life. Ughhhhhhh .. it really is a heartbreaking yet beautifully romantic movie. I can't wait to read the book; I imagine my heart will burst just as much reading it, if not more!

7747697,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"If you think about it, there are not many movies about quadriplegics in Hollywood.  Here we have one, the main actor is cute and we think the girl is going to give him a new lease on life, and help him accept his condition.  However, that is not the case, he decides selfishly that he wants to die cause he can't ski in the Alps anymore, I guess.  He is super rich and goes off to some facility in Switzerland that I guess, kills you for money, but in a nice way.  Basically, what this tells disabled people is that you can't have any quality of life even if you are super rich and can take private planes places, so you might as well die.  All the people associated with this film and story should be ashamed.

How can one reconcile that this guy had it all, and is intelligent and thoughtful yet has so little value for intellectual pursuits and travel that he wants to off himself despite not having to worry financially about any of his medical expenses and care. This movie is a slap in the face to paraplegics that have many struggles including financial to survive and get through their days. I am also thinking of a young soldier in my state who lost both his legs and his arms and is doing amazing things to live for his family - his wife and children. He too, was handsome and strong physically but also mentally - this guy could have gotten back into his career, written books, traveled and other intellectual pursuits all while having someone dote on him and actually love him for who he was, as he was - all while being very wealthy and not having the kinds of cares the vast majority of us have with finances. The other thing that is highly implausible is how he cut his arm to commit suicide?! Really?! If he could do that much cutting to leave a deep scar that needed stitches, heck - all he needed was his mouth and one hand to satisfy his doting love interest - but no, the male protagonist and the movie lacked imagination, was cliche and obviously on a mission to advocate for euthanasia of disabled people.

No.  Also, there were some pretty crude, sexualized language -so parents beware.",1495756800,4,405,4.36
7747702,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"I loved the actress in the movie.  The character of Clark was wonderful, quirky and kind.  I thought the male lead did a great job portraying the change from irritable invalid to someone willing to enjoy life and fall in love...but then, wait, he still isn't willing to be positive or enjoy life.  He's a selfish SOB who wants to use a woman to make his final days more enjoyable and then kill himself because his life is too hard and he doesn't like it.

I agree with the disabled people who objected to the film.  Depression and suicide attempts are not uncommon after paralysis.  But the solution is not to help a disabled person die but to give them what they need to live to their fullest.  If there is pain, give decent care to alleviate it.  If there is illness, treat it.  When he died, I think I was supposed to feel sad, but I just felt disgusted.  (I don't mind a tragic movie.  If he had tried to stay alive for her but then tragically died anyway, that is something I would have bawled my eyes out for.)

Honestly, the story doesn't even make sense.  Someone who no longer wants to live doesn't fight off illness, he gives in and succumbs.  He could have signed a DNR and no life support and just died from the next illness he got.  If he wanted to die, he didn't need a grandiose trip and suicide to do it.

But I can't respect a man who doesn't have the courage to live once his perfect life is disrupted by hardship.  If he had made the decision to die, at the very least, he should not have used a woman along the way.  He should have sent her away before she came to care for him.  If he is that cowardly and selfish, I just can't respect him.

Oh, but it's all supposed to be okay, because he gave her money and introduced her to the ""finer things"" in life, turned a sow's ear with a heart of gold into a silk purse full of cash.  Ugh, the ending... not only did he die, he then gave her money.  Blech.

Two stars for the great character of Louisa Clark.  Nothing else worth seeing here.",1495756800,3,2006,4.177545691906006

The conclusion of this movie makes a mockery of love and a mockery of its audience, who are asked to be ""moved"" by the necrophilic message of the film.

Yes, human weakness, self-doubt and despair eat away at our lives. The one hope we have is love, which this movie summarily (in one short scene on the beach) obliterates.

I would not judge someone for making that choice, because that would be between him and God, but they seem to make it out as that is just fine and normal.  There are many people out there in worst condition, that did not take that plunge.  Also, maybe this actor looks too healthy or does not display the level of pain and despair you would need to see for such a choice.

Her facial contortions are too extreme and her desperate quirkiness borders on crazy. Sam Claflin is far too healthy looking to be playing a person that is supposed to be so weak from repeated bouts of pneumonia. Neither was I convinced that William was in such great pain regarding his existence. I think his decision was cowardly. He had all the perks of a wealthy life and could have done much for others. All he thought about was himself, which makes true love between these characters impossible. I guess with her craziness and his selfishness, they constitute a perfect modern couple.

7747765,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"Let me say up front I did not know this was a book and have not read the book. I can only evaluate the movie. I wish movie summaries would be more honest about the type of movie you are about to watch. I guess I should have read the reviews first. I am not sorry I watched this movie, but it has made me really sad. The concept that the worth of a person can be replaced by money and new experiences is disturbing. This movie uses the trappings of love and hope to tell us that life is not worth living if it does not measure up to an arbitrary standard. Who sets the standard? When do we start giving up because we hate our job--or are too short? When I think of all the people struggling in the world today and then look at this character who, with every economic advantage, could only see what he didn't have I am sickened. When did the struggle stop being worth it? Our lives are not measured by how many recreational sports we can master, but how we love and treat one another. The main character took the love of that girl and threw it away because she was less important than him. In reality, he still didn't ""see"" her; he used her. When did great love stop being about self-sacrifice--dying to self for the one you love--and start being about getting everything you can from the people around you and then checking out when life isn't as fulfilling as you think it should be?

This is a visually beautiful movie and well acted, but it is all window dressing--ironically lovingly created--for a story meant to tell us each of us has no innate value as a person. That there is no worth in becoming more or bigger than what we think we are.

We are surrounded by any entertainment we could want but our imaginations have become so small. Struggle and pain are supposed to show us the strength we didn't know we had--make us greater than we ever imagined we could be. Money and power don't buy that, adversity does. I think most of us still know this instinctively but it really is easier to just give up. And when they make it look like heaven on earth why not?

The world is full of heroes because they refused to give up. I am sorry there are movies like this out there selling humanity out for a chance to sit at a cafe in Paris and buy expensive perfume in a quirky outfit. Despite Lou's smile in the end don't you think she would rather have experienced Paris with Will? Have grown into a person she didn't know she had in her with him--watching him grow maybe because of her? The peace on her face at the end was a joke and insulting to anyone who has ever loved someone or been loved.",1495152000,133,2596,4.240404040404041

Perhaps, because of my own personal experiences, I was completely blindsided by the ending. I have a cousin who has been a quad for almost 4 decades. He has been able to carve out a meaningful life although it has been a difficult journey. He has even married 10 years ago.

I only reason I gave it two stars was because the characters were compelling and the acting was very good. However, the ending was more than tragic. It was as if his life lost value when he became disabled. The ending made it appear that assisted suicide can be a beautiful thing.  Do away with the person who is struggling and it will, in the end, be good for all involved. This insinuation is egregious to say the
 least. The ending took what was deplorable and tried to wrap it all up  a neat little bow. It was as if the female lead character was supposed to ""take heart"" and do something good with her life as a result. Really????

7747833,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"**SPOILERS**

I just watched that stupid romantic drama You Before Me. It was a great film, about a girl who works to take care of a quadriplegic young Brit who use to be an active hunk. Of course hes an ass and shes super patient, then naturally they fall in love and she ends her relationship with her bf of 7 years to be with the rich quad dude because she thinks she can stop him from not wanting to go through with an assisted suicide. So she takes him on trips and stuff, thinking that if he finds happiness with her, he may want to live and live happy with her instead of killing himself. Shes willing to give up all her own ambitions to be with him and make him happy and help him live. And yet in the end, he won't let her. He still goes with it. Because he doesnt want her to regret not pursuing her own life to be with him. SO SPOILER ALERT! He goes through with the assisted suicide, but low and behold, he gives her dad a much-needed job and her a bank account full of money to go live her life. Awwwwww, everyone says. How nice of him, you all say. How selfless of him you say. But you know what I say?

RUBBISH!

Hes a selfish a**hole. He falls into the category of selfish men that if they cant be happy with themselves if they're not able to pursue their own ambitions. Theyre incapable of seeing how their selfishness makes others unhappy. This girl was ready, READY, to give up everything she thought she wanted and needed to be with a man she fell for. She didn't need the effing trip to Paris. She didn't need his legs or his arms to work. She just wanted and needed him and that feeling she gets when she's with him, and desires that he feels the same. She spent 7 years in a boring and somewhat superficial relationship with another selfish dude who all he cared about were triathlons and working out, and despite his good health she didn't really love him because they had little in common and he never put her needs and her desires before his. Well, the quad dude seems to get her, get her quirks, and enjoys them and cherishes them. But could he be happy with the happy-go-lucky selfless girl and just live his life for the sake of seeing and making her happy?

No.

He couldn't bare to never ride a motorcycle again, nor swim, no ski, nor all that other bullshit he thought made a great life. Love was not bigger than that.

Typical.

I recently read about the Japanese men who once they fail in life in one way or another, to not feel shame in the eyes of their family and society, they run away.

GROWN MEN. RUNNING AWAY.

Theres a whole business out of helping grown men run away in Japan, to help hide their shame.

They don't care who they leave behind.

They don't care about their children or their wives or the people that loved them unconditionally.

No. Because so long as they cant bare to see their own faces, they will just effing run away and abandon everyone who loved them, for the sake of not going through the motions in life where you get to spare some dignity and grow some courage and learn to redeem yourself and start over, and be your own hero and everyones hero again, for the people that just cared that you tried. And why would you do it? Because they love you.

Instead, these kinds of men run away to not bare the sight of their own visage when they wake up. Yet they cant see when the women in their lives are willing to look past that and just be with them unconditionally. Because as strong as we are, we often put our own needs behind that or our counterparts in order to give THEM hope, THEM dignity, THEM courage to fight on. We lie, we placate, we do everything we can to help put them back up on the pedestals they want to be on, and yet we do it with sincere compassion and love. And the only time they disappoint us is when they don't effing try. And then when they disappoint us, they SHAME us for not understanding. And WE end up looking like the a**holes. WE end up looking selfish for not letting these men wallow in their own self-pity.

We encounter men like this in our lives all the time and we've come to think it's normal, but it's not. Why do we let ourselves into this vicious cycle over and over again? It's our own fault. Because we love, because we care, because were selfless that we still try in hopes that ONE DAY that man will effing wake up, realize all you did to sacrifice your own needs and desires and put forth their happiness before yours, and maybe, JUST MAYBE, when you need someone selfless to step in in your own personal (yet likely temporary) time of need, they will be there for you like you were there for them. Then, we're surprised when they don't.

We don't learn.

We don't effing learn.

That film was stupid.

It was a stupid film.

""Me before You"" is certainly an appropriate title: the male protagonist does nothing but indulge his own selfish desires, in spite of the pain it causes others.  This movie advocates the worthless, meaningless value that we should place on persons who become ""damaged goods"".  In this movie, a young man with looks, money, family, job, social status, etc becomes a quadriplegic and  decides that if he can't still have all those attributes, then there really is no point in living. An apologetic for assisted suicide, this movie attempts to romanticize killing oneself.  This movie indulges the idea that living on one's own terms is the only worthwhile sort of life.  It is indeed, a very shallow, superficial, degrading, foolish point of view, and is dangerous to any who may be  less than perfect in some regard.

7747844,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"Spoilers...One star is too generous.  Great potential, but an abysmal and evil ending.  The movie is aptly titled, as the utterly self absorbed Will Traynor says, ""Me"" relentlessly over the loving objections of the ""yous"" in his life.  His parents,  friends,  and ""beloved"" selflessly devote themselves to his care and attempt to give him hope and see his worth.  He insists they cater to his desires even when he knows he's asking pain of them.  Apparently the script writers didn't see the irony in having Will urge Clark to ""live life to the full"" and with hope,  even though he refused to do those same things.  Perhaps they meant to impress on us the mental illness of the suicidal?",1491177600,4,687,4.705882352941177

7747851,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"Entertaining, sweet movie. Will it win any academy awards? No. But it is surprisingly thoughtful, deals with a subject matter that is usually avoided in lighter movies due to it's complexity, and the acting is genuine and charming. I was especially appreciative of the lack of judgment placed on some of the choices that were made, one in particular (you'll see). The leads have a very sweet and lovely chemistry, and there's nothing shmaltzy and stupid about the writing or directing. Would even watch it again.....",1490832000,5,516,5.011627906976744

I understand some writers try to make movies or stories different from others, but this was just awful and very disappointing. I felt like I wasted my time watching the whole movie and I can't get my time back. What an awful way to end the movie and what an awful love story (the ending just ruined it for me). The writer should have done better. What a terrible message the movies sends, and what a terrible way to end and ruin a good story. I hope there is like a continuation or something like he went away somewhere, and this was just a way of him to wear off the responsibility of his parents and Clark to take care of him so they can live freely.",1490054400,2,779,4.158940397350993

7747919,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"Ridiculous story line. I felt this was a propaganda film for euthanasia. This guy has everything he could possibly want including wealth and family that loves him but because he is paralyzed, he doesn't want to live. This is NOT a story of the triumph of the human spirit, but one of a self-centered, woe is me type of story line. The character could have used his influences to help others, less fortunate and would have found a new fire in living. He would have seen that there were others in the world far worse off than he was. He could have made a difference. It would have been a more sellable idea if he had been poor and desolate with no supportive family or friends. I am glad they didn't do that, because with God there is always hope. Many people do get healed from being paralyzed and from deadly diseases. They are called miracles.",1488844800,12,844,4.416666666666667

7747996,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"My first review. sorry for the bad grammar and mess below.

Summing up the movie in 2 words: Glorifying Euthanasia.
If you or someone you know is paralyzed and think life isn't worth living anymore, this is definitely the movie for you.  You will be encouraged to pull the plug and get yourself 6 feet under the ground before you can say ""Ground Hog Day""

What message is this sending to the thousands if not millions who are paralyzed? HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE...
to combat this story, i would suggest looking up books and movies about a woman who was paralyzed in her teens and still lives today in her 60's
her name is:

Joni Eareckson Tada

Look her up.  Read her biography.  Watch a movie about her.  Be uplifted and moved by what God can do through lifes difficulties.  Or give up and give in.  To a similar pointless fate of the male character in this horrible movie.

Now my rating is based only on the message.  It is filmed nicely with pretty good actors and actresses.  And the movie sort of keeps you hoping for that ending.. but no, they go there.. and that is what ruined it for us.  So hopefully our one star will pull this movie down a notch of a star and eventually low enough that most people will skip it. Because no good can come from this movie.  Truely..",1486252800,3,1278,4.378723404255319

7747998,4,B01F5ZY3JI,"A mix of hope and hopelessness, giving and selfishness, potential and poverty of spirit. A truly sad tale of self-focus, an attempt to expand beyond that, only to fail. Love does not always win.",1486252800,,194,4.735294117647059
7747999,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"This would have been a great movie if not for the terrible ending. When a woman falls in love with you and not your disability, appreciate it. Will is a selfish person and gave up a good woman who was willing to stand by his side every step of the way. But noo he chose the selfish route and chose to die. Will lost his brain not his ability to function !!

7748008,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"This film is deceivingly beautiful.  There are beautiful people, beautiful clothes, and beautiful compositions sweeping the scenes.  The idea seems very sweet.  A spunky villager gets hired to work for the town's richest family as a caretaker for the drop dead gorgeous wheel-chair bound son.  Inevitably, they fall in love.  I love cheesy loves stories as much as the next person, but this movie was so high handed with its advocacy of assisted suicide.

The main male character was a man with no problems--he had money, looks, a girlfriend and he spent his days doing incredible and invigorating things.  He would cliff dive or surf or ski or whatever else he felt like.  Then he was hit by a vehicle and turned into a quadriplegic with some difficult medical complications.  As the film goes on, we learn he has attempted suicide already and has promised his mother a specific length of time before he will definitely take his own life so that she has a chance to say goodbye and potentially change his mind.  She hires this cute spunky girl to take care of him in hopes she will convince him to want to live.

Spoiler alert, she doesn't convince him.  He says life isn't worth living if he can't live the way he did before.

This movie is such garbage.  The main character is upset because he can't live the selfish life he is used to living.  He doesn't think about what he has to offer the world, only what he can't experience anymore.  He is rich, gorgeous, and has a family that loves him and a young woman who is deeply in love with him.  He could do charity, teach, learn more about the world and focus less on his own deficits.  There are people who never get a fraction of the opportunities and talents he has, but he still decides life has nothing to offer him.  The movie makes it seem like it is a beautiful choice as his family is around him in a white light filled room as he passes away.  He writes a sweet letter to his girlfriend and she should be happy and tethered without him.  Real life is messy and ugly and painful.  Nobody gets through life without being devastated and heartbroken.  Why is he so special that he gets to bow out so early?  I don't like the moral of this story.  I think it tells people that life isn't worth much and that pain and suffering shouldn't be put up with.

7748087,2,B01F5ZY3JI,I found it annoying. Wish they had taken more risks and gone deeper with the subject matter. It felt like a Disney movie that stays on the surface of the story and only worries about making the actress look cute. I think this movie was beneath Emilia Clarke.,1485648000,,258,4.395833333333333

However, it stopped playing halfway through.. as in chapter 13 then went to that annoying blue screen at the end. The only reason I am able to say it was a good movie is because I ended up buying it at our local Walmart for $8, which is what I should have just done to begin with.",1485302400,,407,4.037037037037037

There are many non-fiction accounts of individuals who have achieved greatness despite life altering events...composers who continued to compose despite going deaf, musicians who continued to play instruments even though they lost their eyesight, etc. The quadriplegic character in this movie is very likeable, but his decision to end his life because he is unable to mourn his former life and move forward, is tragic.",1485302400,,664,4.9375

It's accomplishes its mission of being both adorable and a tearjerker, and is worth your time if you don't worry too much about the bigger message or implications (if indeed one was intended), and focus in on the surprisingly good chemistry between the leads and the otherwise solid cast (Charles Dance!).

7748314,3,B01F5ZY3JI,"Honestly, I wanted to love this movie, but I couldn't! I read the book first, which is why I didn't really like it.

It is a tragic story, and may be a tearjerker for some people.  If you like Nicolas Sparks movies and/or romantic comedies, you'll probably enjoy this film.

Emilia Clarke's performance is very good, and it somewhat makes up for an otherwise mediocre and predictable movie.  I can only recommend this film to die hard romance fans.  Otherwise, meh.",1483142400,,523,4.820224719101123

7748430,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie is hardly worth rating at all. Super disappointed and evil, selfish ending. I am sorry I paid any money to rent it. The trailer was deceptive. It had so much potential to promote life and love in any circumstance but failed miserably. If I had this mindset when being diagnosed with cancer at age 24, I would have missed out on 28 years (and counting) of amazing love, life and experiences of growth and transformation. I would not ever  recommend this movie.  :(",1482710400,15,474,4.564705882352941

This movie definitely opened my eyes to the difficulties of Will's injuries and how a simple accident could change his life completely. It helped me to better understand his decision to have an assisted death. While watching this movie, in the back of my mind I had hoped that Lou would be able to save Will, but I knew in the end he would get his way. It's a great story and the quirkyness of Lou is refreshing. The only issue I had with the movie was separating the actors from their better known characters (Emilia as Daenerys Targaryen and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom).",1481587200,,702,4.449612403100775

I'm very disappointed that he takes his life. It's a little but Hollywood. I think being disabled and having a romance is very difficult, but it is very possible. Also she's so idealized, I've literally never met anyone like her. I felt so sad afterwards. Because he caved in. He gave up. So many people fight so hard to stay alive, so much, and he had something to live for.",1481155200,,564,4.380952380952381

I read the book previous to watching the movie, and can say the movie true to the book, and even better than the movie ( the music). I would recommend to all women , also to men in committed relationships.  They will get it.

Think every quad wants to kill themselves?  That is not the norm.  Watch Murderball- a much, much better movie about disability. How this movie should have ended- his family or his caregiver make him see a shrink. He struggles with his lack of function and his identity but gradually gains some acceptance of his ""new normal"". He joins a quad rugby team and at first can barely push a chair (but obviously he has some core- he's sitting up in that chair through the movie all by himself).  With perseverance he gets better and eventually becomes a low-pointer at the Paralympics. Or just a really good player. Or really just make up any ending where he doesn't kill himself.

On the right day, mood, this is therapy. I got a good cry out that had been under my skin for awhile.
I can't remember the last time a movie made me do that. This reminds me more of ""Beaches"" than a modern romance drama. Worthy of a purchase, worthy of at least a rental.",1480464000,,329,4.076923076923077

7748683,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I can honestly say this movie had every ounce of my attention. Yes the main character is a female, however, the plot is wrapped around him. From my personal view of myself as a man, being able to do things even as menial as making my own food, getting around on my own, dance with the woman I love... Those are a few of the things that make everything else seem possible. When the hard times come, it's the minor things that you have control of that make it bearable. If I couldn't do those things, however selfish it may be, I would have the thought if not the motive to end my life. For someone to have to wait on me 24/7 would be unbearable. I would be a ball and chain to the people I love/love me weather they felt that way or not. It brought relief in the end, when you are able to see her living her life to the fullest of it's potential. After all, what is the point of having a life if we don't?",1480377600,3,904,4.0

7748687,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"By the time this movie ended, I really hated this movie. A wonderful, optimistic, giving person fails to persuade a proud, spoiled, cowardly, selfish person. She was better off with out him. And the parents just stood by and threw their hands up. What a terrible, worthless story.

I am convinced you can find happiness and fulfillment despite any disability, if you are willing to be open to positive possibilities in life. I bet any prisoner in Auschwitz 1944 would have traded places with this young man in an instant.",1480291200,5,521,4.788888888888889

7748689,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"I saw the preview and got inspired to read the book, which I loved. It made me cry which is kind of hard to do. I watched the movie after reading the book and they did quite a fine job at portraying the book, which can sometimes not happen. There were just a few slight changes to things but hat could be chalked up to time, money, and whether or not they were able to find actors for the parts.",1480204800,,395,3.95
7748690,2,B01F5ZY3JI,"I really wanted to like this movie, but the ending just shocked me. The acting is good and the storyline was promising, but the message of assisted suicide as an alternative option to life is terrible!
I admit, I can not imagine how hard it must be for a person so severely handicapped to live on a daily basis, that is true, but so many people have to die, no matter if they loved their ""old life"" or not.  Thousands do not have a choice, and to make a choice like this is just terrible.
My little sister was half of her life in and out of hospitals and she would have given anything to live longer, even with the pain and suffering she had to endure; but in the end she had no choice.
As Lou states in one of the movie scenes: ""You have changed my life from the moment I met you."" All people, disabled or not have an impact on humanity, it is not up to us to make the decision when to start this nor when to end it.",1480204800,4,917,3.983695652173913
7748691,5,B01F5ZY3JI,I truly loved this movie. It was an expression of unconditional love. This kind of love only a few people experience in a lifetime. It moved my heart and brought me to tears. I also wanted Will to choose life. He allowed Lou to live an amazing 6 months doing things she would have never been able to had they not me.t She brought a gentle smile and laughter back into his life.,1480204800,,377,4.178082191780822

7748703,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"This movie is very touching.  Sometimes a person just needs a good tissue box holding movie and this is one of them.  The dark side is the successful business man who career and quality of life is torn from him in a tragic accident. On the better side is how his companion touches him and he encourages her personal growth and talents.  Then there are the parents the father who wants his sons wishes to be followed to take away his pain and the mother who hopes against hope that he will change his course of action if the right companion could be found to change his mind.  So if you like a movie with multiple facets this is wonderful well rounded movie.  Loved it, rented it first  and I am going to purchase it so I can watch again and again.  I almost forgot for us GoT fans Emilia Clarke plays a sweet gentle child like girl like the girl you think is behind the Mother of Dragons.  She is joined by another GoT actor who plays a kind loving father versus the power hungry man who would eat his young if it would bring him more power head of the Lannister clan. While his role in the film is limited the depth of the love the character has for his son is felt through out the movie.",1480118400,,1189,4.1615720524017465

7748818,1,B01F5ZY3JI,"I will write a very unpopular review that is also uncomfortable to read --  so you might want to stop here. If not, trudge on but SPOILER ALERT! I felt ripped off after paying for this movie because it is a lie. Now there is a lot to like about the movie - and because of that the movie draws you into what you think will be a life-affirming premise. Instead, it's the old 'bait and switch."" After enticing the viewer to become invested in the harsh reality of what a quadriplegic's life is like and how that life starts to improve with the addition of a generous and loving friend - it then begins to weave a web of lies around it's premise by leaving out the reality of what happens when someone who is loved decides to end their life. As a mother who lost a son at the age of 18, I can tell you that no true girlfriend is going to put on red lipstick and live it up in Paris on the money of the deceased. No - if she truly loved him, she'd become numb with grief, go through a period of horrid survivor guilt, most likely suffer from arrested development and have to deal with a surreal outlook on life that traps one into a state of paralyzed horror. And that lasts for a long time - usually 10 years, if they are l ucky.  And why, oh why, do we not see the parents after their son is helped to murder himself? Why? Because they are probably sitting in their closets WEEPING UNCONTROLLABLY trying to muster the courage to stand up and walk out of their front door. I best say no more - but it's movies like this that try to put a bandaid on a gaping shotgun wound. Keep your damn bandaid and get a clue.",1479081600,164,1607,4.082278481012659

7748963,5,B01F5ZY3JI,"This is a wonderful movie to watch! It is kind of special in its own way, mainly due to the fact that the main character, Louisa Clark, receives a job caring for a quadriplegic, Will Traynor. I feel like this adds an element of uniqueness to the movie, one that cannot be found in many other places.

The movie has a lot of color and the scenes have a lot of light, which I greatly appreciate, since it just keeps adding to the movie. Also, there are several contrasts in this film. For instance, Will Traynor is now a sarcastic and sadden fellow while Louisa Clark is chatty, optimistic, and has a very delightful sense of fashion, which propels both characters forwards. Additionally, the movie is wonderfully created, happy, funny, and has a sad ending but this doesn't make it a bad movie. In fact, even though it sounds horrible to say, the ending kind of works with the movie because it can relate more to reality than can a positive happily-ever-after.

Even though I personally think the book is better than the film (like usually), this movie is a great piece of creativity that should be shared with everyone, no matter the emotions that are the result!",1478044800,7,1163,4.586538461538462

She was beyond irritating and her performance is so unbelievable it's laughable.  There is no nuance or any depth in her performance.  This movie requires just that in it's star.  She acted like she was on stage playing Peter Pan.  What a ridiculous performance.  Her co-star was excellent and I could almost see him wincing at her overbearing acting.  He's worth watching, but she's like fingernails scratching a chalkboard.  What could have been a good movie with a good message was tanked by her every move.  And the ending will be hard for a lot of people to take, regardless of Emilia's lack of integrity.  What the director was thinking in allowing her to get away with this performance is beyond me.
