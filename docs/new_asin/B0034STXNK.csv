8526973,1,B0034STXNK,"Probably the worst training DVD ever... It's basically ""check out this sweet house I live in, and these cool cars I drive"" Sorry, I don't define the quality of a program based on the amount of money the guy who made it has... AAAAAAND as with most bodybuilding programs like this IT WILL NOT WORK FOR NATURAL ATHLETES! Body part splits DO NOT WORK, if you wanna be a monster without steroids you're going to have to use heavy compound(multi-joint) movemants and you're going to have to increase your training frequency to more than each body part once per week... Don't waste your money, buy Practical Programming by Mark Rippetoe instead!",1435536000,5,639,4.7657657657657655
