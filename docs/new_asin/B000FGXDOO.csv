8122457,5,B000FGXDOO,"A hilarious story of a man who makes noise effects for a living and one night stumbles upon a woman and the comedy begins...
She is a ""social worker""...she gets paid to help certain persons with certain needs: the baker, the necrophilic couple, the twins, diaper boy/man, etc.
The male character barely utters any dialog and communicates through sound effects through out the film.  One day he stumbles upon the woman again and helps her during one her many work tasks...the client finds this extra person very arousing and demand that he must be present for any future job; so she seeks him again to assist her with her jobs.
Then somewhere he starts his transformation into a cartoon as he falls madly in love with the female character...
As advised in the previous review this is a film for a mature, open minded audience and not intended for minors.
