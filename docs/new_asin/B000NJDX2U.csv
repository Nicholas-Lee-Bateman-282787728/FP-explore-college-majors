When I gave my review to the sender they were quick to point out the ""editorial"" discription.  Looks like this problem has come up before.  It was a complete waste of money because I can do NOTHING with it.",1325808000,2,292,4.160714285714286
8178134,5,B000NJDX2U,"One of the greatest times we spent with our boys was watching Life with Louie. I agree with the others, Louie, we love you and your work. Please put more of your shows on DVD, especially the Christmas show. So much fun and laughter. So much better than the trash we see today.",1323561600,3,276,4.226415094339623
8178135,5,B000NJDX2U,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I used to watch this series all the
time-last time was repeats on Saturdays and have to tried to find the
DVD's everywhere. Someone PLEASE tell Louie Anderson to get all of
this series on DVD!",1220400000,5,228,4.4523809523809526
8178136,5,B000NJDX2U,"I have wanted to have Louie on DVD for some time. My kids and I watched this show every week before it was cancelled. We even taped a number of the episodes and the kids still love watching them. One thing I would suggest is that more than one episode per DVD. I have seen Lake Winnibigoshish and it's a riot. I loved every episode and can't wait till they come out, I will buy them all, and please Louie, do extra stuff, I would love to hear from you on more of this, and go back on TV  I really miss this show!",1181347200,7,512,3.923076923076923
