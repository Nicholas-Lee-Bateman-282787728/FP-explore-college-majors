2748873,5,B000MTUPVS,Hands down the best comedy series ever.  Brilliantly written and casted. This DVD need to be made available to the US market (US Format).,1202774400,6,137,4.708333333333333
2748874,5,B000MTUPVS,"WARNING to US Buyers:  Green Wing is not politically correct, or sensored in any way, so nothing is sacred.  This is not for the ""sensitive types""!  With that, Green Wing is the Crack of English humor.  The episodes run the gamut from psychotic to hallucinogenic and I find myself laughing uncontrollably, wishing that the US TV sensors would allow something like this to air.",1187740800,12,376,4.828125

8172352,5,B000MTUPVS,"Streaming Netflix has opened up the doors to a lot of things I didn't know existed. This British sit-com underscores the thrill of opening those doors.

Here's the scoop. Surgeon Harriet Schulenburg is starting at a new hospital. Little does she realize she's joining the ranks of some of the most bizarre characters on the planet.

This is a major hoot. Not only is the writing as clever as all get out, but the characters are drawn very well. There are two upper middle age female managers who seem not only sex-starved but sexually creepy as well. A small pool of female office workers who each have their own quirks. Love interests and allegiances shift as the different quirks of many of the characters surface.

Then there is the odd approach to the production. Motion is, at times, sped up or slowed down giving the proceedings a peculiar rhythm. There is also a lot of jagged editing which adds to this. They also spend very little time on any one character or situation. Instead they flit from here to there, telling each story in dribs and drabs. It took me a while to adjust my radar to figure out what it was I was watching. There are some running gags that as funny as anything you're likely to see.

I cannot say enough about this. It's great at every level. Netflix has the first nine episodes. I'm hoping they can get their hands on more.",1472688000,,1354,4.514285714285714
8172353,4,B000MTUPVS,"Absolutely fantastic. Can't believe it isn't released for US sales. Got a region-free dvd player just for this show. Worth it, but the player wasn't.",1468022400,2,149,5.0

8172355,5,B000MTUPVS,I can't find it in anyother format that this not very expensive and from what I understand this is what scrubs is based on and scrubs isn't funny this is.,1415232000,,154,4.166666666666667

8172358,5,B000MTUPVS,This is absolutely superb.  Another hysterical British comedy series.  We need Amazon to have DVD Format 4 available for those of us in Australia so that we can get the second series ASAP.,1205193600,,188,4.666666666666667
8172359,5,B000MTUPVS,"Great comedy series.  I detest hospital dramas, comedies, etc.  Yet... this series is not really about doctors.  It could be set anywhere and would still be funny.  The hospital thing is just a way to tie together a bunch of sketches.  The theme is really a love story.  It has a super cast, great writing, unique style.  The music is quirky and perfect for this surreal show.  If only we could get the DVD'S in US format.  I'm tired of waiting!",1205107200,4,445,4.395061728395062
