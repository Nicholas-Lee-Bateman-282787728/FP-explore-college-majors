8679376,1,B00NNZSMUE,"I have never written a review for a film but felt inclined based on this horrid attempt at an animated children's film. I really hope this was a student project, and if it was I would still be critical but would understand you have to learn and start somewhere. Not only is the animation awful, the ""actors"" or voice-overs are the worst I have ever heard. If you have children and like to watch animated movies with them as I do, do yourself a favor and remove this one from your list. If you do rent it, or God forbid buy it, you will want to jump headfirst off a two-story building.",1426291200,,584,4.223214285714286
8679377,1,B00NNZSMUE,Characters talking about getting drunk in the movie? Really? Why is this rated PG?,1424563200,,82,4.928571428571429
8679378,1,B00NNZSMUE,"This is a terrible movie. My 4 year old picked it out at the movie rental store and she seems to have liked it. But it's awful, the plot is bad, dialogue is bad, etc. etc. Don't waste your money.",1421539200,,195,3.9
8679379,1,B00NNZSMUE,"This movie is so bad that afterwards, our entire household (3 small dogs, 2 adults and a 3.5 year old) was dumber for having watched it. The characters are weak, the script is hogwash and the storyline is confusing. Oh, and the actors who did the voiceovers seems like a band of amateurs that are unexperienced and from Mars... yes, the planet.",1421366400,,344,4.564516129032258
8679380,1,B00NNZSMUE,"made me sick to my stomach to be honest, when I rent a kids movie for my child.... I expect it to not be derogatory and involve cursing.... THIS IS WITH OUT A DOUBT THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN... It's pretty bad",1420243200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8679381,1,B00NNZSMUE,"This is, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is so bad that I was completely amazed to see number of people involved in making it because it looks like the work of a couple of deranged lunatics.  This film was made by spainards which explains a lot.",1418515200,4,263,4.137254901960785
8679382,1,B00NNZSMUE,"Really disappointed, not what I would consider ""family approved""; although the back sticker says PG for mild language and rude humor, I think it was a little out of bounds....derogatory comments abound, heard da*n, Grimm reaper stuck in for giggles, didn't like it at all",1418256000,,271,5.044444444444444
