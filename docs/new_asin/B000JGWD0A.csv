8150358,3,B000JGWD0A,The presentation format left something to be desired for the truly curious. The production quality of the filming was grainy and lacked imagination in positioning and perspective. If I were teaching a World History class on Britain I would not include any of these DVD's in the curriculum.,1359072000,,289,5.041666666666667
8150359,3,B000JGWD0A,"Celtic Britain is the perfunctory title of the set, yet there's very little focus on Celtic Britain or the Celts in general.

Mysterious Britain is a DVD with a focus more on ""Haunted Britain"". It primarily focused on the hauntings in York before moving to Stonehenge with references to it being 500,000 years old. Getting past the inaccuracies of this DVD the data supplied for Stonehenge is rather out of date, but still enjoyable and watchable for all that. I would have to say the title would have been better reflected as ""a history of Salisbury plain"".

Scotland Forever, I was anticipating a history, or at least a historical overview of the Scots. Perhaps it might have contained periodic overviews from pre-Roman times to the present day. What the DVD actually contained was an overview of the Scottish military, its exploits and its battles. While I found this actually very interesting, as it dealt with the 1600's on it certainly wasn't integral to the Celtic period.

The Welsh aspect was closest to something I'd anticipate. Wales was a grouping of Principalities in ancient times until formally conquored by Edward I. It is a land that is struggling towards a semblance of Nationhood in our present day, but even that movement was not explored in depth.

They are three watchable DVD's with a few inaccuracies, the biggest issue is the overarching misnomer in the title. Apart from some references to Arthurian legend there was little relevance to Celtic Britain.

The misnaming cost it one star, the inaccuracies another and it almost lost a third by being average in production quality and references.

If you are interested in the subjects it really does contain you will enjoy it, if you're wanting details on Celtic history you might find these rather lacking, the total Celtic references accross the three DVD's could handily fit into 1/2 of one disc.",1327190400,8,1872,4.926984126984127
