8618407,5,B00FRVEKHQ,John Bridcut must be the best classical music documentarian working today.  This film is another excellent addition to his oeuvre.  The problem with doing a documentary on a composer like Britten is that so many have already been made.  Yet Bridcut finds new ground to till.  This film deals with Britten's race with death as he battles to finish his final masterpieces before his health fails him.  The production values are wonderful...filled with great interviews and musical performances.  It's a moving film.  A must for any Britten fan.,1390262400,15,542,5.090909090909091
