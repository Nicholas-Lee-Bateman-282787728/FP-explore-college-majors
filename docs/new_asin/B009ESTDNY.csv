After watching this video I realized that these guys live less than an hour away from me.  Dan and his family have a lot of tractor repair videos on YouTube, and they do a great job.",1449705600,,294,4.327272727272727
8540741,5,B009ESTDNY,"I'll start by saying, I've had some engine rebuilding experience, so I'm not a total beginner at this kind of thing. I'm in the middle of rebuilding the engine of my 1950 Allis-Chalmers B, and I was looking for a video to help clear up a couple of questions I had in my mind. I must say, Dan and Scott make it look so easy. After viewing this video I'm not afraid to tear into the engine and get my hands dirty.

The only thing I noticed was a small contradiction in their instructions. At about 1:05:40 into the video, Dan is talking about putting the rocker arm studs back into the head. He tells you, be sure to put the stud with the groove in it in the rear most hole. He is correct. It needs to be there to allow oil to reach the cylinder head. The minor bit of contradiction occurs about 5 minutes later, at about 1:10:50 in the video, when Dan says to be sure to put the grooved stud in the front.... except he's pointing to the rear... Just so there's no confusion, it does need to be in the REAR hole.

Other than that small slip, I think the video is very well done. Dan and Scott give complete and easy to understand instructions. A nice quality product!

Thanks!",1363651200,2,1174,4.185840707964601
