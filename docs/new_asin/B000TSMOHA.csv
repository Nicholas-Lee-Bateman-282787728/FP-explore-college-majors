8210727,5,B000TSMOHA,"Picking up where it left off GTO Semester 2 hops right into the story of Onizuka, the baddest, toughest, and perhaps craziest teacher ever to walk into a school. Onizuka may have won over some of his class but he's got a long way to go before he can declare victory. Between students who still want to see him gone, teachers that don't trust him, and vice principle who trys to get him fired at every turn ex-biker teacher but watch his back. Filled with more fun and adventures if you like the first season this is a must have.",1366070400,,528,4.29

8210731,5,B000TSMOHA,"GTO's popularity can never be doubted. When I was still a university student, I heard of it from a lot of people, my classmates, the people around who watched or were gonna watch were talking about it, the broadcast review,etc. Later on, it had TV drama with superstar as Onizuka. And the drama is very popular too. It is an excellent anime, with a lot of meaningful contents. The story is very funny. In addition, it reflects the beautiful sides and ugly sides of the people in society, specifically in Japan(of course, it is a Japanese anime). In reality, it is important not to look at people's appearance only or judge people with one glance. Onizuka is an anime character which does not exists in reality but his actions are inspiring, even though we can never imitate those actions in reality. For some of the moments, I had tears around eye corner when students with poor past were saved and started to have new vision about him/herself and with the surroundings. 'Tashikani', people are always with a past, no matter it is good or bad, we must learn how to gain from the past and not dwell within the past.",1203724800,4,1114,4.575
