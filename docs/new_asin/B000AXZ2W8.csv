8080286,3,B000AXZ2W8,"A very brief note to comment that this is a pleasant movie with a positive social message, suitable for most children over 8 or so. It looked as though it was dubbed, but I could find no reference to this on the box.",1205971200,4,216,4.046511627906977
8080287,4,B000AXZ2W8,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE ON DVD, BUT NOW ALSO OWN IT ON VHS VIDEO TOO! GOOD FAMILY ACTION ""TEEN"" MOVIE THAT HAS AN ALL CANADIAN CAST, BUT IS IN ENGLISH(NO SUBTITLES). IT ALL TAKES PLACE AT ""BLACK LAKE"", SOMEWHERE IN CANADA, & INVOLVES A ""FEUD"" THAT THE ""BRAINLESS"" PARENTS STARTED, BUT NOW USE THEIR CHILDREN TO BATTLE OUT IN THE WOODS. THE KIDS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS; THE CONQUISTADORS vs THE INDIANS, & CONSIST OF MOSTLY PRECOCIOUS TEENS; BOY & GIRLS FROM 10-15 YEARS OF AGE. THE ""HIDDEN FORTRESS"" IS THE PRIZE TO CAPTURE, HOLD OR DEFEND. BOTH GROUPS HAVE WARRIORS, SPIES & NEUTRAL OBSERVERS WHO ALSO PATCH-UP THE INJURED. WATCH FOR THEIR SECRET WEAPON; A ""BEE BOMB"" THAT'S DELIVERED WITH UNEXPECTED CONCEQUENCES. EVENTUALLY, THE ""KIDS"" CONVINCE THEIR PARENTS THAT FEUDING IS STUPID, WHICH RESULTS IN A HAPPY ENDING. BACK OF THE BOX CLAIMS THAT THIS MOVIE HAS WON ""FIVE INTERNATIONAL AWARDS"", SO ""SAFE"" FOR ALL AGES!? RECOMMENDED!!!",1104364800,3,936,4.8930817610062896
