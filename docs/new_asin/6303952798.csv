738496,4,6303952798,"The actor performances were excellent,  especially Daryll Hannah and Moira Kelly.  The movie is never boring and I feel it is very underrated. The ending is full of fiery action and I think that it is one of the better  thrillers(more than Single White Female and Fatal Attraction).  I'd  reccommend it.  The color ,  pans, and tilts in the cinematography along  with the music make the film very intimate and enjoyable.",929318400,10,420,4.816901408450704

738676,2,6303952798,"I could not believe what I was hearing from this disc! I thought my ears were messed up, then I thought my tv audio was messed up. Then I did a search online to confirm I was not the only one with this complaint. There is this echoing sound throughout the entire movie that sounds like a jet overhead or underwater whooshing, to an echoing in a cave, or the hissing of a flare. It is the worst audio I have ever heard on any format ever produced by a professional distributor. We should all be refunded for the cost of this item and replaced for free! The sound makes this movie nearly unbearable. This product has just lowered the bar on blu ray expectations.",1358121600,5,660,4.288
738677,1,6303952798,"I would have given this flick 2 stars if it weren't for the incredibly-lousy soundtrack. All variations in tone were accompanied by a loud, totally-distracting swishing noise that ruined the entire movie.

I have heard audio quality this bad before. It sounds like an over-compressed MP3 -- one that was made at 8 Kbps, or less. How sound this bad ever ended up on a Blu-ray disk leaves me bewildered.

In the closing credits, there is a song with vocals, (possibly sung by The Boys Choir of St. Patrick's Cathedral) but the distortion is so bad that it is impossible to make out any of the lyrics. The credits list the 22 people responsible for this audio abomination, including Sound Mixer, Supervising Sound Editors, Sound Editors, First Assistant Sound Editor, Foley Editors, ADR Mixers, Music Editor and Re-Recording Editor.

In all fairness, the sound may have been ruined by the audio wizards at Mill Creek when they turned this movie into a Blu-ray. If there were an Academy Award for worst Blu-ray soundtrack of all time, this disk would win it, very handily.

*** SPOILER ALERT!!! ***

Lisa-Marie Chandler is in a hospital room with her ""newborn"", 6 month old child. Leann Netherwood enters her room and demands to know where Russell and Dana Clifton have taken her daughter. Then John and Leann Netherwood somehow manage to find Russell and Dana Clifton in their very remote, under-construction dream home. Apparently, Lisa-Marie drew them a map.

For the remainder of the movie, John and Leann subject Russell and Dana to a variety of tortures and set a very slow-burning fire in the house. The little girl gets to watch all of this mayhem, but she's already become accustomed to violent behavior.

Here's the part that I can't figure out. Lisa-Marie managed to provide the location of the house to Leann, but apparently, she forgot to tell the police where the house was. At least 6 police officers surround John and Leann's abandoned car in the hospital parking lot, but the police can't seem to rustle up a posse and go to the house. As a result, the police never show up, except for the one unfortunate dead officer who arrived in the stolen police car with John and Leann.",1354320000,3,2189,4.775132275132275
738678,3,6303952798,"This was a average thriller from the midnineties.
It was part of a big group of movies sold to mill creek , the cut rate cheapo company on blu ray. And like most of their blu rays there's dirt and scratches on the prints. the print itself is not a good one at all. Some of the companies stuff looks decent though. 'another stake out' looks great! 'big business' and others as well then there's 'v.i. warshawski' which looks not so good. And 'galaxina' which is trashed and then this one which has giant cuts in part of it. However most scenes are damage free so it's bearable, however the least mill creek should do is remove print damage. but nope , anyways the movie has excellent actors in it and is fast paced enough not to be boring. All of the actors in this flick are now in b movies etc but at this point they were still making lower end a movies and this is just that kind of studio effort. There is some suspense as the criminal couple try to get their kid back from the parents that are raising it. The kid is obviously better off , just as most kids we be away from druggie parents, but the bioparents want her back anyways. I would say that at this low price you get what you pay for , but as a movie it's not so bad amd it was shown in  major theaters of the 1990's.",1330473600,3,1280,4.099601593625498

738680,1,6303952798,The picture is good on the blu ray but the sound has a loud background noise that resembles the sound of a waterfall in  most of the film. The disc should be recalled.,1318464000,7,167,4.0606060606060606
738681,3,6303952798,I found this film to be suspenseful even though the plot sometimes seems to be implausable. The main actors did a decent job in their roles. I would recommend the film as being entertaining but sometimes melodramatic.,1261699200,,217,4.891891891891892
738682,4,6303952798,"""I thought this movie was great, I remember I watched it some years back, but never got the movie. The two outlaw parents were crazy people and proved that they wouldn't let anything get in their way to get their daughter.""",1183075200,,223,4.463414634146342
738683,4,6303952798,"Lovely little Julia Devin as Janie, the little girl in this well crafted thriller, is the soul of this movie, and her plight and situation forms the crux of this movie.  Director Wesley Strick has added some beautiful visual scenes:  a sheet blowing in the wind; fireflies flickering in front of the vacant house; little Janie framed in a window with curtains blowing and a picturesque night sky.  Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine are ominously evil in their roles as Janie's real criminal parents; Vincent Spano and Moira Kelly offer a nice counterpoint to these evil duo and display a strong, nurturing relationship for Janie.  There are a couple of plot holes:  why didn't they ever find the social worker after her demise?  What makes Hannah turn on Carradine?  But, as far as this type of thriller goes, THE TIE THAT BINDS is a worthy entry.",1107475200,,846,4.7534246575342465
738684,4,6303952798,"""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" was a little better than
""The Tie That Binds"" but this movie is a good movie. After a couple break into a house to steal some food for their daughter and the cops show up their little daughter Janie is taken to an orphanage by the Cliftons,a decent couple who don't have any children. Problem is the Cliftons don't know that Janie's parents are outlaws and are trying to find her and will stop at nothing to do so. Even if they have to kill everyone they know to do it.
The movie has pretty good performances by Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine. Don't listen to the other reviews on the internet,this is a pretty good movie. B for the movie,B for the acting. Enjoy!!!",1076112000,3,700,4.351145038167939

7856713,2,6303952798,"The Tie That Binds tells a story of a couple who are suffering and struggling after their adopted daughter is being reclaimed by her biological parents that happens to be a murderous couple and would go to any means necessary - legal or illegal - in doing so. It stars Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine as the violent couple,who are also tries to harass the policeman that took their daughter away from them and the social worker who took care of her at foster home. Meanwhile Vincent Spano and Moira Kelly star as the adoptive couple who are in danger. It was directed by Wesley Strick.

The producers tried to recapture the spirit of their successful movie The Hand That Rocks The Cradle in this particular film. Despite of its complexities and sophistication in the story,it does not manage to do so as it came out mediocre in its genre. Too bad that the conclusion did not serve well with many of the viewers including myself as it was simply too implausible particularly when the young daughter was called upon to do something weird at the conclusion for the safety of her adoptive parents. Added to that,there was no depth into the characters and the story lacks background on them particularly the murderous couple. Some would also feel that this is one the worst films ever made during the 90's.",1431388800,,1302,4.660869565217391
