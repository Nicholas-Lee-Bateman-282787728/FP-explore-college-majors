8473980,5,B005HYTM9O,"I am absolutely thrilled to finally own a copy of this childhood classic.

The front cover may be in German, But it can play in English Audio. Really chuffed to own it as it brings back so many wonderful memories when I used to watch it as a child.

Best to buy it as the complete series. Some of the series is a lot more expensive to buy separately.",1416960000,,350,4.057971014492754
