6509463,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"This is an AMAZING show.  I totally understand why it won a Tony Award.  Jay was on stage for almost 2 hours with energy to spare.  What a great show; it's not just jokes and  wooden people, there's a heartfelt story here.  I learned, I laughed and even shed a tear or two.  We are so lucky to be able to see it since we missed when it was live.  Watch this show - you will not be sorry.",1407542400,10,387,3.8227848101265822
6509464,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"I mean, sure, I was a fan of SOAP... at eight years old (when it went off the air in 1981). But it was not until 2006 that I became a true Jay Johnson fan -- when I saw this show live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I know that in popular culture today, the idea of ventriloquism tends to sound like the punchline to its own lame joke. But believe me, seeing this show will forever change your perspective on this vastly underappreciated art form. This was by turns one of the funniest (we were quoting it around my house for months on end) and literally one of the most moving performances I ever saw in my life. I am so pleased it's finally being released on DVD. I can only hope it manages to convey all the charm and brilliance of the live show.

6509467,5,B00LXDQ8R2,LOVED IT!!!!!! Better than Jeff Dunham! My husband and I enjoyed it enough that halfway through we started over and had our 12 and 10 yr old daughters come watch with us. If I recall maybe a few curse words  but nothing they wouldn't here on regular cable channels.  We will probably watch this one again!,1470009600,,305,4.428571428571429

6509469,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"I was a die-hard Soap fan. Didn't miss one show. Each character in their own right was hilarious. I was always impressed how Jay Johnson could make me believe Chuck & Bob were really Two different people.
 That being said, I assumed, as hundreds had before him, Mr. Johnson would just fade into obscurity, with the occasional cameo appearance.
 Then I watched TWO & ONLY.
 I'm a big crusty old biker that isn't moved by much, but this guy is the real deal.  Amazing talent aside, this guy is so down to earth and connected with his audience I felt like he was one of my friends. (short of the Tattoos and Harley). When he was done, not only did want more humor, I wanted to hear more stories.
 My wife and I wanted more. We started looking on line for more Jay Johnson, and found his blog. How this guy takes you in and wraps you up in whatever he's into at that time is amazing.
 Two days later, my wife wasn't done. She surprised me with two tickets to a live performance in Fresno in August.  We have scheduled an entire vacation in California, just so we can attend Jays show at a winery no less.
 If you're not familiar with Jay Johnson, I strongly urge you to buy his dvd and watch. You will be hooked.

 If this comment somehow gets to Mr. Johnson, I would like to personally thank him for showing me that personality, humility and and intelligence can still be hilarious. Something obviously overlooked by so many of todays ""mega stars"".
 See you in Fresno in August.",1469318400,,1475,4.366300366300366

Jay is a wonderful storyteller and in his one man show (ok, one man and many wooden friends) he teaches and shares - and as an audience, we learn and laugh.  We learned about ventriloquism and it's history in a way that we weren't lectured or made to feel like we needed to take notes - he made the history personal and brought it to life in his own voice ""thrown"" into the carved wooden inanimate objects. By the end of the show, you understand how it works, how it's done and yet, by magic and by the way Jay puts it all together, you still feel that the carved wood at the end of his arm is alive and can speak for himself.  I can't gush enough at how wonderful this was done.",1458086400,,757,4.129251700680272

6509492,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Jay Johnson is one of the best ventriloquist!  I loved him when he was on Soap.  I also had the opportunity to see him live once years ago and he was hilarious! This video is a little different than your typical ventriloquist video though.  Even though he has several of his characters throughout this video, he is also telling a story along the way with humor, but it is not a continuous stream of characters.  It is a short history of ventriloquism through out time.  He tells how he became interested in being one at a young age, then how he made it happen, and who his mentor was, and of course the show that made him well known.",1456704000,,633,4.285714285714286

Each entertainer has their own specialty and Jay appears to be more a storyteller than ventriloquist, but still entertaining. Has some serious sad moments mixed between quips of humor.

Jay Johnson is brilliant. In this show, he doesn't only entertain, but he also takes you through the history of ventriloquism, going all the way back to its roots! Each segment with a dummy is prefaced by a history lesson that is as fascinating as natural gift for the art. This may be the best ventriloquist show I have ever watched!",1451347200,2,501,4.340425531914893

He voices props other than puppets with great success. The show additionally provides a history lesson on the practice of ventriloquism. Johnson is superior to Jeff Dunham in every way.",1441497600,2,354,4.966101694915254
6509511,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Without a doubt, this is THE BEST live film I have ever seen. Bryan Simon's 8-Camera shoot at Thalian Hall beautifully capture's Jay Johnson's Tony-Award winning theatrical experience. I pit this against any filmed concert or theater production, and I bet you it comes out on top. There has never been a cinematic style that so aids in the storytelling, you feel like you're actually there. I'm only mentioning the film itself because the fact that the show captured hear won a Tony Award means the quality of entertainment speaks for itself. I had the chance to interview both Simon and Johnson on the eve of this film's release in December 2014.

6509524,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"This is a must see show for anyone who really loves ventriloquism.  Jay Johnson is one of those few ventriloquists who have feet in both ventriloquism's past, and its future, and his historical insight into his own talent and art are those of a well learned man who seeks to impart just a bit of the wonder he has experienced in his study of the art to a greater audience.  As such, he is part philosopher, part educator, and part artist, in equal measure.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a very moving piece, especially those parts that deal with Jay's personal relationship with one of the singular great ventriloquists and puppet designers of the 20th Century.  It is not in the least pedantic or dull as some reviewers seem to think it is.  This is one of those shows that I will personally watch more than once, and that cannot be said, at least for myself, for about 90% of what passes for cinematic art.",1430697600,3,918,4.473053892215569

Jeff Dunham is a huge favorite of mine, but the more I watched Jay perform, the more I  believe he has acquired a greater command of the art.  I, personally, not only  loved  the history and illustrations he furnished about ventriloquism,  but  delighted in his experiences and life story.  I think anyone who watches this man's video can't help but come away from it with more joy in their heart than before.  If they do not, I would then have to question the existence of one.",1430438400,3,656,4.577586206896552

Along the way we get to see Jay with a cast of characters that are all him, yet completely separate! I love this DVD and got a bunch to give for Christmas presents, even for friends who were not necessarily fans of ventriloquism.

6509541,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Art definitely matters! Some time has passed since I've read a review of JayJohnson:The Two and Only DVD , so here's my take:

Jay is not only an entertaining master storyteller, with his blending on the history of ventriloquism (dummies, or as he refers, ""wooden Americans"") to his personal journey in meeting Art Sieving, from Springfield , IL  and coming full circle in his career, after his run on the beloved and hilarious comedy, ""Soap"" we are transported on his journey through heart and soul.

Jay Johnson is brilliant in communicating his art of ventriloquism, as beening of ""more than ordinary significance!"" Complicated moments of genius between himself and his character Bob, including a tape over their mouth bit, exude his joy of the art, and mastery of skill.

Jay, along with Bryan W. Simon's gifted direction, has inspired me to write my own journey through Ventriloquism to present later 2015.

If you haven't seen this wonderfully entertaining performance yet, what are you waiting for?

All the best in life & art!

6509544,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Some have complained that this is the wrong video - it isn't. Just saw the whole thing, and it's just as good as the first time I saw the show, ten years ago. Only much more recent! If there were any streaming issues, they have been fixed.",1421280000,3,239,4.1063829787234045
6509545,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"I can confirm as well, that the right show plays now for Two and Only.

It's really a wonderful show, and so much more then a ventriloquism act.  It's a history lesson, the power imagination, as well as the love for your art.  It made my wife cry and me tear up at the end (you will know when).

And of course, it's a monkey joke too.",1421193600,3,334,3.9402985074626864
6509546,5,B00LXDQ8R2,Wonderful DVD!  Loved the information about the history of ventriloquy and then Jay's personal history.  He is very talented and quite the philosopher too!,1421193600,3,155,5.416666666666667
6509547,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Jay Johnson is one of the true masters of the art of ventriloquism. Yes, the art of ventriloquism. Just as not every painter is an artist, few ventriloquists attain a level of mastery that would qualify them as artists in the from. Jay Johnson certainly does--and then some.

This DVD faithfully captures the Tony-award winning show as it was on Broadway. In it we learn about Jay's show business career, discover some of the history of ventriloquism and learn the story of Jay and his mentor, Art Sieving. There are laughs aplenty and some very touching moments. You will surprise yourself with tears when Jay has to explain a difficult show business choice to his first puppet. And I challenge you to keep a dry eye when Jay describes his last meeting with his mentor's puppet.

Through all shine Jay's artistry, his superb technique, his humor and, most important, his humanity. You may remember him from the hit show ""Soap,"" but you will never forget him in ""Two and Only.""",1421020800,6,977,4.741176470588235
6509548,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"I've seen this show live several times and it never fails to blow me away.

6509549,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"I was finally able to watch this beautiful show. If you are a fan of ventriloquism and you have seen all the rest, when you watch this you realize that Jay is simply the best. His ease of voice and grace of character is flawless. It is very easy to see that ALL current ventriloquists owe Jay a debt of gratitude. He brought ventriloquism into its modern iteration and made the dummy no dummy.",1419984000,,393,4.324324324324325
6509550,5,B00LXDQ8R2,I saw the show in London and loved it. I have been watching it tonight on DVD and it is just as clever and funny as I remember. The aspect I had forgotten was how moving it is. Get the tissues ready!!,1419638400,5,200,3.7857142857142856

6509553,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Jay Johnson is the greatest living ventriloquist. I saw his Broadway show and just watched the film. He not only delivers an hilarious banter between himself and the infamous Bob, his partner from the TV series SOAP, but also takes us on his own personal journey into ventriloquism and his relationship to a mentor, which is both touching and funny. Jay introduces us to some other great characters, including a talking tennis ball. This film is a terrific way to see his Tony Award winning production.",1418169600,6,502,4.848837209302325
6509554,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"Went to this show when it was on Broadway and had a blast. What a great way to experience a Tony award winning Broadway show in your living room.  It's not just a comedy routine.  You will learn about the art of Ventriloquism, share Jay's personal story, laugh, cry and smile all the way though.  A not to be missed show, get this for everyone you know as a great Holiday Gift...just saying....;-)",1417910400,5,397,4.410958904109589
6509555,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"This is a phenominal performance.  Jay Johnson manages to give us comedy, art, and a lesson on the history of ventriloquism all at once.  What seperates this from other ventriloquism performances (aside frome Jay's incredible talent), is that it takes the act off of the stand up comedy stage and puts it in legitamate theater.  It brings more than laughs (although there are plenty to be found), it gives us something to ponder.  It's a show you'll want to talk about with friends afterwards.  It's a show that's highly entertaining and inspiring.  I highly reccomend it.",1407715200,8,572,4.90625

I loved him in Soap, but now I know why his dummy got the best lines! Maybe some day I will dare to watch it again and maybe re-evaluate it. Not right now, though!",1500681600,,337,4.184615384615385
8668765,5,B00LXDQ8R2,"This is one of the best works & performances Jay (one if the vest ventriloquists of all time)  has given to the world.

My only regret is that a few reviewers here have somehow confused a comedy-drama with reality.

It is a play, albeit based on of very personal experiences.

Jay is one of the most brilliant ventriloquiak comnedians, and one if the most humble guys there are.",1496620800,,378,4.514705882352941
