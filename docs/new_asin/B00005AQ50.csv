1415285,2,B00005AQ50,Lanuage barrier is difficult to master. Plot is way out and not the type of film I enjoy. Would not recommend it.,1122854400,2,113,4.181818181818182
1415286,3,B00005AQ50,"Beautifully shot film about S&M relationship between a man and woman (formerly husband and wife).

OK content. But who really finds enemas arousing?

one or two juicy parts. The best is what the main guy does when he comes upon a pair of deceased lovers (i wish it had more scenes like this one).

Didn't have as much mouth-watering perversity as I would have liked. And the faux-sex scenes are not too convincingly staged.",1100563200,11,423,4.6891891891891895
1415287,4,B00005AQ50,"I watched this movie as I was getting ready for work and to say the least, I was almost late for work.

The primary actors in the film are some sick puppies (smile).  Both the characters of the wife and the husband are in dire need of professional mental health.  I guess I could say the same for the director of the film and myself for watching it.  The bathroom scenes where outrageous.

In reality, not a film for those with weak stomachs.  The acting was outstanding but some of the subject matter......

Good to have in the DVD collection but not a film for anyone not used to Japanese pink films.

Note:  I am so glad that they did not show any (disgusting) scenes with the little (cute) Japanese girl.  If they had done that I would have disposed of the DVD.",1093910400,20,765,4.286713286713287
1415288,5,B00005AQ50,This is probably one of the best examples of classic Japanese erotica ever.  The aesthetics are amazing and the film is very well shot.  The DVD transfer is quite beautiful and clear.  The film is not for everyone and the story is certainly lurid.  A must for fans of this genre. Naomi Tani is simply amazing.,996019200,21,309,4.464285714285714
1415289,4,B00005AQ50,"'Wife' is one of the best examples of the Japanese Film Industry's notorious pink films made in 1974 by Nikkatsu Studios. Starring the Queen  of Japanese SM Naomi Tani, 'Wife' is the story of an abducted woman who  overpowers her abusive husband by succumbing to the pleasures of masochism.  The film articulates a social commentary through the depiction of graphic  SM scenes that fuction as a metaphor for gender relations in Japanese  society. The underlying theme of the movie is to suggest that there is an  impossibility of romantic love between japanese men and women and that  sadism and masochism are possibly alternative forms of love than  those of  social obligation or the reani kekkon (Love marriages). The film asks us  (well the japanese of 1974) to take a closer look at our realtionships to  each other and roles within society which may be in itself the bigger of SM  relationship than that of the personal one depicted in the pink film.  Overall its a gruelling film to watch but Pasolini's SALO was never  intended to be fun entertainment either.  The amazon video tape reviewed  here is a quality transfer from the original uncensored Japanese 35mm print  which retains the crystalline cinematography and minimal soundtrack. The  film is subtitled which is required for an artistic film with such a rare  tension between cruelty and beauty.",964656000,43,1362,4.973333333333334
7935560,4,B00005AQ50,"Wife goes from cliche, submissive Japanese wife to dominating submissive - meaning she demands to be tied and tortured. While some complain about the content, it is/was, IMHO, 40 years ahead of its time. If you follow current trends in Japanese BDSM, it's all here. This movie could have been made last Thursday, it is that relevent.

My issues are with plot and, I don't know how to say this, but it would have been a good intro to a real look at a twisted psychology. Meaning that her transformation could have happened in, say, fifteen minutes, then we'd be treated to a movie about a transformed woman exploring her new life. Also, there's no real indication as to the time frame. Did he keep her for a week? A month? When the change comes it comes awfully fast.

As for plot, there's a gratuitous rape scene where she ends up half naked and muddy. And hubby brings her to an abandoned house that seems overstocked with rope of all shapes and colors. There's no explanation as to how he saves the young suicide couple. And no logic as to how they manage their second attempt. I won't spoil it, but it's one of those 'huh?' moments.

Bottom line: An enjoyable Japanese BDSM romp with an attractive milf-like lead bound several times in those complex shibari things the Japanese love so much. There is plenty of nudity. And it has a real story line to boot. The story has holes like Swiss cheese, but, hey, it's a story.",1343606400,,1422,4.503875968992248
7935561,4,B00005AQ50,"The ex-husband disappeared three years ago. He returns, claiming just to be passing through. By a clever device, he ensnares then kidnaps his ex-wife. He takes her to an almost idyllic rural location. The film becomes a study of seduction and conquest, resistance and a struggle to retain personal integrity. He promises. She `lets him'. Promises are broken. She is tethered. Degradation enters the frame. Torture ensues. Violation by two strangers leads to her discovery, unconscious and dishevelled. His reactions are contradictory. A fishing trip offers unexpected bounty. It is a digression that offers him more pleasure and her, vicarious and eventually, actual enjoyment. The two discovered young lovers are humiliated. Hers is perverse; lavatorial, with the irony of triumphant music to highlight her relief - perversion indeed. This is a wife being degraded, not sacrificed. The conclusion surprises, on many fronts.",1314144000,,924,5.514084507042254
7935562,4,B00005AQ50,"Definitely not a movie for the mainstream, or the squeamish. Has a Japanese sensibility and storyline that makes it a little difficult for us Westerners to understand.

The themes and bondage are universal however, and were nicely done. Not a how to by any means, but plenty of sexy scenes and shots to make it worthwhile if you are into the bdsm scene.",1226793600,,353,4.603174603174603
7935563,4,B00005AQ50,"Oh Naomi, how many times must you be bound, tortured and forced before you realize how much you love it? Apparently many, many times.

Naomi Tani, taking her name from the classic Junichiro Tanizaki novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naomi/dp/0375724745/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naomi</a>, made her career in the Nikkatsu Studios notorious ""pink"" SM films. This woman has probably been tied up and beaten more than anyone else alive. If you have the stomach for this sort of thing, then ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" (""Ikenie fujin"") is one of the best of the genre.

Kunisada's wife, Akiko (Naomi Tani), left him three years ago due to his violent temper. Kunisada has bided his time, until he could reclaim what is his. Kidnapping her, he takes her to a hidden cabin where he subjects her to a variety of humiliations, slowly breaking her will until she realizes that true love lies in abject submission to her husband. Along the way, they take in another couple, a failed double-suicide, and try to share their new found wisdom.

The style of ""Wife to be Sacrificed,"" along with the performances of the actors, is what sets it apart from other films with similar plots. It is almost artistic in its pursuit of the boundaries of submission and love, taking itself very seriously. The eroticism is subdued, and is never explicit. While there is nudity, it is nothing even approaching ""hardcore.""

Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and there is more than enough here to offend, but if you like a bit of well-done SM, then ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" is for you.

This DVD release is better than previous versions, including the documentary ""Sadistic and Masochistic"", a retrospective of director Masaru Konuma, the king of the genre and of course the director of ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" as well as the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-and-Snake/dp/B000QGDXI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower and Snake</a>.

7935564,5,B00005AQ50,"Wife To Be Sacrificed is the best filmed Japanese BDSM erotica I have
ever seen.  It also hits several other taboo subjects quite hard.  It
is beautiful and disturbing.  There is no comedic relief.  The gorgeous
Naomi Tani is absolute perfection.  This film is not for everyone.  It
is dark and touches on some very uncomfortable subjects besides the main BDSM storyline. Having said that, there are very few quality films with
an actual storyline dealing with BDSM.  This is the best I have ever seen.
The quality of the look and feel, is that of a big budget film.  As with my review of Flower & Snake '74, this is worth having- even if just for Naomi Tani. The viewing quality of the Kino DVD is excellent.",1205712000,12,709,4.484375
7935565,3,B00005AQ50,"this was really a bizarre story yet made believable by skillful direction and performances. Wife was a new kind of film for me as i have not experienced many japanese films beyond say guinea pig and naked blood type shockers. this was a nice change. this sort of thing deffinately appeals to the darker side of voyeurism. i admittedly got a kick out of the sadistic shenannigans. not so sure if i would watch this again any time soon but it is well worth a look. kind of wish i hadnt purchased the initial us release for $20 since a new proper release has recently become available for a couple dollars more. i do recall the picture being rather dark and muddy and hopefully the new release corrects this. i would consider upgrading.
pretty odd little psycho sexual film. a better release would warrant 4 stars.",1204156800,,811,4.561643835616438
