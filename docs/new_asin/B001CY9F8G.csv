8290416,5,B001CY9F8G,"The show was interesting from looking at the DVD's. I didn't get the show where I live. I thought from all the reviews I had heard about it, it would be something that I would learn from and enjoy. I was not that impressed. It did have a lot of different things they talked about, so you have a choice to watch the whole thing or take a break and then come back and watch more. However it was worth what I paid for it.",1355184000,,418,3.929411764705882
