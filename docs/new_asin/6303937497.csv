732078,4,6303937497,"I liked this film. However, I can see why it might offend some devout Catholics.  So - if you are a devout Catholic, you have been warned.
It has a quiet way about it, as it leisurely goes through the story of this gentle priest, coming to a crossroads of his life. It is more character oriented - it's not an ""action"" film, or really even a ""mystery"" film (even though the murder mystery is what moves the plot along).
Supporting actors are great - and there is a wonderful jazz score by Charles Gross. Check out actor David Straithairn (sp?) in a small part (as the murder victim) in the beginning of the film. Other familiar faces will crop up as well, like Frances Fisher, (the mom in ""Titanic"").
This is a definite departure from the Tommy Lee Jones we have all become used to (in the '90s and beyond). If you are a big Jones fan (like I am) you might want to see this film.
I also wanted to point out: a previous reviewer was confused about many facets to this story.  The murder mystery *is* solved, there is nothing ambiguous about it.  (...)
Just enjoy the movie - all will be revealed.",1007856000,11,1095,4.305825242718447
732079,3,6303937497,"I am a fanatical TLJ fan so I bought the DVD. I found the story to be broken and the acting to be forced. TLJ is holding himself back trying not to be a stronger character. There are many loose ends, is the murderer caught? Do the lovers get together? What does the accused murderers homosexuality have to do with the story, and does he get off? I think the stories subject matter is very strong but needed to be more focused on temptation and guilt of a wayward priest and less on solving a seemingly simple murder
which the cop couldn't figure out, but only took the priest and ex-girlfriend 2 scenes to solve. Good to watch if your a TLJ fan but not a very good story overall.",1002672000,2,679,4.230769230769231

732226,4,6303937497,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot because of the ratings, but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it kept me in my seat. I love Wes Bentley. He's fantastic, everything he does. He was appropriately creepy, but could have gone just a little more psycho. Cam Gigandet is loveable and the kind of guy you'd want to marry: understanding and forgiving. It felt like maybe too much had been edited out and it needed a bit more meat, but I'd watch it again.",1494633600,2,467,4.5058823529411764
732227,1,6303937497,"Tara is getting married, but after her bachelorette party she has a crush on an intriguing bartender. Obviously she goes to bed with a stranger who turns out to be,  guess what? A dangerous psychopath who begins stalking her. From there is  a poor rehash of a Fatal Attraction plot, with many absurdities into the bargain, nobody calling the cops, Tara telling nothing to her husband, and the final absurdity of a beach resort without any night personnel and, it seems, no guests besides the nwlyweds. The ending is predictable, and the final twist  sends you groaning but grateful this bomb is over",1494547200,,599,4.796116504854369

So being really stupid and mesmerized by him,  she ends up in bed with him, wakes up all nervous and upset, wants to leave, but he blocks her way out the door of his dwelling, until she gets firm. Then she gets home to continue wedding plans, though she's a nervous wreck. From then on, it's so predictable, boring and poorly acted. The ending? I almost laughed.

He still did a great job in this movie but again ....the editing and directing destroyed the movie. The movie trailer makes the movie seem good,  don't believe it.

732608,5,6303937497,"This is a wonderful story about being true to one's self and one's vows when the institutional framework does not necessarilly support this direct truthfulness.  This is the story is of a priest who discovered his true commitment to religious beliefs versus just what the ""institution"" of the church teaches.  This story illustrates the power one has when one sorts out his/her beliefs in relation to what our instituions teach. Some may not agree because he did not remain faithful to the teachings of his church but he became more aware of his beliefs and where his true loyalties should be placed. He could accept, ""It is between HIM and me and no one else."" He discovered that true faith and commitment is more than just what our institutions teach.  It was not an easy personal decision. It came after deep personal struggle. Tommy Lee Jones gave a wonderful performance as the priest in this film.",1335139200,2,903,4.7756410256410255

732611,3,6303937497,"This was sort of your typical story of a priest who falls in love and doubts his beliefs and needs time to understand how he really feels.  It is set apart by the marvelous acting of Tommy Lee Jones who so very well conveys his feelings of confusion and guilt after being intimate with a woman he loves.  Although, David Strathairn, appears very briefly he is excellent, as usual, and draws you in to wanting to know more about this character, his life, his inner most feelings, and his strength, which is apparent by the dignity he portrays in dying. I thought the screenplay was very good, and wish it were a book, so I could really feel everyone's emotions.  This was really a magnificent piece of acting by Jones, who was so readable, by putting his feelings right out there.  It was too bad, there were no flashbacks with David Strathairn, as his too brief appearance was saddening.  He, I think, is too overlooked in his craft.  His ability to make himself believable, in any part he takes on is truly amazing.  In 'Broken Vows', he draws you in as he is the first actor to really appear, and the camera, doesn't leave his face and his mesmerizing eyes.  it draws you in, and he dies, almost immediately.  Annette O'Toole is adequate as the love interest, but I would have expected a deeper love interest for Jones.  I don't want to give away the ending, which is the only plausable finale.  I highly recommend it, not for the storyline but the truly good and convincing acting.  It sets the movie apart from others with the same theme.",1235779200,7,1542,4.5071942446043165
732612,4,6303937497,"This made-for-TV movie had an intriguing premise: Tommy Lee Jones as Father Joseph, a Catholic priest who by chance gives last rites to a dying man, the victim of a stabbing.  Taken aback by the man's complete peace with himself and no anger toward his murderer, Jones embarks on a journey to find out more about the man and his religion-less ""faith"" to answer his own doubts about his efficacy as a priest; along the way he meets the dead man's ex-love, played by Annette O'Toole.  Yes, this movie is somewhat formulaic - a murder mystery and a love story with enough forbidden fruit to go around, but it's a fun watch because Jones brings life to his roles no matter the terrain; the problem is his love interest - O'Toole seems forced as a perky artist and an independent modern woman; the chemistry could have been better with an actress more natural and less contrived in her motivations. All in all, if you're a Tommy Lee Jones fan, this is a great summer beach novel as TV fare.",1195948800,4,985,4.4972067039106145
