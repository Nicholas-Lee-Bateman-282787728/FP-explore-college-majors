8448341,5,B004YI0GZI,"This episode of Frontline - produced by WGBH- Boston - aired on May 11, 2011. The DVD release comes just shortly before the trial of former army Private Bradley Manning, who was at the center of the WikiLeaks controversy when this disturbed soldier was allowed (through lax security) to download a quarter of a million secret classified documents and war logs in Iraq and Afghinistran. Co-producer, writer, and correspondent Martin Smith presents a a well-balanced and well researched story in the 55 minute episode. The important people - including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange - are interviewed. Certain scenes are recreated (which, personally, I find annoying, but is becoming commonplace on PBS these days).

The story is an important one and is timely. As Frontline often does so well, the subject is covered so that someone who is just hearing about it will learn the basic story quickly. And there are onscreen popups telling you to go to pbs.org for more details.

There is a scene selection option but no added bonus features.
