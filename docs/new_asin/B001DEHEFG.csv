8293025,4,B001DEHEFG,"Despite the cover being a photo taken from around 2003, the concert on this disc was recorded in 1993 or 1994 (94 I'm guessing) on Rod's Unplugged...and seated tour. There was a bootleg VHS of this show making the rounds a decade ago, and this non-official release of the DVD adds nothing to that VHS. It's obvious some small company got hold of this and is trying to cash in. One odd thing about it is, there is no menu on the DVD. You hit menu and it just starts over. However, surprise of surprises--the audio on this disc is pretty good. About an 8 out of 10, I would say. The picture is decent too, slightly better than the VHS version I used to own. The best part of the concert is when Rod goes into the crowd and causes pandemonium. Also--great solos by guitarist Jeff Golub and Saxophone player Jimmy Roberts. Considering there aren't a lot of Rod videos available this one is a keeper. And you can usually find it on ebay for under $15. Running time is around 90 minutes.",1232841600,,981,4.336956521739131
8293026,5,B001DEHEFG,"Sarah Connor sings wonderfully in this DVD.

The quality of the sound and footage are impressive.

She performs all the songs live and her emotion is transfered to the audience as well as to the DVD watchers.

Very Nice!!!

It is highly recommended.

Amazon.com also brought this DVD very fast...
