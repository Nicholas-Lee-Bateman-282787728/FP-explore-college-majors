I have been on safari myself in Kenya and Tanzania so I was pleased to see how realistic the cinematographers and producers kept things.  My only real problem with the dvd's is that in far too many of the episodes, one can see the narrator and his crew drinking alcoholic beverages either at the end of the day or at the lodges.  This is unfortunate for not only does it take away from the purpose of the wildlife footage, but as a teacher, it prevents me from using the dvd's in my classroom.  Sure, I could turn the dvd on and off as these scenes occur, but this becomes a nuisance.  I don't know why they felt the need to show people drinking beer and wine all the time.",1265414400,3,748,4.314285714285714

Glad I did, the footage is amazing and very watchable, the narrator is soothing and informed. A few of the episodes do obviously have sponsorship, but I looked at that part as ""if I ever go I know where to stay"". This was a very enjoyable 5+ hrs worth of visual documentary.",1153872000,9,364,4.140845070422535
