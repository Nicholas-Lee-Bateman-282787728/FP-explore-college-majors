EDIT: It now works as it should. Great series!!",1349049600,5,255,4.3125
5022516,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Watched the first episode of this series.  The acting is superb and the story both compelling and heartwarming.  Really brought home how only a little over 60 years ago, life in London (and the poor areas of many large cities) was a far cry from now.  Yet conditions like this series shows, and even worse, are still prevalent in many parts of our world.",1349049600,7,354,4.5
5022517,5,B006W8CJ1W,"This miniseries from the venerable BBC is an absolute must see. Following young midwives working with nuns in the East End of London in the 1950s, it will have you laughing and crying all at once. Based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, it has characters that will enter your heart and have you thinking of them for days.

The first episode was wonderful and the second even better. The talents of Jenny Agutter, the hilarious Miranda Hart, Pam Ferris and the newcomer with the face of an angel Jessica Raine are utilized to the utmost. It is quite unbelievable at times how far we have come in 55 years when you see the poverty, and yet it never seems to be a downer.

I can absolutely recommend purchasing the DVDs as this is one series you will watch again and again. The Beeb has commissioned a second season including a Christmas special (I love the Brits for this!) so hang onto your hats for more amazing stories next year!",1348790400,195,930,4.464705882352941

Appealing nurses & intriguing nuns balance the gritty endurance of post-war & caste-restricted Britain transitioning from rural to industrial revolution urbanity pros & cons.

Go find an educational documentary or an action-packed thriller; at least then you can walk away feeling informed or satisfied. This show doesn't approach either of those states. (P.S.

5022602,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Call the Midwife is not only a blockbuster hit for BBC and PBS but represents a new high for a television series that, though produced on a budget, approaches the power of theatrical releases costing 200 times as much.  I've always been a sucker for so-called ""women's movies,"" or ""weepers.""  The original ""Stella Dallas,"" in which Barbara Stanwyck sacrifices her own life for her daughter's chance at a better life; or ""To Each His Own,"" with Olivia DeHavilland giving birth to a child without the father's knowledge and choosing to bear the shame as much for his sake as hers; or, more recently, ""The English Patient,"" with the ""toasted"" living remains of Ralph Fiennes narrating a story about his fulfillment of a promise to his soul-mate, Katharine (Kristen Thomas), to rejoin her at any cost for consummation of their love (a modern version of Heathcliff's ""romantic exhumation"" of Kathy's grave in Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s ""Wuthering Heights"").

These films are examples of a form that has fallen out of favor, variously referred to as weepers, or womens films, or simply as melodrama.  Men avoid them as much as women are attracted to them.  And academics armed with feminist theory routinely deconstruct such films to expose the always exploitive and oppressive patriarchal order that produces and promotes such films for their own power and profit. [Later:  Although the show could not be more ""life-affiirming,"" the author will no doubt raise the hackles of modern-day ""evangelicals"" when she relates her experiences working with pregnant women forced to reproduce like cows and risk their lives living in a single-room flat with a family of ten. It becomes all too clear that neither legitimate abortion clinics nor the pill could come too soon for the over-stressed women in London's East End.]  But with well-written scripts and good actors these are stories that rise to the level of grand operaa form of melodrama, or lyrical-plus-dramatic elements that engage the listener and excite the senses beyond the reach of any dommon crime story or sitcom. In short, this show has been for this jaded viewer the most riveting and compelling drama since the first four seasons of ""Mad Men"" or the most memorable, envelope-pushing episodes of ""House.""

The Midwifeno doubt owes some of its success to the actual experiences of the young woman whose story it tells (with the help of Vanessa Redgrave's narration). But it's anything but a documentary. Credit the scriptwriters for a singleminded focus on a diverse group of brave, caring nurses united by their determination to save the lives (mother and child) of the needful women they come upon.  Each of the nurses is an unforgettable character, and the circumstances of each mother is uniquealways fascinating, usually surprising, sometimes shocking.  But it's this focus that also allows the writers to introduce, in every episode, a subplot--or two or three. No previous show that has used cross-cutting among different stories--a device that can easily produce confusion and even boredom--has done so as seamlessly and effectively as ""Call the Midwife"" (at least not in this viewer's memory).  And each episode packs a dramatic wallop that's usually enough to make this writer and jaded male consumer of texts (literature, film, music) speechless for a good half hour afterwards.

All of the characters during the first season are believable and sharply individualized (how do the British manage to cast, again and again, actors whose characters step off the pages to touch our own lives with such remarkable consistency?).  Outside of Jenny Agutter, whom I remember from Walkabout (1972), there are few names that I recognize, though Amanda Hart and several others are likely to become household words based on their performances in the show. But the solid center of the production is Jessica Raine, totally believable as the character who wrote the autobiographical source and who is the protagonist of what is essentially a woman's rite of passage at a time (the 1950s) routinely mischaracterized by present-day American and British viewers. Her challenge is to convince us that she must resist the advances of a charismatic suitor because of a commitment to another lover who exists as a mere ghost from the distant past.  She does so, stringing us along with the same steadfastness as her persistent, resolute suitor.

""Call the Midwife"" takes on a seemingly impossible challenge: 1. it's at once a ""coming of age"" story of a brilliant young woman (and at a time--the 1950s--that is still fresh in the minds of many of us): 2. it's a fascinating dramatization of the institutional, scientific and natural elements pertaining to human childbirth;  3. it's, above all, a powerful and dynamic, universal yet personal, ""love story.""  Each episode testifies to the presence of love by showing us the evidence--love's labor won! (not lost).  And with each new birth, I suspect I'm not alone in feeling--welling up from deep inside of me--a victory cry on behalf of a pretty great human race. (The triumph is even more conclusive when the result is twins--an occasion for doubling up on the salutations.  And when one of the episodes produces not just one bairn-- or a mere pair--but triplets!--that's a call for a three-part celebration--one for a rare birth of Trinity-like proportions; another just for the privilege of being born--even as a loner; and the third a special shout-out to this series, especially if you agree that it's one of the best love stories to hit the home screen.",1474761600,,5549,5.098125689084895

They are based on the memoirs of Jennifer worth, a midwife in the East End of London in the 1950's. I have also read the books and the adaptations are very true to the real stories. Even if you don't have an interest in nursing or midwifery you would still enjoy this, my boyfriend has watched it all. All the characters are incredible.

Well Joanne Whalley-Kilmer was pretty enough she's no Vivien Leigh know what I mean? It didn't make it not a good mini series..it was and I love it...it's just not the same...the same with this series it's still good but you take away to of the major character's and it's still good but just different that's all I'm saying,1462665600,,750,4.364285714285714

First of all, I'm a bit of a history buff, and I love anything vintage, so this is right up my alley. this wonderful show chronicles a group of young midwives in 1950s England. I have learned a lot about london's east end and how things used to be in areas of poverty, or lower middle class areas. Based on the books written by Jennifer Worth herself, this wonderful series paints a vibrant picture of the wonderful care these women gave in the post war years. i watched this show religiously when i was expecting my little girl..i was craving anything baby related, lol.

5022705,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I love the show's earlier seasons which include the character Jenny Worth, upon whose memoir the show is based. Take her away (season. 4) and all you have is a painstakingly politically correct story detached from its source. Great acting all around, and such a joy with the different characters interacting, the personalities and the history involved. The various workhouse survivors are haunting. Like with many shows on television, the first season is the best and brightest, though the second season doesn't disappoint. It is unflinching in its depiction of humanity.

I have one question, maybe someone can answer this: in Season 1 episode 3 (my favorite), I see that the montage scene that was famously accompanied by ""Magic Moments"" by Perry Como has now in Amazon streaming been given a different song instead. Why? WHY? Why would they do that?",1458000000,,852,5.042553191489362

5022707,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I absolutely love 'Call the Midwife.'  My Mum was born at the start of WWII in London, and grew up in the 50s, and this series brought to life her stories for me, especially the 'having babies at home' part.  Both my oldest brother and sister were born in front of the coal fireplace in the sitting room of my Nan's house, with a Midwife in attendance.  Sadly, my Mum passed away recently, so watching this wonderful series brings back those wonderful times of her storytelling, which is why I give the series 5 stars.  Now Amazon streaming video, I'm only giving 1 star because, they have cut quite a few parts out of each episode.  In Series 1, Episode 6, I especially noticed it with the parts of Chummy and Peter's story, which is such a sweet one.  Why would you do that Amazon?  I will have to stop buying streaming video services from you.  So now I will save my hard earned pennies and buy the Series on DVD instead.",1457049600,8,924,4.3313953488372094
5022708,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I'm loving this series! Of course, I wind up crying at some point during every episode, but that's because the stories are about real life. And, real life is not always sunshine and roses. I just started the third season, and I'm still loving every minute.

I didn't purchase these Dvd's, but that's because the show is available for streaming on Netflix. However, I loved the first season so much, I DID purchase the book.

5022717,5,B006W8CJ1W,"""Call the Midwife"" is right up there with Downton Abbey only this one is for ladies only.
The shows will make you laugh and cry. A bit bloody, gritty and down to earth yet often you will find it touching and downright funny.

5022723,5,B006W8CJ1W,"The first episode was a little slow to grab me but as the characters and show developed, by the second episode I was totally hooked. This dramatic period series is based upon the memoirs of a British midwife. It begins in the mid 1950s in the poverty stricken East End of London. It is there that our young nurse begins her career as a midwife.

The series tell the viewer of her life and those with whom she works and lives. The acting is first rate, as are the scripts. The production values are excellent,  and the authenticity of the period is maintained throughout.  Vanessa Redgrave does a voiceover at the beginning and end of each episode, which provides a meaningful introduction and closure. Music appropriate to the era is beautifully integrated into each episode. Moreover, I love the show's  instrumental theme tune.  If the first season is a prognostication of things to come, I can hardly wait to see season two!",1453334400,,927,4.697530864197531

5022748,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I have all the cd's of this series and find them addictive.  All the issues that the medical care system has to face; all the various situations with various coping abilities are incorporated into the stories.  At first I thought watching an hour a day of women giving birth would be over the top.  But this is a peek into the 1950's when the luxury of birth control, health care and information are nowhere what they are today.  Personalities are developed and bonds of friendship formed.  As a retired nurse I can tell you that the birth of a WANTED baby is the most precious gift.  But the birth of a baby to an ill-equipped family can be the worst news and a real tragedy for all concerned.  The birth of a healthy baby is a miracle and the most joyous event to witness; the birth of a baby with medical problems is always a shock and can be crushing in every way.  This series seems to cover these situations and show the world as it is, with all it's imperfections; sometimes with good resolve to overcome but sometimes, in real life, that resolve doesn't exist.  Having grown up in the fifties, this is both a memory jogger to me as well as a nostalgic trip back in time.  Many times sitting with my grown daughter watching this series I had to tell her, ""...But this is the way it was in the fifties.  We accepted it""  I especially am entertained by the music chosen from the fifties to highlight, very fittingly, the various scenes.  Great fun!  The characters are well cast and well-acted.  I expect no less from BBC.  By the way----all babies are born blue.  It takes a minute or so to gain a good healthy pink with the intake of air.  Just saying'.",1445472000,,1660,4.369281045751634

My only concern with it is that they sometimes address things somewhat unrealistically (LBGQT rights, mental illness, biracial children). The storylines often have a modern perspective when they address these issues rather than showing more realistic behavior and attitudes of the time.

Until I saw the scene where a baby came out all blue, and she did nothing. Oh wait. yes she did...she put it in a bowl right in front of it's parents and then left it on the dresser.

Clearly according to the author's own recollection in the book , the GP was legitimately caring for other very ill people. The TV show made it sound like he just didn't bother to show up .

However, I find myself drawn emotionally into every show of this series, and I find myself crying from all three of these emotions.  This show is about real life in the poorest part of London, after WWII.  There are many simulated live births on these series that are so realistic, they even cut the umbilical cords.  This series also teaches that even poor people have dignity, pride, fun, and value life probably more than rich people.

This ""Call the Midwife"" series is based in the 50s and is about volunteer midwives working with nuns in the poorest part of London helping women give birth. This was prior to the invention of the Pill and these women had no access to pain killers etc. during child birth. During the first episode I cringed a lot while watching, but then I got used to it and started enjoying the different characters and the stories of everyone involved. I also loved the hairstyles and clothes portrayed in the series. All in all an enjoyable series and I'm looking forward to watching season 2.",1423872000,,696,4.713114754098361

Thought I would enjoy this more than I actually do ... For one thing, it's too graphic for my taste (especially if I'm watching an episode during my supper time - not recommended!) ... I liked watching these on public TV when I happened to come across them and now wish that I have kept it that way instead of just getting all three seasons on DVD, but that, I guess, has it's ""plus"" side, too ... Should the mood strike that I feel like watching an episode, then there they are in three collectives to view at my disposal ... So there ya go then ...

5022988,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I approached ""Call the Midwife"" with extreme caution and (like the good skeptic that I am), not knowing what I would find in a show about nuns and nurses in the 1950s... would it be cheesy and sappy?  By the end of the first episode my eyes were wet with tears and my heart was full of admiration and, dare I say, LOVE for these phenomenal women!!
Set in the late 1950s in one of the poorest parts of the east end of London, the religious Sisters of St. Raymond Nonnatus and some highly capable nurses deliver babies, care for the poorest of the poor, and live through some very hard times.  Despite this being essentially an ensemble show, the focus is largely on Nurse Jenny Lee (the beautiful Jessica Raine) as a newcomer to the poverty of the East End and the surprisingly unpredictable work of midwifery.  Plots in this first series are amazingly original despite roughly the same thing happening in every episode (I may be wrong, but the babies being born at that time could very well be that Baby Boomer generation now entering their 50s and 60s).  There are very human stories happening around these nuns and nurses that they are privy to, and much of the joy of this show comes from watching them each deal with their respective patient/sympathy case of each episode and learn a bit more about generosity of spirit, care towards fellow human beings, and the great power of love.  The sensibilities and conditions of Britain in the 1950s have also been captured so faithfully, one is totally immersed!
I can't say enough about the women of this program... every one of them touches a chord of emotion in me.  They are all beautiful in their own unique ways, even the seasoned nuns have a glow about them that is hard to describe.  Besides sensible, kind-hearted Jenny there is the waspish but absolutely gorgeous Trixie (Helen George), sweet, sympathetic Cynthia (Bryonne Hannah), and then there's my personal favorite the extraordinary Chummy (comedian Miranda Hart), a tower of aristocratic plumminess and good cheer with a heart of gold.  The nuns are unique and endearing all on their own, from the other-worldly Sister Monica Joan (who isn't always as flighty as she looks!), the tough as old boots but somehow lovable Sister Evangelina, and the saintly, mother-hen Sister Julienne.
""Call the Midwife"" hearkens back to a time when people looked after one another no matter what the circumstances... and for us in the present day that we are always capable of generosity towards our fellow man... that hope, good-will, and faith can change lives, and that if you want a piece of cake, be very crafty when hiding it from Sister Monica Joan!!",1407283200,3,2652,4.75
5022989,4,B006W8CJ1W,"This is another great Masterpiece series. Young women in the employ of s Catholic service provide midwifery in thebvEast end of London in the years just after WWII.

I should add that I've also never had much interest in either nurses or babys.  Nevertheless, I've been blown away by every aspect of this series.  I've recommended it to all of my friends and find myself describing it to others as a ""course in love"" of great value.  I would add here that the human qualities portrayed in this series are something like a perfect antidote for all that's wrong with society today.  Watch and learn.

The characters are so well developed and loveable that you are drawn in immediately. Somewhat a sad dreary tale of the 50's but realistic.

I love everything about it:  it's very well done, very well acted, love the characters, love the, I guess you could say, innocence, and I'm a sucker for the 50s music they play.

When I watch it I have to be sure my child is out of the room and cannot hear the screaming and hollering going on during the show.  He is very curious and wants details about what is going on.

5023056,2,B006W8CJ1W,"The scenes are very graphic, which didn't bother me so much as I've given birth five times, thank G-d; however, this is definitely not a show for children or young teenagers.  What did bother me was the extreme squalor portrayed--it was almost gratuitous.  The subliminal message of the episode was, ""If you have a lot of children, these are the conditions you'll find yourself in.""  A selfish and liberal agenda disguised as a TV show...!

I will not be watching further episodes of this series.",1399161600,2,496,4.8

5023059,5,B006W8CJ1W,I had no idea there were books; I loved the tv series. The books are fabulous - I read one after the other. There's a lot of info re childbirth that I'm glad I didn't know during my child bearing years! The characters are wonderful - particularly Sr. Monica Joan - an endearing loony. The different stories are engaging and absorbing. The books help the reader to better understand the series.,1398729600,,393,4.549295774647887

5023062,5,B006W8CJ1W,"When I first started watching this show I could not believe how heartful, realistic, and spiritual it is. It is nitty gritty and not easy to watch, as some of the story lines really pull on the heart strings. It is high quality story telling. It will make you laugh, cringe and cry! Enjoy this magnificent show and please tell everyone to give it a viewing.",1398038400,2,357,4.424242424242424

5023066,5,B006W8CJ1W,These are stories which carry some real value and leave you uplifted. It is a refreshing break in the week and makes you appreciate life as it is today which is part of the reason for the making of the series. It is good to see a somewhat unbiased view of religious life which is rare on the BBC today. Extremely enjoyable.,1397520000,,323,4.225806451612903

5023072,5,B006W8CJ1W,"This series came into my life at just the right time--during LENT--a season for Christians to reflect on unconditional love as shown by Jesus. These midwives give unconditional love in every situation they are thrust into. They are totally self-giving and non-judgemental, as Jesus would be. Yet they are fun-loving and totally love life. Every episode is not only very entertaining and full of surprises--but also uplifting and full of lessons to be reflected upon. You can really grow in wisdom from watching these episodes and reflecting on how the midwives give unconditional love in every circumstance of their lives.
I am enjoying every episode and eagerly look forward to the continuing story in Season 3!",1396828800,13,712,5.146551724137931

5023077,5,B006W8CJ1W,I absolutely love Season 1 of Call the Midwife.  Characters are well developed according to the time period.  It's important for us to see the unfortunate individuals who suffered so much with very little or no opportunity to extricate themselves from the establishment of the time.

5023081,5,B006W8CJ1W,a wonderful DVD based on memories by a midwife in the early years.

It's one story after another of human beings not judging but reaching out to each other in love, kindness and true caring for each other. Miranda Hart is a stitch and keeps you smiling as well. I've seen all the seasons and would recommend them to anyone.",1394409600,,370,4.3768115942028984

That is not to say that is all the show is about, though. Experience post- World War II London through the eyes of the young nurses as they go about their daily lives in the clinic, on their rounds, and at Nonnatus House. My one complaint would be that the seasons are entirely too short. (And the Christmas episode isn't included.) I have recommended them to several people who have all agreed with me on how fascinating the series is.",1394323200,,571,4.5

5023098,5,B006W8CJ1W,This is one of my favorite series of English shows.  It is so entertaining watching the nuns and nurses go out into the poor communities to help poor families with their babies.  So many separate human stories are told before your eyes.,1393545600,,236,4.595238095238095
5023099,5,B006W8CJ1W,The authenticity of this program is amazing and gives such a believable portrayal of a group of philanthropic women who don't get much press in historical accounts.  Love the acting - the pro-life message and the way the Catholic Nuns are given credit for all the good things that they have accomplished in taking care of those who are marginalized by society.  All life is valued and important is a great message in our PC world.,1393545600,,430,4.644736842105263

Wasn't sure about the series after the first episode but so glad I continued to watch the next episodes. The characters are a cross section of life and their reactions to events are honest.  A heart-warming series which delivers an impact.

It is something women do, so it is not that important? or they can not identify with it. Now if the baby came out with the sound of an engine roar, maybe that would get their attention. lol

The actual births are a bit more graphic than I was initially prepared for, but you get used to that and what really comes through the tolerance of the nuns and midwives as well as the grace of the people, both men and women for whatever life deals them.

5023132,5,B006W8CJ1W,"The National Health Service is Britain's welfare crown jewel and although much abused and victim of government meddling today, the very beginnings in the late 1940s were revolutionary.  For the first time the poor and those in poverty had access to free medicine and one key area was care of pregnant women and new born babies.  This tv series is superb in capturing the period and the relief brought to the poor of London's east end docklands when, for the first time in the UK, doctors, nurses, hospitals, and midwives provided health advice and medicine without asking for money first.",1389052800,,588,4.87

5023148,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Somehow the United States creative minds have lost the ability to create intelligent and heartwarming entertainment. Thankfully, the BBC continues to offer programming that is intelligent, well-written and balanced and the television show Call the Midwife proves this out. Call the Midwife is based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth the television shows how the midwives and medically trained sisters deal with deliveries and poverty. Balancing the drama is the character Chummy, who comes from a noble background, and ends up working with the impoverished. Chummy is a rather tall, and somewhat bumbley character, who seems to be what my mother would call a bull in a china shop. In other words, Chummy tries very hard to fit in, but due to her great height and size, spends time bumping into things with mood lightening results. Watching Chummy learn to ride a bicycle was very funny too. Her heart is gold and she eventually learns to fit in with the nurses and sisters at the Nonnatus House leading to much less bumping around.

I also enjoyed the music, especially listening to one of my favorite jazz artists named Blossom Dearie, who has a soft, little girl voice that knows how to sing. You will hear other jazz tunes and a dip into the 1950s jazzy dance music that calls for you to jump up and Jitterbug.

If you enjoy watching intelligent, well-written television I am sure you will love watching Call the Midwife.

Note:  I would not recommend watching this show when children are around. You will see women giving birth.

Highly recommend.

5023160,5,B006W8CJ1W,"....How Truly Great This Series Is!

With almost 700 reviews for this series, and with those reviews averaging close to the five-star maximum, it's obvious that this series has struck a chord with people. I have to admit I was late in tuning in....my tastes run more toward the Brit crime or comedy genres. If I could find a comparison, I'd mention All Creatures Great and Small. Both shows are set in the past, based upon real life, with it's good times, bad times, sad times, and glad times. I am very sorry that I took so long to tune in. This superb program has more to offer than 99% of the TV shows and movies out there. I'm a Downton Abbey fan, and an eager and enthusiastic devotee of just about any TV or film production having anything to do with England. I would say without equivocation that Call the Midwife is one of the finest programs I've ever seen. It's worthy of SIX stars.

Yes, the acting is exceptional, the stories and characters endlessly fascinating, the writing and dialogue completely believable, but in addition to all that, the creators of the show have paid special attention to the LOOK of the sets and the characters. Great care has obviously gone into each and every shot. There is an epidemic in today's movies and TV which is characterized by the shaking camera, short, frenetic cuts and gigantic closeups of faces. These lazy, cliched and careless techniques are designed to hide the fact that minimal  attention has been paid to composition and lighting and set construction. It is almost as if the filmmakers had no clue on one of the ABC's of film: how to compose, frame, and light a shot. Downton has been praised for its attention to detail, colors and lighting, and the same could be said of Call the Midwife. Even though we see a gray, greasy and grimy version of London and its environs, we glimpse moments of beauty, subtle but rich color, deep focus activity behind the main characters in a scene...in other words, a huge amount of artful planning and loving care has gone into the creation of the show.

In the first episode, I found myself howling with laughter....and weeping with sadness, within ten minutes of each other. The series is based upon the memoirs of an actual English midwife who worked in London's East End in the 1950's. The East End was, and in many cases, still is, a gritty, rough-and-tumble working class area, rife with poverty and degradation....the opposite of 'posh'. As they say, life here can be nasty, brutish and short. No punches appeared to be pulled. In fact, when Jessica Raine, playing Jenny Lee, the new young midwife, first enters the neighborhood, she walks right into a snarling cat fight between two women--one of them pregnant!--scrapping over a man. Not all the births are happy and blessed and joyful. My wife spent many years as an obstetrical nurse and she tells me that the birthing scenes are quite realistic. My mother smoked while she was pregnant with me, probably drank as well, but that was due to ignorance, and, in the series, most of the pregnant women depicted are not in a position to be overly concerned about the health of their unborn children. No, most of them are more preoccupied with finding their next meal, or with taking care of the kids they already have.

Pam Ferris as Sister Evangelista (from Rosemary and Thyme) is great and hugely funny as she hurls delightfully caustic lines toward her fumbling and bumbling underlings. Jenny Agutter is the image of the happy, positive and patient nun who sees the bright side of everything and everyone. Miranda Hart is sweet and kind and funny and poignant as an upper class girl who happens to be much larger physically than most of the men she would be interested in. Her Chummy Browne has a heart as big as her ungainly frame.

You will grow to love these characters and this series, and you will learn a lot from them as well.",1383782400,5,3888,4.6438953488372094

5023172,5,B006W8CJ1W,"These shows were, on the whole, true to the books. They reflect life in the poorer sections of London before birth control.  They provide a glimpse at the lives of the women, as they struggled with their husband's chronic joblessness, refuge in alcohol, and lack of self confidence.  They also portray the lives of the nurses and nuns who care for those that life has cast aside.  Yet the grinding poverty and the thankless hours of nursing seem somehow upbeat and hopeful.  Acting is superb and it is narrated by Vanessa Redgrave - one of the truly great actresses of our time.",1382400000,,578,4.637254901960785

5023179,4,B006W8CJ1W,"This is an interesting show with GREAT character's. I really LOVE it except for one thing. I am seeing too many baby heads popping out of their mothers. I know it's in the title BUT can't we have more story less ""live"" births. It gets old quick. The obligatory ""birth scene"" we know what's going on. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of other drama happening BUT I hate the obligatory anything... it gets, well, boring... you know... here comes the birth scene. Not always necessary to see the whole thing and certainly not in every episode. I do love the characters, the time period and the actors are VERY good. The production is outstanding. It's a really good watch... except for the ... you know.",1379808000,,702,4.535433070866142

5023182,5,B006W8CJ1W,"One of my favorite series out of PBS.  I admit I'm a sucker for shows out of the UK, Doc Martin, Downton Abby, etc., but, in addition to being a great show, it takes me back to my own American childhood with the music, clothes and news headlines of the 50s.  I wouldn't miss it if I were you.",1379462400,,292,3.9322033898305087

5023184,5,B006W8CJ1W,"When a friend told me, ""I think you will LOVE this show,"" I wanted to check it out for myself.  She knows I love that epoch, mostly the early '50's in the first season.  Women still innocent sometimes, men still chivalrous sometimes, everybody re-defining roles.

I also loved watching the seasoned midwives, the nuns in the House, relating to the young nurses that came along to make their way in the medical world, delivering babies, healing wounded hearts, and much more.  Their impoverished clientele trusted them and relied heavily upon them in post-war Britain.

So far, it is historically and emotionally true, and that's the best of story-telling to me.  The program in both very real and very tasteful, and my friend was right ... I do love it.",1379289600,7,753,4.7984496124031

5023186,5,B006W8CJ1W,Anyone watching this series will be pleasantly surprised. It covers a period in history whereby the passage of time has reduced the memory of those that led impactful lives. Conditions in some parts of post-war England were not exactly what one might initially expect for those of a victorious nation. The casting and writing of this series couldn't have been done better.,1379116800,,372,5.016129032258065

5023190,5,B006W8CJ1W,"The Call the Midwife Series are loosely based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth.  The book stories are a little more ""dry and technical"" than the two seasons.  But the Season is captivating and well worth watching.  The series deal with Abortion, Race, Interracial relations but they also beautifully depict Human nature.  The hard working nature of people in the Poorer parts of England, and how their life was affected by the lack of Birth Control and adequate Medical attention.  These seasons are typical of PBS productions.",1378944000,2,527,5.011494252873563

5023192,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I think the series is sweet, tender yet quite inspiring. I also appreciate how much the English people suffered after WW II.  I appreciated that this is based on a true story which makes it even more interesting. I think women as opposed to men would be more interested in this series.",1378771200,,285,4.480769230769231
5023193,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I LOVE this show! Was hooked after I saw the first episode and proceeded to watch every episode over the course of a week. Can't wait for the new season to start in 2014. The stories are moving and sometimes very sad, but there is also a healthy dose of British humor. Every actor in the entire series is outstanding. The music, fashion, and overall innocence of post-war London has been so interesting to learn about. I've even got my kids hooked on some of the music used in the show. I highly recommend this show and can't say enough good things about it!!",1378598400,4,559,4.384615384615385

The personalities of the Anglican nuns are fun because so often those in religious orders are given rather flat, one dimensional roles.

While the TV series followed the stories in the book most of the time, some stories were changed just a bit and it still worked well and at times even better.

Everything those Brits produce on BBC is always top notch, but CTW is absolutely outstanding!

Personally, I am not much of a TV watcher, but this particular series was promoted on my local PBS station, peaked my interest, and then I was hooked from the first episode. I particularly enjoy programming of an historical and/or dramatic nature. ""Call the Midwife"" is excellent in all regards!",1374537600,,516,4.8522727272727275

5023253,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Call the Midwife is such a great series. It's sweet, funny, and poignant all at the same time. The story of midwives working with nuns who work with women and home births in the mid-1950s in London. After a few episodes you feel like the midwives and the nuns are your friends. I highly recommend this entire series.",1374364800,,316,4.4655172413793105
5023254,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I think this may just possibly be the best television series I have ever watched--and I have watched a lot!  Once again the BBC has really pulled it off: five stars, a-plus, this merits them all. Sometimes hilariously funny, sometimes deeply moving, it consistently holds and rewards our attention.  The stories (which are true) are amazing, the acting excellent, and the production flawless. I am old enough to remember something of fifties London, and they have it right (except perhaps that the cars as I remember them back then were not quite so clean and shiny, and the saddleback shunting engine in the dockyards certainly wasn't!).  But how pleasant to see a group of Anglican religious portrayed for once on TV not as fools, objects of ridicule, or dangerous lunatics, but as what they so often really are--people of compassion, humor, common sense, and grace.  I would offer one caution--several of the reviews of this series that I have read compare it in one way or another to Downton Abbey.  Apart from the fact that both are British, the two series appear to me to have little in common.  Downton Abbey plays with stereotypes of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century, and is no doubt quite amusing (although not, I confess, to me).  Call the Midwife, based on the real memoirs of a real woman doing a real and important job in often very difficult circumstances, is something entirely different, and for my money infinitely more interesting and worthwhile.",1374192000,5,1481,4.876494023904383

This is all really interesting, but what drive the series is the richness of all the characters and the lives they are leading.  There was a Christmas special that I do not believe is included in this DVD, that was absolutely wonderful.  I hope that it is included in future offerings.

My baby brother John died through heart failure when he was 10 months old, I was three then (1947)and I don't remember much, only that I had to run and tell my mother if he was crying. They still had ""district nurses"" in the 1960's. I was treated at home by one (injections) suspected Tubercelosis, turned out to be pleurosy. They were cheerful, hard-working and not all that well-paid for all the training they had to undertake and the travelling involved. I enjoyed watching the series on German TV, especially the end.

The acting is the finest you will see today, the story is completely engaging and the costumes and filming are authentic and top notch. To my mind, this is a story of love. The love of the young parents for their children and the love shown to impoverished and downtrodden people from the nuns and the midwives. I also love the idea that people exist (existed??) who willingly give their lives to help such people. People who cannot ""benefit"" the young midwives and nuns in any way. This is pure love as Jesus taught. To help those who may revile you, misunderstand you or who cannot understand why you do what you do for them. Love in its purest form.

It is my understanding that it will. The acting, writing and production have been first rate.  Having viewed practically every BBC production from the First Churchills onward, I can't think of any that that have been more poignant and interesting that this one.

As a nurse I am usually critical of story lines that revolve around medical and nursing issues. But this series is very true to life and well done in relation to the way the nurses handle the problems they face. It is very realistic so if you don't want to see a baby arrive, you may want to skip some portions of the scenes. But those scenes are very dignified and appropriate. The stories give a very realistic portrayal of mother and baby care of the era. It is also very realistic about the social problems of families who live in poverty.",1368144000,,703,4.293233082706767

This takes place at the same time I emigrated at age 10 from the UK to USA so it was particularly nostalgic for me, even though this takes place in London and I am from Scotland.

These nurses and nuns deliver compassion and help to the women of the East End...and sometimes humor also.  After every episode my sister and I compare notes:  Did you cry, was it disturbing, did you like it?

This is just life at its basic, love, birth, people clinging to one another in their poverty and heartbreak, but always hope for the new life in whatever way or fashion it is delivered into this world.  Hope springs eternal with each new life....how true.",1366934400,,613,4.79047619047619
5023388,4,B006W8CJ1W,"'Call The Midwife' is a series shown on PBS that gives us the good in the world. Set in the 1950's in London's East End, all the help that is available is needed. We see the sorid, the poor, the love and the caringg from all concerned. We get to know all of the women and few men involved in this series.

The episodes revolve around  Jenny Lee , played by Jessica Raine  who becomes a midwife to do good but also to escape a romance. She joins two other women, and nuns including Sister Monica-Joan, played by Judy Parfitt,  and Sister Evangelina, played by Pam Ferris.nSister Julienne played by Jenny Agutter runs the place. Miranda Hart is the Camilla  or ""Chummy"" Fortescue-Cholmondeley-Browne, as the clumsy, clueless midwife who brings reality and some humor to the series.

This is a series of women helping other women, mostly delivering babies. N the process we see the real deal,sometimes shocking, but most often the lovely process  of bringing life into this world. Ths is a very popular series and Seres two is not far behind.

The births shown are VERY realistic.  I enjoy following Chummy and the Constable's relationship.  I think she may be my favorite character although I like them all.

I can't imagine anyone else playing any of the characters. It's the settings, though, that steal the show. It really shows like a step back in time and across the water. The music really helps to set the tone. It's gritty but beautiful.

5023434,4,B006W8CJ1W,"After watching one episode of this show, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to get through any others. The childbirth scenes had me squirming -- it was bad enough in real life! I have no desire to revisit the experience onscreen.

But I have to say, I continued on with the series because of the characters. The personal lives of the nurses and nuns kept me interested. The families they served were less interesting to me, because they were unbelievable. The show's depiction of life in the East End of London seemed overly optimistic to me.

It's hard to believe that in this notoriously poverty-stricken area, these women are all in love with their men and thrilled to have another child. One woman has 24 children, looks to be about 30 years old and acts like a honeymooner around her husband... and she can't even speak his language. Another woman has a mixed-race baby, although she and her husband are both Caucasian; he's the product of a one-night stand. And the husband is just hunky-dory with that, never even mentions it. The absent sailor who fathers triplets magically shows up and transforms into a loving husband and doting father. (Not to mention that the nurses wheel around on bikes through the docklands without a care in the world for their personal safety.)

That's what frustrated me about this series. It insists on a Pollyanna view of life, sanitizing a world that seemed more accurately depicted in shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/London-Hospital/dp/B003UPMK1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">London Hospital</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bramwell/dp/B0009NZ76U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bramwell</a>. A lot of talk about love and hope, which I'm all for, but just can't accept as a reality in this time and place. But like other shows lacking in reality (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B006VA57CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>), you can't take your eyes off the screen.",1363996800,10,2078,5.897009966777409

5023444,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Once again, British television triumphs. Why the executives and producers of Hollywood television don't take points on story-telling, is beyond me. There is a reason we flock to Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife, plus many other wonderful shows on PBS.  It's drama at its best, stories with heart, and actors who take us into the reality of other worlds.

Call the Midwife is a moving series set in post war early 1950's about a group of nurses and nuns who deliver babies on the impoverished east side of London. (I was born in 1950, so I fit right in.) The series instantly reminds you of the scriptures that declare the poor will always live among us. It is what we do for the poor that matters the most.

The series is, of course, geared toward women. After all, babies are delivered every episode.  The old ways of enema, shaving, and odd delivery positions is quite amusing, but so are the variety of women who bear the children and their midwives.  If you are prone to PMS, bursts of crying, or are pregnant make sure you bring a box of tissues with you as you watch.  The stories will move you to tears as you are faced with the stark reality of birth, life, death, suffering, love, and survival.

Each episode focuses upon a main pregnancy ranging from the woman who is married and on her 24th pregnancy (yes, they birthed that many children), to the young 15 year old prostitute who sells her body to survive and becomes pregnant.  One breach birth will keep you on the edge of your seat, as you watch the new awkward nurse deliver the child successfully.  You see the devastation of women losing their babies, and women who lose their lives giving birth.  You'll cry over the poor and the squalor in which they live.  At the end of each episode, you'll be a better human being for watching the miracle of birth and no doubt be thankful for what you have.

Call the Midwife is once again why I love the Brits.  It's drama, humor, life, and love all rolled into one.  It's reality, not fantasy. Frankly, I think watching this series births within you a new appreciation of life and love through all of its struggles.  You'll find empathy for the poor among us, and be thankful for what you have.  We shouldn't abort the difficulties of life in television shows just because we don't want to deal with the unpleasantness.  Frankly, I think viewers continually need excellent television such as Call the Midwife to deliver us out of our complacency.",1363392000,6,2457,4.547727272727273
5023445,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Love this series. It is such good wholesome television. I love the richness of the characters.

5023453,5,B006W8CJ1W,"A wonderful portrayal of London's impoverished bombed out East End in the 1950's when Britain was still struggling to rebuild itself after WWII. It's intelligent, erudite, clever, poignant and hilarious.  I laughed so hard I cried and often cried because I'm a sentimental fool when it comes to women, babies, childbirth and the triumph of the underdog.  Miranda Hart is exceptional as always.  She is an incredibly talented actress/comedian and while she's a unique talent she is following in the steps of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench. (I loved Maggie Smith's portrayal as the dowager countess of Grantham).  It may be a bit contrived at times but it's such great fun who cares!? I'm so pleased that the BBC is creating a season 2.

5023481,5,B006W8CJ1W,"In the fall of 2012 the first series of Call the Midwife was shown on PBS on Sunday evenings just before Masterpiece Theater.  When I read the reviews I first thought that this series about a young midwife working in the East End of London in the 1950s wouldn't appeal to me, but I decided to give the first episode a try.  Within five minutes I was completely captivated.

Jenny Lee is a young middle-class girl.  Trained as nurse, she goes to work at Nonnatus House, an Anglican order of nursing nuns in the East End, as one of a team of midwives.  At first she is appalled by the conditions in which the women she works with live and by the brutality and vulgarity of their lives, but soon she grows to respect and admire their courage, honor, and humor.  In turn they respect her for her steadfast determination to help them and their babies.

The six episodes in this first season are filled with unforgettable characters: Jenny and her fellow midwives, most memorably the gawky Nurse Chummy, who comes from an aristocratic family but takes on and succeeds with the most difficult cases; Sisters Evangelina, Bernadette, and Julienne from Nonnatus House: the ethererally batty Sister Monica Joan; and the women of the East End themselves like Conchita, mother of 25 children with endless amounts of love for them all or Mary, a 15 year old prostitute whose baby is brutally taken from her.  There are many more beautifully crafted characters in these six episodes, noone of whom will be easy to forget.

If you watched this series on PBS in the US you are in for a few surprises in this DVD set of the original British series.  PBS censored a few scenes here and there, most memorably a segment of Episode 5 in which Nurse Chummy bravely gives a class on male contraception (using a detailed prop or two) to a group of East End women.  At first the women are having a good time making ribald comments, but Chummy's sincerity and her obvious determination to help them eventually settles them down.  It's hilarious but deeply impressive to watch this scene, which by itself is worth the price of the DVD set.  DVD extras include some interviews with cast members, some of which were also shown on PBS at the end of each episode.",1362182400,,2231,4.589420654911839

Set after WWII, the innocence and social rules are fascinating, making me nostalgic but also grateful to this generation of women who paved the way for us to have less rules.

5023500,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I started watching Call the Midwife as it was recommended to me and I love a lot of BBC shows. While it's not as riveting as those shows, the character development and acting is spot on, and after a few episodes you feel invested. The stories they tell are heavily underrepresented and offer a new vantage point on the 1950s in London's East End. Especially being told from the view of a midwife, you get an idea of what the most dramatic moments of life boiled down to.

I started reading the book after watching the first season. I would highly recommend that, as well.",1361664000,,571,4.438095238095238

In the end, I was sorry when I saw the last episode and I wish there were more.  The plucky and dedicated young nurses are also seen as real, vulnerable and hopeful young women. The wise and nurturing or stern and dictatorial senior sisters are also seen as fully human with their own histories, regrets, foibles, and hopes.  Each episode brings a different drama related to the inhabitants of the east end, but this is far from a ""hospital drama.""",1361577600,,654,4.396694214876033

5023537,5,B006W8CJ1W,"This is a story of life in London in the 1950s. It is about the poor side of town near the river and the docks. It is filled with love and fun, sadness and death. The care of the midwives and the nuns ties the community together and it is filled with happy stories and sad. It is an example of a good TV series about human existence and the emotions that we all go through.

The acting, the script and directing is spectacular. It is a story of life that all people can relate to. It is well worth seeing and enjoying the series. The set is two DVDs with 6 episodes.

This is a wonderful story and I cannot say that enough. In the poverty and filth of the East London area Jenny Lee has dedicated her life to help the people. The middle class midwives and nuns help the poor in the area to deliver their children safe and healthy despite the poverty they live in.  The nuns and the midwife nurses live together in the Nannatus home.  It is part of the storyline that shows the interaction of religious nuns and young 20 year old nurses living together with their divergent life styles.

Jessica Raine did a wonderful job playing Jenny.  Jenny learns to have a faith in humanity. It is a time of change in England and in the 1950's and early 1960's there was an explosion of technology and enterprise. The heart of it was in the fifties when the story is written about. The area of London seriously needs help and the girls have committed to help the people who live there.  Jennifer Worth (Jenny Lee is her maiden name)  is who the story is about and she passed away 2 weeks before they started filming. I was sad to hear this as the woman must have been a saint!

The other characters in the series are also wonderful actresses and actors.  The storyline and drama of the series is played out to perfection and my wife and I enjoyed Season 1 immensely.  This show is a prime example of why American TV has lost its way in producing great television shows like this one.  I recommend it to you.

I received a sample DVD for viewing and I promised a fair and honest review.",1360022400,5,2072,4.255102040816326

Her life had already been disrupted by WWII and an intense affair when she was only 16. Worth's luminous observations on the human condition, our quest for meaning in the darkest despair, her pointing out what really matters, are strewn with keen compassion and intelligence.

Chummy is dominated by a cruel mother, yet she overcomes her limitations and discovers love. Among other fine cast members, Jenny Agutter is Sister Julienne, Helen George is Trixie Franklin, Pam Ferris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme/dp/B005DVIPY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme</a>) is the cake-loving Sister Evangelina, and Bryony Hannah is perfection as Cynthia Miller. Cynthia is moved by the tragedy of a deeply loving couple expecting their first-born, when the wife suffers from eclampsia. This show isn't for the faint-hearted, blood and birth are vividly depicted, as is the poverty and grime. But this grittiness only adds depth to the subject matter.

The characters are engaging and the stories compelling, with very good acting. I enjoyed this so much, I bought the book, which is excellent as well. Not only does it give us a view of life in a period of time before the advent of birth control, which many of us never see, but the characters become so real, and the problems they face so overwhelming, that we begin to see them in a totally different light. Rather than sitting in judgment of them for their situation, you begin to admire them for how they endure and sometimes flourish.",1359936000,4,683,4.34375

5023559,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Jennifer's Worth's memoir of being a young midwife in the poverty stricken East End of London in the fifties, here turned into a series for the BBC is genuinely moving and inspiring and makes the viewer think about many things - what it means to be a good person, how best to help others, why we as humans visit so much devastation upon each other. The shadow of the Workhouse hangs over this series and that shadow is both edifying and terrifying.

The plots deal with many real life issues, terrible living conditions, the forgotten poor and elderly, babies taken from their mothers for adoption without consent or care for the mother or the child, but most affecting of all is the Workhouse. An institution I thought was finished in Dicken's time but that in fact covers almost six hundred years of history. In the most affecting story, the cleaner for the nunnery and her brother were taken to the workhouse when the brother was seven and the sister was barely a toddler. There they were separated. The brother grew up and was released but refused to stop looking for his sister and once he found her, working until he could pay for her release. The two lived together for the rest of their lives, but Frank, is now diagnosed with cancer. How can these two possibly live without each other? Their happiness in each other and in simple pleasures along with the way the workhouse broke them of the ability to have a normal life will affect anyone with a heart.

Call the Midwife doesn't lecture, but I had to look up the history of the Workhouse and found that some form of Workhouse as punishment for the poor was extant in England from 1388 as a response to the depredations of the Black Death until 1948. Yes, you read that right, the Workhouse in England is still within living memory. That should sober us here in America when we are considering doing away with programs that help the poor and where our attitude has become punitive. Surely we can find a way to do better with many things in life, but punishing the disadvantaged can't be right for anyone. A look at the results shows that.

Perhaps because they are drawn from life, the characters are all amazingly well drawn. The young midwives each have a distinct personality, perhaps most memorably, the overly large, clumsy aristocrat who has fled her family's disappointment in her physical failings, called Chummy. Nor is this a saccharine call to be a good person. The people in these stories are good in the way that people actually are good in that they struggle with their faults, their prejudices and the stresses of the day to try and be kind to one another. When they manage this, as when we do, it is a triumph and that is why this is inspiring. The nuns aren't cut out religious, they are real women who have given their lives to their beliefs and who do better some days than others.

I cannot say enough about this wonderful series. I really did find it a soul stirring inspiration.",1359504000,7,2959,4.5668549905838045

It is an interesting period drama that provides a window into the lives of young midwives in post-WWII Britain, c 1957. The story lines can be tragic at times, but the overall impression the show gives is one of inspiration. Fortunately (so far) it avoids being too sappy, sentimental or melodramatic. The character Chummy adds a bit of comic relief, but is also an example of kindheartedness that is rarely seen in tv characters today. The show highlights the themes of love, forgiveness and perseverance. Although the focus of the show is the midwives, the East End families are often the heroes of the show--their personal triumphs, losses and sacrifices are quite moving.",1359072000,4,735,4.841269841269841

Set in the 1950's, the book, based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, follows the experiences of a young nurse named Jenny Lee who (to her surprise) arrives at an Anglican convent in London to work for the National Health system in one of the poorest parts of London.  The stories are compelling, the setting completly believable, and the acting superb.  While I find the main character both strong and sympathetic, I confess that I think the supporting cast steals the show, making this much more of an ensemble effort and endearing it to me even more.  My favorite storyline (so far) envolves an older father completely smitten with his baby--so surprising and poignant.  Now, I want to read the book, and I can't wait for the release of the next season in the U.S.",1358553600,4,912,4.530487804878049

5023609,5,B006W8CJ1W,"The naivete to poverty is what strikes the center of my heart with this protagonist.  The gumption of these women to take care and to celebrate life amidst the abject degradation including mold, hunger, bugs, filth, no running water and no privy among many other things.  Birth is a bloody and painful thing and they try, each character with its own way, to deliver innocent babes in this impossible environment.  The religious sisters, toughened to the ways of an impoverished world, guide with a firm hand, strict rules and a push to jump right in.  I loved this series and hope others watch it to see the relationship of the poor to life, how much birthing is just the same and circumstances, lucky or unlucky, still brings babies anew.",1358553600,5,739,4.705426356589148

But again the interaction of the characters, the comedy as well as the meladrama provide great entertainment.  I watched it on my portable DVD player (my belly theater) in the car, in the airport, as well as airborne.  It's so refreshing to watch uninterupted British drama, laced with comedy, without violence and gross graphic American productions.

Sat down to watch it on streaming last night and got so sucked in I watched 4 episodes in a row.  It is wonderfully engaging and though it is a different period (1959 I believe) and setting (midwives and nurses, no servants) than Downton, it has a similar feel to it.  I love period movies, whatever period.  The only caveat is unlike Downton, you probably don't want to put this on while you are eating your dinner..babies being born and other medical stuff in tenements etc.",1357516800,,650,4.391666666666667

bbc has, for some time, been the major player in period dramas adn now they have had the good sense to extend outward from the victorian period into other periods in history.

""midwife"" is entertaining on many levels.  it has solid stories, character development and a very talented cast of players.  the area in time and place that it occurs was not well known to me and my family so it was of interest there as well as the the subject matter, which continues to be timely.

i would also mention that the additional features were of interest (perhaps they will be expanded if/when a second series is commissioned?) the overall presentation was very slick and the pricing good.",1356220800,,858,4.6118421052631575

I enjoy the idea of the roots of my job, the way that nurses practiced, and the aspects of life being a young woman and a nurse in a community.  I think other nurses will feel that connection, but also women in general.  The stories of love and loss, life and death, are really the stuff that this show is made of.

The midwives cater to the lower middle class in the poorest areas of London's East End with woman having babies in sometimes the most deplorable situations. The acting is incredible and while I do have my favorite characters there isn't a single actor/actress on this show that isn't wonderful. Even if you feel this is not sometimes you will enjoy, give it a try you may be very surprised.  I have laughed and cried in almost every episode. Only on episode 6 Season 1 but will continue to watch until!",1355616000,3,675,4.307086614173229
5023730,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I just love this British drama. It has got all the right materials for a perfect drama, and they use the materials in the right place to make it so perfect. I do believe this is a better show than Downton Abbey, but not by much. I am very impressed with Jessica Raine's performance. She is like a newcomer for a show, and this is her role. I think this show should be nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe. I believe this show should not be best drama, but best acting. Of course, if this show was nominated for best drama, I would still route for Homeland. Downton Abbey is set in the 1910's, now 1920s, and this show is set in the 1950s London. I like this show cause it is different. Not many original ideas anymore, but this is perfect. They need to make more period dramas, and more further into history, like 1700s. But, props to the 1950s with 90% adults smoking and no language that is like today's dramas. More period pieces!! I love em.

5023734,5,B006W8CJ1W,"I really like this series. It's a window into a time and place long ago. Call the Midwife is a BBC period drama series starring Jessica Raine, Miranda Hart, Cliff Parisi, Jenny Agutter, Pam Ferris, Judy Parfitt and Vanessa Redgrave. It was created by Heidi Thomas based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth and set in East London in the 1950s. The first series of six episodes premiered in the UK on 15 January 2012. The series is produced by Neal Street Productions, a production company founded and owned by the film director and producer Sam Mendes, Call the Midwife Executive Producer Pippa Harris and Caro Newling.

Call the Midwife achieved very high ratings in its first series, making it the most successful new drama series on BBC One since 2001.[1] A second series of eight episodes of the show has been commissioned and will air in early 2013 with a 2012 Christmas Special.

The series follows four midwives serving in a depressed area of 1950s London.  They live in a nursing convent, and the nuns also assist in midwifery.

The stories are sometimes sad, as they deal with birth and death.  However, the performances of the lead actresses win you over and there is always a feeling of hope as these ladies continue to persevere.  There is also a great deal of humor, as the ladies find themselves in new and uncomfortable situations.

The narrator is Vanessa Redgrave.  She lends such class with her beautiful voice.

Highly recommend but definitely not for watching with the kids!",1354406400,,818,4.510204081632653

5023766,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Being a patriotic ""Yank"", I've steered clear of most every British television show (for the exception of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"") for all of my life. Even though loved by so many people all over the world, I've always considered shows produced by the BBC or British television on PBS as, boring time-pieces that I'd have no intrest in. My wife kept raving about one episode of ""Call The Midwife"" that she watched on our local PBS channel, so she decided to buy this first season.

This show's content seemed to go against almost everything I dislike about some of the ""Ladies Shows"" she watches. ""Just how many more programs about child birth can one person watch?"" I didn't want to give in, but as the DVD case sat next to the televison for over a week, I peeked on Amazon to read a bit about this program. With all of the positive reviews, I caved in and told her that when she started to view this show, I'd give it a look-at.

Being a man, am I supposed to like a show like this so much? I was immediately transported back to the late 50's in East London and from the moment Sister Monica Joan answers the door to Nonnatus House, I'm overtaken by this piece of brilliant British story telling.

Each and every character is brought to life with outstanding actors in each role, all of which I've never seen before. Each story is written with a bit of wit and lots of emotion. I usually only get choked up at funerals, but hell, I can't remember the last time I got teary-eyed watching a television program...during sad and happy moments.

I could go on for paragraphs about this show. Especially the ""Georgie-girlish"" character, ""Chummy"", who'll win you over once you meet her. I just want to let men know that it is okay to watch ""Call The Midwife."" It's a piece of television that should not be missed. And the best part...there is more to come.

And to show just how much one man can change, after viewing ""Call The Midwife"", I immediately went on-line here at Amazon and bought seasons 1&2 of ""Downton Abbey"" and can't decided which show I like best. Not that it matters. I've found a new love that my stubborn 53 year old self has always deprived itself of...a love for, and new adventure into British television programs.",1354060800,2,2237,4.5

5023780,5,B006W8CJ1W,"Just in the time for the holidays is the release of the new hit series that aired on BBC in the UK and on PBS in the United States. I recall reading an article in the TV Guide a few months about the show, but I had forgotten it was being aired. Luckily, I got an opportunity to receive a free copy of Season One in exchange of an honest review courtesy of BBC Worldwide Americas.

The series was created and written by Heidi Thomas (also created Upstairs Downstairs) and is based on the memoirs of the late Jennifer Worth. Set in the poverty-stricken East London in the 1950s, the series centers around a young Jenny Lee (played by Jessica Raine), who believes she is going to be working at a small hospital called Nonnatus House, but to her surprise, it is actually a convent. She quickly befriends the other nurses, Trixie and Cynthia, the handyman Fred, and the Sisters, Julienne, Evangelina, Bernadette and Monica Joan. Jenny is there mainly as a midwife, but she has other duties to attend to as well. Just like the other midwives, Jenny must ride a bicycle to visit her patients.

The second episode introduces another supporting character, a tall woman named Chummy Browne, who shows up at the Nonnatus House wearing a pink uniform. She is an oddball character that doesn't quite fit in with the other nurses at first. She can't even ride a bicycle when she arrives, but she learns by the end of the episode.

There are only six episodes in the first season, running about sixty minutes each, but each episode is extremely well written and the cast does a remarkable job with their parts. Vanessa Redgrave provides the narration for each episode as an older Jenny.

I'm well aware of what a midwife does, but my first thought was that the series would be boring. To my surprise, Call the Midwife is anything but boring. I became instantly addicted to the show after the end of episode one. I had no idea what life was like back in 1950 as I'm only a 31-year-old, so I more than enjoyed the little details from the costumes to the streets of East London. I knew that times were tough back then, but I didn't know the poverty was that horrible. The main character Jenny is adorable, but Chummy steals every scene she is in. I absolutely fell in love with the show. I recommend Call the Midwife Season One to everyone.",1353369600,18,2322,4.508313539192399

5023799,5,B006W8CJ1W,"After being led on and ultimately duped by the BBC's infuriatingly abrupt production of ""Inside Men"" (talk about a letdown), I was reluctant to commit to another one of their series so quickly.  [I guess you could call me doubly-reluctant as I thought BBC America's production, ""Copper,"" was a true dog.]  Eventually, the siren call of ""Call the Midwife"" proved too strong to resist. I consider myself fortunate to have succumbed to the series' charms. It's brilliant TV.

""Midwife's"" depiction of London's post-war, baby boom, pre-birth control East End is rich in look and feel.  The set and costume designers have done an incredible job to evoke the memories of that period.  Adding to the authenticity: the series is an adaptation of a memoir by Jennifer Worth, made all the more memorable by Vanessa Redgrave's stirring narration.  Redgrave - not seen - is the voice of the mature Jenny looking back at the period of her life.  Young Jenny Lee is indelibly played by Jessica Raine - a perfect choice.

As fans of Graham Norton's show, we were delighted by the presence of Miranda Hart as Jenny's colleague, Chummy Browne.  Hart is so winning and likable, you can't help but smile.  The scenes of her trying to learn to ride a bicycle are classics of physical comedy.

The midwives are housed in a convent. The sisters themselves form quite a line-up: the great Pam Ferris; the one and only Jenny Agutter; Judy Parfitt (whose written-off ramblings sound somewhat Shakespearean) and Laura Main, whose beauty can't easily be hidden beneath her habit.",1352505600,2,1552,4.908045977011494

5023805,5,B006W8CJ1W,"This series is addictive.  It is a series about a group of young women and their older female mentors who have found a true calling.  They have endless doubts about their ability to complete the tasks but they still find the courage to do what needs to be done.  Call the Midwife resonates with me for several reasons.  My grandmother did similar public health nursing work in a rural area of Illinois just before WWI.  She graduated from Nursing School in 1909 and was immediately sent out to do public health work in an under-served area.  Her work involved being the primary health care for those residents, including delivering babies and setting broken bones.  So, this series intrigued me when I first heard about it.  I have watched all the episodes so far and it lives up to its promise.  The situations are realistic about a time when England was just beginning to emerge from rationing and the National Health Service had begun to make a real difference in the lives of the poorest Britains.  There is the sense that poverty in 1957 was the same today in many ways but there are also cultural differences.  One thing I noticed was that most of the babies are born to married parents.  The parents were mostly working poor.  The men mostly had jobs and the women were stay-at-home wives and mothers even though the family struggled.  Children played the same kinds of games that most children played except they played in the streets.  The young nurses are true to their calling and to the time in which they lived. Women's Liberation was a long way off.  Like my grandmother, young nurses (unmarried women) couldn't live on their own without chaperones.  These nurses are essentially living in a convent.  My grandmother also lived in an all-female dormitory during nursing school and when she came back to work in the hospital as a widow during the Depression.  She had to send her two young sons to live with her mother on the family farm because she wasn't allowed to bring them with her.  The sequestration of professional women like nurses was an injustice to them and denied the existence of personal integrity.  I love the period music in the show.  The music sets a mood and seems to be almost a character in the drama.  The series is based on the memoirs of the main character, a young woman just qualified sent to work in London's East End.  Her older self is the narrator at the beginning and the end of each episode.  This lends a sense of authenticity and realism to the stories.  I enthusiastically recommend this series.",1352073600,35,2545,4.650224215246637

Her book was wonderful, truth told in novel fashion, told in the first person, as if you were there. As I read it I was thinking it would make a wonderful series. When I finished & went looking for more books by Worth & discovered that she not only had written numerous books from that period of her life but that indeed the UK already had a series airing there.

I didn't realize how far women have come in the medical field. This is about how midwives and Nuns help women deliver their babies with the best possible care when no one was doing much to help these poor women. Most delivered at home and some hardly ever stopped having babies, going from one pregnancy to another with not much time in between. The midwives are a great bunch of women and it shows how they come together from different backgrounds as a family to help each other.

8505473,5,B006W8CJ1W,"endearing, gritty real life stories from bicycling nurse/midwives in 1957 east end london. I started watching on PBS when I saw the scene where Chummy and Constable Noakes get together; good actors are required to pull off the awkwardness of nervousness; these actors deliver. I love the comeraderie of the characters and the service they provide to their patients. When I watch I feel part of the team and cared for. Beware, at least one baby born per episode; the acting is believable, very intense but done discreetly. all in all a good experience that makes you root for the providers of care to the real heroines.",1527033600,,618,4.785046728971962
