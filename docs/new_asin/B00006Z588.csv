1795921,4,B00006Z588,"If your not really ""into"" Japanese swordsmanship this video will be tedious to watch. It is very informative and technically precise... but the camera work REALLY stinks. And some of the material covered gets very repetitive. But, as compared to the other material available... this is about as good as it gets.",1016323200,2,311,5.0

7973355,5,B00006Z588,This is a good video to learn proper techniques. It also has the proper terms. A good over all learning experiance,1198972800,,114,4.476190476190476
7973356,4,B00006Z588,"I enjoyed the historical section at the beginning of this DVD. Although it is not the style of Iaido I practice, I picked up some very good techniques from it. I found as with it's companion DVD, The Art Of Fast Draw, the instruction was clear and concise and easy to follow. Pleased to have purchase it.",1180137600,,304,4.350877192982456
7973357,1,B00006Z588,"this dvd is a waste of time. it's just a rip off.

i do muso shinden ryu iaido n i have to say the techniques are all excecuted without zanshin at all. he seems to be rushing thru his techniques.....can't wait to get to the bank to cash in, perhaps?????

the tameshigiri part was okay tho. to the guy who was doing the cutting, parctice more. as i know the chopped parts aren't suppose to go into orbit, its supposed to alide off after a slight pause.

but i have to say i liked the old footage of the japanese doing the katas, wished there was more footage of that.

the final word is.....it might be captivating to biginners and people who do not have knowledge in iaido.....but not to those who have the knowledge.

ps....i wanted to givr a lower rating, but unfortunately the lowest i can givr is 1 star.",1106697600,13,808,4.2894736842105265
7973358,5,B00006Z588,"If you?re interested in swords or practice any of the Japanese Sword arts, this video is a must-see. It explains kata and techniques in great detail and now I know much, much more than when I started. This is the standard by which all others will be compared.",1090281600,6,259,4.416666666666667
7973359,5,B00006Z588,I would just like to say this Dvd is very instructional and informative. As a new practioner I found it to be very user friendly. I am impressed and glad that I made the investment.,1086825600,4,181,4.2
7973360,1,B00006Z588,"As mentioned in the other reviews, the publishers of this volume simply (and I do mean simply) copied a videotape of medium to low resolution and authored a DVD with a single menu item - PLAY.  The image quality is so bad in parts that it is difficult to discerne what's going on in the video, and the explanations about what the instructor is doing are sparse, if any are given at all.
Perhaps when the original video was mastered there wasn't much out there in the way of Japanese sword instruction.  If this is still the case, then there is a good market for some quality instruction and creative authoring.",1078185600,10,610,4.486486486486487
7973361,5,B00006Z588,This dvd shows sword techniques and kata clearly and slowly that are traditional and effective. This is the real deal. When you practice the kata presented in this dvd your mind really does become one with the sword. It is wonderful that this type information is available to anyone with an interest to learn such an ancient art.,1076976000,,329,4.689655172413793
7973362,3,B00006Z588,"As every school of Japanese sword training has different techniques, I cannot criticize the abilities of any of the demonstrators.  They do seem to know their styles.  The presentation, multiple angles and explanations are done well. I was surprised that the gentleman demonstrating cutting did not have his saya tied into his hakama, but he did a good job explaining the basics he wanted to cover.
The information presented gives a brief overview of the history of the samurai.  There are many other excellent sources of information on Japanese martial arts, including:  Donn Draeger's Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts (available at a nice price through amazon.com); some of Diane Skoss' books (also available here); koryubudo.com and shutokukan.org
The key to any martial arts training is to train with a legitimate sensei. The only way to truly learn the way of the sword is to continually practice.  Watching this video is a good introduction, but without someone to watch your form, you will not know if you are developing bad habits or doing something wrong.
I would have given this DVD 4 stars if it had included a chapter search and if the video quality was better.  The material covered was worth the price.",1076025600,12,1217,5.0
