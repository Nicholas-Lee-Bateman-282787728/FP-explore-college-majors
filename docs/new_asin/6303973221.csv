However, the best speeches of LBJ were when he did not have a prepared text. Then, and only then , do we see the full free flowing brilliance of LBJ. But sadly in this tape they all set texts. Moreover, it would have ben rather cute to have had speeches he gave before 1964. For example, speeches from 1948 are available. So even if there were no film we could have had a montage of stills. His 1948 speeches in the Texas Primary against Stevenson are electric. Perhaps this could be on a follow up video?",999129600,2,659,4.32258064516129
8164739,5,6303973221,"The only real fault of this collection is that 3-5 more speech excerpts would have made it perfect.  But what we do get is an excellent study in a speaker who could be terrific -- and could be awful -- and a very fair sample of both.  Johnson was very much a creature of his speechwriters, and the early speeches on this tape -- the 7/27/63 JFK eulogy, the State of the Union 1964, and the 7/2/64 announcement of the signing of the Civil Rights Act -- were all written by Ted Sorenson, the same speechwriter who wrote the best-remembered JFK addresses.  Sorenson had the knack for finding the voice of the man he was writing for, and writing in that voice, so that it sounds like the best possible words from that speaker's heart.
Then we get to see Johnson speak off the cuff on Vietnam, and we see him at his worst -- strained analogy, badly overdone  folksiness, tendentiousness bordering on querulousness.  A couple more specimens of this, and then the speech announcing that Federal troops would be required to suppress the Detroit race riot, all have the same aggressive, ugly tone, and are lacking in the primary requirement of ethos -- that you want to feel that this speaker is one of you.  Johnson had a gift for making the defending the war in a way that made hawks cringe and for defending domestic social programs in a way that made the liberals who supported them wince, and it's all too well on display here.
And yet, strangely enough, the one speech to which he made major contributions in the writing, on this tape, is the 3/31/68 ""I shall not seek nor will I accept ..."" speech, quitting the Presidential race, and it's a highly competent, and moving, speech (we actually only get the last 1/3 of it, the first 2/3s being a standard Johnson Vietnam speech).  But that was Johnson -- a mass of contradictions to the end.
Sound quality is excellent on all speeches.  There are virtually no ""nostalgia footage"" clips of the type that are so annoying in this series.  Almost all cuts are continuous; 3 speeches are shown complete.  Excellent tape for any teacher of rhetoric or public speaking, especially for questions of ethos, trust, etc.  Excellent chance to study some early forms of the ""sincere mode"" in American speech delivery.  And the speeches chosen are mostly historically significant (though would it have killed anyone to have at least included one of the Great Society speeches (say the ones announcing Head Start or Medicare?) and at least one spaceflight announcement?)  The public eulogy for the Apollo 1 fire, and the Farewell Address (ho-hum as a speech but another good example of the mixing of best and worst) would have rounded the collection out nicely.
Those quibbles aside, this is a great tape for public speaking, history, and rhetoric teachers, and I recommend it without reservation.",973382400,3,2828,4.723577235772358
