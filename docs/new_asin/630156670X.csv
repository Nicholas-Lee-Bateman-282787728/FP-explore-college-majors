7812646,4,630156670X,I thought this movie was great.  Only problem i had while watching it was it was a lil too dark sometimes and you could not see everything going on.  I know great b movies when i see them and this is one. Would prob have given it 5 stars except for the lighting.  Definitely worthy of a blu ray release in my opinion.,1445558400,,317,4.0
7812647,3,630156670X,"A city that travels through time is attempting to escape cyborgs who follow them and want to kill them all. The cyborgs live in the ground like Transformers, but they only come out at night because they are light sensitive, even though they are encased in steel. Carrie Fisher headlines the film but is more of a co-star coming off a successful Star Wars trilogy gig and working her way down. Half the conflict involves the local sheriff and idiot deputy. PLOT SPOILER: Their town gets left burning as a small scale ""First Blood"" another film influence.  The opening scroll giving us the plot was similar to that other Carrie Fisher film.

The film has camp cult value and is available on a four-pack with similar films.

7812648,1,630156670X,"Production values are soggy, plot is mildly incoherent, acting is wooden and sound editing makes listening challenging. Other than that, very few redeeming qualities to this short-term-memory-loss-inducing oeuvre.",1366675200,,213,6.642857142857143

7812650,3,630156670X,"i've been looking for this movie for years and i'm glad i finaly found it.
it's a fun movie to watch and the effects arn't bad at all for a b-movie.

7812651,3,630156670X,"I'll be honest, I'm a fan of B-movies, especially unknown sci-fi from the 80s, which this is.  For what it is, I actually really liked this.  The story is fairly original, though like so many bad sci-fi before it, it rips off most successful sci-fi films.  Carrie Fisher stars in this film, and she seems to STILL be playing princess leia, as her character is pretty much the same.  If you like cheesy but fun sci-fi, this is definetly worth watching.  If you do watch it, note a scene early in the movie when there is a scrolling marquee in the background.  A line of letters and numbers are scrolling across it, and if you look close, you will see R2-D2 and C-3PO scroll by.",1170028800,6,676,4.368
