5735115,4,B00CQRNM32,"Hullabaloo Collection 1 is an 55 minute compilation of clips from the first season of the show, when Hullabaloo filled an hour-long time slot on NBC. However, to say these songs are a disjointed hodge-podge of selections, would be wrong. The producer decided, probably wisely, to base this set upon two shows, the Bobby Vinton-hosted March 9th '65 episode, and the March 2 '65 show, headed by Trini Lopez. Although both episodes are obviously edited, they are spliced together quite well, and are quite representative of the Hullabaloo style. The acts that are edited out were the lesser-known acts, and although personally I would have much preferred to see the shows unedited, the producers thought otherwise.

Of course, the dvd is composed totally of black & white kinescopes, as all but three of the master video tapes were wiped decades ago. A nice bonus is a current interview with Leslie Gore, who discusses her memories of Hullabaloo and the sixties.

If you're a fan of Hullabaloo, The Best Of Hullabaloo Collection 1 is worth picking up.",1379721600,8,1048,4.948863636363637

Here's a short list of what they could've added (I know a few of these are on these new volumes and the older releases, but the musicians performed multiple songs and some were on multiple episodes, so there's a wealth of unreleased material out there)......

The Yardbirds
Gerry & The Pacemakers
The Hollies
The Bobby Fuller Four
Smokey Robinson & The Miracles
The Vogues
The Byrds
Paul Revere & The Raiders
Gary Lewis & The Playboys

...and on, and on.  The only volume even slightly interesting is Volume 3, because of The Animals and Dusty Springfield. MPI Video has always been one of the worst......",1379203200,8,1053,4.801104972375691
5735117,5,B00CQRNM32,"I loved this show when it was on. Have all the early DVD sets. Now here is more on DVD. I just saw on PBS a best of these shows, and some were in color and the quailty was much better than the black and white. So where are those color shows? I also know I saw a lot more music artist on the show when it aired on TV in the sixties. I wish they would just release the entire series in a box set and quit dribbling it out a little at a time. I did manage to get the complete Shindig a few years ago.

Well if you search hard enough on the net you can find the complete series all 48 shows!! I just found it!!",1376611200,6,606,3.6615384615384614
5735118,4,B00CQRNM32,"For fans of the 1965-1966 Hullabaloo show, MPI is bringing more great performances to dvd in a Best Of Hullabaloo series consisting of 4 separate dvd's available September 10th, 2013. In 2000 to 2002, MPI produced Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12. In these older Volume sets, MPI included some of the Hullabaloo shows on dvd, all in their entirety. The film quality was not the greatest, but seeing the entire shows were fabulous! These Volume Sets from 2000-2002 are now priced out of most people's price range, so being able to purchase these new Best Of Hullabaloo 4 different sets may be a nice alternative.

I truly wish MPI would have made more of the Volume Sets, which include the Hullabaloo Shows in their entirety, instead of these 4 Best Of sets, but I'm happy with any of the old Hullabaloo performances, so I'll take what I can get. I heard the film quality is just like the older Volume Sets- not the greatest, but MPI is including 16-17 performances on each dvd and some fabulous bonus material. MPI always includes great bonus material when they can get it for their dvd's, and they did get some great interviews for these 4 Best Of dvd's. I did try and compare the performances on these Hullabaloo Best Of dvd's with my 2000-2002 Hullabaloo Volume dvd's, and I can only say I found maybe a couple duplicate performances. So, even if you own the Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12, you will enjoy these Best Of performances, of which most are not included in the Volume Sets.

I will list the performances MPI is including in this Best Of Hullabaloo: 1, along with the Bonus Interview, so you can decide if you want it or if you want to compare it to the Volume Sets- if you own them. For the money, this is a great buy, but it is not what I wished for, which would have been a continuation of the Hullabaloo Volumes of the complete shows- only digitally remastered! I love seeing these old Hullabaloo performances again, but seeing the entire old shows with remastered film would have rated 5 Stars, instead of the 4 Stars I'm giving this dvd. The performances alone, the fabulous interview material and great price still rate 4 stars with me, as I know I'll still enjoy going back to 1965-1966 viewing these great stars again in their prime. Here is what you will find on this Best Of Hullabaloo: 1:

01.) Bobby Vinton- There Ain't Gonna Be An Opening Number
02.) Barbara McNair- Don't Rain On My Parade
03.) Johnny Rivers- Midnight Special
04.) Chad & Jeremy- If I Loved You
05.) The Four Tops- Just Ask The Lonely
06.) Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas- It's Gotta Last Forever
07.) The Hullabaloos- I'm Gonna Love You Too
08.) Bobby Vinton- You Are My Sunshine
09.) Trini Lopez- If I Had A Hammer
10.) Lesley Gore- Sunshine, Lollipops & Rainbows
11.) Lesley Gore- All My Life
12.) The Chad Mitchell Trio- You Were On My Mind
13.) Dionne Warwick- Who Can I Turn To?
14.) The Astronauts- Twist & Shout
15.) Jerry Stiller & Anne Meara- Comedy Routine
16.) Trini Lopez ,Dionne Warwick & Lesley Gore- Puff, The Magic Dragon
17.) Trini, Dionne, Lesley & Cast- Lemon Tree
BONUS: Interview with Lesley Gore!",1376438400,43,3186,4.595782073813708
8585165,3,B00CQRNM32,"I bought all four, and they are rather disappointing in my opinion. Sure it brought back some memories, but the cuts they used for this series are not the best ones. It's like they used the ""B"" side of an album instead of the ""A"" side. The few top performers of the day that they show are not even performing their best songs. They also have some comedy acts as fillers that are pretty lame. And the bonus features are not all that great either. I had originally ordered a used set of the original full series, but Amazon lost them in the mail, so I thought these would be a good second best. I was wrong!",1495756800,,605,4.17948717948718
