8313014,5,B001FWY012,"Finally watched this wonderful documentary, had the DVD for a couple years, and with everything happening in our political climate (here in the U.S.A.), the timing couldn't have been any better to see this!!  This is a movie that focuses on a revolution by the people, and the corruption that they no longer wanted, and the brainwashed who are simply misinformed. Definitely worth a watch. Although this involves the Kremlin, this is as important today as it was when this documentary was made. Check it out. A+",1494374400,,511,4.873563218390805
