8370071,4,B002GWDD2M,"This was a great alternative for me as there were no trainings in my state at the time. I use the materials often with the couples I work with. I wish level II had a bit more than info on becoming a trainer or certified practitioner. The activities are helpful but somewhat basic and I find I go through them pretty quickly. I was hoping level II offered more complex work for couples who are more resourced. I purchased most of the additional materials as well that I give to couples, but again, although really helpful and good info, it's not much and I ""run out"" of things for them pretty quickly.",1485388800,,600,4.366071428571429
