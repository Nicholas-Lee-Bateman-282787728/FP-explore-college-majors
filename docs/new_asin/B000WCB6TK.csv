8222367,4,B000WCB6TK,"This is one of the DVDs from the Woman's Health & Fitness Network (WHFN), a series created by Anna Benson after she left The Firm, the exercise company she co-founded.  The series is specifically designed for middle-aged women and offers a variety of exercise options (e.g., substituting household items for weights), but the workouts are appropriate for any age.  Upper Body Burn is a cardio/weights interval workout with an upper body strength focus.  It is led by veteran instructor Keli Roberts; according to the DVD case, it includes 25 minutes of weights, 13 minutes of cardio, 10 minutes of yoga, and 7 minutes of Pilates, but I clocked it at 56 total minutes.

This DVD is well-chaptered (chapters can be accessed when you choose ""Select Tune"" off the main menu).  I have provided a chapter list below along with some brief comments:

1) Cardio--Push Circle. This was the warm-up, which was just under 4 minutes and included a lot of moves to open the arms and shoulders as well as some balance work.

2) Weights--ND (non-dominant) Row and Push.

3) Cardio--5 Limb Delts. This was pretty slow, mellow cardio.

4) Weights--ND Row and Sweep.

5) Cardio--Pump and Punch. More energy here.

6) Weights--ND Chest and Tri's. The tricep move was very interesting; you lay on your side and push your body up with your hand on the block--it's sort of a side push-up, and I definitely felt it!

7) Weights--Guns and Delts.

8) Weights--D (dominant) Chest and Tri's.

9) Cardio--Walkin' Stick. The stick wasn't really essential to this segment; it mostly added a bit of flair the the moves.

10) Weights--D Row and Push.

11) Weights--Tris and Delts.

12) Weights--D Row and Sweep.

13) Yoga--Towel Rotation. Here, you sit on your tall box and use a towel to peform some of the stretches, such as cow-face arms (a yoga strap would also work).

14) Yoga--Balance. There is a brief balance segment, but this section consists mainly of modified sun salutations using the tall box.

15) Pilates--Ball Core. There really isn't that much Pilates here, but you do the double leg stretch, rolling like a ball, and bridge as well as some traditional crunches.

16) Weights--Pec Flyes. Lat pullovers are also included here.

17) Pilates--Bridge. This is actually all of the abs moves performed on the second side.

18) Yoga--Pretzel. Actually, I think this final stretch is more like a Pilates move, the Mermaid.

From the above description, you'll see that the non-dominant side of the body is worked first, which I like. However, I found the sequencing of the exercises to be somewhat confusing--ie, the way you perform certain exercises on one side of the body and then do a whole lot of other stuff before finally moving on to the second side of the body. Similarly, I was often confused by Keli's positioning:  the mirrors on the set made it even more difficult for me to figure out exactly where I should be, and her cuing sometimes came a bit late.

There is also I DO like about this workout. I really appreciate the fact that the weight work is challenging, yet doesn't leave me feeling totally wiped out.  Similarly, the cardio is short and fun, yet it gets my HR up enough for an aerobic benefit. Although I wouldn't exactly call the stetching segments ""yoga"" (to me, it's not yoga when you're wearing shoes), you do get in some decent yoga-inspired stretches. Finally, I find that the time goes by quickly for this workout, and even after owning it for over six years now, I still enjoy doing it.

This is probably not for the hard-core, advanced weights exercisers, but it's a nice choice if you're looking for a solid, somewhat unique intermediate workout, and I would definitely recommend it.",1323907200,4,3694,4.802215189873418
