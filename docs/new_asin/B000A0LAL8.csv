2756873,3,B000A0LAL8,"The plot was okay ... and predictable in some ways.  Almost took on the flavour of being a musical ... it was quite obvious that the actors were not actually singing the music and it was dubbed in.  I mean, where would one find room for a 26 piece orchestra on the deck of a sailboat?",1368489600,,284,4.053571428571429
2756874,1,B000A0LAL8,"Captain Calamity is an ancient B movie. To its credit, as with many movies of its age, the plot is jolly. But that can't save it from a 1 star rating. Perhaps 75 years ago this was the pinnacle of exotic destination feelgood blockbusters. Probably not.",1333670400,,252,4.5
2756875,4,B000A0LAL8,"You have to like B westerns and similar silliness to like this film. Tropical settings, sailing vessels, lusty songs, bad people, not so bad people, good people, are all part of the fun. It is Indiana Jones done in the 30s and without a college degree.",1292889600,,252,4.5
2756876,5,B000A0LAL8,Wow is this a great movie for a night with the girls. The lead actor George Houston is seriously hot and he's either dressed like a sailor or on a hot island beach wearing almost nothing most of the time. Plus there is a serious romantic plot and pirates and gold. It is so much better than Pirates of the Carribean I can't even begin to describe it. The guys are hot and the story is just intense. The is a great girl movie!,1154044800,,425,4.071428571428571
2756877,5,B000A0LAL8,"It's interesting that during the Great Depression when almost nobody could afford to set sail on any of the great ocean liners, so many, many films of the era were set on board ships.

You had films about ships sinking. You had films about killers on boats. You had voyages around the world. And, like with this film you had films about romance onboard ships.

This is a romance film with just enough action thrown in to make guys be willing to watch it with their girlfriends.

The name sort of implies that it might be a comdedy.

It isn't.

It's a standard boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back romance.

But it works.",1146700800,,634,4.3760683760683765

8174960,3,B000A0LAL8,"Pretty much exactly what I expected, an enjoyable knock em sock em treasure hunt, with some fairly decent acting.",1465344000,,113,5.0
8174961,1,B000A0LAL8,"Poor plot, bad acting, worse musical.  Avoid.",1457136000,,45,5.428571428571429

8174965,5,B000A0LAL8,"Another star performance from Houston. Great movie with action, a plausible story line and a great ending. Well worth watching.",1435276800,,127,5.4
8174966,2,B000A0LAL8,Predictable and a little slow in the action that we expect today in a movie.  Very old movie but the end of it was very vague.,1431734400,,126,3.8461538461538463
8174967,3,B000A0LAL8,"...white, of a time when movies were definitely made a bit differently... perhaps not so polished as I would have hoped... But consider when it was made and you give it some slack... for the most part it was just OK... not quite a waste of time",1377302400,,244,4.212765957446808
