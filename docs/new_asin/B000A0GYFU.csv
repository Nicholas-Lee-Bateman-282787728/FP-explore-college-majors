2347277,5,B000A0GYFU,Yes. I think it's great!  It is basically the book being read with the pictures and more pictures added for visuals. The camera focuses on different parts of the pictures that fit the script. It also zooms in and out and moves across the page. It is done well. It is not like a movie though and that is why some people are disappointed. It is just what I was looking for. I loves the book by the same title and I love hhis DVD too. Thanks,1400457600,5,438,4.0344827586206895

Technology will allow the future one world leader to control by determining who can buy or sell ( chip under the skin). This old Christian classic is presented in beautiful pictures with voice backgrounds is a great presentation of how Christians can escape the wrath to come through the Cross of Jesus Christ and how to get through a life of temptations and trials ( all dramatized in allegorical fashion) to reach the end of the goal, heaven.",1389657600,,570,4.543689320388349

2347281,5,B000A0GYFU,"This video is off the illustrated book, but was done very well. The panning and sounds make this interesting to children and adults alike while showing great ""pictures"" of the real purpose of life. I would highly reccomend the book and this video.

Hope you enjoy it as much as our little family does!",1343692800,,301,4.574074074074074
2347282,5,B000A0GYFU,"A brilliant retelling of The Pilgrim's Progress. It is narrated by Paul Copley  who has just the right voice, altho' it states on Amazon's description that the actor is Michael Kramer. I was delighted to find that Paul Copley, the original narrator, was narrating my copy of it from Amazon. Not at all disappointed that it wasn't Michael Kramer. The Pilgrim's Progress is a thought-provoking story, but one which I think would be too difficult for the modern child to read. This dvd presents the story very well & very faithfully.  I look forward to watching it with our granddaughter.",1295222400,6,585,4.84
2347283,5,B000A0GYFU,"This is an amazing rendition of an amazing classic.  My young children (4&6) have asked for it to be read over and over, often prompting serious theological discussions about our journey through this life and God's wonderful plan for each of us!  The pictures explain the message very well and although I wondered about the fear-factor, there was NONE!  I highly recommend this book to all!!!",1227139200,6,392,4.909090909090909
2347284,2,B000A0GYFU,"This is a 135 minute film consisting of nine 15 minute segments. The first 8 segments are Christian's pilgrimage. The ninth segment is Christiana's pilgrimage.

It consists of a series of still pictures with one narrator narrating it. I would actually rather just read the book.",1209600000,14,278,5.043478260869565
2347285,5,B000A0GYFU,"Written while in prison by John Bunyan in 1676, The Pilgrim's Progress has, for centuries captured the hearts of children and adults alike.  Dangerous Journey establishes children to the basic themes of the Christian life. Lively characters and spellbinding situations, portraying the challenges of a life devoted to Jesus Christ, will make a critical and lifelong impression. Perfect for home use, children's church and Sunday school.

The DVD informs us of the story of Christian's journey from his home in the ""City of Destruction"" to the ""Celestial City"". The journey is filled with danger as he faces the intimidating temptations of Hypocrisy, Mr. Worldy Wisman, Mistrust and others; enters in fierce battle with Apolloyon; and comes face-to-face with many other dangers and temptations - all in the wish of reaching the Celestial City.

The film is 135 minutes, complete with 15-minute programs and in color.",1156550400,6,914,5.289655172413793

8071599,5,B000A0GYFU,"This is one a few non-live action films telling a story based on a book.  It can be watched by adults without becoming boring.  Instead of relying on live action or animation, the film uses the artwork from the book, which is very good, and very good narration and voice acting with some sound effects.  I appreciated these things aside from the story of the Pilgrim's Progress itself.  This film is good for children not old enough yet to read the full book.  Note that there are a couple of changes in the narrative from the original story, even as a short summary of the full work.",1455580800,2,584,4.420560747663552
