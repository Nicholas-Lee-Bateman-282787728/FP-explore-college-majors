2060312,1,B00023P4R4,This is not anything like the original Sting.  I thought it would be a worthy follow up but it was just strained.  I would not recommend it.,1140739200,5,140,4.148148148148148
2060313,1,B00023P4R4,"This movie might have been ok if it was a story on its own, rather than trying to be a sequel to ""The Sting"".  First off, how can you possibly replace Redford and Newman?  Second and critical, which is really a non-negotiable fact from the first movie - Doyle Lonnegan did NOT KNOW he was stung by Gondorf and Hooker.  How could he possibly be out for revenge if he didn't know?  Plus, he saw them ""die"" just before he was pulled out of the club.  Even if he realized that he was set up and taken, who would he go after - the dead guys?  Changing critical facts from the first movie creates a sequel which makes no sense and does not deserve to associate itself with the original.  If you pretend it's a totally unrelated movie with different character names, it's ok - but that's about it.",1116374400,14,790,4.261744966442953
2060314,5,B00023P4R4,"Forget the fact that different actors replace those from the original, forget the 10 year gap between the two films and forget what others have said about this film. Quite simply this is the best film ever made. The script is suberb, the acting is the best you will ever see and the story is highly original. Just like the first film when Special Agent Polk is revealed as being in on the con at the end, I can reveal that this film is dire. I think that, that is the real sting.",1094601600,7,479,4.161290322580645
2060315,1,B00023P4R4,"Save your time and money and stay away from this horrible excuse of a sequel to the 1973 classic.  How in the world can ANY actor fill the shoes (in the same roles) of Robert Redford and Paul Newman???

2060325,3,B00023P4R4,"Another reviewer wisely suggested that you forget that it is supposed to be the characters from the original, and just enjoy it, such as it is. My personal favorite bits were any scene with Oliver Reed in it. We got a few chuckles out of it. If you try to place it as a successor to the original, your opinion of it would have to drop by at least a full star. And how on Earth did they manage to fail so miserably with the music, which was such an important part of the ""franchise"", and to do so with Lalo Schifrin doing the music? Very odd. For light, disposable, fare, it's a fine entry. Expect nothing more and you will not be disappointed.",1432944000,3,643,4.193548387096774

2060357,2,B00023P4R4,"This movie was much slower than the original, and the change of actors didn't help.
The wow factor that made the original ol popular was altogether missing, and even the sting itself was disappointing.
I thought Teri Garr played her part well - the best of the bunch.",1398729600,,267,4.583333333333333
2060358,5,B00023P4R4,"I love being fooled, and because this somewhat mirrors the first Sting, I was expecting the same things to happen, that didn't.  it does have a complicated weave, and the actors were all perfectly cast.

2060360,5,B00023P4R4,All star cast and a repeat story sequence that works because of the cast more than the story. Even knowing that it would all come together. A better than average sequel  film. Glad that I did buy it!,1379462400,2,199,4.2368421052631575
2060361,5,B00023P4R4,"This film suffers from its comparison to the original. Of course, if you make a film with the same characters (or near the same), name it the second version of the first, this is what you will get. In the end, that was a bad idea. It never let the film stand on its own. I can understand why it was done from a commercial stance, but then it left the audience with certain expectations regarding the storyline and character behaviors. Those criticisms are understood. The storyline is not consistent with the original. The characters are different. They act different to the point of even contradicting what you would expect. So if you think it is really The Sting II, you will be disappointed.

Given all of that, if you think of the film as the Sting II ONLY in its characteristic con, this is really a fantastic film! Look at the list of actors. They do not disappoint here. If you like the idea of cons--like in the original--you will like this film!",1375228800,6,954,4.482758620689655

2060364,3,B00023P4R4,"I'll add my same thoughts that many have had:  The movie in no way compares to the first.  I bought the movie because I am a hard core boxing fan and have tried to acquire as many boxing movies or themes about boxing as possible.  If this element wasn't in the movie..........I wouldn't have bought it.

Still, while ""The Sting"" hovers over this movie.....watching it on it's own merit, the movie has some good moments.  Jackie Gleason carries the movie on his back while the lovely Terri Garr adds spice and glamor.  Mac Davis is in a word:  enh.

Not a classic but not bad.",1358035200,,575,4.40952380952381
2060365,3,B00023P4R4,"Obviously nothing can beat the original and when none of the original stars are in it
you wonder why they even bother to call it Sting 2.

2060368,5,B00023P4R4,"Most movie sequels aren't as good as the originals.  This one is better.

Jackie Gleason, Mack Davis, Teri Garr, Karl Malden, Oliver Reed, and a great supporting cast make this one a masterpiece.  This time it's a boxing scam instead of a horse-racing one.  The Doyle Lonnegan character is really creepy this time, played well by Oliver Reed.  There are multiple double crosses.

I recommend it.",1304726400,3,395,4.909090909090909
2060369,5,B00023P4R4,"Almost 20 years ago I saw the film ""The Sting 2"" on VHS, but after DVDs came to world Icouldn't fint it anymore in Brazil (where I live), no DVDs rentals had it... for my & my parents frustration.

The bad guys are out for revenge having been stung in the first episode and the good guys are out to really sting them again.  This film is not really a comedy but you cannot help but chuckle every so often as the plots unfold. The depression is over and evryone is looking to get a larger piece of the action and it is just one con after another to achieve that goal.

2060372,2,B00023P4R4,"What do you do when you've made one of the biggest hits of all time but no amount of money can tempt your cast or director back? You pay the writer whatever he asks (then pay him even more not to direct after his directorial debut, Cannery Row, flops), hope that no-one will notice that Paul Newman and Robert Redford have turned into Jackie Gleason (well, if you can't get The Hustler, hire Minnesota Fats) and Mac Davis and put a II after the title. Or at least that's what Universal did in 1983 with The Sting II (aka The Next Sting), having learned nothing from the box-office failure of Butch and Sundance: The Early Days. One of that surprisingly large band of sequels to blockbusters that time has completely forgotten, it has the feel of a TV pilot with slightly better production values and little beyond the basic plot device. Curiously even the first names of many of the characters are changed - Henry Gondorff becomes Fargo Gondorff and Johnny Hook*r becomes Jake Hook*r: why is a mystery since they're clearly meant to be the same characters since Doyle Lonnergan is out to kill them (though he's undergone a complete character transformation in Oliver Reed's literate incarnation).

This time it's a boxing scam involving Karl Malden's brash racketeer and Teri Garr's conwoman, but the con's mostly on any unsuspecting audiences expecting any of the style or ingenuity of the original. It's the kind of film that did no-one any favors: director Jeremy Paul Kagan was once the next big thing until this flopped spectacularly, Jackie Gleason went on to another forgotten and unwanted sequel, Smokey and the Bandit 3 while Mac Davis disappeared into guest spots on TV and living off the royalties for In the Ghetto. David S. Ward shows that he could have been a serviceable b-movie scribe at one of the smaller studios in the 30s, but it really needs the kind of ensemble a Warners Bros. could have given it in the 30s - Cagney, O'Brien, Allen Jenkins, Joan Blondell et al - to have ever had a chance to pass muster. The opening title cards, however, are things of real beauty and it's a shame they have to end and the movie has to start",1202860800,5,2149,4.640419947506562
2060373,5,B00023P4R4,"This is a movie that I will defend to the end. The problem is that it is tied to an Academy Award winning picture. Yes, different actors play the roles (with different first names) but the film is only ""loosely"" tied to the original. Jackie Gleason is in dapper form as the ring-leader and he is surrounded by a fine and funny supporting cast. The film uses nostagia in all areas well. It is downright goofy at points but it never tries to be anything more. The scene where Gleason mocks Karl Malden's character is (to me) a classic.  Mac Davis is suprisingly good and Teri Garr always makes me smile. I'm glad they put this on DVD for the few fans the film has. Nice widescreen print with a cool trailer. I never said this was a better film than the original. I just think it is unfairly over criticized.",1144800000,27,805,4.33112582781457
8021548,4,B00023P4R4,"I first found this movie on Showtime in the early eighties, and it quickly became one of my guilty pleasures.  Is it The Sting?  Of course not.  The Sting is one of the greatest movies of all time.  And if you're going to compare it to that standard, of course you'll be disappointed.  But can it be a very entertaining 100 minutes ""in the spirit of"" The Sting?  Absolutely.  Just go in looking for a light-hearted comedy, and you CAN enjoy it.  Trust me.  Jackie Gleason, Karl Malden and Oliver Reed are all great.  Mac Davis is even pretty good as Hooker.  And if Teri Garr has turned in anything BUT an enjoyable performance, I haven't seen it.
