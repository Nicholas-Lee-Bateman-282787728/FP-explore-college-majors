7858119,4,6303996507,"Plot of the show: Keiichi, a geeky college student, tries to order pizza but ends up ordering the goddess Belldandy. She tells him she'll grant him one wish, but he doesn't believe she's real so he wishes to have a girlfriend like her. Since there is nobody else like her, she stays with him and becomes his girlfriend, and that's when the trouble starts. Urd and Skuld, Belldandy's sisters, show up later on (in following tapes) bringing more trouble for poor Keiichi.
My thoughts: For me, Urd makes the show, it just wouldn't be the same without her... but she doesn't show up until tape 2 I believe. I also like Keiichi, there's something endearingly sweet about him. The manga is better really, and is highly recommended in addition to this OVA. The opening song could be better, and I would have liked to see a longer OVA series. Five episodes just isn't enough. All in all though, a great anime.",1037577600,2,901,4.60248447204969
7858120,5,6303996507,"Oh My Goddess! is one of the best, if shortest, anime series around.  It's cute, sweet, and beautifully animates.

Keiichi is your average college freshman: poor, starving, and picked on by the upperclassmen.  All that changes when he dials for takeout, and mistakenly calls the Goddess Help Hotline.  They send Belldandy, the beautiful and sweet goddess, to grant him a wish.  When Keiichi jokingly wishes to have her as his girlfriend, his wish is granted, and he is now officially with Belldandy.  Unfortunately, Keiichi lives in a men's only dorm, and thus he gets kicked out when he's caught with his new ""girlfriend.""  Keiichi appears to have a fit of bad luck, and it doesn't improve as the video progresses.

Oh My Goddess! is cute and sweet and beautifully animated.  The dubbing is excellent, and the voices all seem totally appropriate, from the high, sweet voice of Belldandy to Otaki's stereotypical California-Blonde-Surfer-Dude-type voice.  It's an excellent adaptation of the manga, and the theme songs are sweet, and beautiful, just like everything else from the series.",1005091200,,1087,5.16
7858121,5,6303996507,"A fabulous anime series, the only drawback is that each tape is too short, and the series is also a little overly short. The character Keichi is adorable in the sense that you can't halp but feel bad for him, because he's so pathetic, but just so darn nice. Belldandy is also one of those characters you just can't dislike, since she's so genuine and friendly.
I like this series, it's cute, funny, and loveable.",1001980800,,412,4.506666666666667
7858122,5,6303996507,"This series is not an amorous explosion of love, a battle of galactic proportions, or an Evangelion psycho trip. It is a story that shows the simplicity of love and presents a touching and beautifully animated story.  There is nothing here to be ashamed about. The story is uplifting and  memorable and the characters are endearing to the last. If you can  appreciate the simple things in life, you're sure to enjoy this anime based  on the comic book.",962236800,,452,4.6835443037974684
7858123,4,6303996507,"I sought this title out for two reasons, one being the fact that I am a big fan of the manga, and two being the fact that ""Oh My Goddess"" is a pretty popular series. After watching it it is easy to see why. Each  episode is incredibly fun to watch, has beautiful artwork, delightful  characters, and more.
In ""Episode 1: Moonlight and Cherry  Blossoms"",Keichi  Morisato lies alone in his desolate, lonely  apartment. Starving, Keichi desperatly trys to find some restaurant that is  still open so he can get some takeout. But he never knew a simple desire  for food could change his life so abruptantly. For Keichi misdials and  finds himself with a different delivery, a wish granting goddess named  Belldandy. But when Keichi jokes about Belldandy living with him, Belldandy  activates his wish and becomes assigned to stay with him forever.
In  ""Episode 2: Midsummer Night's Dream"" Belldandy and Keichi have  been living together pleasantly for five months now. That day, Keichi  checks his mail and finds what he believes to be a pornograhic video,  Entitled ""Sexy sister #2"". He eargerly puts it in his VCR. Low  and behold, Urd, Belldandys sister, jumps out of the T.V. set and persuades  Keichi to seduce Belldandy during Keichi and Belldandys vacation. Keichi  makes attempt after attempt but to no avail; he's not brave enough. And so  Urd decides to drug Keichi. But Urds plan goes from clever to disasterous.  This Episode is my personal favorite; I love the character Urd. She is  generally a pretty attractive person, but she's not at all like Belldandy,  Personalitie-wise. When Urd gets interested in something, it literally  becomes her passion. Urd is very dedicated to spiceing up Belldandy and  Keichi's relationship, which results in some of the funniest moments in the  ""Oh my Goddess"" series. I noticed a little racy behavior due to  the arrival of Urd, however, some of which might be found objectionable to  the parent, but its overall pretty innocent. The climax to this episode  was, in my opinion, quite touching.
In ""Episode 3: Burning Hearts on  the Road"" We are introduced to Skuld (I believe it's pronouced like  School) who is totally against Keichi and Belldandy being together. Skuld  is deeply attached to Belldandy, and wants her to leave Keichi's side and  join her in heaven (or wherever Goddess's live). This particular tale has a  solid plot and, at times, has delightful tension.
In ""Episode 4:  Evergreen Holy Night"", ""Oh My Goddess"" becomes much more  serious. Melodrama haters need not apply. In this episode, troublesome  bugs, which Skuld was meant to elimanate, have arrived on earth. Bug mainly  cause Pandemonium to an almost dangerous level, and the only way to get rid  of them is for all three of our goddess's are to cease interaction with  Keichi (gasp).
""Episode 5: For the Love of Goddess"" This is an  incredibly tounching episode. Belldandy Belldandy has been confined to her  room whenever Keichi is around due to the destructive nature of their  getting too close to each other. Soon she will be forced to leave earth.  Keichi is saving up money and working all kinds of jobs so that he can buy  Belldandy a going-away present: a ring. This Episode is Triumphant as it is  teary-eyed.
Ultimatly, ""Oh My Goddess"" is a charming, above  average comedy/romance. Fan's of ""Ranma 1/2"" or ""Tenchi  muyo!"" with undoubtfully enjoy this anime. Its may not be the most  complex, but it should be praised highly for what it is, a very enjoyable  anime that remains to be one of sweetest love comedy's to date.",960076800,48,3556,4.867892976588629
7858124,5,6303996507,"Please allow me to apologize in advance for the length of this review, I got just a little carried away with my description.
When I finished the Uresei Yatsura manga, (please look it up)I was at a loss.  What could  possibly entertain me after I ran out of Lum?  The answer came when I was  flipping through a catalog of animes.  It said something to the effect that  if Uresei Yatsura is zany, the word for Oh My Goddess is sweet.  The  reference to UY was enough to catch my interest, so I bought volume one of  Oh My Goddess.  The result: an instant favorite!  When a college student  named Kaechi Morisato (sp?)accidentally dials ""The Goddess  HelpLine"" while trying to order food to be delivered, he orders much  more than he bargained for!  The Goddess Belldandy, a kind, attractive,  open minded Goddess grants Kaechi his heart's desire, but the rules say she  can only grant one wish. Kaechi's wish: Since Goddesess don't really exist  and this is most likely a joke, he'll take Belldandy as his wish!  She will  be his girlfriend forever! Belldandy is very pleased to inform Kaechi that  his wish is approved, and thus begins this wonderful adventure! My younger  brother sat down to watch this with me and immediately raved about how well  drawn the characters were.  ""Finally, someone knows how to draw  people!""  He told me. I personally fell in love with the music.  The  characters are more realistic than in other animes, and thus easier to  understand and become attached to. Plus the movie is completely innocent,  with almost no unsuitable scenes!  I say almost because there is one brief  daydream featuring a semi-unclad Belldandy, but unless you're looking for  it, nothing shows. If you are new to anime, or want to interest a friend,  this is the one to begin with.  I would give it more than five stars if I  were able to!",945907200,14,1846,4.641744548286605
7858125,5,6303996507,"This movie was absolutely wondafil.  The music is spectacular, the animation was superb, they plot was splendid!  Very good dubbing job.  A must for any anime fan, or any movie lover at all!",945129600,,190,4.696969696969697
7858126,5,6303996507,"For anyone who loves anime, you have to see or even read the Oh My Goddess Series!  and if you don't know what anime even is, pick this up anyway.  It's a masterpiece!  The English dubbed version was done very nicely.  The  English sub-title is just as good.  It's a shame that there are only five  tapes of the series.  If you miss out, you are going to regret it.",944179200,4,365,4.114285714285714
7858127,5,6303996507,"This has to be one of the most amazing anime I have ever seen.  The animation is beautiful, and the story is captivating. (Not to mention hilarious)  I bought this video recently, and have watched it more than  many other of my anime videos.  I reccomend this to any fans of comedy  anime.",933552000,,289,4.377358490566038
