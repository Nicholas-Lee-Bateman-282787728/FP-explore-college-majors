8609077,1,B0014H2SSU,"The video and audio quality of the dvd are great. But the game is split up over 2 discs with the 1st and 2nd period on one and the 3rd period on the other. While I see it's clearly marked as a two disc set in the description, I never imagined that's how they meant it. If this was for a $10 copy, then fine. But this was $30. It may not seem like a big deal but for that price the game should at least be completely on one disc. At that price, two separate discs is unacceptable.",1436486400,,479,3.8484848484848486
