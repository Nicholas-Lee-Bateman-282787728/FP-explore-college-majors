4375064,5,B004H1ZR5G,"I just got this video from an art supply shop for my son.  I have many books on the subject, but they are all very simplistic and do not go in to the level of detail this DVD went into.  The examples were exactly what I was looking for.  The tricks and techniques for beginners and others alike were simple yet comprehensive.  The progression of steps with associated visuals make this a definite buy for anyone looking to get started in drawing.  My son is 12 and I suspect he will find this very useful.  I expect to be sitting down at a table with him to watch this to pause occasionally to walk him through some examples.  This should be very fun for him as he has recently gotten into diagramming everything.  Very impressive video.  It was a bit cheaper at the art store than it was here on Amazon though, but not by much.  This is definitely worth its weight.",1355961600,4,866,4.290123456790123
4375065,5,B004H1ZR5G,"I have just purchased all of this artist's DVDs and all are FABULOUS!  Get them all -- you won't be disappointed!  The artist's drawing skills and teaching delivery are exceptional.  His lessons, explanation, and voice flow beautifully.  He starts with basic exercises and advances you throughout his DVDs.  All of them are great!  I absolutely love them all!",1340928000,5,359,5.103448275862069

I like it a lot.",1323993600,4,120,4.041666666666667
4375067,5,B004H1ZR5G,This was a good purchase.  I thought the material was presented in a manner that made it easy to follow and interesting. It will definately help you create realistic drawings.,1312502400,8,175,4.833333333333333
4375068,5,B004H1ZR5G,"Every artist needs to know some perspective. Exaggerate it, distort it, whatever; but you cannot ignore it without looking really lame. This excellent video covers what you need to know in a simple and easily understood format. It is basic enough to be appropriate for beginners, yet detailed enough to be quite useful to advanced and knowledgeable artists. Best of all, it reveals about five hundred years worth of artists tips, tricks, and rules of thumb that were once considered proprietary secrets. The technique for accurately transferring measurements is alone worth the price. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to better understand the methods for creating illusionistic space. You will learn something useful, even if you already have a basic knowledge of perspective. Well worth it.",1295740800,19,802,5.2734375

8429259,3,B004H1ZR5G,"I bought this DVD for my middle school students, and while it was informative and showed easy to understand examples, my students were falling asleep.  The instructor seemed ""coached"" and unnatural- and didn't hold their attention.  I found it to be geared more towards adults/people who are seeking additional pointers and who can follow along at a slower pace.  I found myself skipping ahead quite a bit- NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS WHO EXPECT ENTERTAINMENT.",1472515200,2,469,5.226666666666667
8429260,5,B004H1ZR5G,"I've read several books, and watched quite a few videos on drawing in perspective. Books usually only cover the basics, like how to draw a building or some kind of basic structure in perspective. This video, however, blows all of those out of the water. I am amazed at the sheer volume of info he throws at you in this relatively short video. Anything you would need to know about drawing in perspective is covered:

* Basic 1, 2, and 3 point perspectives.
* Figure out how to space evenly spaced objects in perspective. (like telephone poles, etc)
* Figure out how to space unevenly spaced objects in perspective (windows, doors, etc)
* How to draw stairs, shadows, and ellipses (wheels, etc) in perspective
* How to properly place people, furniture, etc. in a scene
* How to draw basically any building or structure in perspective, along with doors, windows, roofs, etc

If you are a comic-book artist, illustrator, or artist, you NEED this video. It is that comprehensive, yet easy to follow. And that good. I never even bother referring to the other materials I have on perspective, anymore. If there was a book that covered this exact same material, that would be awesome, too. Buy this. You won't be sorry.",1418515200,5,1212,4.712264150943396
