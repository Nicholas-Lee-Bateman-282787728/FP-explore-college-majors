8563302,5,B00B6EIU4W,"Amazing documentary of warships in eras gone by. The USS Texas is a true Hero Ship, being the only ship remaining that served in both world wars, and the first ship to launch an aircraft from her deck... Everyone should see this, and get an appreciation of what it meant to fight those wars, fire 14"" guns, or have your life depend on cover from those guns, as you make ground assaults...

This program has interviews with veterans that served aboard the USS Texas, and as we all age, new interviews won't be possible.  First-hand accounts, and authentic (not Hollywood produced) video/audio gives us an accurate picture of the role these valiant ships played in our nation's history.

I heartily recommend this video. I'd love to see it shown in middle schools and high schools around the country.",1480636800,,798,4.768115942028985
