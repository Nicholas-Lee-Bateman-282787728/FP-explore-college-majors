1232084,5,B00000JGOD,"After flipping through the channels the other day, my roommates and I came upon this movie and decided to stay there, well, due in large part to Keri Russel (and the hope that maybe.. just maybe... she didn't sign a no nudity clause). Well, she obviously did sign such a clause, but so what? The movie was excellent. It is so unlike any of those typical teenage movies where everyone looks like they are supermodel in their mid twenties. Even though Keri Russel is very visually pleasing, it was the geeks who made this movie. It reminds me of this book- Youth in Revolt- because it's just so honest. Rent it. Buy it. You'll love it.",974246400,4,633,4.4655172413793105
1232085,3,B00000JGOD,"I hate to bring up such manipulative teen romantic comedies as ""10 things I hate about you"", ""She's all that"", ""Varsity  Blues"", ""Down to you"", ""Boys and Girls"",  ""Loser"", and any other movie starring Freddie Prinze Jr that I  have forgotten, but those films are under the impression that everyone in  High School is a model, everyone drives around in sports cars, everyone  carries a cell phone, and everyone speaks as if just out of Shakespearean  times.  ""8 days a week"", does not.  Our hero is NOT beautiful, in  fact, he is a genuine loser.  Of course Keri Russell is beautiful, but yet  she is not the everyday person, she is the object of the loser's affection.  What I really liked about this movie is it's honesty in proving that nice  guys do finish last.  Even though it was a bit raunchy that doesn't detract  from the movies charm and honesty about life and teenage love.  Even though  this film had only a limited theatrical release and was essentially  straight to video with no big Hollywood models/actors, this proves to be  the most genuinly sweet and honest teen romance out there.",964828800,10,1100,4.664921465968586
1232086,5,B00000JGOD,"I was introduced to this film by a friend whose taste in movies I usually question. This one, however, did much for my respect of him.
This movie was pure hilarity, and amazingly original and the actors, as opposed to  many of Hollywood's teen models, were surprisingly good. Peter (Joshua  Schaefer) is in love with the beautiful and unobtainable Erica (Keri  Russell). At the urging of his hilarious grandfather Nonno (Buck Kartalian)  and against the wishes of his mother, father, and obscenely peurile best  friend (R.D. Robb) he proceeds to wait night and day on her lawn. What  follows is a coming of age adventure with so many eclectic and almost  random twists that there is simply not a dull moment.
Eight Days a Week  is a great movie for teenagers. It's post-graduation summer is hilarious  and raunchy but manages to keep its head above the water instead of relying  on shock value. It is a truly memorable teen comedy. Forget American Pie  and pick up this movie.",959731200,21,976,4.75

1232089,5,B00000JGOD,"I found this on TV one very late night, and despite just having returned home from a 14.5 hour shift at work, this film kept me up for an additional 2 hours. The sheer originality of the idea itself, combined with the on  screen audacity of a bloke who sits under a neighbours window with  ""life as his TV"" was enough for me. This comedy shines.",949276800,2,345,4.212121212121212
1232090,3,B00000JGOD,"like most of the reviewers before me i bought(not rented) this movie only beacuse Keri Russel was in it, but i thought that it would be much better. I mean, its not something completetly unwatchable, but it is nothing really  great either. It's just an ok time passer if there is nothing better to do.  I reccomend fans of Keri Russel check it out because they are the ones that  would like it most......I liked the ending alot though...",948067200,,437,4.506329113924051
1232091,4,B00000JGOD,"I rented this just for the fact that she was in it.  But I have also seen ""The Curve"", and she was not very good in that.  Of course it was a smaller part, so there wasn't much to work with I suppose.  She was  surprisingly good in this movie, and some of it was actually pretty funny.  Her part is not like Felicity though.  Unless you can picture her riding in  a beefed-up Camaro.  She still has a sweet side to her though.  So if you  are at all curious about the flic, I recommend you rent it.",934502400,,498,3.9393939393939394
1232102,5,B00000JGOD,"This was one of those movies I caught by happenstance on TNT one late night more than a decade back and instantly fell in love with. It tells an unconventional love story in an unconventional manner in such a wonderful, endearing manner. Plus you get to state at Keri Russell rocking bikinis and the mom from Boy Meets World in little more than a bra. It's good times to be had for all.",1441584000,,386,4.301369863013699
1232103,5,B00000JGOD,I found this movie by flipping channels a few years back and instantly LOVED it. I haven't laughed out loud in a while at a movie and I did at this one. It's a very lighthearted tale with characters that I felt were very easy to identify with.,1435190400,,243,4.083333333333333
1232104,5,B00000JGOD,"I have been watching the price of this movie for the past several months, it is a great movie but I don't think it is worth the 20 to 30 dollars it goes for. It is only a dvd not a bluray. I feel sorry for the people that have over payed for a movie that should be sailing for only 7.50 at most.",1433116800,,295,3.625

1232111,3,B00000JGOD,"To put it bluntly, a classic peace of 90's filmaking, they don't make movies like this anymore. I wish they did, but they dont, this movie is not quite as popular or well known as other big 90's highschool flicks such as American Pie and Cant hardly wait. But it is a must see. Once the credits start rolling, you should have a smile on your face. Its that kind of movie.",1332720000,,371,4.166666666666667

1232114,4,B00000JGOD,"First, I have to tell you I got this movie because I'm a fan of Keri Russell.  In this movie she is pretty, sexy and flirty.  The movie delivered on all the eye candy I was expecting. I have to give credit to the director for getting her to run through the sprinkler in the thin white shirt.  It instantly became see-through and the slow motion was awesome!  Thanks for that!  There are some other really good eye candy scenes.  As far as the story, it's pretty funny at times. It's not your typical shallow teen movie.

I highly recommend this movie to fans of Keri Russell and also to fans of teenager movies.

Four stars!",1239148800,,624,4.318965517241379
1232115,3,B00000JGOD,"The Bottom Line:

Though it has earned a bit of a cult that might argue otherwise, Eight Days a Week is a fairly generic raunchy teen comedy--not especially good or interesting, it was shelved and forgotten for a reason.",1230768000,,220,4.641025641025641
1232116,5,B00000JGOD,"If you ever had a hopeless crush or been placed in ""the friend zone"" this is must-see.  Joshua Schaefer is charming, witty, and adorable.  You're rooting for him from the very beginning.  Keri Russell is perfect as the dream girl.  R.D. Robb plays the perverted wingman to Schaefer and provides his fair share of laughs.
Peter (Schaefer) has been in love with Erica (Russell) for all the years they've lived across the street from each other.  Finally, the summer before they're both heading to different colleges he decides to camp out on her front lawn to prove his love for her and declares that he will stay there until she returns the sentiment.
This movie has great observational humor.  It's funny and relatable.  I saw it shortly after it first came out and tried for ages to find the DVD.  Now that you've found it on Amazon, you should buy it.  It's definitely worth owning.",1197936000,,884,4.651612903225806

1232118,1,B00000JGOD,"This movie is really awful. It ""might"" be funny if the viewer is a low IQ teen-ager but for the average movie-goer it is just plain bad.

The movie is billed as a romantic comedy and I suppose it is but the humor is not funny and the romance is not romantic.

The lead character sleeps on the sidewalk outside the house of the object of his affection. His parents are nutty and his neighbors are nutty. None of the characters are believable and the dialogue is gibberish.",1175558400,,471,4.340909090909091
1232119,5,B00000JGOD,"i used to work at a used movie store and i would see this video every day for about a year before i finally checked it out.

in the 5 years since i originally bought it on vhs (and more recently on dvd!!!) i have watched it at least 20 times.

for me, it gets funnier every time.

this movie would never be confused w/an oscar award winning movie, but it's one of the most true-to-life comedies about sex that i've ever seen....definently the funniest.

this is not a goofy comedy like 'american pie',nor does it mesh in with a lot of the stereotypical movies that are a dime a dozen the last few years. there are no 'stifler' type characters in this movie.

this is just about a kid who just graduated high school and has been in love w/his neighbor since he first saw her. she's moving away to go to college and he gets advice from his grandfather to try to win her over.

this is one of the greatest observational movies that you'll never hear about. there's not too much in the way of break-through acting, but it is a classic to me.

recommended to anyone who likes to laugh and who has an open mind to what they think movies should be.",1173916800,2,1141,4.2304147465437785
1232120,5,B00000JGOD,"I watched the middle to end of this movie on Comedy Central and after never seeing the start of it I knew I had to buy it. I must say I love it, it's so raw and probably more accurate about being a teenager and that last summer before you leave. I love how this movie wasn't afraid to say anything. That's refreshing.",1156809600,4,317,4.0476190476190474
1232121,5,B00000JGOD,"Thank you Keri Russell for making this movie! One day you will be very glad you made this movie because it captures you at your most beautiful and sensual, and you will be thusly immortalized. Physical beauty is elusive and enigmatic for those who are not blessed with it, and all too ephemeral for those who are. I am certain you will someday be very thankful because it is rare for an actress to have the opportunity to showcase her looks and talent at her peak, yet this film does just that. Believe me that many of us value this tremendously.

The movie itself is pretty good and the transfer is clean. Special features are few, though it has the best one of all - Keri Russell. That's all we need, however, and she is the only reason I give this five stars.",1148256000,4,762,4.328671328671328
1232122,3,B00000JGOD,"I caught this movie on late night cable one weekend. I was suffering from a prolonged allergy attack that had knocked me on my @$$ and made me wish that someone would put me out of my misery. Usually, when I'm sick like this, I'll watch stuff on T.V. that I normally would pass on since my mind is somewhere else. While flipping through the movie channels I saw that a movie starring the extremely cute Keri Russell (best known as T.V.'s Felicity) called Eight Days a Week was coming on, that it was Rated-R and contained strong sexual content. Curious to see what Ms. Russell looked like minus most of her clothes (though she doesn't go all the way), I proceeded to watch the film expecting a disaster/guilty pleasure.

To my surprise, this movie turned out to be a decent little teen-romantic-comedy. The acting is solid, there were some genuinely funny moments, the main character who camps out on Keri's lawn reminded me sometimes of Woody Allen as a teenager and Ms. Russell was extremely beautiful and sweet. (On the completely shallow and superficial front, Keri Russell doesn't actually do any nudity, though she comes frustratingly close at numerous occasions.)

The basic plot involves Peter (Joshua Schaefer), a nerdy teen who has a huge crush on the gorgeous Erica (Keri Russell) who lives across the street. He tries to get her attention but she's wrapped up in a relationship with a stereotypical jock. Peter than decides after getting advice from his Grandfather to camp out on her lawn (all day and night) and not leaving until she lets him profess his admiration for her and hopefully starts going out with him.

That's essentially the whole plot. There are various characters that weave in and out of the movie. In addition to Peter's grandpa, he has a best friend who is extremely oversexed and will do anything to get laid. Erica's parents are extremely devout Christians and are very strict with her. There's a middle-aged woman with whom Peter's friend has a crush on. One of the neighbors also is carrying mysterious trash bags out to his car and Peter and his friend start thinking that the guy might have killed somebody and is disposing of the body (of course they're very wrong.)

The movie features some pretty insightful viewpoints on teen relationships and society in general. I particularly liked Peter's viewpoints on almost everyone who lives near him and how peculiar their behavior sometimes was. On the downside, I found his best friend to be somewhat annoying and his attempts at being funny somewhat forced. He's the apparent goofy sidekick/comic relief of the movie, and unfortunately, he ground the movie to a halt whenever he was on screen. There's also a couple of pointless subplots involving people in his neighborhood that just come across as an effort to pad out the movie's running time.

But most people will probably check out this movie specifically for (a pre-Felicity) Keri Russell. She really did a great acting job and made her character genuinely sweet. Once she makes her entrance in the movie, it's not any mystery as to why Peter is madly in love with her.

Anyone who is a fan of her will want to check out this movie ASAP. The opening scene, for instance, has her frolicking in a water sprinkler wearing a wet t-shirt and extremely tight shorts. There's another in which she's in a very tight bikini and the camera slowly pans over her entire body in explicit detail. She does numerous revealing shots (including a couple of surprising crotch shots) in tight dresses and underwear, but unfortunately, no nudity. But it's refreshing that the writer/director actually gave her character some depth and didn't treat her completely as eye candy (though she excels in that department).

While some of the movie gets quite raunchy at times, it is actually surprisingly restrained at times and doesn't come close to approaching American Pie gross-out territory.

While not anything memorable or spectacular, Eight Days of Week does have its moments and isn't a complete waste of time if you happen to run across it on cable or your local video store. It's a great showcase for the lovely and talented Keri Russell and is much better than a lot of similar teen romantic comedies. I give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.

Eights Days a Week is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity and language.",1130889600,10,4351,4.80614973262032
