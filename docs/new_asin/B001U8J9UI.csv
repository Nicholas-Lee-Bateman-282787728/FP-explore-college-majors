8343145,5,B001U8J9UI,"In 1965 Alfredo B. Crevenna directed AVENTURA EN EL CENTRO DE LA TIERRA, with recycled footage from other films, with a great cast (Javier Sols, Columba Domnguez) but with no good results.
Everything start with a group of tourists visiting the Cacahuamilpa Caves, two of them, a little too ''in love'' decide to stay behind to do a little kissy-touchy and is when the monster strikes. Killing the man and taking the woman with him.
Now, a group of scientists so they can venture inside the caves all the way to the bottom, find that girl and bring her out. Of course that the expedition suffers some loss, but the effort is good, specially when Mxico was behind in the monster movie genre that flourished around the world in the 50s.

Two years later, Mr Crevenna directed GIGANTES PLANETARIOS, where Daniel Wolf (Guillermo Murray), scientist with a brand new rocket ship and a girlfriend/secretary (Gabriela Roel) is sent to 'the planet of the eternal night' to fight the guy who has threatened earth. He supposed to go alone, but his assistant sneaks in the ship somehow, along with other two guys (Rogelio Guerra/Ferrusquilla (taquito), running away from the law, so, with no previous preparation, three more people go to outer space without problem.
Jose Galvez, ruler of the planet, tries to use his necroluminic ray to kill all life on earth (and like in any other movie, the african is the first to die).
Thanks to the Mr. Wolf and the stowaways good triumphs over evil and earth don't gets destroyed. They promise the natives to come back some other time, which is not true since this same ship and tripulation end up going to

EL PLANETA DE LAS MUJERES INVASORAS (1967)
In the same year so the ship and sets didn't go to waste, Mr Crevenna sent the crew to the planet of the 'eternal shining sun'. Such creativity!
You had to wear glasses in there and all the inhabitants were women. They had kidnapped some earthlings and now they had to be rescued. Lorena Velazquez was both the evil and the good witch, I mean, queen. The cutest girls (Elizabeth Campbell, Maura Monti), were sent to earth to get more information and the less cute ones (Monica Miguel, Lucia Guilmain), stayed serving the queen.
What these women wanted from us were our lungs, so they could go everywhere where they could breath oxygen.

You're not going to believe this, but the ship the women use to take hostages to their planet is one from a State Fair, since people were already in it. I guess that toy ship could stand the hardship of space travel and everything!
Don't miss LA NAVE DE LOS MONSTRUOS (from Rogelio A. Gonzlez), another jewel...",1316908800,3,2627,4.681818181818182
