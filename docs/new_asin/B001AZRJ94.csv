8450997,3,B001AZRJ94,A little disappointed as dvd only lasts 38 minutes and Iam sure that Roger Miller could have a documentary lasting 120 minutes.,1264896000,5,127,4.818181818181818
8450998,2,B001AZRJ94,"I was looking forward to getting this DVD however it is unfortunately the same DVD you get for free with a recent Greatest Hits ""King of the Road"" CD/DVD release that you can buy for $5. I wish I knew this before ordering it.

There is next to no Roger Miller footage on here, it's mostly a standard documentary with Roger's name inserted once in a while. I'm guessing this company did a blanket country music documentary and uses 99% of the same footage for a wide variety of artists.

If you are interested in knowing more about Roger Miller, be sure to check out the book ""Ain't Got No Cigarettes - Memories of Music Legend Roger Miller"" available here on Amazon.

Hopefully someday someone will release some of the amazing footage that is available out there from his TV show and many TV appearances.",1223942400,12,804,4.531034482758621
