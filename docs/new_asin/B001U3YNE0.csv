8462480,5,B001U3YNE0,"The Melvins were never known for doing things traditionally and this DVD is a perfect example of that.  Even by 1991's standards this isn't a well filmed, high budget, recording as far as audio and video goes but this is exactly what a Melvins show from 1991 should be.  Raw, loud, and chaotic as hell!

Some Highlights Include
-Joe punching a fan during the first song
-Joe mysteriously loses his bass and Buzz gives him a disappointed look
-The non stop energy of the crowd
-Buzz drooling over his guitar
-The awkward close up of Dale's speedo
-The cameraman only being able to film Buzz's shoes during most of Oven because of the crowd

This is one of my favorite dvds from a band and I highly recommended it.  Just make sure you are familiar with the Ozma, Bullhead, and Eggnog records first.",1266883200,,796,4.538461538461538
