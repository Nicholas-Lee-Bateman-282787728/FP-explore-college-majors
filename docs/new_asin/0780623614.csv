34340,5,0780623614,"Excellent rendition of the Dracula story. Follows the original Nosferatu (1922) with the added biting humor. The slapstick is well anticipated, but the corny jokes are fairly original and will catch you off guard.

Instead of Arty Johnson for Renfield they used Peter MacNicol which looks more like the original Renfield but actually more convincing. Lysette Anthony shows what is most British about her as Lucy. Actually, there is not mismatched actor to character.

The ending credits show the peoples faces with the parts they play.

I leave you with these thoughts:
Vampire - Lucy lying in her coffin.
Harker: My God now shes dead!
Van Helsing: No, shes not.
Harker: Shes alive?
Van Helsing: She is Nosferatu.
Harker: shes Italian?",1505347200,,735,5.0578512396694215

34367,4,0780623614,"DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT lives (lurks) in the shadows of the superior YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, so it tends to get summarily dismissed as one of Mel Brooks lesser comedies.  But if it lacks the high hilarity of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, it can stand on its own as an amusing and consistently inventive parody, best enjoyed by film buffs who will appreciate (and delight in) the references to all of the Dracula movies that are lovingly satirized here.
Like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT presents set pieces that are played straight.  These scenes would not be out of place in legitimate vampire movies.  Yet this time, the contrast may seem off-balance to some viewers, as there are few truly gut-busting comedic moments.  Nevertheless, if you're a Brooks fan, Mel and his merry band of maniacs supply an abundance of chuckles.",1501200000,,836,4.95

34409,2,0780623614,"Here's the thing; I'm really a big Mel Brooks fan but this film doesn't do it.  I'm sure a few hundred other learned and astute people have pointed out the differences between this movie and Young Frankenstein.  Let me add my brief and dumbed-down critique in that line.  Young Frankenstein was about 25% straight story and 75% great gags; Dead and Loving It is about 75% straight story (why???) and 25% gags.  Wonderful sets, great photography, straight story . . . and jokes that are few and far between.  Is it the absence of Gene Wilder that tells here?
  There are some very funny bits.  Some.  And that's the issue/problem.  No real spoiler here but one of the strongest moments (90 seconds with no cut!) is the stake through the heart bit done in pseudo-Monty Python style.  Another is the problems that can develop when you've accidently hypnotized two people at the same time.
  Maybe I'd go 2 1/2 stars.  For me it's the interminable straight story that dogs this film down.  (As if I could do better . . . )",1498953600,,1018,4.516483516483516

Leslie Nielsen, Harvey Korman, Peter MacNicol,  Mel Brooks and all of the other stars in this movie make it a must see. Especially if you like Brooks' comedic flare in movies. MacNicol is incredible as Renfro, Dracula's assistant. The simply, yet funny scenes with Nielsen attempting to lure Lucy from her garlic protected room one that will have you holding your belly!

He did Blazing Saddles which in today's PC world should be burned but is still shown with some bleeps. He does the Jewish shtick with the getting the last word. He stakes out every ploy, vampire lore and rumor and just cracks the audience up! I love the way his faithful wife gets a cameo and Anne Bancroft is always a hoot! I love the stake the babe scene where gallons of blood shoot our over the hero. IMDB sais that he did not know that would happen so his reactions on camera were true! He was shocked and handing him a hanky to clean up, Id have staked Van Helsing next!! I love the classic vampire movies and this one should be up there with Hammer Films and Bela Lugosi!

34826,3,0780623614,"While not the most brilliant film by any stretch of the imagination, director Mel Brooks successfully sends up Universal Studios' adaptation of the Brahm Stoker's classic horror tale ""Dracula."" While lacking in the satirical soul of some of Brooks' previous entries (""Blazing Saddles"", ""Silent Movie""), this film revels in the quick witted verbal sparring and cartoonish slapstick gags Brooks is also known for (""Young Frankenstein"", ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"").

Leslie Nielson plays the title role with the straight wit of his Frank Drebon character from the ""Police Squad"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series, injected with the bombastic flair required of a character who wears lavish capes and turns into bats. It is a treat to see Nielson stretch out a little from the purely comedic roles that established his contemporary career, and play a character with equal parts charm and menace. Those who only know his work from ""The Naked Gun"" are sorely missing out on the wide range of performances Nielson has given in films like ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Poseiden Adventure"".
Likewise, most who watch this movie will not recognize Peter MacNicol as the bumbling thrall, Thomas Renfield. MacNicol is the slapstick backbone of this film, with his character at the epicenter of most of its physical gags. MacNicol's exaggerated performance is such a far cry from his roles in ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Ally McBeal"", that you will swear it's not the same man. Other notable performances include Amy Yasbeck as the melodramatic damsel in distress (Mina Seward), Steven Weber as the stereotypically affected romantic lead (Jonathan harker), and Harvey Korman as the pretentious and stuffy Englishman (Dr. Seward). Mel Brooks drives the action of the movie by playing Abraham Van Helsing as the cunning foil to Nielson's Dracula.

Most of the performances by the supporting cast send-up the stuffy, pretentious culture of Victorian Enlgand, but since the original Dracula (and much of Gothic Romanticism in general) already satirized that point in history, it feels overblown to the point of melodrama.  However this isn't such a bad thing, since most of Mel Brooks' films are goofy by nature.  If you can surrender yourself to a film that is more absurd that most of others by Brooks, you may find yourself with a new Halloween favorite. At the very least, it's better than ""Ernest Scared Stupid.""",1415404800,,2382,5.131443298969073

Leslie Nielsen is decent but not great as Dracula mainly because he is simply too old to play Dracula. Mel brooks and harvey Korman are the best of the supporting actors because they underplay their roles and are able to come off with some funny moments. Overall, the film pushes the envelope a bit but it still manages to entertain the viewer.

Peter MacNichol perfectly captures the insane laugh from Renfield's role in the Bela Lugosi version.

Gosh, Leslie Nielsen is just so wonderful in this piece.  He's brilliant everywhere, but here he has been coached perfectly to fake an Eastern European accent, and he does it just slightly understated--sheer genius.

I think I enjoyed it more this time. I wouldn't call it a positive match for Young Frankenstein, which I'll always consider Brooks' masterpiece but it's good, enjoyable fare. Peter Macnichol's Renfield performance (especially the laugh) could rival the original. Some of the dialogue is taken straight from the 1931 Dracula word-for-word. Perhaps even some of the scenery, too. Though most of the jokes are telegraphed so far ahead, you can quote them before they happen, they're still amusing.  All in all, it's a good Halloween movie, not too gory, and lighthearted enough not to cause nightmares. Indigestion perhaps, but no bad dreams.",1392854400,,818,5.059259259259259

This effort is aided by Mel Brooks, Harvey Korman, and a superlative support cast, and just when you think a victim of Dracula is doomed, the unexpected and the unconscious intervenes to cause hilarity. While this is not a great movie, especially if you like horror stories, this does have its tense moments, but these usually are offset by some pratfall or a misconstruction of what has been said. Naturally, Nielsen as Dracula seems perennially oblivious of just what is going on around him, but this is nothing when compared to his trusty assistant.

34988,4,0780623614,"This is a good spoof of the Dracula films, both the original 1931 version with Bela Lugosi, and the Hammer films from the 1950's.

In some ways, Mel Brooks does a better job translating Bram Stoker's novel to the screen than the other films.  You actually understand who Renfield is, why Dracula ends up in England, and the relationship between Dr. Seward, Harker, Lucy, Mina and Van Helsing.

While good, and worth watching, it falls short of the comic genius Brooks displayed in ""Blazing Saddles"", ""High Anxiety"" and (in my opinion) his masterpiece genre spoof, ""Young Frankenstein"".

Still, it's a good spoof.  I'd pair it with the 1958 Hammer Films version of ""Dracula"" for a fun double feature with family and friends.  Show the Hammer film first, break for pizza, and the show the Mel Brooks version for a fun Halloween party.",1388880000,2,832,4.823943661971831
34989,5,0780623614,"I actually own the Region 2 version of this movie, but as the contents of the case are the same, I'll write here what I think about this, one of the latest Mel Brooks creations, and here's what I think in one word: fabulous.
Everything about this one (and I've seen several Mel Brooks movies in my life up until now) is perfect: the casting, the costumes, the period atmosphere, the witty or sarcastic lines, the 'scary'-like feeling that doesn't take itself too seriously.
Not everyone is going to want to sit and watch this movie, since this is not a new one and there are always those who'll never give a change to a movie made before 2010 - but, for the sake of those who believe a good movie stays a good movie even after almost twenty years of age - than this is the one for you - and if you do sit and watch, prepare yourself for some good laughs and a very pleasant evening in the company of the great late Leslie Nielsen, the fool that becomes his loyal - but clumsy - servant, played by Peter MacNicol, and characters of the fair ladies Lucy and Mina played by Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony, Harvey Korman as Doctor Seward (the girls' father), Mina's fianc played by Steven Webber and an hilarious acting of Profer Van Helsing by Mel Brooks himself, doing what I believe is his last cinematic role before he passed away.
As I never bothered to read Bram Stoker's novel in my life, nor watched any other Dracula movie before, I cannot really make comparisons, which is absolutely o.k. with me, because I find this movie, based on these but build as a crazy parody, entertaining enough to not even consider watching or reading the above-mentioned - although I have watched more than once the serious but equally wonderful movie 'Interview With The Vampire' - from which I learned there is another way of killing a Vampire or at least making it extremely weak (recommended as well to watch for seeing what I'm hinting at here).
I simply adore everything about this production, the background music, the black humor, Leslie Nielsen's expressions according to the scenes he's participating in... Simply put, there's nothing bad about this movie and if you like your movies fit for Halloween but without being too disgusting, then this is the right choice to pop in into your DVD player, and despite its age, believe me, it's never really gets old.
P.S. if after this movie you'll want your almost every dish to contain garlic, this is a perfectly normal reaction under the influence of Van Helsing's fight against those who are called 'the children of the night'.
Enjoy the tale and the daymare as well... The low price of it and the welcome addition to your growing collection.",1388793600,,2685,4.595833333333333

Mel sticks a little too closely to the Francis Ford Coppola version of Dracula which came out three years earlier. If Mr. Brooks gave it the usual comedic treatment he had so much success with in his other films, this one had potential. Dracula could have come  back during the 1967 summer of love and start tripping on the LSD and other drugs in the hippie chicks blood. A tripping Leslie Nielson as Dracula is something Mel could have done great things with. He could have taken many approaches and infused it with his comedic prowess. As it turned out...

Amy Yasbeck & Steven Weber are also hilarious in this.  This is one of those movies that you have to watch more then once to catch what you missed while you were laughing, and if you are a horror movie buff like I am (not only mainstream flicks, but B & C movies as well) you will REALLY appreciate all of the little nods to SO many different flicks & characters.  Mel Brooks just seems to keep getting funnier with age!!  So sad we lost our sweet, lovable and crazy funny Leslie Nielsen as well as Harvey Korman.....they are TRULY missed!!  Worth the watch......",1383350400,,702,4.576

35103,5,0780623614,"I'm not one for long-winded movie reviews, so I'll keep this short. I found ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" to be a delightfully ribald comedy romp which lovingly and irreverently lampoons many of the previous Dracula films -- everything from the Bela Lugosi classic all the way through to Gary Oldman's take on Vlad the Impaler in 1992. Leslie Nielsen is always a joy to watch, but it is Peter MacNicol as Renfield who steals the show with his spot-on accurate 1930's-era speak and manic bug-devouring antics, a more than worthy successor to Dwight Frye's performance in the 1932 Dracula film. It is also a damn fine companion to Brooks' other genre film, ""Young Frankenstein"" which remains one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. Brooks humor is Brooks humor, and I make no apologies about it. You either love it or hate it or, like me, sometimes both at the same time (""History of the World, Part I"" anyone?) I leave you with the profound words of Harvey Korman, ""Yes! We have Nosferatu! We have Nosferatu today!""",1371686400,,1019,4.666666666666667

35128,3,0780623614,The movie is a parody of Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula film.  This helps explain the big white wig Leslie Nielsen wears in the film.  The gags are good and the jokes fly in and out at a good pace.  It is not up to the standard of Young Frankenstein but better than Men In Tights.  The supporting actors are fine.  The cinematography and sets are not up to the standard set in Young Frankenstein.  This gives the film more of a TV movie of the week feel rather than a big screen production.,1370736000,,495,4.212765957446808

I grew up watching Mel Brooks's humor dating back to 'The Show of Shows' (oops...dating myself), 'The 2000 Year Old Man' with Carl Reiner, innumerable interviews back in the 60's & 70's & ALL his movies. Favorite movie is 'The History of the World, Part 1'. When I heard he had made a musical of 'The Producers', I couldn't wait & I was never disappointed once in the 3 times I saw it.

His role was a serious one; I guess to be different.  Brooks had a few regulars in character roles.  A funny touch that Brooks did is when the Count turns into a bat, it has the face of Neilson.

And they do a great job.  To be honest, most of the film made me chuckle with only a few hard, out right, laughing aloud moments.  Still, the special effects, when used, are great and the settings, costumes, and music are all done well, with a lot of skill and LOVE.  You can tell they enjoyed making this film while at the same time being serious and, I would say, even respectable towards the source, the original movie of Dracula.  If you have to pick between a Twilight movie or this one - get this one.  A PG-13, with some gore, it is a perfect 90 minute film for a pizza night.

35253,5,0780623614,"At the time of its release, Brooks's ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" seemed but an echo of the classics from his glory years (or maybe we were fatigued by the formula by that time), but twenty years later, the film holds up as a strong entry in the canon. Shot in the lush palette of a classic Hammer film (whereas Young Frankenstein emulated Universal's vintage black and white), and featuring the talents of the dearly missed Harvey Korman and Leslie Nielsen, the film rises to new heights upon a fresh revisit. The set-ups and pay-offs are trademark Brooks. Korman, Nielsen, and Brooks, himself, (the comedic elder statesmen here) flow perfectly with the young blood, principally Steven Weber and Peter MacNicol, who've got the chops to make Brooks' scenes work. And the scenes DO work: The arrival of Renfield at Castle Dracula, The bug-eating scene at the sanitarium, the impaling scene at the crypt - all to hilarious results - at once evoking classic monster moments while surprising us with comedic twists. Even cornball punchlines - those deliberate eye-rollers (""I was having a DAY-mare!"") - ring true to the Brooks formula. In short, we see Brooks doing Brooks - and doing it WELL. No, we're not treated to the seventies stable of Brooks players (Wilder, Kahn, Feldman, etc.), but this ensemble is just right for the task at hand (by the way, look for the late Anne Bancroft's brilliant cameo). Time has been kind to this movie. With the distance of years, and constrasted with today's dreck, ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" is Brooks in fine form, a genuine monster parody classic, and highly recommended.",1351209600,,1613,4.890510948905109

The result feels rather like a middling ""Your Show of Shows"" sketch stretched to about eighty minutes.  Leslie Nielsen is miscast in the title role (which really cries out for a Sid Caesar), and only Harvey Korman and Brooks himself seem to understand how this material should be played.

35263,2,0780623614,Dracula - Dead and Loving It is a 1995 movie starring Leslie Nielsen as Dracula and Mel Brooks as Van Helsing. One would think that such a comedic duo would create an amazing comedic satire but the end result is quite mediocre. Some of the jokes are quite funny but on the whole it feels very much so so. Nielsen plays on autopilot and Brooks has seen better days. The costumes look on the cheap and even though it is only about 90 minutes it feels like an overly long movie. Not a terrible film but a very average one. I would like to give a 2+ but since I can not I give it a 2 out of 5. Not recommended. 2/5.,1337385600,,611,3.975609756097561
35264,3,0780623614,"Pretty good, but not Mel Brooks' best ever: that's still ""Blazing Saddles."" And it's not even his best parody: that's still ""Young Frankenstein.""

Leslie Nielsen plays Count Dracula and Mel Brooks plays Professor Van Helsing. I didn't recognize the names of any of the rest of the cast. The plot line sticks surprisingly close to the original book, which is not the usual thing for a satire or a comedy made from a serious book. Of course, much detail is dispensed with, as it always is in converting a book to a movie.

Still, there are some very funny parts. And there are parts which are clever, if not exactly funny in the usual Mel Brooks way. For example, to prove that Dracula is a vampire, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward set up a fancy ball to which they invite the count. When he starts to dance with Mina, Dr. Seward's daughter, they uncover a huge mirror and observe that while Mina shows in the mirror, Dracula does not. Dracula is caught up in the dance, and does not notice the mirror. He lifts Mina over his head, spins her around, and generally does a great many things she couldn't possibly do on her own. Yet of course in the mirror she is dancing alone, even when high in the air. It was fun, but the segment went on too long, well after we all got the point.

Several elements seem to have no other purpose but to be ridiculous, which I suppose is consistent with Mel Brooks' style. One is the huge pompadour wig Dracula wears, and seems to treat it like a hat to take off whenever he chooses. Indeed, the second time he does this, he refers to it as his hat. Also he and Van Helsing talk in some ancient language, and act like schoolboys in insisting on having the last word. But since these words are never translated, it seems to have very little point indeed.

I suppose there is enough here to recommend it, especially if you get a bargain.",1336694400,,1861,4.369942196531792
35265,4,0780623614,"I must say, I am a big Mel Brooks and Leslie Neilson fan. The two together, make a very funny spoof. It seems to parody the Bram Stoker's Draula, that came out about that time. Mel's style of One Liner comedy and Neilson's screw ball comedy were made for each other.

35270,4,0780623614,"""Dracula Dead and Loving It"" is a decent little horror comedy.  It has likable stars like Harvey Korman and Peter McNichol, atmospheric sets, with some dated humor thrown in.  The only problem I had is the incredibly uneven tone of the film.  At times the movie plays like a straight horror film interspersed with some comedic scenes.  From the moment that Lucy dies till she returns from the dead, the movie plays very seriously with no humor.  Then a funny scene or line is abruptly thrown, giving the film an odd quality.

And it wouldn't be the same if Harvey Korman wasn't in it. Just having Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman together in the same movie will always result in totall comedy!

  Just like the way Mel used Igor as comical in Young Frankentstein, he made Renfield comical as well.

""Dracula...Dead and Loving It"" is a terrific return to form for Brooks.  He doesn't reach the heights that he did with his earlier horror spoof but it'll do.  What separates Brooks from his imitators is that he has an affinity for the films he's sending up and not making fun of them.  You want to revisit these films after viewing Brooks' parodies.  Brooks assembles a terrific cast here led by Leslie Nielsen.  Nielsen was probably a septugenarian at the time but he exudes a sexy comic presence.

Real estate agent Renfield (Peter MacNicol) comes to deepest Transylvania to sell Carfax Abbey to Count Dracula (Leslie Nielson). However, after Renfield has a weird experience with some seductive women (""WRONG ME! WRONG MY BRAINS OUT!""), Count Dracula turns him into a gibbering bug-eating loon.

And soon after the Count arrives in England, the seductive Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony) starts suffering from blood loss, which is apparently connected to two tiny marks on her throat. Dr. Seward (Harvey Korman) calls upon the renowned Dr. Van Helsing (Brooks), who decides that Lucy has been bitten by a vampire... just in time for her to drop dead.

Sadly, this isn't the end of the affair, as Lucy has returned from the grave as one of the undead, and Count Dracula has turned his sights on her friend Mina Murray (Amy Yasbeck). The only way to save her is for Van Helsing, Seward and her dim-witted fiancee Jonathan Harker (Steven Weber) to set up an elaborate trap for the vampire...

Let's see -- we've got bat poop, ""breasts"" hair, independently moving shadows, autopsies, garlic, tangos, horny vampire women, hypnosis malfunctions, daymares, insect-eating, and the occasional geyser of blood. While ""Dracula - Dead and Loving It"" is actually pretty faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel, the main point of the movie is to be as funny as possible.

The beginning is a little dumb for a Brooks movie, particularly during the slipping-on-poop-and-falling-downstairs gag. Come on, Mel, you're better than that! But after Dracula leaves for England, the humor becomes classic Brooks stuff -- gags (the ""we have Nosferatu today!"" joke), physical comedy (Dracula arises from the coffin... and whacks his head on a chandelier), and funny dialogue (""You will be my bride throughout eternity. We'll share the endless passion of immortal love!"" ""Oh I can't wait!"" ""NOT YOU!"").

And there are plenty of pokes at Victorian mores (""Let me show you the deep, raw passion of unbridled sexual frenzy!"" ""But Lucy... I'm British!""). Man, this stuff is funny -- and the hilariously ironic ending is perfect.

As for the acting, it's as good as you'd expect -- Leslie Nielson is hilarious as the long-suffering bloodsucker who has to deal with some really dumb people, and Brooks is excellent as the vaguely competent Dr. Van Helsing. There are also some hilarious performances by Weber as the repressed Jonathan, Korman as the enemy-happy Dr. Seward, and MacNicol doing his best impression of Dwight Frye (""Master, master... I mean, mister mister!"").

""Dracula - Dead and Loving It"" is not quite AS funny as it could have been, but after a shaky start it's full of vampiric laughs and spoofery. Ignore ""Vampires Suck,"" and enjoy this instead.",1283385600,,3528,5.5427509293680295

All the characters are superbly parodied in this version of Dracula. The insect- eating Renfield character (brilliantly played by Peter MacNicol) is hilarious as Dracula's minion. And Steven Weber nicely portrays the sexually repressed and prim Jonathan. Leslie Nielson, Mel Brooks, and Harvey Korman are equally great in their roles and the cameo by Ann Bancroft is priceless.

35317,5,0780623614,"Dead and Loving It is a masterpiece, with pivotal acting that would have made any hollywood agent salivate. The scene in the anatomy college class is fantastic and hilarious, and well, let's just say the bedroom scene with the two draculaen brides attacking Renfield at the Transylvanian castle made a rise in my Levi's. Peter MacNicol in the role of Renfield is an absolute riot when you realize he's played other roles such as in Numb3rs, 24, and Boston Legal. Steven Weber is perfect as the victorian prude English twit who accompanies the film as Harvey Korman's assistant at the asylum. Harvey Korman is over the top doing a wonderful job in his role, and of course Mel Brooks is outstanding - especially the competitive dialogue with Leslie Nielson trying to get in the last word. Leslie Nielson should have received multiple awards for his acting, and I can't imagine anybody else being able to be so ideal for that role. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are exceptionally fitted in their roles as English upper crust elite women who have no idea they are so appetizingly stunning. The story unfolds with smooth delivery, hilarious beyond my expectations, giving me every wonderful emotion and enrapturing eyefuls of great scenery, great architecture, attention to detail in faithfulness to Dracula story telling, and yet I nearly ended up on the floor a dozen times laughing hysterically. This is a wonderful addition to anybody's comedy collection, and even fits as a keeper for Dracula fans.

The gags in this are so broad, so old, that you tire of it immediately.  It's nothing like the genius that was ""Young Frankenstein.""

Brooks' problem is that he can't be allowed to work alone.  He has to have someone to contain him, someone like Gene Wilder did with ""YF.""

Otherwise he will go total Borsh Belt and with it lose an audience.

35348,4,0780623614,"When I first heard that Mel Brooks was working on a ""companion piece"" to his classic horror spoof ""Young Frankenstein"", I was elated. At the same time, there was a voice in my head saying, ""Well, given his recent track record, reserve your enthusiasm until the movie comes out"". The result? ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" is pretty much like his later comedies: It has glimmers of the old Brooks comic madness (and genius), but it just fails to be a great film all the way through, as compared to his ultimate Western spoof, ""Blazing Saddles"". On the other hand, DDALI is actually better than most comedies attempting to spoof movie genres.
As usual, Brooks' art direction is lushly rich in style, much like an old technicolor movie. It ""looks"" perfect. Brooks got a first-rate cast: Peter MacNichol gets to ham it up as Dracula's crazed bug-eating servant, Renfield; the late Harvey Korman returns to the Brooks fold after fifteen years as the stately Dr. Seward, so assured he is in the role which shows what an old pro he was; Steven Weber showing great comic poise as a suitor; both Amy Yasbeck & Lysette Anthony show verve as Dracula's victims; and even Mel's late wife, the wonderful Anne Bancroft, nearly steals the picture in a hilarious cameo as the village gypsy. And Leslie Nielsen is..well..Leslie Nielsen, the Clown Prince of Silliness who turns in a controlled but typically bumbling performance as the famous vampire count. The film briefly spoofs the recent Dracula remake (with Gary Oldman), but then settles firmly on the classic familiar trappings (garlic, mirrors, mind control & wooden stakes) and the classic story. The film certainly has its moments: Nielsen's transformations into a bat & bumbling seductions; MacNichol's frantic mugging; Nielsen's mind control manipulations backfiring; and a ""last word"" grudge contest between Brooks & Nielsen. But the biggest belly laugh is a throwback to Brooks' outrageous days: Weber--by way of Van Helsing's (Brooks) persuasion--must drive a stake through the heart of Anthony, which results in Weber getting sprayed full on with what looks like gallons of blood. It's gross but hilariously funny.
DDALI might not be Brooks' best--nor an equal to ""Young Frankenstein""--but there's certainly worse ways to spend your time!",1255996800,,2285,5.096

It featured some good trick shots, but mostly the writing and acting talent made this film a hit with the audience. My son and I had to contain our laughter in the theater as best we could.

On the technical side, this film satirized screen images from Universal's original Dracula (1931), Horror of Dracula (1958), Frank Langella's Dracula (1979), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).

Peter MacNicol simply steals the show as Thomas Renfield, Dracula's bumbling - and more than a little insane - sidekick. In the scene in which Dracula's voluptuous brides attempt to seduce him whilst rubbing seductively against the bedpost and table, his look of absolute shock and his immediate response (""My God! What ARE you doing to the furniture?!) was priceless.

Steven Weber (Harker) also delivered quite a few laughs as the stereotypical sexually repressed Victorian gentleman. Leslie Nielsen was a brilliant choice for Dracula. His facial expressions when his plot to hypnotize Mina (Amy Yasbek) goes hilariously awry are utterly marvelous.

Need I say anything about Mel Brooks as Professor Van Helsing? It's a pure miracle that that man manages to deliver his lines with a straight face! Watch him relate his ""theory of yes... or no"" to Harker and Seward (Harvey Korman), and you'll know what I mean.

Most surprisingly, this was a beautiful film, with some very nice costuming and few neat special effects. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, Dracula, or simply fond of comedy, you won't be disappointed!",1198108800,,1361,4.930131004366812
35398,5,0780623614,"While many people want a movie to scare them around the month of October, others might welcome this halloweeny laugh fest instead!

""Dracula - Dead and Loving it"" spoofs the traditional story of Dracula, using two of the greatest parody film makers of all time -- Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielson! It's amazing to see the way Brooks was able to retool a typically frightening story into a comical triumph. Each joke, gag, and over the top character simply smacks of Mel Brooks wit.

I dare you to keep from cracking up when you watch Renfield pounce on every creepy crawly he finds (while trying to avoid the dreaded enimas from the insane asylum), or when Van Helsing (played by Mel Brooks himself) enters into a battle of wills against Dracula where each man tries to have the last word (it's way funnier than it might sound), or when Dracula creates a farcical mess when he attempts to control Mina with his mind powers. Even some of the simplest sight gags and physical comedy are enough to make you crack a smile!

Sadly there isn't much in the way of special features on this disc. However, there is a very thorough and funny feature commentary with Mel Brooks, co-writers Rudy DeLuca and Steve Haberman, and actors Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck.

This is a true Halloween treat, and a great break from the monotony of endless gory horror movies. This movie is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1191369600,,1406,4.657258064516129
35399,2,0780623614,"It was about ten years ago that I first watched Mel Brooks' ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" and I found it not as funny as I expected from the director of ""Young Frankenstein."" Since then Mel Brooks, it seems, stopped directing films, which is a sad thing if it is true, but anyway I decided to watch his ""Dracula"" again after a decade. The only part I thought funny ten years ago was the scene where Steven Weber's character drives a stake into poor, lovely un-dead Lucy's heart, but is this film really so unfunny?

Sorry if you're an avid Mel Brooks fan, but I had the same impression as before after the second viewing - actors all are doing a good job, but the gags are repetitious and too mild, neither big, clever nor outrageous enough to make me laugh. The storyline itself follows that of Bela Lugosi's 1931 version with numerous references to other new and old Dracula films. They are fine, but Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) appears twice with a Gary Oldman-like hairdo while once is enough. Anne Bancroft appears as ""Madame Ouspenskaya"" prophesying with a strange voice one too many time.

At times, I suspect that Mel Brooks is really trying to make a horror, not a comedy here, for at certain points the film looks as if it stopped being a spoof. I had the same kind of feeling when I saw Eddie Murphy's ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" which also fails to strike the right mood throughout. Technically speaking, ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" is surprisingly good - see the dancing party scene, for instance - but the whole events there are just bland. Count Dracula dances gracefully, and then he escapes breaking the window. Nothing great, funny or otherwise, happens here just like the rest of the film itself.

All the cast including Leslie Nielsen with his silly antics are amusing to see, but there is not much else in ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It.",1185926400,5,1855,4.615151515151515
35400,5,0780623614,"I first discovered this film when I came across it at the video rental store. I hesitated to rent it for a number of reasons: I had heard nothing of it during it's theatrical release; Mel Brooks had been in a slump for some some time; and it starred Leslie Neilsen, who by that time was known primarily for milking his Frank Drebbin character to death in a number of very lame ""comedies"". But I rented it anyway and boy, was I glad I did!

The film is a laugh riot from beginning to end. Of course, it helps if you are familiar with the original Dracula story and its' various film incarnations and are attuned to Brooks' comedy style. If you are not up on the latter, just watch it a second or third time to get into the rhythm. Once you've gotten into the flow, you'll find it's a really fun ride.

While Neilsen, Brooks, Weber and Korman are all splendidly amusing, it's Peter McNichol who really steals the show as Renfield. Many people think of Artie Johnson's turn as Renfield in ""Love at First Bite"" to be the quintessential comedic portrayal of the character, but McNichol is much funnier. I would have given him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this one, but unfortunately, he, as well as the film itself, was overlooked by the critics and the Academy. Too bad, as this film deserved better. The critics pretty much savaged this film (and most of Mel Brooks' films after ""Young Frankenstein""), but apparently the critics have just forgotten how to laugh and simply be entertained by a movie.

His character was as funny as Marty Feldman's ""Igor."" The fake English accents put on by Harvey Korman and crew were hysterically atrocious. Lysette Anthony was the only pure British member of the cast and was a surprisingly addition since she primarily acts in dramatic roles. Her character lends a sense of dignity to the madcap hubris. The one-liners will keep you rolling in your seats like ""There's so much blood...she just ate!""  Anne Bancroft shows up in a 2-minute scene stealing cameo as a mad gypsy woman. And of course, Mel himself as Professor Van Helsing is a hoot. Watch the scene where he is conducting an autopsy in front of a class of medical students.

Mel Brooks took the horror story of Bram Stoker's Dracula and made it into a hilarious movie. Leslie Nielson played his role exceptionally well producing some unforgettable funny scenes. This is a well made movie with exceptional cinematography and great acting. I have watched the movie several times and can't stop laughing. The mirror scene to me was the height of the comedy.

Highly recommend to people with a sense of humour. Also recommended that you buy ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"", if you have not already done so.",1156896000,4,792,4.8161764705882355

We all know the story, so it's up to the cast and crew to make it seem fresh.  Leslie Nielsen is surprisingly low key in the role of the mysterious Count, but he's nonetheless effective.  Peter MacNicol plays the looney bugeating Renfield and with his zany voice and those wacky eyebrows, he's a real hoot.  Lysette Anthony outshines Amy Yasbeck in the doomed female role, with her lusty sexuality compared to Yasbeck's more prim and proper lass.  Writer/director Mel Brooks is subdued as Van Helsing, but he still has that old cinematic charm.  The talented Harvey Korman does well in his role as Yasbeck's veddy proper English doctor, and Steven Weber's stuffy Jonathan Harker is quite good.  Brooks' late wife Anne Bancroft has a hilarious cameo as the village gypsy with the warbling voice.

Some of the best gags involved Dracula's naughty shadow and the staking of Miss Lucy.

Peter MacNichol almost steals the show in this film as ""Renfield."" He just drives me buggy. Leslie Nielsen, who revived his career later in life playing goofy roles, also is very good, this time as 'Dracula."" Actually, I thought he was far better in here than in those other spoofs, such as the ""Naked Gun"" series. It may be his best comedic role.

The two women in here, Amy Yasback and Lysette Anthony, are beautiful, and well-endowed as Brooks - and a lot of us guys - likes 'em. They are in the film for their looks while the other two provide the laughs.

Story-wise, it's just a light-hearted look at the story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for ""Love At First Bite"" which was similar in laughs to this. After watching this film, I could never look at garlic or blood the same way!

I howled at it when it first came out, but at subsequent watchings I just know where the laughs should be, but I don't laugh.  Unlike another reviewer, I don't think it's Brooks' masterpiece.  Unless like Mark Twain said, a classic is a book everyone praises and nobody reads.  I love Mel Brooks.  He, Woody Allen, Neil Simon, Noel Coward, Kaufman & Hart, and Jean Kerr are my 20th century comedy heroes.  But be that as it may.  I like Brooks' looser stuff, less rigidly put together.  Dracula fills the bill.  I had poor sound when I watched it, so I missed much of the dialogue, but what I heard and saw I thought was hilarious.  I can see where in the old days Madeline Kahn and Gene Wilder would have fit in.  I loved this movie, despite what it says on the box there is no sex (damn) and no gore (besides a big bucket of blood in the face, twice) in it.  I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Mel Brooks.  In fact the only Brooks movies I really don't like are Spaceballs (probably because I've never seen the movies it's supposed to be making fun of) and The Producers, which is a perfectly good movie, I just don't like seeing the hero lose.

Renfield visits The Count, who sports that twin hennen-like hairdo, which turns out to be a ""hair-hat"", and is attired in the classic cape and tux. Unfortunately, Renfield proves to be too bumbling and imbecilic to make for a worthy minion, in My opinion, though played hilariously by Peter MacNicol, with the incect-eating propensities and hyena-like laugh.

Van Helsing is portrayed by the brilliant Mel Brooks, who comes off more like a Jewish Rabbi than a professor of forensics and obscure diseases, among his other distinguished titles, including gynecology.

Mina is here depicted as a redhead, while Lucy is a brunette! Usually, it is the other way around, although the actresses are exquisite, as are the voluptuous brides, who can share My canope bed any time!

Jonathan Harker is accurately depicted as a nausiatingly perfidious popinjay, whose naivete' and ingratitude can be frustrating to watch.

35524,3,0780623614,"While not nearly as clever, parodic, or satirical as his cinematic masterpiece YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974), Mel Brooks' 1995 entry DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is nonetheless a humorous spoof of the classic Dracula films that horror fans will likely regard as a worthy companion piece to the comedy director's magnum opus.

The structure of the tight, well-written script for DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT primarily borrows from that of the classic Universal flick of 1931 that made Bela Lugosi a star, but it also takes lots of playful jabs at Francis Ford Coppola's grandiose 1992 interpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel and manages a poke or two at the Hammer Studios flicks, starring Christopher Lee as the eponymous count, that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Fans of the horror genre or vampire sub-genre are likely to enjoy this film more than a general audience, as it requires that esoteric inside knowledge to ""get"" many of the film's funniest jokes.

The casting of deadpan comedic actor Leslie Nielsen as Dracula is a master-stroke, as Nielson's interpretation of a clueless count generates numerous laughs totally independent of the script's laugh lines, yet his performance also greatly enhances the scripted jokes.  Also delightfully wonderful is Peter MacNichol's portrayal of the insect-ingesting Renfield.  MacNichol does a seemingly dead-on (excuse the pun) impersonation of Dwight Frye's manic performance in the classic 1931 film, yet he also manages to adeptly parody Frye at the same time.  It's a performance that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  Director Brooks himself delivers a few good belly laughs in the role of vampire hunter Van Helsing, Steven Weber (of TV's WINGS) is stupendously stoic in the role of Jonathan Harker, and Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony round out the talented cast with their own combination of humor and sexiness.

Overall, the laughs in DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT are more sophomoric and visceral-based than YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.  But even if Brooks' more cerebrally satirical sense of humor is missing here, there are still lots of laughs and the director's genuine affection for the classic horror flicks still shows.

The DVD from Warner Home Video offers a mostly pristine anamorphic widescreen transfer of the flick, and the cool extras include the original theatrical trailer and a feature commentary with Brooks, actors Weber and Yasbeck, and the writers who helped Brooks script the film.  (Actually, this commentary is much more informative and entertaining than the dull, stoic commentary that Brooks recorded solo for Fox's DVD treatment of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.)

Note: This is a four-star flick for hardcore genre fans, but a general audience probably won't understand the basis for all of the jokes and puns.  Thus, the three-star rating given by this reviewer takes the general public into consideration.",1097452800,6,2892,5.233766233766234
35525,5,0780623614,"Doesn't it bug you when people think the older stuff is better than the new, even when the new is clearly better? Classic doesn't always mean ""best,"" and this is the case with Mel Brooks. ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" is easily the best Mel Brooks movie ever made, and second place is ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights."" Yes, ""Young Frankenstein"" is pretty funny, but it doesn't compare to the hilarity and fun of the previous two I mentioned. But why aren't they mentioned as much? I think it's because YF is older and the style of humor was newer then. It's just like when people say ""Saturday Night Live"" was best in the 70's - no it wasn't, it was awful and unfunny most of the time, just look at some of the old clips. But at the time, it was fresh and new. It's bound to make for nostalgia. But I stick to my guns here on ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" - it's Brooks' best, it has a HUGE rewatchabality factor to it, and it looks so good that it has the flavor of a high budget historical movie. It really does look that good. Attention to detail and cinematography is phenomenal. I can watch this movie any time, but I think it would be best around Halloween. Horror and humor are best when hand in hand!",1096848000,7,1203,4.234782608695652
35526,5,0780623614,"Let me say at the start that it's the perfect (and required) companion-piece to Mel's own classic, ""Young Frankenstein.""

That said, I have to admit - this movie grew on me.

When it first came out in 1995 I was still in the military and, though a great fan of Mel's films, I didn't have time to go see it.  Given it's evident lack of theatrical success, it was available on VHS shortly there after and I rented it from a local video store.

At first, it was amusing, but not much else.

However, my local renter gave me two weeks to review it and, as I watched with more attention to detail, I grew to appreciate it's comic genius.

Others have written that it's a salute to Universal's 1937 classic ""Dracula.""  It's all of that, but much more.  It mocks elements of Frank Langella's sexy 1979 ""Dracula,"" but the most obvious parody is Francis Ford Coppola's much more pretentious ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""

Much of the dialogue is lifted, verbatim, from Universal's ""Dracula,"" but given a new twist. For example the theater scene where Leslie Nielsen, as Dracula, attempts to contact Dr. Seward (played by Harvey Korman) and, before entering their opera box, instructs the usherette (played by Leslie Sachs) to ""remember nothing of what I have said"" - she takes him at his word and throws open the curtains to only stare at Seward & company and wonder blankly why she's there!

Another bit of amusing trivia is the famous stake scene.  Steven Weber, playing Jonathon Harker, drives a stake through Lucy Westenra's (portrayed by Lysette Anthony) heart.  In the production, no one told Steven that gallons and gallons of fake blood would erupt - and it shows!  You can actually see Steven struggle to remember his lines and go on with the show.

One other bit of trivia - if there any Cub Scout Leaders out there who've seen this movie, check me out on this.  In the Ball Room scene where Mel Brooks (playing Dr. Van Helsing) is decked out in tuxedo, isn't the medal he's wearing on his lapel a ""Tiger Cub Leader"" scout medal?

See it - Buy it - Love it.  It's very nearly the last of a genre of humor that can be enjoyed by every generation of your family.  From the youngest to the oldest, all will find a reason to laugh.",1095206400,52,2223,4.515
35527,4,0780623614,"I have to admit, this movie is not as funny as Mel Brooks' earlier films but I enjoyed anyway. Leslie Neilsen plays Dracula but like Lt. Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun series.

My favorite line in the movie is when Van Helsing, Harker and Harvey Korman's character (I forget his name) are chasing down Peter Macnicol's character and he tries to lose them.

35528,5,0780623614,"While adhering remarkably to Bram Stoker's classic novel, Mel Brooks has also carefully recreated the atmosphere of the classic Hammer horror films without sacrificing a bit of his offhand and thoroughly hilarious madness, managing to create a minor classic of his own. While Leslie Nielson is the nominal star of the film, and Brooks himself plays his nemesis Dr. Van Helsing, for my money it is Harvey Korman's scenes which win the film and the day (or, rather, night).  The tea-time interview-and-spider-eating scene with Korman as the pompous Dr. Seward and Peter MacNicol as the wheedling Renfield (""It was a raspberry!""), to mention just one example, is not to be missed.  There are lots of others.  By the way, if you see this film before reading the novel, you just might think the novel is based on the film.

You'll see alot of Brooks' regular actors returning for this one including Harvey Korman, Megan Cavanaugh, Amy Yasbeck, Peter MacNicol, and even Ann Bancroft in a cameo in the beginning of the film.  Steven Weber was great as Jonathan Harker as was Brooks as Van Helsing.  Leslie Nielson mixed his ""Naked Gun"" character with Dracula and the results are definately pleasing.  But the standout actor in this film is Peter MacNicol as Renfield, Dracula's slave under his power.  MacNicol's performance is hands down the best of the film.

Indeed, Brooks is a good Van Helsing, and plays the role seriously. Neilsen is a great Count Dracula: sexy as the demon lover, and playful while in goof mode. Don't expect to howl with laughter. Brooks does get involved in the details, and it shows. It's a fun remake, and deserves to be viewed on its own terms.",999302400,,436,4.531645569620253
35606,1,0780623614,"I think the other reviewers definatly were under the influence of laughing gas because I don't think I laughed once throughout the entire movie. This movie was absolutely terrible. It doesn't even deserve one star, because nothing about this one shines.",998784000,2,253,5.195121951219512
35607,5,0780623614,"I love this movie there is so many corks, comedic twist on the Dracula story itself, and clueless charactures you you can't help but roll on the floor laughing even the 12 time watching it.  People usely think ""vampiers, it's going to be a sacry movie"" but this is far from it.  There is so many funny lines like: ""there's so much blood"",  ""master! master! I mean... mister! mister!"" you'll want to qoute them.",996883200,,410,4.513513513513513
35608,5,0780623614,"This movie kept me laughing the whole time. Renfeild is hilarious, and Leslie Neilson does a great job as dracula. The plot is somewhat along the lines of the others but with a comedic twist. I love van Helsing to he is very funny. The rest of the cast is good to but Reinfeild is my favorite, he is such an idiot. The beggining is one of my favorite parts. The gypse woman is hilarious with her con artist like approach to Reinfeild.",995932800,,434,4.240963855421687
35609,5,0780623614,"In this comedy about Count Dracula,Mel Brooks makes this movie something else. Leslie Nielsen plays the vampire Dracula,and boy is he funny and dead. Mel Brooks plays Van Helsing,the vampire hunter who won't give a bloodsucker a break. Stakes,garlic,mirrors,and morethey're all part of a vampire lore. I think this movie is for anyone! You will laugh your buut off! Great cast,music,and story. Leslie Nielsen-Count Dracula. Amy Yasbeck-Mina Murray. Steven Weber-Jonathon Harker. Lysette Anthony-Lucy Westenra. Harvey Korman-Doctor Jack Stuward. Peter Macnicol-Thomas Reinfield. Mel Brooks-Professer Van Helsing.",993600000,,611,6.2
35630,2,0780623614,"Two of the rules that I have developed over the past 10 years for picking good movies and which have yet to be disproven are:

1. Don't bother watching any Mel Brooks films made after Blazing Saddle; and

2. Don't watch any Leslie Neilson comedies that aren't directed by the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team.

Unfortunately, since there was nothing else on TV, I broke my own rules, and this film proves that both rules are still applicable. Mel Brooks has degenerated from clever satires with silly, but well-done scenes, to just plain bad silliness. Like all non-ZAZ Neilson comedies, Brooks' later films, Space Balls and beyond, all come off as badly done attempts to imitate Airplane! that just don't work. They all come off as purely juvenile drivel without the wit or directoral talents of the ZAZ team who know the importance of timing and deadpan delivery to good silly movies.  It is sad that such brilliant people as Brooks and Neilson have taken to making suc! h unfunny, childish garbage.

Get a good Brooks film like High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles or the Producers, or get a good Neilson film like Airplane (1 only) or the Naked Gun movies instead.",988243200,2,1156,4.818181818181818
35631,4,0780623614,"As with ""Young Frankenstein"" you sort of need to have seen the original Universal films (if not the Francis Ford Copolla version) to get all the jokes.  This might be the favorite vampire movie for pre-teen kids.  It sure is in my house.  Leslie Nielsen has the Dracula role nailed in what is his best performance outside of the Police Squad movies (George Hamilton, eat your heart out).  Mel Brooks is slightly over the top, but since when is that news?  You have to go back to ""Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" to find something this funny involving vampires.",973036800,28,564,4.656565656565657

35634,3,0780623614,"I think just about every person I've every spoken to about Mel Brooks has told me the same think:""My favorite is ""Blazing Saddles!"" or ""I love ""Young Frankenstein!"" But this is one you'll never  hear anyone mention.(To some people that's a good thing!) I was surpised to  see what other viewers thought of this movie. I assumed everyone HATED it!  But this is the kind of film you'd expect from Mel Broks,the man who  brought you ""Spaceballs"",or ""High Anxiety"". A silly  crazy spoof! The only way the enjoy this movie is to sit back and relax!  It's not a masterpiece! It's a light hearted comedy! Good for some laughs!  The mirror scene at the end will induce the biggest laughs!",947030400,23,680,4.616666666666666
