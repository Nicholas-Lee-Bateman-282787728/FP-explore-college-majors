4924268,5,B0061DQOXC,"One of the better MST3 movies I've seen, a Touch of Satan is extremely ridiculous but watchable movie.  The characters and the writing is pretty funny and makes it very easy for the MST3 crew to constantly rift.  I really like that this movie seems to have a little more steady commentary then some of the other MST3 movies I've seen.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",1365033600,,399,4.438356164383562
4924269,4,B0061DQOXC,"Above average (but not among the best of the best) 1998 episode with Mike and the 'bots.  The film is all about a girl possessed by the devil and the boy who falls in love with her.  It's kinda fun, but the pace is a little slow.  The riffing is good, though, and most of the host segments are funny.",1361491200,2,300,3.966666666666667
4924270,5,B0061DQOXC,"If you're familiar with Mystery Science Theater, you will see that the riffing on this movie by Mike and the ""Bots"" is especially good, though the movie is legitimately creepy. If you buy the more expensive collection containing Touch of Satan, you will get a very funny introduction by Mike. But for the price this is great.",1357430400,3,325,4.719298245614035
4924271,5,B0061DQOXC,"Take a 1971 turkey about a witch, a handsome drifter, and a leatherfaced, pitchfork-wielding grandma; con the actors into pretending they're in a Harold Pinter play, and have them drag out the pauses between each line of dialogue 'til the audience is comatose; add three riffers at the top of their game to make this unholy mess of a movie watchable, and you've got a very funny ninth season MST3K episode, ""The Touch of Satan."" (Oh, did I mention that it's a Satanic love story?)",1429315200,2,480,4.658823529411765

4924275,3,B0061DQOXC,"Another 70's movie about devil worship and evil in small town America.  Is there a plot to this movie.  The movie tries to be suspenseful with no luck.  Passable, but not one of my favorites.",1399075200,,191,4.4
4924276,5,B0061DQOXC,"This movie is the best worst movie I've ever seen. I love B-Movies and this one nailed it with bad acting. On top of that the guys of mst3k nailed it with commentary. Best line was the ""last days of Edgar Winter reference"". Money well spent. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.",1393459200,,276,4.326923076923077
4924277,5,B0061DQOXC,"It has great unintentional humor, an oddly soothing and disturbing score, and some great riffs.  One of the better later episodes of MST3K.",1368144000,,139,5.043478260869565

4924279,5,B0061DQOXC,All the Mystery Science Theater 30000's are great!! Please add  more. I've already been thru what's on amazon prime and would like to see more.,1367107200,,143,4.72
4924280,5,B0061DQOXC,"This MST3K episode ranks up there with my favorites. The riffing was consistently funny!!!! I took it over to my friend's house for a movie-night to celebrate her birthday. She had not watched any MST3K's ever before, and she had to pause it a number of times to finish laughing!

So if you're a new Mistie or an old one, my recommendation is to add this one to your collection!",1366848000,,378,4.4

8490825,5,B0061DQOXC,"Very funny MST show, and this is a strange bit of drive in fare I might have enjoyed without the MST gang. Directed by the guy who played Billy Jack.",1494892800,,149,4.0
8490826,4,B0061DQOXC,"Take everything you know about lighthearted witches from BEWITCHED or I MARRIED A WITCH and throw it into reverse.  This dispirited and dispiriting minor movie from 1971 concerns a young man in search of himself who encounters a strange, shy girl who has an even stranger family.  This movie is so draggy I can't really imagine watching it unriffed, but Mike and the bots do a good job of sending up the zonked acting styles, glacial pace and overall lack of suspense interspersed with unlikely scenes of shock.  Not the best Mistie episode, but fans will probably like it.
