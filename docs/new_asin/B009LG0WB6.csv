The Grand Duchy of Fenwick is a tiny country in the French Alps (so small it can't be found on a map). It was founded by an Englishman in the 15th century and is the only English speaking country in Europe. The longbow is the national weapon. Their chief export is their wine. The loss of sales due to a cheap competitor in California brought an economic depression. [Do many of the actors look similar?] Their solution is to declare war on the United States, and lose. This will bring an occupation by the US with economic aid and prosperity. [Is there a flaw in this plan?] And so a Field Marshal and twenty men dressed in chain mail leave on foot for the invasion. They board a ship in Marseilles to sail to America. An air raid drill leaves New York depopulated. The Fenwick army is opposed. Germ warfare?

They locate a scientific center where a scientist works on a super-bomb. Dr. Kokintz has a working model. ""Let's hope it will never be used."" The sight of the Fenwick army leads to rumors among the people hiding in the subway system. ""Men from Mars!"" The Pentagon is informed. ""Is this some kind of a joke?"" The Fenwickians capture the Q-bomb! Field Marshal Tully also captures the US Army General in charge of New York. ""We won!"" Is something funny going on? They sail back to Europe. The signs carried in Fenwick tell about these times. Enjoy the music. The Fenwick army returns with their prisoners. ""I showed them"" says the General. This event becomes World News. The BBC announced the NY Yankees beat the Milwaukee Brave ""in the American version of football"".

The Pentagon discusses what to do. European countries want to help Grand Fenwick now. What should they do? The opposition wants to return the bomb and the prisoners to America. Foreign automobiles arrive at Grand Fenwick. Tully looks for Helen. The diplomats play ""Diplomacy"", a board game (like ""Monopoly""). There is a car chase that looks like something from a Mack Sennett comedy. That bomb gets tossed around like a football. Prime Minister Tully signs a peace treaty for its commercial advantage. One item will allow small countries to possess the bomb. Her Highness offers greetings to the President ""and Mrs. Coolidge too"". The last scene jokes about that dangerous bomb. ""Only we know."" And so there is a happy ending.

That Q-bomb was shaped like a Rugby football, a sport popular in Britain and France. Leonard Wibberley wrote this comic novel and other books. It is a satire about life in the 1950s. There were other comedies from Shepperton Studios in the 1950s, some were funnier.",1458259200,,2643,4.67741935483871
