8624255,3,B004QEZ6D2,"This DVD is adequate to to teach someone how to build a computer. There are effectively 2 parts on this DVD, even though it is divided into 3. The first (labeled parts 1 & 2) describes the components of a computer system. The information presented is good. However, I have 2 problems with this DVD and both are in this section of the DVD. First, for some reason the same, loud as the narrator, somewhat annoying jazz tune is unceasing looped throughout this section. It is not subtly playing in the background. I double checked to see if this was ""Build Your Own Computer In A Jazz Club"" and it is not. This same music is also in part 2, but is more appropriately set as background music. Second, the first section is merely a slide show with minimal narration and very few pictures (and zero video) to compliment the narration. Many little comics and other unhelpful slides are background for the text. If this DVD was all done as in the first section I would have rated it 1 star. The second section is decent video of a tech putting a system together and giving a decent explanation as he goes.

The video accomplishes what it offers with low production quality and poor editing.",1314144000,,1182,4.497674418604651
8624256,5,B004QEZ6D2,"I will admit that I bought this DVD because I HATE reading books and, well, it was just 12 dollars so I went for it! I received this video about a week ago from Amazon and I liked it. The DVD has 3 parts to it but I would consider parts 1 and 2 to be one long part. Anyway, It went through all the components a computer should have and how they work together throughly but the part that was most important for me was watching a computer get built (part-3). I watched part-3 several times and enjoyed it. One reason I enjoyed it was because the technician building it seemed ""real"" to me. I mean, he didn't feel dry and boring like some instructors can be. He taught with an actual personality! This DVD does what it says it does and at a nice price.",1299974400,,749,4.1020408163265305
