4123499,4,B003GY75AK,"***** SPOILER ALERT *****

This relatively short, low budget German film with English subtitles starts by following the bar-hopping of a group of Turkish young men, including Nazim (Eralp Uzun), the attractive young man on the cover of the DVD, who comes on to a woman in the bar (Beba Ebner) whom we later learn is a Polish and Catholic social worker with clients in this seedy Neuklln section of Berlin. She is rightly accused of rebelling against her background and of being enamored of the prostitutes who are her clients. Despite having a boyfriend ""Bunny,"" who often stands her up, she goes home with Nazim. Nazim we learn is into every pleasure in the book, from alcohol to cocaine to sex, and his phone-sex calls indicate that he is a bit kinky as well.

On the way home from the subway exit, Nazim is stalked by David (Florian Sonnefeld), and Nazim seems intrigued by the stranger, with whom he shares a beer and then more, clearly a first for Nazim but not David. Conflicts develop when we learn that David is also ""Bunny,"" so there is a love triangle that is discovered when David stands up his girlfriend -- leaving her with two plates of pasta and empty glasses -- and she tries to get even by visiting Nazim, only to discover that David is there. David tries to make it up to her by going to a restaurant but he is carrying a bottle of wine she left behind at Nazim's, and she responds as one might expect.

Neither Uzun nor Sonnefeld are gay, so the conflicted emotions of their sex scenes together seem authentic, and Uzun exudes sexuality for the duration of the film even when he shows some unexpected vulnerability.

The extras include a reunion shot just prior to the U.S. release as well as a making of. An orange VW beetle (""kfer"") plays an interesting role in the film and provides the name of the production company.",1282435200,9,1840,4.533132530120482

4123501,2,B003GY75AK,Just didn't like the plot very much.,1436745600,,36,4.285714285714286

4123506,2,B003GY75AK,"It's ok. Just ok. What I thought was funny (and I don't really mean in a haha kind of funny, but a perplexed kind of funny) was how they were all so upset with each other to find out that they were all sleeping with each other, unbeknownst to each other. I mean really, none of them had any ""outstanding morality"" other wise they wouldn't have been doing what they were doing. They were all upset with each other and fighting because neither of them were exclusive to the other. True examples of the pots calling the kettles ""black"" ... seriously?",1434240000,,547,4.425742574257426
4123507,2,B003GY75AK,"Movies of this nature are stereotypical.  The main character hides behind drugs & booze so he may allow himself the true nature of his sexuality.  He resorts to violence so everyone will believe that he is repulsed by the gay actions of others. All the characters are hurt & lonely and the movie audience comes to the end of the movie with whats next?, What Happens now? Will there be a happy ending? Not in this movie for sure. Only the two male leads deliver a true and believable performance, but the director does not deliver on the title. It should be ""Confused.""",1434240000,,568,4.504854368932039
4123508,2,B003GY75AK,"This movie feels just as lost and confused as all the main characters in it. The actors are good, but that's just about it.",1434240000,,123,4.166666666666667
4123509,1,B003GY75AK,"Is it me or has gay cinema went downhill,I am so tired of seeing the same movies always about a bisexual or gay guy always a drug addict or always miserable and depressed, wanting that straight man but the straight man always ends up with that woman and the gay guys ends up being depressed, how many times has that story been told. Then they have to throw in a girl to not make the movie to gay because of the homophobic rating companies. I would like to see just only a gay movie that is not based on stereo types or misery,the majority of gay people are not drug addicts. These foreign films have lost there artistic expression.skip this trash and watch querelle,maurice(at least he ends up with a gay man in the end and doesnt get depressed about not having his first fling)boys life the first one,those are great films.these newer gay(slash wanna be foreign must be restricted from telling a real good gay story where the gay man ends up with a happy life,or is not bi-sexual.",1284422400,20,981,4.455555555555556
8396641,2,B003GY75AK,"ummm...didn't get it.  Acting was pretty lousy and the story was a little too contrived.  I felt ""forced"" to believe it but, still, it was too awkwardly unrealistic to do so.",1477008000,,174,4.580645161290323

8396644,3,B003GY75AK,"Intresting.
It's not good.
But it isn't awful.
Yes, a bit clich.
But compared to a lot of other flicks in this genre @ at least it didn't make me want to shoot myself",1468886400,,166,3.911764705882353
8396645,1,B003GY75AK,Film was of below average interest.,1468800000,,35,5.0
8396646,2,B003GY75AK,A muddled mess of a threesome in which a woman finds out that her male lover is also carrying on an affair with HER boyfriend. These are all unbearable human beings and the situation is neither played for comedy nor compassion. Would have found it more interesting is the screenwriter had tried to make a point of the goings on and not left if for the audience to make up our own minds. As such the film meanders without direction.,1465257600,,431,4.4
