Similarly Gankutsuou: the count of Monte Cristo made young people who rarely touch the books other than textbooks and manga books begin to read voluminous 7-volume Monte Cristo books written by Alexandre Dumas. Comparing gensaku(original novel) with its adaptation is one of the popular ways to enjoy animation series in Japan. Famous classic literature works has often been turned into manga series, the most noted example of which is the Tale of Genji.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tale-of-Genji-Kodansha-Bilingual-Comics-English-and-Japanese-Edition/dp/4770027028/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tale of Genji (Kodansha Bilingual Comics) (English and Japanese Edition)</a>.

In this chapter, the counts revenge plan seems to be fullfilled one after another. Albert's father was accused by Heydee in public. According to her she used to be the princess of the distant galaxy empire but because of the man who betrayed her parents and she became the slave. The count of Monte Cristo bought her and raised her just like his own daughter. Peppo the boy who wears female dresses and thinks himself like a girl plays a greater role in latter half of the series.(He? is one of the most popular cross-dressed characters in Japanese animation history). Frantz the best friend of Albert tries to find out about the secret of Gankutsuou who the count of Monte Cristo actually is(just like Ryoji and Misato of Neon Genesis Evangelion do about the secret of NERF plan). And he gets the key information from the unexpected sources. Mate Shikashite Kiboseyo(Attendre et esperer, Wait and hope) are the coin words often appear in this animation series.

Note: The opening and ending theme songs were sung by Jean Jacques Burnel the bassist of UK punk rock band, the Stranglers.

Verdict: Part of revenge plan are done. Then what will happen to Albert?

8101325,5,B000CRR2NE,"The entire Gankutsuou series is worth any anime-lover's attention. The animation is like nothing ever seen or used before, it is completely innovative and overflowing with artistic brilliance. The soundtrack is incredible, sometimes mixing the most unlikely of genres, like techno and opera. And the story itself is classic literature with a twist (personally one of my favorite classics of all time; who can resist a tale of revenge?). The only disappointment may be to fans of the book who are expecting the original ending. But this show is absolutely your money's worth. ~A",1178496000,,577,5.148936170212766
8101326,5,B000CRR2NE,"With this volume, the series is more than half done.  Even if you think Albert is a bit of a idiot, he finally understands that something evil is happening shortly after this volume begins.  He knows, but can't see how it's all happening until. . . Well, it's really, really, suspenceful.

The animation is still something to behold-watch for a journey through cyberspace,another into the mind of an old man and on the Count's ship in outer space.

This is one of the best anime series I've ever seen. It's been two days since I saw this volume and am still thinking about it.  It requires a few viewings to take it all in.  This series is meant for grown-ups who are looking for a story and art design that appeals to adults because it's themes and story line are more interesting to adults than to children or some teens.",1147305600,2,823,4.453333333333333
