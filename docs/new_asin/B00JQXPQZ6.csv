It's amazing how these two meet at a central range of style and expressions to pull this twist of one person with two faces off. This is a movie for all people - the action lovers (especially the revenge scenes *spoiler*), the die hard romantics, and the ones who love to go to concerts with all of the grand dance numbers that look flawless. This makes a good weekend (or any day for that fact) movie pick to get all pumped up. Yevadu just pulls you in and won't let go, even after the film ends.",1426550400,,567,4.2592592592592595

8653403,2,B00JQXPQZ6,"The movie is 3 and half to 4 stars, depens on which half you ar watching, as it is like two movies glued together, but even though on the DVD and here at the product info it says 16:9, it's cut to 4:3 format. You can just see half of the logo (which stays during the whole movie, again, and by itself is irksome). Also you have disgusting anti-smoking add at the beginning. Picture and subs are good, though, that's why I give two stars and not just one. A pity that Indian studios keep ruining their own work like this.",1419811200,,520,4.158415841584159
