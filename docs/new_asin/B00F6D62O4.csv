5968214,5,B00F6D62O4,I loved watching this on tv. I have purchased and watched the past two seasons and really enjoyed them. Can't wait to watch it,1384560000,,126,4.291666666666667
5968215,4,B00F6D62O4,"Again, this is a great series for Gene Barry fans.  Barry played the role where he is a bit arogant but beleivable.  I can't wait for season four of this series.  This did not run for as many seasons that Wyatt Earp did.  This series showed us how Bat might have been in real life.",1383868800,2,281,4.054545454545455
5968216,5,B00F6D62O4,"I wondered why, after TGG Direct first released a best of Bat Masterson set, (That has about half of S3 on it) then seasons 1 and 2, why they didn't release Season 3. The dreaded rights issue popped up for one episode. Would be interesting to find out what exactly that is. Music? the story? Checked imdb and saw the writer of this show wrote other episodes of Bat Masterson. Guess we will find out someday. But, I agree with the others, would much rather have 33 of the 34 shows, than no season 3 release.
Thanks again TGG, keep up the excellent work of releasing shows that the bigger studios have no interest in releasing to the public on DVD.",1382572800,8,646,4.347107438016529
5968217,5,B00F6D62O4,"I received this email from TGG when inquiring about the missing episode.  ""The missing episode from this season and other seasons released by TGG is due to non authorization to clear an episode.  It is not in the authority of the licensee to determine whether or not an episode must be cleared.  TGG Direct has worked very hard to clear many of the missing episodes from each Season released, however, due to issues beyond our control, we have been unsuccessful in our progress.  We felt holding out on releasing the season would not be fair to the fans of the show.""",1382400000,15,567,4.584158415841584

5968225,5,B00F6D62O4,"""Bat Masterson"" is a fun western, with more comedy than a lot of such series.  Gene Barry is splendid in the title role and the half-hour stories are always entertaining.  This set of Season 3 is a good deal, and worth your money if you enjoyed the earlier sets or are a fan of westerns in general.",1402963200,2,298,4.2105263157894735
5968226,5,B00F6D62O4,"Gene Barry made a great Bat Masterson. I was too young to enjoy these when they first aired. So, having the ability to see them in order and in their entirety was a great experience. If you like or enjoy good values, good old time westerns then this series won't disappoint. My only complaint is that there were only 3 seasons. This series should have continued on and gone into the real Bat Mastersons life more. Many of the stories are entirely fictional, some based in truth with minor fictional changes. All of the stories are great.",1402704000,,537,4.546391752577319

5968229,5,B00F6D62O4,This is the finial season of the show I enjoyed the first two seasons that is why I bought this one. What good is one season without the rest. Should you choose to purchase the set you can't go wrong. This is a classic Many of the people who starred in this series have passed on and have taken the legion with them. Enjoy it because I know that you will.,1396656000,,355,4.014084507042254
5968230,5,B00F6D62O4,"I like good old fashion westerns. Gene Barry is one of my favorite actors, I like his tough but charming character. I also love to watch his co-star the beautiful Allison Hays. Her  beauty is so addicting ! I would recommend this show to anyone who likes classic TV because it is class.",1391990400,,286,4.39622641509434
5968231,5,B00F6D62O4,Have just been watching episodes from all 3 sets but can't understand why set 3 is missing an episode? Another company on Amazon has complete set for sale and it includes the episode missing from this set but their quality isn't as good.,1391385600,,237,4.534883720930233

5968233,5,B00F6D62O4,"With the Exception of One { 1 } thing, I love this Series.  As for Season # 3, the Company that had Burned the Information on to the DVDs, Didn't do a Very Good Job.  It was on the 3rd Diskett I think it was, Eposoide # 3 if I'm NOT Mistaken that the Eposoide  Continued to Freeze Up @ the Exact Same Clock Timing which was @ Approxamitally 8 Minutes into the Eposoide, and then the Remaining of that Eposoide was Deleated from the Diskett, and it Automaticlly Skipped to the Next Eposoide.  This Happened on ALL 3 or 4 Copies that I had Received.  Which means, that the Company that is Burning these DVDs Continue doing a Herrendious Job with the Burning of the Information onto the DVDs, and there getting away with Ripping OFF the Public as well as ALL Business's!
  But Aside from that One { 1 } Problem, this is a Fantastic Show, and I Highly Reccamend it to Anyone and Everyone.",1390003200,,884,4.25748502994012
5968234,5,B00F6D62O4,"I am a person who grow up in the 50's and enjoy western movies and tv western series.  I have been watching this series slowly only one or two per week, kinda like the way I did back then.  I wish there were more of them at this reasonal price.  I very much dislike the fact that too many other series gives you only half a season at double price.",1389312000,2,347,3.9285714285714284

5968236,5,B00F6D62O4,All three seasons of Bat Masterson are now available on DVD. One of the best westerns ever! ! ! !,1387065600,,97,3.9
5968237,5,B00F6D62O4,"Gene Barry continues to portrait Bat Masterson in this third and final series of one fo the most exciting and well remembered westerns of the late 1950s.

Relive the TV series in this 33 episodes of series three on four discs, of a man who became a legend in his own time. He wore a cane and a derby hat and was one of the best dressed lawmen to tame the Wild West in the 1880s.

Roaming throughout the west he charmed the ladies, helped to right the wrongs of the unjustly accused, metered out the law to the lawless, in the progress made many friends and his enemies hated him with a vengeance.

Now, in the Legend of the West, there stands a man above all the rest, the man who had the fastest gun, they called him Bat, Bat Masterson. With a gold-knobbed cane and his specially made six-shooter, his legend preceded him most of the time, and made many people cringe at the mere thought of his name.

No western fan could possibly pass up the opportunity to own this exciting TV series that, with regret, lasted only three seasons. Each series was crammed to the hilt with half-hour shows and inspires me no matter how many times I watch one of the best series ever.",1386806400,6,1168,4.319634703196347
