I looked forward to seeing Calendar, especially after spending 5 months in Armenia on assignment, but came to find the film to be overly indulgent and ultimately obsessively redundant. It's a visually beautiful, slow moving movie, but the dialogue and plot progression soon become tedious, and I struggled to get through the final 30 minutes. I appreciate Egoyan's nontraditional use of storytelling structure, as well as the integration of film and video technique. As well, his multi-language, multi-ethnic approach to demonstrate a stagnant romantic life of the main character is especially effective.
Still, I'm not drawn into the triangled relationship among the three characters, and find Egoyan's use of dialogue tedious at best. Arsinee Khanjian is as talented as ever, and I am of the opinion that she has one of the finest emotive voices in film today. Unfortunately, Calendar is a rather poor vehicle for her, and I have come to appreciate Egoyan as a more complete filmmaker when he removes himself from the screen and focuses on directing/editing. Within the body of Egoyan's work, Calendar is still relevant, but as a stand alone story, I can't say too many good things. If you like films focused on the complexity of relationships that grow at snail's pace, Calendar may be for you...",1267920000,,1421,5.051063829787234

One watches it once simply to figure out what happens, ie, the breakup of a marriage, and a second to start picking up the signs of why the couple drifts apart.

Calendar satisfies on so many levels: as I heard Arsinee Khanjian's voice pleading with her photographer husband to pick up the phone, my breath stopped - her voice conveys such pain, so much emotion, and she is half a world away!  It is a beautiful film that shows 11 Armenian churches and one pre-Christian temple, gorgeously lensed.

Egoyan, as many of you may know, is regarded as one of the pre-eminent directors out there today, and in Calendar, it's obvious how he earned his stripes.  He mixes monochrome(and rough looking video) with more refined 35mm film, but the effect is completely coherent; it doesn't feel pretentious at all.

But what steal the show are the performances.  Arsinee Khanjian has a wonderful performance as a soulful woman who takes a chance at love.  Atom Egoyan plays a modern photographer who is an emotional void, a cipher.  Ashot Adamian plays the guide who attracts Khanjian, who opts to stay in Armenia after the picture shoot is done.  There is one scene, however, which sent chills up my spine: At a derelict castle, a man who only speaks Armenian recounts an incident of its history.  I don't speak a word of the language, but his voice, his inflection, and the way Khanjian listened and what she says to her husband are completely riveting.  There are no subtitles, no explanation of what the old man says, but it is a brilliant scene hinting at the power of language to convey happenings of long ago.

There is a theme Egoyan is chiseling here: how modern life drains out the soul from people.  All the characters are of Armenian descent, but Egoyan, the most westernized character, seems bland, colorless, without real thoughts (which gets pointed out in the pagan temple scene.) Khanjian, Adamian and the man at the castle seem much more self-possesed,  more in touch with some vital and passionate current.

In twenty years, this movie will be regarded as one of the classics of cinema.  It is deliberately enigmatic, not easy to figure out, but yields a treasure box of wisdom.  Please see this film for yourself and get as much meaning from this gem as you can.",1192752000,3,2420,4.6674528301886795
