7998513,5,B0000CABKL,"One must not look at this movie as just another urban drama, but one must look at this movie with all eyes, ears and inner soul into the reality of this movie. African Americans and Latino's in this American society which we live in are always facing tough hard decisions based on the material, which is money, jobs, housing and even relationships with our families and friends. The main character is sorrounded by the every day prejudice, jealousy, racisim and anger that is thrown at the African American youth every day.  Yes, this is real.
  Parents and Community leaders of the African American culture should have more of a positive less corrupt image through media and radio, so that the children can have something else to look forward to as they grow up.  This movie shows, that even still today, young youths are put threw so much pressure and stress to live a more positive life and life style because people in the same culture are sometimes not around you to uplift you but they want to bring you down.............this is also real..............so.................thanks for showing this reality to the public, hopefully it will bring a better understanding of more of the positive direction African Americans need to go and how we all should uplift each others independent success in life.
  Giving positive vibes to ""Solo"",Stoney L.(""""Yess""""),and also ""Reese"" at Exile Records, ""Cool Nerd"", all of the Maewi Records Staff and all the music Artist that had there songs in this movie like myself.........yes......

But the 2 undercover cops, i hated them, i know thats what the director wanted too, because i know some slimmy undercover cops just like that, but there's some graphic nudity that i would definately keep my little sister from seeing, eevn though i know thats how it is in the hoods all over.........lol.....
