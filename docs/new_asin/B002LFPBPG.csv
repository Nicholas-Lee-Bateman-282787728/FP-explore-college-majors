8372942,3,B002LFPBPG,"Contains very little original Rammstein content, no interviews with band members or concert footage. Some photo stills from concerts That I hadn't seen before are nice and the interviews range from people with a semi valid connection to Rammstein to people with a pretty tenuous connection who's interviews are better as a joke.

I have heard criticism from my friends as saying Rammstein is anti american based on the song ""Amerika"" and they have been called fascist, which as others have pointed out is xenophobic to assume, Till goosestepping onto the stage for the opening song of the vokerball dvd qualifies him to be as much of a fascist as Bowie was during his thin white duke phase and his famous quasi nazi salute. Rammsteins music is simple at times, mostly massively detuned chords played with a brutal chainsaw rhythm, yet rich with undertones and grandeur. Some prefer to call it Industrial instead of metal but they just plain rock to me, but the disc in question does suck. There are 3 good Rammstein DVDs Available, Live Aus Berlin, the incredible Vokerball (both aforementioned being concert DVDs , and the video collection Lichtspielhaus that has all the videos from Du Reisht so Gut to Fier Frei!. The Family Values Tour 98 DVD Also has a short 2 song Rammstein concert footage section with the infamous fake wang on Buch Dich and short interview with Flake as well as some backstage antics featuring Tiel giving a european style smooch to a member of orgy and a very cool looking Till and Chris ""Doom"" Schnieder trashing the backstage area and leaving with an authoritative ""Party Over"" when some female groupies go into a fake lesbian shtick to the delight of the more easily impressed members of other bands.  Avoid Tanz Metal and the other unauthorized bio Industrial Angels unless you are a real hardcore Rammsteinian. Buy them all or Tiel Lindemann will visit you late at night with his flamethrower.",1365984000,6,1925,4.865853658536586

8372944,2,B002LFPBPG,"I am a Rammstein fan.  So, I ordered this DVD on its release date, only to find out that it is an unauthorized Rammstein biography.  There's no music, band member interviews, etc.  It was very disappointing to press play on my DVD and see the message ""this is an unauthorized biography"" followed by a menu to access the biography, a fan quiz and discography.

Feel free to pass on this one.",1262908800,54,390,4.450704225352113
