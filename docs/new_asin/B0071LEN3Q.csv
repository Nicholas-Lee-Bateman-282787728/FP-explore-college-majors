The main guy would love nothing more than to nap his life away, unfortunately his best friend is the king and wants him to work and the way to make that happen is he threatens a very strong sword... and she loves dango, but if she does not make him work the will burn down the dango shop she loves. So in order to save the worlds dango they adventure and cause problems.",1337212800,2,492,3.9797979797979797
5048757,5,B0071LEN3Q,"It is kinda pointless to write more about the story. The people before me have done that already although speaking from a personal POV I must say I really liked it. It is one of the few series that does not rely on pointless and idiotic fanservice with panty flashes and boob exposure.

The set contains BOTH a DVD set AND a Blue Ray set so even if you haven't a blue ray unit you can still enjoy it until you can afford a BD player.

Another good thing is that both the DVD and the Blue Ray set work perfectly on Region 2/B machines. In other words it will work just fine if you have a PS3 unit from Europe. (It works perfectly on my slim PS3 and my unit has official firmware and is not modded in any way to bypass protections and stuff.)

The same goes for the second part of the set. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071LEQ1A/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01

All disks will run on region 2/B machines.

So for anyone still unsure I say feel free to buy it. You won't have troubles watching it.

Small detail that I must clarify though. I am using an HDMI cable and HD monitor to watch it and it works fine. However I can NOT confirm it will work on old TV sets that can not support NTSC signal.",1336780800,,1195,4.3125
5048758,3,B0071LEN3Q,"This series has a fantastic start, strong animation promising characters that are actually original and something of a story taking shape. After episode 5? I  started to loose interest fast, my biggest problem was ferris. She is such a b#*^h it gets kinda hard watching, as the humor falls flat. I don't mind the typical violent female, its a staple in pretty much very single anime, but she is so abusive, unkind and generally violent, I found her completely unlikeable and as a result any time she was on screen I couldn't stand her. Yeah she could have been cool, I mean shes a female who can fight, that's cool isn't it? isn't it!!

It really bothers me because this show could have been so much more engaging to me if they just wrote her character as a little bit nicer. Being one of the main characters she dragged this series down to much for me to purchase the second half as im not even remotely interested in watching her pointless repeated abuse. The lead male is such a well done character that its a shame ferris is even in this series because i would really like it.

This isn't a bad show at all, but if your tired of watching angry violent abusive women doing the same gags over and over again. you might want to pass this one up. Again not bad, but the leading lady killed it for me personally, to each there own.",1336003200,6,1330,4.376518218623482

5048761,5,B0071LEN3Q,"This review covers the whole series (Part I and II) and contains no spoilers.

- Introduction -

These 24 episodes are a prelude. A prologue. This anime is an adaptation of the light novel series. It is an excellent series nevertheless, in anime or light novel format.

Unfortunately the light novels which cover the story after these 24 episodes, as of now, remain largely untranslated. The story gets so juicy after 24 episodes. But. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginning.

Ryner Lute and his friend Sion go to a military school for the poor and the orphaned. They train for war as tools for the nobels. The setting is much like Europe, multiple nations, multiple war fronts, and tension between all kingdoms/nations.

The school is sent out on a mission. I won't say how it ends, for it would be a spoiler but it's not too interesting. In fact, it is rather predictable. The anxiety and constant fear of the red headed main female character gives it away.

Ryner is arrested after the battle and is tortured for being an Alpha Stigma, a powerful magician-berserker. Sion is chosen to be the hero of the battle and the red headed female is released in exchange for Ryner's freedom. (The red headed female is such a minor character I can't recall her name.)

Ryner spends years writing a thesis in regard to legendary relics of power. Sion, now king, discovers this thesis and spares Ryner from the death penalty (given automatically to Alpha Stigmas).

From here Ryner meets Ferris, a bishoujo that is a demon with the sword -- and dango consumption.

I think that's enough summarizing. Let's get into why this anime is so good.

- Characters -

Ryner and Ferris both have lazy and laid back personalities. Whereas Sion has a workaholic drive and endless ambition. This foil creates a fun and comedic atmosphere. Ryner and Ferris slack and Sion gets on their case for being such slackers. All three of these main characters change subtly throughout the anime, then at the end you can see the accumulation of all the subtle changes. It's drastic. They've changed. And it changes the relationship dynamic. Bonds are broken and bonds grow closer.

In short, the characters are fun and memorable.

- Plot -

You won't be disappointed with the plot. There are political elements (corruption, struggles for the throne, crises, alliances), constant war (nations fighting against one another, major powers rising, weaponry), and how the characters play into these worldly events. The characters featured in this anime are major power players. The world moves around them in this anime. They are the strongest and they are the most powerful. The most powerful change the world.

- Packaging -

The packaging for this anime is rather nice. Individual slots for each disk, a decent box, and a small tarot card bonus for each Part. The special edition for Part I includes a red box inside with some neat character art, but both Part I and II have lackluster art on the outer boxes. Part I's special edition box's backside is akin to the DVD covers. The DVD covers feature main characters and also decorate the inside. They're alright. At least consideration was taken into decorating both the inside and outside of the DVD case (whoops, I forgot, I meant Blu-ray case). The DVD's/Blu-Rays are nothing special. Blue themed disks for Blu-ray, red for the DVD's. The art on both is just an Alpha Stigma symbol. Not exciting but it works.

Can you tell by now? I'm sure you looked at the product picture and could figure it out. Part I and II are a combination of Blu-rays and DVD's.  So you get to watch the whole series in either Blu-ray or DVD quality. Yippie. It's a nice bonus.

- Quality -

I won't review the quality aspect of this release. I don't have time anymore to watch the whole series again (for the third time) but I can tell you that it should be good. Come on. It's Blu-ray.

- Thanks for Reading -

I hope you found my review helpful. I really enjoyed this series and therefore put in my time for a detailed review.",1334620800,14,4047,4.678420310296191
5048762,5,B0071LEN3Q,"I loved this series.
I didn't know what to expect when I started the series.  The main story revolves around Reiner.  However, this anime has a huge cast and is not always focused on Reiner.

The story starts off light, but as more and more characters are introduced, you see that the anime is much darker.  Political undertones, action, comedy, and light romantic hints.

I originally watched this anime online and loved the story.  I decided to purchase the blu-ray version to see the anime in all it's glory.  The blu-ray version does not disappoint.  You can watch it dubbed or subbed with the original Japanese track.  The first blu-ray disc has two episodes with commentary.  I do wish there were more extras.  But I can't complain as the main reason to get this was to watch this fine series with blu-ray clarity.

After all of the episodes, the anime is a bit unfinished in the grand story.  Hopefully they will do a continuation in the near future.",1334620800,10,957,4.625
5048763,5,B0071LEN3Q,"The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is partially about the misadventures of Ryner (magician) and Ferris (swordswoman).  I say partially because despite their pictures on the Blu-ray boxart, there are episodes where they're nearly absent for other characters and storylines.  The bulk of the main and mini-stories does gravitate around Ryner and Ferris however.

Legendary Heroes is a political drama at its heart; dealing with the kingdom of Roland and its neighboring nations.  There is a lot of conversations between different characters, laced with flashy action sequences and the occasional slapstick humor.  Composition wise, I'd say 50% drama, 30% action, and 20% comedy.

What stands out in this show for me, is that most of the characters are a little rough around the edges.  There is no morally high ground character who only accomplishes good deeds.  Everyone has varying levels of selfishness, and to me, makes for a show with some friction that mirrors reality.  I guess in simpler terms, most of the characters have depth, and do not simply play an archtype.

Another theme I enjoyed about Legendary Heroes is that even seemingly 'evil' characters have their uses, and sometimes ally themselves with the supposedly 'good' characters to accomplish a common goal.  There are only a few clear cut instances of actual good vs evil.

Other Legendary Heroes keynotes:

- Ryner is the focus of physical abuse.  Mostly by Ferris.
- The mood of the show is primarily brooding.  This trend is broken on occasions with humor at the expense of Ryner.
- There is no outright romance.  Though there are hints of romantic tension between certain characters.
- The action sequences are fun to watch, comprised of magic and sword users.
- Death is prominent.  Characters die, and in many cases, in gory fashion.
- There is no fanservice or nudity.

I am writing an pre-release review, because I watched this show on Hulu.  Initially, the odd title caught my eye and I thought I'd watch an episode or two to pass a Saturday afternoon.  Little did I realize that I would be at episode 19 the following Sunday morning.  Episodes flew by quick, and my normally reserved self was eagerly eating up episode after episode.

I watched the show in Japanese with English subtitles.  However, I've no doubt that the English dubbing will be as equally good by the Funimation team.  Mostly the same voice actors from the following shows, also vocal their acting chops in Legendary Heroes:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clannad-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005HWAOOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clannad: Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bride-is-a-Mermaid-Complete-Box-Set-S-A-V-E/dp/B00BCPOEIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bride is a Mermaid: Complete Box Set S.A.V.E.</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baka-Test-Summon-the-Beasts-Season-One-DVD-Blu-ray-Combo/dp/B004TP55T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - Season One (DVD/Blu-ray Combo)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spice-Wolf-Complete-Series-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00HXEWFWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spice & Wolf: Complete Series (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>.

5048767,5,B0071LEN3Q,"Ryner Lute would like nothing more than to sleep the days away in peace. Unfortunately, he has a strange and unrivaled magical power sleeping within him.

The unlikely pair is on a mission to find relics of a Legendary Hero. These relics will ensure that the Kingdom will remain powerful and rule over the land with justice.

This anime surprised the heck out of me. It has excellent animation, voice acting, and a great soundtrack. There are lots of cool characters, an involved story, plenty of comedy, action, and drama. It has it all. The title is kind of generic and lazy, so I didn't expect much. That goes to show you that you can't judge a book by it's cover. If you've seen shows like Berserk, Record of Lodoss War, or Ragnarok; and liked them, you'll probably like this series. Personally, I think it's better than all of the titles that I mentioned before.

5048770,4,B0071LEN3Q,"Adventure, political intrigue, action...all this and more can be found in FUNimation's Blu-ray release of ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" (Densetsu no Yusha no Densetsu), an anime adaptation of Takaya Kagami's popular Japanese light novel series.

Originally featured in Dragon Magazine and presented with illustrations by Saori Toyota from 2002-2005, ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" has received a light novel sequel, plus two spin-off series (a collection of short stories) plus drama CD's and a Sony PSP video game.

A 24-episode anime TV series was produced by ZEXCS and both parts will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment in April 2012.

The anime series was directed by Itsuro Kawasaki (""arc the Lad"", ""Noir"", ""Venus to Mamoru""), screenplay by Kiyoko Yoshimura (""Chocolate Underground"", ""Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing"", ""Gravion""), character designs by Noriko Shimazawa (""Final Approach"", ""Otoboku"", ""Bleach"") and music by Miyu Nakamura (""Utawarerumono"", ""Manyu Hiken-cho"").

VIDEO:

""The Legend of Legendary Heroes"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The anime series does feature beautifully painted backgrounds (as one would expect from an adventure-based series) primarily trees, clouds, surroundings areas, while the series does focus a lot on closeups of the characters.  There is CG use when the characters display their magical powers but for the most part, the series looks good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the lossless audio, you get a English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mix. The English dub has a better dynamic range (considering it's a 5.1 lossless track, while the Japanese version is a 2.0 lossless track) and due to the complexity and many characters featured in this anime series alone, FUNimation Entertainment brought out their top guns to provide the voices of the characters.

The Japanese soundtrack is also very well done especially when it comes to the more emotional moments, the voice acting is stellar. But the English dub has the advantage because of it's 5.1 mix but if you prefer to watch it in Japanese or English, both soundtracks are excellent and should appeal to Sub/Dub anime fans.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 1 comes with the following special features:

  Episode 3 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Brina Palencia (voice of Kiefer) and J. Michael Tatum (voice of Miran).
  Episode 9 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director/line producer Colleen Clinkenbeard (voice of Noa) and Monica Rial (voice of Iris).
  Textless Opening Song - Featuring the opening theme ""Lament (Yagate Yorokobi Wo)"" by Aira Yuuki.
  Textless Ending Theme Song - Featuring the ending theme ""Truth of My Destiny"" by Ceui.
  FUNimation Entertainment trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

Back in the '80s and '90s, adventure-based anime series that typically captures kingdoms and political corruptness were storyline banalities.  But from 2000 and on, once in awhile you come across these complex anime series and can only hope that more of these will be made.

So, for fans wanting something deeper and a bit more complexity with their anime series may enjoy ""Legend of the Legendary Heroes"", a storyline about warring kingdoms, political corruptness, action/fantasy/adventure, etc.

""Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" incorporates lot of fantasy elements that people are used to seeing in an anime series, sword fighting, magic-use and in the case of this series, plenty of violence. While watching the series, while there are protagonists and people who seem they are evil, every characters has their flaws.  For example, Sion wants to fight for peace, but in order to achieve peace, one must do the unthinkable in showing people that you have great power.  Ryner is a person who hates war but when his Alpha Stigma is used, he becomes a killing machine.  Kiefer is a person similar to Sion who wants peace but because the Roland Empire was using her as a double spy, she was involved with the massacre of her teammates.

""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" is a series that viewers will want to watch without any distractions because of the amount of characters featured in the series.  Granted, with each branching storyline, there is a good amount of character development that allows the viewers to understand motivations and why things are happening like they are.

Despite the complexities of this anime series, you get a bit of seriousness and humor.  For example, storylines that related to Sion are often serious and emotional, while storylines revolved around Ryner and Ferris  (non-battle sequences) are often comedic as the two are like a ranting couple and despite the pain that Ferris puts Ryner through, the relationship between these two characters are hilarious, until you get to the battles and things can get very serious.

So far, the first half of the series has been entertaining but it will be interesting to see how this series resolves itself by the second half.  It seems that the more Sion wants to attain peace, Miran does something unthinkable and Sion is powerless to do anything about it.  If anything, despite being a king, he is a puppet.  Also, things are heating up in the Ryner/Merris storyline as they are constantly being hunted by Gastark Empire's Sui Oria and Kuu Oria.  So, this series is definitely has a lot of potential going into the second half.

While the series was given 24-episodes, having not read the light novels, I don't know if everything made it into the series but I do know that the series was quite favorable by viewers in Japan.

As for the Blu-ray release, the series looks absolutely wonderful in HD but I wish the series was self contained as a complete collection instead of two separate parts.  As for special features, you do get a few audio commentary from the English dub voice actors.

Overall, ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 1 is a deep, complex anime series that will appeal to fans of the fantasy anime genre.  There is a lot of action but there are also branching storylines that deal with drama, action and political strategy, and because of that, I found the series to be entertaining and enjoyable.

If you are looking for a fantasy anime series on Blu-ray, definitely give ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 1 a try!",1352332800,,6409,5.082217973231358
5048771,1,B0071LEN3Q,Not sure why this is getting so many stars on this site there definitely need to be more thorough reviews. Do yourself a favor and see if you can make it through more than three episodes of this anime before considering purchasing. I had a hard time but forced myself through part one (with it on mute after a while) just to see if at any point it was worth it. This has some painfully repetitive points and episodes with no progress at all. Don't get this expecting any good action sequences or amazingly drawn anime.,1348617600,,518,4.40625

5048773,5,B0071LEN3Q,"I believe that the show called The Legend of the  Legendary Heros: Part One Limited edition Collection and Part two series are very simliar to another show that I am fillimar with is D-Gray Man. This show has a lot of action just like D-Gray Man. I would rate this product a five star anime series to watch and also suggest that amazon has the best price for this product. If you go to a store like Best Buy you have to pay about $59.99 plus the total price of 62.98. It's the same price for paying for a new playstation or new xbox 360 game. The voice cast of this show is okay. But I give the music opening theme song a good score. The show is probably based on a Rpg anime adventure game.

8508479,5,B0071LEN3Q,"This anime has it all, action, intrigue, drama, romance, comedy and above all - quality in all categories.

It's a sword-and-sorcery anime without stupid quirks... something I've been hungering for since Record of Lodoss War.  The animation is peerless, and the english-dubbed voice actors do the best job of any cast I've heard so far.  The action sequences aren't a dime-a-dozen, but they aren't sparse either; and when they do come around they are well-animated, and do not fall prey to repeated drawings overlaid on a different background like so many other animes.  The characters that fight all have unique styles, varies magicks, and sundry abilities.

The plot is fairly straightforward, but with enough depth to be engrossing.  The characters themselves fail to conform to archetypes, and all have pretty extreme depth usually found only in the literary versions of the motion pictures themselves. The action and drama is broken up pretty regularly with comedy.  However, the comedy is genuinely hilarious - not the more typical Japanese comedy that has no connection to the story, the art or humor in general.  It evoked literal lol'ing from me nearly every episode.

If you like sword-and-sorcery tails, action anime, good storylines, deep characters, fantastic artwork and grown-up epics -or any one of those things- then it would be a crime for you to miss out on this series.",1402185600,,1389,5.110619469026549
