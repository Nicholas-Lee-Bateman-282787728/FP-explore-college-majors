Its very easy to learn, short, and invigorating but not strenuous.  I've taken Tai Chi, various forms of Yoga and Pilates and this is my favorite practice to date because it boils down and incorporates everything you need into one short moving meditation that includes stretching, breathing, concentration and muscle tension.  I can't endorse this product enthusiastically enough!  If thisDVD has helped my back pain after one session I can't wait to see what it does with continued practice.  Highly recommend this DVD!!!",1200787200,8,676,5.0
7928728,5,B0000507QI,"I bought this DVD after seeing Master Tan on TV. As a Martial Arts instructor, I had hopes of learning more about ChiKung and the internal side of Martial Arts.  I wasn't dissappointed!  The first time I did the three minutes to power, my muscles felt as though I'd been lifting weights.  I was also instantly more energized.  But it was after doing the three minutes to peace for every night for several weeks that I could feel the energy moving through and healing my body.  I'd had cronic shoulder and elbow pain for years and after a couple of weeks doing the Universal Form, it was gone!  And I haven't had any more in the three years I've been practicing the Universal Form.",1134000000,11,680,4.443548387096774
7928729,5,B0000507QI,"This DVD is easy to follow and the exercises really seem to work. I was somewhat dubious at first, but after trying the exercises I'm quite excited. The form is easy to learn, and the format makes it easy to follow from the first time. The same form is used for a ""power"" exercise and a more meditative ""peace"" exercise. Both work well, and his philosophy appears well thought-out and grounded.
I like the fact that he uses real people in the video, not models or experienced martial artists. It has a authenticity to it.
If you want something more simple to learn than Tai Chi, yet has many of the same benefits, I would recommend this video.",1026604800,13,643,4.4576271186440675
