6448834,3,B00KUWUKPI,When I saw this in the theater I loved it but watching it again it is definitely dated. Recommend for people that saw the original when it was first released.,1357516800,,158,4.3
6448835,3,B00KUWUKPI,"The movie is still a classic, but dated. I was wondering the whole movie why they didn't turn some damn lights on since they were hunting for a crazy homicidal alien. Oh also, the audio was slightly out of sync like most Amazon videos I stream from my ps3 to my TV.",1357430400,,265,4.115384615384615
6448836,4,B00KUWUKPI,"Downloading the film took much longer than I anticipated.  Once the film downloaded, though, it was great quality, no freezing, no continued loading.",1355356800,,149,5.478260869565218
6448837,4,B00KUWUKPI,"I spun up Alien in anticipation of watching Promethius.  From that context, it was nice to go back and see the original story.  There are some interesting overlaps (but small and almost insignificant) - Alien didn't explain or set a backdrop for promethius.  My guess is that Scott had the prop with the giant in the navigation chair left over in his garage and wanted to base a whole movie around it.  It was a minor part of the Alien movie - a scene seen in passing at most.

but giving the movie it's due - I once again enjoyed seeing the original story.  With all of the follow up movies, the simplicity of the original flick was lost and in my mind at least, I had the story lines of the 5 or so alien movies all mixed up.  There were parts of the original that I forgot completely, so it was nice unscrambling my recollection again.",1351555200,,838,4.265822784810126
6448838,5,B00KUWUKPI,Alien and Aliens are two of the best sci fi movies ever made.  Quality of the video was very good and no interruptions in play.,1351382400,,127,4.08
6448839,4,B00KUWUKPI,"I had just seen the new ""Prometheus"" in the theater and wanted to review the original.  This movie is, of course, a classic and never lets the viewer down.  I rented this from Amazon's streaming service and was very happy with the picture quality on my HDTV via my PS3.",1344124800,,269,4.36
6448840,5,B00KUWUKPI,"C'mon!  What else can I see. It started a whole new way of filming, story-telling, creativity.  Just awesome. Just incredible how the special effects and robots they made for this movie. Nothing but a good time.  (and yes.. there's a slow pace to it... but if you like and know about Sci-fi a lot of the movies are slow-paced).",1342742400,,327,4.508474576271187
6448841,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I wanted to watch Alien again prior to seeing Prometheus in the theatre.  My fifteen-year-old daughter, who had never seen Alien before, watched with me.  I was amazed at just how well this movie has aged--in the sense that it is just as scary and wonderful as when I saw it way-back-when.  Alien is timeless; aside from the green-screen monitors, you would never know that this was filmed over 30 years ago.",1342569600,,408,4.638888888888889
6448842,5,B00KUWUKPI,Rented and watched it before we went and saw Prometheus! It was great and good to watch b4 seeing that movie. I had never seen the original but Prometheus followed a similar plot line and there were a few other similarities. Everyone should see this at least once!,1342224000,,264,4.520833333333333
6448843,5,B00KUWUKPI,Still the best alien movies ever made. It gives chills the whole time keeps you tense without any big explosions or loud screams like movies do now a days,1341964800,,154,4.344827586206897
6448844,4,B00KUWUKPI,Watchable movie. No graphic nudity.,1523923200,,35,6.2
6448845,5,B00KUWUKPI,"Very solid deal. You get the alien blu ray disc, some pictures and drawings by H.R. Giger and a small comic book adaptation of the film. One thing that isn't really a problem but surprised me was that the box that everything is found in isn't as thick as some other special editions of this kind I got. Instead of the hard texture they normally have, this is kind of thin.",1522713600,,372,4.253521126760563

6448849,3,B00KUWUKPI,"I know it's a classic, but... it was so boring and slow... I couldn't finish watching it.",1517961600,,89,4.294117647058823
6448850,5,B00KUWUKPI,They don't make movies like this anymore. Movies like this were scary because they didn't show the monster. You didn't know what was there which made it even more scary,1517702400,,168,4.633333333333334
6448851,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I didn't actually get to see this movie until I was a teen but after all was said and done this movie blew me away by and large.  As I hadn't seen alot of Sci-Fi movies and only a few Sci-Fi tv shows at the time plus at that time I had only previously seen bits and pieces of Aliens, all that this movie had to offer me felt pretty new to me overall.

All of that being said; let's get down to the brass tacks.

First of all; here's some facts about the movie:  Directed by: Ridley Scott.  Produced by: Gordon Carroll, David Giler, Walter Hill, Ivor Powell, and Ronald Shusett.  Screenplay and story by: Dan O'Bannon with co-writer Ronald Shusett.  Featuring an all-star cast of:  Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphett Kotto.  Musical score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith.  Cinematography by: Derek Vanlint.  Production Companies: Brandywine Productions.  Distributed by: 20th Century Fox.  Release to theaters by: May, 25 1979 in the US and September 6, 1979 in the UK.  Production Budget:  $11,000,000.  Domestic Box Office:  $78,944,891. Foreign Box Office: $24,000,000.

Nowadays plenty of later generations have been further spoiled by this movie visuals, feel and tones, and atmosphere.  Back in the day though Science Fiction had never quite arrived at this movies landmark style before.  This clever Sci-Fi/Horror movie is dark, suspenseful, foreboding, eerie, unpredictable, and best of all it had a creepy yet brilliant and imaginative design for the Xenomorph's planet, the eggs, the Facehugger, the baby alien known as the Chestburster, and most of all the adult Xenomorph Alien know as the Warrior.  AVGN said it best when her referred to this movie as being akin to being like a slasher only in outer space.  Keep in kind this movie came out long before Jason X so while this movie isn't a slasher per se it does bring one to mind in its style.

As far the characters of Ellen Ripley(Sigourney Weaver,), Brett(Harry Dean Stanton), Ash(Ian Holm), Dallas(Tom Skerritt), Lambert(Veronica Cartwright), Parker(Yaphett Kotto), and Kane(John Hurt), there's not alot to know.  Here's what there is to actually know about them:  Dallas is the captain of the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley is the warrant officer of the Nostromo, Lambert is the Nostromo's navigator, Brett is the engineering technician, Kane is the executive officer and also has the misfortune of being the Xenomorph alien's unwilling host, Ash is the Nostromo's science officer and also an android, and Parker is the ship's chief engineer.

This movie has one highly effective creepy atmosphere when it comes to it's the dark, eerie, and dreary alien planet that doesn't offer much light to navigate it, the cool looking corridors and rooms on the Nostromo that are decently lit but still offer some eerie and dark corners where anything could be hiding, captain Dallas's brightly lit command room with cool looking buttons and switches on the command panel, also there were some unusual but interesting shapes up and down the walls of each room.

The score by the late/great Jerry Goldsmith was beautifully done and it carried the suspense and terror perfectly in all of the scores notes and tones.

H.R. Giger created several unique, original, highly imaginative costumes and puppets for the brilliant alien designs.

While the characters were all basically one dimensional, the premise, creature design, atmosphere's, suspenseful torror, and the actors brilliant and believable performances more than made up for that.  I love Jones aka Jonesy the cat also.  He was cute and sometimes became the innocent bystander/witness to what goes on when the Xeniomorph is around.  The cat not only gives the audience a friendly non-human character but also one that is as a an observer of things as we are in the audience.

The Blu-ray quality is stunningly gorgeous and as perfect as I felt the DVD transfer was this transfer more than surpasses its greatness in picture and sound.  I also love the packaging with the shiny black color and the metallic letters and picture.

Overall, if you are into Ridley Scott in his better years, alien movies, slashers, suspenseful terror, atmosphere and claustrophobic terror,  and Sci-fi than this movie is a must see hands down.  10 STARS OUT OF 10!!!",1517011200,,4321,5.009817671809257
6448852,5,B00KUWUKPI,Needed to see this and was so pleased. Great movie even today.,1515715200,,62,4.25
6448853,5,B00KUWUKPI,Kinda my favorite movie ever.,1515456000,,29,5.0
6448854,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I saw Alien many years ago and viewed this through Amazon Prime so I could show my kids.  So many countless movies copied the techniques, style, and imagery from Alien that to watch it today for the first time will not have the same effect.  It was an original, a trend setter, and a classic.

If you want it to have the same impact on your kids that it had on you (if you saw it when it first came out in the 70s), then make sure you show it to them before they have been exposed to all the copycat movies.  But make sure they are not too young - it is rated R for gore and scary scenes.  There are no adult/sex scenes.",1515110400,,620,3.928

6448873,5,B00KUWUKPI,"When I talk about my Top Ten Movies, this is always in the top 3.
I recall when I originally saw it, I was trying to put the popcorn bucket over my head.
The Nostromo spaceship is a fantastically great setting for this thriller, and the coolest thing is that, with the exception of the video graphics on the gigantic CRT monitors, this movie looks timeless and could have been filmed yesterday, not 40 years ago.
Everyone needs to see this movie at least once, and after you calm down you must see the follow up ALIENS, which is completely different and yet ever bit as fun. (also in my Top Ten Movies)",1503360000,,602,4.336283185840708
6448874,5,B00KUWUKPI,Great movie. Very 80s. It won't disappoint.,1502928000,,43,5.285714285714286

6448876,2,B00KUWUKPI,"So yeah, the movie is great, we all know that. Unfortunately this is a sham release of the film on Blu Ray. For about 25 dollars you can pick up the Alien Anthology,. which when pertaining to this movie, comes with a special features disc loaded with hours upon hours of behind the scenes and original promotional footage. If you want this movie on Blu Ray, it's well worth getting the series box set for that disc alone. Speak with your wallet, please don't get this paltry 1 disc release.",1501718400,,490,4.455555555555556
6448877,5,B00KUWUKPI,"A fantastic film from Ridley Scott. The pacing, acting, lighting, composition, and everything else are superb. Some people say the beginning of the film is too slow, but I completely disagree; the beginning of the film slowly builds tension while giving you sufficient time to admire some of the best sets ever constructed in the history of cinema.

As for the Blu-ray itself, the image quality is excellent. Despite being a dark film with high contrast in nearly every shot, I never noticed any color banding or other artifacts. A major plus is that the disc jumps straight into the menu without making you watch trailers.",1500336000,3,623,4.877358490566038
6448878,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I mean this move is a phenomenal classic, there is no debating that. Especially reading the book prior to watching this when I was a child. It was invigorating. Sigourney Weaver was one of the best actors, not just female actors in the 80's. The slow beginning really sets the setting of the movie. I like how it is more focused on horror than thrill and action like the other Aliens, and this is a great movie for new comers and people who want to reminisce. For the prequels like Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, they seem way more futuristic, but that is the only thing that bothers me.",1499299200,,588,4.453703703703703
6448879,4,B00KUWUKPI,"Decided to watch this after the most recent movie release (Covenant) to better understand the history. Awesome female lead and SyFy storyline. A little old and cheesy now, but still very fun and interesting.",1499212800,,207,5.117647058823529
6448880,5,B00KUWUKPI,I love the new Alien movies but OMG Sigourney sucks! I give this 5/5 because amazon delivered the product great and as ordered but I will NEVER watch again.,1499212800,,156,4.413793103448276
6448881,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I watched it with Rifftrax and my boyfriend and we both laughed a lot. I haven't seen it without Rifftrax in years, but it was pretty much how I remember it. I honestly don't have as much to say about this as I thought I would.",1498176000,,227,3.9565217391304346

But movies have come a loooong way since then, so compared to modern movies, it's just ""okay."" However, I was impressed by the acting.

Funny because recently it was explained to me that this movie was really the first female as action hero movie.. and I didn't really realize that until later... So, my daughter is quite impressed in Riipley as a Bad A** female protagonist... so naturally, we're going to have to watch more of the series and probably go see the latest Alien incarnation in theaters now...",1496188800,2,533,4.494845360824742

Atrocious lighting, thumb-sucking dialogue, blind ignorance of the laws of physics, deplorable casting, 100% predictable aside from one of the characters turning out to be a robot. The most ridiculous space ship set with steam! leaking out of pipes all over. But Ridley Scott didn't abandon motivation altogether, like most 2nd and 3rd rate directors, so I didn't walk out, and gave a star for that. For $3.99 I couldda had a cheeseburger and fries and not have to put up with a pathetic performance from Weaver.

Sigourney Weaver plays Ellen Ripley, an astronaut of sorts.  In her travels her crew receives a distress signal.  Thinking they'll be recipients of a pay-off in the form of cargo or such the crew boards the vessel only to find it a mess.  This is not for the weak minded, stomached or anything else.  This is scary stuff directed by the awesome director Ridley Scott.  The movie put Scott on the map and Ripley (Weaver) into the annuals of hotties.

6448922,5,B00KUWUKPI,An amazing movie that is a great example of directing and story. Let's start from the beginning shall we? The movie begins when a starship called the 'Nostromo' is ordered to investigate a distress signal. There well you have to watch the movie hehe. Overall it is a great movie and is still by far very scary by 2016 standards and will forever be remembered. People complain of slowness in the beginning but it's character development and cinematography. Sadly this franchise was killed by Aliens.,1475798400,,498,4.870588235294117

6448932,4,B00KUWUKPI,"I do not like Ridley Scott. There, I said it. I'm not one for his bravado. HOWEVER, this movie was excellent from start to finish. Taking quite a lot of cues from 2001: A Space Oddyssey, this movie perfectly utilizes silence and space in order to sustain the tension the viewer is feeling. The scares were gruesome and the deaths were super wild, but what makes this movie a classic isn't what the alien looked like or how it killed others, but how it remained an unseen and ever-present entity that could strike at any moment and the unfortunate crew of the Nostromo were all too easy prey for this angel of death.",1474329600,,615,4.451327433628318

I had nothing to worry about. The movie still looked great and mostly believable after all these years. The ancient computer interface was all that threw off the effects for my teenagers, but it was easy to write that off to the ship being a commercial mining ship with cheap and worn parts.

6448969,5,B00KUWUKPI,"I swore I was done buying movies from the ALIEN franchise when I bought the Quadrilogy DVD box set. I've owned about every format of the movies, buying the rebuying special editions over the past 30 years. I swore off new formats but couldn't resist this copy. The price was right and it comes with a mini ALIEN comic book adaption of the movie, plus some beautiful production art postcards suitable for framing.
The bluray transfer is crisp and the movie itself stands the test of time. Some older sci-fi movies just don't look good on bluray and the flaws can be magnified.
One edit I did notice was the chestburster scene. There's a flub during the actual burst and you can seem the bloodpack underneath John Jury's shirt. It was one of those things you notice after repeated viewings. It made it to the DVD, but it was finally digitally fixed on the bluray. It's a small detail But shows that they really examined the film.  ALIEN is beautiful. A testament to Ridley Scott and HR Giger.

6448984,5,B00KUWUKPI,"Fantastic film that has held up over time.  Wonderfully shot with beautiful use of camera angles to propell the viewer into the story and get a real feel for not only the human element cast so far out into space, but the vastness of the space and the loneliness that surely must have enveloped the characters and that will envelop future space travelers.  As the film evolves, this gives the viewer a real sense the isolation of the crew adrift on the sea of stars with a (at the time of the original film) mysterious and murderous intruder in their midst; a genuine alien in all respects.

Yes, the tech depicted is dated, but this is really minimal and limited to some flashing lights on control panels and monochromatic screen displays which are quickly lost in the atmosphereic and cinimatic treat that the film provides (and in some ways adds to the feeling of being alone and detached from warm, earthly things).

Also, compared to other sci-fi films of the same era there are no glaring fashion and hair style gaffs of the 70's (Battle Beyond the Stars or Star Wars, anyone?) which is just as important in allowing the film to stand the test of time.  The commentary by the cast and by the director Ridley Scott add fantastic insight into how and why the flim was shot the way it was and how a film from 1979 can outshine many (dare I say most?) sci-fi films and stories of this modern era.

All-in-all a true Masterpiece that has its haunting beauty brought into the 21st century with Blu-ray remastering.",1457395200,,1513,4.564575645756458

6449054,5,B00KUWUKPI,"Many millenia ago, when I was a teenager, I saw Alien.  Unfortunately not in the movie theatre.  Of course that was back in the old VHS days.  But when I got the chance, I originally purchased these on those same VHS tapes.  Then the Special Edition DVD.  Then, of course, blu-ray.  I found the 35th Anniversery Edition at Costco, and went BUY IT!!!!!!  So I did.  While many of you know that I LOVE my cheesy movies, I do REALLY enjoy a quality film.
  The original Alien delivers that in spades.  The 35th Anniversery Edition includes an Ultraviolet digital copy, the 1979 theatricle release, the 2003 director's cut, the usual Blu-ray commentaries, A comic book, & reproductions of H.R. Geiger's concept art for the Alien film.  This an excellent buy for those who love this type of genre film.  And the film is great!!!",1424649600,,823,4.631944444444445

The blu-ray itself is the same as past blu-ray releases, the only thing new here is the reprint of the comic from the 70s and some cards of artist H.R. Giger's work.

I think it's a great set for an awesome movie (though I wish there was a little more Giger stuff in honor of his recent death).

The one star is because Amazon packaged this item in an envelope instead of a box. Seeing as blu-ray discs are fragile and require protection, and the fact that envelopes offer no protection, my copy was delivered to me smashed and beyond repair. So thanks.",1413158400,3,683,4.456

Fox Executive: ""Hey guys, I have an idea, let's throw a mini comic and some art cards in with the bluray disc in a snazzy black and chrome box and call it a day!"" I'm pretty sure that's exactly how it played out when brain storming this weak set. What a slap in the face to the fans and the film makers!
 This is how FOX pays TRIBUTE to H.R. Giger the artist who created the ALIEN and without his contributions there would be no ALIEN franchise? Some artwork cards. WOW. I would've loved to have seen a new featurette segment on Giger as a legit tribute but NOTHING new is added in the way of extras to the disc. They couldn't even make the effort to include anything from the big box set.
 The ONLY reason I quadruple dipped and bought this set was for the umpteenth time was for the snazzy mini comic reprint of the original ALIEN comic published by Heavy Metal Magazine back in 1979. The new artwork on the box and the disc cover is a plus too. This is for serious collector's ONLY and is not worth the money if you just want to watch the movie.",1412726400,12,1201,4.240174672489083

6449110,1,B00KUWUKPI,"Ridley scott's classic ALIEN from 1979 has been given another blu-ray re-issue
by 20th Century fox
the first blu-ray release of ALIEN was back in 2011 but released with only little bit of extras
the extras are 2 Audio commentary tracks, one by Ridley scott
the 2nd commentary from some of the cast from the film
there's also Deleted & extended scenes aswell
the Making of Documentary that was produced for the 2003 special edition dvd is Gone from this blu-ray
no idea why 20th century fox didn't carry over the making of Documentary from the special edition dvd
that had new interviews with ridley scott and some of the cast and crew from the film
i think that is a total insult for fans
there's no reason why 20th century fox could've easily added the 2003 making of Documentary to this 2011 blu-ray
Quite a pathetic release if you ask me

it's now 2014, and 20th century fox have decided to re-issue some of their classic films again on blu-ray
as 35th Anniversary blu-ray editions
and ALIEN is one of those classics chosen for a 35th anniversary release
and i tell you what it is nothing special just another waste of money
this new blu-ray re-issue is just a re-packaging of ALIEN that's all it is
it's packaged as a cardboard box with a big thick booklet included and some photo cards
plus the ALIEN BLU-RAY case
the ALIEN BLU-RAY DISC is exactly the same as the 2011 release
with the exact same extras as the 2011 release
there are no new extras like a new featurette to celebrate the films 35th anniversary
all 20th century fox has done is just re-package the blu-ray release with a new booklet with some photos
and now they're trying to sell it just to get more cash, what an insult
personally as fan of the film i think it's a big insult.
if you already have the 2011 blu-ray release just keep it
it's a big waste of money to get this 35th anniversary release unless you want the new booklet of photos that come with it
i personally can't see the point, waste of money
