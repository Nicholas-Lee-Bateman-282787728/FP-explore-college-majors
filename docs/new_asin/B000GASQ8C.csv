8130130,5,B000GASQ8C,"Absolutely LOVE this. Beyond wonderful bargain price. The package got here within two days, and that's with standard shipping. The product was brand new, still in the plastic wrap. They look GORGEOUS. The DVDs all work perfectly, the sound and picture is great. Not a single problem with the seller or the product. This show is great for kids of any age. Great values and morals, great characters, great adventures, gorgeous animation of the caliber we just don't see anymore, great voice acting. The commentaries, extras, and documentaries are awesome, insightful, and inspiring. Hours of fun, all of it. I loved this when I was a kid, I would recommend it to anyone who has children. I love them just for myself even now! He-Man was a big part of my childhood growing up and watching the show over again is so nostalgic. I cannot recommend these DVD sets anymore highly than I already have. They're just perfect, in every way. I'm just over the moon with this purchase!",1439596800,,971,4.7514792899408285

8130133,5,B000GASQ8C,"If your a child of the 80's, your a fan of Animae, a fan of Masters of the Universe, then this is just what you need because do I need to say anymore than that it is a nonstop action, fantasy, sci-fi, animated thrill ride time machine dvd series of an era long gone but still fresh and new to its' fans like me. I give this dvd series two power of greyskull yells because it is freaking awesome. It will bring children of any age a lot of fun and enjoyment as well as long centuries of entertainment. As a fan of HE-MAN I say may the Power of Greyskull be with you viewers everywhere.",1304294400,,584,4.043103448275862
8130134,5,B000GASQ8C,"This was everything I expected.  I received it in brand new condition. It has been very nostalgic for me to see this series again after so many years. I loved the show when I was a kid, and it is great to see He-man in action again.  This show also teaches morals and good behavior.  There are many lessons to be learned throughout -- not just in the ""one-minute moral teaching segment"" at the end of each episode. Outstanding!",1252713600,2,427,4.379746835443038
8130135,5,B000GASQ8C,"These DVD sets of He-man are better than I remember.  The colors are excellent.  I especially like that there is a lesson to live by at the end of each episode.  Although not high tech computer generated animation, they are excellent to watch.",1244937600,,243,4.604651162790698
