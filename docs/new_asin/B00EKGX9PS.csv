8606351,5,B00EKGX9PS,"This was absolutely one of the best, most romantic stories that I ever saw.  If you have no problem with male to male romance, then I would suggest seeing this one.  There are explicit sex scenes, both  rape and consensual .  Apparently this was supposed to be only one movie of a series, and the others were never made.  Basic story:  takes place far in the future, where the human race has spread out to other planets. The human sphere is invaded by an alien race, superior in technology and firepower and they are set on wiping out the human race entirely.  The most devastating part of the invasion is that alien war machines absorb the fighters that they do not kill outright. Once absorbed, there is nothing human left.  They become part of the machine, their memories and all they are is used now to kill their fellow humans.  A special unit, who are trained to operate huge mechanical war robots is created to battle the aliens.  The two heros, Leonard and Tiberias, are roomates at the training facility.  The facility is run by a piggish, sadistic pervert of a commandant, who preys sexually on the youngest cadets.  Leonard is the older soldier, already battle hardened. He takes Tiberias, the younger cadet under his wing. Eventually the commandant rapes the young Tiberias, who is rescued by Leonard. Leonard finishes the Commandant by cutting off his privates.  The entire episode is hushed up.  A few days later Leonard is being transferred to the front lines.  Leonard and Tiberias have fallen deeply in love, and have a single night of passion before they are separated.  Leonard gives Tiberias his combat knife as a memento.  Leonard's battle wing is destroyed, and he does not return.  A short time later, Tiberias leads his own battle wing against the enemy aliens.  Everyone on both sides is wiped out, except for Tiberias and one alien war robot.  To his horror Tiberias finds that that this friend and lover Leonard has been absorbed by the alien machine he is facing.  Tiberias robot is destroyed, because he cannot bring himself to fire on the alien which has absorbed his friend.  He ejects from his robot before it explodes.  At this point of no return, Tiberias remembers that Leonard had made him promise to kill him if he were ever to be absorbed by one of the alien war machines.  Tiberias  pulls the combat knife that Leonard had given him, springs onto the front of the alien war machine, where he can see his friends terribly changed, but still partly human appearing body.  He drives the knife into his friend's chest, killing him.  He leans in to kiss his lovers face, which is beginning to disintegrate as the alien war machine goes critical.  Tiberias clings to his love, not caring if he dies.  A moment before the alien machine explodes,  Leonard's hands  come up out of the machine, and push Tiberias away, with enough force that he is thrown clear before the machine explodes.  Some part of Leonard still survived, and he acted to save Tiberias at the last.  The final scene is Tiberias, tears streaming down his face,  coming to attention and saluting the destroyed robot where his friend now rests in peace.  The write over states that here, in this place,  was the first victory of the human race in their battle against the aliens.  (which suggests that Tiberias survived and returned from the battlefield.)  While incredibly sad, it was a splendid, romantic and very touching story.  I have found that the Japanese generally do not go in for happy endings, but have some of the best, most moving stories.  At the very end of the film there is a scene of the human high command finding the buried starship from the series Star Blazers.  It makes you really wonder where they might have gone with the story, if it had continued.  But even as a stand alone, it is well worth seeing.  The music, especially at the end, is very beautiful and evocative of the mood.  Beautiful, sorrowful, but showing that love is stronger than war, stronger than time, and stronger than death.",1454284800,,4018,4.69484240687679
8606352,3,B00EKGX9PS,It left you wanting more to the story line. It does say to be continued but it is not that I found. it was a let down.,1403827200,,118,3.4074074074074074
8606353,1,B00EKGX9PS,I just wasn't a huge fan of this. It felt like it took too long for the main couple.  They finally have a chance and then bam total sadness. It was a let down for me.,1403308800,,166,3.611111111111111
8606354,3,B00EKGX9PS,"If you own ""The Legend of the Blue Wolves""; it's Exactly the same, Just a different title! Wish I had known before I had purchased it!",1397260800,,134,4.1923076923076925
8606355,3,B00EKGX9PS,"I gave this DVD 3 stars....do I recommend anyone get it....NO, I don't. 45 minutes long, very predictable sometimes visually pretty the two ""stars"" are beautifully rendered. There is an evil fat guy who wants the beautiful young Jonathan and Leonard wants to protect him. The reason I don't recommend it is because it looks like there were supposed to be more and I can't find any? do as you will.",1393200000,2,397,4.605633802816901
8606356,3,B00EKGX9PS,"I am confused. This OVA (which was originally intended to be the first of three, the latter of which were never made due to a lack of funds) is called Legend of the Blue Wolves. It's worth a look if you're into yaoi, or science fiction, keeping in mind that the story was never finished, but why is it now being called Hot Space Cowboys? Is it to sell more copies? I admit, this title is more catchy, but for a product that's not just about sex like a lot of other yaoi OVAs, it is rather demeaning to the story. I admit I'm more than a little confused.",1382400000,8,553,4.08256880733945
