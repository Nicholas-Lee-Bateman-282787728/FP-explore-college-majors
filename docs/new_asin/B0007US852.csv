8051972,4,B0007US852,"These DVD's have a few old interviews from years ago when polyester was not retro.  The interviews are repetitive in nature and are of poor quality.  For someone not interested in metaphysics this one may get away from you, however if this is the type of information you enjoy (as I) then you will see the brilliance of Mr. Fuller.

I had only heard of him via mentions from persons like Dr. Wayne Dyer, but once I heard the content of what he was preaching I understood very quickly how far ahead of his time he really was.  His ideas are even considered forward thinking today, although the science community is catching up to him.

By the last interview I got a bit bored since he was discussing the same thing but will still give it 4 stars for the content.  If you have some spare time and are interested in metaphysics and similar thought then this one would be a good watch on a rainy afternoon. If not, then you might get bored after the first interview.

I'm glad I gave it shot, the old master was worth it.",1254182400,6,1017,4.321052631578947

8051975,2,B0007US852,There are three interviews on this dvd with Mr. Fuller.  They are all from the mid 80's and all look like low budget public access shows.  The interviews are not very worthwhile.,1120003200,12,178,4.53125
8051976,3,B0007US852,"This is not the first video of Buckminster Fuller you want to own. I was hoping for interviews with the man interspersed with diagrams, drawings, photos and models of Bucky's concepts and ideas. Not so. These are strictly interviews. In fact, there are three different interviewers  (from three different time periods) who ask very similar questions. Therefore, much of the information (Bucky's answers) are repetitious! Great for learning how this man thinks and his philosphy, but not as well rounded as I was hoping for.",1087862400,8,523,5.152941176470589
