8348576,3,B0020MSTAY,"I bought this DVD for library purposes being an ardent Mozartian. As always with Mozart. the music is worth listening to and the only other DVD of this opera  is the Salzburg disaster. This staging is a disaster too, Eurotrash with a capital E. It is set in modern day LA in a sweat shop. What are these people thinking of, that we are too simple minded that we need this rubbish to appreciate Mozart. The singing is good, not great and the orchestral playing is quite good. I will play the music and turn off the video.",1443225600,,520,4.3061224489795915
8348577,5,B0020MSTAY,"This DVD was made like a TV drama  or a movie; I felt that I was at this stage along with cast through lighting, and casts were at the front of me while traditional theatrical opera don't provide this atomospher.  The casts' performance as singers and actors were so wonderful and passionate.  I enjoyed their precise face expressions and sweaty performance at the front of my eyes.",1385596800,2,382,4.6716417910447765
8348578,4,B0020MSTAY,"While I can agree with other reviews that this set may leave something to be desired (and didn't enjoy a post in front of Sean Panikkar's face too many times), that would be the ONLY reason I'd give it less than 5 stars.  The singing, by Sean, and the rest of the cast, was brilliant.  Mozart's music only makes me wish that he had finished this.  But Sean Panikkar in this easily reminds me why he's my favorite tenor.",1385164800,2,419,4.2784810126582276
8348579,5,B0020MSTAY,"A friend told me this was great. My wife thought it was too real. The week before we had happened to see a semi-staged production that was presented as a light comedy with a new happy ending added. (Mozart left this early opera unfinished, although he did intend to resolve a happy end.)
Peters Sellars takes the presentation of slavery seriously and lets it end where Mozart stopped. Anyone familiar with Sellars knows he sees present-day relevance in earlier operas. In this case the slavery takes place in a Los Angeles warehouse housing a sweat-shop that exploits illegal immigrants. (These shops have been found in L.A.)
Not Mozartean? Maybe, except in this context the music, as another review says, ""is sublime"". Much more so than in the light-hearted production I saw. The connection between intense acting and the emotion Mozart puts in characters is unnerving. Excellent singing, dark romantic realism and brilliant music.
Sellars is known for his ability to direct acting in opera, but now he seems ever more serious and less ironic about human nature.
Sellars finds remarkable singers from minorities. This too is unusual and disorienting.
Altogther a wonderful statement and experience. Mozart the liberal rebel would have loved the way his music works.",1301875200,8,1266,5.120772946859903
8348580,2,B0020MSTAY,"I was intrigued by the fact that this unfinished and almost unknown opera was released on a DVD. I was very disappointed after about 5 minutes of watching it, and couldn't change my mind as I listened and watched through it. I could accept, not like, the weird stage and time transposition, but when the whole production becomes centered on the staging and its political/moral message, while the music is relegated to be less important, the result is a not-so-good theater and certainly a not-so-good opera. Mozart had many messages and social criticism in his operas. Some are witty and daring, but the music is always what makes his operas great and sublime. The filming of this staged production is just terrible. In fact, unless you know a priori that this is a staged production in front of an audience, you couldn't know it by the way it is filmed. Only at the end you ""see"" the full stage for the first time.
My kudos to the singers. They have to go up and down the stairs so many times that it is amazing they can still sing. I really dislike the close-ups that show every sweat drop on the singers face.
Some of the arias are really beautiful and the singers do quite a good job at it, despite the physical challenges with the stairs and running all over the place. I guess we will have to wait for a better DVD release.",1295308800,14,1329,4.450819672131147
8348581,2,B0020MSTAY,"Peter Sellar's staging of Mozart's Zaide has got to be one of the ugliest stagings I have ever seen.  I have seen amateur productions with better sets and costumes.  You are better off buying an audio version of this opera than buying this video.

On the other hand, Mozart's music is sublime.",1253059200,13,293,4.596153846153846
