4887194,5,B005STRK4W,"The kettles were shown at the movies when I was a little girl and I have seen them all.  Still love them and have purchased all of them twice from Amazon as I gave one set to my daughter-in-law. Decent to watch with the family, no sex, no blasphemy, no cursing.  Even though Pa kettle was lazy, he was honest.  I gave them five stars but would gladly have given them a ten if that was an option.",1348617600,17,395,4.038461538461538
4887195,5,B005STRK4W,"When I was young, I watched Ma and Pa Kettle on Sunday mornings. They were so funny. I was raised on a farm with 4 brothers and 4 sisters so I could somewhat relate to the situation they were in. I really enjoyed watching these shows.",1336262400,12,234,4.108695652173913

4887207,3,B005STRK4W,"I  guess my tastes have changed over the years. Loved them 30 years ago but will be nice to have around when the mood strikes. More into Sci Fi now and Fantasy and Drama shows but to fans of Ma and Pa Kettle, you will like the collection. Some of the movies, they are just being introduced.",1395964800,,290,4.087719298245614
4887208,5,B005STRK4W,"I would recommend  these movies to anyone who enjoys old movies.
The humour of these movies is from a bygone era without swearing or smut. They are just thoroughly enjoyable.",1381622400,3,174,4.8
4887209,5,B005STRK4W,Filled to the brim with stereotype silliness. Sorry! Still funny. It can't be helped. They knew when they were making them but it was not yet frowned upon.,1377475200,5,155,4.571428571428571

4887211,3,B005STRK4W,"I am fan of the ""Kettle"" movies and own the first eight movies released on earlier DVDs. When I ran across these additional Kettle movies I wanted them to complete my collection. But in these two movies Percy Kilbride, the original Pa Kettle is absent and the children are different. The producers attempted to work around Pa being absent and the original children aging out, but the movies just don't have the same chemistry as before. I will keep the movies, but they aren't the best of the Kettle series.",1373673600,8,507,4.644444444444445
4887212,3,B005STRK4W,"I purchased this to (I thought) complete my set of movies of Ma & Pa Kettle.

Although entertaining, the movies without Pa just had too much missing.  I suppose that is why they weren't included in the 2 boxed sets.",1373414400,8,215,4.35
4887213,4,B005STRK4W,I have all of the Kettle films and this set completes the series....just wish that there were more to add to my collection.,1366761600,3,123,4.391304347826087
4887214,5,B005STRK4W,"This was the last movies I needed to complete my collection. I love these movies and they bring back so many good memories of mindless television, sitting with my grandma and watching these . Even if you have never heard of these people or seen any of the movies they are priceless. Pa is the laziest person you've ever seen and Ma has all these kids. it just Hilarious! , they are classics!",1358467200,11,391,4.36986301369863
