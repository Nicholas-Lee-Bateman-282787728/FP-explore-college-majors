8285622,2,B001C0I5YU,Mediocre presentation at best. A DVD titled A History of the Electric Guitar should contain some timeline of history.,1240099200,,117,5.2105263157894735
8285623,3,B001C0I5YU,"I was looking for a DVD to show young children the history of the electric guitar.  While the information presented is interesting, there are too many interviews.  It was difficult for me to sit and watch the entire DVD.  I had to break it up into several sittings.  I'm not sure how this could have been made more interesting.  Perhaps less dialogue and interviewing would work.",1237852800,,379,4.681818181818182
8285624,5,B001C0I5YU,"Rock, popular, jazz and country music lovers in general -- and musicians who play those genres in particular -- will enjoy this in-depth look at the key instrument behind them all. Touching and revealing interviews with renowned guitarists are mixed with archival footage of guitar greats -- some well known, some obscure but influential nonetheless -- and with behind-the-scenes tours and histories of the Gibson, Fender and Rickenbacker manufacturing facilities. It's thorough, well-paced and well-organized and warrants repeated viewings.",1229904000,2,541,5.860759493670886
8285625,5,B001C0I5YU,"This extremely well done - and entertaining - documentary takes the electric guitar back to it's roots with pioneers like Charlie Christian, who brought the electric guitar into big jazz bands but is at its best when covering the ""heyday"" of the 1950s and 1960s whith the dawn of Rock and Roll. Les Paul is, obviously, prominently featured in interviews, but folks like James Burton, Steve Cropper, Scotty Moore and the rarely interviewed Duane Eddy are here, coordinated with some great archival film footage. There are interviews with guitar collectors and representatives of the various manufacturers (Fender, Rickenbacker) too. The chapters are chronological but also divided into the style of the guitar (Telegaster, Stratocaster, the Les Paul model).

I don't play any instruments, let alone a guitar but, as a fan of most musical styles, I was riveted to the TV screen throughout the whole show. The bonus features include six sections. ""The Studio"" is a wonderful inside look in how working as a ""studio musician"" vs being on stage is different. Cropper, Burton and Glen Campbell are really insightful here. Wait'll you hear Campbell's story of playing on Sinatra's ""Strangers in the Night""!
The sections on ""Collecting Vintage Guitars"" and ""For Guitar Players Only"" with REALLY appear to those interested in the technical aspects of the instrument. ""Meets The Beatles"" tell the brief story of the Rickenbacker company making Paul McCartney's guitar, while ""The Lost Banjo"" has the Beatles' former chauffer, Alf Bicknell, telling a short story. The features end with an under-a-minute comment on guitars from Bo Diddley.

This DVD is well worth seeking out. And if you have, and play, an electric guitar you will not want to miss seeing it.

8285626,5,B001C0I5YU,"We watched the entire 155 minute main feature in one sitting and when it was over we couldn't believe it--I guess time flies when you're having fun!  Lots of well-paced and interesting historical information and interviews-- our attention never wavered.  Cool both for musicians as well as anyone who loves the best in guitar-oriented music from the 50's, 60's and 70's.

8285627,5,B001C0I5YU,"Riveting! This documentary is awesome. It's first one I've seen that isn't about Rock `n Roll itself or about a particular artist. It's about the electric guitar - about Fenders, Gibsons, Gretschs, Rickenbackers and more. The guitars are familiar to all of us in the same way that Chevys and Fords are. They are part of our culture; part of who we are as baby boomers. You don't have to be a musician to appreciate this. Most of the artists describe that moment so many of us have experienced - seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan in 1964 - opening the big box under the Christmas Tree in 1965, then disappearing into the bedroom to work out the lead solo to ""Gloria"" - starting a band in the 8th grade and KNOWING this is what you want to do the rest of your life.... They talk about something I have been so interested in - they talk about THEIR stuff, and how they first became smitten with music and these oh so sexy electric guitars. The interviews are fascinating; the presentation flows so well from recent interview to vintage clip and back again. Awesome job, Kent Hagen !!",1226880000,2,1080,4.459595959595959
8285628,4,B001C0I5YU,"Caught a sneak peek of this documentary at a film festival in Boston last week, and must say I was thoroughly entertained. I'm not a guitar player myself, but enjoyed it all the same. Was especially cool seeing such a variety of famous guitar players (Bo Diddley, Slash, and my fav--Steve Jones from the Sex Pistols)  talking about the people and music that inspired them to pick up the electric guitar. Was informative, with segments devoted to the various guitar types (Les Paul, Gretch, Rickenbacker, etc.)  Would have liked to see a bit more concert footage, but was a good documentary overall.",1222732800,5,598,4.852941176470588
