7365925,5,B013I9RK4I,"This is the movie version of a popular Japanese television series that spanned three years.  If you are a fan of Japanese dramas, you will know that a three year series is unusual unless it is very popular.  The series was also remade as a Korean series as well.

It is about a restauranteur who only opens from midnight to 7:00 am, hence the name, the Midnight Diner.  During these late night hours, numerous odd but charismatic characters come in with their problems.

This is an excellent movie.  The only issue is that some of the subtitles were not correctly translated by the Chinese distributor.  Luckily, it is not that much of an issue.",1466899200,5,645,4.605263157894737

8727846,5,B013I9RK4I,"This movie is based on the long-running Japanese TV series by the same name, Shinya Shokudo (Midnight Diner), featuring the same cast of characters.

The traditional Japanese eatery (Izakaya) in a narrow alley in Tokyo is run by the Master (Kaoru Kobayashi), a man with a natural touch for mending broken souls and relationships. Inside the establishment, we meet regulars like Ryu Kenzaki (Yutaka Matsushige), a stern-faced gang boss; Marilyn (Tamae Ando), a dimpled strip tease dancer; and Kogure (Joe Odagiri), the charming neighborhood cop. In this 2014 movie version, we also meet Tamako Kawashima (Saki Takaoka), the lovely mistress of a businessman; Michiru Kuriyama (Mikako Tabe), a homeless girl with a hidden talent for cooking; and Kenzo Oishi (Michitaka Tsutsui), a man who lost his wife in a tsunami. By cooking up meals that stir up memories, and by taking a chance on strangers, the Master manages to give his patrons hope, salvation, and humanity.

The vignettes in the movie show how little it takes to change people's life for the better, and how everyone is hiding invisible wounds. The human drama is all the more delicious because it's served over warm sake, graded yam over rice, hot Soba noodles, and Tamagoyaki (omelet roll).",1501718400,2,1249,5.087804878048781

8727849,5,B013I9RK4I,"This is movie version of the weekly Japanese TV series by the same name.  You can find at least one season of it in the US on streaming media.  Do a browser search for it and try a couple of episodes first.  If you like the series format and become familiar with it first, this disc will be more familiar. Be aware that there is also a Korean TV series based on the Japanese -it's OK but not the same (a least for an English speaking viewer) so get the Japanese version.

The stories are quiet, amusing and sometimes sad.  But mostly subtle.  Each leaves a smile on your face. Hollywood might have been able to mahe make something comparable 50+ years ago but not today.",1488326400,2,670,4.277777777777778
8727850,5,B013I9RK4I,"I saw the series on Netflix.  I thought the series was well done and very engaging.  I liked the human interaction and recipes for the food featured.  I thought the ending was very sad, but I will not give spoilers.",1483833600,,215,4.325
8727851,5,B013I9RK4I,"If you've seen the Japanese series on Netflix or online elsewhere, you know what you're getting. This is a wonderful show about people caring about each other in various ways. The movie is 100% loyal to the series. You know immediately from the opening silent seconds.",1482364800,3,268,4.8478260869565215
8727852,5,B013I9RK4I,"I was on my way back to Taiwan for my sister's funeral. On the JAL flight was one of these movies that I took a chance to watch. Amongst other choices of famous Hollywood was this movie. I watched almost twice and recommend it to my sister-in-law, and friends and post it on my own Facebook

Sure, this is not a big time movie nor it has the resources like other directors. Nevertheless, the best way about acting are the actors and the story. It is about a god forsaken place, if you will, in a simple and plain old Japan that illustrates the life of modern Japan and elevates the humanity in it. Themes of love and lost, job and fortunate seekers in a big city, three lovely Japanese ladies, a homeless kid, a food critic, a beautiful stripper, late night workers, a gold digger, a god forsaken urn and a funeral for a famous singer (not in the movie).

I would highly recommend this movie, for it is like the episode 'Butter Rice' (episode 4) It is tasteless to those who do not miss the simple an every day diet. Yet the taste is lasting and it brings back memories of our most precious and profound sense of enduring humanity, I dare say, in all of us.

For that reason, I highly recommend it. Having had the fortune to live abroad, tasted fine food else where, but I come back to taste simple street food. It's popular and it's simplicity is what I look for. For me, these are priceless, and invaluable.",1479168000,4,1409,4.329545454545454
