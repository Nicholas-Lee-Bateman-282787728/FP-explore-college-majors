7990861,1,B00009K7EF,This is not what they say it is.  It is training only for using radar.  Nothing else was covered.  I feel shorted on this DVD base on how they described its contents.,1413158400,,166,4.125
7990862,1,B00009K7EF,"In this video: a) the resolution is too poor to see any of the radar screen soft key labels; b)the demonstrator turns knobs the opposite direction from the narrator's instructions; c) when adjusting gain and filters nothing visible occurs on the screen to give the viewer feedback; d) the demonstrator touches the wrong key/knob and the finger walks to the correct one.

The video does not cover the ARPA function, but this is not revealed on the box.  Altogether a waste.  Money would have been better spent on lunch for a Furuno dealer.",1098921600,2,538,4.763440860215054
