This is one of the very few dvds I've seen which clearly communicate that playing the blues is NOT about licks or 'playing like', but rather it is about conveying an outlook with your own genuine feeling.  If it's yours, it's real.",1246924800,5,387,4.485714285714286
8129377,5,B000G8NVP2,"Having just received this today and only watched the first disc I'm only really reviewing that. What i can say however is that it is almost like having your insanely talented best friend over to teach you some licks,The way this is presented you get the feeling Doug genuinely wants you to improve your playing and presents this in a very informal yet informative way.if you're looking to improve your understanding of accoustic blues and give you another way of thinking about what to play GET THIS.",1215561600,5,500,4.758620689655173
