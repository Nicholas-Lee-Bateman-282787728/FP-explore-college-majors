5978703,5,B00FE5N09Y,"Brilliant series and a quality box set, I really like it. Honestly the only disappointing thing about this box set is the reveal of what the Pineapple is. It was the most disappointing thing since my birth, do not buy it solely to reveal the meaning of the Pineapple.",1523836800,,267,4.469387755102041

Ten individually wrapped DVDs in a box that does not showcase the DVD titles. If the box had been more of a bookcase shape, which seems like an easy fix, it would have been much better.

5978741,1,B00FE5N09Y,"The show is great, but the packaging is terrible. My husband got this for me for Valentines Day since Netflix dropped the series last year. Every-single disc is glued into the cardboard sleeves they came in. The only way to remove them is ripping the sleeve. I spent an hour cleaning the sticky goo off the first season with alcohol and a cotton swab, and the discs play fine, but very disappointed in the packaging. Not worth the hassle. The box is also an awkward size besides the bad design of the folders that fit the disks.",1520035200,3,528,4.453608247422681
5978742,5,B00FE5N09Y,I purchased this and then I read the reviews. I was quite nervous after reading all the negative packaging reviews but that appears to have been fixed. Each season and the bonus disc all had their own plastic regular DVD case. The box the dad's came in is beautiful. I love the series and it was worth every cent.,1519084800,7,313,4.322033898305085

5978750,4,B00FE5N09Y,"Waited to buy this because of the glue issue. Was thrilled to not only see new packaging but on sale too so grabbed it. The good news is, the glue issue has been fixed. The bad news is, its just been replaced with a new problem. Ive only opened 4 cases so far and in all of them, the plastic tab holding the discs in place is broken in the bottom corner. Fixable with super glue but still irritating.
I loved finding out the secret of the pineapple incident but I don't get why it wasn't aired. Its just a 20 second scene in the last season that was deleted, which was silly because it would have been cool to solve that mystery at the end.
I have noticed that soundtracks differ between TV and disc versions of shows and thats true here too. Ive watched this on Netflix and Hulu so many times that I know what background song is coming when, but some are different on the discs. Same with some scenes, if youve memorized the TV versions youll catch a few small differences here and there.
The show is my favorite of all time and Im so happy to finally own the discs with bonus features like gag reels and cast interviews!
Keep trying with the packaging though. Photo included........",1515974400,,1184,4.313901345291479

One of these discs didn't even work and the other barely works. All of the discs in this box set are widescreen except for seasons 1, 8, and 9 which are fullscreen. Why is this not consistent??

5978763,2,B00FE5N09Y,Packaging was bent and corners crushed. The DVD cases are cheap and the printed design is from a poor quality printer. Very disappointing- the entire thing looks counterfeit and I certainly can't give this as a gift as I intended to,1513209600,,232,4.682926829268292

5978765,5,B00FE5N09Y,"I was a bit nervous about all of the glue, glue, glue reviews but I am happy to report that I opened every DVD and there was NOT a drop of glue anywhere to be found! Actually every DVD was in pristine condition except literally the first and last DVD that I examined. Season 5 DVD1 and Season 6 DVD1 both were secure in their case so the circular rub mark on each DVD could not have happened during shipping.

5978768,1,B00FE5N09Y,"The packaging for this dvd set is HORRIBLE. The discs are just placed in these spots where there is all this glue that is trying to hold the paper down around the discs. The glue didn't hold up and now I have glue on almost every disc in the set. Its horrible. I watched it all years ago when I bought this, and now a few years later I took it out last night, and I cannot watch it. Its too bad  I can't return this, but I want to tell everyone DO NOT BUY THIS SET. YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! I am so disappointed. I bought this years ago so I could watch it always, now I can't. Awful....",1510531200,2,596,3.925619834710744

5978789,4,B00FE5N09Y,"I ordered this set because I wanted all seasons contained in a single package. Instead I received 9 separate dvd cases. It's like they ran out of the fancy case and just gave me the individual seasons. Based on complaints I've seen about disc storage, it might work out better this way, but still. I don't appreciate getting something other than what I ordered. ....I tried adding photo of what I got but app isn't letting me",1501891200,4,425,4.532467532467533

5978801,4,B00FE5N09Y,"This is probably my favorite series of all time, so I LOVE the story.  However, the case is very strange.  It opens like a book, and to get the disks out, the cover has to be open all the way or more, and they fit so tightly.  It's really cute, but difficult to get out and put back in. It's also difficult to see which season is which if you don't put them back exactly the way they were, because you don't see the long edge by looking into the box.",1498953600,,450,3.923076923076923

5978808,1,B00FE5N09Y,"Okay, did not buy this product from Amazon? No but I did buy it elsewhere. The set is exactly what I wanted. All episodes, extra bonus material, ect. But the quality of the product itself is way cheap. I feel like I ordered a bunch of recycled paper. The back of the case has flimsy what seems to be glued on paper(ripped the first day). The cases that hold the disk are thin and also quite flimsy. Really Fox? Other then that it's got everything described. And the bonus disk is awesome! ""High five!"" Material is bro code approved. Not a 5-star product to me the greatest show ever deserves so much better of a box set and this one needs to be $30 cheaper!",1493164800,,657,4.264
5978809,5,B00FE5N09Y,This was perfect. Each of the seasons has their own little case that fits inside the large book case. It is way larger than a normal DVD season case.

No glue on cd's and they play with NO skipping or errors so far. Great product for the price.  Season  5 had an add on it. Shouldn't have that. That's why I HATE buying DVD's. Why put an add on of something that won't be around soon. Keep to the movie at hand manufactures.,1484524800,,433,4.08235294117647
5978871,2,B00FE5N09Y,"The packaging design is poor. They created it to look like a book and inside are nine small cardboard folders floating around the box, discs fall out and in my case one disc is missing.

Not only is this frustrating but it makes storing the set difficult. I find it impossible to locate the ""contact Amazon"" link so telling them is VERY difficult but more so, the hassle involved with returning this monster is beyond my physical abilities. (I have GBS).

This does have a ""play all"" funnction but you cannot repeat the entire disc; a factor which is important to me.

The commentaries-of which there are many-are like eavesdropping on a personal viewing party; nothing is said.

This is an expensive disappointment.",1484006400,,716,4.796747967479675

5978876,1,B00FE5N09Y,"Received as a Christmas gift from my girlfriend. The packaging is horrendous. Like so many others, the DVDs have glue on them, and attempts to remove the adhesive are causing scratches. Every single disc is glued to the packaging. All my photos are purposely showing the case upside-down to illustrate this. This is incredibly poorly designed and manufactured. Either the set all the DVDs on the back covers, sprayed glue, it hit a bump on the belt, then they placed the top piece on... or they were all stored in an un-airconditioned warehouse in the middle of the desert.

5978880,4,B00FE5N09Y,"I won't get into the series as much as I will the packaging. If you're looking at the Complete Series on DVD.. you've probably seen the show. It's one of the best written comedies in recent years no question with some of the best recurring jokes I've seen in a show. The characters are well thought out, hilarious in their own way, and fit together perfectly with the others. I've watched this show 3092348 times on Netflix but with shows I like constantly coming off, I decided to play it safe and buy the collections of my favorite shows so I don't stress about it.

Now the packaging, this is my letdown. Buying this was much cheaper than buying the seasons separately, but I kind of wish I took that route anyways. The package is HUGE (lol). It's meant to look like the playbook from the show it seems and it's way too tall to fit on any of me media shelves. I ended up laying it flat on the top where I can barely reach since it's the only place I could put it. You'll open it up and each season is in a pretty flimsy cardboard packaging with some pictures and the episode guide. These aren't awful but with the package being tall, it's almost better to lay it flat because of the way each season is stuffed in there. The problem with the glue and ruined discs reviews have mentioned is a non-issue anymore, the company fixed it and all my DVD's were fine.

With that said, if you have the money and don't mind, I recommend buying the seasons separately, but if there's a deal like there was when I bought this, the packaging sucks, but at least I own them all in case Netflix decides to break my heard again.",1482192000,7,1614,4.288524590163934

5978883,1,B00FE5N09Y,"Apparently, the glue problem is NOT fixed because many of the DVDs were stuck to the packaging because of the adhesive AND they either skipped, froze, or didn't play at all. I loved the series and the packaging concept, but they should have mixed it up with card-stock covers and plastic disc holders or using the multi-disc, plastic cases. Instead they were greedy and just went the cheaper way. I'm returning the set I bought, but am concerned that a replacement wouldn't be any better? This was a gift and looked so cool! I was really excited to give it to my daughter and instead, we were both very disappointed.

My only complaint is the way the discs are packaged. Each session season is in a folded cardboard ""book"", and sometimes it's a bit of work getting them back into the box that holds them all. They just don't seem to fit very nicely. I will more than likely put them in a CD book but will still display the box they came in (I really like the appearance of it).

I did not read any reviews before I ordered it but the problem I had wasn't really listed here. there wasn't glue all over but the discs where all randomized and some where loose in the box but none of them appeared scratched up at all so I figured no harm no foul. we watched season one no problem but on season two a couple episodes in the disc starts skipping and will not continue to play I tried going to another episode but it froze and would not play. there is no visible damage to the disc at all so I tried another and another and same thing. I switched between our blue ray and dvd players thinking that was the problem. the big box that all the discs come in has a big magnetic strip that keeps it closed. MAGNETS and DVDs do not get along. this is the only explanation I can come up with as to why all of seasons 2-4 will not play right. they are on the top closest to the magnetic seal that latches the box closed.,1455235200,3,1026,4.009756097560976

5979000,4,B00FE5N09Y,"I was happy to get a good deal on this complete series set during a recent Deal of the Day sale. HIMYM was one of the funniest shows on television during its nine season run. However, the packaging of this set is less than legendary. The case is basically a box holding nine cardboard folders, one for each season. The individual discs are in slots inside the folders. Problem is, the way the folders are made - they don't actually fit neatly into the case. I ended up purchasing some paper disc sleeves and putting the discs in those. While doing that I checked the discs for any damage and to besure that they were all there - I didn't find any problems.",1452124800,3,656,4.341463414634147

5979002,1,B00FE5N09Y,"I don't know how I didn't see all the other reviews commenting on the packaging. Worth the extra money to get each season individually to have REAL cases and episode directions. Do NOT get this unless you absolutely require the extra bonus disc.

1. Why do complete series sets have to use the stupid cardboard sleeve method of holding dvds? Terrible.

2. You can't see what season you are pulling out. You need to pull them all out basically to get what you want, and it's very difficult to pull them out without using gravity to help you, and in doing so, dvds start falling out of the stupid sleeves. Stupid design.

3. The season sleeves are VERY hard to put back into the box. It is a tight fit. They're all bent in different directions. Horrible.

4. No book or sheet or anything with episode numbers or descriptions. Just a list of the episodes on the front of each cardboard sleeve. Lazy.

I'm going to try to return and buy each season individually. Stupid stupid stupid. And I am a complete idiot for purchasing this. Don't be as stupid as me =P",1451952000,4,1055,4.44559585492228

I wasn't overly excited to see there was a box set but the design of it and that bonus disc explaining the pineapple incident really hooked me!  Saw there was some glue issues, blah blah blah...  all seemed to be taken care of.  So I saw a good deal and ordered it.

Just opened it and let's be honest.  You messed up on the package design.  It is awful in so many ways.  I understand what people mean by not being able to see what season you are pulling out.  It was made nearly impossible to know what season you are grabbing without pulling it out.  I had to take each season out individually to make sure discs hadn't come loose and I had to bend each season case so it properly sat in the box.  The individual cases are flimsy and just sad.  I wish this was better put together.  This was a poor attempt at something that should have been great.

Positive note...  No glue issue noticed so far.",1449446400,6,977,4.144385026737968

5979050,5,B00FE5N09Y,"I wanted this set from the first time I saw it as a preorder, but then the reviews starting pouring in about the poor packaging and glue on the discs.  I already had all the individual season releases, so I waited a few months to order.  By then, the packaging problems seemed to have been fixed.  I examined every single disc and there's not a single scratch or any glue on any disc in my set.

As for the show itself, I watch it nearly every day when it's on cable channels, even though I own this set.  So many episodes make callbacks to things that happened several seasons ago, or briefly mention something that will be shown in the future, that you really have to pay attention and watch the episodes multiple times to get the most enjoyment out of them. It really reminds me of the Back To The Future trilogy in that the more you watch it, the more inside jokes you catch on to, and the funnier it gets.

I really loved the mother character in the final season.  I would have liked another season that focused more on her.  Yes some people hated the ending, but it didn't bother me at all.  The series is all about the journey, not the destination.",1447977600,4,1155,4.285714285714286

Just as many reviewers have stated, this dvd set could be packaged better. As soon as I opened the box set, I saw that the dvd cases were out of place and loose CD's at the bottom of the box. Upon inspection, I was fortunate enough - not to have any damage disks. Looking closely at the dvd cases I noticed that the disk weren't secured in their pockets, due to the fact that the disks were only held by a portion of a pocket follow by folded sides to divide each disk per season. As you can see in my picture you'll find that the sides of each pocket has enough room for disks to slide back and forth, which would explain how shipping products like this would damage most disks.

Although I was a little disappointed in this box set, I decided to improvise - to secure the disks I managed to find an old CD carrying case and placed all my disks inside and inserted the entire case within the box set.",1441929600,8,1042,4.12807881773399

5979119,1,B00FE5N09Y,"This review is one star not because of the show - which is excellent and why I am so disappointed.  It is more a reflection on Amazon. First, the product details state languages: English, Spanish etc with corresponding Dolby Audio formats and next to subtitles they state the different language subtitles available.  This to me implies that the audio available with the product is in English, Spanish etc..that's why they went through the trouble to list the corresponding Dolby sound format with each audio - correct?  WRONG!  Not only does the product box only list English as the audio but when you play the disc English is the only audio period.  The DVD only allows you to choose the subtitle language and the disc player only detects English as the only audio track available.  When I called Amazon to ask if they could see if the product was either mistakenly described or perhaps I was shipped the wrong item they, while very friendly throughout, seemed predisposed to simply issuing a return and refund than contacting their logistics to confirm one way or the other and make an attempt to see if they could SATISFY their customers original want.  Instead I was told while they could ask their warehouse to look into it, their warehouse would never respond to them or to me..?? I thought this was Amazon and that part of their core competency and strength was logistics!  In the end I just returned it for a refund",1426204800,4,1423,4.709677419354839

I love how it actually looks like a big book and the quotes that in each of the season's cases.  My only complaint is how the seasons are set up.  You can't just grab the season you want because you can't tell what you're grabbing.  I think it should have been set up like you're turning the page for each disc to make it even more like a ""book.""  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.",1423958400,2,546,4.10377358490566

Have exactly THE SAME PROBLEM IN THE SAME SEASONS!!!!!!! So I've lost again my husband's gift and of course I don't want it any more.

I was weary because of the comments about the DVDs being ruined but this was not the case.  We did have to exhange it once because season eight was missing but no questions asked after it was explained and we got the new one two days after. Return label provided and UPS pick up.
Anyways the show is good to my husband it is epic . this made his Christmas and we have watched the whole show again. The pineapple mystery and the alternate ending. Extras and commentary are funny and other special features.  The DVDs were in good shape we love the sleeves it is a tight fit in the set but it is okay manageable. I would buy it again if I knew it'd be okay so if you are wanting to buy it get it.  Maybe amazon got a new batch in or people ordered when it was crazy hot ?

The presentation of the box was too perfect to open so I kept it on display. I recently stumbled upon this item again on the site and noticed the ""Under Item Review"" warning which got me curious so I read all the comments. Upon further review, I immediately opened my DVD set and noticed most of the dvd's difficult to remove.. Once removed, the dvd's were damaged with the glue for packaging purposes. Is it too late to even get a refund or even get a new set since this released in September? The idea for the packaging was very clever, but the way it was crafted just ruined the entire set.",1420848000,3,703,4.253731343283582

It is cumbersome, and with use, I'm sure the top flap will be easily damaged or just tear off. I am only half way through the series, but so far the DVDs from the various seasons seem to have been produced by completely different people; there is no consistency as to form. I also have found glue or some other sticky substance on two DVDs thus far. It was easy to clean off, but still. Having said all that, the DVDs play just fine.",1420761600,,520,4.21

There was some white looking stuff around some of the very edges, but it easily rubbed off and had no impact on how it played. 4 stars because I LOVE the series, I love the playbook box, and all the discs played perfectly. 1/2 a star off because it wasn't available in blu-ray and another 1/2 star off for not having more/better extra features. I love extras and am always disappointed when there aren't more of them on a big box set like this one.

My favorite extra feature was the alternate ending and being able to play the whole last episode with it instead of just having it as an extra/deleted scene. So in a way you can choose how the whole series ends.",1419724800,,777,4.214765100671141

I do like this series a lot and for fans of sitcoms and romantic comedies, it's a must-watch.  I waited until after the glue issue was resolved with the packaging, and I'm pleased to report my DVDs arrived in fine shape and they all play with no issues.  I'm not crazy about the packaging overall, because the large box is huge and won't fit on a normal DVD shelf.  However you can take the seasons out and store them separately from the large box.  I do wish the folios for the individual seasons were a harder cardboard or even plastic like normal DVD cases, but I know they are trying to conserve space.  Each season takes up about the same shelf space as a single DVD case.  Would have loved to see this released on Blu-Ray but I don't think that is going to happen.

Tip I used they glued in some extra guard border to help keep the disc cases in I ripped it out and it makes getting the discs in and out much easier.

5979310,4,B00FE5N09Y,"Just wanted to post another review to confirm that the problems with the box set packaging (namely, the glue) seem to have been fixed! No glue on any of the discs in mine and they were all playable. Also, I'm super excited to check out the bonus disc, which I've heard good things about, and of course the show itself is (in general) very good.

But with all that being said, I did take off one star because when the set arrived, one of the discs had a scratch from what looked like somebody slicing open a box copies of the season had been stored in before putting all the seasons together in the box set, and scratching through the cover of the season to scratch the disc itself a bit. I was able to buff the scratch out (with a microfiber cloth and stuff) enough that the disc played without any issues, but it ideally would've been nice if I didn't have to do that in the first place. Also even though the glue issue has been fixed, the individual seasons are still in those wallet type cases which I've never been a fan of in any box set, and the wallet cases still come in a tightly packed ""bro code"" box, so it can be a bit hard/slightly inconvenient to get the seasons in and out of the box.

These two things were a bit annoying, but were not deal breakers for me, since overall every disc in the set is playable, the set comes with some good bonus features, and I was able to get it for a steal when Amazon had it on sale for a price that calculated out to about $7.00 per season, which was awesome. Don't let the past negative reviews scare you!

The DVDs are 3 discs per season (except the last season has a bonus disc). Each season is packaged in what reminds me of wallet style case. You slide the disc out of a sleeve or pouch within the panels. Sadly, no plastic trays or cases to snap the discs into.

Having said that I will elaborate on the reasoning behind it...the humor is beyond atrocious throughout the entire series...how this lasted one season, let alone even got past the pilot pitched to networks will forever remain a mystery. No matter how hard you try, you will not be able to stomach even one episode of this garbage. There is some great modern comedies on TV but this is sure NOT one of them. If you want to laugh check out classic sitcoms such as Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond and as for a modern comedy highly recommend the critically acclaimed It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Now if you for some reason want to be in absolute misery watch this, if you have any self respect or intelligence though stay very far away from this, the same goes for pop music, just stay away from it.",1416614400,5,846,4.6466666666666665

Each season is in its own little cardboard sleeves. These sleeves are tightly packed, and mine had been bent in the box, which makes it very difficult to take them in and put them out. Almost every single disc also slipped down in their respective sleeves. The issue with this is there is sticky glue-like substance that holds these sleeves together. This substance got on every single disc that slipped. It is incredibly difficult to get off the discs, and the discs refuse to play unless all it is off. It was a noble idea, and is neat to look at, but it is just not a smart buy.

Having had to dig a deep hole and keep myself in it since the series ended its TV run, and then re-watching it all in a short period of time, the ending that they chose really does make sense from a story-teller's perspective. It's just so typically Ted.

Packing would have been perfect if it weren't for the fact that the dvds some how sank down into the glue they used to keep the dvds in their jackets. Some of the glue event stuck onto the DVDs, which was vexing because they'd jam the dvd player unless you spent some time scraping the stuff off.

5979370,5,B00FE5N09Y,"I discovered How I Met Your Mother at the very beginning. In 2005 television and I didn't have as tight of a relationship as we used to. That was because the concept of the sitcom was practically on death's door and reality shows had taken over the networks. Unless you liked what cable had to offer there really was nothing and I was craving the old days of prime time sitcom bliss.

When I saw that this show was coming out and saw that it stared Neil Patrick Harris and Alyson Hannigan, there had to be some potential. After seeing the pilot I was hooked and while I really was unable to watch the show on the days it air, it did not stop me from purchasing the seasons on DVD.

This show was wonderful I related to the characters and saw a lot of myself in Ted Mosby. A guy with a good heart who is looking for the one and just enjoying life through its ups and downs with his friends. The supporting cast is a riot, as it was a bunch of adults who still wanted to clutch to their fondest points of their youth. Neil Patrick Harris really is the best part of the show and I admire how a proud openly gay man can play an over the top straight man perfectly. This show really contains a little bit of everything and even though the final season got a lot of smack, when the show ends (whether you like the ending or not) The show really puts the whole 9 year run into perspective.

Thanks to this show the sitcom has been revived and now some of the best shows in years can be seen on the regular networks once again. How I Met Your Mother was near and dear to my heart and I will be able to cherish and share it forever.",1411689600,,1623,4.081504702194358

If you look at the low ratings, you'll see that they are made up of people who have actually purchased this thing, and they are all due to the packing. The packaging is, in a word, horrible. The seasons are all packaged individually in cardboard sleeves (which I already wasn't terribly excited about), and the sleeves bleed glue on to the discs which is impossible to remove and damages the DVD to the point where they skip or won't even read.

I remember reading similar issues with the first box set of the Friends series; DVDs in cardboard-like envelopes instead of sturdy DVD cases.  I opened it to discover 1) you shouldn't actually open it like a book because some of the DVDs will fall out (open with the spine up) and 2) I have to squeeze my fingers between the cardboard envelopes in order to pull out a season.  The disc I decided to play was not scratched, but I wouldn't be surprised if I find some damaged discs later.

It was a very well written story as a whole and looking back and re watching episodes on netflix I could see the ending as being appropriate.  I had one Major Problem with this particular set and it has nothing to do witht he show.  The DVD packing is just plain stupid, each one of the DVDs was basically stuck in their Sleeves by glue I guess and they were a pain to remove. Some of the DVDs skip because of how much sticky glue was on the DVD, I would replace the series with Amazon but I am not sure if another set will come just like that.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Please comment if you have any ideas.

5979386,3,B00FE5N09Y,"Why no Blu-ray release, Fox? This is one of the most successful sitcoms of the past decade. It's a huge success. The season 4 Blu-ray barely sold compared to the DVD edition because of two reasons: 1) At the time, there were not as many adopters of the format, and 2) because the rest of the series was only released on DVD. A LOT of people only buy shows on Blu-ray if they know they can get the rest released that way.

Look at the Blu-ray releases from Warner Bros of The Big Bang Theory. They considered stopping issuing those at one point as they started releasing them later in the run. Then they decided instead to go back and release the earlier seasons. Now it's clear that all of the seasons sell well on Blu-ray. The same would hold true for a show as popular as HIMYM.

Fox should spend the time to go back and press discs for the entire show in HD. Leaving a show that was filmed entirely in High Definition only on DVD isn't cutting it, and digital download options don't cut it either, both for quality and for permanence of  having a physical copy, which is always preferable.",1410480000,2,1092,4.3431372549019605

The entire series was shot in HD, so there's really no excuse to not have a blu-ray set.

5979392,3,B00FE5N09Y,"While I'd prefer for ""The Whole Story"" to be presented in high-definition, that's obviously something not in my control.  It's asking a lot from Fox to suddenly author eight additional seasons worth of material for a box set, potentially making it more expensive than it would need to be.  Allegedly, the show's singular Blu-Ray release (Season 4) sold less than the studio hoped, which partly explains why Fox opted not to make Blu-Ray editions of later seasons as time went on, as well as not revisiting the first three in high-definition.  But what's done is done.  Hopefully, Fox will revisit their (admittedly, premature) decision to not put the rest of the series on Blu-Ray.

In the meantime, if there's one thing they can do for fans, it's present the first season in widescreen.  When Fox first released the DVD eight years ago (has it really been that long?), they unwisely used the 1.33:1 broadcast masters made for SD televisions, essentially a pan and scan of the filmed 1.78:1 widescreen (which was used for HD broadcasts).  Presentation-wise, this makes the first season inconsistent with the rest of the series.  Going from 1.33:1 in the first season (and a pan and scan, at that) to 1.78:1 for subsequent seasons has always been a minor bother for me, especially when I upgraded to an HDTV that made the pan & scan all the more apparent.  I'll settle for a ""Whole Story"" on DVD, but only if it finally allows for the first season to be seen as it was meant to be seen.",1405728000,2,1485,4.680769230769231
