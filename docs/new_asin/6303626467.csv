695769,4,6303626467,"Perhaps, the movie history would tell you that after the successful version of King Kong (1933), its director Merian Cooper produced this filmed verision of Rider Haggard novel.  The music score is the same prolific Max Steiner.  Certainly, 'She' makes an interesting comparison with that classi ape film, but that should not lead you think that this 'She' is just another attempt to cash in on the success of the Kong.  This 1935 'She' has its own merits such as fantastic special effects and designs, which must have inspired the directors like Spielberg.

The Rider Haggard story is changed.  Yes, you got Randolphe Scott's Leo Vincy and his sidekick Holly (Nigel Bruce, who later gets more famous as Dr. Watson alongside with Basil Rathbone).  But here, these seachers of the 'Flame of Eternal Life' includes a woman named Tanya (Helen Mack), and moreover, they head for the north, not south, giving us some terrific effects of avalanches.

Still, the basic point remains the same.  In the city of Kor, as the original story tells, the stern, cold-hearted queen She reigns, and she believes, perhaps tightly, that Leo is meant for her.  She uses any ruthless methods to gain her purpose, and after we are shown some of her icy behaviors, we see the climax scenes, which are still full of impacts.

The film starts conventionally, and the adventures on the ice field may not look exciting to us.  Many 'scenries' are obviously the painted backdrops in soundstages, and the acting from Scott and Helen Gahagan (Broadway singer who later entered politics) are too theatrical for us.

But the final sequences are simply majestic.  The big-scale effects and the production designs of the city are more than impressive even by today's standard, and the ritual dance scenes are curiously arresting, with exotic costumes and very bizarre movements of dancers.  It's very surreal.

Though some parts of the film are dated, the film, probably inspiration for films featuring Indiana Jones and his genre, is still interesting, showing that in 1930s they could show these visual tricks.",1104796800,2,2078,5.0
695770,3,6303626467,"The actor who played She did not seem to portray the she I had in mind. I read this story as a little girl, or rather it was read to me. I remember She being the most beautiful woman on earth. This did not come across in the movie. At lot of illustration and characterization was left out. I did like the campy dance sequence in the movie, very strange and eerie. The music that went with it was ominious and quite effective. The stage sets were quite good, yet the story is taking place in the cold north, rather than Africa. She does convey an icy distance in her stance so I give the actor points for that, yet it is just lacking in story and plot to really hold my attention. Randolph Scott was handsome yet his acting looked very much like acting. I liked Tanya's eyes, they were really sparkly. The threesome, Scott's character, his sidekick, and Tanya, a girl who they met in Antartica, who had been abused by her father, went on a trek to find the eternal flame that bathed you in a mythical fire of youth. When the flame reverses itself the effects are quite good. The avalanches are pretty neat and the chase scenes in the frozen mountain glaciers are fun to watch. All and All not heartily recommended but not to dissuade you either. By all means read the book, it is exceptional.

695771,4,6303626467,"A goofy old-fashioned action film produced by Meriam C. Cooper, the brains behind the1931 smash ""King Kong.""  Randolph Scott stars in this slightly tweaked adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's novel (in the book, the action is set in Africa; here it's in the Antarctic).  Anyway, the basic plot is that a dashing young Anglo-American adventurer heads off in search of a magical fountain of life, but when he arrives at its hidden temple, it turns out the guardian is an immortal hottie (played by Helen Gahagan), who believes that our hero is a reincarnation of her long-lost lover.  The first half of the film is kind of rickety and slow-moving, but once the films starts zipping to its crescendo, things get pretty fun.  There's a big, silly dance number (half modern dance, half Busby Berkeley revue, with kooky ethnic elements), and some really cool special effects -- including a jumping-over-the-chasm scene that may seem familiar to fans of the first ""Lord Of The Rings"" film.  Acting wise, this flick is campy at best -- it's not Scott's best effort (and I  *like*  Randolph Scott!), and Gahagan is kind of a dud; she's just not very convincing as an irresistible(...)-- couldn't they have gotten Bette Davis or Marlene Dietrich instead?  Still, it's a fun film... definitely worth checking out!",1081036800,2,1299,4.926605504587156
695772,4,6303626467,"Ancient papers lead a Cambridge professor and his friends to the lost city where dwells a queen who cannot die - until she falls in love... SHE is alternately hilarious, terrible - and essential viewing for lovers of vintage Sci-Fi flicks! H. Rider Haggard was a British civil servant who began writing to win a bet with his brother after they'd argued about what made good literature. Haggard's works included a prolific 58 works of fiction and 7 works of non-fiction. KING SOLOMON'S MINES was his first novel: his second was SHE which was written in 1887. When adapted for this 1935 flick, the locale was - perhaps mistakenly - altered from the humid wastes of Africa to the frozen wastes of the near-Arctic. The two romantic leads were originally to be played by Joel McCrea and his wife, Frances Dee. Since they proved to be unavailable, the wooden Randolph Scott and the adequate Helen Mack were cast instead. The sometimes hokey script and colourless performances from both Scott and Gahagan tend to mar the film, but not completely: they give the film an unintended campy/eclectic feeling which somehow lingers in the memory rather than offends. The stagey decor of Kor is very Art Deco and reminds one of the Radio City Music Hall & you expect the Rockettes to appear out of nowhere! It is a great relief to film connoisseurs that a print of this movie - which was actually considered lost for years - was found!",1033430400,4,1420,4.706827309236948
695773,4,6303626467,"Just mentioning, that this is not ""She"" with Ursula Andress, as one of the reviewers say; really I find it improbable that Miss Andress was even given birth to at that time. The movie is quite good, but as I have not seen the actual DVD, I am unable to comment on its quality. Since something is required, I'll give... well 4, to be kind.",979516800,3,338,4.2153846153846155
695774,3,6303626467,"The packaging for the DVD boldly announces this film as ""From the Creator of 'King Kong'"" and there are indeed such striking similarities between the two that She--produced by Merian C. Cooper during his tenure at RKO might well have been called Kong Goes North. (Cognoscenti of the earlier film will have no difficulty in spotting the monumental wall with its Babylonian-style gates that separated the inhabitants of Skull Island from the lair of the beast.) Once more a band of intrepid explorers intrude upon the sacred precincts of a ""lost world"" that has been cut off from contact with the outside for centuries--and with predictably disastrous results for all concerned, since the hero turns out to be a reincarnation of the man the immortal mistress of the chthonian realm of Kor had loved five hundred years before. In making King Kong, Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack had drawn upon their earlier documentaries like Grass and Chang, but She, based upon another febrile romance from the pen of H. Rider Haggard (King Solomon's Mines) is a wildly romantic creation that more resembles a Hollywood adaptation of Richard Wagner's Tristan and Isolde than any conventional adventure picture. In fact, what makes She still quite charming today is its highly anachronistic quality, especially evident in the extravagant sets designed by Van Nest Polglase, which hark back to the visual style of classic German films from the early 1920s like Fritz Lang's Destiny as well as Alla Nazimovia's silent version of Oscar Wilde's Salome. I would also surmise that She may have had a influence upon the look of some later movies including Frank Capra's Lost Horizon and Victor Fleming's The Wizard of Oz, and most interestingly of all upon Walt Disney's Snow White, whose evil queen bears a remarkable likeness to the one who rules over Kor.  Helen Gahagan in her unique screen appearance is grandiosely malevolent as She Who Must Be Obeyed--as the movie styles the character. Randolph Scott is quite acceptable as the explorer Leo, and Nigel Bruce his usual solid self as Leo's companion Holly. But Helen Mack is ludicrous as Tanya, the mortal for whom Leo gives up the chance of eternal life, and Gustav Von Seyffertitz as the high priest of Kor is a prototypic example of old-time studio miscasting. As another reviewer pointed out, this DVD has been made from excellent print material and the picture quality is quite impressive, although I personally found the sound level had to be cranked up quite a bit.",979430400,34,2501,4.983253588516747
695775,4,6303626467,"An old used-book store I travel listed several exotic silent and early film classics now thought to be ""Lost"".  This one author went on and on about a weird, halcyon film he'd seen in his childhood called ""She"", with Randolph Scott.  Imagine my pleasure to find that Kino International has just released the DVD of this 1935 fantasy.  Sir H. Rider Haggard's adventure about Ayesha, an ageless queen of a 2000 year-old lost tribe, has been filmed at least 7 times.  There were 5 silent versions(popular,eh?), plus this one, a 1965 MGM re-make with Ursula Andress, and one more sequel by Hammer called ""Vengeance of She"". Archivists tell us the best sound version was in 1935.  This re-telling of the story of ""She-who-must-be-obeyed"" starred Scott, Broadway's lovely Helen Gahagan, Nigel Bruce(remember Dr. Watson?), and pretty Helen Mack(star of Son of Kong). The director was Irving Pichel(an actor in Dracula's Daughter).  it was produced by Merian C. Cooper(from Kong).  A haunting score is provided by Max Steiner.  The film starts slow but builds to a thrilling finish.  Kino uncovered an excellent old 35 mm print, and the sound is excellent. No pops. Pick up this long lost gem, and days later you'll still remember these words...""Young and Beautiful for 500 years. And Wicked every one of them...""",975024000,4,1305,5.00462962962963

An important part of the drama is contrast between the eternally young yet harsh queen seeking a lost love and the other female character in the movie is young and very much in love. The movie sets are beautifully done and most of the effects are well done and integral to the plot.

695984,4,6303626467,"""She"" is an adventure film, but in fact is much more than that appellation might imply. The script deals with the nature of love and the lengths to which that powerful emotion might drive us, and it also explores the way in which ultimate power unfailingly corrupts. Production values are simply exquisite for 1935, and the film still looks better than most similarly-scaled movies of today. Helen Gahagan is very effective as the title character--Ayesha, or She Who Must Be Obeyed--while Randolph Scott is convincing as the movie's protagonist and the object of Ayesha's dubious affections. The gorgeous Helen Mack is Ayesha's rival for Scott's heart, and if her mortal's love lacks the awesome power offered by Ayesha's it is also truer and frankly more human. The climax is tragic but just, and the whole story echoes with the resonance of legend.",1438041600,,850,4.992957746478873

696034,3,6303626467,"""She"" is for anyone who likes old time ""Lost World"" type adventures, in the vein of ""King Kong.""  Two intrepid British explorers dare the frozen tundra of Siberia to find a hidden civilization.  There are some cool Arctic mountain climbing and avalanche scenes, before the explorers are captured by what seems like an ancient Babylonian or Egyptian society that lives in a verdant Shangri-La like valley buried deep beneath the ice, and  worships a thousand year-old woman, played by Helen Gahagan, who is the queen.  She stays young because she has been exposed to some sort of primeval flame caused by a asteroid or some other galactic source that crashed to Earth eons ago.  ""She"" believes that explorer Randolph Scott is the re-incarnation of her long ago lover.

Scott is dashing as always, but it is marvelous to see Nigel Bruce in a more un-Watson like normal role.  The strong point of this movie however, is all the exotic set design that is certain to wow fans of 30's era Flash Gordon serials and Universal Monster classics, etc.  They will be wondering why they never saw this oldie before.",1414972800,5,1102,4.7936507936507935

So, beware if you're renting.  You don't get a choice.  You get the black and white version.  Also, one review mentioned a poor print with wobbling for the first ten minutes.  There is no such problem with this version. Nor does it have sound problems, as mentioned by another review.

Having said all that, the movie is really bad!  I had read that it was nominated for an Academy Award for the dancing scene in the temple, so I was looking forward to it.  ALL the dancing scenes were terrible.  I found myself laughing as I watched them, they were THAT bad!  The dialogue was just as bad, but reminded me that ""talkies"" only started in the late '20's, so dialogue was still relatively new and the writers were still finding their way.  Thank God, Gone With the Wind had better writers!  LOL. Randolph Scott was at his very worst.  I couldn't call his performance acting.  It was more a reciting of his dialogue.

So, I wasted $2.  But I think I probably got $2 worth of laughs out of it.

For instance, SHE was supposed to be the most captivatingly beautiful woman ever with whom every man would fall in love.  However, don't let what is missing from the book deter you from watching what is an excellent yarn.  It was worth watching if for no other reason than seeing the marvelous Art Deco sets.

696147,5,6303626467,"The Deluxe Two-Disc Edition of the 1935 version of She is an excellent product.  It restores the film to its full length, and presents it in the original glorious black and white, plus a new colorized version supervised by Ray Harryhausen.  It also contains a full commentary on the color version by Harryhausen, and has a second disk filled with special features, on everything from the film score and the colorizing process to zoomable advertising materials and still photos.  Fragments of two previous silent versions of She are included, and some oddball features, such as trailers for horror films unrelated to She, and ten minutes of fascinating advertisements for science-oriented children's toys of the late 1950s.

I first saw the 1935 She on late night TV a couple of decades ago, and thought it was a really lousy movie.  I thought it didn't follow the book closely enough, and worse, it was slow-paced, with what struck me at the time as mediocre acting, script, and special effects.  What I didn't know was that parts of the film were at the time lost, and of course TV frequently cuts out parts to make room for commercials, so I was watching a mutilated version of the film, which of course will make the script seem bad.  Also, I was watching on a small TV screen and the print was a bad, murky one.

This edition of the movie completely changed my opinion.  Both the black and white and the colorized versions are restored to full length, and cleaned up.  The black and white, which I recommend watching first, is gorgeous for a 1935 film.  The colorized version is wonderful, not like the awful colorized versions of movies of 15-20 years ago.  The colors are rich, but subtle -- never loud.  And as this film is a fantasy, an adventure, and even a costumer, with some tribal and ritual dancing, and spectacular music, color is what one wants.  With the color, this movie can stand up against much of the fantasy stuff that is churned out today.

The plot departures from the book don't stop the story from being effective on its own terms.  Once one accepts that the movie is almost always going to be different from the book, one can enjoy film versions with a clear conscience.  Helen Gahagan, though in some ways less youthful-looking than a goddess ought to be, has a stern and commanding beauty of her own, and plays She wonderfully, catching both the cruelty and selfishness, and the tenderness and loneliness of the character.  Randolph Scott's performance is adequate, and to the extent that it is a little stiff I would blame the director and scriptwriter as much as Scott.  Helen Mack is excellent as the third part of the love triangle.  The other supporting characters are all adequate, though She's henchmen lean toward film stereotypes, and the script and acting sometimes have a B-movie flavor.  The sets and atmosphere, on the other hand, especially in the colorized version, are truly beautiful and stirring, of A-movie quality.  For sets, music, and Gahagan's performance alone, this film is a must-see of the adventure and the fantasy genres.

The box is handsome, with each disc in its own secure compartment.  The only complaint here is that the tabs, which have an unusual design, are so tight it is hard to get the DVDs out, and once you do get them out, the tabs are loosened and don't seem to have a full grip any longer.  But I think they will hold, and as each DVD is in its own compartment, they can't slide against each other.

It's hard to imagine a better edition of this film.  I could nitpick about the commentary, saying that it spends too much time talking about colorization and not enough time identifying the lesser actors and so on, and that the co-commentator with Harryhausen makes a blunder about how old She is supposed to be.  But this is trivial.  This is likely the best DVD edition this film will ever have.  I can't comment on any Blu-ray version.

4 stars for the film, 5 stars for the DVD edition.  I round it up to 5 stars, because for fantasy/adventure fans it is a must-have.",1396569600,,4047,4.656338028169014

696149,5,6303626467,"This 1935 RKO release is a fun watch. Lavish and elaborately filmed, the story of eternal youth and love top-stars Helen Gahagan, in her only film role. Some say her performance is less than stellar and that she lacks the beauty to pull off such a role, but I rather like her portrayal. In acting and looks, she hits the mark for me. Supposedly, her visual appearance was Disney's inspiration for the wicked queen in Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, which came out a few years later and this is apparant if you look at the two images. Ms. Gahagan, a former stage actress, had more fame years later as Nixon's adversary in the 1950s. It was she who supposedly coined the phrase: ""Tricky Dick"". As this DVD contains the colorized as well as the black-and-white versions, I will just say that the disc gives you the choice, so watch whatever version you like. This film was considered lost for many years before being found in Buster Keaton's garage! There are so many films from our film heritage which are lost today, but new finds happen all the time, and in some strange places. The Mysterious Island, a 1929 MGM part-talkie was recently found in an eastern European film archive in it's original two-color Technicolor. As I have only seen the black-and-white surviving print on TCM, it will be interesting to see this if and when a restored version makes it to TV. Back on topic, She is a fun film which plays a little like one of the more fantastic serials of that era. Flash Gordon or Undersea Kingdom come to mind. A disappointment at the time of it's release, She is pure escapist fantasy, and with the way the world is today, everybody needs a little escapism.",1393372800,,1667,4.56

NetFlix did not seem to have the colorized version so buying it was the only recourse.  I am not necessarily a big fan of colorization but personally I don't think that either Things to Come (1936), or She (1935,) would be very ""watchable"" in their original black and white (i.e., non-colorized) versions.

The 1935 She was so much more spectacular than the 1965 version that if you are a fan of the '65 version you MUST see the '35 version.  And if you are simply a fan of 30's movies both should be on your Must See list (colorization optional).",1350864000,2,744,4.401459854014599

It is a wonderful film that speaks of 1930s Hollywood, replete with elaborate sets, paintings, dance sequences and a good plot.  Randolph Scott and Helen Gahagam play the odd pairing of a modern man sought by an ancient and ageless evil queen.  Helen Makc (Son of Kong) is good as the modern woman who stands in the way.  Nigel Bruce is a decent sidekick.  I only have a few criticisms: I wish we could have seen an animated sabretoothed tiger; the stone sculpture of the queen has blonde hair while Gahagan is a beautiful brunette; and the movie could have had at least one fight scene.

696257,4,6303626467,"This original black and white movie is only for the diehard fans or people born before the 50s, I suspect. It's based on a novel of a similar title and considered a classic in some circles. The movie version is about a young man who is called home by his dying uncle who convinces him that their ancestor found the Fountain of Youth. The nephew agrees to follow the path up to the arctic circle to discover this wondrous place, using old maps given to him. What ensues is the meeting of She, a woman of great powers and beauty, who believes the main character is her former lover reincarnated some 500 years later. Personally I felt Ursula Andress in a remake from the 60s was a better looking She but I found that Helen Gahagan was a better actor (even though she got overly melodramatic in her acting which was  typical for female actresses in that time period). This would be Gahagan's only movie role as she went into politics, tangled with Nixon and she and her people are supposed to be the ones who dubbed him ""Tricky Dick."" The original film didn't do well at the Box Office but the rerelease did a lot better. The phrase ""She who must be obeyed comes"" comes from the novel, not this movie. They originally planned to shoot this film in color but ran out of money. The villainess was a Disney inspiration for Evil Queen in ""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs"". Themes of imperialism, female authority and sexuality, race and evolution are prevalent. The movie diverges from the novel in a few important instances.

696298,4,6303626467,"""This movie is strange!""  That's what my wife, unused to science fiction, said several times as we watched this movie.  Sort of a 'journey to the center of the earth' story, actually taking place somewhere in the polar ice north of Russia/Siberia.  You will recognize some sets, such as the giant gate, from the original ""King Kong"".  The pace never slackens once Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce set off to find the flame of eternal life, somewhere in the hidden land below the ice.  Randolph Scott does an acceptable job as the leading man, playing much the same character as in his earlier westerns.  Nigel Bruce must be playing himself as his character is so similar to his portrayal of Doctor Watson in the Sherlock Holmes flicks.  Helen Gahagan is good as the cold-hearted ruler of the hidden land, and guardian of the flame of eternal life.  Helen Mack is real eye candy once she dons the gowns she is given upon reaching the hidden land.  I watched the colorized version and must say it is a splendid job of colorizing.  Much better than some of the earlier colorized movies from the 1990s.  The thrilling climax is a real delight.  Bizarre and colorful.  I won't tell how it turns out.  Let that be something to look forward to.  I have not yet watched the black and white version, or the extras.  Definitely worth the sale price of this DVD.  Although, the disc was rattling around loose inside its case when it arrived.  The disc had many minor scratches that did not seem to affect the colorized version that I watched.

696299,5,6303626467,"Merian C. Cooper's SHE (1935), is a nearly forgotten template for adventure/fantasy filmmaking of the highest calibre.

 This film is a faithful adaptation of the novel by H. Rider Haggard about an expedition to the Antarctic (Africa in the book) in search of the legendary ""flame of life"", which brings immortality. The explorers are captured by She, a woman who has bathed in the flame and has remained young for nearly 2,000 years.

Cooper's film is an  entertaining feast all the way; from Ruth Rose's sensitive, intelligent screenplay and Van Nest Polglase's stylish art deco set design, to  Max Steiner's exotic and moving music score. Expertly directed by Irving Pichel and Lansing Holden, SHE is pure showmanship presented with the customary Cooperesque flair so evident in his 1933 masterpiece, KING KONG.

Kino's DVD offers a colorized and the original black and white version, both of which were fully restored from 35mm material and contain previously missing footage. Although I'm not an advocate of colorization, I'll make an exception here because Cooper had originally wanted to make SHE in color, but his budget was cut preventing him from doing so. The colorization job Legend Films did on this is exceptional and looks authentic.

The array of special features in this 2 disc set are outstanding: Commentary by Cooper biographer Mark Cotta Vaz and master animator Ray Harryhausen, interviews with Harryhausen, Curator James V. D'Arc, and composer John Morgan, clips from the 1911 and 1927 versions of SHE, a trailer, production stills and art, posters and other rare material.

This is a prime example of the kind of movie making that defined the classic era when quality standards were high and good storytelling was foremost. Surrender to ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" and experience real adventure.",1322524800,,1815,5.149659863945578
696300,4,6303626467,"For much of humanity's reign on Earth, civilization's boundaries lay on the mysterious border of what lay beyond: places not seen, not mapped, populated with strange natives, with bizarre customs, some friendly, some not, some fabulously wealthy, and some possessing something else, something that we short-lived creatures long for . . . .

Back in the 1400s, intrepid explorers John Vincey and his wife journeyed to parts unknown in the wintery climes.  Five years later, John's wife is found, injured.  Before dying, she dictated a fantastic tale of strange people in a land beyond a wall of cliffs, of a flame of eternal life, and of John's murder.  Her last wish: send this to my son . . . .

Of course, no one believed this wild tale, but it was passed along from generation to generation until 1935, when Leo Vincey was summoned to England by his dying uncle to receive the family legacy.  Leo's uncle was convinced that the tale was true and urged young Leo to go find this life-giving flame.

If you are Leo, you are game for adventure.  You set out on a dog sled, make a deal with a trader, find his daughter very attractive, find yourself dodging falling ice, and wondering if the natives are friendly, until the fight breaks out.  You are injured, you pass out, but when you come to, you see a beautiful woman lovingly looking down at you, who is she?

If you are She, you are terribly lonely.  There was only one love in your life: John Vincey.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  You have mourned his loss for centuries, until one day your slaves brought you a stretcher bearing a man, your heart flutters in recognition - John has come back!

The acting is what you would expect for the period, the movie drags and is corny, but there is structure in four parts. It is quite philosophical in places, with some dramatic speeches and nuances. The incredibly innocent beauty of Helen Mack, former child star, at times just stops the action, although her abilities are quite sporadic. Nigel Bruce is so damn blustery, English, and irritating you want to see him killed and eaten, but then that is his constant character. There is waaaayyy too much ""ritual"" dancing and choreography, which NEVER works in film. But, for the time, its kinda snappy, if verging on Buzby Berkley at one point. You expect them to break into a tap chorus line, but thankfully they don't. But I think they thought about it.  This movie deserves your attention. I recommend it.",1301875200,2,970,4.914634146341464
696302,3,6303626467,"While this film truly is fantastic, there are certain things bogging it down on this dvd release from Kino. The major problem is the colorization process, which, when the dvd is inserted into the dvd player, is the first option you are given. The color in this new color version looks better than the Ted Turner colorizations that bastardized so many films. The color process makes the film look chalky, and does not look like 'it was shot yesterday' as Ray Harryhausen says in his commentary (which is one of the highlights of the release).
The film itself, however, is fantastic. A great adventure story with a great pace, great characters, effects, and a wonderful score by Max Steiner. Merian C. Cooper was supposedly disappointed by this film, and I can't understand why.
At times, however, the film does seem a bit preachy, and there are moments that don't hold up well. But there are moments in this film to be cherished, such as the sacrifice scene towards the close of the film, where an exciting and eccentric dance routine (reminiscent of ancient Egyptian dance moves they broke out on the dance floor some 3,000 years ago) and an exciting climax. All in all a good film.

696306,3,6303626467,"A couple of years after his great success with King Kong, M.C. Cooper decided to take another shot with ""She"", an action adventure film that did not come close to his King Kong episode.

There were a lot of similarities to Kong, from the native dress, the mystery of an ancient place, the large doors, the lands fraught with danger, pretty girl, yadda yadda.

In glorious black & white, 1935.  A branch of an English family ""went American"".  Leo Vincey (Samuel Scott, who is known for his later Westerns) is the spitting image of his great great something father of the 14th century.  That man had traveled north (so says his dying uncle who ""doesn't have much time and can explain only once"") to the Arctic, to a strange land where burns the immortal Flame of Life (all caps).

So Leo goes on his adventure and brings Nigel Bruce (Dr. Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame) and on their way pick up a girl and her father and a few natives.

Natives, being what they are, refuse to go into the dreaded mountain.  Avalanche ensues, wipes out everybody except our trio.  The girl is not all that broken up about losing her abusive father.

They run into cave dwellers who want to put a white hot helmet on Nigel's character.  This is never fully explained.  After Leo puts a few bullets into them, a more advanced civilization of soldiers comes in and captures them.

It's kind of a Lost World story, a forgotten civilization living in the hot beds of a glacier valley.  And in that valley (Shangri La - ish) burns a Flame of Life but who runs the whole operation but She, an arrogant queen who thinks her lover of 500 years has come back to see her.  Leo and her former 500 year old lover are spitting images of each other, imagine that.

Cooper seems more interested in the flamboyance of his production rather than the thrilling action audiences enjoyed with Kong.  There are so many dance numbers and wild choreography among the natives that I got bored rather quick.

But when She (initial caps) comes seductively sliding out from a foggy entrance, you are immediately stricken with a Wow factor that unfortunately did not keep throughout the film.

Good special effects, elaborate sets and pretty good acting are hampered by a slow driven storyline.  Max Steiner's music is great, and evokes great mood, though!  He had also composed King Kong and over 300 other films in his career!

Disappointing after King Kong, but worth a watch for you classic film fans!

696433,4,6303626467,"Having reviewed the 1965 Hammer version with Ursula Andress, it's only fair to weigh in on the 1935 RKO version. Both films have their strengths and weaknesses but both are worthy in their own way (see my other review). There is much of KING KONG in this production from the use of redecorated sets (the giant doors that Kong breaks), a screenplay by Ruth Rose complete with choice dialogue, and a throbbing Max Steiner score (some of it recycled). This movie also marks the culmination of producer Merian C. Cooper's forays into the exotic that he began with his silent documentaries GRASS and CHANG (though without his creative partner director Ernest B. Schoedsack). It was also his most expensive production to date and was a box office failure which seems strange today. Though out of circulation for many years thanks to Raymond Rohauer (a film collector and preservationist), it can now be seen here restored (as much as possible) by Ray Harryhausen including a colorized version.

The title role was enacted by Helen Gahagen, a stage actress married to Melvyn Douglas, who brings a regal bearing to ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"". She has a marvelous voice and with her hair down, was quite lovely to see but the failure of the film ended her Hollywwood career. Years later she would oppose Richard Nixon in California but that's another story. Nigel Bruce is at his best as Holly, far removed from his later Doctor Watson. This was also RKO contract player Helen Mack's finest hour. Topping it off is legendary silent actor Gustav von Seyfertitz in a rare speaking role as the High Priest. Randolph Scott is Randolph Scott. Though slow in places, it has some extraordinary set pieces such as the avalanche and the temple ceremony which show 1930s special effects at their height. The story strays more from Haggard than the 1965 version but for fans of old Hollywood style exotic adventure, it's hard to beat. Also available in a less expensive version from Legend Films.",1271548800,5,1974,4.840236686390533
696434,4,6303626467,"She is a 1935 film produced by Merian C. Cooper (King Kong). The film is based on H. Rider Haggard's novel of the same name. It stars Helen Gahagan as She (in her only film, she was a theater actress), Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce, with music by Max Steiner (with music as equally great as ""Rise of Spring"") . The film is set in the Arctic rather than in Africa (the setting of the original novel), depicting its ancient civilization in an Art Deco style, and features convincing scenes of destruction.

While visiting his dying uncle, Leo Vincey learns of a family fortune lost in the tundra of Siberia 500 years ago by his ancestor, he heads out with family friend Horace Holly to try to discover the land and its secret of immortality, said to be contained within a mystic fire. Picking up Tanya, a guide's daughter, in the frozen Russian arctic, they stumble upon Kor, revealed to be a hidden civilization ruled over by an immortal queen, called She, who believes Vincey is her long-lost lover John Vincey, Leo's ancestor.

How cool is to find hidden gems like this. It might not be the greatest adventure movie ever done but it certainly has it charm. Gahagan's performance is mysterious and the whole movie has a haunting feel that stays with you long after is done.
For being a 1930s movie the sets are pretty amazing and you do get the feel you just entered a forbidden zone. Watch the new color version (done with state of the art technology), it truly brings out the beauty of the landscape and more than often you will forget you are watching a colorized version.",1269820800,,1576,4.545774647887324
696435,3,6303626467,"While this film is historically interesting, any fans of the original KING KONG looking to be wowed again by Merien C. Cooper will probably be disappointed.  While the film does have points to recommend, with its impressive set design and costuming, and a brilliant (as always) score by Max Steiner, it's unfortunate that the two actors cast in the leading roles fail to impress.  Randolph Scott (star of innumerable B-westerns) is positively wooden as the hero, Leo Vincey, and the stilted dialogue given to him doesn't help.  Helen Gahagan as ""She"" (I don't believe she's ever referred to by Rider Haggard's name ""Ayesha"" anywhere in the film) is less-than-impressive in a role that really requires a stunningly statuesque beauty the likes of a Sybil Danning or an Ursula Andress (who played She in the 1960s Warner Bros./Hammer Films adaptation of the book).  In fact, Gahagan is more reminiscent of the evil queen in Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE (it's even possible that the animators on that film were influenced by this one). Definitely NOT believable as someone whose overwhelming sexual attractiveness to men allows her to dominate them over the course of thousands of years. And again, the dialogue she is given to deliver is atrocious, the kind of highly stylized verbiage that might have been pulled off by an actress of superior talent, which Helen Gahagan clearly isn't.  A bright point in the film is the disarmingly charming Helen Mack (previously seen in SON OF KONG) as Tanya, who has a natural beauty and allure (despite her somewhat annoying tendency to constantly refer to the hero as ""Lay-o"") comparable to Fay Wray's.

Overall, the movie doesn't quite come off convincingly, though, and so it's easy to see why it did poor box office in its time and has faded into obscurity.  Regardless, this film will still be required viewing for fans of KING KONG, SON OF KONG, and THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, Merien C. Cooper's other classic films.  The colorization process (which I was initially abhorrent of back in the late 1980s when they colorized the original KING KONG) has come a long way since then, and actually adds value to this film (purists can still watch the black and white version, also included on this disc).",1266710400,4,2233,4.904509283819628

He charges Leo to start a new search, to be accompanied by John's colleague Horace Holly (Nigel Bruce) - and then dies.  Soon Leo and Horace are fighting their way through the far north, eventually hooking up with Dugmore (Lumsden Hare) and his daughter Tanya (Helen Mack) and, with the help of several native guides and two dog teams trying to penetrate an impassible Arctic wall.  An avalanche wipes out most of the party, but opens up a cave, through which the now small group emerges into the secret kingdom of Kor, ruled over by Queen Hash-A-Mo-Tep (Helen Gahagan), the ageless She, who has been waiting for centuries for the return of her beloved - Leo's ancestor, of course.  Will Leo stay with She?  Will he bathe in the eternal fire and stay young forever?  What will happen to Holly and Tanya, of no use to the imperious She?

Today this 1935 film, the second full-length feature adaptation (a very loose one, apparently) of H. Rider Haggard's 1886 novel, is best known for two elements: it's spectacular production, with some of the largest and best sets in any film of this type from the era and terrific special effects, and Helen Gahagan's mysterious and fascinating performance - her only film role.  The film was designed to captitalize on the success of KING KONG, but failed to do so though it is a thrilling spectacle, ably directed by Lansing C. Holden and Irving Pichel, with one of Max Steiner's best scores and wonderful Deco/expressionist art direction by Van Nest Polglase.  I kept thinking DR. CALIGARI meets FLASH GORDON during the scenes set in the palace in Kor, but there are echoes of KONG as well, and also hints of films to come - take a look at the sacrifice scene in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and compare it to the one here, for example.

As I said, Gahagan has a certain magnetic quality - which no doubt helped her win a few terms as a Democratic congresswoman in California right after World War II, though it was no match for Tricky Dick Nixon when she ran against him for the Senate in 1950; she lost but the nickname she coined for the future president stuck.  I'm not sure why she gave up acting so quickly; she had a commanding presence and voice and is as believable as can be expected as an ageless evil queen ruling a lost city; there's something almost Garboesque about her I think.  Alas the rest of the cast doesn't fare so well; Scott is terribly stiff and uneasy and seems at times to be trying to hide his Virginia accent, Mack is pretty terrible (except for one fairly crucial scene where she tries to convince Leo to leave with her in which she seems genuinely emotional), and Bruce doesn't have anything interesting to do after the first third of the film.  Also, there are some fairly noticeable continuity issues near the end of the film, perhaps due to the cutting of several minutes from the original release - the film only exists today courtesy of one surviving print saved by Buster Keaton!

All in all, despite some wooden acting and a few story issues, this is a terrific spectacle, exciting and generally well-paced but with Gahagan really giving the title role a melancholy power that lifts it a bit beyond it's pulp roots, and sets and FX that put it near the top of the heap of studio adventure films from this period.  I have the Kino VHS; I think the DVD is taken from the same source print and though I'm sure it looks a little better, the VHS is eminently watchable still.",1257984000,2,3812,4.577092511013216

Ms. Gahagan simply is not convincing in the role of the eternal queen. This version also changes the original story and moves it to the Arctic??.

The remake with Ursula Andress was much better in terms of casting and in staying faithful to the original story. The acting in this remake was also much better than the 1935 version in my humble opinion. Ursula Andress is perfect and stunning in the role of queen Ayesha, She-who-must-be-obeyed. Her performance is certainly more convincing than that of Ms. Gahagan.

Look for the actor that stops beating his drum even though the sound track says he continues; look for the actress who was supposed to get her torch lit during a choreographed dance sequence and doesn't manage it; and look for the drummer who is grinning so maniacally that you wonder if maybe he thought he was in a comedy piece, and not doing what was supposed to be a highly dramatic scene.

That said, there's entertainment to be had here, at least if you don't mind the bizarre and overly long dance number near the end, or She's occasionally over the top monologues. (I mentally renamed her as She Who Takes Herself Too Seriously, partway into the movie.) Melodramatic and meandering by turns, but still worth a rent.",1241913600,3,941,4.62874251497006

Cooper, music composer Max Steiner and script supervisor Ruth Rose) for another rollicking adventure yarn.  Based on the novel by H. Rider Haggard, SHE is the story of a group of explorers who travel deep into the artic in search of a mysterious life-force....the flame of life which bestows immortality on those who are brave enough to enter it.

Leo Vincey (Randolph Scott), Holly (Nigel Bruce), and Tanya (Helen Mack) join forces to track down the Flame of Life, and instead stumble across a forgotten world of primitive cave-dwellers hidden behind a giant door, and the beautiful yet fearsome Queen Hash-A-Mo-Tep of Kor (Helen Gahagan), otherwise known as She Who Must Be Obeyed!

Randolph Scott is wooden yet fun in the role of Vincey, but it's Helen Gahagan's show all the way.  This was remarkably her only full-length film credit.  Helen Mack is a lovely presence, and Nigel Bruce provides solid support.

Forget the two tepid remake/sequels with Ursula Andress.  SHE is a grand adventure, filled with the flourishes that only Merian C. Cooper could provide.  A fantastic movie to while away a dull Sunday afternoon.  The colourised version on the Legend DVD is quite good, with sharp contrast and shadow detail.  Thankfully the disc also includes the original B&W print too.

This digital version of She is one of the best quality copies of the film you'll find, which is particularly important when viewing on a high resolution computer monitor.

696520,5,6303626467,"""I am yesterday, today, and tomorrow. I am sorrow and longing and hope unfulfilled. I am She Who Must Be Obeyed!""

There's never been an entirely successful sound version of H. Rider Haggard's She, but on re-viewing, the 1935 version comes far closer than any of its rivals. After five silent versions of varying degrees of popularity, a lavish version reuniting many of the team behind King Kong must have seemed a box-office slamdunk (though not enough of one for RKO to approve the cost of filming in Three-Strip Technicolor), yet proved a flop on its original release. Subsequently cut for reissues, it was only because Buster Keaton had a print of the film in his own collection that it initially survived being lost altogether.

At first sight there are a lot of changes from Haggard's novel. Leo Vincey is no longer the reincarnation of She's lost love of centuries earlier Kalikrites but a descendent of a 15th century explorer She fell in love with. Thematically the novel's repressed homosexual undercurrent is (understandably for 1935) lost, as are its early reflections on people's assumptions that those blessed with beauty are also exceptionally gifted, intelligent and innately decent (in the novel Leo is distinctly dim and ultimately lacking in moral stature despite his looks, while the slightly deformed but good-hearted and extremely intelligent Holly is regularly taken for a sinister dullard). Even the nature of Leo's quest has been changed - no longer a search to find She and his own destiny but a search for the Flame of Life and the lost kingdom of Kor, now relocated from Africa to the mountain ranges of Muscovy. Yet even with the reinvention of much of the first third of the book (borrowing heavily from the Tibetan mountain setting of the first of Haggard's three follow-up novels, Ayesha: The Return of She), Ruth Rose's adaptation cuts to the heart of the book: this is about the desperate desire for what we cannot have and how that longing can erode what makes us human.

Just as Leo's uncle has destroyed himself with his experiments to artificially create the Flame of Life with radioactivity, She's all-consuming obsession with a love that never really was has burnt out her very heart and soul, her passion, like her empire, one of the imagination: it's the possibility of immortality that Leo's fascinated by, not her, and he'll play her toyboy and cut out his companions without a second thought to attain it. Gifted with one of the great screen entrances of all time, silhouetted behind a wall of smoke at the top of a flight of palatial steps, Helen Gahagan is a very different interpretation of the role from the usual babe you'd crawl over broken glass to get to, more a matron weighed down by time and loneliness and freed from the moral code of mere mortals. Her scream of pain on seeing Vincey for the first time in several lifetimes is a genuinely shocking moment.

Broadway star Gahagan would take the lion's share of the blame for the film's failure, never making another movie and going into politics where she later become smeared as `the Pink Lady' by Nixon during the McCarthy era, though not before popularising his nickname `Tricky Dicky.' In truth the film's failure might be more down to its lack of action (though it does throw in a terrific avalanche and a vivid escape sequence at the end) and its lack of obviously sympathetic characters. Randolph Scott is suitably bland as Leo while Nigel Bruce, still four years away from his bumbling Dr Watson, is a convincingly determined and grounded figure here to act as counterpoint to the hero's growing loss of self, but it's left to Helen Mack's romantic interest to carry the torch for basic human decency. The greatest impact is made by former silent film director Gustav Von Seyffertitz, a combination of the figure of Friederich Von Leidebur and the voice of Bela Lugosi, as a wonderfully imposing high priest Bilali: when he says ""There are marvels to be seen here today,"" you believe him. (The eagle-eyed may also spot Native American Olympic medal winning athlete Jim Thorpe, later played onscreen by Burt Lancaster, also in there as the captain of the palace guards.)

Although more than ably directed by Irving Pichel and Lansing C. Holden with some superb and ambitious camera work courtesy of J. Roy Hunt, it's clearly producer Merian C. Cooper who's the driving force here. The model for King Kong's showman Carl Denham, he goes all-out to best his previous pictures here and nearly manages it despite the odd bit of studio penny-pinching. He certainly got his money's worth from Van Nest Polglase's truly magnificent design which shows real vision in details great and small, from the massive ceremonial halls to the mausoleum steps worn away over the years by She, although criminally the film's sole Oscar nomination went instead to Benjamin Zemach in the ""They had an Oscar for THAT?"" category of Best Dance Direction for the film's most relentless sequence of prolonged camp prior to a human sacrifice.

For a long-forgotten flop, it certainly left its mark on many who saw it. Just as the novel was clearly an influence on James Hilton's later Lost Horizon, the film is very obviously a big influence on Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, with She Who Must Be Obeyed rendering judgment in a costume the wicked queen would borrow for her little chats with her mirror. Ray Harryhausen took much from the film for his last Sinbad adventure, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, as well, not least the frozen sabre-toothed tiger that comes memorably to life, a sequence that at one time been mooted for Cooper's film before budget cuts meant dropping Willis O. Brien's planned stop-motion animation setpiece and leaving the beast encased in ice.

Harryhausen, along with Cooper biographer Mark Cotta Caz, provides the audio commentary on Kino's new 2-disc Region 1 NTSC DVD, but sadly much of the commentary is about the colorization process (the film is included in both black and white and colorized versions), which is considerably less than state-of-the-art. While Cooper had intended the film to be shot in color, it's doubtful he'd be impressed with the results. The ice sequences and avalanche look impressive, but flesh tones are still unconvincing and much of the colorized version has the look of an old magic coloring book. On the plus side, for the first time the film has been fully restored with the deleted scenes sourced by James D'Arc at the Brigham Young University (where Cooper and composer Max Steiner's collections are held) put back into the original black and white version as well as the colorized one. There's also a good interview with composer John Morgan about Max Steiner's acclaimed score.",1197763200,7,6752,4.891703056768559
696521,5,6303626467,A truly remarkable film and an overlooked classic. Great Special Effects for the time period and a totally entertaining action/adventure film on par with King Kong. The colorization of this film under the supervision of Ray Harryhausen is awesome. This is a FUN film that should be seen....,1196553600,,290,5.0625
696522,4,6303626467,"This is in response to the viewer who wanted more details about the 2-disc special edition of SHE.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the story basically involves some brave adventurers who head off on an expedition to a faraway land with the hope of finding a lost civilization rumored to possess a mysterious power source that can give eternal youth.  After a perilous journey, the explorers eventually locate the ancient people but run into trouble when they meet the cold-blooded female leader of the kingdom.

This new edition of SHE includes both a colorized version of the film and a restored print of the original B&W feature, along with a second disc full of bonus material.  For me, however, the main reason for getting this newer release of the film is that it's an expanded version that runs about 8 minutes longer than the original.

As for the film itself, SHE is one of the all-time great adventure movies.  One might quibble that there could have been a little more action instead of some lengthy sequences dealing with the sacrificial ceremonies and such, but it still has a thought-provoking mix of mystery and excitement that truly holds your attention.  If you liked the original KING KONG or JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH with James Mason, you're bound to enjoy this movie and it's certainly worth adding to your collection.

If you already own the previous Kino edition of SHE, this new version does indeed offer some impressive enhancements, so if you really love the movie I'd say it's worth the price to replace your old copy.  If you're just a casual fan, though, the older DVD is perfectly acceptable.  Bottom line: SHE is always a winner.",1189641600,42,1679,4.738831615120275
696573,4,6303626467,"Ah, they don't make them like this any more. Still my favorite version of a truly classic love story - think of it as a distaff version of the 1933 ""The Mummy"".  H. Rider Haggard's ""She"" is one of those classics that has been filmed EIGHT times. This version, from 1935, is probably the most faithful to the spirit of Haggard's novel, despite some very, VERY odd changes to the plot.

Everyone will associate Nigel Bruce with his unforgiveably buffonish portrayal of Dr. Watson in the Basil Rathbone Holmes series. Here, four years before the first of those were filmed, he plays the part of Holly, a bit of miscasting if ever there was one. Fortunately, he quickly fades into the background once things get moving. Helen Gahagan, a well-known stage actress, plays the immortal Ayesha, ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"". The agonized, piercing shriek she makes when seeing her injured lost love for the first time in 500 years is worth the entire film - its horrifying notes of despair and loss raise my hair just remembering it. Randolph Scott and Helen Mack are more products of their time - a bit stiff and stolid, working their ways through the film rather than really grabbing you. Surprisingly good special effects and make-up, especially with the avalanche scene and the ""Flame of Life"" ending.

This release features both the original black-and-white version, and one that's been ""colorized"". Colorization technology has come a long way since it's introduction over 20 years ago, and those of you who remember those early efforts, where the monotone shades seemed to follow their subjects a few milliseconds behind the action, should at least audition this DVD to see how far things have progressed. MOST effective is the shading given to the extensive matte paintings (thank goodness!), in many scenes giving a terrific sense of scale and distance missing from the B&W version. The massive sets also come across very convincingly and to me are the closest to what I'd pictured in reading the novel. Anyone who considers themselves a ""purist"" really should consider that this isn't ""Citizen Kane"": Cooper is on record wishing he could have filmed it in color if he'd had the budget, and also that this is a far cry from the cheesy early technology.

The letdown: the human sacrifice scene. I haven't seen so much camp since ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"". Besides the dancing cavemen (what, do they rehearse, or do they do this so often that they're really good at synchronized syncopations?), we get a marching band! (Watch for the drummer in the middle with the psychotic grin on his face. Makes me wonder what the heck was going on in his head!)

It seems RKO was to go the fateful route that Carl Denham took into obscurity and financial ruin.  After SON OF KONG, RKO released SHE and without the financial support needed for the undertaking.  It was to be in color and to include scenes of wooly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers and such but all was not to be as the budget was drastically cut.  Back again was Helen Mack from SON OF KONG and also starred Randolph Scott, which who's part was supposed to be played by Joel McCrea who played aside Fay Wray in THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME which was filmed during the production of KING KONG.

This DVD release honors the desire of Merian C. Cooper to release this film in color as it never was but done so now under the cooperation and direction of our beloved Ray Harryhausen, I'm sure as a tribute to the desires of Cooper himself.

Do not be put off by the ""colorization"" of this film.  It was the desire of Merian to be seen this way-we've just increased the budget a bit so we can all see what he wanted us to see.

696577,4,6303626467,"She is a good example of what makes old adventure films good and bad. It alternates between wooden acting by Randolph Scott as the thick-jawed hero Leo Vincey and beautifully bombastic work by the ladies in Leo's life, She (Helen Gahagan) and merely mortal Tanya (Helen Mack). It features too much exposition in its first moments, but then kicks into high gear, flying the heroes from a tedious conversation in Vincey's uncle's house right to the Arctic. Despite my modern sophistication, the build-up to the climax was so strong I even found myself literally on the edge of my seat. There's romance, jealousy, religion, secret worlds, and mankind's fateful quest for immortality.

Classic film lovers and fans of serials, old adventure and sci-fi movies, and H. Rider Haggard's over-the-top John Carter of Mars adventures will lap up She. The new colorized version, overseen carefully by an aged but imaginative Harryhausen, is a sight to behold. As a purist, I stuck to the black-and-white, but Harryhausen says producer Merian C.

He is told of the legacy of their ancestor John Vinsey who 500 years ago discovered a mystical land called Kor in the frozen northern regions of the Arctic beyond the Russian tundra.  It had been reported that within Kor there is an eternal flame which is capable of bestowing immortality.

Scott who along with his uncle's sidekick Horace Holly played by a pre- Dr. Watson Nigel Bruce embark on a perilous journey to the land of Kor.

It's unfortunate that the folks at Legend Films, who are distributing this new version (as well as other titles that are magically in color) feel they need to use Ray Harryhausen's name as much as they can in order to promote their colorized version. Though the film was originally ""intended"" on being shot in color, the bottom line is that it was not. This is ridiculous then that in this day and age-- after the failure of Ted Turner to colorize classic black and white films-- there are still people out there trying to make a buck by tampering with classic films in order to open up a new market. As Ray Harryhausen points out in one of the bonus interviews, there are, admittedly, some kids today who wouldn't even look at a black and white film as though this is sufficient justification to alter them. Fine. Let those kids grow up with their video games then but leave the other young movie fans to appreciate these films as they were originally filmed. Fortunately, the producers at Legend Films were smart enough to include the black and white version, as well as several worthwhile bonus features, such as an audio commentary by the great Ray Harryhausen & Mark Cotta Vaz, the author of the recent Merian Cooper biography. My advice is to watch the film in black and white first if you've never seen it and then watch it in color with the commentary track. The colorization still does not look natural and this is all done by the whim of a computer crew-- not by anyone connected to the original film.

696638,4,6303626467,"""She"" is a remarkable artifact of the early twentieth century. It's a lot like ""Lost Horizon"" from the same era, only more so.

English explorers head off in search of the fabled fountain of youth. (Not really a fountain this time, but close enough.) They pick up native guides along the way, and find their way into the secret caverns near the North Pole. There, they find the lost tribes of savages rules by She: She Who Must Be Obeyed (long before Rumpole made the phrase his own). Somehow, this turns into a catfight between the immortal She and the humble but plucky daughter of the northern guides, and I'll leave the ending for you to see for yourself.

""She"" wasn't made so long after the late 19th century, when the White Man's Burden may have been set down, but was still fresh in the cultural memory. As a result, it's no surprise that the native guides have to be led by the European who had lived among them for years. It's also no surprise that, the natives of that secret cavern are hunched, primitive cut-throats. She, with Her anglo features, is the civilizing influence in their world and their natural leader. If you're easily offended by the racial stereotypes of 70 years back, just give this one a miss.

It's also small surprise that the hero's lady is a petulant, ineffectual, and physically small woman, easily carried when she needs to be saved. Which, of course, is what she's there for. He sweeps her away from her guest-of-honor role at a human sacrifice, just before the knife plunges into her back. The sacrifice, by the way, turns into a mass choreography scene worthy of Busby Berkeley. Well, how were people supposed to know the movie was any good if it didn't have a big dance number?

Although it may have been a dramatic hit back then, it's a nice, safe popcorn movie for today's audiences. Well, fine. Wait for a rainy Saturday, pop the popcorn, and enjoy it. And, if you have kids, you'll appreciate the fact that 1930s movies didn't have to put people in bed with each other to show a romantic interest.

696639,3,6303626467,"Others can give readers the story line. Let me try to give you feel for the the film. It plays out more like a 1930's German Alpine Film than most RKO Studio films of the time. The story has some interesting twists that will remind the viewer Fritz Lang's The Spiders! In some ways it resembles Werewolf of London (1935)or the much better ""Lost Horizon"" (1937).
I can not agree with the comparisions (or hype) to King Kong! (There is ""no"" simularity other than in a broad sense of adventure.) True most of the cast and crew also worked on other RKO Merian C. Cooper films.
I would recommend this film as a second title of Rainy Saturday matinee .",1131580800,6,646,4.391666666666667
696640,4,6303626467,"A cursory glance at this film will yield a view of a rather creaky relic of early Hollywood mumbo jumbo. It is easy to dismiss this production as such until some very important aspects of the nature of this property are set forth.

First off, the story is taken from a turn of the century book written by H. Rider Haggard, a popular novelist whose works include a series of books that were enormously popular in their day and featured a hero named Alan Quartermaine, the character upon whom Indiana Jones was based in contemporary film works.

Haggard's works appealed mostly to boys, and ""She"" was unusual in that it's central character was a woman. Bringing this particular story to the screen insinuated a certain high brow panache, because of Haggard's established reputation as a ""serious"" writer/novelist.

Secondly, the woman selected to play the infamous She, Helen Gahagan (Douglas) was a serious actress and activist who soon after this movie, deserted Hollywood and it's gaudy trappings to pursue a successful career in politics on the West Coast throughout the 40's and 50's. In that respect, She herself was a precursor to the many celebrities that have gone on to similar pursuits in our day and age.

Lastly, because the kingdom over which She rules is mythical, the creative license the filmakers enjoyed in creating her realm of Kor, resulted in fabulous Art Deco fantasies of design, and believe you me, this movie is ""designed"" to the max.

Randolph Scott plays his part with the gee gosh gusto that would make him a cowboy star later in his career, but at this time, his physical beauty is striking, even if his acting isn't. (He WAS the model for the original Arrow Shirt man in the early 30's.)

There are really nifty special effects such as a giant avalanche and of course the morphing effects She experiences in the film's climax. The biggest scene is the strange rites conducted in the main Hall of Kor that HAS to rival anything ever thought up by Busby Berkeley with it's bizarre combination of Egyptian, Mayan and Copacabana nightclub sensibilities, choreography and all!

Add a dash of ""The Mummy"" and the always successful Boy meets Girl formula, and She emerges as a real icon of it's day and one that any spectacle lover will keep close to their heart. Pop the corn, turn off the lights and sit back and enjoy the movie.",1126224000,7,2353,4.752450980392157
696641,2,6303626467,"Theres nothing wrong with this movie. Its typical 1930s escapist fun. The problem here is the transfer of the film itself. I've ordered the DVD twice, through two different vendors and both had the same problem.  The bottom half of the picture flutters. This goes through about the first 10 minutes or so of the film and is extremely distracting. I can't say whether thats just how the copy of the print they used was (KINO is usually better than that) or if its just a batch of badly pressed DVDs.  I guess I'll wait awhile and try ordering it again in a year or so.  Too bad, as its really is a fun film.",1123113600,9,606,4.252173913043478
696642,4,6303626467,"If the 1935 SHE reminds you vaguely of the 1933 KING KONG do not be too surprised: both films were produced by Meriam C. Cooper, who endowed them with similar visual styles--and who tweaked the 1887 novel by H. Rider Haggard to create a similar story line as well.  Starring Broadway actress (and later two term Democratic congresswoman from California) Helen Gahagan in her only film role as The Eternal One, SHE did not, however, meet with the same financial success.  It lost a tremendous amount of money for RKO, was withdrawn, and for many years was thought to be completely lost.

Although the film alters the Haggard novel in a great many ways, it retains the basic elements.  Lured by a family legend, Leo Vincey (Randolph Scott) braves the frozen European north with family friend Horace Holly (Nigel Bruce, best known for his appearances in the Sherlock Holmes series) and innocent Tanya Dugmore (Helen Mack, popular 1930s ingenue.)  When an avalanche exposes a cavern, the three find that the Vincey family legend is not quite so fanciful after all.

Most particularly, they find themselves at the mercy of She Who Must Be Obeyed, a woman who recalls talk of Jesus Christ in the Jerusalem market place, a woman two thousand years old who preserves her life by bathing in a radioactive flame that vents from the volcanic floor of her hidden kingdom.  She (known here as Queen Hash-A-Mo-Tep) has been waiting for the reincarnation of her long-dead love, and Leo is his spitting image.

The acting styles are stiff even by 1935 standards and although Miss Gahagan is attractive in a 1930s way she lacks the stunning beauty attributed to She by the Haggard novel--but the great draw of the film was never intended to be great acting: like KING KONG, it is an action-adventure film with knockout sets (a few of them actually lifted from KING KONG), memorable special effects, and remarkable cinematographic set pieces.  Even as it borrowed from earlier films such as the 1932 Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, it would also influence later films in turn; it is hard, for example, to imagine the 1937 Ronald Coleman LOST HORIZON without it, and even the look of the evil queen in Disney's 1938 SNOW WHITE is said to have been inspired by Gahagan's look and performance.

The film has been released in several editions to the home market, and fans may be tempted by less expensive editions.  A word to the wise: Don't.  The film shows its age and there is no significant bonus material, but the Kino Video release (be it on VHS or DVD) offers what is probably the best print short of a digital restoration.  Recommended for fans of 1930s fantasy cinema.

7852079,5,6303626467,"Great! I was surprised. So many of the ""Included With Prime Movies"" are total crap. Not this one.

This movie was listed in the Trivia as a Raspberry Chronicles top 100 of bad movies. By what standard? Oldies? Well that was a much higher standard than now. This movie beats most modern films. The sets and choreography alone are very advanced for 1935, or any time. The cast is first rate. The dialogue is good. Poetic even. Giant gates from the King Kong set are reused. That's not all. Many great uses of relative size special effects (giant objects versus puny humans). Visually convincing.

So how come nobody knows about this movie? The only reason this movie was hiding in the shadows it turns out from the Trivia was because it was intended for color, but shot in black and white to save money; and it lost $180,000 at the box office its first year, which was movie and career death in those days (but nonetheless made it up with later releases, too late for leading lady's career). No wonder it lost money. Built for color, but released in black and white. Another studio management stupidity? On top of all that, all prints were lost early on. The only reason it survived was that Buster Keaton had a copy in his basement, which he later donated, and then was eventually colorized.

So, thank God for the modern colorization process. It makes the movie look like it was intended to look. This movie proves that not all colorization is an abomination of original creative purpose.",1525564800,,1488,4.628787878787879

The natives dancing made me chuckle--hilarious and the bogawogawoo gibberish spoken by the natives cracked me up.  Very little character development.  Subservient woman.

And the weak girl sits nearly at the feet of the Hero adoring him. The way women are depicted in this old movies is a contrast to today's modern women.

7852087,5,6303626467,"O.K. it was adjusted a lot.
Leo Vincey (Randolph Scott) all grown up is fresh back from the U.S. So he does not have to have an English accent. His dying uncle points to a portrait of a 500 year old Vincey in a Prince Valiant haircut that is the spitting image of Leo. Then with old sci-fi equipment in the background he is told a tail of radiation and a woman that will live for ever; Doctor Watson (oops) Horace Holly is standing by.
For readers that are familiar with the book, you are in for some laughs. Because the Vincey explorer was only five hundred years ago all the majors can speak English (or pigeon English). There is a native scene right out of Kong and a second with a sacrifice and a ritual dance. Can it be that this is the same director, Producer Merian C. Cooper, known for King Kong?
On a more serious side the eternal questions posed in the book were replaces with a love story made for two.
Helen Gahagan is a rather unique name so I looked it up in Ephraim Kats ""The Film Encyclopedia""; turns out among other things she was married to Melvyn Douglas, was the author of ""The Eleanor Roosevelt we Remember"" (1963). A Democratic congress woman. And was defeated by Richard Nixon in her bid or a Senate seat.",1503792000,,1228,4.32034632034632
7852088,4,6303626467,"Released in 1935 and loosely based on H. Rider Haggards novel, She stars Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce as explorers leading an expedition to the Arctic to find a lost civilization. Helen Mack hooks up with them at some point.  The journey leads to a quasi-immortal queen of some sort with Julius Adler playing her high priest. The hulking Noble Johnson is on hand as the Amahaggar chief.

This DVD includes the original B&W version and also a colorized version. I prefer the latter since I find B&W to be a flat presentation for cinema and a lavish adventure pic like this deserves color. With the exception of the directors, the production team is the same as 1933s King Kong with Merian C. Cooper producing, Ruth Rose scripting (along with Dudley Nichols added dialogue) and scored by Max Steiner. Speaking of the latter, the music is outstanding, particularly for such an old flick. You can tell that the adventurous adult tone, the sets and the music were a big influence on Gene Roddenberrys original Star Trek.

In regards to King Kong, this is sort of the feminine flip side to that hallmark adventure fantasy. The architectural sets were influenced by cubism, expressionism, and art deco. The tribal dance sequence in the third act is a highlight, combined with the excellent score for an entrancing experience, as potent as anything by Igor Stravinsky.

An aged yet youthful-appearing queen thinks that she has found her Shangri La, but something unexpected is in store. The flame of life can only last so long before it dies out due to ill-character of the power mad, vain, jealous and possessive queen. Shes living in a fool's paradise and is as tragic as she is blessed. Her arrogance, acquired over hundreds of years of unchallenged rule, makes her view others lives as paltry and transient. Vanity gets a real spanking with some remarkable F/X for the era. In the book, Ayesha was more stunningly imperious and not just a pasty control freak.

She, by the way, is played by Helen Gahagan, a stage actress and opera singer who only made this single film before going into politics and championing migrant workers in California as a Democrat before the party became the Demoncraps. She had a not-so-secret affair with Lyndon B. Johnson on Capitol Hill and coined Nixon's nickname ""Tricky Dick."" While shes actually rather plain-looking, she has an impressive mane and a powerful presence; She could be the prototype for the wicked queen in ""Snow White"" or the evil Maleficent.

The African setting of the book was obviously changed to the arctic so as not to compete with the popular Weissmuller Tarzan series that just released the hit Tarzan and His Mate the year before. There was also a great fascination with the arctic at the time dating back to the early 19th Century. They certainly did a good job with the studio-bound sets, giving the illusion of the arctic, except that you cant see the characters breath.

If you have a taste for 1930s adventure epics like King Kong, Gunga Din (1939), and King Solomon's Mines (1937), you will probably appreciate She. The Hammer version from 1965 isn't as lavish or compelling, despite the quality cast with Ursula Andress in the titular role; its also straddled with a lousy score.

The film runs 101 minutes (original) and 95 minutes (reissue) and was shot entirely at Prudential Studios, Los Angeles, California. DIRECTORS: Lansing C. Holden & Irving Pichel.
