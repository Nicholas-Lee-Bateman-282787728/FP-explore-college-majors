8374603,3,B002N5KDXE,"Arthaus Musik must think a large audience wants a PG-13 version of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, issuing this Blu-ray from the Teatro del Maggio Musical Fiorentino only a couple of years after the blistering 2006 Amsterdam production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-MacBeth-of-Mtsensk-Blu-ray/dp/B0025XW96I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady MacBeth of Mtsensk [Blu-ray</a>]. To judge by a few reviews, some opera lovers are in fact glad to have a Lady Macbeth whose thermostat is turned down a few degrees.

But if the sex and violence are taken out, what's left? Satire -- a trait whose presence in Lady Macbeth this Italian show seems blissfully unaware of.

When the 29-year-old composer's second opera premiered in 1934, Shostakovich was already recognized as a master satirist. His first opera, The Nose (1928), was taken from the satirical story by Gogol (whose name is dropped in Lady Macbeth). Shostakovich's 1930 ballet The Golden Age centers on a Soviet soccer team that travels to a Western city to encounter characters and situations outlawed back in the USSR. His second ballet, The Bolt, revolves around shoddy, subversive work in a Soviet factory.

Lady Macbeth's satire, though, was just a secondary reason the opera brought the fear of death down on Shostakovich's head.

In two years, Lady Macbeth ran up a remarkable box office record. It received 83 sold-out performances in Moscow, nearly 100 in Leningrad. It was staged in New York, Cleveland, London, Stockholm, Zrich, Copenhagen, Argentina, Czechoslovakia. Tickets were in such demand that when Stalin went to the Bolshoi on Jan. 26, 1936, three Moscow productions were running simultaneously.

Stalin didn't stay around to see the end, however. Furious, the butcher of millions who was a prude about sex stormed out, and two days later, an editorial appeared on Pravda's front page denouncing the opera and stigmatizing its composer as an Enemy of the People. For Shostakovich, the fun times were over. And Lady Macbeth was sent to Siberia.

Watching Fiorentino's Lady Macbeth, you could fail to realize any satirical intentions are in play. One opportunity after another is missed, and the lack of bite in the too-polished orchestra doesn't help. Instead, the scenes meant to be satirical must be head-scratchers for an audience not familiar with the opera.

For example, Shostakovich's version of the drunken porter in Shakespeare's Macbeth doesn't stagger in alone to relieve himself in the middle of the night. Instead, he is joined by a chorus line of peasants, who aren't drinking but are still having a gay old time. In this presentation, you'd have to know the joke beforehand to get it. Even if you do, it's a stretch here.

Further, the chief of police is a (literally) moustache-twirling Keystone Cop cartoon who belongs in a farce, not a satire. Plus, the humor of the police apprehending a socialist who insists he does believe in God sails right past.

As for the sex and violence hardwired into the score, the scene of Katerina's adultery with Sergei is demurely hidden behind a wall, and their murder of her husband when he returns from a business trip takes place out of the audience's line of sight. Wearing a white shirt, Sergei emerges from a lengthy whipping by Katerina's father-in-law without a spot of blood showing. Portraying the two lovers, Jeanne-Michle Charbonnet and Sergej Kunaev lack the stage presence and vocal prowess of Eva-Maria Westbroek and Christopher Ventris in Amsterdam. Katerina's falling-off-the-boat suicide is so anticlimactic we hardly notice.

The Italian production has its merits. Vladimir Vaneev reprises his dual role from Amsterdam as Boris the abusive but lecherous father-in-law and as the old convict whose monologue opens Act IV. As Boris, Vaneev makes a good villain and chews up the scenery as he's dying from Katerina's poisoned mushrooms.

One noteworthy feature of the performance is that during some of the orchestral interludes, the floor of the pit rises to stage level, enabling the orchestra to assume its proper role as a character in the action. A nice touch, that.

Because the opera is presented complete on one Blu-ray, there's no room for extras. But it is complete and in much better video and sound than the 2002 Barcelona DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shostakovich-Lady-Macbeth-of-Mtsensk-Secunde-Ventris-Kotcherga-Vas-Clark-Nesterenko-Capelle-Anissimov-Barcelona-Opera/dp/B0002TTTJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shostakovich - Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk / Secunde, Ventris, Kotcherga, Vas, Clark, Nesterenko, Capelle, Anissimov, Barcelona Opera</a>. So for those who prefer not to see and hear raw humanity in all its ugliness and aspirations, this Fiorentino Lady Macbeth might serve its purpose. If you want the full monty, you'll have to go to Amsterdam.",1409529600,2,4914,5.563587684069612
8374604,5,B002N5KDXE,"The first performance of this opera took place in 1934, Leningrad(St Petersburg). It was considered a work of genius in the Soviet Union. The work was also played overseas. Early in 1936 Stalin saw a performance and considered it perverse sexually. Then an editoral in Pravda,the Soviet paper, condemned the opera as ""Muddle instead of music"". It is believed that the editorial was written by Stalin, or he was behind the attack.  Shostakovich was now in fear of his life. At the time, thousands of people including his relatives were disappearing, killed by Stalins minions. The composer withdrew the opera  and his forth symphony, which was not seen again in the Soviet union for another thirty years. His 4th to 9th Symphonies the composer considered his tombstones. How he survived Stalin, I suggest you get hold of the DVD, a documentary called Shostakovich against Stalin, the war symphonies. Music conducted by Valery Gergiev.

The staging and dress is traditional . Set in a barn like structure, which eventually becomes a bridge and camping area. Set in late 19th century Czarist Russia, about a rich Merchant who often leaves his wife,who finds a lover because of being bored. She kills the father in law, and both the lover and she murder the husband. His body is found and they are caught. On the way to Siberia,the lover falls for another woman. Katerina the wife, pushes the other women into the water and she jumps in, and they both drown. Rather depressing you might think. The opera has sardonic humour. The conductor James Conlon, an American,brings out the tensions,the raw sexual under currents, emotion and lyrical side of the score. His tempo are brisk and with his Italian Orchestra,bring out the true Russian flavour. Katerina, the merchants wife, Jeanne-Michele Chabonnet, is a dramatic soprano. She could be considered a near mezzo, because of her low notes. She makes you feel sorry for her plight. I wonder why I have never heard of her. She is brilliant in this part. All the singers are good, including Vladimir Vaneev as Boris, the father in law, Vsevolod Grivnov as the husband and Sergej Kunaev as Sergei,the lover. There are no weaknesses in this performance. Also, traditionalists should  have no fears about the performance. The sexuality is there, but the director Lev Dodin takes the view that less is more. He does not take any liberties with the stage directions. The reviewer who criticized this performance obviously was watching another opera.

I was simply overwhelmed by this performance. Blown away. Emotionally drained. Wow!

I used a Denon DX1000DB Bluray mini system, which had two speakers,but because of a new invention gives you surround sound. You can use earphones.  New to Australia, cost here 1,500 Aus dollars. Region Worldwide. PCM stereo. DTS-HD Master Audio 7. I. 1O80 full HD. Format 16.9.",1292544000,3,2850,5.0
8374605,4,B002N5KDXE,"I have purchased every generally available CD, DVD and Blu ray release of this opera and have seen it on TV and in the opera house many times. The combination of violence, sex and tough drama even out on the banks of the Volga are not easy to pack into a commercial production in the theatre and it is not easy to cast. On balance I feel this is the best of modern productions despite some reservations here and there. The Rostropovich version on DVD, dubbed with Czech actors, is wonderfully sung but is heavily cut and today it looks its age. The old Soviet film released a few years ago by Decca is also special but again looks old. I have always had a soft spot for the ENO production with Willard White and Josephine Barstow which was of the original version but this is not officially available. I prefer this new Blu ray to the other Blu ray release from Holland. It is better staged, mostly better cast and with more suitable costumes and sets. The explicit violence and sex is implied rather than spread out all over the stage and I think it is the better for it. There is still room for the ultimate version and perhaps Gergiev will do this in Russia with a full Russian cast, but until then this is the one to go for. Frankly I did not expect it coming from romantic Italy with an American conductor but there you go! Recommended.",1266278400,9,1341,4.346613545816733
