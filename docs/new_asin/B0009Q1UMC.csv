She moves through the 50's, 60's, 70's & 80's teaching you all the dances you've always wanted to learn..or miss from your youth.  I personally LOVE the dances from the 50's! This video is great for any age and any skill level. LOVE IT!!!",1243036800,3,335,4.317460317460317
8065293,5,B0009Q1UMC,"I don't know what that other person was talking about - this DVD is fantastic!!!  I have used it for so many parties, I've given it as gifts and I absolutely love this!  I can ROCK the dance floor now - and, boy, is my wife happy that I now dance with her!!  I'm serious - this is terrific!",1480982400,,290,3.8813559322033897
8065294,5,B0009Q1UMC,"This is a GREAT instructional video to use as a refresher or for some first time steps.  Christy is full of energy and breaks down steps making it easy to follow.  The music used for all the decades is a lot of fun!  Yes, I recommend this DVD!",1470614400,,243,4.020833333333333
8065295,1,B0009Q1UMC,"I studied Christy Lane's 80's dance movies with ardent zeal -- I attended a retro party last night and had been preparing for it for two weeks with this DVD instructional.

Christy Lane, you are unforgivably clueless.

There I was, lockin', tickin', and poppin', just as Miz Christy showed.

WHAT A DISASTER.

I was *booed*.  And I had bits of food hurled in my general direction, accompanied by the nastiest verbal comments!  And I imitated Miss Lane's moves PRECISELY!

I blame my traumatizing experience on the exceedingly poor dance stylings of Christy Lane and nothing else!!!!",1464220800,,582,5.0
8065296,5,B0009Q1UMC,"I was VERY happy with the level of expertise in instruction from Christy Lane.  I have seen her live and have used her DVD's many times and have always been pleased with the results. I've used them for parties - and had a blast.  I found the instruction easy to follow and learn.  Christy has a very charismatic way of teaching, making her DVD's an exceptional value in my opinion.  If I ever want to learn any dance - I will look to Christy Lane's DVD's first, as I sincerely appreciate her teaching method.",1456531200,,508,4.372340425531915
8065297,1,B0009Q1UMC,Unfortunately the most boring dance DVD I've ever purchased... Every era had dance moves and diff dance moves according to the dance and song.. This immed dived in to one dance being the 50's... Became so bored I haven't made it to the one dance of the 60's...Another wasted 30$ just hope the line dance video I spent 55 on is way better!!! I've been to scared to even watch it!!!,1432252800,,380,4.366197183098592
8065298,1,B0009Q1UMC,"There are way better videos for this decade, don't even bother.",1417996800,,63,4.818181818181818
8065299,5,B0009Q1UMC,Easy to learn and great instruction.  Little cheesy but great material and great for all ages.  I would recommend this dvd.,1372377600,,123,4.809523809523809
8065300,5,B0009Q1UMC,My friend's wedding was all 60s and I really needed to get some steps down fast and was lucky enough to find this DVD in stock.  Very easy to understand and got me going quickly.  I looked like I knew what I was doing at the wedding and this was well worth the money in my opinion.,1323043200,,281,3.912280701754386
8065301,4,B0009Q1UMC,"I really enjoy this DVD.  I wanted to learn the swing from the 50's and refresh my memory on the dances of the 60's.  Christy does a quick review of the 60's dances but spends time on the swing.  Now, if my husband would just learn to be a good lead. LOL  The only negative thing that I can say is about the price.  Too expensive but I ordered it because it was just what I wanted.",1281484800,,381,3.896103896103896
8065302,1,B0009Q1UMC,"I ordered this in the hopes that it would help me learn a bunch of the steps from the sixties that I needed to incorporate into a 60's themed theatrical production.  Ms. Lane spends practically less than a minute on each step and it's variations...and the entire sixties section barely lasts eight minutes.  For twenty dollars this dvd might be worth it - but for the price, the silly production values, and the fact there is so little actual material here... it's insanely overpriced.",1248220800,7,485,4.761904761904762
