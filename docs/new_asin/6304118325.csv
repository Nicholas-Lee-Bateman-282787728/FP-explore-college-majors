7861798,3,6304118325,"This cheap-looking, shot-on-video (SOV) 1987 drug smuggling drama starring Sergio Goyri (sans his signature macho 'stache), Silvia Manriquez and perennial old dude/bad guy Victor Junco, while not a ""good"" film by and objective standards, does have certain perverse charms for those inclined toward the 'so-bad-it's-good' school of cinematic entertainment.

For one thing, despite being a mere 85 minutes long, it is liberally larded with long, LONG takes that, in a normal film, would be done by the second unit and last mere seconds (e.g. airplanes landing, taxi cabs advancing in a line at the airport, feet walking, hands passing telegrams, etc.). There's further padding in the form of nightclub acts in which we get to see what feels like the ENTIRE act, instead of just glimpsed highlights. I kept waiting for Doris Wishman-like sequences of inanimate objects with accompanying voiceover.

Even 'dramatic' scenes, like the climax in which two bad guys are fed poisoned dope and begin convulsing violently, spitting up blood, etc. while Silvia Manriquez looks on, chortling with her sidekick in a thoroughly evil fashion - this goes on and on and ON, to the point that it becomes bizarrely funny, which I hardly think was the intent. And, of course, that's why it's funny.",1348531200,,1277,5.164251207729468
