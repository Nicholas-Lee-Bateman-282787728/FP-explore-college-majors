5674439,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Finally, fans get exactly what they've been asking for. Two seasons, Blu-ray, cheap price, lots of bonus features. Bring it on!
I'm so glad CN finally got to their senses and are putting out a sensible release. Apparently Adventure Time's season one set did well enough to justify more season releases. Between this and Animaniacs Vol. 4 getting released, I'm nearly on good terms with Warner Home Video again. Let's just hope enough people buy this (and Adventure Time's Blu-ray sets) to keep the good stuff flowing.",1363564800,10,517,4.954022988505747
5674440,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Previous DVDs of this show would be presented in a form of single discs with random episodes from various seasons. (a partial norm of CN's distributions) Good things come to those who wait, and it now shows.

The show itself is, thankfully, one of the best CN shows out there. The title may sound like just a regular show... but that's what you would least expect.  The humor and characters (along with very solid casting) are the aspects that make this show what it is.  While it shouldn't be shown to very young kids (hence the TV-PG rating), the humor is spot-on to older kids and adults.  Along with Adventure Time, this show is definitely worth seeing.  Buying the show in season form is definitely a highest recommendation.",1363478400,31,729,4.6640625
5674441,5,B00BUAJZGY,The Regular Show is such a great cartoon which can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. It's insanely creative and all out funny. I highly recommend it.,1495756800,,151,4.428571428571429

5674453,4,B00BUAJZGY,"J.G. Quintel's Regular show is a very important show as it along with Adventure Time helped launch the current mini-rennisance that Cartoon Network has had during the 2010's.  Mixing 80's & 90's nostalgia with more modern storytelling,  Regular Show makes for a genuinly enjoyable viewing experience.",1474934400,,300,5.5

5674455,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Regular Show is a show about an anthropomorphic Blue Jay and Racoon going about their not-so-normal lives as Park Custodians. Pretty much something goes wrong every day at this park of theirs with varying degrees of weirdness.

Within this collection are the first two seasons, which combined are about the size of every following season to the show. In any case, there are some real gems of episodes for those in the need of a good laugh. If you're a fan of 80s/90s pop culture, you'll dig this DVD set.",1469923200,,504,4.6

5674494,5,B00BUAJZGY,"I stumbled across this show one day and could not believe how much I enjoyed it. It's not the raunchy, over the top humor of Family Guy, South Park or even the Simpsons but its not totally childish or kid based. All of the characters are great and the episodes are short and sweet. The episodes almost always have some supernatural/over the top insanity and the humor ranges from things like masculine workouts, video games, binge eating, and bosses with anger issues. Its also great to have on if you just want something on in the background while you're hanging out with friends and want to occasionally pay attention to it and get a few laughs. If you're into animation or comedy at all then this is definitely worth a buy. For some reason Season 3 is not available on Blu Ray yet but this set is.",1403827200,,800,4.448979591836735

5674499,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Cartoon Network has been extremely notorious of late for selling ""packs"" DVD's of Regular Show, Adventure Time and many others. These packs were completely unsatisfactory as they only had a handful of randomely selected episodes that were completely out of order. While the episodes are still great by themselves, you completely miss the whole experience from the character/story development that you get when you watch them all in order.

FINALLY they put them all in order in a DVD with the first two COMPLETE SEASONS! I cannot even say how happy I was to see this DVD coming out. I won't go into detail about the show itself (you can find that plenty of other places) but I will just say that as an avid fan of both Regular Show, Adventure Time, and shows past, immensely enjoyed/am enjoying this DVD!",1398729600,6,804,4.742857142857143
5674500,3,B00BUAJZGY,"Regular Show the show gets 5 stars. Regular Show the bluray release gets 3. While I like that all the episodes fit on a single disc - perfect for marathoning it - I wish that there were more special features put into the disc. I also wish that when the play all feature is selected that every episode didn't play the opening theme. Finally, the Ultraviolet copy can only be redeemed on Flixster, not Vudu. That may not be a big deal to most people, but as someone whose entire UV collection is on Vudu that is something I wish were different.",1398211200,,542,4.323529411764706

5674502,5,B00BUAJZGY,i love this show its a amazing deal you get so many ep's that i can leave this thing on for hours and come back home and its still playing  great buy can wait till the next season pack. This show is so epic no matter how many times i see this.,1395273600,,243,3.673076923076923

5674511,5,B00BUAJZGY,"At first, I didn't like this show, but later in late 2011 or early 2012, I've totally got attached to this animated satire. It's funny and hilarious and teen friendly. This show actually made me feel good about myself, especially that ""This is my Jam"" episode, which is really wild. Let's not forget that ""Brain Eraser"" episode where it showed Mordecai accidentally saw Pops nude, which is based on myself because whenever I saw inappropriate stuff on TV or books, I see things in my imagination and can't look away. This is like the best thing that ever hits CN, along with Adventure Time. At first, I didn't like AT, but later in 2014, I now realized it's not so bad, but better than Problem Solverz, which is my worst nightmare from CN.",1391731200,,739,4.56390977443609

5674521,5,B00BUAJZGY,I bought this because I hardly get a chance to see any episodes.  It has it adult humor while keeping its child like charm.  I think would think that most adults who like animated series might enjoy it 80's reference and work humor.,1388880000,,232,4.372093023255814

Pops is way old school, high five ghost doesnt say much but hes always good for a five, skips the nipply know it all, and Muscle man rocks too, just don't make fun of his mom, thats his job.

Creator J.G.Quintel voices the semi-autobiographic Mordecai a 6 ft talking bluejay who can't fly or play the guitar, along side his friends: Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, High-Five Ghost, their Gumball machine boss Benson, Mordo's would-be-girlfriend Margret, Rigby's would-be-girlfriend Ellieen.  Occasionally they learn a life lesson or two like: Snails are BAD.  5 seasons since it's start in 2010, with over a hundred 11 minute episodes in the can already. Beginning with 'THE POWER' (although season 2's First Day reveals the Boys hiring & consequent stalemate disaster) including 2 excellent Halloween specials.

5674529,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Great show.  Can't wait for them to release more seasonal sets.  If you are a fan of the show you won't be disappointed, however there are episodes on the non-seasonal sets that are from later seasons.

If you are looking for a really random show that has plenty of 80's goodness this is a show for you.  As a plus even though the episodes are for the most part stand alone, there are call backs to earlier episodes in some of the later ones as well, just to make sure you were paying attention.

5674533,4,B00BUAJZGY,"I love this show, but this review is on the discs themselves, the Blu-ray seasons 1&2.  It has pleanty of extras, a little weird to see Mordecai's voice, J. G. Quintel, speak since he doesn't talk any different than when he does Mordecai.

The packaging is a little on the plain side, I'll admit, but really I don't care.  I rip these and put them on a box that plugs into my TV and watch them that way.  I don't keep the case on a shelf like a trophy to brag about the media I bought.  The case goes in a box into a closet with the discs in them so I never fault a DVD/Bluray set for shoddy cases.  As long as they protect the discs in shipment I could care less.

Some of the words have been changed, don't know what ones, I know 'Pissed' has been changed to 'Ticked' but that is really the only thing that took away a star.  It doesn't bug me that much but I am a little upset when audio is changed in any kind of media just to make it more kid friendly.

So yeah, I'd recommend the Bluray since it is such high quality.  I ripped them to 720p and it looks great on my 42 inch HDTV.  I hope 3&4 come out the same way, exact same way.  I have my fingers crossed.",1382659200,,1164,3.927350427350427

5674542,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Regular Show is an insane cartoon that I think reaches out to the interests of not only children, but their parents as well. I started watching this show with my daughters simply because it followed Adventure Time (another gem) on Cartoon Network's schedule. The weird references and jokes that are simple enough for the kids to laugh at, but will also appeal to parents that were born in the early '80's. My personal favorite part of Regular show is waiting for the episode to go bat $#!T crazy around the halfway point. No matter how straight forward the story may seem, it will happen.

As for the blu ray collection, you are purchasing both the first and second season in one package. The first season is short so I am happy they released it this way.

Now for the guts: I had my brother over for the weekend, and we watched ALL of the episodes. (He'd never seen the show on TV). So great! We really had fun. This sounds strange, I mean, I KNOW this is a cartoon, right? But the voice actors and the high quality of writing and animation and -  um, you sorta' forget that you are watching a show that has birds and woodland creatures, and huge headed people who use butterscotch lollies as currency and Party Pete and Death and Skips and beautiful Starla and floating big babies who like to rub chocolate cake on each other and.. Benson.. and then, you are laughing and doing Punchies with your brother!

Know who else enjoyed the shows? MY MOM!!!!
OOOOOHHHHHOOOO!!

Please note: I have reported this to the fine Amazon folks & they are shipping replacement DVDs. I will update my review after I get them.

This review is Not for the Regular Show. I haven't been able to watch due to damaged disks. I love Regular Show. It is smart and so funny!

This is the very first time that I received damaged anything from Amazon, and I have been a customer since 2005! (Due to health reasons, I cannot shop at ""brick & mortar"" so nearly everything I buy, I get through Amazon, including food, books, clothing, electronics, computer stuff and movies/tv shows.

I will be interested to find out if the missing commentaries and other missing special features were a once only ""burp"" in the manufacturing process.

The shipping box was not damaged, but even before I opened the box, I could hear that there was a loose DVD. All 3 disks had scratches; disk 1 were so bad, that all 3 dvd players i tried skipped right over the beginning of the DVD.

Anyhow, I think the Regular Show is brilliant. I am looking forward to watching!",1377216000,,1888,4.465116279069767

Cartoon Network; please continue with this type of example (releasing one or two whole seasons at a time) and stop releasing bits and pieces DVDs (Season one Volume 1, Season one Volume 2, Season One Volume 3, Season two Volume 1, Season two Volume 2 etc.)

While you're at it, release the great cartoons from your glory days in a similar fashion. Billy and Mandy, Megas XLR, Foster's, The Eds, Dexter etc.

The slack pack set is still unedited, however I really wanted a full release of the seasons. They edited all sorts of things that gave it the charm that made me start watching it.

5674563,5,B00BUAJZGY,I had a lot of fun watching this. I liked every episode and the special features are kinda cool. I love it.,1375315200,,107,3.909090909090909
5674564,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Cartoon Network promotes Regular Show as ""anything but regular."" That's true in two ways: the show is crazy, quirky and sometimes naughty. But it's ""anything but regular"" due to the fact that more than many current shows, it's traditional in its format of storytelling.

Even though each episode goes from the everyday to the spectacularly insane, that's what the great sitcoms did--both live action and animated. When Lucy Ricardo got starched, lit her nose on fire or got wasted on Vitameatavegemin, each script was constructed from the zany point back to the beginning, which seemed very normal and everyday. Through this exacting process, the most outlandish situations can seem plausible.

That's really what makes it ""anything but regular"" on today's animation landscape, because most modern shows (and films) tell multiple stories rather than linear ones. Since Seinfeld and its contemporaries, there are usually several plot threads that unfold until they converge at the end. Even dramatized biographies now flow in and out of flashbacks and side steps.

So Regular Show is regular and it's not. According to the show's creator, J.G. Quintel, the title indeed teeters between irony and accuracy.

J.G. QUINTEL: Even though it looks completely bizarre, it is just a ""regular show."" Once you get past the way it looks, it is a sitcom you are watching. The title was going to be Regular Show, ""Normal Show"" or ""Weird Show."" ""Normal Show"" was not quite right and 'Weird Show"" was too on the nose.

GREG EHRBAR: What's that sound we hear over the titles in each episode?

J.G.: That is supposed to be the sound of a TV changing channels.  It's as if you're searching through the channels and when you find Regular Show, that's when you stop.

GREG: You and your team have done over 100 episodes and are headed into the fifth season, so the show and characters have evolved. What's cool about watching the original first and second seasons now?

J.G.: You can see how Mordecai and Rigby started out. They aren't the same characters they are now. In Season Two, we started experimenting with Muscle Man. He used to more of a rival of Mordecai and Rigby. Seeing it from the very, very beginning, it feels as if they ""just got here."" Benson is more of the classic boss, really on their case all the time. He has some really awesome freak-outs in Seasons One and Two. It's nice to revisit the original shows that started it all and add to the backstory.

GREG: You say on one of the audio commentaries that you wanted the show to ""sound good"" to adults as well as kids, so it wouldn't grate. Sometimes contemporary TV, especially aimed at kids and daytime audiences, seem to have a mandate to ""keep up the energy,"" which translates often into a constant level of cacophony, rather than the more impactful peaks and valleys of storytelling.

J.G: It is very easy to write a romp, going from ""a"" to ""b"" They want something and they're going to get it so then a car chase and something crazy happens. We've found that it's much stronger to have an emotional element threaded through. They somehow have to care about this thing that they want. There is something emotional at stake, beyond something hollow. That way, it rings true. Everybody has those kinds of feelings and they can relate to it. That in turn makes it more fun to see them go though it.

What we always try to do--and it's really hard--is to make something that you think would have held up for you as a kid, would hold up for kids today and that grownups can find entertaining, hopefully for a long time to come.

GREG: Are some of the stories inspired by real life things?

J.G.: Some of the stories that have happened to us. ""The Power"" is a good example, Mordecai and Rigby are just screwing around, they bust a hole in the wall and have to fix it.  That literally happened with two guys at work. They were wrestling and they slammed their backs into the wall and popped a hole into it. Instead of telling anybody they just covered it up with a bookshelf. The episode we won the Emmy for, ""Eggscellent"" [Season 3] is based on a real restaurant in San Diego that gives you a hat if you eat a twelve egg omelet. I couldn't even get a quarter of the way through.

Food episodes!

GREG: What is the story process for Regular Show?

J.G.:  We have several teams of storyboard artists but in the writer's room where we come up with the concepts. We play this game I played in college where you all sit at a table and come up with fake titles for episodes that sound cool. You throw those into a hat and pull one out at a time. You set a timer for two minutes while you try to write as much of a complete episode as you can. In an hour you can have 125 ideas.

We read them all out loud and any of them that make us laugh and sounds like something that is worth moving forward on, we build around it.  It gets written into an outline with a classic three act structure.  Even though it is animation and you can do almost anything, you can lose the audience if all of a sudden it doesn't make sense. You always have to make sure that you keep them engaged and they ""get"" the story.

GREG: Would you call Mordecai and Rigby ""co-dude-dependent?""

J.G.: They do need each other. I don't think they could ever be ripped apart for too long otherwise they would be incomplete. They definitely have their moments where one of them will piss the other one off but they always come back together before the end of the episode.

GREG: There's a balance that is disrupted if they are separated by an distracting person or event, the way Tom and Jerry were sometimes. Like when Mordecai saw Pops coming out of the shower and can't deal with that image in his mind.

J.G.: Yes, yes.  He just wants to get his friend back.  He accidently wipes his mind.

GREG: The two of them are easily manipulated by TV advertising.

J.G.: That is my favorite--showing just how manipulated and malleable Rigby and Mordacai are to these commercials. They will buy anything. If the commercial is cool enough they are sold. Commercials were really funny to me when I was a kid and I loved video games. I remember which games I thought were cool, so I always try to make sure the games in ""Regular Show"" are the same types of games--and then we usually make fun of them.

GREG: You said that Mordecai is sort of like you in college.

J.G.: Yes, it's true.  I can remember specific things I would do that would get me into really big trouble. My parents would say, ""Why did you do that?"" Honestly in my mind I didn't know, I just did it. Both Mordecai and Rigby have varying levels of intelligence but you can tell that Mordecai is the more responsible one. Rigby is the one that is going to do things without thinking. They keep each other in check.  It's fun to see them play against each other and play with each other and how the stories unfold because of their choices which are always interesting.

GREG: You're the voice of Mordecai. Forgive me for asking, but do you have formal acting training?

J.G.: I remember taking an acting class called ""acting for animators."" When Regular Show came along and I had done the voice for my character in my student film [included on the Blu-ray/DVD] where I was just being myself so that was no big deal. The only thing that was kind of hard for me at the beginning was kind of learning how to yell because I don't really yell in real life, ever, and Mordecai yells a lot when he gets into all these crazy situations. I had to do a couple of big screams to get used to that.

GREG: When you record the voices, do you use a storyboard as a script?

J.G.: We do.  We have a script typed up because it is easier to read in the records but we go off of our storyboards.  We even have a monitor in the record booth showing the storyboard pictures in case anybody is not getting how intense it needs to be. That makes it much easier. Bill Sawyers, Sam Marin, Mark Hamill, me and any others go through the script in a very linear way and then that will be that. Other times if we get people that are on the east coast, we will do phone patches once in awhile.

GREG: The show uses a lot of established songs, like ""Working for the Weekend"" in one of my favorite episodes, ""Free Cake."" How did that come about?

J.G.: When we started producing the show, we were putting in temporary music just to give a feel of what we wanted. I'm a huge fan of 80s so I just put that stuff in. When the executives watched it, someone said it sounded really cool and wanted to know if we wanted them to get the original versions. I didn't think that they would ever suggest that but we actually ended up with them. I'm pumped that we did, because it really colors Regular Show in a unique way. Parents watching it might remember those songs. Kids might not know them, but they'll still think they're still cool songs. A lot of kids comment online that when they hear a certain song, they think of ""Regular Show.""

GREG: I noticed in one of your commentaries, you mentioned that something was traced, and you said, ""Tracing is okay, kids."" That was great, because sometimes a creative interest can be derailed in life by rules that don't always apply in later life.

J.G.: There are a lot of little insights in the commentaries about what we have learned in making cartoons, our process and how it has evolved over time.  It was really fun to get to talk about a lot of that.

GREG: But a successful career isn't just handed to you in real life, is it?

J.G.: No, it is not.  There is a lot of luck involved.  I think you've got to be in the right place at the right time with the right idea that a studio just happens to be looking for and they like it.  Beyond that, you have to be able to make it consistent so people will want to watch it, which can be tough.

GREG: There are a lot of extras on the set--in addition to the commentaries--including a music video with live action people representing the characters. What's the deal with that?

J.G.:  That was really cool. It's from the episode ""Mordecai and the Rigbys,"" when Mordecai lies to Margaret about being in a band and then accidently enrolls himself in this battle of the bands, so he and Rigby have to learn how to play just one song so he won't get caught.  They end up playing this song in the end. In Atlanta, where Cartoon Network is based, they took that song and some of their live action guys just made that video. I watched it and my jaw just dropped and I was laughing so hard.

GREG: In the commentary for ""Death Punchies,"" you say that ""There are things funnier than a fart."" Funny flatulence has been around since Vaudeville, but nowadays it's become the go-to gag for entertainment aimed at kids and teens.

J.G.: It's true. It's kind of cheating in a way. You can do really crass humor and get a laugh but if you take the time to think of a clever way around it so that everybody can enjoy it, that's usually the better way to go. But it's harder to do. It takes more time. Usually we have to work quite long hours to keep it up, even though it would  probably be much easier to just toss in a fart once in a while.

While we really make ""Regular Show"" for ourselves, and a lot of us are in our twenties and thirties, I hope adults won't automatically think, ""Oh, this is for kids and I shouldn't watch it."" That's not true at all.

5674565,5,B00BUAJZGY,I absolutely love this show! The quality of the video is smooth and the sound is crisp. Great to watch while you are sipping on some RADI-COLA. (just don't tell Benson),1374710400,,168,4.451612903225806
5674566,5,B00BUAJZGY,This is the best show ever. Finally a DVD that has season one and two. Plus all the bonus features!,1374624000,3,99,4.0
5674567,1,B00BUAJZGY,"Until Warner addresses and corrects this set to actually provide the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track listed on the box, it's about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.  And merely changing the box to reflect the pitiful, lossy 2.0 stereo mix that's currently on the disc is equally unacceptable, since the HD broadcasts and Netflix episodes both utilize the surround mix.  This is a quality show that deserves the full package, especially not the false advertising that's currently in circulation.",1374451200,11,494,5.012195121951219
5674568,5,B00BUAJZGY,"JG Quintel has created a modern masterpiece. Regular Show is the best animated series since the creation of The Simpsons. The voice talent is original and superb. What I find most appealing is that the writing focuses on good humor as well as a ""few"" off color jokes. Other animated shows, Family Guy in particular, try too hard to be controversial rather than funny.

I was interested in buying the ""Party Pack"" and the other individual DVDs, but Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. really came through and gave fans what they wanted. I hope they will follow with other FULL seasons because this is a show I will collect until the end.

The set contains some cool special features and great, clear audio. I also love the inclusion of the end theme which Cartoon Network dubs over with upcoming show content. The commentary is interesting because this is one of those programs where you may wonder what they were thinking (in a good way).

Hopefully, future DVD collections will contain some live readings from Comic-Con, or more insight into the voice talent. Quintel's short film ""2 in the AM/PM"" would be fantastic too, but that one really isn't for the kids.

Bravo to all involved, thank you for releasing it. Yea-yuh!",1374364800,10,1220,4.767772511848341
5674569,5,B00BUAJZGY,"I'm not one to want too much when it comes to DVDs, so I'm quite content. I'd been craving a season set of this show FOREVER, so to have the first 2 released together made me very happy. I haven't experienced any audio or video issues. The extras included are nifty (my favorite thing is probably the ""The Naive Man from Lolliland"" short). Lots of production stuff included.

A lot of people have been upset by the dialogue edits (replacing the word ""pissed"" with ""ticked""). I personally wasn't all that bothered by it. I understand that a lot of the humor in this show is a bit more risque than what cartoons used to be and that children's comedic sense is more mature than previous generations. However, ""pissed"" is still language considered inappropriate for children to use, so I never particularly agreed with it being used on this show in the first place. So it doesn't make a big deal to me. 5/5 :D",1374278400,,905,4.5182926829268295
5674570,5,B00BUAJZGY,"This DVD is great. You won't be disappointed. There are lots of commentaries, episodes, and special features.  I found something really odd though on the third DVD.  The ""Sam Sings Mystery Karaoke"" had no sound when I tried watching it on my TV. Tried watching it on the PC to see if it would do the same thing and it did. Don't know if it's a glitch on the disc or what, but everything else played perfectly fine.",1374192000,,414,4.294871794871795
5674571,4,B00BUAJZGY,"I think this show is hilarious! But instead of the several excellent audio options listed on the box, this set only comes with dolby digital stereo. I had read that info in another review and really couldn't believe it. I considered canceling my order, but I really do like the show so I let it ride hoping that I wouldn't notice. Unfortunately, while having only stereo sound on a blu-ray set couldn't totally ruin this release of Regular Show, it did noticeably damage it. Regular Show sounds better in the HD broadcast on tv than on this release, so I do feel cheated. I had skipped the earlier dvd releases that were just compilations, hoping that they would release entire seasons and was thrilled to see TWO seasons on blu-ray. But now Cartoon Network DID manage to cheat me on this set. And with one of their BEST shows! Every disc release of Regular Show has been a cheat or a disappointment in some way, which is shameful. I blame only the people involved in how the discs would be created and released, and none of those involved in the creation of the clever and hilarious Regular Show itself. I, and anyone else who bought this set, should receive replacement blu-rays that DO have the audio options that were printed on the package. CBS sent out replacements of a few faulty discs on their Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 3 set, and Cartoon Network now needs to replace the faulty Regular Show discs.

So, to sum up: Regular Show is excellent and incredibly funny, but Cartoon Network has again fumbled the discs that they chose to try to sell. I hope it was just a simple mistake on their part. If so, then send out replacement discs and they have a near-perfect release of a great show. If it was intentional, then again, send out replacement discs and don't pull that kind of nonsense again.",1374192000,,1813,4.561349693251533
5674572,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Pretty lame that all uses of the word ""pissed"" have been dubbed over with ""ticked"" in the box set. Didn't seem to be a problem in the other releases or over the last three years... But what can you do? Good for you, concerned individuals, you've screwed up something else.

Otherwise, pretty much what you would expect. The bonus material is enjoyable.",1374105600,3,352,4.67741935483871

5674574,1,B00BUAJZGY,"Great cartoon, but if you're looking for an uncut collection of episodes you'll have to look elsewhere. Following in the tradition of Beavis and Butthead, Daria, Dragon Ball Z, Ren and Stimpy, and Rocko's Modern Life, yet another amazing cartoon gets a disappointing release.",1374019200,17,275,5.2727272727272725
5674575,5,B00BUAJZGY,"I have already ordered this product, But CN has made a tremendous mistake. Now The episode ""Meat Your Maker"" Will be censored forever.",1374019200,6,134,4.869565217391305
5674576,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Let me start by saying that Regular Show is hands down my favorite cartoon ever produced. I think the format is perfect: 11 minutes of utter insanity and laughs; each episode is almost like an entertainment ""snack"". As a fan of the show, I purchased all of the previously released DVDs, but they left me (and others) wanting. They were random episodes shoehorned into a DVD. Highly disappointing.

Cartoon Network has finally released the first and second seasons on blu-ray, and it's fantastic. All 40 episodes (that's right, 40 freaking episodes!!!) are hilarious--not a dud in the bunch. There's a lot of replay value with each episode, which for me makes it worth buying. On top of that, there are tons of bonus features! They're very interesting, like one of creator JG Quintel pitching the aired pilot episode ""The Power"". Also included is the unaired pilot episode, which was very funny.

I'd definitely recommend this to anyone; this isn't just a kids' show, I promise.",1373932800,,977,4.915151515151515
5674577,5,B00BUAJZGY,regular show is just a good cartoon. but whats even more important is what it did. it restored my faith in CN as a network. sure adventure time is the posterchild of CN and is loved by many (its a cool unique show but i find some of the episodes boring. also it uses songs sung by characters that can come off as cheesy. personally i do enjoy the songs.) AT is a one in a million hit thats just so unique. but regular show proves that these days any cartoon on CN can be good with enough effort and you don't have to be the most creative genius to make a good cartoon! ever since more standard like what use to be on CN in the 2000's have been made. sure theres only 4 or 5 good cartoons but only them are aired! plus the next batch of shows look promising(spread the word about lakewood plaza turbo! its a pilot that hasn't been greenlit yet! its so amazing and CN needs to know people want it as a full show like what happened with steven universe and clarence. btw those two shows are confirmed for 2013! but LPT is an 80's style street fighter/dbz comedy/action cartoon! if that sounds awsome but your worried its not good go search the pilot!) anyways more on regular show. it follows a formula but its not reperitive in the least! every episode starts off like any normal day and turns into over the top adventure! and they are all so creative and different! also the characters and voice acting are great! there are so many funny and quotable lines! and im sure this set will fit any collectors needs!,1373673600,,1508,4.276223776223776
5674578,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Regular Show is a Unique cartoon that really puts cartoon network back on the good end of cartoon quality,along with Adventure Time. This DVD/Blu-Ray Release looks to be the best one so far! I am Glad they have decided to put not one,but two seasons in a box set together. All 40 Original Episodes from the two seasons are told to be contained in this release. The Special Features also sound amazing too. Like the Original Pilot version of the season two episode ""First Day"" ,the J.G.Quintel Interview, or the commentary on all 40 Episodes. That's Right,All 40!!! I would recommend purchasing this set when it comes out on July 16th if you're a fan of the show or you want to check it out.",1372377600,,690,4.528

5674580,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Finally after months of crying they did it! They have not only released season 1 of Regular Show, but season 2 as well! There is a God!

This show is simply hilarious! So many funny jokes that only adults can get, and simply one of the best animation programs Cartoon Network has had. This and Adventure Time is what's keeping Cartoon Network Alive.",1370044800,,349,4.5396825396825395

5674582,5,B00BUAJZGY,"I was born one month before the creation of Cartoon Network. I grew up on cartoons and still watch them more than anything now. I have loved most of CN's lineup throughout my life, but Regular Show is the most enjoyable cartoon I have ever seen produced.

Anyway, about the hardware. I watch Regular Show on CN HD, and have never batted an eye. But I bought the ""Best DVD of All Time"", unknowingly in standard definition, and it was a HUGE difference.

So my advice: if you have the means, of course buy Blu Ray.

(case is awesome too)",1368316800,3,535,4.33
5674583,1,B00BUAJZGY,"No offence guys, Regular Show isn't a good cartoon at all. It's way too repetitive, with uninspired fighting scenes happening on every freaking episodes.
I don't get why critics say this is a masterpiece, if you're looking for a good television cartoon series try to watch ""The Amazing world of Gumball"", ""Adventure Time"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" or ""Ducktales"": now those ARE good cartoons.
Skip Regular Show unless you're under fifteen years old.",1368316800,4,450,5.178082191780822

5674586,5,B00BUAJZGY,"I just started watching this series on Netflix instant watch and it's the best cartoon I've seen in a while, for any age. It is naive, absurd and refreshing. I can't wait to be able to watch the whole series on these upcoming dvd sets; unlike the current dvd sets that only have selected episodes from each season... lame! They should bring out seasons 3 & 4 in this format, also.",1365206400,5,380,4.366197183098592

5674588,5,B00BUAJZGY,"Slack Pack, Best DVD In The World, The Party Pack.

All 3 of those DVD's I just mentioned? Completely and utterly pointless.

FINALLY Cartoon Network with the little of intelligence they have left in their skulls, ( Why'd you make Johnny Bravo, Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Dexter's Lab DVD's and only put out 1 season each? ) and bring Regular Show aka. the best show on TV next to Breaking Bad on a complete DVD/Blu Ray release.

For about 1 dollar per episode on crisp clear Blu Ray sounds good to me. Bring it on!",1363996800,5,518,4.375

The commentary is difficult to hear in general and the episodes play too loud behind them. That's alright, though, because Quintel and the voice actors don't say anything too interesting. They usually just laugh at their own jokes. The only people with anything to say were the artists and storyboarders and there was some neat stuff to learn.
