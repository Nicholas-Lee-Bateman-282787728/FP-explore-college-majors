8044930,5,B00076ON7S,I do not agree with the previous ratings. This is a very informative program showing and comenting how medical hypnosis works and how it is done. It does teach you how to do it.,1146096000,,177,4.235294117647059
8044931,1,B00076ON7S,"It is a home-made video, where the person with no medical education tries to teach you MEDICAL hypnosis. I am not sure he knows the basics of anatomy, physiology and/or pathology. The movie is very unprofessional. Quality of the video is very poor. The content is not the same as the title. The title is what sells this DVD, but not the DVD itself.

This DVD was a complete waste of my money. Unfortunately, Amazon does not refund the money for opened DVDs. It is sad that Amazon even accepts items for sale like this one. But if you still want to waste your money for this DVD, I will sell it to you for $5 (all it's worth).

I can recommend: ""Heal Yourself With Medical Hypnosis: The Most Immediate Way to Use Your Mind-Body Connection!"" by Andrew Weil, MD, and Steven, Ph. D. Gurgevich (Audio CD - September 2005)
