3058114,5,B00111HWTE,"The Emigrants / The New Land traces a Swedish farming familys voyage to America in the mid-19th century and their efforts to put down roots in a beautiful but forbidding new world. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as Karl-Oskar and Kristina, a couple who encounter one physical and emotional trial after another.

To support their growing family and their parents, Karl-Oskar and Kristina live a hard life in the Sweden of the 1840s. Winters are brutal, harvests are often ruined by drought, and Karl-Oskars plow repeatedly breaks. The marriage is not exactly blissful, either. Karl-Oskar dreams about going to America, where hes heard that everyone owns vast, fertile lands.

The Emigrants is a trilogy: the departure from Sweden, the voyage overseas, and the journey to and settlement in Minnesota The New Land. Though Minnesotas winters and summers are more extreme than Swedens, the immigrants are rewarded for their hard work. They live a better life than they did in Sweden. Bad times also come. The Civil War begins and the Sioux Indians rise up against the white settlers.

Director Jan Troell tells a universal story of the immigrant experience by focusing on a single family. He is especially effective at showing the culture shock faced by the newcomers, their gradual acclimation to American life, and the ways in which they deal with unforeseen hardships. Both von Sydow and Ullman capture the uncertainty of what to expect along with hope that this new young country will offer them a more fulfilling life.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a new introduction by theatre and film critic John Simon; new conversation between film scholar Peter Cowie and director Jan Troell; new interview with actress Liv Ullmann; To Paint With Pictures, a 2005 hour-long documentary on the making of the films; trailers; and a critical essay. Both films are in Swedish, with English subtitles.",1454803200,29,1904,5.054140127388535
3058115,5,B00111HWTE,"I was the first executive director of the Sundance Institute, and in 1982 we invited Jan Troell to visit Sundance and screen both films. Troell felt out of place with some of the Hollywood crowd, but the filmmaking fellows were astonished at the honesty and brilliance of these two remarkable films. They are among my handful of favorite films of all time.",1454371200,27,356,4.758064516129032
3058116,5,B00111HWTE,"One of the most memorable movie-going experiences in my life occurred at an up-scale Grindhouse movie theatre in Palo Alto, California. Upscale, number one because it was in Palo Alto, but also because it provided fine meals between showings.  A Grindhouse because it only played matinees, usually B-rated samurai or martial arts films. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon. That particular day, they played Jan Troels The Emigrants and The New Land, back to back, with dinner to boot.

There have been few times before or since where I have been so overwhelmed by the meticulous detail of human drama shown on the big screen. The epic scope of these films simply blew me away. These movies have strong, convincing performances by Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman, both in their prime, and breath-taking cinematography by Jan Troell, the director.

 European filmmakers have a particular skill at story-telling. The plot is relatively simple. These two films document the story of a family emigrating and settling in America in the 1800s. Simply told, the experiences of Karl-Oscar (Von Sydow) and Kristina (Ullman) will keep you glued to the screen. The combined length of these two films exceed six and a half hours, but you will be on the edge of your seat as I was many years ago, not noticing the time.

Finding these films on DVD was another story. The Emigrants and The New Land were released on VHS, but the releases were cheesily dubbed in English. They weren't even dubbed by Von Sydow or Ullman, both highly conversant in English.

These movies have always been available on DVD   you can find them on Amazon.uk  but without English subtitles.

Until now. At long last, they are available to English speaking viewers. This release is long overdue.

This new Criterion Edition has the two films, plus bonus material:

New high-definition digital restorations of both films, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks on the Blu-rays

New introduction by theater and film critic John Simon

New conversation between film scholar Peter Cowie and director Jan Troell

New interview with actor Liv Ullmann

To Paint with Pictures, an hour-long documentary from 2005 on the making of the films, featuring archival footage as well as interviews with Troell, Ullmann, producer and co-screenwriter Bengt Forslund, actor Eddie Axberg, and composer Georg Oddner
Trailers

New English subtitle translations

An essay by critic Terrence Rafferty.

But forget the bonus materials. Just watch the movies. The Emigrants was nominated for best picture and THe New Land was nominated for Best Foreign Film by the Academy but neither sadly won. These films are certainly the best achievements of Jan Troell, and are among the best European cinema from the Seventies. You will not be disappointed.",1452124800,91,2780,5.083700440528634

3058118,5,B00111HWTE,"These two 3-hour movies are great! Unfortunately they only have Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian languages.
No English, and no subtitles, so unless you speak Swedish/Danish/Norwegian they won't be enjoyable.

But if you do, I really recommed them. They are so realistic, showing how hard life was in mid-1800's Sweden, and the 10-week trip on a tall ship to America, the trip across the USA, and finding their piece of heaven in Minnesota. These poeple were tough! Diseases took the life of a few of them, but they struggled on.
Very educational movies especially for Americans/Canadians with European roots, it really shows what our ancestors went thru in search of a better life.

My parents and grandparents emigrated from a Northern European nation, and this film gave me a deep appreciation for the types of things they suffered in their lives in their country and also the difficult journey it was to establish their home in a new land.  It was a very moving film, upsetting at times, rightly so. Superb acting, costumes, makeup, sets, props. Very realistic.  Great story.  Slow moving and captivating.

Beautifully shot and so historically accurate, it stays so true to the books by Wilhelm Moberg. You don't have to have Swedish roots to enjoy these films. If you like the history of our emigrant founded country and a wonderful journey of a family, you will love these films. I was totally enthralled the entire 6 plus hours. Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman are in peak form in these films. Eddie Axberg as Robert was wonderful. Highly recommended!",1500854400,2,723,4.569230769230769

3058127,5,B00111HWTE,"If you only see one film in your life, make sure it is The Emigrants/The New Land, which is really one very long film broken into two parts.  It has taken 46 years to bring an uncut English subtitled version to DVD and blu ray, and it is well worth purchasing.  I had a Warner Home Video VHS release which was severely cut, formatted for TV size, dubbed in English and with no captions.  To make it even worse, the picture was of very poor quality.  To be able to watch the stunning sharp clear film in widescreen on a big screen TV is an experience never to be missed.

The story, of a young family, the Nilssons, emigrating from a harsh farming life in Sweden with its severely  restrictive social structure, moves very slowly yet never for one minute drags.  The images are beautiful with many long shots showing tiny figures in a vast landscape.  Dialog is only spoken when really necessary, and in some parts there is no spoken dialog at all, such as when one character is remembering his harrowing journey to the  California gold fields.  After watching the films, I watched them through again from beginning to end and noticed many things i had not noticed the first time.  Like a good book that you put down so that you can look forward to picking it up again next day, I found myself pausing the disc to take a break knowing I would be back with the Nilssons later.

The Emigrants follows the decision to leave Sweden and the harrowing journey to the US and on to  Minnesota.  The New Land deals with what happens when they get there and have to build a shelter, clear the land, grow all their own food, and  become established homesteaders.  non stop grinding labor with nothing to fall back on other than their own resources.  Some succeed, some don't. Many die on the journey.  It is a hard life.  The image which stays with me is the very last one where we see a sepia photo of Karl Oscar Nislsson, now named Charles Nelson.  As the camera pans away, his family come into the frame and he has nine children, their spouses and about a dozen grandchildren standing in front of the farmhouse.  The Nelson family are now established.",1493856000,2,2142,4.441025641025641

3058138,5,B00111HWTE,"Vilhelm Moberg's four Emigrants books, and the movies based on them -- ""The Emigrants"" and ""The New Land"" -- have captured my imagination for years because my own ancestors came to America from Sweden during the late 1800s. Though they came over on steamships, and not the sailing vessels of the 1850s like in the books and movie, a lot of their experiences in leaving their homeland and making a home in the new land had to be similar.

I previously had DVDs of The Emigrants and The New Land which I had burned from old borrowed VHS tapes. It was good to have the movies to watch anytime, but as one can imagine the quality was poor. So it was delightfully refreshing to finally get this high-definition digitally restored DVD version. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Emigrants movies again (twice) since they arrived, and am pleased to report that the quality is high. The restoration work by Svensk Filmindustri is to be commended. You won't ever find yourself saying ""this movie looks (or sounds) too old and grainy"" or anything like that.

An added bonus is the third disc providing new interviews with, among others, director Jan Troell, producer Bengt Forslund, Actor Eddie Axberg (Robert Nilsson), and actress Liv Ullman (Kristina Johansdotter Nilsson). My one disappointment with Ullman's interview is where she flippantly compared the important Swedish migration to America of the 1800s to the modern ""migrant"" crisis where millions of Islamic Muslim immigrants from throughout the Middle East and Africa are swarming into Western Europe -- not because they are war ""refugees,"" or are looking to work (like all Swedes did in America), but because they are engaging in the Islamic invasion ritual of hijrah, and to perpetually sponge free benefits from Western European taxpayers. And to engage in jihad once in Europe. Bad observation, Liv.",1476662400,5,1858,5.009708737864078
3058139,5,B00111HWTE,"Ditto to all the wonderful comments in the other 5-star reviews here.  Would like to add that this film is not for the immature/short attention span crowd.  Sad, but true - they can't appreciate a film like this.",1476144000,3,212,4.552631578947368

My husband became fascinated with the story in the song...researched it and read all 4 books.  When we found out there was a dvd with the story we had to have it.  We intended to watch it a little at a time but couldn't stop watching...we watched all 6 hrs at once!  The subtitles were great...not a distraction at all.

3058142,5,B00111HWTE,"If it was possible I would give this set of movies six or more stars.  I cannot tell you how deeply the story moves me. Three of my great grandparents came from Sweden shortly after this story took place and this gives me a glimpse of what their lives may have been like. I purchased the books on Amazon shortly after I came back from Sweden five years ago. My training as a forester allowed me to see Sweden in a way that is different from many who might visit there. It was very easy to picture what the story because it was described by Moberg in very vivid terms. I had spent a week with a friend that live in a small town in east central Sweden by the name of Bergsj. I was also able to visit the city of Sderhamn, the port city from which my great grandmother Edla Nordstrom left from in 1890 to come to the US. Moberg tells the story as being in southwest Sweden's Smland region. After I read the books I was speaking with my friend from Bergsj and he told me that I was actually correct to visualize the story in his region since it based on events from Moberg's family's history and the Moberg family came from the area northwest of Bergsj and the actually left for the US from Sderhamn! No wonder I was able to imagine the trip so well as I had actually just been in the region the book was written from.

My appreciation for my ancestors grew enormously from reading the books. This week I finally received my copy of The Emigrants and The New Land. I was mesmerized. There was an even deeper sense of connectedness with characters after watching the movies. Maybe there is some genetic memory that I carry from Sweden. The books and movies have created a deep sense of satisfaction for me on every level. I read a lot and watch many very excellent movies, but I do not think anything to date has moved me as deeply as these. If you are still connected to your ancestors and their journeys these will resonate deeply with you as well. If you're even a smidgen Swedish you will feel as you've gone back in time to live a few hours of your past. Buy the books and movies. You will not be disappointed.",1472601600,10,2110,4.246268656716418

""The New Land"" is a bit of a disappointment.  I have not read the books, so I don't know if the same thing happens in them during the second half, but this film slides into an increasingly sad tone.  It fails to adequately present the wide range of their lives, and seems to focus intensively on the losses and hardships almost exclusively.

Whereupon I removed The New Land disc to get to the one below it, assuming without close examination that the one below was The Emigrants, and inserted that in first my computer drive (Windows 7) and then a DVD player. Except that the set-up menu then had no selection by which to play the movie! The two movie titles were on top of the set-up menu, but couldn't be selected. All that could be selected was an introduction, two interviews, an essay piece, and the trailers.

3058164,5,B00111HWTE,"This film is truly one of the quintessential films ever made about America. Released roughly the same time as the Godfather, Troell captures with such cinematic grace, the shared experiences of westward immigration. Think of a more subdued John Ford epic. The journey from Sweden to America depicted in this film is certainly a similar shared experience of most 19th century European immigration- poverty, religion and dreams of a better life in the idealized new land- and the harshness of transit, longing for home and the shear tenacity to survive and make a new life under less than ideal circumstances. The dramatization of the Dakota uprising of 1862 (an event often overshadowed by the simultaneous events of the Civil War) are expertly and thoughtfully depicted as the settlers are swept up in the wholly American historical tide of change of the day. The beauty of this film is the time it takes to unfold. Troell is in no hurry to forward the story without lingering on dramatic landscape shots, flying geese, or plowing through the mud. The performances are astonishing- Von Sydow and Ullmann certainly but Monica Zetterlund as Ulrika, and Hans Alfredson as Jonas Petter. The strength of the story is certainly Vilhelm Moberg's four volume epic which is available in translation for American readers. Moberg hand picked Troell to transform these wonderful books to screen. This is a movie that will warrant many repeated viewings. Not just to re-live and contemplate the enormity of the story and the astounding performances of the entire cast, but to linger in the sweet gentle moments of family and nature that Troell, who is also cinematographer, captured so beautifully. I dare say there is an urgency in its message as well in the context of the current refugee crisis in the world and Americas struggle with its current immigration issues, but those matters may best be discussed elsewhere.  Criterion once again delivers a home run in this release, one that ought to be required viewing for fans of epic films and those with interest in the American immigrant experience.",1458172800,16,2089,5.020172910662824

All I can say is WOW. I started The Emigrants thinking I was in for just any old movie, I was wrong. I was captivated from the start. I watched and watched and watched both films straight through and am now working on very little sleep as a result. This movie is gripping. You really feel as if you are there with the characters throughout their adventures and nightmares.

Let's never forget the reasons why our forbearers made that life-changing decision; nor should we resent those who seek a better life today.  I have just placed my order.

It is a bonus that one of the greatest of film critics, John Simon, is involved in a conversation with the director Jan Troell.  Several people have commented here on the wonderful performances of Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman.  I also want to single out the superb acting of Eddie Axberg as Robert whose story-within-this-story is heartbreaking.  The New Land has an insert in the film where Robert and his companion leave Minnesota for the West and encounter every travail imaginable.  When Robert returns home, a broken man, his brother Karl-Oskar won't believe his tales.  I won't give any more away.

3292611,5,B00111HWTE,"The Emigrants / The New Land traces a Swedish farming familys voyage to America in the mid-19th century and their efforts to put down roots in a beautiful but forbidding new world. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as Karl-Oskar and Kristina, a couple who encounter one physical and emotional trial after another.

To support their growing family and their parents, Karl-Oskar and Kristina live a hard life in the Sweden of the 1840s. Winters are brutal, harvests are often ruined by drought, and Karl-Oskars plow repeatedly breaks. The marriage is not exactly blissful, either. Karl-Oskar dreams about going to America, where hes heard that everyone owns vast, fertile lands.

The Emigrants is a trilogy: the departure from Sweden, the voyage overseas, and the journey to and settlement in Minnesota The New Land. Though Minnesotas winters and summers are more extreme than Swedens, the immigrants are rewarded for their hard work. They live a better life than they did in Sweden. Bad times also come. The Civil War begins and the Sioux Indians rise up against the white settlers.

Director Jan Troell tells a universal story of the immigrant experience by focusing on a single family. He is especially effective at showing the culture shock faced by the newcomers, their gradual acclimation to American life, and the ways in which they deal with unforeseen hardships. Both von Sydow and Ullman capture the uncertainty of what to expect along with hope that this new young country will offer them a more fulfilling life.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a new introduction by theatre and film critic John Simon; new conversation between film scholar Peter Cowie and director Jan Troell; new interview with actress Liv Ullmann; To Paint With Pictures, a 2005 hour-long documentary on the making of the films; trailers; and a critical essay.

Troell felt out of place with some of the Hollywood crowd, but the filmmaking fellows were astonished at the honesty and brilliance of these two remarkable films. They are among my handful of favorite films of all time.",1454371200,27,356,4.758064516129032
3292613,5,B00111HWTE,"One of the most memorable movie-going experiences in my life occurred at an up-scale Grindhouse movie theatre in Palo Alto, California. Upscale, number one because it was in Palo Alto, but also because it provided fine meals between showings.  A Grindhouse because it only played matinees, usually B-rated samurai or martial arts films. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon. That particular day, they played Jan Troels The Emigrants and The New Land, back to back, with dinner to boot.

There have been few times before or since where I have been so overwhelmed by the meticulous detail of human drama shown on the big screen. The epic scope of these films simply blew me away. These movies have strong, convincing performances by Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman, both in their prime, and breath-taking cinematography by Jan Troell, the director.

 European filmmakers have a particular skill at story-telling. The plot is relatively simple. These two films document the story of a family emigrating and settling in America in the 1800s. Simply told, the experiences of Karl-Oscar (Von Sydow) and Kristina (Ullman) will keep you glued to the screen. The combined length of these two films exceed six and a half hours, but you will be on the edge of your seat as I was many years ago, not noticing the time.

Finding these films on DVD was another story. The Emigrants and The New Land were released on VHS, but the releases were cheesily dubbed in English. They weren't even dubbed by Von Sydow or Ullman, both highly conversant in English.

These movies have always been available on DVD   you can find them on Amazon.uk  but without English subtitles.

Until now. At long last, they are available to English speaking viewers. This release is long overdue.

This new Criterion Edition has the two films, plus bonus material:

New high-definition digital restorations of both films, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks on the Blu-rays

New introduction by theater and film critic John Simon

New conversation between film scholar Peter Cowie and director Jan Troell

New interview with actor Liv Ullmann

To Paint with Pictures, an hour-long documentary from 2005 on the making of the films, featuring archival footage as well as interviews with Troell, Ullmann, producer and co-screenwriter Bengt Forslund, actor Eddie Axberg, and composer Georg Oddner
Trailers

New English subtitle translations

An essay by critic Terrence Rafferty.

But forget the bonus materials. Just watch the movies. The Emigrants was nominated for best picture and THe New Land was nominated for Best Foreign Film by the Academy but neither sadly won. These films are certainly the best achievements of Jan Troell, and are among the best European cinema from the Seventies. You will not be disappointed.",1452124800,91,2780,5.083700440528634

But if you do, I really recommed them. They are so realistic, showing how hard life was in mid-1800's Sweden, and the 10-week trip on a tall ship to America, the trip across the USA, and finding their piece of heaven in Minnesota. These poeple were tough! Diseases took the life of a few of them, but they struggled on.
Very educational movies especially for Americans/Canadians with European roots, it really shows what our ancestors went thru in search of a better life.

3292624,5,B00111HWTE,"If you only see one film in your life, make sure it is The Emigrants/The New Land, which is really one very long film broken into two parts.  It has taken 46 years to bring an uncut English subtitled version to DVD and blu ray, and it is well worth purchasing.  I had a Warner Home Video VHS release which was severely cut, formatted for TV size, dubbed in English and with no captions.  To make it even worse, the picture was of very poor quality.  To be able to watch the stunning sharp clear film in widescreen on a big screen TV is an experience never to be missed.

The story, of a young family, the Nilssons, emigrating from a harsh farming life in Sweden with its severely  restrictive social structure, moves very slowly yet never for one minute drags.  The images are beautiful with many long shots showing tiny figures in a vast landscape.  Dialog is only spoken when really necessary, and in some parts there is no spoken dialog at all, such as when one character is remembering his harrowing journey to the  California gold fields.  After watching the films, I watched them through again from beginning to end and noticed many things i had not noticed the first time.  Like a good book that you put down so that you can look forward to picking it up again next day, I found myself pausing the disc to take a break knowing I would be back with the Nilssons later.

The Emigrants follows the decision to leave Sweden and the harrowing journey to the US and on to  Minnesota.  The New Land deals with what happens when they get there and have to build a shelter, clear the land, grow all their own food, and  become established homesteaders.  non stop grinding labor with nothing to fall back on other than their own resources.  Some succeed, some don't. Many die on the journey.  It is a hard life.  The image which stays with me is the very last one where we see a sepia photo of Karl Oscar Nislsson, now named Charles Nelson.  As the camera pans away, his family come into the frame and he has nine children, their spouses and about a dozen grandchildren standing in front of the farmhouse.  The Nelson family are now established.",1493856000,2,2142,4.441025641025641

3292635,5,B00111HWTE,"Vilhelm Moberg's four Emigrants books, and the movies based on them -- ""The Emigrants"" and ""The New Land"" -- have captured my imagination for years because my own ancestors came to America from Sweden during the late 1800s. Though they came over on steamships, and not the sailing vessels of the 1850s like in the books and movie, a lot of their experiences in leaving their homeland and making a home in the new land had to be similar.

I previously had DVDs of The Emigrants and The New Land which I had burned from old borrowed VHS tapes. It was good to have the movies to watch anytime, but as one can imagine the quality was poor. So it was delightfully refreshing to finally get this high-definition digitally restored DVD version. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Emigrants movies again (twice) since they arrived, and am pleased to report that the quality is high. The restoration work by Svensk Filmindustri is to be commended. You won't ever find yourself saying ""this movie looks (or sounds) too old and grainy"" or anything like that.

An added bonus is the third disc providing new interviews with, among others, director Jan Troell, producer Bengt Forslund, Actor Eddie Axberg (Robert Nilsson), and actress Liv Ullman (Kristina Johansdotter Nilsson). My one disappointment with Ullman's interview is where she flippantly compared the important Swedish migration to America of the 1800s to the modern ""migrant"" crisis where millions of Islamic Muslim immigrants from throughout the Middle East and Africa are swarming into Western Europe -- not because they are war ""refugees,"" or are looking to work (like all Swedes did in America), but because they are engaging in the Islamic invasion ritual of hijrah, and to perpetually sponge free benefits from Western European taxpayers. And to engage in jihad once in Europe. Bad observation, Liv.",1476662400,5,1858,5.009708737864078

3292639,5,B00111HWTE,"If it was possible I would give this set of movies six or more stars.  I cannot tell you how deeply the story moves me. Three of my great grandparents came from Sweden shortly after this story took place and this gives me a glimpse of what their lives may have been like. I purchased the books on Amazon shortly after I came back from Sweden five years ago. My training as a forester allowed me to see Sweden in a way that is different from many who might visit there. It was very easy to picture what the story because it was described by Moberg in very vivid terms. I had spent a week with a friend that live in a small town in east central Sweden by the name of Bergsj. I was also able to visit the city of Sderhamn, the port city from which my great grandmother Edla Nordstrom left from in 1890 to come to the US. Moberg tells the story as being in southwest Sweden's Smland region. After I read the books I was speaking with my friend from Bergsj and he told me that I was actually correct to visualize the story in his region since it based on events from Moberg's family's history and the Moberg family came from the area northwest of Bergsj and the actually left for the US from Sderhamn! No wonder I was able to imagine the trip so well as I had actually just been in the region the book was written from.

My appreciation for my ancestors grew enormously from reading the books. This week I finally received my copy of The Emigrants and The New Land. I was mesmerized. There was an even deeper sense of connectedness with characters after watching the movies. Maybe there is some genetic memory that I carry from Sweden. The books and movies have created a deep sense of satisfaction for me on every level. I read a lot and watch many very excellent movies, but I do not think anything to date has moved me as deeply as these. If you are still connected to your ancestors and their journeys these will resonate deeply with you as well. If you're even a smidgen Swedish you will feel as you've gone back in time to live a few hours of your past. Buy the books and movies.

Whereupon I removed The New Land disc to get to the one below it, assuming without close examination that the one below was The Emigrants, and inserted that in first my computer drive (Windows 7) and then a DVD player. Except that the set-up menu then had no selection by which to play the movie! The two movie titles were on top of the set-up menu, but couldn't be selected.

Director and cinematographer being the same person is (too) rare in filmmaking. Apart from being gorgeous the pictures couple the nature and surroundings with the drama and actors in a unique way. For the viewer this can result in a strong feeling of presence in the events. You might almost smell the leaves in the trees and feel the afternoon sunrays on your face.

3292661,5,B00111HWTE,"This film is truly one of the quintessential films ever made about America. Released roughly the same time as the Godfather, Troell captures with such cinematic grace, the shared experiences of westward immigration. Think of a more subdued John Ford epic. The journey from Sweden to America depicted in this film is certainly a similar shared experience of most 19th century European immigration- poverty, religion and dreams of a better life in the idealized new land- and the harshness of transit, longing for home and the shear tenacity to survive and make a new life under less than ideal circumstances. The dramatization of the Dakota uprising of 1862 (an event often overshadowed by the simultaneous events of the Civil War) are expertly and thoughtfully depicted as the settlers are swept up in the wholly American historical tide of change of the day. The beauty of this film is the time it takes to unfold. Troell is in no hurry to forward the story without lingering on dramatic landscape shots, flying geese, or plowing through the mud. The performances are astonishing- Von Sydow and Ullmann certainly but Monica Zetterlund as Ulrika, and Hans Alfredson as Jonas Petter. The strength of the story is certainly Vilhelm Moberg's four volume epic which is available in translation for American readers. Moberg hand picked Troell to transform these wonderful books to screen. This is a movie that will warrant many repeated viewings. Not just to re-live and contemplate the enormity of the story and the astounding performances of the entire cast, but to linger in the sweet gentle moments of family and nature that Troell, who is also cinematographer, captured so beautifully. I dare say there is an urgency in its message as well in the context of the current refugee crisis in the world and Americas struggle with its current immigration issues, but those matters may best be discussed elsewhere.  Criterion once again delivers a home run in this release, one that ought to be required viewing for fans of epic films and those with interest in the American immigrant experience.",1458172800,16,2089,5.020172910662824

I watched and watched and watched both films straight through and am now working on very little sleep as a result. This movie is gripping. You really feel as if you are there with the characters throughout their adventures and nightmares.

Let's never forget the reasons why our forbearers made that life-changing decision; nor should we resent those who seek a better life today.  I have just placed my order.  These films left an indelible impression on me when I first saw them decades ago.

It is a bonus that one of the greatest of film critics, John Simon, is involved in a conversation with the director Jan Troell.  Several people have commented here on the wonderful performances of Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman.  I also want to single out the superb acting of Eddie Axberg as Robert whose story-within-this-story is heartbreaking.  The New Land has an insert in the film where Robert and his companion leave Minnesota for the West and encounter every travail imaginable.  When Robert returns home, a broken man, his brother Karl-Oskar won't believe his tales.  I won't give any more away.

8239824,5,B00111HWTE,"Exceptional two films that are well worth the six hour investment. Watched it in increments over a week. Hard to believe these films were made some 45 yrs ago. Criterion did a wonderful job restoring the films that are depicted in Swedish with English subtitles. Swedish language is easy on the ear and gives a genuine flavor to the viewing experience.

I'm a big fan of European films for their honest, simple and humble qualities, no fake happy endings to appease a political agenda, very realistic. The Emigrants and The New Land do not disappoint.

The topic of emigration -and immigration- is very pertinent in today's western world. As other reviewers have written, it's a story of a Swedish family and their fellow friends who left their homeland for a new and hopefully better life in America in the mid 1800's. Story takes them from a rural Swedish village to an exhausting overseas voyage, arrival in NY and then on a train to Minnesota where other emigrant Swedes had already settled. They come across as a kind, conscientious and hard working people.

It's one of those journey movies where you view the characters as young people and watch them grow, develop, experience some horrendous hardships -and joys- over their lifetimes. It was beautifully filmed in an informal slow style - much of it was filmed in Sweden in its rugged landscape, snow and isolation. I had a particular affinity for the Arvid character, a big kind hearted man who was Robert's loyal friend. Robert, being the younger brother of Karl Oskar who was the natural leader of the group. Characters were well acted and developed, Karl Oskar, his kind wife, Kristina and sassy friend, Ulrika. Restless Robert was always searching but never found his niche in life. I wonder what happened to the young girl he once liked? The young Swedish children featured in these films were absolutely adorable, so natural and unaffected.

The films were bittersweet however. Much was gained and much was lost. Not all found success, some were brutally murdered.

Note: graphic violence in the second film against the Scandinavian settlers at the end (chapter 16+) depicting the violent Sioux Uprising in Minnesota. Wish I could unsee these gruesome scenes.

These films made me realize how fast life can change and those who adapted, fared pretty well. The emigration in this film took place before modern transportation, communications, photographs, mass education so when people left, it was a huge risk and it was permanent. That premise alone is terrifying. Very different circumstances and attitudes from today's immigrants. Swedes then were grateful and eagerly assimilated, leaving behind old world ways that no longer fit. It's a tribute to our US ancestors whose courage, faith, resilience and extreme hard work have given us, their ancestors, the opportunities and lifestyle we are afforded today.

I highly recommend these films, should be mandatory viewing in schools today and part of US Citizenship classes. It is a useful angle at which to view the US. The early part of the movie where they were speaking excitedly about prospects in the US was very endearing. Makes a person very proud and grateful for so many things that we take for granted today eg., govt, laws, protections, freedoms, electricity, running water, food on demand, heating, medical science.. whereas people then were dying of maladies that today are cured with meds.",1518825600,,3419,5.030035335689046

As much as I favor cinematic authenticity, the English version was excellently done, with the exact same cast of actors who like many Swedes are quite comfortable in English doing a faithfully translated script.
Other than the language this is a superb rendering to Blu-Ray of the epic, two-part story covering several decades in Sweden and in America with gorgeous photography, great acting, full character development and very competent directing.  Although somewhat slow moving by modern and American standards, the picture does try to show things also from the side of the Eastern Sioux, the prior inhabitants who ultimately were driven from the State of Minnesota after staging a bloody uprising while the Civil War was raging far to the south.",1505088000,,1027,5.101190476190476
