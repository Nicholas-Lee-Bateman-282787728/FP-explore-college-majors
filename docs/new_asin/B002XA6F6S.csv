8383549,4,B002XA6F6S,"Purchased this Blu-ray at a recent soccer convention. I'd rate it 3.5 stars, but that's not a choice, so I rounded to 4.

Basically, this DVD covers dribbling, juggling, control from the ground and air, and controlling to take a shot. There is a brief narration introducing each exercise  and the players are shown repeatedly performing the skills.

Pros:
- Something for every skill level. Most drills are best for intermediate and above skill levels, but many of the dribbling exercises are appropriate for beginners as well.
- The players are actually using correct form. I cannot tell you how many videos I see where the coach explains a skill, then shows an example of ""good"" execution where the player is actually doing it wrong. As someone else mentioned, these are highly skilled players, and they perform the drills as they are meant to be done. In fact, the basic dribbling sections show the ""chop"" movement of straight forward dribbling better than any demo I have ever seen.
- The section on juggling while off balance is good for emulating a game like effect, and I have not seen a similar idea on any other instructional DVD out there.
- Uses progressions for most of the drills to advance from less proficient to more proficient.
- Efficient, concept-based explanations - they tell you what the exercise is and what its purpose is without going down tedious tangents on the finer points.

Cons:
- Because this is more of a progression based DVD, there is not a lot of original content. Realistically, there are only maybe 10 different exercises; it's just that several of them have progressions to each one.
-  The pace for each exercise is a little slow, yet the pace of the overall video is a little fast. Wish there was more unique content (but I suppose then there would not have been a part two.
- They say all exercises could be played with just a ball and a wall, but I disagree. I would say that cones and some type of goal would be needed to effectively implement most of these exercises.

Bottom Line:
It's not the worst thing out there. The information is good, and the camera work is excellent. I'd say this is most suited for intermediate level coaches.",1330214400,2,2181,4.651948051948052
