I mean...how boring would 'that' be if it wasn't that way?

The other reviewer on this page thinks this is one of the worst movies every made.
I wholeheartedly disagree.
I love Jack Benny and this movie, while not an award-winner, is a pleasant 1939 excursion...exactly what it intended to be.

There must be 'some' reason why it has a 7.0 current rating on IMDB (which is quite high).
For the Benny completist, it's a must.

Decide for yourself. Don't listen to him, or even me for that matter. :)",1273968000,4,571,4.524271844660194
8102476,1,B000CZ31NQ,"I'll be blunt: This is one of the worst films ever made.  The script is pathetic, the laughs are nonexistent, the music is dreadful, the acting is on the high school level, and the dance numbers are among the worst ever filmed.  Moreover, Rochester is the butt of several very crude racial jokes, including a comparison between his dancing and a jumping chimpanzee.  This film was made in 1939, that most magic of years in the movie industry.  One hopes that someone at Paramount had some shame.  Imagine a film that totally wastes the talents of Edward Arnold, Monty Woolley, and Betty Grable.  Even Dorothy Lamour looks bad.

Skip this one!",1162684800,3,642,4.72972972972973
