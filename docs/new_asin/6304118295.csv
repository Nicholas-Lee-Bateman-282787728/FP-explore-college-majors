7862439,3,6304118295,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1364428800,,170,3.8857142857142857
7862440,5,6304118295,Definitely a great addition to our collection..we have an extensive Martial Arts collection which our son loves..Very good purchase especially for the price!,1199923200,,157,5.869565217391305
7862441,2,6304118295,"Fearless Hyena is a fun, standard-issue early Jackie film, well worth seeing for any Kung Fu lover.  The fights are all humorous, including a lot of great propwork as well as a fight in drag.  The film isn't all that special, but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it, and it has some great moments.  Fearless Hyena II is an absolute dog, however, and I wouldn't recommend it even for free.  The storyline is so convoluted it is too confusing even to laugh AT, let alone laugh with.  Buy the first film if you like early Chan films, but don't bother with the second.",1065398400,,559,4.4411764705882355
7862442,3,6304118295,"for a earlier film of Jackie, Fearless hyena 1 is pretty good. Number 2 is very bad. You can tell they used a double of jackie and just took scrapes of number 1 and put it into number 2. So just get number 1!",958262400,,208,3.75
7862443,1,6304118295,"The good news is you get these two movies for the price of one; the bad news is the same. I enjoy Chan but this stuff is absolutely awful and of historical interest only, if that. If you've got nothing else to do you  have something better to do than to watch these.",948067200,,266,4.018867924528302
7862444,3,6304118295,I bought this box set about a year ago not knowing what these movies were about. When I popped them Into my VCR I had some traking problems. And the sound was weak. Anyways I got it working and enjoyed the movies. If you plan  to buy these movies beware of pic touble and low sound.,946684800,,282,4.035714285714286
7862445,3,6304118295,"I must agree with Jeff that Fearless Hyena Part I was excellent. The action and comedy are classic Jackie Chan. The sequel was also impossible for me to understand. The cast from Hyena part1 were in this one as well  but the characters switched rolls. Part 2 was very disapointing, part1 is a  must though for Jackie Chan fans.",944784000,2,327,4.52542372881356
