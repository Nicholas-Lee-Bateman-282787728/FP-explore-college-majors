3546695,2,B001E6V4EK,"It's very short,I expected more technical information, distribution of different instruments, why are they placed to the left or to the right,it's supposed to be a guide to the orchestra. Pity it has no subtitles, something one automatically expects. The most interesting thing: details on the actual making of some instruments.",1293667200,5,328,5.450980392156863
3546696,5,B001E6V4EK,"This production is an ""oldy but a goody""! I still like it because it doesn't use electronic music or animation like in new productions. Little children still prefer to see human faces. I just gave it to a one year old boy and he loves it and had no prior music exposure.
  It is a great piece of music, too.",1291939200,13,307,4.1
3546697,4,B001E6V4EK,It was purchased for my granddaughters 6 and 7 they seemed to enjoy it they play once in a while.,1266969600,,97,3.9
3546698,3,B001E6V4EK,found the subject matter to be intrestingly explanded but found the graffics to be of almost poor quality!!!!!,1266105600,,110,5.166666666666667
3546699,5,B001E6V4EK,"informative, entertaining, to the point.  my 3 and 4 year old grandsons hung on every word and wanted to watch it again!!  great gift idea!",1265241600,8,139,4.52
3546700,5,B001E6V4EK,This film is good for hearing and seeing the instruments piece by piece and all at once. I am studying composition and this is helping me hear the quality of each instrument and how they work in the orchestra. Also good music. some parts are cheesy but overall it is a good educational film on each part of the orchestra.,1249948800,13,321,4.366666666666666
8296919,5,B001E6V4EK,What a wonderful surprise.  There was so much on this dvd--more than just the piece of music.  Thank you!,1468022400,,105,4.473684210526316
8296920,5,B001E6V4EK,"This DVD fulfilled all of my expectations. It is well done and, after my review of it, served as a welcomed gift to two of my young grandchildren.",1454284800,,146,4.25
8296921,5,B001E6V4EK,"Although the clothes and eye glasses are slightly outdated, the rest of this DVD is pure gold. Wonderful music and really interesting explanations of the instruments.
The conductor leads viewers through a guided tour of the orchestral instruments. This is then followed by a full performance of Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"". My class of 50 music appreciation community college students will inevitably clap after the performance- they are that into it by the end.

I use this film to finish off the chapter on orchestra instruments. There really is no substitute to seeing the instruments while hearing the sounds and this DVD is the perfect way to do so until I can afford to bring an entire orchestra into class!!",1439769600,3,745,5.008064516129032
8296922,2,B001E6V4EK,"The original material for this DVD was from the '70's or '80's.  The presentation was dated, and I though about the heads of most young people, including the person for whom I purchased it.  I returned it and got a refund.",1427414400,,222,4.390243902439025
8296923,2,B001E6V4EK,"I am a music teacher.  Thought this would be great to show in a group setting.  It is not very engaging, drags, and is way too long to keep the attention of even older students.",1417824000,,177,4.0285714285714285
8296924,2,B001E6V4EK,old fashioned presentation and has little appeal for interactive kids of the 21st century and not a good buy for learning about the orchestra,1384646400,,141,4.916666666666667
8296925,5,B001E6V4EK,"Every child should have this.  It's a classic.  Buy it for your educational video collection.  Considering that schools are cutting arts budgets, you're going to have to expose your children at home to what they need to know.",1357948800,4,225,4.868421052631579
8296926,3,B001E6V4EK,"But I must say... a little boring. This video uses an extremely familiar piece to introduce standard orchestral instruments, but it is very dated (i.e. trendy, for the 80s) and the presentation style intellectual. A good study tool, not easy to enjoy.",1344556800,,251,5.0
8296927,5,B001E6V4EK,"It is exactly whait I expected and  enjoyed by every one  -  especialy the kids
At it's price it is a bargain for the young folks",1318377600,4,129,3.8846153846153846
8296928,3,B001E6V4EK,"The DVD has obviously been transcribed from video tape or even cine film and the video quality is poor.  Having said that the message given by the content of the DVD is excellent for people who love quality classical music but do not have a deep understanding of the way it is produced in the concert hall.  The more people can understand about the physical aspect of music production, the more they will get out of listening to the fine DVDs and recordings as well as the actual concert hall productions that are so easily available nowadays.  I show this film and similar fundamental educational DVDs (such as the Bernstein Lectures at Young Peoples Concerts)to my Classical Music Appreciation Course that I run for the University of the Third Age and it enhances their enjoyment of the music.
