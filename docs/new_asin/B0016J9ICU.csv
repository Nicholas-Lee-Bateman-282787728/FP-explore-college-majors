Island beauty Tollea (Maria Montez) is kidnapped on the eve of her wedding to Ramu (Jon Hall), and transported back to the island of her birth. Ramu and his sidekick Kado (Sabu) soon follow, where they discover a cult of cobra-worshippers, led by Tollea's twin sister Naja and corrupt High Priest Martok (Edgar Barrier).

DIRECTOR:

Robert Siodmak

CAST:

Edgar Barrier, Jon Hall (Ram), Sabu (Kado), Maria Montez (As: The Twin Sisters Tollea and Nadja)

COMMENTS:

Montez stars in a dual role as the rightful queen (Tollea) of a cobra-worshipping cult and her evil sister (Nadja) who tries to steal the throne. Hall and Sabu, who teamed with Montez on numerous occasions, are on hand to save the good queen.

Laughable jungle plot is given a highly stylized, colorful presentation by talented director Siodmak who created some of the best film noir of the 1940s and 1950s before returning to his native Germany where he continued to direct until his death in 1973.

This is the first role of Montez as a femme fatale. The movie exposes that the secret of her inexplicable impact to the public was the enormous conviction she was acting with, which supplied her lack of dramatic resources.

""Critics are writers. They like writing - and written characters. Maria Montez's appeal was on a puerly intuitive level. She was the bane of critics - that person whose effect cannot be known by words, described by words, flaunts words (her image spoke). Film critics are writers and they are hostile and uneasy in the resence of a visual phenomenon. They are most delighted by bare images that through visual bareness call thought into play to fill the visual gap. (...) A spectacular, flaming image - since it threatens their critic-hood need to be able to write - is bad and they attack it throwing in moral extensions and hinting at idiocy in whoever is capable of visually appreciating a visual medium"" (page 28-29). (From the book J. Hoberman curated with Jack Smith's writings).

This dual role, the writers Gene Lewis and Richard Brooks created for Maria in COBRA WOMAN will, would be repeated by the movie producers with big stars as: Bette Davis (A Stolen Life, Warner Bros 1946), Olivia Haviland (Dark Mirror, Universal 1946) and Bonita Granville (The Guilty, Monograma 1947)

The critic Bill Feret was the first one in consider this film as a classic in its genre. Rex Reed, another famous north-american critic, has mentioned constantly the name of Maria Montez to his readers due to his frequent comments of this movie.

Charles Ludlan made a parody of the movie and the famous writer Gore Vidal was inspired in this film and in SIREN OF ATLANTIS for writing MAYRA BREKINRIDGE and MYRON.",1344470400,,2455,4.8701923076923075

3157085,5,B0016J9ICU,"Universal has released the ultimate cult classic to DVD-R, Director Robert Siodmack's 'COBRA WOMAN'-1944, a film in which he completed along with two other gems 'SON OF DRACULA' and 'PHANTOM LADY' released all in the same year. Coming after the box office hit , Director John Rawlins 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' a few years before, fans have not one but two Maria Montez performances to relish and joins Jon Hall and Sabu to complete the party. Edgar Barrier chews the scenery as the villain as well as he did in 'ARABIAN NIGHTS'. Lon Chaney plays a mute role which he should have been used to by playing Kharis, the Mummy and also coming off his baby 'THE WOLF MAN' a few years before which was directed by this films Producer George Waggner but , alas, Chaney does not have much to do. The film is unclassifiable combining jungle( by including a Cheeta-type chimp in the proceedings), fantasy, and lost world genres and predates many Fifties Sci-Fi guilty pleasures 'CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON'- 1952 ,'QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE-1958',FIRE MAIDENS OF OUTER SPACE- 1959 and even Director George Pal's 'ATLANTIS, THE LOST CONTINENT'-1962. Yes, the sets and costumes are outlandish, the Cobra dance is campy, and Maria's accent is heavy but this film is a party classic of the first order.  Universal gets kudos by releasing a gorgeous transfer preserving the technicolor image, wait till you see Maria's shimmering dress and cobra headress on a High Definition screen.  This would be the last of Sabu's forays with Hall and Montez for shortly he would enlist as a war pilot during World War II fighting for our country.  So enjoy this wonderful movie at the end of Universal's glory before their future Producers and Screen writers churned out cheap imitations of this product till they merged as Universal-International.

3157090,5,B0016J9ICU,"Cobra Woman (1943) is Maria Montez's best picture because she plays
twin sisters, one good and one evil, and every one knows that two
Maria Montezes are better than one. Unfortunately, that means her acting
is twice as bad, but who cares? She's beautiful and a joy to watch -
like Carmen Miranda without the musical talent and the fruit.
Jon Hall, Sabu, Lon Chaney Jr., Edgar Barrier, Mary Nash and Lois Collier
are featured players.

On the day of her wedding, the good sister is kidnapped and returned to
Cobra Island (her birthplace) by the aging queen in order to confront
her evil sister to prevent her from continuing her sadistic ritual of
human sacricfices to the angry volcano god. The pagan King Cobra ritual
is high camp and a must-see.

Cobra Woman is everything a fan of Saturday Matinee flicks could hope for.
If you love the RKO Tarzan series, you will love this film, plus it has
the added benefit of glorious Technicolor. The print is beautiful...
sharp and clear and bright and the colors are perfect.

So far, Arabian Nights (1942) and Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves (1944)
have been released on dvd. Fans of Maria Montez are still waiting for
Sudan (1945), White Savage (1943) and Gypsy Wildcat (1944).

A movie like this is not a prime work for any restoration project and I was amazed at the great quality of this DVD. Consider it's age, the colors are sharp and bright and the sound amazingly good. As for the movie, it is a silly good sister/bad sister tale, the evil sister naturally ruling the home island of ""my people"" while the good sister whisked away at birth returns to rescue the island from her clutches. The scenes of the cobra dances are campy fun and all in all this is a movie that you just can't help but watch and enjoy. Escape gor an hour and eight minutes with ""Cobra Woman"".

Universal - U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:

Robert Siodmak

CAST:

Edgar Barrier, Jon Hall (Ram), Sabu (Kado), Maria Montez (As: The Twin Sisters Tollea and Nadja)

COMMENTS:

Montez stars in a dual role as the rightful queen (Tollea) of a cobra-worshipping cult and her evil sister (Nadja) who tries to steal the throne. Hall and Sabu, who teamed with Montez on numerous occasions, are on hand to save the good queen.

Laughable jungle plot is given a highly stylized, colorful presentation by talented director Siodmak who created some of the best film noir of the 1940s and 1950s before returning to his native Germany where he continued to direct until his death in 1973.

This is the first role of Montez as a femme fatale. The movie exposes that the secret of her inexplicable impact to the public was the enormous conviction she was acting with, which supplied her lack of dramatic resources.

""Critics are writers. They like writing - and written characters. Maria Montez's appeal was on a puerly intuitive level. She was the bane of critics - that person whose effect cannot be known by words, described by words, flaunts words (her image spoke). Film critics are writers and they are hostile and uneasy in the resence of a visual phenomenon. They are most delighted by bare images that through visual bareness call thought into play to fill the visual gap. (...) A spectacular, flaming image - since it threatens their critic-hood need to be able to write - is bad and they attack it throwing in moral extensions and hinting at idiocy in whoever is capable of visually appreciating a visual medium"" (page 28-29). (From the book J. Hoberman curated with Jack Smith's writings).

This dual role, the writers Gene Lewis and Richard Brooks created for Maria in COBRA WOMAN will, would be repeated by the movie producers with big stars as: Bette Davis (A Stolen Life, Warner Bros 1946), Olivia Haviland (Dark Mirror, Universal 1946) and Bonita Granville (The Guilty, Monograma 1947)

The critic Bill Feret was the first one in consider this film as a classic in its genre. Rex Reed, another famous north-american critic, has mentioned constantly the name of Maria Montez to his readers due to his frequent comments of this movie.

Charles Ludlan made a parody of the movie and the famous writer Gore Vidal was inspired in this film and in SIREN OF ATLANTIS for writing MAYRA BREKINRIDGE and MYRON.",1344470400,,2455,4.8701923076923075

3391582,5,B0016J9ICU,"Universal has released the ultimate cult classic to DVD-R, Director Robert Siodmack's 'COBRA WOMAN'-1944, a film in which he completed along with two other gems 'SON OF DRACULA' and 'PHANTOM LADY' released all in the same year. Coming after the box office hit , Director John Rawlins 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' a few years before, fans have not one but two Maria Montez performances to relish and joins Jon Hall and Sabu to complete the party. Edgar Barrier chews the scenery as the villain as well as he did in 'ARABIAN NIGHTS'. Lon Chaney plays a mute role which he should have been used to by playing Kharis, the Mummy and also coming off his baby 'THE WOLF MAN' a few years before which was directed by this films Producer George Waggner but , alas, Chaney does not have much to do. The film is unclassifiable combining jungle( by including a Cheeta-type chimp in the proceedings), fantasy, and lost world genres and predates many Fifties Sci-Fi guilty pleasures 'CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON'- 1952 ,'QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE-1958',FIRE MAIDENS OF OUTER SPACE- 1959 and even Director George Pal's 'ATLANTIS, THE LOST CONTINENT'-1962. Yes, the sets and costumes are outlandish, the Cobra dance is campy, and Maria's accent is heavy but this film is a party classic of the first order.  Universal gets kudos by releasing a gorgeous transfer preserving the technicolor image, wait till you see Maria's shimmering dress and cobra headress on a High Definition screen.  This would be the last of Sabu's forays with Hall and Montez for shortly he would enlist as a war pilot during World War II fighting for our country.  So enjoy this wonderful movie at the end of Universal's glory before their future Producers and Screen writers churned out cheap imitations of this product till they merged as Universal-International.

They looked great together, and made a few films. These Universal epics were great entertainment, back then. Wish they would release more of Maria Montez's films. These films are pure entertainment, and escapism...Beautiful technicolor...and lavish setttings...I recommend this film.",1321142400,,429,5.417910447761194
3391587,5,B0016J9ICU,"Cobra Woman (1943) is Maria Montez's best picture because she plays
twin sisters, one good and one evil, and every one knows that two
Maria Montezes are better than one. Unfortunately, that means her acting
is twice as bad, but who cares? She's beautiful and a joy to watch -
like Carmen Miranda without the musical talent and the fruit.
Jon Hall, Sabu, Lon Chaney Jr., Edgar Barrier, Mary Nash and Lois Collier
are featured players.

On the day of her wedding, the good sister is kidnapped and returned to
Cobra Island (her birthplace) by the aging queen in order to confront
her evil sister to prevent her from continuing her sadistic ritual of
human sacricfices to the angry volcano god. The pagan King Cobra ritual
is high camp and a must-see.

Cobra Woman is everything a fan of Saturday Matinee flicks could hope for.
If you love the RKO Tarzan series, you will love this film, plus it has
the added benefit of glorious Technicolor. The print is beautiful...
sharp and clear and bright and the colors are perfect.

So far, Arabian Nights (1942) and Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves (1944)
have been released on dvd. Fans of Maria Montez are still waiting for
Sudan (1945), White Savage (1943) and Gypsy Wildcat (1944).
I would also like to see the release of Bowery To Broadway (1944) where
Maria has the distinction of having both her singing and dancing dubbed!",1314576000,11,1367,4.66390041493776

8262670,5,B0016J9ICU,"[This review is of the Spanish Blu-ray disc] No need to go into any more detail about what a great camp classic this film is, other than to say that anyone who has never seen Maria Montezs Cobra Dance is missing something in life. Even though Amazon reviewers are pretty unanimous that the video and audio of the regular DVD release are outstanding, I took a chance on the imported Blu-rayand was not disappointed. Other reviewers say the film never had a professional restoration, but the results here are so breathtaking that its hard to believe its simply a matter of using a very a good print of the film. Every leaf of the vegetation, every scale on King Cobra himself, every bead and sequin of Ms. Montezs fantasy costumes, every one of her eye lashes is clearly visible in brilliantly saturated Technicolor. The level of detail is every bit as good as the Blu-ray restorations of Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz; like those, this one almost crosses into the realm of being TOO good, in which the clarity of detail at times can be distracting. The only visual flaw I could detect was a small persistent green dot in the lower left-hand quarter of the screen in one of the early scenes, but overall the print is virtually perfect. The Blu-ray is considerably more expensive than the standard DVD, but don't let that put you off; as one wise Amazon reviewer said of the imported Blu-ray of The Egyptian, just pretend you're buying an expensive Criterion Collection release, because not even Criterion could produce a better-looking reproduction than this.",1502582400,,1567,4.7226277372262775
