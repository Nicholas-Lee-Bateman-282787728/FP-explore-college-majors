1713862,5,B000067DFC,"A French movie that never made it to our shores is one of the more entertaining film experiences of the last few years for me. A thriller and mystery, exotic, well-paced, wonderfully acted, weird, and with great cinematography, this film by the same crew that did ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" deserves watching by a much bigger audience. I highly recommend this as a nice change of pace for folks tired of Hollywood baloney.",1127174400,,421,4.780821917808219
1713863,4,B000067DFC,"I won't go into the story of the film, others have done a fine job on that.

Comments on the DVD: received it from iNetVideo via Amazon. It took almost two weeks to arrive as it was shipped from Canada and most likely got stuck in Customs. DVD arrived in excellent condition.

The film is in French, subtitles available in the film, but not on the extra material, which is unfortunate as my French is attrocious.

Now for the ""All Digital"" part. I bought this mostly to see what all digital feels like. If you do it for that reason, be prepared to spend the first third of the film asking yourself: ""All righty then, was that a set or was that an effect?"" At first I was disappointed, as the film looked as though it was shot on video tape not on film. As time went on, I got used to the new format and some of the scenes were magnificent. The story line was good as well, so overall, I recommend it for film buffs and casual movie watchers.",1100995200,,941,4.1878453038674035
1713864,5,B000067DFC,"Pitof, the one named director of Vidocq, has recently come unto infamy by being the director of Catwoman.  This is a shame, because Vidocq is like nothing you have ever seen, whereas I am sure Catwoman will be the opposite.  Regardless of his recent films, Pitof has been responsible for the visual effects of the Jeunet and Caro films ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Alien 4"" (although again, like Catwoman, in 'Alien 4' these were French craftsman trying to translate to an American audience).  I think I would not be in the minority if I were to say that the visual effects of those films (even Alien 4) were incredible, and revolutionary.

What Vidocq is, is nothing short of a mark for cinemaphiles.  It is the first all-digitally produced film.  It is a great gothic tapestry woven over an hour and a half that ends in a great showdown...  But overall, it is an example of a film that was created outside of Hollywood, and using more European conventions to tell the story.  It was very enjoyable to watch this film, because the story was not immediately obvious.

The visuals are INCREDIBLE!  The sequence in the field with the lightning (you will know when you see it) is magnificent.  I think that this is a template for what can (and will) be done in the future of digital filmmaking.  I highly recommend this film.",1094860800,21,1341,4.635593220338983
1713865,4,B000067DFC,"Set in 1830, French action film 'Vidocq' features Gerard Depardieu as Vidocq, convict-turned-police officer who must investigate the spooky cases of murders, in which lightning from the sky is used as the killing method.  Oh, and remember, 'Vidocq' is based on the real-life French of the same name.  Vidocq, himself an ex-convict, changed sides and later was appointed chief of the police, then became a private detective.

Vidocq once inspired Douglas Sirk film 'Scandal in Paris' back in the 1940s, but now in this film must confront the mystrious suspect 'The Alchemist' whose face is covered with a mirror-like mask, and who can fight like a kung-hu master, and vanish like a ghost.  He is the mastermind of the bizzarre murders, and Vidocq must capture this superhuman creature.

Absurd?  Sure, very much absurd, but it doesn't end here.  You will also see Guillaume Canet ('The Beach') as the young writer who also seek for the truths about the disappearance of the detective (yes, Vidocq disappears), and Ines Sastre as an exotic dancer who must hold the key to the mystery.  Yes, as the summery of plot shows, the film should be called cartoonish and often self-indlugent.  However, 'Vidocq' is interesting at several points.  So I write facts about it, then my impressions.

[DIRECTOR]  I don't know how you will respond, but the (first-time) director of the film is Pitof (real name Jean-Christophe Comar), who was responsible for visual effects for 'Alien 4' and others.  But wait, Pitof?  Yes, that's him, the guy behind the ill-fated Halle Berry film 'Catwoman.'  Oh, don't run and click away, for 'Vidoq' is not as bad as you may think.

The film has impressive visual effects, as you may easily expect from his CV, and it deserves some mention.  The film is showy and flashy, but often beautiful just like the 19th century paintings with Gothic touch.  But more attractive is its production design that re-creates the murky world of Paris underworld where another revolution is coming near.  The production designer Jean Rabasse did a fantastic work, as he did in Oscar-nominated 'Vatel.'  Also, Marc Caro did the characrer designs.

The film is all shot with digital camera, so the images, visually stunnig as they are, might be too much for your eyes.  Actually, 'Vidocq' is the first film that used Sony HDW-F900 camera, which was also used in George Lucas' ""Episode 2.'

[THE STORY]  Good, but not great.  Not that it is bad (the screenwriter is Jean-Christohre Grange, original writer of French thriller 'Crimson Rivers').  But the film shows too frequent flashbacks, and I am afaind that he gave the story too many things, which should be more simple.

So, should we see the film?  If you like the visuals, yes.  Comic book action, yes.  But if you want some insightful version of this historical figure, you should read the book.  But Vidocq's own 'Memoirs' are highly colorful (and fictionalized, it is said) accounts of his activities, so why not this one?",1091664000,3,2981,4.92570281124498
1713866,3,B000067DFC,"The story takes place in summer of 1830 in the French capital, Paris. Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu), a former convicted criminal, has turned his back on crime and become a vigilant detective for hire as he is investigating a bizarre murder where someone used lightening to kill two victims. However, Vidocq is not so fortunate as he is murdered by a strange killer in the beginning shortly after he has seen his face, which is hidden behind a mirrored mask. A young journalist has been asked by Vidocq to write his memories, and now when he is dead the journalist wants to find the killer of Vidocq.

  Vidocq is shot with a short wide angled lens, which distorts distances and the images within each frame. Most scenes contain vibrant colors that feel out of place and are combined with peculiar zooms and camera angles that coerce the audience into a visual bizarre matrix. There is also wide use of computer generated images which makes the whole thing look nightmarish. The lens, colors, cinematography, and the CGI enhance the bizarre story, which is well-written. As the film snowballs it becomes more complex as it leads toward the true identity of the killer, which in the end offers a pretty good cinematic experience as the many elements of film making break new ground for cinema.",1090886400,11,1287,4.788288288288288
1713867,4,B000067DFC,"This movie, Vidocq, is a french action movie with a detective investigation style plot.  I bought it because it was connected to Brotherhood of the Wolf through links on the amazon.ca site, and I'm glad I did because this is a very thrilling and amazing movie.
Being the first film shot entirely digitally (ahead of SW: Attack of the Clones) it is the forerunner for great movies yet to come.  The look is very clean and showy, but has a dark and gritty feel because of what is going on in the story.
I loved the music however I don't remember it using the 5.1 surround to the full extent it could.  Maybe I should just re-watch it during the fight sequences.  Even though I say that, it does have excellent sound, and has english subtitles if you cannot understand spoken french.  The subtitles are easy to follow without taking too much attention away from the details of the video.
The story is terrific!  It's a very fast paced investigation of three men and their despicable acts and their subsequent murders by the ultimately evil character, The Alchemist.
If you like visually exciting movies with great stories, definatly find some way to see this movie.  I haven't been impressed by a movie this much for at least half a year, and I see lots of movies.  The story works out in the end and is not confusing or open ended (though it has a little weird thing in the last few seconds), and it left me with the feeling that I had just seen a top quality mystery movie.
As said, I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes movies that are full of visual goodness, heh that is to say special effects, but also have a great intelligent story and fast-paced action.  I spent 36 bucks (CAD) to see this and I'm glad I did.",1044403200,,1721,4.420886075949367
1713868,5,B000067DFC,"VIDOQ defies words. Words could not do this movie justice. I watched it and was speachless. I had to watch it again just to understand the mystery better. The movie is like watching a dream and a nightmare on speed. The movie is a cross between the Matrix, Moulin Rouge and From Hell. It is basically an investigation of an investigation into a serial killer. This killer is unlike anything you have ever seen, the assasin has been stalking Paris for Centuries and the movie is set in 1830 just before the Revolution for the Charter of Human Rights. The movie is visually stunning and very freaky. Everything in the movie is a clue to the mystery, yet the mystery haunts you, because as you watch it, the reality you understand becomes irrelevant. This is the best movie I have ever watched and even the subtitles didn't bother me... they added to something that was mysterious and visually unique.",1032739200,4,898,4.654088050314465

1713908,4,B000067DFC,"This is a ridiculously fun movie. It's not for everyone, though.

The cinematography (or, I suppose I should say, videography) makes it look like a TV show, not a film, and that may be off-putting to many. When it's good, though, the visual effects are outstanding.

If you're watching the English dubbed version, the lip-synch is great but the delivery is underwhelming.

Subtitles tend to distract from on-screen action, though, so you need to pick your poison: the original actors' voices and performances beat the dubbed voice actors, hands down, but unless you speak French subtitles can distract from the action. I  prefer the subtitles, which is how I originally saw this film, but since (currently) the dubbed version is the only one on Prime, I discovered I appreciate the technical aspects of the voice acting, even though the performances of the voice actors falls a little flat.

Overall, with either version, it's kind of a guilty pleasure: a quick-cut period-piece action movie with just enough steam-punk fantasy elements to satisfy nerds like me who are into weird stuff like that. The aesthetics of Vidocq ended up informing other movies' styles, like Sherlock, as well as Hellboy and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (the movies, not the graphic novels). If you thought those were fun movies, you'd probably get a kick out of this  one.",1416355200,,1359,5.017777777777778

1713923,4,B000067DFC,"I haven't seen too many French films but I though this detective movie plot moved very well from beginning till the end.

For crying out loud, has this director never heard of a freaking Steady-Cam?! Cutting rapidly from angle to angle, extreme close-ups, high contrast lighting that you can only catch quick glimpses of the action due to all of the blackness on the screen, etc....

What a horrible cinematic experience. No matter how good the script or the acting is, if one must work to puzzle out the images on the screen, it takes all of the fun out of watching the movie.

It is not esthetically as beautiful as Asian martial arts or Hollywood main-stream form of personal fighting we have become accustomed. It is weakly dubbed in English which might be better than reading subtitles for this particular fast-pace movie.
Pros: visually striking and more importantly very different from most Asian/Americal movies in both photography and story-telling and plot-development. Nicely and meticulously directed. Recommended if you want something light but entertaining. I can compare it with the recent Sherlock Holmes movies; just this one is in a bit smaller scale and cost.",1398297600,,647,5.545454545454546
1713927,1,B000067DFC,This sounded interesting and having Depardieu suggested it would be worth watching.

Gripping from the very first scene, it concerns the story of a Jack the Ripper type character menacing 19th century Paris.  And nearly everything about the movie exihibts perfection: from the subtlety of plot, to the acting, to camera work.  Gerard Depardieu stars as the heroic, but somewhat mysterious, detective - a former criminal himself, turning now to fight crime, and some of the forces he formerly identified with.  For lovers of modern movie making, to lovers of noir suspense drama, this movie is clearly a no miss, but be forewarned: it is certainly not for children, and probably not for ladies either.

First of all, it's part horror, part martial art and all bad.  This is not a film about Vidocq....this is a film about the director.

Hey look at me! Let me put the camera on the floor showing someone walking into a room.  Now let me put it on the ceiling showing them coming in.  Next, let me pan in and out and all around as they sit at a desk. Now, let me go in for a close up of their face at an angle, etc, etc. The direction is so annoying and in your face that you have trouble following the story which is disjointed as well.

Don't get me wrong.  I've seen plenty of stylized directors and many were quite good without without being distracting, but not this one.  There was literally not one minute where the camera stayed stationary.  The fight scenes were choreographed Chinese acrobatics with choppy close up editing.  You know, the kind where the director has no idea of how to stage a good battle.  Instead, he opts for tight handheld movements of waists and torsos moving around.

Vidocq seems to have been quite the character and I knew I wouldn't get the real story from a movie about him, but this was a travesty.  I found a good book on his life and will be ordering that instead.",1328140800,,1365,4.256809338521401
1713964,3,B000067DFC,"This is a genuinely interesting effort, but it falls apart for me as soon as the secret of the killer is revealed.  Frankly, I was vastly more interested in the real story of Vidocq and the history the movie keeps alluding to than in what the main plot serves up.  And the cinematography people keep gushing over is bad video game cutscene quality, with a lot of obvious CGI, quick cuts, and extreme close-ups of people's noses.  Gerard Depardieu and the rest of the cast are good here; I just think they get lost a bit under the director's ham-fisted attempts at stylishness and horror.

** Spoiler **

My main objection to this movie is that at some point they give up on the detective genre and just say, ""Screw it!  He's magic.""  It's like the 2009 ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes"" low-budget cash-in where Sherlock Holmes fights CGI dinosaurs for some reason.  The actual Vidocq was a really interesting guy living at a really interesting time, and 3/4 of this movie takes advantage of that.  Then the last quarter kind of undoes all that by abandoning any rules of reason or physics and making the villain an immortal Matrix-ninja who eats people's souls and can't stand mirrors.  Weird.",1311465600,2,1203,4.685714285714286
1713965,5,B000067DFC,"Original, Beautiful, Brutal, and Honest movie. I have never seen anything like this before. This is what the recent Hollywood Sherlock Holmes movie should have been like.

Either way the visual effect is very original and excellent. Even the action scenes are intense, brutal and well choreographed without having that pointless plastic action figure fake feel that many modern choreographed fight scenes have (see any of the Star Wars prequels)
If you are tired of the regular run of the mill Hollywood special effects before story before acting then you must see this. This movie is proof that you can have it all and produce a 5 star movie!
Everything doesn't have to be Branded, Polished, Politically Correct and Dumb Down for the audience like Hollywood does in every sci-fi horror flicks these days. This movie spits in your face and slits your throat and you will love it for doing that because it respects you as an audience.
Ten years later and Vidocq seems so fresh and original while current top Hollywood blockbuster movies like Avatar and Tron 2 are long forgotten about and outdated before they leave theaters.",1295654400,,1314,4.767543859649122
1713966,5,B000067DFC,"""Dark Portals: The Chronicles of Vidocq"" is the best film I've seen in 2011.  Sure, I'm writing this on January 4th, but still - what a COOL film.

Gerard Depardieu owns the screen as Vidocq, a hard-boiled detective in a story set in 1830s France, though there is enough steampunk going on to make you wonder if the historical timeline is bending, if not breaking. The movie starts with Vidocq's death, and it is told as an investigation by a nosy journalist/biographer, who plans to solve the mystery of Vidocq's death as the last chapter in the biography.  So, there are a lot of flashbacks, but it all works.  As the film moves along, you start to realize all is not as it seems, and there are enough false trails to keep you guessing.

Action-packed?  Check!  Creepy and grim atmosphere?  Check!  Historical outfits?  Check?  Brief nudity?  Check and check! And best of all, a creature/madman that is just dazzling, and a real departure from the ""predictable creep of the week"" that seems to show up too often on the Syfy channel.

Watch this film in French with English subtitles (if you need them).  The original language adds a lot to the atmosphere.  I would love to see more in the Dark Portals series, and I definitely want more of Vidocq!  This is Depardieu's best role in years, he should seize the opportunity.",1294012800,,1323,4.637931034482759

I am not afraid to say that this is the best action movie I've seen in the past decade! If you like visuals, this movie has it, if you enjoy a twisted storyline that keeps you wonder every turn of the way, its there.

As his partner mourns (over a bottle) a young journalist shows up wanting to finish writing Vidocq's biography and find his killer. Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Sometimes there are flashbacks during the flashbacks, but it seems to work. Prior to his death Vidocq had the killer remove his mask so he could see his face. Vidocq's body is not recovered. The ending is not going to be too hard to figure out. I loved the backgrounds in this movie. They were a bit surreal, but not as cartoonish as Dick Tracy. The movie went at a good pace. My biggest problem was the extremely poor dubbing, especially the minor characters who had the same voice. This guy dubs bad Italian movies too. The movie contains a look into opium dens and the red light district. Minor nudity.",1281398400,2,861,4.561290322580645

I love the graphics in this movie - some special techniques (don't remember the name of it) were used for the first time in this movie and have been used by many ever since. Plot line is unexpected, interesting, intriguing. And as usually Gerard Depardieu is great.",1262131200,,454,4.481927710843373
1713990,4,B000067DFC,"Marc Caro splits off from his long time collaborator, Jean-Pierre Jeunet to offer up this wild ride of a film. Set in 17th century Paris, during a time of political upheaval, the viewer follows the investigation of a supposed biographer of the title character Vidocq to find out how he died and who killed him. The path of the investigation is long and twisted, involving more than a few characters and odd locations, and ends in a pretty cool climax.

This film is visually stunning as one would expect given its pedigree. The street scenes  of Paris are like nothing I've ever seen before in film. The colors are over-saturated and the camera angles and movements are often dizzying. There was a certain harsh edge to the images that threw me a bit, but not enough to stop me from enjoying the lush visual palette.

This is a very good film but it has a couple of significant flaws that kept me from giving it the full five. First are the characters. Except for one female character, I found these folks to be a wholly unlikeable bunch. Even Vidocq's partner, though colorful, had an abrasive edge to him. They rather remind us Americans why we don't care for the French. The other is the script itself. The story outline is fine but the investigation just isn't clever enough. Vidocq's biographer goes to a given character to get information, gets it, then goes on to the next and so on and so on. The only real surprise comes in the final few minutes. It also could have used more whimsy. As dark as ""City of Lost Children"" might have been, it was also a very funny movie. Dark Portals could have used some of that fun.

That being said, it should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. The pluses far outweigh the negatives. If you like Caro's earlier works or the works of Terry Gilliam and those of similar ilk, this is a must see.",1261785600,,1840,4.483582089552239
1713991,3,B000067DFC,"After French detective Vidocq (one of the historical figures whom Sherlock Holmes was based on, played here by Gerard Depardieu) is killed at the hands of the Alchemist, a killer who wears a mirrored mask and steals the souls of his victims, his young biographer Etienne (Guillaume Canet) decides to solve his murder as a final tribute to this great man. The story is told partially in flashbacks, with both Etienne and Vidocq (in the flashbacks) solving the same mystery ""together"".

""Dark Portals"" is a stylish yet strange movie that may not appeal to all tastes. The film is directed by Pitof, a visual effects expert who graduated to directing, so the special effects in this film are incredible, as is the scenery, which appears to have been added by computer. The plot of this film is unusual - I don't want to say too much about it, so as not to give away too many of the plot twists, but the story combines mystery and horror/fantasy elements and as a result it can be viewed as either a mystery or as a horror film. I, personally, am not a fantasy fan, so didn't really like the fantasy elements all that much, but I am a big mystery fan and that was enough to keep me interested. The script of this film was co-written by Jean-Christophe Grange, who also wrote ""The Crimson Rivers"" and ""The Empire of the Wolves"", two of my favourite mystery novels, and although this is nowhere near as good as either of those books, and although it is a bit slow moving at times, it is still a decent story.

One thing that does let this film down is the acting, which felt amateurish to me. Even Depardieu, who had made over 100 movies prior to this one, seems wooden, and the less experienced actors are even worse. I suspect that this is the down side of having a technical expert as a director.

Overall, this is an above-average, but not great, film that is worth watching if you are looking for something different, but won't stay with you for long after the credits have finished rolling.",1223424000,2,1990,4.5069252077562325

1713993,4,B000067DFC,"One of the pluses of the huge explosion of video stores is the sudden availability of foreign films.  Many have great storylines and good dialogue, but with poor special effects, lackluster soundtracks and plain cinematography that comes with low budgets, they often compare poorly with Hollywood productions, especially in the category of science fiction, fantasy and action movies.  But the 21st century has brought cheap computers and global outsourcing to the rescue, and now many foreign movies are just as good as those from Hollywood.  This is one of them.  This French production hit US video stores earlier this year and is very well done.  At its surface, this is a crime mystery, but the mystery itself is built on elements of fantasy and science fiction.  Being a French production and starring an all French-cast; sexual themes are part of the story, though there is never a scene of sexual contact or nudity in the entire movie.  The visual imagery is dark and sepia-toned, reminding the careful viewer of 300 or other CGI-heavy movies.  The special effects are great and very realistic, and the dialogue is good, even if one has to read English subtitles.  The movie is rated R for many good reasons, and I would not recommend kids to watch it, even with their parents.  But overall, a great flick.",1191196800,2,1313,4.873873873873874

The setting is Paris in 1830 and a young journalist is trying to shed light on the death of a private investigator that has died in his efforts to find and capture a mysterious murderer who's been using unprecedented sophistication and imagination in killing his victims.

The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, the murder mystery, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the background events leading to a major insurrection.

The movie portrays superbly life (which is quite miserable) in Paris in 1830, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.

We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's political situation (Royalists vs. Republicans vs. Napoleonists as well as Franco-Prussian relations).

Gerard Depardieu, Ines Sastre (who is GORGEOUS!), Guillome Canet, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!

The setting, the dialogues, the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!

Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.

In short, Vidocq is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!

Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) for those with a soft spot for France and French History.",1177718400,9,1961,5.337662337662338

1714000,3,B000067DFC,"Dark Portals: The Chronicles of Vidocq (Pitof, 2001)

Pitof lined up some serious talent for his directorial debut. Marc Caro, with whom Pitof had previously worked on City of Lost Children, was lurking about backstage. Gerard Depardieu was lurking around frontstage. For the script, Pitof loosely adapted the memoirs of the world's first modern private eye (which are, according to all accounts, pretty loose adaptations of his life anyway). How can you go wrong? Well, simply put, you can't.

Depardieu plays Francois-Eugene Vidocq, the murderer who became the controversial head of the Parisian police force before retiring to open his own detective business with his longtime friend Nimier (Moussa Maskri, recently of Two Brothers). As the movie opens, however, we find Vidocq plunging to a fiery death in a smelter at the hands of a man whose face is masked with a mirror. Nimier, of course, is out to avenge Vidocq's death by finding the killer; so, too, is Etienne Boisset (L'Enfer's Guillaume Canet), Vidocq's biographer (based, perhaps on Balzac, who's suspected of ghost-writing Vidocq's memoirs). Nimier and Boisset are both in their own races to find Vidocq's killer, while the police are also on the hunt (and do not look favorably on the other two barging in and mucking things up). In order to find the killer, however, all parties involved have to figure out everything Vidocq had discovered about his last case, and thus retrace his steps.

I say this movie isn't for everyone because it doesn't have a very mainstream Hollywood blockbuster feel, it has a very foreign essence to it. I venture to say if you liked Brotherhood Of The Wolf then you will probably like this one to. The mood at atmosphere of the film are brilliantly captured and every scene would make a wonderful still photograph. Be prepared to sit down and watch it without distractions, if you miss even a few minutes you might become confused. There are a lot of subtle flashbacks throughout the movie which may prove confusing if you're not paying attention.

Not only will the plot twists and turns of Vidocq keep you guessing up to the end of the movie; the atmosphere will intoxicate you.

1714007,5,B000067DFC,"The most intriguing part about this amazing French historical thriller is that it was totally ignored by American and British  box office. Whether it became yet another victim of Anglo-French eternal Kulturkampf, or just a mere blunder on behalf of either French or American/British producers, it is still not an excuse not to show such a spectacular movie to the English speaking audience. We can only thank Canadian bilinguality that made producers in the French part of the country put the English subtitles into the film so those of us who don't speak French could also enjoy this masterpiece from a French visuals wizard Pitof. The story is set in Paris in the turbulent days of the July Revolution of 1830 and based on a struggle between a famous French detective of the early 19 century Eugene Vidocq, played by Girard Depardieu, and the most powerful and dangerous, preying for some reason mostly on young virgins, mysterious serial killer known as Alchemist. Their fight in the beginning of the movie ends up with Vidocq's death and the story is narrated by a young journalist who is determined to find this villain and avenge the slain detective. He follows the footsteps of Vidocq's investigation in the head-spinning rollercoaster ride through aristocratic salons with the most unaristocratic habits, the Parisian underbelly and its ill-famous quarter du Temple where you can buy anything or more precisely anyone, the opium dens and the dens of Revolution, seeing and finding out things along the way that noone was able to see and know, untill he (and everybody else) comes to the dramatic and surprising final which will definitly knock your socks off. The whole movie, colorful like you can only imagine, is so beatifully crafted (like, for example, breathtaking unforgettable image of an aerial view of Paris of early 1800s) so in the end it leaves you absolutely stunned. Real eyecandy. Enjoy it.",1127606400,5,1914,5.018867924528302

7962571,5,B000067DFC,"There's seem to be quite a few lukewarm and negative reviews of this out there.  It's quite surprising as to me the film was quite obscure, and I can't imagine that many people stumbling into it unless it was their thing.

In any case, the appealing features of this film are in its very unique and inventive visual ideas.  They really used the film medium to its full extent to tell a story, to a much greater extent than most movies do.  There is much in this film which you cannot properly process verbally.  It is in the language of the image which speaks directly to other parts of your brain.  I thought it was magnificent and intriguing, I watched it twice in the first 24 hours I encountered it and plan to revisit it again in the future.  A many-layered confection of intrigue and darkness.",1484006400,,799,4.431506849315069

7962574,2,B000067DFC,"I'm pretty open minded to something out of the ordinary, and in fact rarely watch a movie multiple times. I watched this whole movie, and it just wasn't that great to me: not the directing, not the pacing, and definitely not the plot. It took a long time to get to the one main plot twist,at the end, and I thought, well, no surprise, and I really don't care about any of these characters.",1465084800,,389,4.27027027027027

7962578,4,B000067DFC,This overlooked horror film is a feast for the eyes although at times the English dubbing threatens to break the spell of willing disbelief. The plot is twisty and complex. It will keep even top armchair detectectives guessing as they follow the tale on the heels of an intrepid reporter or is it the role model for Sherlock Holmes we're tailing through the chaotic streets of an Alternate Universe Paris on the brink of Revolution. A must see for steampunk and paranormal mystery/horror fans.,1459036800,,493,4.880952380952381
