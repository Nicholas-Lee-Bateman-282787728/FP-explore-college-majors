5714897,4,B00CCNLS9U,"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this one but you need to know that this is not the action dvd which the cover leads you to believe. But this is a drama with an excellent storyline and some very decent actors to pull it off. There is a similarity to this film and what just happened to Sony. The difference is that here Sony is the police Dept. and every officer on the force is on the clock. Not just because their computer system has been hacked but 5 officers have been kidnapped at the same time and the clock is ticking. There is suspense, drama and just enough action to keep you interested.",1420329600,2,599,4.2631578947368425
5714898,4,B00CCNLS9U,loved it was good action flick and kept me interested - love aaron kwok and tony lau - they left enough story for another movie,1396396800,,127,4.12
5714899,4,B00CCNLS9U,"A 2012 Hong Kong film Cold War (Hon Jin) has nothing to do with the tense post-WW2 relationship between USA and USSR. Written and directed by Lok Man Leung and Kim-ching Luk (their feature debut), this is a police thriller set in modern-day Hong Kong, the safest city in Asia, where five Emergency Unit police officers are abducted on the same day as a bomb attack in Mongkok.

As Commissioner of Police is away in Europe, Deputy Commissioner Waise Lee (Tony Leung Ka Fai) takes charge of this difficult case, but another Deputy Commissioner Sean Lau (Aaron Kwok) does not like Lees aggressive way of investigation. What makes the case even more complicated is that one of the kidnapped officers is Lees son Joe (Eddie Peng). And there could be a mole within the police.

Some part of the film may remind us of Infernal Affairs (of which star Andy Lau appears as a cameo in Cold War), but Cold War unfolds much faster than the 2002 hit. Maybe its too fast for some viewers, as Cold War has so many twists and turns. There are a few respectable action scenes, among which the highway shootout is the highlight (filmed on a highway, a set that was made for this film), but the films strength lies in the rivalry between two Deputy Commissioners.

Slick and well-acted Cold War keeps us guessing what's coming next. Though it lacks the depth of Infernal Affairs, Cold War is an entertaining police thriller.",1386288000,2,1404,4.6305220883534135
5714900,4,B00CCNLS9U,"Being a native Cantonese, I personally like this movie. I saw Hong Kong movie all the time along my growing up. It's kind of a traditional Hong Kong police drama but still attractive to me.

I know the English translation is not good enough for English speaking audiences, no wonder some people found this movie boring or confusing. The Cantonese language is unique and quite different from Chinese Mandarin. No matter how to translate it, even into Mandarin, some of the meanings are just gone.

Trust me, if you're a Cantonese or know Cantonese well, you will enjoy this film.",1385769600,6,578,4.77
5714901,2,B00CCNLS9U,"The film is also called ""Laan jin."" It has nothing to do with the cold war, nor is it much of an action thriller. The film is a Hong Kong police drama which utilizes a kidnapping and bombing as background for a police commissioner struggle. There are long dramatic scenes of internal office conflict and politics which follow a very orderly process.

The translation is not herky-jerky, but very straight slang English, no reverse syntax. Some of the dubbing made the actors look bad, especially the woman crying for her dead husband. The film focuses on Deputy Police Commissioner Sean Lau (Aaron Kwok) and his relationship with the commissioner (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and operation Cold War. Cold War is a police emergency that happens when an emergency van with five hostages are stolen and a bomb goes off at a cinema. While part of the story involves solving the crime, a good two thirds of the film is a complex multi-sided office drama.

The film uses a stock made for TV sound track. It has some cliche tough guy language like ""Desperate times call for desperate measures"" and ""I was never here."" It then ruins it with ""I prefer latte."" There is also some mention of police and government openness, something I didn't know if it was a criticism of government or a government propaganda statement. The film lost me for a moment when the internal office conflict started as I was expecting a Chinese Dirty Harry. Instead I got a Joe Friday arguing with his boss and then apologizing. Clearly the Chinese don't have the genre down for American audiences.

Parental Guide: Some minor F-bomb usage. No sex or nudity. Woman in lacy top and panties.",1380931200,5,1647,4.711805555555555
5714912,5,B00CCNLS9U,"I thought this movie was quite entertaining.  The action and drama/suspense were well balanced and well-developed, and the plot twists and turns--while sometimes a bit challenging to decipher--were all consistent with the individuals' characters (vs in American movies where plot twists often rely upon characters doing things that are entirely out of character).  The movie even predicts and helps to narrate your own experience--as Lee says during his interrogation, one emerges from just being in the action, to actually figuring out what the boundaries are and how things work. in the same way, as the movie unfolded, the plot became clearer.

What was especially interesting were all the Hong Kong aspects of the movie.  These ranged from the very strong messages about the strength of rule of common law (a British legacy); pride in being the ""safest city in the world""; the most well-tailored actors ever assembled in one film; and a bit of tweaking of the unmannerly Chinese press. Also, enough fireworks (of all sorts) and gore to satisfy the adolescent in all of us.",1490313600,2,1076,5.096590909090909

5714935,2,B00CCNLS9U,"This movie is very slow with lots of talking and arguments with little action.  It's a Hong Kong film done in Cantonese with English subtitle, which is good, but the movie was very confusing throughout the movie until the end.  Basically, fiver officers disappear off the radar.  The Police Commissioner is retiring and is out of the city.  The Deputy Commissioners (two of them) and vying for the soon to be open position.  One of them doesn't think highly of the other and he has a son in the police force, who turns out to be one of the five who disappeared.  It turns out the five officers were kidnapped and the kidnappers want a ransom from the city that is a huge sum (multi-million dollars).  The kidnapping was done in a way that everyone suspects its an inside job, so someone in the police force is a mole.  They all get suspicious of each other and blames each other for every mistake until finally, the two Deputy Directors begin to show respect for one another and appreciates each other's abilities.  In the end, they figured out who the mole was, but everyone is a suspect.  Other than the very few action scenes, the rest of the movie is super boring, and confusing at first.",1486598400,4,1192,4.502325581395349

After receiving several cryptic phone calls from the hijackers, one officer starts realizing they're aware of every crucial decision they make. Now that is the description that was given (more or less) on the cover now for mine....although this was a very talented group of actors in a very ambitious movie, I felt confused and lost a lot of the time. There are a great many characters and a great many titles in the Hong Kong Police department. I did have a rough time with all the titles and who worked for whom. In my opinion, it was a very long way to go for the ending that it had. I love my Chinese movies so I was a bit stoked going in and I think I was a bit let down.

8580306,3,B00CCNLS9U,"I enjoyed this movie. There are a couple of moments that drag, but overall very interesting. It has both action, thriller, mystery and a bunch of twist and turns. I didn't know who to trust til the end. I want to provide some details of the movie, but I don't know how to do so, without spoiling it. I was lucky enough to see the sequel (has Chow Yun-Fat), where it goes into further understanding of the actions of the first movie. I have to give the movie three stars only because I saw the sequel and I would give it four stars. I would like to be able to give it 3.5, but of course no can do.

Cold War is more of a drama mystery than an action film. Throughout the movie I had a nagging feeling that something was missing. I'm not entirely sure what the problem was, but it had the feel of a made-for-television movie. Nevertheless, it had sufficient twists to keep me engaged and guessing about 'whodunnit' and why

Anyway, the movie is essentially about a workplace chess game played out through what appear to be some of Hong Kong's law enforcement agencies. Watching it reminded me a lot of former workplaces.

I am curious to see how the sequel plays out.",1490400000,,605,4.635514018691588
