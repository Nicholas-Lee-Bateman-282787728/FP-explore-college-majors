7987663,5,B00008WT60,"This is a fine collection of operatic gems, complete with sets,costumes, and action.  The duets are especially good.  Tozzi and Gedda's efforts to swindle each other in ""The Bartered Bride"" are hilarious, even on the third viewing.  Stratas is the ultimate seductress as she sings and caresses DiStefano out of the priesthood an hour before his final vows in ""Manon"".  London sings Iago's ""Credo"" as a gangster with chilling effect.  Tebaldi's late career performances of ""Io son umile acella"" and ""Suicidio"" show that her acting lessons paid off.",1492387200,,547,5.170454545454546
7987664,5,B00008WT60,I am very happy with this DVD of the Bell Telephone Hour performances of great singers from the 1960s.  It is well done and the singers great! Some of the best operatic arias of all time sung by some of the greatest performers of the twentieth century.  I would recommend this DVD to any lover of opera as an example of the great singers from the past!  Seller was excellent.  Would purchase from this seller again.,1369180800,,415,4.421052631578948
7987665,5,B00008WT60,"What an enchanting DVD!  This is another compilation of the best of the old Bell Telephone Hour.  Wonderful singers from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s have their art preserved.  This is a lot of fun to listen to.

Some examples:

The great Renata Tebaldi takes on ""Vissi d'arte,"" from ""Tosca."" This is, as one would expect, elegantly sung by Tebaldi, one of the greatest sopranos of her era.  Her rich, smooth voice and her own interpretation provides a poignant version of this piece.

Regina Resnik sings ""The Gypsy Song"" from ""Carmen""--and sings it well.  She displays a rich voice; the scene is also well conceived.  A nice ensemble work.

Robert Merrill follows in the same episode of ""The Bell Telephone Hour"" with the ""Toreador Song.""  He was a most dependable baritone, who gave good performances, well sung.  The redoubtable Merrill does a very nice turn here.

""Die Fledermaus"" is hardly a major piece--but it is a lot of fun! Here, an effervescent scene among Phyllis Curtin, Nicolai Gedda, and Theodor Uppman, the Act I Trio. Simply, great fun!  This is an infectious piece as sung by the three principles here.  World historically, this is a trifle.  But so much fun!

George London and Anna Moffo essay ""La ci darem  la mano,"" from Mozart's ""Don Giovanni.""  Their voices blend well together.  London is in his prime and sings his character well; Moffo is also in fine voice.  Well sung and entertaining.

Anno Moffo sings one of her signature pieces, ""Ah, fors e lui. . . Sempre libera"" from ""La Traviata.""  In her time, she and Renata Scotto were exemplars singing Violetta.  Moffo was a good actress as well as a fine soprano.  In this role, Joan Sutherland brought her great technique, but she did not ""own"" this role as did Scotto or Moffo.  All in all, this a richly musical version of this piece.

Finally, Leontyne Price sings ""Tacea la notte"" from ""Il Trovatore.""  Well sung indeed.  What a rich voice she displays!  This exemplifies why she was so well regarded in her day.

So, the bottom line?  This is a wonderful introduction to opera performers of mid-century for those who are unfamiliar with them.  And for old-timers like me, it is a wonderful reminder of the talent pool of the era.",1194048000,,2212,4.721784776902887
7987666,3,B00008WT60,"Revoir Leontyne Price  son apoge est un plaisir. Les dcors sont rtro, les costumes ahurissants, les maquillages extrmes, tout cela sent bon le vieux MET, c'est agrable et trs vocal, c'est du pass, mais c'est bon d'y retourner pour ne pas oublier combien ces chanteurs furent souvent sublimes.",1191974400,,292,5.083333333333333
7987667,5,B00008WT60,"Truly a magnificent find for me.  The uncomparable Leontyne Price proves over and over that she is, ""first among her her peers"", a real diva.  I'm not surprised she received an unrivaled 42 minute standing ovation at the Met.  This record still stands today.

I heard her in person in the 80's in Tennessee and was overwhelmed beyond belief.  I waited in line for her autograph and went back several times for additional ones.

Had Leontyne Price not been included (and there was no way possible she could have been excluded) in this dvd I would not have made this purchase.  I must add; however, the other sopranos were good and am pleased.

Franco Corelli was magnificent as usual and never a disappointment; Nicolai Gedda, Georgio Tozzi, Richard Tucker and Robert Merrill were fantastic.  Also George London, whom I had no knowledge, was good.

Must close but not without saying that I wish Leontyne Price well for she is a true American Treasure.",1164326400,7,950,4.773006134969325
7987668,5,B00008WT60,"These two DVD's are happy in my collection and are essential to anyone who were lucky enough to see some of these wonderful programs in their living rooms on television.  I certainly miss programs as wonderful as these.  If you are old enough to remember these singers you have to have these DVD's (volume 1 and 2) if not, you need to have them to see and hear the singers that older people refer to in conversation and in print.  All the singers are fun to see and hear again the these are true treasures for any opera lover.  Price is priceless!  Each performance is a jewel to keep entertaining far into the future.
A definite buy!",1084492800,10,634,4.384615384615385
