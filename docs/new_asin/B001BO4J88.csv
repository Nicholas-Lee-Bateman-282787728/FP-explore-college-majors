If you ARE LOOKING TO TRAIN IN ORIGINAL JEET KUNE DO THIS ISN'T FOR YOU. this is concepts and not what bruce lee taught. he uses a few techniques but thats it. the rest is kali silat and what he likes to do.  don't get me wrong!! he knows self-defense but this isn't JKD. your better off buying a bruce lee book or on of his original students books.",1224201600,,453,4.255813953488372
