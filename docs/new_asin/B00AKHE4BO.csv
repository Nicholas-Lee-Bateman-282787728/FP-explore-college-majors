8553089,5,B00AKHE4BO,"I was delighted to find that this  movie, on the list of the 75 most desired British movies that were presumed lost, had been found and remastered and was available on DVD.  I watch old movies and TV a lot, so I'm not too sensitive to Video and Audio quality, but to me, the print seems very clear, and the sound is good.  The movie itself is very entertaining.  Peter Lorre fans will certainly enjoy his performance, and the other leads are also excellent.  I'm a Ronald Howard fan, and he looks impossibly young and thin, but I enjoyed every moment he was on screen.",1389830400,2,568,4.371428571428571
