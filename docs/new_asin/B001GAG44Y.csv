3598372,3,B001GAG44Y,I have many gilad videos and this one is my least favorite because the work outs are very short. three episodes of 20 mins each. you have to go through all of them to get a reasonable workout. each segment is only 5 mins,1243123200,2,220,4.0227272727272725
3598373,3,B001GAG44Y,The dvd contains three episodes that are only 20 mins long. It is way to short and he speeds up and changes the routine too quickly. This is probably due to the fact that the show was 30 mins long and only 20 mins on the dvd.,1242864000,2,225,3.8085106382978724
3598374,4,B001GAG44Y,"Let me start by saying, file me under slightly out of shape. however, that being said, in younger more fit years i really liked doing step aerobics. so, to add some variety to my current efforts of getting back into shape, i tried step aerobics again. within 10 minutes of doing this workout i found myself looking at the clock wondering how i was going to make it the full 40 minutes! i also found myself wondering what ever happened to the me who was able to do far more difficult step routines with such ease! anyway, it's a challenging workout for those who are new to step or those who are like me and are just getting back into shape. i was dripping sweat w/in 15 minutes! for more physically fit and athletic types, this may not be so challenging. aside from the workout, you have the whole feel of the video. it's sort of out dated and, well, Gilad is Gilad but i love Gilad so that doesn't bother me. i would recommend this DVD. it accomplishes what it sets out to do!",1242000000,,977,4.286486486486487

3598376,3,B001GAG44Y,"Love Gilad and the way he presents the workout the problem is the workouts aren't long enough!  Each workout is about 20 minutes so the cardio section isn't long enough either.  I like the warm-up section but the cool-down isn't as good either.

Overall it's good for a daily activity but just needs more!  I wish the 20 minuntes could be extended to a full 30 at least.  This shortened workout is a result of his TV show and the removal of the commercials.  Sadly, not as good in the form of DVD because as a tv show you could work out during the commercials.. now there aren't any to work through.

You can fast forward through any talking and go directly to a workout.  LOVE that feature so that's a major plus!",1233100800,2,714,4.315789473684211
3598377,5,B001GAG44Y,This is a great beginner dvd. I stopped working out for a few years and chose this one to get my heart pumping again. I can already see results in only a couple weeks. Even my poster is a lot better. :) Hurray for Gilad !!!,1232928000,14,223,3.869565217391304

3598379,5,B001GAG44Y,"I've tried several of Gilad's dvd's and I always regret buying anything of this that is not the original BIM dvd's. I wish they would release more of them. He was on TV for years.  They need to release more with upper body as a focus work out at the end and outer thighs. I have all but a couple of these originals and I love them.  I've tried his sculpt, express and a couple of the 30th anniversary ones, but I end up just using these originals.

I also love that they aren't a time suck. Just 25 minutes and you're done. A good workout, that specializes in actually toning specific body parts every day, helps keep the body tones like new workouts just can't do.",1484006400,,665,4.2204724409448815

3598381,5,B001GAG44Y,"I love Gilad! I discovered him many years ago on fit tv. By using his shows and In shape with Sharon Mann I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, when I decided to start getting back into shape I found that fit tv is no more. Thankfully anything can be found on Amazon!

Gilads routines are short and very easy to follow. He always does a warm up, short cardio section, and a section of abs and muscle conditioning. These are great for people just starting out or for full in routines when you are short on time, or don't really feel like working out but want to still get some exercise in. They sometimes feel like they are almost too easy, but they really do deliver results. They are great for firming up and working different muscle groups.

I currently use this eve along with 2 of Sharon Mann's and have lost 18 lbs in about 3/4 months. This particular DVDs good because it has three different workouts to choose from so you can switch it up and not get bored.",1476576000,,991,4.26595744680851

3598383,5,B001GAG44Y,"I love these videos. I have volume 1 and 2 plus ""The New Best Of Bodies In Motion"".  I used to follow him when he was on tv (which is still is, but the channel that shows his workouts where I am, show them too early for me).  I've seen some post that they like his workouts, but that they are too short (20 minutes).  I agree that since they were taken directly from his tv show, the commercial edits don't really work on DVD; with that said, if you can bear to do one of the following it can work for you.  This is what I do:
1) I either restart the episode just after the cardio portion and do it again (from the beginning) before doing the floor work
2) if I don't do #1, I will do 2 episodes a day to get in a good amount of work done
3) I wear a HR monitor while working out (If I follow the video, as it is, I will burn between 200-300 calories--or course I wear it while doing the floor work as well). With this, I can decide if the amount of calories I burned is good enough for the day, or if I should do more (currently I'm doing 2 of his episodes a day--so with the HR Monitor the total amount of calories burned is between 400-600)..",1470787200,4,1145,3.9012875536480687

3598397,5,B001GAG44Y,"I've been working out with Gilad for over ten years now. I used to live in Hawaii and as a child I remember my mom going to his gym and working out I remember playing on the equipment also trying to workout with her.

In my early adult years Galid was on tv on the fit Channel and I started working out to his workouts everyday. I've tried to workout with so many others but just didn't like the others Gilads are always the best in my opinion. Maybe because it's who I grew up with I don't know all I know is I've seen the best results with Gilads workouts.

After a few years I moved and we no longer have dish tv I missed my workouts with Gilad and decided it was time to start back so I ordered this DVD.

I really enjoy this DVD because it has such a good vibe coming from it. This DVD is perfect for beginners because it's not to hard. Don't get me wrong it will break you out in a sweat but it's not physically challenging for someone who's been working out for a while.

It's very easy to follow like if there's one person who's rhythm challenged it's me. God help the person that tried to tach me Zumba I tell ya they were going one way and I was going the other. But the DVD definitely is not rhythm challenging. I also love how he's so explanatory also he constantly makes sure your holding yourself correctly so you get the best results.

I can not wait to get more of his DVDs I wouldn't think about working out to anyone else I've tried it and I just don't feel it with any other. Gilad has always done well and I will continue to workout with him till I'm to old to move lol. I highly recommend this workout DVD especially for beginners. Don't let the 90s vibe kill it for you because it is a good DVD.

This is a confirmed purchase, I paid full price for this DVD and was given no compensation to leave a five star review. I have no relationship with this seller.",1453334400,2,1879,4.078590785907859

3598410,5,B001GAG44Y,"I love Bodies in Motion work-out videos.  I get results with this DVD.  There are 3 different sets of exercise routines on this DVD.  You get warm-up, aerobics, exercises for abdominal area and leg area and a cool down.  The best part of this DVD is each exercise is around 25 minutes long.  If I do not feel like exercising, the fact that it is a short work-out gets me going.  I had these shows taped on video tapes, but they were really getting old.  Gilad knows his stuff and he shares hints and pointers so that you do not hurt yourself while exercises.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1435708800,,588,4.330275229357798
3598411,5,B001GAG44Y,"I have been a fan of Gilda's since the 80s. The workouts are just like the tv show - the only fault is that there is no break between segments. On the show, you march in place during the commercials to get ready for aerobics and again to cool down after aerobics. This DVD cuts straight to the next segment. It is still a great workout though.",1430006400,,343,4.134328358208955

3598415,5,B001GAG44Y,"Love this DVD! It includes 3 workouts, 20 minutes each, during which he works on all the muscles in your body. I just feel my body starting to transform. The exercises are not hard, and 20 minutes is exactly as long as I can take without getting seriously tired. I do it twice a day - once in a morning, and then in the evening just after I'm back home from work and am waiting for the water to heat up.

More than just my figure, my health is getting better with this DVD.The workout includes aerobics, which is good for your heart. It does a great job for battling anxiety. Relax yourself after each day of work, and grab the energy in the morning to take the day easily, and you're settled. Plus, my sleep has improved (granted that I keep away from highly chemical foods, dairy and caffeine). Thank you, Gilad!",1427587200,,814,4.3202614379084965

3598453,5,B001GAG44Y,I have worked out with GIl for 25 years. I travel for a living and incorperate this DVD into my workout while I am on the road. The DVD was in great shape and I still use it.,1330214400,,174,3.6052631578947367
3598454,3,B001GAG44Y,I bought this video because I had been exercising to the TV show Gilad's Cuts and Curves using my DVR and recording them. I don't have my DVR anymore so bought a couple of these videos.  I wish I would have got one of the Cuts and Curves video's because they add the weights that I feel work you out better. Overall it is a good beginning workout.  I would just like a little more. I do like that each workout is about 20 minutes same as the show.,1312761600,8,447,4.01123595505618
3598455,5,B001GAG44Y,Not a really hard workout but a good one.  Will get your heartrate up and it's only 23 minutes so there is no excuse not to do it.  And it's fun.  He's very charming.,1296086400,,166,3.823529411764706
3598456,5,B001GAG44Y,"If you truly want to lose weight and tone your entire body ""you"" can work with any of Gilad's DVDS. Years ago I went from a size 15 to a size 8 ( and was not even expecting to get that small) in 3 months time working out 1 hour a day in my own home!! I have had a knee injury and could not walk for 3 years..have gained a lot of weight but the first person I thought of to help me lose weight when I was able to walk again was Gilad..I have 3 of his DVDS from his classic collection (if they helped me lose weight the first time, they will again). Already I have gone down 1 size and have only been exercising for about 2 weeks. As one person wrote in their review ""if you can overlook the outdated exercise outfits"" you can lose the weight!!  And I want all the people out there who say they are physical unable to follow his DVDs to know that I have cerebral palsy on my right side..some movements I cannot do but I always come back and walk in place as Gilad will tell you to do if you cannot keep up with him. Check out success stories on Gilad. TV

Update: this is July 28th and I have now gone down another size since I first wrote this review...wow",1278547200,28,1155,3.9316239316239314
3598457,5,B001GAG44Y,"Numerous fads have come and gone since these shows were on ESPN, and their production values certainly show their age.  However, if your main concern is losing weight, and gaining cardiovascular fitness, muscle tone and flexibility, surely you can overlook a mullet and shiny leotard or two.  If you've only got 22 mins., do one segment, or if you are feeling a bit guilty over last night's garlic mashed potatoes, go ahead and do all 3 segments.  Have hand- and ankle-weights at the ready, especially if you went for the gravy, too.",1266364800,33,533,4.771739130434782

I was a fan of Gilad's Bodies in Motion in the 1980s and was so happy to try his workouts again.
