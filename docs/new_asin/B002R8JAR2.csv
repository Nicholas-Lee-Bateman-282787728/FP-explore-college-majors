8534879,5,B002R8JAR2,"I just had a baby and wanted to get back into shape. I used to dance on a regular basis years ago with much enjoyment and wanted to find something I could keep up with. I saw a clip of this workout on You Tube and totally fell in love with it and had to get it. If you like Hip-Hop or even just line dancing this workout is the BEST!!!!!! It is easy to learn the moves, you have the freedom to add as much or as little personal style as you want to, and you can dance it at your own level of intensity. (""Bounce or Hop"") I love it!!! I actually give it a 10 out of 5 stars!",1267574400,2,573,3.7049180327868854
