8127140,2,B000FUO5QA,"If you have been trying to learn the secrets of jazz on the guitar but to no success, then this DVD is definitely not for you. Maybe come back to it twenty years from now when you're a professional. That's because Sid will lose you five minutes into the video and all you'll see is a talented guitar player showing the stuff that an amateur like you can't play yet. An instructional video is supposed to break new grounds for people watching it by carefuly explaining the chords and triads and scale patterns. Sid already assumes you know everything and frankly if I knew everything I wouldn't need a video: it would defeat the purpose.",1273881600,2,636,4.539130434782609
8127141,5,B000FUO5QA,"Wow! Beginners and intermediate levels BEWARE!!The instruction is quite advanced but if your playing is at Sid's level,you can get a lot of good ideas from this DVD.My background is more conventional in terms of jazz chords and scale patterns so it will be a long time for me to absorb this information. I'm more of the Joe Pass/Herb Ellis school of guitar playing-make it simple and easy. Sid will open your ears for the more modern style of jazz guitar. Two ideas that I picked up from Sid on first viewing was the 3 octave sliding scale which will open up more possibilities for improvising and also that the dorian mode can really be played using the major scale and it will sound fine. I tried this and it fits over the minor chord just fine. The booklet included also helps. Thanks.",1270771200,2,788,4.5174825174825175
8127142,3,B000FUO5QA,"This looks like an incorrect Amazon listing, due to a query bug caused by two similar items with the same title. John Abercrombie's instructional Tape/DVD on Homespun Tapes is called ""Jazz Guitar Improvisation"" (and is excellent by the way, but check it's own listing), while this title refers to Sid Jacobs's DVD. Jacobs' other books are also quite good but this listing really doesn't give much information to determine whether it meets your needs.",1215648000,5,450,5.094594594594595
