7955299,3,B00005UM65,theis dvd is not bad. the starting sequence of the the film and the bird's eye view of the herd of caribou running was absolutley awesome. but the film feels abit slow and drags on abit about the life of the INuit. great but stick to landscape views. NOt as enthralling as I thought it would be but worth watching nonetheless.,1029024000,7,326,4.360655737704918
