966253,5,6305092060,All 3 stars shine in this comedy and action movie.  Especially Biaos character Timothy.  He's slightly cracked but lovable.,913161600,,123,5.421052631578948
966422,4,6305092060,"Dragons Forever is a typical Chinese New Year movie with Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao delivering the required mix of comedy and action in a formulaic, forgettably plotted but highly enjoyable number that showcases them at the height of their powers and agility amid much Three Stooges style tomfoolery. A villain who looks like Gary Numan after particularly bad plastic surgery and some dubious sexual politics make it look its age (vintage 1988), and it does have the single most obvious piece of stunt doubling ever for Chan (a high kick repeated from two different angles, and all too clearly looking like someone completely different each take), but it's infectiously enjoyable enough to let that slide.

Hong Kong Legends' 2-disc UK PAL DVD boasts a great transfer with both subtitled Cantonese and dubbed English soundtrack options and a good selection of extras including featurettes, two deleted scenes, outtakes and trailers.",1210896000,,943,5.203947368421052
966423,5,6305092060,"I'm a big Jackie Chan fan, and this movie strengthened that commitment.  Jackie has some of the best fight scenes and this movie is full of them, but in true Chan style, he saved the best for last.  The fight between him and Urquidez was either top notch acting or they really wanted to tear each other's head off. Two thumbs up.  More if I had them.",1190937600,,350,4.1940298507462686
966424,5,6305092060,"Dragons forever is the last film from the three brothers and also the best, I think.",1122854400,2,84,4.3125
966425,5,6305092060,"The best movie that J Chan has ever made. It is full of humor and stunning stunts, but it also has heart. The nice love story, and the crazy Yuen Biao are the cherry on top.
I gues to hope for a new film with the tree all togheter is preaty foolish.",1088812800,,249,3.8076923076923075
966426,5,6305092060,"When I first saw this movie, they were showing a Jackie Chan marathon for 2 nights and since Jackie Chan is my favorite action hero, I watched Wheels on Meals, Winners and Sinners, The Protector, Heart of Dragon and Young Master and then Dragons Forever showed and when I saw that I was glued to the TV nothing could get me away from it, the fights were incredible especially with Jackie Chan and Benny ""The Jet"" Urqudiez, and there was a lot of humor with Sammo Hung and Yien Biao. That will be the best Jackie Chan movie I have ever saw and I think guys who like a lot of action will enjoy this movie",1000166400,,602,4.198275862068965
966427,3,6305092060,"The three musketeers are back!
The three (literal) brothers of Jackie Chan, Samo Hung (of Martial Law fame) and Yuen Biao are back in this comedy  action movie that shows of each person's magnificent talents of the martial  arts known as Wing Chun.
Jackie plays a trial attorney which is hired by  this shady ""businessman"" who has been sued by woman who owns a  local fish farm.  The man produces chemicals that may or may not be  polluting the water.  Jackie, not being as confident as he is hires his  friend (Biao) to bug the woman's house and his other friend (Hung) moves  next door to seduce the fish farm owner.
Of course they don't know each  other and Samo catches him and thinks he's a burglar.
Biao, whose loopy  to begin with, resents Jackie not telling him what has happened.  Jackie,  meanwhile, has started dating the owner's cousin, who is her attorney.  Biao, goes off and tell the women the plot and Samo and Jackie are thrown  in the dog house.
The rest of the movie has them fighting back for the  love of the women and  what the shady guy is really up to.
While this may  seem like a comedy, it has several spectacular fight scenes.  While Jackie  pulls off his typical fists of fury, also look for amazing stunts by Yuen  Biao and Samo Hung (who knew a big guy can move so quickly!).  Another  highlight is the rematch of Jacie Chan and Benny the Jet Urquidez.  While  this time their match is not as good as the one from ""Wheels on  Meals"" it is a fight that Jackie has not match up to date in the US.
The dialog is very cheezy and many Americans might not understand it,  but it has it's poignancy...again in a cheezy sort of way.  So if you like  your fromage stinky and smelly and your fighting fast and furious, this  movie is for you....Rating: B-",966816000,,1775,4.355828220858895
966428,3,6305092060,"Dragons Forever has the action that will satisfy Chan fans, but the dialogue and romantic scenes, as well as the confusing plot, are awful. I realize that romance is not the backbone of Jackie Chan films, action is,  and Chan, Sammo Hung and the rest of the cast are terrific.",963878400,,276,4.52
966429,5,6305092060,"One of the best teamed up action of three great martial artists.  Jackie Chan, Samo Hung, and Yuen  Biao aka the three brothers, really work great together.  They make this movie fun and intense.  The stunts are  incredible, as usual with J.C. movies.  The sad part is, this is the last  time the three brothers team up, hope they decide to do something like this  again.",959817600,,371,4.515151515151516
966430,4,6305092060,a great action movie that brings out all three bothers. The comedy is great too. I've never seen samo hung funnier. You can see Yeun Biao doing some very acobatic stunts too. It gets a little slow at times.,958262400,,206,4.3076923076923075
966515,5,6305092060,"This is a great film!  I've seen quite a few of Jackie's movies, and this is definitely in the top 5. There's a lot more going on in this one besides action, and I thought that the plot was pretty good. But of course everyone  gets these for the action and it has plenty of that!  There are good scenes  sprinkled throughout, but the factory scene at the end is breathtaking!  Jackie's fight with Benny the Jet is jaw-dropping. Sammo sure can move for  a big guy, and Yuen Biao shines with his unbelievable array of acrobatic  moves. If you're a fan of these 3, or just getting into these types of  movies, this is a must see!",954374400,2,626,4.245762711864407
966516,5,6305092060,"This is my favourite Chan movie.  It has some incredible fight scenes, nice stunts, and a cute plot.  It's a light-hearted comedy with a cool cigar-smoking bad guy and Jackie takes on Benny the Jet at the end!  What  more could you ask for?",949363200,2,240,4.386363636363637
966517,3,6305092060,"This trio of action stars has a chemistry that comes of years of training in the ""Yuen Ga Ban"" (Yuen's Training School).  Though their interaction is not nearly as enjoyable as in Jackie Chan's first Project A,  Dragons Forever remains the last collaboration including all three.
The  cinematography, acting, music and dialogue are all very dated; for a 1988  movie, Dragons Forever looks like it was made in the early '80s.  The  action choreography is tremendous but not very well represented by the shot  selection and editing.  For example, the last fight between Jackie Chan and  Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez is terribly disjointed, lacking in  fluidity because of too much parallel editing.  And the script makes too  much demand of the worst actor of the trio -- Yuen Biao, who can't possibly  handle the complexities of playing a truly clueless nutball.  And the  misogynistic jokes and attitudes get tired fast.  Chan's lawyer  (""Jackie Lung"") is the only character that escapes unscathed  because he's the most consistent with the most compelling arc of the three,  and in a seriously flawed comedy script like this, his underplaying becomes  much more enjoyable than Yuen's self-conscious, bloated performance.
More  marks off for Pauline Yeung Bo-ling's awful turn as Jackie's romantic lead,  playing a mockery of femininity that's truly painful to watch in the '90s.  Frequent Samo Hung partner Deannie Yip Tak-han, stronger and just more  dramatically capable overall, is a welcome relief from that.
Mr. Nice  Guy, with its expert editing, and Project A, with its goofball period-piece  flair and campy sense, represent much more successful collaborations  between Chan and Hung.  For the best showcase of Chan's fighting ability,  go for Drunken Master II and Police Story.",948240000,2,1784,5.204946996466431
966518,4,6305092060,"This movie, sadly, was the final movie that Jackie  Chan, Yuen Biao, and Sammo Hung made together before each going his own separate way. But, the action in this movie is awesome. Besides this being the only movie where  you get to see the Opera brothers fight, Chan rematches with Benny  ""The Jet"" Urquidez(Whose sporting an odd and disturbing makeup  job). And hey, Yuen Wah is back, this time playing a sleazy industrialist.  Wah was also trained in the Opera alongside Chan, Hung, and Biao. He was  the stunt double for Bruce Lee in ""The Chinese Connection"" He was  the one that did the aerial somersaults. My only complaints were the video  game music and the underuse of Wah's martial abilities. I could have done  without the romance, but it was a necessary plot device. All in all, an  excellent film. Here's hoping for a reunion in the future.",946944000,7,852,4.657718120805369

7883008,4,6305092060,"The only flaw with this film is the fighting. It hurts the tone of the film. Take away the fighting and the film would be golden. There are many nice comic and romantic moments and the film is very charming. The chemistry between the leads Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao make this film succeed. In fact, there is one great fight in the film where the three duke it out in a parking lot. The most powerful physical moment is near the beginning of the film when a female witness thinks Jackie arranged for her to get beat up so she slaps him. Jackie slaps her right back in the face. I could feel the power in that scene. Minus the fighting, I highly recommend this movie",1470096000,,677,4.255813953488372

7883010,4,6305092060,"The movie starts off with the low hum of a synthesizer and the titles flash on the screen, ""Dragons Forever"". How could a movie like this not be good? Another 1980's collaboration (Project A, Wheels on Meals) with Chan, Sammo Hung and lesser known Biao Yuen as a sort of kung-fu three stooges.

Within just a few minutes of the films opening, we see Jackie Chan breaking out some of his patented brand of high octane martial arts. We also get to see some of Sammo Hung's unique fighting abilities, which is pretty impressive considering his size and finally Biao Yuen shows off some of his incredibly acrobatic stunts. One thing that immediately stands out in this movie to me is the music. It's mysterious when it needs to be, fun when it needs to be and suspenseful when it needs to be.

There's just something different about seeing Jackie fight in a black suit and tie opposed to his later acid washed jeans and white t-shirt look. The fight scene on the yacht is absolutely unbelievable and some of Jackie's best stuff ever. As usual the final fight scene is also incredible and impressively incorporates all the main characters. Hopefully this movie will get a proper blu-ray release soon, it definitely deserves one.",1400457600,,1223,4.710280373831775
