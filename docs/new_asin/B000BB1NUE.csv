2410091,3,B000BB1NUE,"This movie was made to be a straight horror there isn't no humor which is nice to see, but this movie is far from frightening, but like I said a good effort. The thing that interfers is the bad acting, which is what I would or anyone would expect from a very low budget movie with a bunch of NO-name actors and actresses.

The Plot- A virus goes from one person to another in a jail cell and turns hords of jail birds into ravenous zombies. The virus is transfered by bite or if blood gets in your eyes or mouth.

These are your ""28 days later"" type zombies in that sense I mean quick moving/running. the plot is very similar to ""Zombie Death House"" if not almost exact except "" Zombie Death House"" was one of the worst  movies I have ever seen.

There is alot of blood some over dramatic but not bad a nice amount of GORE as well not a high quality type but a good job done for im assuming a movie that had a very low budget. I think Gore hounds would be satisfied.

What the real question is , is this movie worth $25, and IMO no, but for die hard fans of low budget films this would be great for any collection but overall no way in hell is this movie worth more than $13, once agian IMo. I feel if people spend that money that will be highly dissapointed. Just know its a very low budget flick with alot of bad acting and not great makeup effects but a good effort in a movie made i think with alot of heart, alos this movie is edited and directed quit well, and the endiing is unsuspected and definitley cool.

RENT FIRST B4 YOU BUY.I RENTED IT FROM BLOCK BUSTER.

I also would compare this quality wise to a movie like the "" Wickeds"" or "" Rise of the Undead"" ( Had to edit it I put Undead there by accident, Sorry ) but a lesser quality than "" Stink of Flesh"" and ""Dead Meat"".But better than "" Corpese are forever"", "" Feeding the Masses"" All these movies have very low budgets and when i say lesser I mean the acting is not as good the plot not as good, basically not a good B-Flick but not bad,just average.",1130371200,5,2014,4.070707070707071
2410092,5,B000BB1NUE,"When i originally bought the green DVD edition of this film I loved it--the zombie effects, action and gore were top notch, with the usual scenario that works best for zombie movies...a group of people confined to a place filled with zombies. My only problem with the original DVD in the green case was that the audio track was not synched with the film. In other words, when someone spoke, thre was a lag between the speaking and the moving of the characters' lips. Rather annoying. So when i found out there had been a reissue of the film, I immediately ordered it...but I should have read the amazon specs more closely. When i received my film with the black artwork, I was happy to see the voices and lips now lined up perfectly. HOWEVER, they reduced the film to a FULL SCREEN aspect ratio!!! a 2008 release of a movie that has already been released in widescreen comes out in FULL SCREEN??? What a slap in the face. And to add insult to unjury, what happened to the quality of the picture itself??? The black case edition of the film looks like its source was a VHS tape!!! HORRIBLE. This movie deserved so much better a release than either of the the two releases it got. Now I have one version with a clear picture and anamorphic widescreen but screwed up audio track, and another one with a correctly synched audio but a muddy picture and a full screen presentation.",1271376000,3,1375,4.48207171314741
2410093,1,B000BB1NUE,"The plot of this film could have easily made for an entertaining Zombie/Splatter flick. That concept is one of a Prison that is infected with a zombie virus and is locked down, creating a flight or fight situation with the inmates and guards. What could have been sort of a Dawn of the Dead(1979) meets Assault on Precinct 13(1976) turns into one of the most predictable and boring zombie films of recent years.

First off, the characterization is next to none. One thing that filmmakers fail to realize often today is that special effects and gore don't drive a film, even exploitation driven trash. Even trash needs actors. No attempt is made past the first ten minutes to develop any realistic and/or interesting characters and most just exist to be slaughtered. For some reason the guards in this film act like there in a Marine Boot Camp rather than a State Prison and most people curiously have no problem blowing a co-worker's head off at the first sign of trouble. There is no audience identification character whatsoever, and the two primaries are a cat burgular who supposedly escaped so many prisons, whose ultimate fate arrives with no suspense or pay-off, rendering any backstory pointless. The lone female(beyond the bimbo who was making out with a guard and a portly mother(!) and her two children) is just plain excreble. Absolutely incapable of even the simplest of human emotions and not even sufficent eye candy to compensate in THAT department.
Her character's demise was expected and was a rip from earlier(and superior) genre movies. The main guard is made out as a psycho-case, but little is made of his history and his performance remains one note. The warden is at first, built up, and than forgotten for most of the picture. His young son is also in the prison for virtually no reason other than to turn on his dad just like Karen Cooper turned on her Mom in ""Night of the Living Dead(1968)"". Wow, didn't see that coming.

The film insists on never stopping and while a lightning pace can be wonderous in the hands of a skilled director,say a James Cameron or John Woo, here it fails miserably. Often the film feels rushed and uninterested, just ready to get to it's ninety minute mark and fade to black. Had the film built an introduction of the Prison and it's facility, the ensuing chaos would have been that more tragic and devastating, not to mention, more intriguing.

The editing was horrendous, seemingly cobbled as if the film was a bad music video. The film goes tinted at several inappropiate moments and pieces of scenes are repeated for no discernible purpose. Quick-cutting is often used in such low budget nonsense to shy away from script and FX inadequecies, and it's quite obvious that is the case. The use of bad Punk/Metal music does not help it's case.

It's also regrettable that because of the poor characterization and lack of excitement, that even the gore factor fails to interest even the avid gorehound. Once you've seen one stomach ripped out, you've seen em all.

For the Gore enthusiast and the Zombie fan, this film offers little interest from what you have already seen. For the bad film fan, the film just isn't entertaining enough to justify rental, or god forbid, a purchase of this DVD. If you see the DVD, ""Dead Men Walking"", your best bet is to....keep on walking.",1240012800,,3328,4.760831889081456

2410095,1,B000BB1NUE,"This is one of the worst zombie films I've ever watched. I read the plot and thought it sounded interesting: a zombie virus set at a maximum security prison. If you were a zombie fan, that would sound cool, right? WRONG! Throughout the whole movie, there is some kind of purple filter on the camera and there are a lot of disgusting scenes of people just throwing up. There is hardly any good gore scenes.

2410096,2,B000BB1NUE,"Bad, very bad. This made for TV movie goes from bad to worse. The only redeeming part of this movie, and truly, the only good part, is the first 2 minutes of the movie. The rest goes downhill. A woman from the CDC, a prisoner and some guards try to escape zombies when they break out in a maximum security prison. The summary says elite guards; there is nothing elite about any of them. Nothing at all. First off, these are super infectious zombies. You can get infected through any bodily fluid, even sweat. Thus, the infection spreads quite rapidly.

Mayhem is the rule of the movie. Everyone is eating each other, everyone is spitting out blood and yet the guards seem to be either in denial or in stupid land. When someone is throwing up blood you don't let them stay in blood splattered clothes all day, you don't make them stand in line, you don't make them be in the same place as other prisoners when you have been told this is highly contagious. You take them to the infirmary or put them in quarantine. Yet, these guards seemed unable to recognize this obvious situation. Instead, they behaved like dumb idiots and provided even dumber bits of dialogue in their macho-puffing and ""I am a guard and my word is law"" stupidity. They deserved to be eaten! Prisoners are getting attacked and eaten alive and yet one guard has to be given the order to shoot for him to take any action. I mean, zombies were literally eating other prisoner's arms and killing people and the guard was cowardly hiding behind a table doing nothing and talking on the walkie-talkie. Geez.

The dialogue is pretty pathetic. The CDC woman launched into a ""I won't leave you Tommy!"" to a guy she had just met an hour earlier and who has been bitten by a zombie. Woman! Wake up and see the zombies all around you! And run! The movie seemed to be edited by amateurs, as some scenes were split and glued back together and then made to last forever. The director thought that by adding punk rock music we'd be able to forget that this movie is horrible. But now, let us not forget the horrible disaster that this is. And the end? Really? Two stars because it is at least not a Lommel movie.",1211846400,5,2166,4.439698492462312
2410097,3,B000BB1NUE,"I absolutely love this movie! No, it's not because it has a great story, or state of the art special effects, or even a famous actor as the leading role. It's because Dead Men Walking is cheesey horror at it's very best!
The plot is rather simple, take Resident Evil (the game, not the movie) mix it with 28 Days Later, then put it in a maximum security prison and you've got Dead Men Walking.
The overall effect is laughing at the top of your lungs! The movie starts with a man named Travis Dee (Oh c'mon, Travis Dee? Travesty, you gotta be kidding me!) blowing away rabid zombies away with a shotgun. But then he ends up shooting one at point blank and gets blood in his mouth. (Uh-oh!) Then cops show up and arrest him for murder. After that, Travis goes to prison, barfs blood onto a doctor, gets thrown in solitary confinement, dies, turns into a zombie, then the movie really begins!
From this point on, it's all cheesey lines, (Officer Sweenie: Sweet Merciful crap!) cops shooting zombies, and people getting eaten.

But that's not what makes this movie an instant winner, it's the little things...
If you look closely, you'll notice that all the cops' uniforms have ""Security Officer"" stitched into the patches on their sleeves.
Later in the movie it is revealed that this whole mess is caused by an infection that was spread by a pharmaceutical company turned bio-weapons dealer. (For those of you who don't know this, they're ripping this off from Resident Evil's plot, i.e. the T-Virus & The Umbrella Corporation.)
Next comes another rip off from Resident Evil when Officer Sweenie tells his fellow officers to use head shots to kill and body shots to drive them back. (Taken straight from the players manual of Resident Evil 2.)
The fact that all the zombies act like the RAGE infected humans in 28 Days Later doesn't help either...
Then there's the sad and unnessessary nude scene... Why is it sad & unnessessary, you ask? Lemme put it this way, this poor girl isn't Dr. Ray's finest work...
And the coup de grace, although the special effects for head shots look pretty good in this movie, all the other effects are terribly crappy and low budget. This movie is very liberal when it comes to zombies ripping out their victims guts. (Too bad it looks like licorish rope covered in red cornsyrup...)

The only good point to this movie outside of it being a laugh riot is that the lead female actress is actually pretty decent.
Other than that, this movie is pure cheese! Great for a laugh, but bad for a serious horror movie...

2410098,4,B000BB1NUE,"DEAD MEN WALKING is a good movie if you're into zombie movies and you actually understand b-movies and that you can do things without a great budget, it just won't be as slick and streamlined as if you had.

Like acting. Without money you're not going to get such great acting, which made a couple of scenes in this movie almost unbearable, but if you just let it and the occassionally wacky dialogue slide, you have a great movie.

The movie has good buildup as a sick man comes into a prison and the warden, doctor, and a disease control agent try to determine what's wrong with him. Then BAM! all of a sudden nearly everyone is infected and the rest have to survive through the orgy of zombie madness.

The gore is really good and there's some pretty sick scenes in here. Plenty of the standard zombies pulling out stringy intestines shots.

2410100,3,B000BB1NUE,"Dead Men Walking (Peter Mervis, 2005)

Man, Dead Men Walking could've been a barnburner of a movie. As it is, it's easily the best zombie film I saw this week (yes, I saw three of them). It could have been so much more, but what's here is an unexpected treat. Mervis takes a conceit that's gotten popular in the past decade-- using a prison to defend oneself from a zombie invasion-- and turns it on its head for some wicked fun.

Plot: Travis Lee (Brandon Stacy), a guy who's been arrested for killing a number of his friends (four is mentioned in the movie, but the flashbacks seem to show a lot more), is transferred to a maximum security prison to be held while awaiting trial. He's obviously sick, and he's babbling about secret government agencies, biotoxins, and the walking dead, so the authorities want him where they can keep an eye on him. Enter Beckett (Bay Bruner), a CDC agent who's been assigned to take a look at him. By the time she gets there, though, he's already become a zombie and infected a number of others. The CDC, through Beckett, quarantine the place, and the fun begins.

Writer Mike Watt (not the Minutemen bassist, as far as I can tell) had a ball with this script, and it shows. It's chock full of great one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue, but isn't afraid to slow down now and again. Mervis wasn't afraid to pile on the gore, either, and the combination gives this more a Return of the Living Dead feel than anything else (and it's easily as good as most of Return's sequels). The zombie makeup effects are relatively low-budget, but lighting helps keep things on a reasonable level. And, yeah, you can see the ending coming as soon as the setup for it begins, but that's part of the charm. The Serpenteens soundtrack is awesome. I mean, it's hard to go wrong with this. And one other thing I should note: it's about bloody time, no pun intended, that both a screenwriter and a director didn't shy away from the fact that zombies, being nothing but mindless husks of appetite, don't discriminate in their victims. Kids get chomped too, you know. Those scenes alone would drive me to defend this movie to the death.

Okay, yeah, it has flaws. A lot of flaws. Most of them can probably be ascribed to the low budget (estimated at IMDB as half a mil). Yeah, a lot of these actors could have used a few more lessons. But so what? This is low-budget horror, people! If you're expecting great acting, go watch Japanese horror films. This is one of those flicks that you're either going to hate or you're going to love, and the emotions it raises in you will be predicated on the exact same things. Me, I loved it. It's no deathless classic of film, but it's a barrel of fun. ** ",1189987200,2,2705,4.47870182555781
2410101,4,B000BB1NUE,"Compared to many of the recent B Gore/Horror flicks, this is pretty damn good. Hence, my 4 stars. I also would like to begin by giving kudos to the director and crew for the excellent opening sequence...very well done.

I read all the reviews...went into the watching of this film with

the knowledge that, yes, it's low budget...yes, the actors are

virtually unknown...yes, it's a B Horror Gore Fest. I was expecting the

worst. (Great DVD Cover, by the way.) Despite all of that, this film is

not a total train wreck. I even enjoyed it. The story line is pretty

clear...straight forward. The special effects are very effective, gore,

blood-vomiting and gut-eating at all the right spots. If you are a true

fan of that sort of thing...this film delivers. The director really excelled, given the low, low budget. He worked efficiently with the few tools he had.

I've watched many badly made films and usually, when they are total

trainwrecks, you can't get past a certain point in the film.

Eventually, you just stop watching or eject the DVD. That never

happened with this one. It piqued my interest from beginning to end. I

wanted to see what was going to happen next. Yes, the acting wasn't

first rate, but it was good enough to move the film along nicely.

My biggest complaint is the lighting. It was too dark, too often. They

used a very greenish filter on most of the scenes and sometimes it was

distracting. When you notice the lighting effects too much...it can't

be good. Also, the warden's young son wasn't as believable as he could

have been. When their are limb-ripping, blood-covered, shrieking

zombies running in every direction...you expect fear in a little kid.

Instead, he mostly just stands there, looking like he was waiting for

direction from the director.

So, I went in expecting the worst...and came away with an entertaining

80-something minutes. I liked it despite the flaws.

I would also like to say that I rented two films last night: This

one...and The Da Vinci Code. I couldn't make it through the Da Vinci

Code. This one had me entertained through the entire film. Kudos to the

filmmakers. Keep pumping out these gore-fests. The fans are waiting. ;)",1163894400,,2203,4.756613756613756

2410103,2,B000BB1NUE,"In the first two minutes we get four zombies dispatched via shotgun including one great headshot.  The sole survivor is charged with the four murders and is sent to a maximum security prison where the infection spreads throughout the prison population.  Sounds like all the ingredients for an all out zombie slaughterfest...right?  Sadly, this movie loses all its momentum just as the opening credits stop rolling.

Once we get to the prison the action is bogged down with an innane storyline and a poorly executed attempt at character developement.  As the infection spreads, we get shots of guards shooting, interspersed with shots of zombie advancement, interspersed with shots of guards shooting, interspersed with shots of zombie advanement...and so it goes until the end of the movie.  Are the guards even hitting anything???

The final shot is the only other worthwhile scene in this movie.  I won't say what happens, but once you've wasted an hour and a half of your life to get here, it seems like a pretty poor trade.

The opening sequence proves that these people had the ability to create decent special effects on a B-movie budget.  However, it is also painfully obvious that this budget ran out too early in production to create a satisfying end product.  There are several necessary scenes missing entirely, leaving only black screen to let the viewer know that something should be there but isn't.

This isn't the worst zombie movie out there (see Zombie Night), but it is also quite far from good.  If the producers had wasted less effort and money on the plot and characters (that never really work anyway), then they might have succeeded in the action which is what most people are watching this for in the first place.",1160265600,4,1738,4.890784982935154

2410106,2,B000BB1NUE,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...

This movie had a great concept. Unfortunately, the concept was completely slaughtered by the Asylum. Those of you familiar with my reviews know that I consider the production company known as the Asylum to be one of the worst things to happen to the horror film industry in ten years. This one had a good concept to start with, but they went nowhere with it.

The basic idea is a bunch of zombies trapped in a high security prison. I'm a sucker for a zombie movie. I just like them, I can't help myself. Even a bad zombie movie can be good sometimes, but this one was really difficult to watch. For one thing, it's got absolutely the worst, god-awful acting I've ever seen, especially by the lead actress. Her acting is reminsicent of cheap adult films.

In this movie, this Traci Lords wanna-be plays a CDC employee who's investigating some kind of viral zombie plague like the virus in 28 DAYS LATER. It's a solid starting point, and it coulda been a decent flick, but the acting is terrible and the sound is all screwed up. The dialog is only in synch about 60% of the time. There's also some weird kind of strobing effect in a lot of the shots, like what happens when you digitize on an Avid at a really low resolution.

DEAD MEN WALKING is, by far, the best movie to come out of the Asylum, but that's not saying a whole lot. Not bad for a night's rental if you're a rabid zombie fan like me, and as long as you don't go in expecting too much.",1136419200,6,1485,4.350180505415162

I'm telling you we got limbs, guts. gore, blood, heads, shotgun blasts,  you name it, it's all here. Don't get me wrong, just because a movie is graphic and gross does not automatically mean 4 stars, I look for alot more in my horror movies. The movie I compare all zombie movies to is 28 Days Later, thats a 4.5 star movie and for good reason, this one isn't even close, but does have its moments.

Plot? I'll try, it seems our newest prisoner has some sort of virus and of course spreads this to a few inmates and then basically all hell breaks loose. Then we get the usual last few survivors trying to find a way out of the prison before they become the next main course.

The acting is terrible here, but it's not that big of a deal, because you have never heard of any of them, plus that's not even why someone would rent this. You don't rent a NR (not rated) zombie movie looking for deep, intelligent acting. It was obviously a shoe-string budget, but they really did the best they could with what they had to work with. The gore is the real star, and I have a funny feeling the make-up crew got paid more then the actors did, because there is blood and guts and gore in every scene.

If you have a weak stomach or don't like gory movies by all means stay away from this, cuz' they pile it on. They even show the zombies ripping open stomachs and pulling EVERYTHING out, and this happens numerous times. Like I said this is no 28 Days Later, it's not even Dawn of the Dead, but it's ok, and gore hounds are going to have a field day.

It ain't much I know but that's the plot to Asylum's Dead Men Walking. Directed by Peter Mervis and written by Mike Watt, this 2005 independant zombie film, in my opinion, has to be one of The Asylum's best releases I've seen thus far.

Yes, it's low-budget. Yes, it's filled with actors that aren't very well-known. But, for what it's got, it's got alot of it and it does so with style. It was filmed in the Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles, California; after all. Tony Schaab of The G.O.R.E. Score called the film ""a nice oasis in the desert of straight-to-video zombie flicks"" & ""worth a look-see for the fan that has seen all the 'popular' undead films and is looking for something else to satisfy their appetite for destruction."". I'm inclined to agree. It is a nice change of pace to see a zombie movie with a different concept than you're used to.

I'll be honest, I figured it was going to be one of those films I'd wished I'd saved my money on(based on seeing the title for this film, especially). I'm glad I was wrong about it. It wasn't as bad as I'd thought it'd be. Loved it!",1346803200,,1264,4.467532467532467
8084316,3,B000BB1NUE,"What this movie lacks in acting and storyline is more than balanced with the sheer volume of blood, guts and gore. Combined with some great zombie make-up, the grotesque violence of this flick makes it fun to watch. Its firmly rooted in the `B-movie' category. If you do not expect too much, you could enjoy it for what it is.",1323907200,,326,4.45
8084317,3,B000BB1NUE,"The premise of ""Dead Men Walking"" is actually quite smart, in its simplicity: a ""convicted killer"" is placed in a maximum-security prison.  The inmate, charged with four counts of murder, was actually defending himself from four zombies, one of whom took a little nibble before being dispatched.  The zombie plague is not widespread yet, and is therefore not of knowledge to the general public.  The infected inmate, of course, quickly turns dead, moving smoothly into undead, and since the prison is under maximum lockdown, the zombie finds himself with a captive smorgasbord as inmates and prison staff fight to stay alive.

Overall, ""Dead Men Walking"" is a nice oasis in the desert of straight-to-video zombie flicks.  It's available on DVD, and The SyFy Channel seems to have a license with the film's distributors as well - I've seen it in the listings at least twice in the last six months, so keep your eyes peeled.  It's definitely worth a look-see for the fan that has seen all the ""popular"" undead films and is looking for something else to satisfy their appetite for destruction.

8084318,4,B000BB1NUE,"First of all, you've gotta admit that this is a cool movie title!

As bad as I thought Dead Men Walking was going to be, I couldn't resist the combination of zombie *and* prison movie. Surprisingly, the movie wasn't really all that bad. The story is pretty predictable, but we don't necessarily watch these movies for innovative stories, right? In a brief nutshell, some guy who just killed all of his friends in his living room after they were exposed to some biological toxin that turned them all into bleeding eyeball zombies gets arrested and sent to some maximum security prison. As fate would have it, he's also infected with the virus and he promptly infects someone else in the prison and on it goes until the prison is in complete chaos and the tension mounts.

Dead Men Walking is a really, really low budget movie and it shows since the blood looks pretty phony and it seems that the characters just have one change of clothes (which I didn't like because it bothered me that some characters wouldn't think of changing their shirts (or washing their faces) after being vomited on). Also, there were some parts in the movie where it was a little difficult to hear some dialogue when the actors were far away from the camera so I suppose the only microphones they had were the ones attached to the cameras. Anyway, aside from that, there was a good amount of action, a fair amount of zombie induced tension, lots of blood, a few disembowelments, some gnawed off limbs and ripped off chunks of flesh, exploded heads and lots of projectile vomiting, so what more could a person ask for?

Dead Men Walking featurs the new breed of fast moving zombies which I find more frightening than the old slow moving standard. According to the featurette in the extras, the movie was shot in only nine days and that made me wonder how cool this movie could have really been with a bigger budget.",1300665600,,1890,4.602373887240356
8084319,3,B000BB1NUE,"This zombie thriller actually brings a fresh concept to the table, not something easy to do in a genre as well-mined as this one: after his roommates accidentally ingest a biotoxin from the lab where he works, a young lad named Travis (Brandon Stacy), in an effort to keep the virus from spreading, takes them out with a shotgun. The cops, understandably, think he's a homicidal maniac and incarcerate his ass. Only problem is, Trav caught the infection before they locked him up, meaning when the disease manifests itself, it has a nice, well-populated and contained environment in which to spread. Pretty soon, zombie prisoners outnumber regular prisoners and the only hope for survival is escape, a tall order in the best of circumstances.

Like I said, the concept - from screenwriter Mike Watt (not the acclaimed singer, the acclaimed horror journalist) - is fresh and intriguing, a careful blend of a prison flick, a zombie movie, and a medical thriller; however, it's a concept that isn't always supported by the dialog, which fluctuates between heavy-handed, awkward and wooden. The story flows well-enough, but it is definitely hung up in spots by shoddy verbal execution. To its credit, though, for the latter of these genres, a medical thriller, it is very methodically researched and believably implemented. Truthfully, while 28 Days Later is a far, far superior film, I liked the breakout explanation (epidemic breakout, not prison breakout) in Dead Men Walking much more.

As for performances, the above-mentioned Brandon Stacy (two episodes of ""Joey""), who could pass for Zachary Quinto if he needed to (here, then here), makes the most of his brief time onscreen, which, though it doesn't amount to much more than acting crazy and sick, Mr. Stacy does so with admirable aplomb; his final transformation into full-blown zombiehood is truly painful to perceive. I mean that as a compliment.

The lead prisoner in this film is our old-favorite Griff Furst (Transmorphers, The Hitchhiker, 9/11 Commission Report), a frequently-incarcerated, almost as frequently self-liberated criminal with a steel intellect, brass balls and a heart of gold. Furst plays the role with his typical roguish amiability, a violent scalawag with a penchant for adventure that has occasion to blur the line between legal and illegal. In other words: the bad boy just good enough to wriggle into your sympathies. Mr. Furst billed himself here as ""Brick Firestone,"" which is a spot-on porn name if ever I heard one.

Rounding out the cast is the lovely Bay Bruner (this and Bachelor Party Massacre, in which she's billed as - spoiler alert - ""The Killer""), playing a CDC scientist who's at the prison running tests on the infected prisoners when the whole place goes zombie-lockdown. Ms. Bruner comes across as a less-bite-more-bark Kristen Quintrall, and plays the role as your standard pretty-authoritarian-with-something-to-prove-as-demonstrated-through-sass-and-frigidity. Despite this common approach, there's definitely a spark to Ms. Bruner that makes her performance far from rote; she conveys an inherit vulnerability, an - even if subconscious - awareness of her fish-out-of-water status that wafts mild empathy in her direction.

Dead Men Walking was directed by Peter Mervis (Snakes on a Train, When a Killer Calls, The DaVinci Treasure), who turns in a taut thriller that moves well-enough along, though hindered in spots by the aforementioned dialog. Mr. Mervis' use of lighting, framing and sound make the prison setting a true cavernous hell, a boundless cell that allows the story to fill it. The action scenes - that is, the kill scenes - while a glorious melee of ferocity and gore, felt a bit too frazzled and unfocused for my taste, like watching a room full of epileptics all seizing at once; too much chaos for focus, which, for all I know, was the very intention of Mr. Mervis.

Overall, I'm sort of in the middle of this one: it certainly wasn't the best Asylum film I've seen, but it was far from the worst, yet while the concept and story were intriguing, the execution, both in script and supporting performances, made me too aware this was direct-to-DVD, something I never mind, but shouldn't be reminded of. With the right performances and a better script, this concept could have opened to 15 million any October. As is, it's a passable example in a genre too-often visited. Ultimately, though, when they divide zombie movies into watchable and not, Dead Men Walking should find itself safely, though not that safely, on the winning side.",1298851200,,4557,5.126514131897712
8084320,3,B000BB1NUE,"This movie had potential, but I hate how the movie was shot, it was to dark, a lame attempt to give the movie a gritty look.  It just didn't fit, there was one scene in the caferteria, where the infection spread to the other inmates.....  It just looked like a bunch of guys shaking and spitting on each other.  My review of this movie as a whole, its not as bad as other zombie movies I've seen. So make sure if you do decide to buy this, buy it used and look for the cheapist!",1283040000,,478,4.010526315789473
8084321,1,B000BB1NUE,"This movie is a standard zombie film that takes place in a prison.  It's marred mainly by wooden acting and the oddly placed attempts at humorous dialogue.  The direction and camera shots seem completely uninspired.  Sometimes the camera operator can't seem to decide which character to focus on and the camera just floats back and forth between them.  The camera work and direction seem amateurish at best.  I watched this on a HDTV with an upscaling DVD player and I noticed that the whole movie seemed to be just a little out of focus.  I'm not sure that's on purpose or if it was a problem with the upscaling.

Bottom line is that while this is a watchable zombie movie, there are much better ones out there.  Why waste the time on this one when there are movies like Severed: Forest of the Dead.",1281830400,,800,4.506944444444445
8084322,2,B000BB1NUE,"I'm a simple man with simple tastes.  Nothing brings me more joy than seeing a zombie's head blown off with a shotgun.  Not a pistol.  Not a machinegun. A shotgun.

You might call me a little old school - when I went skeet shooting and the hot casings smacked me in the face, all I could think of is ""I've got to get better for when the zombies come."" I just want to see somebody with a shotgun quip wise and kill zombies.  Is that too much to ask?

Yes.  Yes it is.  Or at least, it's too much to ask of Dead Men Walking.  You see, the problem with Dead Men Walking isn't its low budget, or its poor lighting, or its execrable acting, or the fact that the directors love their zombie kills so much that they replay them over and over. It's that the directors know HOW to stage a zombie kill.  They show us how it's done in the first five minutes as our soon-to-be-infected protagonist shotguns his way through a wave of zombies.  It is delirious fun and choreographed with expertise that would make Sam Raimi proud.  Before he made all those Spider-Man movies.

But then something happened.  Maybe they ran out of money.  Maybe they switched directors.  Maybe someone spliced in another film.  But we go from awesome zombie-blasting action to...*GASP!* dialogue.  It is at this point I turned to myself (because my wife is far too intelligent to watch this film with me, I watch them by myself) and said, ""Self, what the hell is going on here?  Is this zombie film taking itself seriously?""

Deadly serious. Seriously.  Deadly seriously.  Whatever, you know what I mean.

You see, Dead Men Walking has big plans, big plans.  It's a zombie movie in a maximum security prison, which is an idea so full of awesome it practically writes itself.  But the writer, Mike Watt, wants to explain everything.  We get exposition on why the zombies exist, how they got there, the CDC, God, the universe, and everything. What we don't get is zombie killing.

Oh there's a few here and there. When the zombie infestation first breaks out Sweeney, at the urging of an inmate, ends up shooting everybody.  Panting and spattered in blood, he shouts, ""Somebody want to tell me why I had to do that? I do NOT enjoy shooting staff members!"" And it brought a tear to my eye.  Sweeney was my salvation.  He and his hard-ass band of oddly militaristic prison guards would kick zombie buttocks and chew bubblegum, and near as I can tell Sweeney had no bubblegum so...well, you know. When Sweeney gets infected it's even better.  We just know how it's going to go down - bad and bloody with Sweeney taking as many no good dirty zombies as he can before he turns into one of them.

Yeah, that would have been an awesome movie.

But that's not Dead Men Walking.  Dead Men Walking is about watching zombies run down hallways, zombies eating intestines, zombies milling around in slow motion, zombies eating little kids, really annoying screeching sounds, bad lighting, more zombies running down hallways, random fades to black and did I mention that zombies run down hallways?

It should have been named Dead Men Running.",1280188800,,3093,4.571948998178506
