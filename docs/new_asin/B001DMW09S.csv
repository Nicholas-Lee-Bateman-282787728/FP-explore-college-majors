8294161,3,B001DMW09S,"Pros:  Nice pleasant Fireplace; watch it without the music. Decent photography.
The ""Christmas Choir"" and ""Highlights from the Nutcracker"" are good.

Cons: The rest of the music is awful; you get the feeling the person who made this DVD hired his friends to sing;
awful voices and renditions; the choir and highlights from the nutcracker are good but too short, everything else:
""Christmas Traditions"", ""Swinging jazzy Christmas"" and ""Kid's Party"" sections are really  bad.

Good thing I only paid a dollar for it, totally uninspiring for my taste.

Fortunately, you can watch with only the fireplace sounds of the wood burning
so the people who reviewed it based on the Fireplace are right..",1481673600,,692,5.088495575221239

8294164,5,B001DMW09S,Just what I wanted for Christmas morning while gifts are being exchanged.  We have a real fireplace in another room but we wanted to use the larger room.,1388275200,2,153,4.464285714285714
8294165,2,B001DMW09S,I recently purchased this DVD. I was very disappointed that  you can not watch and listen to just the crackling fire without the tunes. My friend has the same DVD and she has the option to watch and listen to the fire only.,1386806400,3,223,4.186046511627907
