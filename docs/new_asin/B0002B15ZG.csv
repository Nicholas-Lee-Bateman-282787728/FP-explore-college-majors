2074926,5,B0002B15ZG,An interesting subject and one that is not really understood.  The acting is superb and you have to feel sorry for poor Eve.,1493942400,,124,4.391304347826087
2074927,5,B0002B15ZG,"This is a really good story. It's based on real life. Joanne Woodward is absolutely amazing, and she creates a very sympathetic character, well three characters in one woman. This movie is a classic. There is sadness, but humor, and triumph, too. It's definitely worth watching.",1491264000,,278,5.065217391304348
2074928,3,B0002B15ZG,"Though ""The Three Faces of Eve"" is well-intentioned, the film is more useful as a reflection of the period than as a true case study.  I am not really a fan of ""deconstruction"", but this is a movie that fairly begs for it.

The movie begins with an introduction by Alistair Cooke, who later did introductions for public television's ""Masterpiece Theatre"".  Unfortunately the erudite Cooke is here given lines like ""inside every fat man is a thin man struggling to get out"".  This sets the tone for a film which features a wonderful performance by Joanne Woodward, but now seems like an exercise in stereotyping.

It is better understood as a pre-feminist fable from 1957.  The ""faces of Eve"" ares the good, but namby-pamby Eve White,  the party girl seductress  Eve Black, and the ""normal"" Jane.  This is a classic example of the Madonna/ Prostitute formulation as put forth by Freud.  When Eve White transitions into Eve Black, the movie signals the change with obvious ""sexy"" background music with cabaret saxophone and trumpets.  Joanne Woodward affects the new personality by sliding her hips forward, splaying her legs, and generally doing an imitation of Marilyn Monroe--- which was a very common way for an actress to act ""sexy"" in the late 50's and early 60's.

""Eve White"" is a prim woman trapped in a marriage to a stereotypical Southern man named Ralph,  a character who seems like he stepped out of the mob scene in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".  He's a complete chauvinist, a ""pea picker"" in  Eve Black's derisive terms.  So the secondary personality, ""Eve Black""  seems more like the embodiment of Eve's wish to rebel from the constraints of her marriage than it does a true instance of Multiple Personality Disorder.  Not able to function as either a numb, ""good wife"", or as a fast and loose partier,  Eve presents a third personality, ""Jane"", who doesn't know who she is, but seems like a good approximation of a self-actualized ""new woman"".  As Jane, Joanne Woodward projects a new confidence and a forward posture.

 So, for all of its good intentions, ""Three Faces of Eve""  comes off as contrived as ""My Fair Lady"".  Lee J. Cobb is the psychiatrist who midwifes Eve's birth into ""Jane"", just as if he's Henry Higgins.  He calls forth the different personalities with unbelievable ease, as if he were a magician(""presto, chango !!!""), or it was simply a game between himself and the patient.

Despite Joanne Woodward's Oscar-winning performance, this movie really just seems to represent the fears and hopes appended to  the incipient feminist movement,  five years before Betty Friedan's ""Feminine Mystique"" made its appearance.  Oh, dear, women are in a bind, and they need to be able to change--- but don't fear, husbands, you may find that you LIKE THE CHANGES.  What Lee J. Cobb's psychiatrist accomplishes is overly simple and utopian, but it does provide a happy ending in the way 1950's melodramas do.

For devotees of the period, the film also provides a glimpse of actor Vince Edwards, later to gain notoriety in TV's ""Ben Casey"".

2074929,5,B0002B15ZG,"This is an excellent movie from the mid 1950s.  It is about a woman with multiple personalities.  It was shot in black and white, which can be its own art form.  Joanne Woodward was terrific and won an Academy Award for her performance.  Lee J. Cobb is also excellent.  There is a scene near the end of the movie that I find to be excruciating.  This movie is stylistically dated, and may not suit everyone's taste.  However, this is an iconic movie and is almost a ""must see"" for a student of Hollywood History.

2074949,5,B0002B15ZG,"Joanne Woodward does an amazing job of portraying the life of a woman with multiple personality.  The film demonstrates the three distinct woman living in one body.  Based on a true story, Eve has suffered traumatic events in her childhood that caused her forming psyche to fragment out of necessity to survive her circumstances.  As she developed physically into a woman her personalities also grow up along with her.  This film is highly recommended to anyone interested in the field or just understanding mental illness.

2074969,3,B0002B15ZG,"Three Faces of Eve is a powerful movie about a woman with three personalities. It was based on a book by the same name, written in 1957 and rushed into film, based on the popularity of Shirley Jacksons Birds Nest. I had a hard time deciding how to rate this film: does it deserve five stars as the first movie to introduce this fascinating subject (Multiple Personality Disorder) to a broad audience? Or should it be given only two or three stars, since Eve is sensationalized and treats the main character as some sort of freak to be pitied rather than as a person with a disease to be treated. MPD almost always arises from severe trauma, usually in childhood, and Eve illustrates this very well. Still, the net result of this film was to produce a national revulsion against multiples, and an irrational fear of them. Even today, MPD is considered by many as possession, pretense, or a dangerous abnormality. It can be a difficult gift which once tamed can be of extraordinary value.
Despite its poor treatment of the subject, this is still a mesmerizing movie, so I decided to give it 3 stars. Be careful, though: it is shocking and can trigger strong negative feelings. If you have PTSD (or MPD itself), you might not want to watch this film.",1432080000,,1247,4.596412556053812

2074977,5,B0002B15ZG,"I really appreciate this movie, DID is so rarely portrayed accurately and even though I'm sure some bits were exaggerated a bit for dramatic purposes of the film, this is still a great movie for it's time period. My only black and white film I happily own now lol, very worth it to me.. I do wish that we saw more of the past that caused her DID, rather than the little bit we see in the movie.. And I admit, 'Sybil' with Sally Field and Joanne Woodward is a much better extended DID movie.. But I love that Joanne Woodward was Eve/Jane, and that she became the therapist for Sybil years later :)

As for the seller I got it from, my dvd case arrived very damaged where the plastic outer sleeve was so ripped on the front, that the lower half was GONE! this was not mentioned at all in the description so it was an unfortunate shock when I opened the package..

With the help of doctors Eve soon discovers that due to a horrifying childhood event her mind split itself into other forms of people, that of the fun and rebellious Eve Black and a woman named Jean.

Joanne Woodward brought home a Best Actress OSCAR for her unforgettable portrayal of a woman with multiple personality disorder. Woodward plays Eve White, a troubled housewife who begins seeing a psychiatrist. Under hypnosis, Eve's two additional personalities are revealed: a vamp and an independent sophisticate, but curing her will require a probe into her disturbing past. The film is based on the real-life story of a South Caroline woman who ultimately manifested 22 different personalities over her lifetime.

FILM FACT: Joanne Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actress to win an Oscar for portraying three different personalities [Eve White, Eve Black and Jane]. `The Three Faces of Eve' also became the first film to win the Best Actress Award without getting nominated in another category since Bette Davis won for `Dangerous' in 1935.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: A truly great performance can go a long way toward elevating any film, and in the case of Joanne Woodward's Academy Award winning turn in 'The Three Faces of Eve,' we actually get three for the price of one. A perfect example of ""truth is stranger than fiction,"" the film takes its cue from a real life instance of multiple personality disorder, chronicling the lofty struggles that come as a result of fractured psyches and lingering childhood trauma. The filmmaking itself doesn't offer too much to get excited about, but the lead actress is mesmerizing to watch, and acclaimed Hollywood screenplay writer Nunnally Johnson does a solid job in the director's chair. It might not quite earn classic status, but all three of Joanne Woodward's distinct personalities easily stand the test of time.

Producer, director and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson had come across Dr. Corbett Thigpen and Dr. Hervey Cleckley's account of the case of South Carolina wife and mother Chris Costner Sizemore while it was still in galleys under the title A Case of Multiple Personality. With the recent success of Shirley Jackson's novel on split personality, The Bird's Nest, and news that Kirk Douglas was producing a film version for M-G-M under the title Lizzie, and Nunnally Johnson got 20th Century Fox to snap up the film rights. He even met with the doctors and their publisher to discuss giving the book a more commercial title. In fact, it was Johnson who came up with The Three Faces of Eve.

Based on an actual case study written by psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley, the story follows a timid woman, Eve White [Joanne Woodward], who is suffering from memory loss and apparent mood swings. Through the help of Dr. Curtis Luther [Lee J. Cobb], Eve discovers that her recurring blackouts and inexplicable behaviour are actually the result of a rare case of multiple personality disorder. As her wild and flirtatious second persona, Eve Black takes control, Eve White's marriage begins to fall apart and she becomes unfit to take care of her daughter. Determined to sustain some semblance of normalcy, the poor fragmented woman and her physiatrist work hard to handle her unpredictable life, but when a third personality suddenly emerges, any chance at a manageable existence is put into jeopardy.

From the moment we fade in, the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that the audience is aware of the script's true life inspirations. A formal intro from the film's narrator, Alistair Cooke, goes over the general history of the case and sets the stage for the strange yet mostly factual story to follow. Alistair Cooke continues to offer voice over narration intermittently, helping to clue us in on time shifts and advances in Eve's unfortunate predicament. To this end, the majority of the runtime focuses on therapy sessions between the increasingly tragic patient and her doctor, but there are also a few traditional dramatic beats added here and there to liven things up, including a subplot dealing with Eve's dissolving marriage and the potential romantic exploits of her two other personalities.

Though the core of the narrative is certainly interesting in its own right, especially Joanne Woodward's performance or should I say, performances that really make the picture. As the sweet but submissive Eve White, the actress exudes fragile desperation and dreary vulnerability. All she wants is to be able to take care of her daughter, but her constant blackouts and unpredictable behaviour make it impossible. Shy, reserved, and quiet, she's a likeable character, but it becomes clear that she sadly lacks the strength to really take control. On the other hand, Eve Black is something else entirely. A southern belle seductress, she's everything Eve White isn't. Confident, playful, and sexy, the screen lights up whenever she's around, but her frivolous, selfish, and irresponsible behaviour makes her a poor match for motherhood.

Watching Joanne Woodward segue from personality to personality, almost at the drop of a hat, is simply mesmerising. Though each persona could be interpreted as different facets of the same woman, as Eve White and Eve Black, the actress really does become two distinct roles. Everything from her body language, to her facial expressions, to her voice, to the very look in her eyes, completely changes, and the speed at which the actress is able to transform herself is incredible. Once her third personality manifests, the performance is taken to even greater heights, and once again we are introduced to a new, yet not altogether unfamiliar woman. And while it might be easy for some of these competing psyches to come across as underdeveloped, each piece of Eve's conflicting mind really feels like a whole individual, complete with desires, fears, and motivations all their own. In fact, it's the disparities between all three women's differing goals that fuel most of the film's drama.

Though director Nunnally Johnson and his cinematographer maintain a very competent visual style that takes full advantage of the films CinemaScope frame with wide masters, long takes, and thoughtful lightning designs, the film's overall aesthetic isn't terribly interesting. Likewise, the script's relative faithfulness to the source material can leave the runtime feeling a bit dry and slow during certain stretches, with very standard dramatic detours used to try and spice things up. Eve's husband, played by David Wayne, also seems a little out of place, with the character's constant confusion and anger coming across as a tad over the top. An early, rather disturbing instance of off-screen violence ultimately rings falsely as well, since in retrospect it never really seems like any of Eve's personalities would be capable of such an act. Thankfully, these issues are fairly minor, and the narrative and visuals remain solid throughout. To the director's credit, there's even a particularly striking camera movement in the third act, that's made all the more powerful thanks to its deliberate break from Nunnally Johnson's otherwise subdued style.

'The Three Faces of Eve' is a genuinely remarkable showcase for actress Joanne Woodward. In a trio of roles that all happen to share the same body, the actress gives a memorable and intricately nuanced series of performances. The true life story of one woman's fascinating bout with multiple personality disorder tackles weighty themes dealing with identity, control, and trauma, and while some of the narrative's focus can be a little too clinical, the film is a well-made piece of old fashioned Hollywood melodrama.

To help prepare the audience for the unusual story, Nunnally Johnson wrote an introduction and narration to be delivered by British journalist and television host Alistair Cooke, in his film debut. He had originally planned to have Chris Costner Sizemore interviewed from behind a screen in the film's prologue, but the woman's doctors decided she was not ready for the experience. They also counselled her not to attend the premiere of The Three Faces of Eve. In later years, Sizemore would reveal that one reason for that decision was the fact that the original book had exaggerated the success of her treatment. She continued to manifest new personalities after her supposed cure, 22 in all, until the 1970s. She did not see the film until 1974, when she found it moving if highly fictionalised. Chris Costner Sizemore would write the story from her own perspective in two books, I'm Eve [1977] and A Mind of My Own [1989].

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented in a stunning Black-and-White 1080p encoded image transfer and has a 2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio. It is totally sharp, authentic, and nicely preserved, this is a rather gorgeous awesome video presentation. The print is essentially in pristine shape with no real signs of age or damage. A light layer of fine grain is present throughout, offering a natural, filmic appearance. For the most part, clarity is exceptional, with sharp textures and patterns readily visible in characters' suits and dresses. The filmmakers use a lot of wide shots that fully utilize the CinemaScope frame, and every layer of the image is impeccably rendered with pleasing dimension, revealing lots of detail in background objects. With that said, there are a few shots (usually right before a dissolve or scene transition) that offer a comparatively soft appearance. The greyscale is perfectly balanced with bright but natural whites and deep, inky blacks that don't crush. Beautifully detailed with gorgeous cinematic texture, this is a fantastic video transfer. Though there is some occasional softness here and there, fans of classic black and white films should be very impressed with this authentic and nearly immaculate image.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The film is provided with a 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track. Optional English SDH and Spanish subtitles are also included. Basic but respectful, the mix is free from any major issues. Dialogue is a little thin compared to contemporary releases, but remains clear and clean throughout. Effects work within the single channel of audio is minimal but adequately conveyed. The movie's score becomes integral to the mood, with key cues that are tied to Eve's different personalities, and thankfully the music comes through with pleasing fidelity and decent range. Though some very faint background hissing is apparent in a few scenes, major age related issues like pops and crackle are nowhere to be found. The 1950s mono sound design is nothing to get excited about, but Fox has offered an authentic and clean audio presentation that preserves the filmmakers' original intentions.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Film Historian Aubrey Solomon: Aubrey Solomon provides a fairly interesting discussion on the film, and while there are a few pauses here and there, he offers a wide array of production trivia. Details on the adaptation process and differences from the real life case are all shared, along with lots of titbits about casting especially that Judy Garland was the first choice for the lead, and also information about deleted material. Aubrey Solomon even shares a refreshingly humble quote from the film's director assessing his own passable but admittedly unspectacular direction.

Special Feature: Fox Movietone News: Academy Awards [1958] [480i] [2:22] Presented in standard definition with a 2.0 Dolby Digital sound, this is a vintage promotional news story about the winners of the 1958 Academy Awards and including Joanne Woodward. We even get to see footage of Joanne Woodward very brief acceptance speech.

Theatrical Trailer [1957] [480i] [2:44] The film's trailer is included, which features a rare on camera appearance by Nunnally Johnson with an on-the-set introduction from the director.

and allowed the actress to tackle three distinct roles in one. While the film's style and script aren't quite as memorable, the movie's real life tale of multiple personality disorder is certainly fascinating in its own right. On the technical front, Fox has provided an exceptional video transfer and a great, faithful audio mix. We don't get a whole lot in the way of supplements, but the included commentary is definitely worth a listen. The film isn't exactly a classic, but it's a well-made Hollywood drama with a remarkable leading performance. Ever since I saw the film in the cinema, I thought Joanne Woodward was absolutely stunning and gave a magical performance and couldn't believe an actor of her calibre could perform so many characters with great ease and ever since I fell in love with this film and had always said I would get this on the inferior NTSC DVD format, well I am glad I didn't plunge in that direction, as the wait was well worth waiting and what I love about this film is that it is character driven and that is why it got so many plaudits and now it has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

2075016,3,B0002B15ZG,"The Three Faces of Eve is a 1957 American film adaptation based on a book by psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen & Hervey M. Cleckley, who also helped write the screenplay. It was based on their case of Chris Costner Sizemore, also known as Eve White, a woman they suggested might suffer from multiple personality disorder. Sizemore's identity was concealed in interviews and this film, and was not revealed to the public until 1975.

Joanne Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actress to win an Oscar for portraying three different personalities (Eve White, Eve Black and Jane). The Three Faces of Eve also became the first film to win the Best Actress award without getting nominated in another category, and the last for nearly 31 years until Jodie Foster won the award for The Accused.

Eve White is a timid, self-effacing wife and mother who has severe headaches and occasional blackouts. Eventually she is sent to see a personality psychiatrist Dr. Luther, and while having a conversation, her ""alter personality"", wild, fun-loving Eve Black, emerges. Eve White is sent to an asylum.

Dr. Luther considers both Eve White and Eve Black to be incomplete and inadequate personalities. Most of the film depicts Luther's attempts to understand and deal with these two faces of Eve. He eventually prompts her to remember a traumatic event in Eves childhood. Eve's grief and terror led to her ""splitting off"" into two distinctly different personalities.

Under hypnosis at one session, a third personality appears, the relatively stable Jane. After discovering the cause of her disorder, Jane is gradually able to remember everything that has ever happened to all three personalities.

The book by Thigpen and Cleckley was rushed into publication, and the film rights were immediately sold to director Nunnally Johnson in 1957, apparently to capitalize on public interest in multiple personalities following the publication of Shirley Jackson's 1954 novel, The Birds' Nest, which was also made into a film in 1957 titled Lizzie.

Chris Costner Sizemore has written at some length about her experiences as the real ""Eve."" In her 1958 book, The Final Face of Eve, she used the pseudonym Evelyn Lancaster. In her 1977 book I'm Eve, she revealed her true identity. She has also written a follow-up book, A Mind Of My Own (1989).

Woodward  at the time a relative unknown in Hollywood  won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and later went on to play Dr. Cornelia Wilbur in the film Sybil. It was a reversal of roles for Ms. Woodward, who played the psychiatrist who diagnosed Sybil Dorsett (played by Sally Field, who subsequently won an Emmy for her portrayal) with multiple personality disorder and subsequently led her through treatment.",1385769600,,2767,5.050438596491228
2075017,5,B0002B15ZG,"""The Three Faces of Eve""(1957) is the latest from the Fox ""Studio Classics"" series to get a Blu-ray upgrade and it's one of the best. The video quality is pristine and anyone viewing this Blu-ray would be hard pressed to find any print damage(lines, specks, torn frames, etc.) which means this great looking Blu-ray presentation probably came from the original camera negative. Once again, the restoration team at Fox deserves lots of credit for making ""Eve"" look brand new(Bitrate: 37.98). The black and white cinematography by Stanley Cortez really stands out with grays, blacks and whites(no pun intended) especially sharp and well balanced throughout the film. That being said, the story may not appeal to everyone and may even appear dated considering what we now know about multiple personality disorder. The film really belongs to two people: Nunnally Johnson who wrote, produced and directed the film and Joanne Woodward in her Oscar winning performance(actually performances) as a lonely Georgia housewife with three personalities. Woodward is astonishing as Eve White, Eve Black and a woman simply called Jane. What Woodward does with each of the characters she plays in the film is even more impressive now nearly sixty years later. Young actors today need to study this film if they're serious about acting, that's how good she is. Woodward was born in Georgia so the accent she uses in the film is real. David Wayne, Lee J. Cobb and even Vince Edwards are part of the supporting cast. This latest Blu-ray presentation from the Fox catalog should be a must for fans of Joanne Woodward. ""The Three Faces of Eve"" is 91 minutes and was filmed in Cinemascope(Aspect Ratio: 2.35.1). It contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. Audio is as follows: English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0. Special Features include Fox Movietone News of the 30th Annual Academy Awards and the Original Theatrical Trailer. I'm looking forward  to more Fox ""Studio Classics"" on Blu-ray in the future. Until then, ""The Three Faces of Eve"" comes highly recommended.",1384560000,,2098,5.11661807580175

2075019,3,B0002B15ZG,"Chris Sizemore (b. 1927) experienced three traumas in a very short period during her early childhood.  These prompted the appearance of additional personalities--Sizemore says they had always been there, this was simply the occasion on which they made a physical manifestation.  Over the years the personalities came and went in waves, some dying away, others arising to take their place.  Ultimately, Sizemore found herself in the hands of two psychiatrists, Corbett H. Thigpen and Hevery M. Clerckley, who diagnosed her with multiple personality (known today as dissociative identity disorder.)  The doctors identified three distinct personalities, successfully treated Sizemore, and released her to live a happy and normal life.  They even wrote a book about the case and their success--and it was rapidly brought to the screen as THE THREE FACES OF EVE.

The film was written, directed, and produced by Nunnally Johnson, and he had significant difficulty in casting the leading role, which was turned down by half a dozen actresses or more before Nunnually hit on Judy Garland.  Garland was fascinated and agreed to do the film, but was then sidelined by pre-existing concert commitments, leaving Nunnually to scramble.  Joanne Woodward, who had appeared in a number of television programs, was pretty much an unknown--but she tested well and once filming began people began to whisper about an Academy Award.

It is fortunate that Woodward was so damned good in the part, because without her THE THREE FACES OF EVE would have probably sunk without a trace.  The film opens with a short lecture from Alistair Cooke, described as a ""distinguished commentator.""  As the film progresses, Cooke continues to make passing narrative comments just to make sure the audience knows what's going on, and the resulting tone is a bit strange, a sort of mix of documentary and drama.  Lee J. Cobb is acceptable as Eve's primary psychiatrist, but the rest of the cast doesn't really register, and the cinematic quality of the film isn't anything to write home about either; much is fictionalized and everything seems perfunctory.

But the big noise about the film has always been Joanne Woodward's performance.  Working from film footage taken of Sizemore during treatment, and given access to all the psychiatrists' notes, Woodward plays the transformations as both smooth but rapid.  The new character appears and over the course of the next few moments gradually settles in, taking control of the body and space.  The similarities between the characters are often as startling as the differences, and it's no wonder that Woodward picked up an Academy Award for her efforts.

The film ends with Eve cured--but now, of course, we know it wasn't really like that.  Sizemore was not cured, and the three personalities the doctors vanquished were merely replaced by three others, and then another set of three, and another set of three.  Sizemore began to feel antagonistic toward her doctors, who denied that she was still ill, and she felt shut out of conversations about her condition by the book and the movie.  These, and various contracts and agreements, left Sizemore feeling exploited, and in later years she was involved in several lawsuits and eventually went public with her own books, STRANGERS IN MY BODY, I'M EVE, and A MIND OF MY OWN.  She did eventually experience a recovery and today is less antagonistic toward THE THREE FACES OF EVE, even occasionally appearing at special showings of the film.

But when all is said and done, THE THREE FACES OF EVE is a movie that rests almost entirely on the interest generated by Joanne Woodward's performance.  The rest of it is--pretty ho-hum.

The first personality ""Eve White"" is a dowdy housewife who always does what she is told, has a jerk husband named Ralph, and a daughter named Bonnie.  "" Eve Black"" the second personality is a fly by the night party girl who sleeps around, drinks, does whatever she wants to whomever she wants and doesn't care about the consequences.  It is as if 2 very different people are living inside the same body.  After years of therapy and a stint in a mental hospital a third personality with no memory that calls herself "" Jane"" emerges.  Jane is almost like a middle ground between the other 2.  She is kind and caring, but she also stands up for herself and doesn't tolerate being treated badly.  Eventually, through the use of hypnosis, Eve's therapist gets Eve to remember the traumatic event that led to the split in the first place.  After that both Eves disappear and only Jane is left.  Eve, as a whole person, leaves her husband, gets together with a new man and eventually brings her daughter home to live with her.

Here we have a film viewed as a case hisdtory and that is the approach. The very intelligent commentator does mention psychiatry was viewed negatively by americans prewar,commonly known as head shrinkers and have a very narrow basis for diagnosing illness as compared to psychology and other fields. The movie was proposed to marilyn monroe and judy garland who both had problems of some sort in their personal lives,some say quite serios but nothing came of it. Multiple personality,or more tecchnically disassociated selves,and still under revision and trying to be understood in dsm 5,happens more frequently supposedly in north america. In the opening scene we have a marriage problem,and the wife ends up abusing the child and a psychiatrist is sought...rather than jumping to the conclusion of schizophrenia,the patient is too insightful and aware for that label to be used,there is meely conjecture. That is why the patient is seen to have different selves the at home housewife eve, and the partying
clubber not associated with each other,and the psychiatrist asks about her happiness,her marriage relationships,
discordant views of the world. The movie tends to resolve itself in this area and there are many scenes in mental wards (notice the names used,biblical,eve and the reformer luther) and at the end the film ends in a scene under
a house whe she searches for a ball in a claustrophobic atmosphere of space limitations where fears and environmental changes produce childlike fears of kissing a dead person(death scene from a jungian adult perspective)
and eventually the scene is resolved and she experiences catharsis and the divergent selves disappear and she has one self. Some food for thought at the beginning of film she is unhappily married and has many symtoms and split selves....at end happy adult relationship,overjoyed,and very amicable relationship with child,the key for this
eve,very freudian,is adult fulfillment which makes her whole,and thats the case history. That's how you tie it up...psychiatrists will not like these kinds of views,which the commentary details,and the film was not popular the soap opera like peyton place was the commentary shows,but gained some popularity when released on tv years later,

As a film, there is something almost flat about `The Three Faces of Eve'.  I certainly wasn't expecting that.  The premise of a woman with split personalities doesn't usually scream `flat' and yet, I was always waiting for something to grip me, to take me somewhere thrilling and exciting and yet all I got was this monotone feeling that permeated the entire picture.

Joanne Woodward won an Oscar for her portrayal of Eve White who is a mild mannered housewife who suffers from blackouts, when her other self, Eve Black, comes out to play.  Eve Black is a sexy and more provocative woman.  But when Eve goes to therapy her therapist discovers a third self, Jane, who is sensible and intelligent and nothing like either Eve.  Woodward does a fine job in the title role, but the film does her an overall disservice.  The film's lack of shading leads to a less dynamic performance, and it really could have used some more dimensions.

That said, she flips between personas rather effortlessly, and she certainly stands out amidst the coldness of the rest of the film's elements, including her co-stars who never seem to pull themselves out of the stilted direction of the film.

This is based or should I say inspired of true events, but it is scaled down drastically (this real Eve, Chris Costner Sizemore, actually suffered from nearly twenty personalities) and so it feels somewhat smaller, too introverted.  This isn't to suggest that it needed to be loud and abrasive, for subtle can often speak so much louder, but there is a dull varnish that washes over this film in a way that makes it feel less important or less impactful than it should have been.",1336089600,,1714,4.737373737373737
2075042,4,B0002B15ZG,"I enjoyed the ""Three Faces of Eve."" The movie was good and gives a good understanding of multiple personality disorder and its origin in childhood trauma. In this sense, the movie is very informative in understanding this issue. However, I've found some of the moments a little unrealistic. For example, the psychiatrist would often just call by name one of the supposed three women in Eve and sho would come out. I would not imagine the conditoion to be this simplistic, otherwise it would be very easy to select a personality for a certain moment and just call it out for people with this condition. Also, the way hypnosis was shown to work was way too simplistic and eventually how magically all of a sudden the character was relieved of her multiple personality disorder after remembering her childhood trauma was a little unrealistic(not to mention how the other two Eves were predicting their own demise a little before the cure of the main character).
It is definately not the average movie you would watch nowadays but I enjoyed it in spite of some of its simplicity and lack of realism. And of course, we got the happy ending that we all crave for!",1331596800,,1157,4.704433497536946

2075052,5,B0002B15ZG,"This is one of the finest movies of Joanne Woodward in which she performs the role of a housewife torn between three contrasting personalities; Eve White, Eve Black and Jane. This is a real life story about multiple personality disorder suffered by Chris Costner Sizemore of South Carolina, and diagnosed by Drs. Corbett H. Thigpen, and Hervey M. Cleckley. This story was brilliantly adapted for the screen by the work of Nunnally Johnson, who also wrote for such classics as: How to Marry a Millionaire, Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, and We're not Married.

Woodward plays the role of socially repressed Eve White, a housewife and mother of a daughter, Bonnie White (Terry Ann Ross). The second personality is the oversexed Eve Black, clad in sexy bras, and short skirts, drinking, smoking, and always ready for fun at the local bar; and the third person called Jane who is relatively normal. The viewers see a metamorphosis in Eve White who changes from perfect housewife to a downright difficult lady. The real drama unfolds in the offices of Dr. Curtis Luther (Lee Cobb) who methodically investigates the psychological disorder of his patient and comes to the conclusion that Eve suffers from the split personalities of three contrasting women. There is a great deal of drama when the viewers see Eve strangling her only daughter when she ""appears"" as Eve Black (Eve Black considers that is not her child). The constant fights and domestic problems with her husband Ralph White (David Wayne), and his visits to see her at the psychiatric hospital are very moving. When she is resident of the state facility for mentally disturbed, we find more of the irresponsible and selfish nature of Eve Black who hangs out in the bars, picks men and finally disappoints them, no matter how much it hurts them. In almost all instances we see the appearance of conservative Eve White after Eve black transforms herself; that is, when she sobers of and tries to understand what has happened, and feel embarrassed that she is sitting in the bar in skimpy clothes.

There is an interesting history behind casting. When director Nunnally Johnson's tried to cast actress Jennifer Jones for the leading role; she confessed being terrified of the part. June Allyson simply refused to play, and Judy Garland at first agreed to take part in the movie, but when saw the actual films of Chris Sizemore undergoing psychotherapy, and transformation to split personalities, she got scared. Joanne Woodward read the script on the train from New York to Los Angeles and confessed that she was so afraid of the role she almost returned to New York. Johnson wanted to have Sizemore interviewed for the movie, but her psychiatrists said that she was not ready for the experience. Sizemore continued to manifest new personalities after her supposed cure, up to 22 personalities in all, until 1970s. She did not see the film until 1974, and she found it moving and praised the performance of Joanne Woodward.

There are many situations that are close to the real story. Just as Chris Sizemore had displayed in her therapy, Woodward used a Southern accent for the two Eves and dropped this accent when she became Jane. One change Johnson suggested was making the transformations slowly than Sizemore had actually experienced in the real life. During therapy, Sizemore switched personalities fairly quickly, but the director felt that would not be believable to a movie audience unfamiliar with multiple personality disorder. Each event is chronicled accurately, and as the years in which it all took place pass, viewers see personalities appear and disappear, and transform to one another. One thing that is overlooked over the years in many reviews is the brilliant portrayal of Dr. Luther by Lee Cobb, who has offered brilliant performance and strongly complements the fine work of Woodward.

The Chris Costner Sizemore Papers span the time period 1952-1989, with the bulk of the papers dating between 1956 and 1979. These are currently available at the Duke University library (Duke.edu). The collection consists largely of correspondence; diaries and writings by Sizemore; clippings centered on film and book promotions and speaking engagements. The papers provide an in-depth look into the life of a woman with a rare disorder who later came to clearly articulate her life to the public.",1252886400,,4358,5.031855955678671

2075068,4,B0002B15ZG,"His wife's medical diagnosis is incomprehensible to simple minded Ralph White (David Wayne). Therefore her blackouts, reckless spending, and amnesia test the limit of his devotion. Dr. Luther (Lee J. Cobb) patiently strives to unify two Eves -- as different as Black and White -- and a woman called Jane with a personality somewhere in the middle. But Ralph is not prepared for three wives.

In a role originally intended for Judy Garland, who battled her own mental illness, Oscar winning Joanne Woodward adroitly depicts THE THREE FACES OF EVE. She is, in one moment, a subjugated housewife and in the next, a loose party animal. This true story of the first documented case of Multiple Personality Disorder is an educational precursor to the much more intense SYBIL. In the former, one childhood trauma is the trigger. The latter has multiple childhood atrocities to blame and includes Woodward as the psychiatrist.

Eve Black is a fun-loving young woman who enjoys living life - while destroying Eve White's.  Soon Eve Black and Eve White both get ""spells"" and a third personality who calls herself Jane appears.

2075071,4,B0002B15ZG,"Producer/director/screenwriter Nunnally Johnson's THE THREE FACES OF EVE (1957, Fox) may be the most truthful portrait of mental illness ever.  It is based on a book by doctors Corbett H. Thigpen and Harvey M. Cleckley, which tells the true story of a troubled Georgia wife and mother.  In the early 1950's, a woman named Eve White visits a psychiatrist named Dr. Luther (Lee J. Cobb).  She is having disturbing nightmares.  It turns out that Eve White has a split personality she shares with a woman named Eve Black.  Joanne Woodward won a Best Actress Oscar as both Eves; it is a remarkable performance that will also later involve a third personality named Jane.  Eve White is a troubled and insecure wife and mother.  Eve Black is a seductive partygoer.  Jane is a sympathetic and intelligent middle balance.  Dr. Luther's goal is to get rid of both Eves so that Jane can dominate.

I suffer from mental illness myself.  I am insecure, depressed, and have moments of anger.  I see two excellent psychiatrists regularly at Kaiser.  So I speak knowledgeably when  I say that Johnson gets the details right in THREE FACES OF EVE.  The personality changes are subtle.  There is no couch--Dr. Luther sits smoking in a desk chair, while one of the Woodward personalities (a real acting tour de force) sits in a chair at the opposite end of a long screen.  (The movie is brilliantly photographed in B&W and CinemaScope by THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS' Stanley Cortez.)  This is psychiatry as it really is--subtle, difficult, painful, ultimately liberating.  The legendary Alistair Cooke gives it credibility as host and infrequent narrator.  Lee J. Cobb is superb as always, and David Wayne is also excellent as a perplexed and unsympathetic husband.

The DVD of THE THREE FACES OF EVE includes an audio commentary by film historian Aubrey Solomon, a theatrical trailer, and a Movietone News clip of the Academy Awards.

2075074,5,B0002B15ZG,"I find this film a classic gem.  It stars Lee J. Cobb (psychiatrist), Joanne Woodward (Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane), and David Wayne (Eve White's Husband) in some of their finest work.  Joanne deserves best-actress Oscar 1957 for this performance.

David Wayne gave a strong performance as the long-suffering husband.  He reminds me of my father, a retired career sergeant.  Today, and only in the United States, men are almost totally opposite this character, and much less (he's been beaten beyond recognition by political correctness).

This movie is remarkable in its treatment of a true story of a woman named Eve White, traumatized as a child, who split into two alternate personalities named Eve Black and later Jane.  Thus, we have Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane, respectively: a bland, docile girl; a party girl; and a normal girl (or rather a balance of the former two).  But, it turns out, it was really the personality Jane, who was the real Eve White/Eve Black.

Through the care and expertise (particularly hypnosis) of the doctor (Lee Cobb), the psychotic trio resolved the maddening issue of whose body it is when Jane ""remembered"" the childhood that neither Eve White nor Eve Black could.  It was Jane, as the child Eve, being forced to kiss the dead maternal grandmother that precipitated all this evil.  Eve White attempted sublimation with each new personality; it just only got worse.

Simply put, Jane (Eve's real ego) was the one who suffered the pivotal trauma.  Then the real ego buried itself first under Eve Black, then under Jane.  Haply, Jane, the real ego, outlived them all.

A must see for film aficionados.  Although, this is a verified true story, it is also ""fictionalized"" by Hollywood to reach the masses.  As a clinical study, it would not have gotten made.  But as roman a clef, it won a best-actress Oscar, and brought mental illness and women's issues to the light.

2075076,4,B0002B15ZG,"THE THREE FACES OF EVE remains to this day a riveting and fascinating glimpse into the mind of a person afflicted with multiple personality disorder, with Joanne Woodward in her Academy Award-winning tour-de-force.

The story concerns a meek young married woman called Eve White (Joanne Woodward) who begins to have regular consultations with Dr Luther (Lee J. Cobb) when she starts experiencing moments of blackout and amnesia, which are later discovered to be the manifestations of multiple personality disorder.  When Eve White passes out, the more-seductive and confident Eve Black emerges and wreaks her own kind of havoc.  Then there is the third personality, the well-grounded and assured Jane.  All three fight for the ultimate and permanent control of Eve White's body, but only one will win...

Joanne Woodward's performance is truly phenomenal.  She deserved her Oscar win and then some.  Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as the patient Dr Luther with David Wayne as Eve White's bewildered husband.  This was based on the well-documented medical case of Chris Costner-Sizemore, a woman with several fragmented personalities who later successfully recovered from her illness.

Joanne Woodward, in her tour-de-force Oscar performance, portrays the troubled young woman, whose personalities are identified as ""Eve White"" - an insecure and troubled woman, ""Eve Black"" - her alter ego - a loose, party girl and finally ""Jane,"" a stable and headstrong woman who is the dominant personality.

Woodward's acting is definitely the high point of the film. Despite the filmmaker's attempts at portraying a psychological disorder in an understanding light, there are several problems. First of all, the widescreen Cinemascope format was probably not the way to go with such an intimate subject matter. This is a film that begs for close-ups and confined scenes - the wide  screen format makes that hard to do. The cinematography and set design also doesn't help and the film looks rather like a cheap tv documentary or an episode of ""Dragnet."" Another problem is the use of humorous passages and dialog that result in the film losing its tone. Although a scene with David Wayne (as Woodward's country bumpkin husband) and ""Eve Black"" comes across as pretty funny, it hurts the film on the whole and leaves the audience confused about the films true intentions. Finally, the incident and root of Eve's psychosis is never fully explained in enough detail and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

Look for Nancy Kulp (""Miss Jane Hathaway"" on ""Beverly Hillbillies"") in a brief scene near the end as Woodward's mother.

2075079,4,B0002B15ZG,"""The Three Faces of Eve"" broke new ground when it was released. It was the first examination of multiple personality disorder in a dramatic setting. Joanne Woodward gives a stunning performance as Eve a southern housewife who suffers from migranes, seems in constant emotional turmoil and has memory lapses. Her psychiatrist Dr. Luther (played by the marvelous character actor Lee J. Cobb) believes he's treating a common form of depression but he's startled to discover during one of his sessions that he's not speaking with Eve but with a whole different person. Based on the famous book documenting the real case (and not a ""novel"" as per the DVD case) by Corbett Thigpen, MD and Harvey Cleckley MD, Nunnally Johnson's script may be a bit pedantic for audiences today but there's still powerful performances and sharp direction that makes it worthwhile.

2075080,5,B0002B15ZG,"I just wanted to clear one thing up.  An earlier review was titled something like ""Groundbreaking Hollywood treatment of schizophrenia"".  I'm sorry if I quoted that incorrectly.  However, this movie is about multiple personalities, not schizophrenia.  They are two entirely different mental illnesses and should not be confused.  This show is about a woman with mulitple personalities.  Wonderful acting and a very engrossing movie!",1099440000,,432,5.671875
2075081,5,B0002B15ZG,"If anyone else had played Eve/Eve/Jane, it would not have worked. Joanne Woodward proves herself worthy of the Oscar she won for this movie. She is an actress of the highest magnitude. I can't imagine anyone else coming close to pulling it off but Joanne. This movie is amazing. It will change your life and the way to see things. One of the greatest films ever made.",1029283200,,367,4.492537313432836
2075082,4,B0002B15ZG,"This film is a classic and quite avante nu for it's time.  This film was written and acted during the times of Ozzie and Harriet, Leave it to Beaver,  The Nelson's, Father Knows Best, My three Son's, and the Mouseketeers!  So, when you watch this great movie, give it credit for stepping out of the comfort zone of many of the studio's.  If acted out today the movie might be too gory or violent or graffic.
Joane Woodward played the part perfectly.  The personalities were believeable.  The ""swithes"" were made in a way that the audience could follow.  Many multiples have even more diverse and flamboyant personalites to live with.  Sometimes the personalities are angry or troubled as was depicted in the movie. Many are amnestic, loose time, and are unaware of other personalities or their activities.
This movie just touches the surface of a very complex subject. Thankyou, to those who were brave enough to broach this subject, in the 1950's,  when so little was known, and so few believed.",1009843200,,996,4.777777777777778
2075083,3,B0002B15ZG,"Joanne Woodward was splendid to watch in this amusingly dated film about multiple personalities.
I do realize it was made in the 1950's, but I'm sure hypnosis and the switching of personalites were a little more dramatic in the time of mashed potatoes and meatloaf.
I don't want to give away anything if you haven't seen the movie, but the little secret eve/jane was harboring all of those years, that made her personality split, was a letdown.  I'm unfamiliar with the actual case, but I'd love to know if there was something more shocking going on there that was considered inaapropriate for moviegoers at the time.  My other qualm was the accent... why didn't the real eve/jane have a southern accent?  that made no sense to me.
Overall, the film was entertaining.  It just wasn't very believable.",1008288000,,800,4.817518248175182
2075084,3,B0002B15ZG,"Joanne Woodward gets one of those roles that most actresses must dream about - the opportunity to play a character with three distinct personalities.  The film centres on this woman's attempt to regain her life with the assistance of a psychiatrist played by Lee J. Cobb.  Woodward does a very good job of creating various personalities and balancing the role.  I wish I knew more about multiple personalities and psychiatry to know how accurate the film is, because I found parts of it hard to believe.  The way the hypnosis is presented seems to me to be far too easy and simple, and to be honest, we don't actually get to see very much of how the doctor helped the young woman.  If you look to the film less as a case study and more as a piece of drama, you will find much to enjoy about it.  And regardless of how factual and accurate it is, The Three Faces of Eve was an important step in presenting mental illness to the public, and for that reason also, it deserves to be seen.",995328000,,984,4.3497267759562845
2075085,3,B0002B15ZG,"This film was more like a well-informed, coherent documentary rather than a full length motion picture. It didn't really elicit any individuality or dramatic depth of all the actors. The script I feel was pretty raw and not  a suitable one for a movie. However, it was pretty interesting to learn  that this was a true story and the fact that there is such a thing as  multiple personalities.
I feel that Lana Turner should have won the  ACADEMY AWARD for PEYTON PLACE (Not a superb film either with some of its  own flaws but nevertheless very effective and powerful, with a strong  message and Lana at her poignant best).",943747200,,623,4.618181818181818

2075087,5,B0002B15ZG,This film really goes to into the world of mental health.  Joanne Woodward and Lee J. Cobb are excellent as patient and doctor working together to find the hidden truth of one woman's past.,931219200,,189,4.5588235294117645
2075088,5,B0002B15ZG,"Yes, I love this little gem of a film that inspired my interest in the wonders of the human mind. Joanne Woodward has my vote for Best Actress with the only flaw in the film being parts of the script and the  questionable casting of David Wayne as the dim-witted husband who refuses  to accept his wife's disorder. It always earns rave reviews here on campus  and several of my fellow students ask to see it and study it for psychology  class and to get an introduction into the life of a multiple personality  case. It's already a fave among the teachers and staff here. This is the  perfect companion to the film ""Sybil"" and I hope it's released  again on video soon.",925171200,,669,4.390243902439025

The movie claims to be based on a true story.  I did a Google search and would change ""based on"" to ""inspired by.""  But that doesn't take away from the movie.

8025644,5,B0002B15ZG,"Wayne was fantastic except when he showed surprise.  Never saw him so stupid and brute before.  A leprechaun on stage in Finian's Rainbow.  A gay songwriter on film in Adam's rib.  An old doctor in the tv flick - House Calls I think.  Cobb was the same character as in The Exorcist, and I loved both.  Woodward was out of this world.  Could have been 4 different actresses (the fourth being her all well).  Won an Oscar for this and deserved it.  Absolutely NO psychobabble. Psychology is garbage anyway and I don't believe this was a true store, and if it was, don't believe it happened or ended like this.",1506729600,,607,4.445454545454545
