7911801,2,B00000J12E,"After reading all the fabulous reviews of this workout, I decided to purchase it.  I'm usually a Janis Saffell girl, but I wanted to try something different.  Now I know why I'm a Janis Saffell girl.  The tape was really odd.  The 2 girls in the background looked like they never stepped into a gym before and Aaron was strange looking as well.  The tape is a new frills, low budget, horrible music type workout.  In addition to that, they are no hooks or uppercuts, which I find strange in a kickboxing workout.  If you are looking for even the slightest decent music, or even a simple bit of choreography, this is not the video for you.  Straight forward, boring and odd.  I must have missed the boat with this one, cause I don't see what all the rage is about!",1223942400,,763,4.3546099290780145
7911802,4,B00000J12E,"Power Kicks is a strong, tough kickboxing workout for all levels of kickboxing enthusiasts.  Prior to the start of the workout, instructor Aaron Lankford spends a few minutes reviewing method and form for each of the punches and kicks; even though I've been kickboxing for awhile now, I found this review to be helpful.  The workout itself begins with a few minutes of arm stretches, which surprised me because Aaron performs the stretches before warming up the muscles.  He then moves on to some simple series of punches followed by an additional few minutes of streches for a total warm-up time of 12 minutes.

The main body of the workout consists of three separate sections:  all punches (5 minutes), all kicks (13 minutes), and then kick-punch combinations.  The short punch section is the least varied, as Aaron focuses on the jab and cross punches but does not include hooks or uppercuts, but it does really work the shoulders.  The kicking section includes front kicks, side kicks, roundhouse kicks, and back kicks and moves methodically through each type.  In the combination section, Aaron leads sequences which are simple and easy to follow--e.g., jab, cross, front kick.  Throughout the kickboxing sections, there is absolute NO jumping and only a few boxer shuffles thrown in, making the workout completely low impact.  Some of the moves are performed double-time, but never at a pace which makes it too difficult to keep up or which sacrifices form.

For more specific toning work, Aaron leads an additional 6 minutes of kickboxing drills (similar to Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout).  Here, the kicks are performed at a slower pace and with the assistance of a chair for balance.  Following this, there is a 6 minute abs segment with includes traditional crunches, planks, and a few quick sets of push-ups, and then the workout concludes with a 4 minute cool-down consisting of seated forward bends.  Aaron cues very well throughout the workout; he both encourages you to push yourself and lets you know it's okay to take it easy (saying things like ""feel free to keep the kicks low"").  He works out with two female background exercisers on a plain-looking set.  I liked that both Aaron and the background exercisers seemed to be getting tired at times--I was glad that I wasn't the only one!

By the end of this 56-minute video, I felt that all of the muscles in my body had been thoroughly worked out and was pleasantly tired.  I think that this program would probably be doable for those new to kickboxing IF they are already in pretty good shape; I would NOT recommend this video to the beginning exerciser.  This workout is probably best thought of as being low- to mid-intermediate level, but I think even those more advanced can get an excellent workout, especially with the addition of weighted gloves (I used 1 lb. per hand).  However, those who prefer complex choreography and higher-impact cardio might be disappointed in this workout and might view it as lacking in the ""fun"" factor since the moves themselves are so basic.  But if what you are looking for is a strong, full-body workout with both toning and cardiovascular benefits, I highly recommend Power Kicks.",1097539200,,3193,4.9087523277467415

Format: Warmup, Cardio, Strength, Stretch
Set: Brightly lit gym-like room.
This will not be an easy workout for a beginning kickboxing enthusiast.  When first attempting the video, I could tell that it was going to improve my boxing and kicking technique immensely. Aaron frequently reminds you to snap your punches and kicks, and to keep your hands in power position. These reminders will stick in your mind as you do other videos that focus less on form, making you a better cardio-kickboxer.
If you had any questions about how to form your punches and kicks, this video will answer them. Before this video, my side kicks were very poor. Now I understand how to do them - by stomping, but instead of stomping on the ground, stomping to the side.
In addition, instead of just saying ""double time"" or ""faster"", Aaron helps you visualize going faster by saying things like ""Pull back quick, as if someone was trying to grab your hand."" ""Kick this guy, and the guy behind him!"" These phrases make me work harder, and they definitely make the workout more fun, as I visualize a group of Bad Guys [TM] that I'm taking down kick by punch.
There are very few inspirational messages in this tape. Those that are there won't offend anyone from any religion, as they do not involve 'spiritual guidance'. The inspirational messages revolve around confidence, inner and outer strength, and, as Aaron puts it, ""Personal Power."" These are messages that even a skeptic like myself can endorse.  Plus, Aaron's voice is cute.
Aaron is an excellent instructor. At the times when he stutters over a phrase, he comes across as endearing. However, when explaining things, he is very clear. He also adds frequent reminders on form.
Years after first purchasing this video, I take it out from time to time and I never get bored with it.",1058227200,2,1828,4.781645569620253
7911804,5,B00000J12E,"This is a great video. I have been doing kickboxing for over 4 years and have done all the Tae Bo including the live series, Cardio Kicks, Dawei Kickboxing, Kathy Smith's 2 Kickboxing videos and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE AARON'S VIDEO!!!
He has a great pleasant personality that keeps you motivated, I only needed to look at the tv the first couple of times I did this tape. I have a home gym with mirrored walls and like to focus on my form, this was made highly possible by Aaron's impeccable cueing, I listen to him without hardly watching and am able to keep up, not to be tried if you are a begginer. No complicated choreography here like Janis, just great smooth moves. Aaron promised to strenghten your kicks and he does deliver what he promised, please don't forward through the last part of the tape(the kicks holding a chair), it might look like stuff for beginners but if you add some ankle weights to it you will get a burn in your buns and muscles you didn't know you had :o)
This is also an easily adaptable tape, you can do it on your light cardio days or if you have the energy you can add leaps and jumps to your kicks. So it does cater to the beginner as well as the advanced. The ab section was also good, and the stretching is highly called for after all those kicks!!
The only thing I didn't like about it is the choice of background girls. Though they both have martial arts backround they don't seem to be well coordinated and their attire looks retro. Aaron could have selected a more fit bunch!!!!!!!",1012348800,2,1517,4.363957597173145
7911805,1,B00000J12E,Only purchase this tape if it is your first of this type of workout.  I would recommend Kathy Smith's kickbox tape or XKO kickboxing.,1000166400,3,133,4.541666666666667
7911806,3,B00000J12E,"Okay, I read all the reviews before I bought this video and I was pumped up about getting it and working out. However, I was disappointed in a couple of ways. Please read what I have to say because I am not totally dumping on the workout as it is pretty good. I have a 2nd degree black belt in TaeKwonDo myself and I run 7k about 3-4 times a week as well as lift weights - so I am no wimp!  Number one, for the money, I really expected a more professional production from the video itself. The cutaway editing done in between each workout segment does not make for adequate time to drink a sip of water or wipe yourself with a towel - not even for a second! Secondly, the workout set itself seemed 80ish and the girls in the background are dressed oddly. They just look like they have never set foot in a gym in the 21st century! However, I know that is not really true because it shows their names and TaeKwonDo degree in the credits. It just doesn't seem like they had a very good production/editing/direction team. Onto the workout, it is a pretty good workout and he goes pretty fast so it is a bit tough to follow at times. He does do a little instruction in the beginning, but with my background, I felt that for the ""beginniner to imtermediate"" exerciser, it really was not enough instruction to be safe at the rate he does the exercises in the video. I have Kahty Smith's AREOBOX video and found it to be just as tough - if not tougher - a workout and much safer in its instruction as well as segways between each exercise segment. All in all, it is a good workout if you can pause the video so you can catch your breath in between each segment and if you can focus on getting the exercise correctly in the beginning before trying to keep up with him. Otherwise, you may hurt yourself. I was pretty surprised at all the reviews that talked about how safe he was in this respect once I tried the video.  Lastly, it was interesting to me that nobody talked about the instructor being irritating himself. I found him funny to watch when he talked because he looked like a used car salesman with his head and hand movements and the cadence of his voice and emphasis he had on ""personal power"".  So if you can ignore that, along with the video production/set, bad looking girls in the background, and no seconds to spare in between each workout segment, you have a pretty good workout. haha - I think there are probably better videos out there for the money. I think this one should have been less expensive for all its ""problems"". I recommend Kathy Smith's AEROBOX video -- but I think I might try Larry Lam's XKO Kickboxing next.... :)",992217600,13,2640,4.318548387096774
7911807,5,B00000J12E,"Nothing else like it.  Proper technique , intensity and safety all combined in a single tape.  I wish there was more of it.  Unlike tae bo the rythmn is not as quick , ensuring maximum safety , yet the intesity and effort is at its peak , enabling you to loose the calories and fat from where you want to get rid of it.",982540800,3,319,3.953125
7911808,3,B00000J12E,"I have both Tae Bo and ""Kick it"" by Janis Saefell, and I definately prefer those two to this Video. I wasn't that stimulating.  The degree of difficulty was a C+.  I don't know why it got such great reviews.",958176000,3,207,4.15
7911809,5,B00000J12E,"Aaron Lankford has taken his personal martial arts experience and placed it all in his videos.  While Tae Bo will give you a nice aerobic workout, Power Kicks will teach you the basics of kickboxing and give you the  confidence of Aaron's own black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  It will work, tone  and build your aerobic and strength training workouts, and take you to a  whole new level.  I have been using Aaron Lankford's tapes as well as  working in his dojo for the last two years.  I now hoave more strength,  more tone, and more confidence then ever.
