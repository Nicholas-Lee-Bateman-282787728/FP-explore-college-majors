8366807,5,B002E3KWHW,Loved the fact I could purchase this as it was not released in the USA at the time I bought it.  Also got an dvd program multi reader dvd player.  Great buy.,1368144000,,157,3.875
8366808,5,B002E3KWHW,"The picture and sound quality is great, probably just as good as Seasons 1 & 2 which I bought back home in Australia.

Audio is in both Italian and English. Well worth purchasing if you are a Bionic Woman fan and want to complete your collection.

The packaging is written in Italian, but that is no big deal. I'm very happy with my purchase !!!",1311811200,,345,4.292307692307692
8366809,5,B002E3KWHW,"English is the second language in options. Looks and sounds beautiful. Flawless. The way to go if you already own Seasons 1 and 2, region 1 or 2. This is region 2. Buy a region free DVD player or make yours a region free player.",1305763200,,228,4.088888888888889
