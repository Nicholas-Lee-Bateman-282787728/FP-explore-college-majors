6451565,4,B00KVPBWDS,Interesting video and I'm happy I bought it. Even better there's more than an hour of 'free' material concerning Xingyi on the author's youtube channel.,1406678400,11,152,5.12
6451566,5,B00KVPBWDS,"brilliantly simple and very energy productive! If you don't feel some powerful energies using these techniques better give up as you must be as tense as a block of wood. I was averagely tense but every day I feel the mingjing energy more strongly. Keep at it,I am going to! After a while you start to find  new ways to bring out the power.",1406246400,17,339,4.296875

6451569,5,B00KVPBWDS,"Ground breaking! I have been a fan since JUICE, but this one in particular is by all means the best work I have seen /felt yet.  I have also trained Xing Yi for many years, Taiji, Bagua...And all things that come along with the serious explorer in this field.  But, this however, has massively changed my entire practice as a martial artist.  As he clearly states, do NOT pick this up if you think it is going to be the standard, combative, stomping, uber tense Xing Yi you see the youtube people doing...You will only be left under-whelmed.  BUT, if you are interested in real energy and what masters of the past discussed; pick it up and train it.  You will feel results quick.  And for the others, it should entice you to think about how you currently practice this art and really consider what the masters of old were really chasing.  My training has never been the same since, xing yi has never been the same since, and it has helped me in my taiji practice as well.  It is simply amazing how clear and concise the instruction is, and if you actually train it, you will enjoy it.  You can tell Meredith has just released an incredibly rare gem of material here, and I would consider this to be one of the best contemporary contributions the internal martial arts world. Yep.",1404518400,38,1279,4.454935622317596
6451570,5,B00KVPBWDS,"I have been practicing some form of Xingyi for nearly 17 years now (not to mention Taiji and Bagua and meditation and qigong and need I go on...). Despite having tremendous experiences and insights during that time as I practiced both the combative and the energy side of these arts, Scott's teaching made me realize that I had only scratched the surface. Within a month of practicing this stuff, I was seeing results that blew all my previous training out of the water. And that was just with 10 - 15 minutes a day.

My practice has only broadened and deepened since then with even greater progress and energy experiences than I imagined possible a few years ago. For all of the martial prowess I may have developed, or insights I may have gleaned, or sensitivity I may have gained, or even energetic feeling I may have acquired in all my training, nothing holds a candle to the sheer efficiency with which Scott's approach yields remarkable progress in energy development. The teaching is clear and to the point. It is solidly rooted in his own personal experience. And it honors the past masters while still addressing the issue in a straightforward, contemporary, and non-mystical manner.

WARNING: This is straight-up energy practice. Don't buy this if you are looking for another combative approach to give you an edge in your training. Do buy this if you are AT ALL interested in taking your energy practice to a completely different level.",1403740800,60,1447,4.807228915662651
6451571,5,B00KVPBWDS,"If you think that Xingyi involves foot stomping, heavy punches then this isn't for you. If however you are curious about HOW the old masters like SunLuTang and GaoYunShen got their energy then this is for you. Again this is an examination of of this art as an energy art. Well i can tell you that if you do what's in the video then you will start to feel this ENERGY, not as an idea, but as an experience!

6451574,5,B00KVPBWDS,"This isn't for fighting or for doing a pretty dance, it's for energy cultivation. If you have been a martial artist for some time, and have wondered if Qi is real, or if all there is to it is just a little warm fuzzy tingle here and there, you need to get this dvd, (and probably some of his other materials). This material will teach you clearly how to cultivate real energy that you can feel without any doubt or uncertainty.

With most things in life, whatever is most popular is not really the best. Whatever most people think is not really quite correct. If you think you already know something about Qi, you may be initially taken aback by the material presented here. All I can say is, put it to the test by following the instructions exactly as presented, and you will get exactly the results he describes. Yes it takes time, no it's not exactly easy - but it works. This is the real deal guys. Check your ego at the door, relax, and just do it.

I've been doing Scott Meredith's version of Xingyi pretty consistently for about 6 months now, and while I am not anywhere near the higher levels of development that he describes, I am getting consistent results according to the pattern in which he says they will come. I can feel the ming jolt on a regular basis now, and sometimes other deeper sensations too, although not consistently yet.

The other great thing about this is that Mr. Meredith himself will answer your emails personally. So you don't just get a book or a dvd - it comes with great ""customer support"" as well. I've never met him in person but I feel like I know him now because he has answered many of my questions. He is a sincere guy who just wants to point everybody to the best approach to training that will give great results.",1467331200,6,1757,4.383435582822086

6451576,3,B00KVPBWDS,"As a Taiji player practicing for about 19 years now and teaching for 7 I am always interested in internal energy work. But as a videographer I was distracted by the poor quality of the video. I was only able to access the last two chapters of the DVD, ""Animal 3 Snake"" & ""Taiji vs XingYi Energies"" (and the credits). The material was fairly well presented and interesting. but the beginning music of the chapter drowned out Scotts presentation for about 20 seconds or so. There was much wavering back and forth but I attributed this to either nervousness of being in front of a camera with no teleprompter or actual internal energy. The backdrop (studio ??) was kinda of sparse but certainly a lot better than the Taiji Peng DVD which was an actual hanging backdrop that didn't hide very much of the rest of the room. The camera work wasn't much better. My advice would be to fire the videographer and get a more experienced one that excels in video editing and camerawork. This would go a long way to selling Scott's work as he appears to be an experienced martial arts person and a fairly good presenter of that knowledge. The books not so much because they are somewhat difficult to read. Let's hope his planned DVD on ""Tai Chi Ground Radical ZMQ Energies"" are better produced.
I realize by the many great reviews that lots of people like the DVD. My review is just one guys opinion.",1462320000,4,1386,4.52589641434263

Well done Scott and all involved with this definately Internal and easy to follow Art, if you are listening and watching and practising this DVD carefully, and excited about the next day's training via this DVD. And are lucky to find a Master to teach you, even for just one hour a week, as I have found now about this tingling, exciting, cannot wait to learn and have the DVD their to support me each time I get home from the hall..!

Even if you don't find a Sifu who can teach you, at least you can quote to them this DVD and some of it's now Internal-sparking-outward potential, but also immense reality.

His expression of the energy techniques are Genius. Now I currently train with a Xing Yi Quan master for 15 years training intensely in Xing Yi and Ba Qua and I have felt these energy but could not define its meaning or articulate its content and my Master could not explain it or translate it simply, but Scott does it so  clear and simple that it is, to me, a work of a brilliant practitioner, and Scott is who I call the real mcCory, cause there are tons of phonies out there, Scott is legit. Now don't be fooled by his body type and demeanor, because you will fall into the trap of the American idea of a martial artist and what your doing is confusing this idea with a muscular karate guy. Have you ever noticed that most real internal masters are either really skinny or have a pop belly, but are not built like Arnold Schwarzenegger because they are  Masters of a very subtle art. Great job Scott, Im a real fan. Brian",1426464000,11,1149,4.290322580645161

I found this DVD to be good followup to Scotts book ""radical xing yi  energetics""
The two together are a good team to get one started and along the way in core energetic development in xing yi and applicable or supportive to other  martial arts [ internal or otherwise]
Scott cuts through the crap and gets down to what really makes this internal martial art work ...as it did for the old masters of renown.
It does not contain all of the animal forms, but will get you on your way to energetic development sadly missing in lots of classes and instruction.
The DVD s I recieved did not play on any computers i have...nor my friends. I returned one and 2nd one same thing. it does however play on an old DVD player. still worth the money and aggravation. Would have given it 5 stars except for that.
PS.Scott is doing anyone that will put in the time and work a real favor via the book and DVD. But you have to relax all extraneous tension in order for these exercises to work.",1421452800,8,1010,4.255208333333333
6451586,5,B00KVPBWDS,"This has to be about the best single video about xingyi I have ever watched. I am an experienced martial artist of over 30 years. I hold a Black Belt in Hapkido and Instructor certification in Muay Thai from the World Muay Thai Council as well as being a Red Sash under instructor in Shaolin Lohan Kung Fu. I studied the first two in South Korea and Thailand respectively. I had a crude fighting style that I had developed as a result of growing up in a rough school. It consisted of techniques that I knew would work in a street fight. Before I ever studied martial arts officially I was interested in Xingyi because the stances and movements most reflected the techniques I had developed from the ""school of hard knocks"". I refined and added to it from the martial arts I would study. When I first went to South Korea I began studying Taekkyon, a traditional Korean dance martial art. My teacher was intrigued with my fighting style as I was able to match some of his senior students but could see that my training was incomplete. He spent the next two years teaching me proper martial technique from an Eastern perspective. After this was accomplished I had ""filled in all the holes"" and my lifelong fighting style was seemingly bulletproof. I then began to revisit the style of Xingyiquan though I had only studied from books and a few videos. By drawing from my martial experience I was able to produce some of the results Scott demonstrates on the video. I had come to the conclusion that Xingyiquan was more of a martial power generation technique than an actual systemized hand-to-hand combat style. His analysis matches my own as to the writings of the old masters. I just have to say that I am not sure a total beginner would be able to benefit as much as a seasoned martial artist but this stuff is the real deal. I have many techniques that I have developed for generating the energies that differ from Scott's but I must say that his definitely work as well or even better than my own.

6451587,5,B00KVPBWDS,"A very interesting book. I was aware of some of these energy paths from previous training, but this has really moved me forward and closed a lot of gaps in my understanding. I have only come across 1 other teacher who can explain some of these concepts.

6451590,5,B00KVPBWDS,"Excellent video, it's well explained and provides rare insight to Xing I. I've lived in Asia for 20 years and have been training in Martial arts for 30. When you live in Asia and train in Asia you realize their is slot of fluff and westernization of the arts in the states. Also just a lot of incorrect ideas about training. Scott breaks through this well. Point in fact I first experienced Xing I 18 years ago and my instructor said no foot stamping only relax. Xing I not karate it's is Nei gong. 5 stars!!!

I put the dvd in the player to watch it and was instantly distracted by the extra movement of his rocking back and forth so much that I lost interest in it..

6451595,3,B00KVPBWDS,"His Chinese seems poor and translations seem suspect due to clear lack of fluency and inability to enunciate Chinese properly leading to a suspicion that the translations which are precisely the same as published translations are lifted from other publications and one wonders if author is attempting to create an impression that he translated from original when perhaps he did not.  No special insight is offered by such offered translation. Chinese poetics since they are not day to day Chinese characters are not so easy to translate or pierce in their full meaning without deep understanding of radicals and their historic and idiomatic meaning.  Can't say for sure.  But we should give him the benefit of the doubt.

Performance is weak but the theme of relaxation is good and emphasis on use of relaxation and pulling from the bottom of the feet is good.  This is not new or revolutionary but if a person is not getting this point from their own practice it is a positive and will be valuable to such beginner.  Zhan Zhang training takes care of this issue with dramatically greater affect and comprehensiveness; and one need only persist in it for at least one hour a day for 600 days.  His point about relaxation and providing an easy version of the 5 fists are valuable.  Some people have not arrived at his basic insight even after some years because of poor instruction.  this is another reason for making the video in my estimation.  It should be noted that blood rushing to the forearms is not necessarily proof of Qi.  Qi follows the blood, Strong Qi leads the blood directed by mind.  Presentation is a bit offensive and hard to watch.  Zhan Zhang is the traditional training to achieve the result he is promoting.  His method is an ""easy"" and less effective method.",1412035200,8,1781,4.758957654723127
6451596,5,B00KVPBWDS,"Even very good teachers of various oriental martial arts systems (Tai Chi, Ba Gua, Xing Yi) may leave their students high and dry, never really having experienced or understood the foundations of the art.  So, most often, these are all taught as a kind of ""Chinese ballet.""  The student is left hoping that something will eventually ""click"" if they practice long enough.  That almost never happens.  So, usually we are left with two sorts of students.  One is more confident and hallucinates that their own Chinese ballet is the whole system in all its fulfillment, when, in actual fact, they know nothing---or perhaps less than nothing.  One is less confident and (correctly) imagines that the whole thing is a lost cause---and it's their fault.  The situation is actually very discouraging.  For those who hallucinate that they have achieved some fighting skills, it could even be dangerous.

Into this disappointing situation, we have injected several DVD's and books by Scott Meredith.  This DVD is particularly practical and helpful, and I have found it suitable as a first real guide to the ""internal energy arts"" of these eastern methods.  I think Meredith does exceptionally well in telling what this IS NOT.  In the form this instructional DVD teaches, Xing Yi has nothing to do with self defense---nothing at all.  That hallucination is removed, and I think that's really very important.  Secondly, he frees the student from the unending tiny, detailed adjustments that teachers ordinarily give.  They will say something discouraging (purposely discouraging) and move your hand a couple of centimeters while reorienting it by a couple of degrees---tiny adjustments.  The student may find no difference either before or after the adjustment.  Meredith points out that this whole process is irrelevant, and that is quite important.

Most importantly, Meredith tells quite clearly what the inner experience of these arts really is and how this is achieved, how does the student get there, too.  This, I think, is very valuable and a great service to people like me.  I've been a crummy martial arts student for decades, not because I want to beat somebody up (I don't), but because I want profound good health and improved perceptions.  So, although I am a bad student and have no one to adjust my positions, the guidance in the DVD is enough that I've felt bits of the Ming Jing energy and a tiny bit of the An Jing energy a few times.  Can I make it happen all the time and at will?  Certainly not.  I practice quite a lot and get small tastes of it.  The important thing is that I know how to practice and what to look for to see whether I'm getting it.  For me, at least, it's not a magic secret that lets me become The Green Hornet in two practice sessions.  It isn't like that.  I can practice quite a little bit and get a small taste of it.  But I get a small taste of the real thing and not the fake ways that come up so often in the world of ""martial arts.""  Seriously, if you find some great Tai Chi master who is invulnerable to attack of any kind, it's probably the real thing.  However, he didn't get that way by beating up 1000 different people, and he probably has no wish to beat up anyone.  He's just cultivated his inner nature enough to be beyond attack.

This is really, really good stuff for anybody that sincerely wants to put in the time and attention to make it work for him(her)self.  It is a really, really generous sharing of information that could help the life and times of many people.  I think it will do harm to no one.

I enjoyed training with my teacher, really liked him as a person, and deeply respected his knowledge and work ethic...but I didn't really get what I was looking for from his method. There was lots of conventional punching and kicking and self defense, and even chi gung training for internal energy development...but never did I get a sense of  real internal energy as described in the Classics.

Eventually, I found it with Scott Meredith. HE had what I was looking for with Xing Yi.

So...if, like me, you have been dinking around with internal martial arts without any particular success, and are looking for a breakthrough insight into the practice of internal martial arts in general, and Xing Yi in particular...well, this is a DVD you ought to see. It offers several very helpful and useful insights into the ""real"" practice of Xing Yi - not for self defense, not for the stage, and not for the ring, but as an energy practice.

The approach Scott Meredith offers here is simple, practical, and easy to replicate if you are willing to put aside your notions of what you ""think"" an ""internal"" martial should be and just try it the way he shows it here. You can save the theatrics, aesthetics, historical traditions, and combat concerns for other parts of your martial arts development (and yes, those are all worth pursuing for their own sake). Just practice the five fists and three of the traditional 12 animals as shown  here, include a bit of SanTiShi and a few other supplemental drills, and you will have yourself a very satisfying and rewarding practice.

A small caveat: Scott's teaching style and demeanor might not be for everyone, especially traditionalists or people who want to be (or already are) ""special operators"" or MMA fighters. I didn't have a problem with it because he seems to be entirely free of machismo, arrogance, false pride, or defensiveness about the value of what he has to offer.

Another caveat: the lectures and the demonstrations are clear and easy to see (his videographer knows his job), but the video format is pretty basic (no ""chapters"" to skip to in the Amazon streaming DVD that I bought).

By all means, read and practice the material of some of the other fine teachers and fighters out there if you want to punch people hard or win medals in forms competition at martial art tournaments. Those are fine pursuits! But try the methods in this DVD if you want the experience of real internal energy.",1498608000,4,2699,4.715498938428874
