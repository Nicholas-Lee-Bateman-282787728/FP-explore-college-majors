301129,4,6300271706,"For anyone that thinks that the Wanderers is just another nostalgic film about New York City street gangs in the 1950's, they are wrong. One has to carefully unravel the social undercurrents that stream below the surface of a seemingly insignificant story about a group of Bronx teenagers called the  Wanderers.  William Andrews is cleverly cast as the dominating Emilio; the  insecure father of Wanderer member Joey.  Joey is a bright, artistic teen  who cannot fill the blue collar, tough guy pretense that his father hopes  will keep him trapped in tenament obscurity.  Middle aged Emilio hides his  social inadequacies by lifting weights and entering amatuer body building  contests in hopes of finally beating ""the Greek"", his unknown  nemesis. Emilio's wife (Olympia Dukakis) can only ponder younger days while  smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee in her housecoat.  She is hopelessly  content, just like many of the second generation Italian and Greek women  that settled in the Bronx with their families in the 1950's. She is not  happy,  neither is Emilio who only finds temporary bliss when he sleeps with the  alcoholic widow who lives down the hall.  These are unfulfilled adults who  live together, eat together, and sleep together, but cannot tear themselves  away from their shallow lifestyle. The Wanderers, full of energy, youth,  and bravado do; well some of them anyway.  The Wanderers led by Richie (Ken  Wahl) are about to cross the threshold into manhood.  Highschool graduation  looms near and lower class European immigrants in N.Y.C. had few career  choices in the late 50's and early 60's.  Most teens married early and  rooted themselves in jobs provided by friends or family.  Throughout the  film's progression Joey and Richie slowly begin to realize their plight,  while also becoming aware of a powerful unconventional cultural change that  is creeping into the seemingly stable structure of post World War II  America. Karen Allen in one of her better film performances represents the  tide of change that is about to arrive.  Nina, pretty,  educated,independent, and daring is no close minded, gum snapping girl of  the 50's. Nina embodies a multi-dimensional free spirit; she doesn't need a  red jacket with a gang name emblazoned on the back to make her social  statment. She is everything that Richie and Joey's mom will never be.  When  Joey falls for Nina after Richie and the gang harass her on a street  corner, pathos sets in because Richie's handsome looks attracts Nina's  attention.  Maybe Nina feels that she can lure Richie into her bohemian  lifestyle.  In one of the most culturally dichotomous scenes ever captured  on film, Richie with his slicked backed DA haircut and gang jacket peers  through the window of a smokey coffeehouse focusing in on Nina immersed in  conversation with other educated rebels. No coffeehouse dialogue is heard,  none is needed, only the lyrics of Dylan's ""The Times They Are A  Changing"" portends the future. Friendships are destroyed, group  members flee, others stay trapped in the conventional lifestyle that has  been planned for them. One of the most disturbing additions in the film is  the inclusion of the gang the Duckie Boys. They appear in smokey, dark,  slow motion frames.  They never speak and their presence is mystifying.  They appear, disappear, and then re-appear. Who or what do they represent?  Theories abound from their symbolic representation of the impending Viet  Cong menace, to the aborhant treatment of the mentally retarded. Until  recently mentally handicapped people were considered outcasts of society by  all races.  Maybe this is why all the racially segregated gangs join  together in the confrontation with the Duckie Boys.  Homosexuality is  treated and exposed in a bizarre way during the film.  The Baldies are  easily distinguished by their clean shaven domes, yet in the transitional  period from the 50's to the 60's few homosexuals were ready to come out of  the closet.  The character Terror is the most intimidating Baldi, 300  pounds of presence who is broken down by a pint sized girl who wishes she  was a boy so their relationship can be consummated. On a final note, Tony  Ganios, who became famous in the role of Meat in the Porky flicks makes his  film debut in the Wanderers. His character is not allowed much latitude,  but his sheer presence as the tough heavy loner is memorable.  LEAVE THE  KID ALONE !",956880000,30,4441,5.054091539528433
301130,5,6300271706,"I really liked this film. Yes, it's a coming-of age story that was ignored by most critics at the time of its release, probably blinded by the ""American Graffiti"" fog. I think The Wanderers is better and more  enjoyable than ""American Graffiti"", which was fun and engaging,  but slight. The Wanderers provides much more insights into the time and era  of the 1960's. If Warner Bros. were smart, they would rerelease this in a  letterboxed Special Edition on tape and DVD.",953769600,4,471,4.777777777777778

As the author of several books on Amazon, including the one above, I think it is important to review items in two parts: the quality of the item and the quality of the specific version. In this case, that would be the quality of the film The Wanderers, and the quality of the DVD I received:

In this case, BOTH deserve five stars.

FILM:The Wanderers is one of my all-time favorite flims, with memorable performances by an array of actors, great footage of The Bronx in an early 1960s setting and an outstanding doo-wop soundtrack. I never get tired of watching it.

DVD: This DVD was perfect. Excellent condition, with great bonus material.",1505088000,,1015,6.333333333333333

301471,5,6300271706,"It tells the story of several Italian-American youths growing up together amid the various gangs of 1963 New York City. The film stars Ken Wahl, features Karen Allen and was directed by Philip Kaufman. In an interview for American Film in November 1983, Kaufman (who ran with a gang whilst growing up in Chicago in the 1950s) said he ""had been wanting to do a gang movie for years - the urban experience, the darker side of teenagers growing up."" Kaufman and his wife Rose wrote the screenplay, making a more cohesive story out of Price's episodic novel. Years later, Kaufman said, ""I think Richard Price would say that his novel was really a bunch of short stories, and we really tried to make one story out of them all.""  The Kaufmans also swapped characteristics between the individual Wanderers in the transition from novel to film. For instance, in the book it is Wanderer Buddy Borsalino who marries Despie Galasso; in the movie, protagonist Richie who marries Despie, and Buddy is relegated to a supporting role in the story. Also, in the book, one of the major characters is a Wanderer named Eugene, who does not appear in the movie at all.",1370995200,2,1148,4.683168316831683

I think The Warriors is the top movie about gangs but this movie is a darker more realistic, less optimistic view of gangs in the 1950's and 1960's.

Yea!  Gotta get a copy so can see Ken Wahl in his prime.

Also want to see the gang fight between the Wanderers with the help of the the African American Gang and the Oriental gang against the Duchy boys....a really unorganized bunch of Anarchists wearing Khaki pants. Other gangs that can't stand one another join together to quell the tide of mayhem, berserking and anarchy as represented by the Duchy boys.

But im sure alot of the older generation would stand right with me on this one. I guess its just that the world changed in so many ways. And things are more complicated today.

301497,5,6300271706,"The Wanderers is cult classic film about teenagers growing up in a gang New York.

The Wanderers are an all Italian gang, who live in the same area. Other gangs include the Dell-Bombers (all black gang), the Wongs (all Chinese gang), the Baldies (tough bald head gang) and the Ducky Boys (Irish gang).

Main Characters include:

Richie, the leader of the Wanderers
Joey, Richie's best friend
Perry, the new kid from New Jersey
Despie, Richie's girl
Terror, leader of the Baldies
Emilio, Joey's father
Nina, the new love interest of Richie, played by Karen Allen (Indiana Jones)

The film revolves around the Wanderers, who get into a scrap with the Baldies. After being cornered, Perry, the new Italian kid from Trenton, New Jersey comes in to help because he hates big kids picking on little kids. He quickly becomes part of the group.

During brotherhood week at school, the Dell Bombers get into it with the Wanderers and agree to a football game for pride. Richie is quickly taught that nothing good comes out of fighting for pride, but instead for money, so wages are placed on the game.

Along the way, Richie falls for Nina who Joey likes, and their friendship becomes strained. Ritchie gets Despie pregnant and now has to marry her while Nina fades away into the new wave era of the late 60's with Bob Dylan.

The Ducky Boys are the toughest and biggest gang around, and they get involved in an all out gang fight against The Wongs, Dell Bombers and Wanderers. After the fight, Perry and Joey leave for California and Richie stays behind to marry Despie, all the meanwhile realizing that times are changing and after graduation.

301504,5,6300271706,"A movie set in the early '60's with everything that applies - the assasination of JFK, the shadow of Vietnam, the evolving Civil Rights movement, the great exodis to the West Coast, and the coming-of-age and breaking up of old ties in the face of high school graduation or dropping-out. I have not read the book by Richard Price and I don't know why he decided to set it in the time period that he has unless it's to use the Kennedy thing as symbolic of the passing of innocence (as if it hasn't been overused as such already).

Basically it's the story of several working class ethnic teenage gangs and one in particular, the Italian-based Wanderers, lead by the charismatic and generaly level-headed Ritchie (Ken Wahl, WISEGUY). Their nearest competitors for control of turf are the Baldies, led by a huge, seemingly good-natured monstrosity called Terror (Erland van Lidth de Jeude) and his tiny-but-tough girlfriend Peewee (Linda Manz, DAYS OF HEAVEN)  Other gangs include the Asian Wongs and the Black Del bombers (The DB's).  But all these groups fade into insignificance in the face of the large and vicious Ducky Boys, a silly name for a malevolent, almost demonic gang that seems to perpetually carry its own fog and avant-garde music along with it.

A different threat to Ritchie's world comes in the person of Nina (Karen Allen), an independent spirit who comes from a far greater world than the Bronx. She has greater intellectual interests, such as playing classical music on her car radio, listening to Bob Dylan singing ""Blowin' In The Wind"", and reading ""Lady Chaterley's Lover"" for its literary merits while guessing rightly that Ritchie has read it for the dirty parts.  All of this is far removed from the world Ritchie knows, but Ritchie is drawn to her because he senses she is part of a different world, largely because she is not as shallow as his other friends are, like his regular girlfriend Despie (Toni Kalem).

This is a wonderfully funny movie with snappy dialogue, a few good one-liners (Terror: ""Now, there you go again: hurtin' our feelin's."") and numerous awkward situations for our heroes.  Gang violence as we know it is fairly minimul. There are a few tragic undertones such as when one Wanderers' member, Turkey, decides he now wants to join the Baldies (This makes him an outsider who is later killed by the Ducky Boys).  Richtie encounters a group of people watching the JFK assasination in a TV store and crying.  But some of the funny moments include an encounter between Ritchie and his pal Joey and the Baldies (I won't tell what that eventually involved), how a few Mob bosses cool down some uncooperative gang members in a bowling alley, and the Baldies getting drunk and winding up enlisting in the Marines (Even this has its tragic undertones: Vietnam is just on the horizon).  Things climax when a football game between the Wanderers and the DBs is interrupted by a mass invasion of the Ducky Boys and all gangs bury their differences, beat back the invaders and later reunite at a party to mark Ritchie's upcoming marriage to Despie.

I place this film among those that I will watch when I'm just absolutely stuck as to what I want to see on the tube.

Don't forget to listen in on director Philip Kaufman's commentary track, which is entertaining as well as informative.",1263254400,4,3321,4.786713286713287
301505,5,6300271706,"Music, direction, relationships, friendships, high-school, sex, peers, etc., THE WANDERERS has it all. So when it came to our town in the early 80's, it struck a chord with a few pals for the way it portrayed a group of friends who hung together thru thick and thin while growing up together. We related.

So much so that a frame was clipped from the film and sent to a jacket company on the Left Coast and 18 of us got Wanderers jackets, just like the ones in the film. The day they came in we opened the box outside the theatre, put them on in admiration and went in and saw the film once again. (I've seen it probably 75 times now.) Sometime in the mid-90's we were paid a visit by Rose and Phil Kaufman (Mom and Pop to us), who posed for pictures with the 10 or so Telluride Wanderers still in town.

I must say that the film has held up better than many of the jackets, some threadbare and some stretching to fit older and larger bodies. The film still says what it did when I first saw it, i.e., that friendship is important and can get you thru tough times, that honor is important, and that even though you move on in life, the soundtrack of your younger life can be taken with you as you grow up.",1258502400,,1205,4.167381974248927

Ken Wahl and Karen Allen lead along with a terrific Linda Mans ( Days of Heaven). And because it just wouldn't be a Phil Kaufman film without a metaphysical layer, there is the unexplained presence of the Ducky Boys,  whirling dervishes of ultra violence that might not even be real.

301520,5,6300271706,"Set in the Bronx in 1963, The Wanderers focuses on the life of several young gang members coming of age. On it's surface The Wanderers may seem like nothing more than a sytlish little ditty. But watch closely and you'll find this movie is an existential masterpiece.

Ken Wahl plays Richie, the handsome and charismatic leader of The Wanderers gang. Ken juggles his friendships, loyalties, girlfriends, and struggles to maintain his Italian gang's position in the neighborhood. The Wanderers face threats from The Wongs (the Chinese gang), The Baldies (the greaser gang), an Irish gang and a black gang. But while all these gangs fight eachother, they fail to recognize the real threats to their ethnic enclave are the end of the decade and existential angst.

Always on the edge of this movie is the threat of the Duckie Boys gang. The movie never identifies the ethnic identity of the Duckie Boys. Instead the viewer experiences them as a silent and secret hoard of white men emerging from the fog with calm, placid and psychotic smiles on their faces. The Duckie Boys seem to number in the hundreds-a creepy mass of nameless individuals. In a pivitol scene, The Wanderers and the Blacks have gathered at a football field for a throwdown-they see the enemy in eachother. But on the edge of the field the Ducky Boys quietly gather, waiting to strike. Black, Italian and Chinese band together to fight this hoard of angry and psychotic white men which seem to represent urban America-the America that threatens to swallow them all, force them to assimilate and leave behind their ethnic identities.

The threat of the end of an era is cleverly disguised in Nina (Karen Allen), a hip and beautiful hippie chick. Richie is enthralled with her, but is bound to his Italian girlfriend. He feels Nina's pull and in a climatic scene they end up in the back of Richie's car and then are discovered. Ultimately Richie returns to his girlfriend and is forced to marry her. But Nina never really leaves his mind. We see Richie at his bachelor party and he glimpses Nina on the street. He follows her to a club where Bob Dylan (the real Bob Dylan according to the movie credits) is playing ""The Times They Are A Changing"". Richie doesn't go in to talk to her, returns to the bachelor party and is swallowed up by the Italians.  Indications are he is going to be a ""made man"", married to the daughter of a mafioso but their way of life is ending. The 1970's are approaching. Nina will no doubt go on to be a hip east villager and Richie will settle into the role he is forced to play by life's circumstances, never entering modern society. We are left feeling like Richie's generation will be the last of it's kind.

This movie achieves violence without being violent. Viewers taste threat and never quite know where it is coming from. The characters and acting in this movie are superb. The plot is subtle and unique. It isn't your modern gang movie where drugs and guns and violence are the fireworks of an otherwise extremely dull movie.",1171584000,4,3028,4.684210526315789

They fought mostly among other gang and hung out for fun. But it did get nasty between the Italians and the Blacks (the Del Bombers). And the Ducky Boys are pretty frightening. The Fordham Baldies look scary but their antics gave me a lot of laughs. I recommend this film even if you don't remember the early '60s. It's fast paced in general. This movie is pretty good fun. Half comedy and half drama. It has a great soundtrack if you like music from this era.,1154995200,,620,4.447368421052632
301525,5,6300271706,"I love this movie.
It's one of the most honest ever made, even though it is a movie greatly inspired by nostalgia.
It has no particular agenda or view point, just a tremendous amount of warmth.

That warmth allows it to show urban street kid violence and racism, mafia brutality, and a host of poverty related social ills in a believable way, while still keeping the viewer sympathetic to almost every character and social group involved.
It does not do this by romanticising, it does this by keeping characters human.

There is one exception to this and that is the portrayal of the Ducky Boys - kids from a rival neighbourhood.
In sharp contrast to the other themes of rivalry in the movie, the Ducky Boys are shown to have no humanity at all and are one dimensional villians to such an extreme that it becomes surreal.
This is very deliberate.
Music, lighting and camera work all add to the nightmare quality the movie takes on every time these youths make an appearance.

Many people have a problem with this and see it as unrealistic and a weakness. I do not however.

As I said the movie is very much a work of nostalgia, honest though it is.
As such it has a general sense of heightened reality.
The movie shows the Ducky Boys as the protagonists perceived them.
The culmination of fear, ignorance and the real danger they represent makes them seem a shadowy nightmare enemy to the main characters.

I remember feeling the same way about some rival neigbourhoods during my own youth.
Boys that lived close enough so that conflict would occur from time to time, but far enough away so that there was absolutely no familiarity.
When you get older you realise that kids from one poor neigbourhood are pretty much like another.
When you are young however, though the dangers are in fact real, your sense of those dangers can be exaggerated to the point that other neighbourhoods seem forbidden and populated by inhuman murderers.

So for me the Ducky Boys are in fact one of the strongest elements of the Wanders.

I recommend this movie highly.",1145836800,8,2048,4.640883977900552
301526,5,6300271706,"The Wanderers came out in 1979, which was actually an amazing year for movies.  Among the movies I have for that year in my collection are, Alien, the In Laws, Ten, North Dallas Forty, Breaking Away and of course, the reason the Wanderers was overlooked, the Warriors.  Like the Wanderers, the Warriors was a gang movie set in New York, and both movies had their share of gang violence, but although both the Wanderers and Warriors share similar colors, there's where the similarity ends.

The Wanderers is a much deeper, much more fulfilling movie than the Warriors.  The Warriors was the more violent movie, set more in contemporary times, while the Wanderers was set in 1963, when gangs were more like clubs than criminal enterprises.  The Wanderers share their school with a myriad of gangs the Del Bombers, the Mau Maus, the Wongs, etc.  And when they fight it's without guns or knives.

The Wanderers is a movie about the loss of innocence and the changing of the times, reflective of the period surrounding the Kennedy assasination.  At the end of the movie Joey and Perry leave Richie's bachelor party and head to California, Richie himself goes for a breath of freah air and sees Bob Dylan playing folk music in a bar.  Richie's fiance's father gives Richie an Hawiian shirt emblematic of his new membership with the ""Sportsmen"".  The Fordham Baldies get drunk and get mass-recruited into the Marines.  Everyone goes their seperate ways, each condemned in a way to a future they made with their choices.

The Wanderers is a fantastic movie, and not the least of it is the soundtrack, which is filled with great period songs including the eponymous The Wanderer by Dion which is obviously the gang's anthem.  But the songs aren't forced on the movie, nor is the movie forced on the songs.  They fit each other perfectly, like they were made for each other.

And that's the Wanderers in a nutshell, nothing over done, nothing under-treated, just a well-crafted masterpiece of a movie, where everything fits.",1137628800,7,2014,4.830903790087463
301527,5,6300271706,"The Wanderers is many things...an urban gang drama, juvenile comedy, changing of the times study and more.  It works on all these levels and has become a certified cult classic.  At it's core, the Wanderers is about the final death of the innocence of the 1950's.  The Wanderers are an Italian gang in NY, still clinging to the last vestiges of the 1950's with their matching satin jackets and grease-backed hair.  Early on several members run afoul of another gang, the notorious 'Baldies'.  The Wanderers find themselves trapped until a newcomer, the huge Perry saves them and is immediately welcomed into the gang by their leader Richie (Ken Wahl).

The various members of the Wanderers have problems to deal with on their own.  Richie has gotten his girlfriend, Despie, pregnant, Perry's mother is an Alcoholic, Turkey wants to join the Baldies and Joey has an abusive father who thinks his son doesn't measure up.  The Wanderers have a verbal war with  a black gang, the Del Bombers, in school and decide to settle things with an old-fashioned rumble.

When the Wanderers cannot get any other gangs to back them up, Despies father (Dolph Sweet) a neighborhood mob boss steps in and decides to stop the rumble and have the gangs settle their differences with a football game instead...with a lot of mob money riding on the outcome.  The game climaxes when the two gangs, along with the rest in attendance, must join together to fight ""The Ducky Boys"", a group of vicious, seemingly homosexuals, who have crashed the game with hundreds of members.

Mixed in with the drama and action is a liberal amount of juvenile buddy comedy as the Wanderers 'accidently' bumb into women on the street in order to touch their breasts.  This is how the meet Nina (karen Allen) a bohemian girl who Richie becomes infatuated with.  There there are drunken parties, games of strip poker, etc.  In one memorable scene, the drunken Baldies join the marines.

Through all of this is the theme of the changing of the times.  The doo-wop of the 1950's is now being replaced by folk music.  A poignant scene has Richie following Nina until she enters a club where (in sound anyway) Bob Dylan is playing.  Richie doesn't enter as he seems to know that it's just not his world.  The film also covers the assasination of John Kennedy as the symbolic death of innocence.  It is this moment the galvanizes the strained relationship between Despie and Richie.

One wishes that the Ducky Boys had been better explained.  They are a creepy group of men..older than the other gangs...who never speak and were actually seen taking Holy Communion in one part where Turkey enters their turf by mistake and his killed.  What were the Ducky Boys representing?  It's the one mystery of the film.

The Wanderers has a fantastic soundtrack of early 1960's hits including ""Soldier Boy"", ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Runaround Sue"", ""Shout"", ""Big Girls don't Cry"" and of course the title track.

This is a movie that holds up still after 25 years because it works well on so many different levels.  This was mostly a cast of unknowns with Karen Allen perhaps being the most notable star a year after she did 'Animal House'.  An enjoyable movie from beginning to end.",1109548800,74,3218,4.768535262206148
301528,4,6300271706,"""The Wanderers"" is an entertaining nostalgia piece about the exploits of a group of Italian-American teenage gangmembers who engage in various turf wars with other gangs of varied ethnic types.  The film contains many amusing vignettes and I highly recommend it.  That said, the film definitely is aiming to comment on more serious issues and it is there that it falls short.  It is the very stylishness that director Philip Kaufman employs that undermines this goal.  The social upheavals of the time are treated perfunctorily so they have no real resonance.  The soundtrack, though appropriate(Dion and the Belmonts, The Four Seasons) comes off as somewhat hollow.  I kept thinking that if Martin Scorsese, who later collaborated with writer Richard Price, author of the film's source novel, had directed this film it would be a completely different animal.  If your looking for a better film that deals with the social upheaval that occured in the Bronx at approximately this period of time a better film would be ""A Bronx Tale"", the only feature to be helmed by Robert DeNiro.",1106524800,6,1080,5.033707865168539
301529,5,6300271706,"This is a movie that will stay in my mind at least for a long time. The rhythm, the soundtrack, the different aspects of the plot, the photography, every detail was perfect.

You don't have to be a baby boomer or be from the Bronx to like this movie. Im a generation X guy, never lived in the Bronx and this has become to be one of my favorite movies.

The atmosphere of the movie is a blue collar neighborhood, nothing spectacular brights there, but the mentality, romanticism and values of that time represented in this movie, made this look like this as a perfect era. It also made me understand the nostalgy of the baby boomers.

The final scene, (dont read this if you haven't seen the movie), where Joey and Perry left New York,in my opinion represents the exodus of the people that lived in the inner city toward the suburbs or the new promising west states. A symbol of this phenomenum was,the traumatic for many, departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers to the new great city in that time, Los Angeles.

There are other parts of the movie that deserves an anthropological and sociological analysis.

This film is a timeless jewel, I think I was lucky the day I saw this on cable for the first time. Before watching this, I never imagined this movie could be that great. And definitively, the box office and the critics never made justice to this film. This was the perfect closer for perhaps the greatest decade of cinema.",1099872000,18,1424,4.525291828793774

I think it was one of those rare cases of a brilliantly shot film that can only be appreciated in it's true theatrical format. PAN AND SCAN really took away from this film.
This film really deserves a hell of a lot more attention and respect.",1089504000,4,794,4.189542483660131

because it starred  a  guy i went to high school with
ken wahl.
this historical aspect on what gang life may have been like
in 1963,  sorta a serious  west side storey.
i also boight the soundtrack album  and now have it
on  cd as well.

good movie for a saturday afternoon",1081209600,4,329,4.111111111111111
301543,5,6300271706,"i saw the wanderers at an old theatre in my hometown in 1979, 5 years after reading richard price's book version and i thought it was one of the best movies ide seen since'the lords of flatbush' 5 years earlier.
though not following the book version to closely,it still brought the book to vibrant life with all its stunning characters and violent yet heart felt situations.
'the wanderers' leader ritchie gennaro,best buddy joey capra,fellow wanderer buddy borsalino & hulking new wanderer perry lagaudia,played with crotch tugging zest by ken wahl,john friedrich,jim youngs and tony ganios respectively are excellent.
while there girlfriends,despie galasso & nina becker,played seductively by toni kalem and karen allen,are completely beautiful,while the tiny pee-wee,played with swaggering street smarts by linda manz,as the fordham baldies resident deb,is fantastic.
the gangs,'the wanderers','the fordham baldies','the wongs','the del bombers','the ducky boys',look great in their various gang regalia,from the wanderers gold satin jackets,to the fordham baldies obvious baldness,to the ducky boys sawed off runt look of grey and dirty clothes,they loook authentic as well as luridly dreamlike.
erland van lidthe dejaude,as terror the oversized leader of the fordham baldies is a standout and let us not forget alan rosenberg as the sicophant like turkey zukinni who ditched the wanderers for the fordham baldies ans screwed over his friends,is also amazing.
ken wahl shows a 50's teen idol appeal,while tony ganios does a fair stallonne rip-off as the ape with a heart of gold perry and toni kalem as despie the mob boss daughter puts in a stunning performence.
the opening sequence of the baldies chasing the wanderers through the back alleys of the south bronx,where there finally stomped royally and single handedly by the gigantic dimwitted robin hood like perry,is by far one of my favorites.
the soundtrack oozes cool and its a movie for anyone who recalls the good old days of tight chino slacks,greasey pompadores,girls wearing nylon hose w/t garters,push-up bras,black leather jackets,slick d.a's,do-wop,dion,big finned cars,bee-hive hair do's,cruizin' chicks,gang rumbles,turned up collars, they should definately enjoy this truelly wonderful movie.
enjoy fellow greasers,its a gassss!!!!",1072051200,3,2304,5.681159420289855
301544,5,6300271706,"A cult classic from the minute it hit cable, the music soundtrack came out amidst the New Wave music domination of 1979 and was promptly ignored. But the cream always rises to the top and this soundtrack is simply superb. This is a movie steeped in urban New York mythology.
Not to be missed. The movie could double as a Sociology class on the immigrant New York experience as we watch the Irish, Italian, Polish, Black and Chinese youth struggle over their piece of the turf in the Bronx of 1963.
The movie works on multiple levels -- unearthing a tender love and care for the Italian youth who comprise the gang of the Wanderers.",1060560000,10,631,4.495652173913044
301545,4,6300271706,"The past is inaccessible to us. It cannot be relived. A very few films are able to catch the feel of a time lost to us. This is one of them. It was made in the late '70's about the early '60's. The music helps drive the effect home that we are glimpsing the era as no early ""60's style film could have shown us. Its a bittersweet romp about a Brooklyn gang-kind of a Junior Achievers Mafia. Nice little things like how Kennedy's assasination is experienced and the Bob Dylan ""cameo"" show the creators knew of what they spoke. The Ducky Boys final episode is masterfully spooky and still gives me chills. Too bad Ken Wahl pretty much disappeared after reaching the top in Wiseguy. If you lived in the '60's I think you will enjoy this nostalgic film.",1056412800,,749,4.357142857142857
301546,4,6300271706,"Happy this film is finally available on DVD, as it's one of my favorite films! It was really great to watch the film with the direcor (Kaufman) commenting scene by scene. My only complaints are the lousy, bottom of the barrel packaging, no additional footage, and no comments whatsoever from any cast members. Having said that, I'm still very happy to add The Wanderers to my collection.",1046390400,,387,4.791044776119403
301547,4,6300271706,"They call them the Wanderers! A movie I remember watching as a youngster...thinking these guys were the toughest dudes around. Well, I finally checked it out again and again I was entertained. A solid coming of age gang related movie that takes place in the Bronx '63.
The various gangs are what makes this movie very funny and distinctive. The Wongs, Baldies, and the Ducky Boys are all classics. The moviies climax is the battle in the football field...very memorable.
The ending is quite moving and positve...the future seems unclear, but not cloudy.
Good flick!",1042761600,2,565,4.957894736842105
301548,4,6300271706,"These were the OLDEST''TEENAGERS''since the Sweathogs! I  mean,not one looked at least 18. That said,this is a wanderfull movie. The music,the acting,the chemistry,the atmosphere,everything worked.it had drama,comedy,horror(enter Ducky's Boys),action,and a love story(even though Terror's a lil too old for her!)The plot is basic gang rivalry set in the age of the do wop. We are introduced to the core members of a local gang,the Wanderers. Not a drug dealing,neighborhood wrecking gang. But the loveable,wiseguys you find bowling and hanging out. Tension mounts between rival gang the Del Bombers and the battle is set. Calmer heads prevail and the fight turns into a football game,which turns into a bonding inspired fight. There are subplots;1 Wanderer stealing anothers girlfriend,1 Wanderer becoming a traitor,the home lives of 2 Wanderers,to keep the pacing just right. I am glad to see this on DVD.Too bad theres no extras. Anyway,theres no question youll enjoy this movie,but would you ever mess with the Wongs?",1031875200,6,1020,5.496815286624204

301550,4,6300271706,"Great film of the late 70's.  Ken Wahl did a excellent job as Richie, a Italian gang member in the early 60's dealing with friendship, race and poverty in the Bronx.  Shows in great depth of how people of different origins were looked upon in the early 60's.  What I liked most about the film is how they were able to overcome their differences to celebrate Richie's marriage and stick together against the Ducky Boys.",1004745600,,418,4.546666666666667
301551,5,6300271706,"""The Wanderers"" is a class act and a stylish movie that has a brassy toughness to it that is both infectious and moving. It was probably overshadowed on it's release by the other gang movie of 1979 ""The Warriors"", but ""The Wanderers"" easily holds an equal footing as an excellent period piece of working class lives in 1963. The film centres around the lives of a gang of young boys in the Bronx in mid 1963 coming to terms with friendships, school, girls and other gangs.  Ken Wahl ( a promising actor who for some reason never quite made it to the big time !! ) plays a great lead as the smooth talking and charismatic, Richie, the leader of the Wanderers. Richie is struggling to maintain his gangs strength and position in the local neighbourhood as well as juggling his many relationships with different girlfriends. He meets a young and attractive Karen Allen whilst out on the streets with his buddies, and from there another relationship develops. Allen plays her role with style, and even though Allen is not a great beauty, she has that unmistakable feminine charm, especially when that wonderful smile lights up her face.
What makes the movie all the more interesting is the way it goes behind the scenes into the home lives and the hopes, fears and dreams of some of the gang members. We see Joey's artistic talents put down by his fearsome, aggressive father...we see Turkey struggle with his own identity within the different gangs...and we see Richie forced to take responsibility for his actions near the film's conclusion. Backing the movie up, is a dynamite soundtrack containing some top numbers including ""Stand by Me"", ""Runaraound Sue"", ""Soldier Boy"" & of course ""The Wanderer"" !!
A movie that has charm & talent, and stands up to repeated viewings with ease...if you haven't seen it already....catch up with ""The Wanderers"" soon !!",971827200,39,1853,4.808777429467084
