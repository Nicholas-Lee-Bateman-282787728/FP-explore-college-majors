8465789,5,B003XIFHOU,"Must have for any Mock the Week fan.  As with discs #1 and #2, you get an hour long best of reel, but instead of just brief outtakes, you get whole unedited segments.  The remaining three tracks are complete, unedited episodes, typically running around 45 to 55 minutes each.  While it is advertised as ""Too Hot for TV"" and the outtakes can be ribald, the real joy is seeing 3 whole, uncut episodes uncut, including the taping of the promos for the show.",1427932800,,454,4.445783132530121
