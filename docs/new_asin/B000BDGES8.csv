8085574,5,B000BDGES8,"Death Be Not Proud was one of the very best TV movies I ever watched.  Incredibly touching and heart wrenching, it has stayed with me for nearly 40 years.  My heart is saddened at the thought of what all Johnny Gunther might have accomplished ...and astonished at what he was able to accomplish in his short 17 years.  Robbie Benson was phenomenal.  I really wish this was on DVD because I would love to see it again.  I just finished reading the book upon which it is based.  Johnny Gunther was brilliant.  He lived his life heroically.",1451606400,2,537,4.474226804123711

8085576,2,B000BDGES8,I saw this movie when I was a kid and remembered my dad being moved by it.  Things are a lot different when you're older.  I wouldn't recommend this.  It was a bit boring,1359936000,,170,3.9411764705882355
8085577,5,B000BDGES8,I remember watching this movie in my 8th grade English class. It was inconceivable to me as a 13 year old that kids died. At that age you think only old people die. I don't think there was a dry eye in that class room. We read the book first then watched the movie. The movie and book is about John Gunther's son Johnny who struggles with a brain tumor and eventually dies and how he had a positive and cheerful attitude throughout his illness. This is a great movie for kids to see. It was sad but put life in perspective for us. I hope it comes out on DVD so my kids can watch it.,1180915200,20,582,3.982905982905983
