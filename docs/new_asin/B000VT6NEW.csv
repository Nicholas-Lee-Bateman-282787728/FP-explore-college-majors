8219877,3,B000VT6NEW,"Although it's pretty good, they should have done the live (as opposed to studio) arrangements.  Guitar Solo in COTN should be doubled, 1st instrumental in Strutter should be doubled.  There should not have been fade-outs of Deuce and others.  Detroit Rock City should have had the concert style ending.  Another complaint I have is that (although it's how KISS does it) some songs are tuned down 1/2 step while others are at concert pitch.  This creates the hassle of tuning.  Since this is a jam-along, everything could have been recorded at concert pitch and sounded just fine.  Nice job by all the musicians though.",1319500800,,618,4.884615384615385

I got it today and it is great! I am a fan of Kiss for 35 years and have wanted karaoke Kiss for awhile. This sounds good, plays fine, and is lots of fun. The only bad point is it lacks original band music tracks.",1243468800,,408,6.303571428571429
