8110708,5,B000EJ9VP2,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurably powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

After fleeing the mountain, Naraku goes immediately to Kikyo. He wants to test his new power. In the past he was unable to kill her. This time he has no problem doing it. Upon seeing her maimed and falling into the poison river, Inuyasha lashes out, but cannot kill Naraku. Kagome is hurt by seeing Inuyasha's obsession with Kikyo's corpse-like shell. The darkness in her heart grows stronger, and Naraku closes in to take advantage of that.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything.

8110709,5,B000EJ9VP2,"I purchased something, not from amazon. It had episodes 1-144 and the 4 movies  in a bundle. I though ""WOO! I can get them and just buy the rest later!"" So I spend 130 (Thats right, 130!! ^_^ ) On it and it was shipped to me. Every night I watched 3 or 4 episodes, to savor them, and then when I came to these three, you will nevr guess what happened,

THEY WHERE NOT THERE!!! MISSING!! NOT ON THE FLIPPEN DVD!!! This left me handing! These three episodes are the BEST and most CLIMAXED of ALL the episodes! AND I DIDN'T HAVE THEM!! I mas mad.

When I looked on Amazon to see if they had these 3 episodes, at first i did not see them. I nearly had a heart attack thinking they where not here and where not anywhere on DVD. But then I found them, and was happy.

Thank god they come in threes, the exact amount of episodes I was missing! Ironic?

~~~~ anyhoo ~~~~

These episodes are the best ones, they have the most Drama truth telling and most action out of all the the other Inuyasha episodes, personally. They are the MUST have to any Inyasha watcher, weather they worship or just highly enjoy.

This volume, and 49 and above, are going to be bought by me. ^_^ Because I will need them or I will die....just kidding! But I will be sad. :(

Buy this volume of Episodes, its the best!!",1184716800,,1287,4.140562248995984

8110711,5,B000EJ9VP2,"Much anticipated end to a great story arc.  I was one of probably the few people who was upset when Kikyo was killed, but I thought it was a bold and needed addition to the story.  The Band of Seven had some great and memorable characters who also showed some depth. This entire arc showed some true progression of character developement and story.  It was a truly satisfying disc.",1163376000,,381,4.492753623188406

In the meantime, Kagome is captured...again... by Naraku's incarnation and InuYasha has to rescue her...again.",1149811200,3,264,4.888888888888889
