A castle from 1200 years ago is likely to still be around. A lot has changed in the world in 15 years and to make my point, at the end, there are tons of travel ads and one of them is for NY city and it shows the Twin towers standing in all their glory. The copy I got, since it was so old, skipped and tracked alot but was still able to watch it all the way through. The video seems to be put out by a travel agency since there are tons of ads and references to the host airlines etc. If you can get it cheap, it may be ok but don't use this as your primary source for a visit to London for sure.",1262217600,,724,3.738562091503268
