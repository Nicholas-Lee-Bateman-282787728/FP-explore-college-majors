I only wished it be on DVD.  I enjoyed it very much.",1381190400,,124,4.3478260869565215
8192896,4,B000PQLFB2,High on my list of Westerns-to-keep-and-watch.  Seems historically accurate in the main.  Too interesting to worry much about accuracy though.,1372032000,,142,6.05
8192897,3,B000PQLFB2,I purchase this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She wasn't able to find it anywhere else and is a big Val Kilmer fan. It was pretty expensive (even the cheapest I could find was still $12+ w/ shipping). The quality wasn't great either-didn't play that well. She still watched it twice in one day :),1363219200,,305,4.464285714285714
8192898,4,B000PQLFB2,"William Bonney aka Billy The Kid - a much portrayed character right out of the pages of American history. The bad boy we love so much has been the subject of so many great Hollywood films. To mention a few of the best there's ""Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid"" (Kris Kristofferson),""young Guns"" (Emilio Estevez) and 'The Left Handed Gun"" (Paul Newman).So when reviewing this film it's hard not to compare to those but Gore Vidal's ""Billy The Kid"", although not quite the ""A"" films those are, is certainly a film not to be missed by Western lovers, Billy enthusiasts, and fans of Val Kilmer.

Kilmer who probably was around 30 at the time the film was made(1989), and not as seasoned as he is now, plays the teenage Billy with the same gusto he gives to all his real life characters. He becomes the man he is portraying. His takes on Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"" and Doc Holliday"" in ""Tombstone"" are other great examples of how he not only brings the infamous characters to life but takes on the physical attributes as well. He fuses Billy's young innocent prankster side with the dark heart of a desperate man in this take on the time he was on the run and a murdering spree following the Lincoln County Wars.

The story pretty much follows the same line as the above mentioned films, starting from the time he sought revenge for the cold blooded killing of his boss whom he loved and admired, and believes he is doing the right thing in the revenge he seeks(as maybe does the audience as well).

Historically the film is a pretty accurate telling of the events, although there are some minor differences in the way things happened. I happened to drive through New Mexico a few years ago, and after checking out the aliens in Roswell(practically mandatory), I followed Billy's path and stopped at towns that all had Billy stories to tell, all the way to his well protected grave. In Lincoln, I went through the courthouse where he made is infamous escape, killing two lawman, and from the bullet hole still in the wall at the bottom of the stairs, I can say that the scene portrayed in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" was more likely the way it happened. Oh and by the way, I asked the residents of the small town - who make their living educating and giving tours to tourists on the legend - which film they felt best portrayed Billy and the events surrounding Lincoln and they all agreed it was ""Young Guns""- but said the sequel was nothing but a Hollywood fluff. I still like em both.

Kilmer has a great supporting and seasoned cast to help bring the legend to the screen. Rene Auberjunois, Albert Salmi, Michael Parks, Red West and Wilfred Brimley round out the film nicely. It was directed by William Graham and written, of course by Gore Vidal.

I didn't see this film on DVD yet, A real shame, as the film is a keeper, but the VHS is a pretty bad print.
Val Kilmer, Gore Vidal and Billy the Kid make for great Western fare.
