317331,3,6301140842,"For those of you that have seen Ghosthouse on VHS & would like to own it on DVD, The Mom & Pop Video Shop version is surprisingly good quality.  It's full-screen, but it's also very clear & free of glitches.  Now, if you've NEVER seen Ghosthouse, well, I can't really say that it's for everyone, it's a rather cheesy 80's B-movie by Umberto Lenzi directing under another name.  We have a ham radio operator tracking down a call for help to a spooky abandoned house and finding that some other young folks have set up a base of operations there, unaware that 20 years previously all the tenants were mysteriously murdered & their young daughter disappeared.  It all has something to do with a creepy clown doll that has questionable origins, that was given to the little girl....there is a rather incessant little evil nursery rhyme thing going on (and on, and on, and on) that comes off as sort of ""low budget Argento"", because he has had similar (but much better) themes in some of his films.  Anyway, no good can come of all these young folks hanging out at this house because of course, it's quite haunted and almost all who enter there don't exit, at least not on their own.  I guess it's all filmed in Massachussets but it certainly has the Italian ""doesn't make a bit of sense"" thing going on.  I do actually have a soft spot in my heart (or maybe my head) for Italian films of this sort, but as I said, it's not for everyone.  I'd give it 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1354060800,,1471,4.362637362637362

317334,4,6301140842,"this is one of three ghost house movies that lenzi shot.  This is the best by far but they are all good ghost movies. Unless you are a gore hound , this one is just a blast with wicked music behind the story even.  It's a cult classic for good reason, now a movie fans would rate this somewhat lower I am sure but this is b movie greatness from a great director who could make everything from giallos to crime dramas to bad horror but this isn't bad it's cheesy cult fun that is loved all around the world.  A regular critic would say look at the acting , the low budget but miss the wierd fun of it all. So if you love b movie cult classics that are wierdly fun then this one is for you. The dvd looks pretty good too with no extras really but at least we got this one on dvd. The other two are harder to find and I only have one of them on dvdr!

It's a great, but typical haunted house movie, even though not very interesting it was entertaining. The girl wasa very good and creepy addition to the downright eerie backing music/score. I believe the movie was very well done, and the location was right on.

[the bad]

Typically with movies like this, the bad acting is a given-- we have that. We also have almost no blood, and the blood and effects we get were obvious low budget, but alright. The story also kind of drags on a little too long, there were times when I found myself wanting to hit fast forward. The overdubbing wasn't too great either.

[final thoughts]

Umberto Lenzi is not known for making great films, Ghost House is nothing different, but definitely one of his best. This movie is one of my favorites from my youth, and the backing music used to scare the piss out of me.

At any rate, Ghost House holds up with the test of time. It may not be a great movie, but it is not only very watchable, but entertaining with scares",1136246400,7,1012,4.4728260869565215
317336,2,6301140842,"Ghost House has been a hard movie to track down for some time, but if you do make the effort, be prepared for disappointment - the film itself is a bit of a washout. First of all the house is the same one as used in Fulci's ""House by the Cemetery""...if only this movie was as good as that one! The plot sees a bunch of teenagers (two amateur detectives and a band of holidaymakers) investigating an empty house that was once the scene of a gruesome double murder. What follows is a very muddled series of hauntings and more murders, seemingly carried out by the ghost of a little girl and her toy clown. The various deaths and ghostly visions are laughable, including dozens of completely unrelated manifestations such as a ghost dog, the head of a corpse in a washing machine (why??) and a vat of something that looks like porridge under the floor. Most hopeless of all are the scenes in which the actors pretend to be attacked by the evil clown doll (an obvious but lame attempt to rip-off ""Poltergeist""). The murders are fairly gory, but none are particulary convincing, and the acting is nearly all terrible, not helped by the script which just continues to make up excuses for all the characters to keep going back in house to get picked off. Plus the red-herrings that go nowhere (the hitchhiker and the crazy old caretaker), and explanation for the haunting which is pathetic...it seems as though Lenzi knew he wanted a ghostly little girl and a clown doll, and just wrote a story around it. In its favour, the film is well shot, and a few jolts actually do work (the one when the biker girl is washing her face in the sink was fun), but there is zero supense or tension.

As I said, it's not worth the effort. But if you really must see it, there's a great Region 2 DVD release - available from Amazon.co.uk. I have this edition, and its a nice looking remastered print (uncut and widescreen, no less), but even so, there are far better euro-horrors around than this.",1096588800,4,1975,4.486111111111111
317337,5,6301140842,"With the DVD revolution came a rebirth of b-horror, with various companies releasing dozens of special edition versions of out-of-print 80s horror movies at a time.  Unfortunately, some were overlooked, and the long-out-of-print Ghosthouse is among those that haven't been rediscovered.
This film has a little bit of just about everything b-horror...  You have one of the most amusingly absurd plots ever contrived (CB radio nerd picks up scary message from the future, tracks down the signal using 80s home computer technology, then drags his girlfriend there to share his finding with another group of trespassing teens and twenty-somethings...mayhem ensues), a killer clown doll, a murderous ex-psychiatric patient, graveyards, gory deaths, amusing effects that seem to just be there for the sake of it (including a number of glass objects blowing up like balloons and exploding..ooh, scary), an evil little girl, perhaps the best b-horror music theme ever (a cheesy short little loop that sounds like a demonic children's song and plays a part in the plot..and something I'd love to get the license to for use as an intro track to an album by one of my bands..), a weird hitchhiker who shows up at various points in the story...  I could go on, but you get the idea..  And with all this, it still manages to balance the levels of unintentional humor and horror to the point where it's uttertly enjoyable, maybe even at (or..dare I say..surpassing?) the Evil Dead series mark.
Unfortunately, for now you'll only find this gem used on VHS.  It's even hard to come by at rental outlets.  Hopefully one of those companies currently reissuing horror and cult DVDs will eventually unearth this highly entertaining horror film and give it the attention it deserves.",1033257600,12,1762,5.058620689655172

317395,3,6301140842,"I'll admit I got pretty excited when this film first started. Imagine a dark cellar with a freaky little girl and her heart attack inducing clown doll killing her parents and playing a creepy clown music/dialogue at the same time! Sure, you can't really see much of the killing as the damn picture is so DARK, but hey, I still knew what was going on and was all for it. Until....dududum!...Daylight!

 Yes, folks, when the sun came up the credibility went way down. A stereotypical teenager picks up reception on his CB radio of man being killed. Each night for 2 nights in a row the same message comes through, and then the teenager decides to bring along his girlfriend  to an old house he has traced the signal to. Sounds smart to me so far.  Once there they run into three other teenagers (2 alone just wouldn't work in this kind of movie, of course), who obviously are in college studying Partying 101. The most realistic thing for the group to do, naturally, is to temporarily live in the creepy house they believe someone may have been murdered in. Let the good times begin!
The plot holes are so numerous that if you stacked them together, the pile would go through the ceiling. One of the characters comments later in the picture that if the father has never gotten his daughter the doll that this would have been avoided. I guess she's a closet clairvoyant. And of course any logical, detailed reasoning of the 'bad little girl and doll' aren't really brought to life. The teenagers staying in the house at all, and then staying so LONG, could only happen if they really had the IQ of a steak or, naturally, if they were in a horror movie such as this one.

The camerawork needs...well, work, the acting is piss poor, the dialogue laughable and stiff, the plot forced along a string just to unravel semi-cool deaths, the effects are weak, the budget is low, the aim is mindless, and the end result too simple to seriously copulate.

Despite all this, though, this movie really isn't that bad. Sure, the acting is bad, the plot is weak, and...well, I won't go into it all over again, but there's just something watch able about it. Perhaps it's the creepy as hell clown doll, and maybe it's that you have to keep watching the movie in the vain hope that you'll eventually figure out what the little creep is saying/singing in his creepy weird little voice. Or else maybe it's to see an odd fan death, or to see how stupid the plot really can become. Who knows, and, who really cares?

This is one of those bad movies that's fun to enjoy. It's a guilty pleasure, sure, but it's fun times anyway. It was also directed by Umberto Lenzi, who did Cannibal Ferox. Check it out if you're looking for a cheesy treat, but if you want something intelligent, stylish, or that makes sense, stay away. You've been warned.",1379635200,,2817,4.522593320235757
317396,3,6301140842,"Ghosthouse (aka La Casa 3) is a must have. Not because of the acting nor the scariness but because it is the rarest installment in the Italian La Casa series! This series includes Witchery (La Casa 4), Beyond Darkness (La Casa 5) and even the movies The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II are titled La Casa and La Casa II respectively. And yes, it continues further with House II: The Second Story as La Casa 6 and The Horror Show (aka House III) as La Casa 7! Confused yet??

Anyway, Ghosthouse has its moments. Especially the gore effects...and that darned clown doll!! More scenes with that creepy thing would have made a difference! I noticed that at least three actors were very amateur. One reminded me of the famous ""now she's gonna eat me"" bad actor in Troll II. Give me a break!

Regardless, I am pleased to have this film in my video library! That's about all that can be said about this movie. Creepy clown doll; good gore effects; some really bad acting; not scary; a leading lady that can't talk good English (should've dubbed her AND the bad actors!).

7810074,4,6301140842,"Ghosthouse, otherwise known as La Casa 3 in Italy, was directed by Umberto Lenzi but credited to the alias Humphrey Humbert.  It was part of the unofficial series that came after Evil Dead II.  The plot involves the angry ghost of a child who died, locked in a basement, forgotten by all when her parents were murdered upstairs.  As she starved to death, her only company was an evil clown doll.  Twenty years later, a hapless group of radio enthusiasts stumble on the creepy old house and make the mistake of exploring it.  One by one they shuffle off their mortal coil though various means of expiry.  Besides a ghost guard dog, they also have to deal with a crazy caretaker who is a certified lunatic.  The police attribute the latest murders to him and set about tracking him down.  He easily evades them, on foot no less, over great distances, with a limp!

Interesting.  Tepid.  Familiar.  A horror movie completely devoid of horror.  Yes, it does get a bit messy at times, but it wasn't nearly as gruesome as I had hoped.  Just a lot of set pieces strung together in the hope that people might mistake these crazy bits for a plot.
Still, I quite liked it.
