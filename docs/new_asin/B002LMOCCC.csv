3948777,5,B002LMOCCC,"I'm sitting here in perfect awe. It's a minor miracle to be watching these guys jam in the 'bonus' footage, loose as can be and having a blast as they cruise through a rehearsal for the Rockpalast show featured in this remastered DVD. George's hilarious (out)take on 'Willin', though clocking in at less than 2 minutes, is worth the very reasonable price of the disc alone. Kind of surreal to hear him jokingly state, 'I quit' as he sheds his guitar and heads off stage. Especially so since this band in this form wouldn't last much longer. You couldn't tell that the end was near, though, from the amazing performance in this show.

When I was a fan of the original line-up back in the 70s, I never got a chance to see them live. My friends and I wore out vinyl copies of 'Waitin' for Columbus' at about every gathering imaginable but I had never seen the previous edition or bootleg of this show. In short, this DVD is gold if you ever were a fan and didn't get to see the group with LG. Hell, it's great for ANY fan of great rock & roll, period.",1263772800,3,1048,4.292929292929293

This dvd was shot just before the recording of one of the greatest live albums ever, the Feat's Waitin for Columbus, so if you enjoyed (and still enjoy) that record, you'll really enjoy one of the few, if any, good quality audio/video representations of the Feat from that era.

The appearance of Little Feat at the Grugahalle in Essen, Germany, in July of 1977 was unusual in more ways than one:

First there was Peter Ruechel, creator of the Rockpalast (Rock Palace), who was a long time fan of the band. A year earlier he had gone to a Rolling Stones concert in Stuttgart just to see Little Feat, who were the opening act. From then on he worked like crazy to arrange for their appearance at the Rockpalast. It was to happen during the first long RP night, and it was to be broadcast live all over Europe.

Then there were the local TV crews, who got their first experience in filming and broadcasting 3 rock concerts that went on all night long.

Little Feat's music seemed unusual to some, and they were relatively unknown in Europe, although they had reached a high point in their creativity in the USA. They were, and still are today, at their very best during live performances, and members of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin were often found among the concert goers.

Bootlegs, unauthorized live recordings, had flourished for years on the black market. So Little Feat decided to release an official live album, which was recorded in London and Washington, DC during the 7 shows after the historic Rockpalast appearance. The result was ""Waiting for Columbus"", by many fans and critics considered to be the best live rock album of all times, even though it was overdubbed in the studio later.

The Rockpalast concert is pure live Little Feat, as is breathtakingly evident on ""Skin It Back"". Although the VHS version, and later the 2000 DVD version with commentary from keyboardist Bill Payne and guitarist Paul Barrere circulated for years among fans, this new release is the one that really kicks! Both audio and video have been remastered for a listening pleasure beyond comparison.

As a bonus there is the 30 minute sound check from the afternoon of July 23, 1977, a real diamond in the rough with its seven tracks, including ""Rock And Roll Doctor"" which, unfortunately, didn't make it into the recording of the show. These tracks, known only to a few insiders, have been pulled from the holy grail of the Rockpalast to be enjoyed by all like a fine, rare wine.

30 minutes of bonus material might not sound like very much, but 30 minutes is a long time for a sound check. Cameras are everywhere, giving the viewer the feeling of being right there on stage with the band for the first Rockpalast night. It is obvious that the TV crew is testing their limits and that Little Feat themselves are having a great time.

Not a trace of the rumored tension between band members, except for one time during the show when Lowell George left the stage during ""Day At The Dog Races"" to demonstrate that the jazzy instrumental was not exactly his cup of tea.

Unlike the rest of the DVD, the bonus tracks have not been remastered, giving viewers the chance to experience this piece of rock history as it was originally recorded.

Kudos also to the extensive info in the liner notes, which includes a story by Peter Ruechel about his memories of the first Rockpalast night with Little Feat and many previously unpublished photos.

Little Feat ""Skin It Back - Live At Rockpalast"" is not just for die hard Featfans, but also a must-have for all friends of excellent, timeless rock music recorded by a band at the peak of their creativity.",1255305600,124,3503,4.839464882943144

3948799,5,B002LMOCCC,"This is 100% classic Little Feat from the Lowell George era. And what a treat for LF fans who never got the chance to see Lowell perform live!
Given that this performance was originally recorded in for a TV show 1977 and how well it's presented here is an amazing feat of restoration IMHO. I could also say I can't imagine anything like this on American TV back then...more's the pity.
Ok yeah there are subtitles here and there; frankly I don't see that as a negative but more of a plus for folks who are just now discovering Little Feat. Kinda like when Ed Sullivan subtitled the Beatles first perf on his show.
I got to live a magical moment in the '80s. Hubby and I were on a tour and literally rolled into NYC (pre 911) with the skyline in the morning light while listening to that track. I""ve seen LF live several times and even after Lowell passed they have always been hands down one of the BEST live shows. Who needs all the fancy lighting and go-go dancers and yada yada when the musicians kick butt??
For me it's also bittersweet seeing the guys so young; RIP Lowell and Richie. Paul, you've only gotten better. Ditto to Sam and the rest of the fellas.
I think the bonus rehearsal footage is a big plus. It shows musicians who love their craft so much they not only put it ALL on stage during performances but also during sound check/rehearsal.
And if I could be granted a wish from the Little Feat camp...if video exists of Live From Neon Park...put it out for us fans!",1410220800,,1481,4.350180505415162

3948802,5,B002LMOCCC,"Read all the other reviews. They are spot on and I won't  rehash.their points. I've bought this DVD twice. The first one I lent to my guitar teacher, a serious jazz player who was polite about accepting it. At the next lesson he was trying to figure out how to work Little Feat tunes into his sets. It's  about people who are players. All of the players in this performance have personalities and it comes through the music. It's  the best thing I've seen since The Buena Vista Social Club.  Lowell George was gifted and troubled  and both can be seen clearly in this performance. This show is amazing for the interactions as much as the music. There's a lot of subtle interplay going on and I see something new every time I watch it. Players know Lowell. Two fellows were entertaining the crowd at Crested Butts Ski Lodge and i asked if they knew,any Lowell George. ""Of course"", and they busted out with Willin'.

The musicians are all outstanding, and if there was ever a group where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, Little Feat is certainly that band. With all the video shortcomings, this is a must-have for all fans of Little Feat. The audio in ""Waiting for Columbus"" is far better than this concert video.

It isn't bad, but it isn't their best. It all seems a little listless to me. Don't expect to get a video of a performance Waiting for Columbus.

3948814,5,B002LMOCCC,"I have been a Little Feat fan since the early 70's.  I bought all their albums, saw them live at least 3 times and was a huge follower.  I was devastated when I heard the news that day about Lowell George passing away!  I still have their music on vinyl, cd, Ipod and this video brought back so many wonderful memories.  It is excellent quality and the songs are great!  Everyone in the band shines and I get to see some real good closeups of Lowell. He was an amazing singer, songwriter and to me, the best slide guitar player!  I recommend this to anyone who has ever been a fan or to those who would like to find out what they may have missed.",1355097600,,646,4.128
3948815,2,B002LMOCCC,"At first glance I was extremely excited by this dvd. I am a huge fan of the band and jumped at the chance to own one of their live performances on dvd. Not only was the set-list extremely enticing but it was filmed only a few days before one of my favorite albums of all time; Waiting For Columbus. For all these reasons I thought this purchase was a no brainer, that was until I watched it. At times the mix can be way off and Richie's mic way over shadows Lowell's. Unfortunately this is most obvious on Fat Man In the Bathtub, one of Lowell most passionate vocal performances. To add to these maladies, the audio encoded on the dvd can not be played at louder volumes because higher decibel levels are coupled with an extremely annoying and distracting hiss. However the band is still performing at high level of skill, especially Bill Payne's inhuman prowess on the keys. The Tower of Power horn section is absent but that does not take away from the level of musicianship at which the band performs. Despite the demanding presence of the band this dvd plays like a second rate bootleg and is worth nowhere near the price being asked here. Don't be fooled.",1320192000,13,1160,4.476415094339623

Second, the band comments option on the 2000 DVD is not included on this new version.

On the other hand, the bonus rehearsal tracks only available on this new version make it a keeper for hardcore fans.

3948818,5,B002LMOCCC,"Every song here is great and a classic; live, no overdubs, no bs, no glitz, just kickass musicianship, (with pretty good sound quality and camera work throughout).

This concert is of Little Feat at their peak (on their Summer '77 European tour a few weeks before they returned to the States and recorded the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Columbus-Bonus-CD-Dlx/dp/B0000631ED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Columbus (Bonus CD) (Dlx)</a>. So, you get the same great songs, (although not as much music as on the 2 CD version, nor with the killer Tower of Power horn section that played with them in DC), but even better is the chance to see the core band play, and get a glimpse of the 70's rock 'n roll scene (unpretentious yet passionate performances accompanied by dancing cactus stage props....)

Lowell George reminds me a bit of Jack Black (appearance only), looking young and unassuming, yet with a commanding stage presence. Reputed to have had perfect pitch it is great to watch him play the stratospheric crap out of his slide (while doing stuff like adjusting his tuning in mid solo). I know he was the one to die of an overdose, but here he's clearly the leader, and the most level headed looking one in the bunch.

Bill Payne brings that perfect combination of sophisticated jazz and honky-tonk blues to his wide array of keyboards.

Paul Barrere is especially impressive fronting the band, and plays great lead (sometimes also using slide), doing stuff that I used to think was Georges'. It is great to watch them jamming together with dueling leads.

Kenny Gradney is wonderfully animated (like a 70's dancing fool as he bobs and weaves to the beat) yet serenely focused as he lays down the thick yet nimble bass grooves.

Richie Hayward is intense and focused and right there with the others offering great support on drums.

And Sam Clayton (with his beautiful physique) adds tasteful, low-key backing on percussion.

For any Little Feat or classic rock fan this DVD is a no brainer. They just don't make music like this anymore (Little Feat or anyone else).

(The concert footage includes Skin It Back, Fat Man In the Bathtub, Oh Atlanta, Day At The Dog Races, All That You Dream, Old Folk's Boggie, Dixie Chicken, Tripe Face Boogie, Feat's Don't Fail Me Now, Willin' & Rocket In My Pocket, and the bonus rehersal material includes six of these songs plus Rock 'N Roll Doctor which didn't make it onto the main film.)",1297641600,13,2505,5.031400966183575

This is a 1977 show on the German show ""Rockpalast"", & the drawback is that the video quality, as one might expect from a 30-plus-year-old show, is at times blurry.  The sound, however, I found to be surprisingly clear & vibrant (the audio purists will probably be all over me now) & the performances are terrific.  The extended versions of ""Fat Man in the Bathtub"" & the instrumental ""Day at the Dog Races"" (which Lowell sits out) are particular standouts.

There is also some ""bonus footage"" of the band running through some of the material during sound check.  Some of the songs are only partially done, but the run-through of ""Rock 'n' Roll Doctor"" (which is not in the show itself & is one of my favorite songs of all time) is a real treat.  And there's an insert booklet w/some interesting observations about the show & the band.

I took a star off for some of the afore-mentioned video quality, but I'm really not disappointed, because I get to see one of my favorite long-lost rockers (Lowell) & one of my favorite bands from the 70s.",1273363200,4,1271,4.443965517241379

3948829,5,B002LMOCCC,"I'm a long time Feat fan and saw them a bunch of times in DC in 76-77-78 and this dvd with it's remastered video and audio is just liquid gold to me.  Lowell George singing in fine voice and having some fun (see the bonus rehearsal/soundcheck footage!) and all of the band in the groove and laying down some of their best songs with heart & soul.  The audio mix is worth talking about, because it is not the usual Feat mix you might hear - RIchie Hayward is mixed way up in the harmonies adding an urgency and some tenor to the sound.  Sam Clayton does lay down those deep bass parts you know and love and Bill Payne & Paul Barrere show how great they have always been, not only as players, but as singers as well.
It is Lowell George however, who steals this show.  If you liked him, you have to own this.  If you didn't really know who he was, then you need to own this! Can you say slide guitar master? Vocalist with range, soul & passion - this is the video tribute to his live performance skills.

3948831,5,B002LMOCCC,"This was filmed in Essen, Germany for the show Rockpalast, during 1977. It has a total approximate running time of 97 minutes. This concert features gome great guitar work & solos, also at times the band just ""cuts loose"" and JAMS!!!

It features their classic line-up of:
Paul Barr'ere - vocals, guitar
Sam Clayton - Percussion
Lowell George - vocals, guitar
Kenny Gradney - bass
Richard ""Richie"" Hayward - drums, vocals
Bill Payne - keyboards, vocals

I like these bands that have more than one vocalist. These guys were certainly talented, and played very well together in this concert.

The Song Set is:
1. Skin it back
2. Fat Man in the Bathtub
3. Oh, Atlanta
4. Day at the Dog Races
5. All that You Dream
6. Old Folks Boogie
7. Dixie Chicken (A Real Classic, with a great beat!!!)
8. Tripe Face Boogie
9. Feats Don't Fail Me Now
10. Willin'
11. Rocket in my Pocket

Plus, you get bonus material as follows:
Bonus Rehersal Tracks:
1. Old Folk's Boogie

8373189,5,B002LMOCCC,"This video, taken from the German TV show Rockpalast, has come out under different names. This one is a little higher quality than the other one I had at one time, I think that was just called ""Live Rockpalast!"" or something to that sort. This dvd also comes with some rehearsal videos the other didn't have. If you like the ""Waiting For Columbus"" live album, this is the video to love even more, as it's pretty much a warm up concert for the album recordings, the sound is great, and watching them perform them is a real treat.",1466467200,,528,4.3979591836734695
