6821706,5,B00PTUB2TO,I loved the story and the characters! Its great how Keima (Protagonist) got to know each character and develop a good relationship with them! I feel in love with all of the characters! The art style and  animation were BEAUTIFUL! I just really want a season 4!,1426636800,,260,4.531914893617022
6821707,5,B00PTUB2TO,"Was every bit as good as the previous two, and perhaps even a bit better.  Some new girls, new hijinks, and interesting spins on the conquests this time, covering one large arc rather then a series of conquests.  But ultimately, it is supremely satisfying.  A lot more Character development, rather then the barrage of new characters, and we even get to see Keima face the consequences of when the girls remember his conquest of them.

But, this series takes place after the 4 part OVA that is not released until 5 May 2015 and plays of the material inside it..  But the plot points are related well enough that you need not have seen the OVA's to follow and enjoy the story.",1426118400,3,675,4.5
6821708,5,B00PTUB2TO,Great series.  Very funny with an interesting story,1426118400,,51,5.375
6821709,4,B00PTUB2TO,"Keima just wants to play his games and continue being the God of Conquests - however he and his klutzy sidekick Elsa are called to serve once again.  This time he is not looking for just Lost souls, he is looking for six particular souls known as the Jupiter Sisters.  Long ago these ladies ended the ancient war between Heaven and Hell and brought about the current system, but there are those who wish to bring back the ancient ways.  HIs only clue is they are residing in six of his previous conquests  which will be hard as their memories were erased after the kiss, or are they?  Assassins, hunters and divine kisses are in store for you in this story arc of the WORLD GOD ONLY KNOWS.

I watched this on crunchyroll and it is as good as the previous arcs.  While you expect a lot of hijinks and other mishaps to still take place, this one has a more serious tone as the stakes are higher and more intense.  Also you will see a change in Keima this time, as he becomes more of this world than the virtual.  If you enjoyed the last two, you will enjoy this one and hope the final arc comes soon.",1418256000,7,1098,4.215311004784689

8689195,3,B00PTUB2TO,Not a bad movie.,1459468800,,16,3.25
8689196,4,B00PTUB2TO,I love this series great but the big problem is not only does revert back to the ova heavy over the first two episodes there is also two girl story arc which are heavy mentioned but have not actually been not in the anime before so it spoils itself with the retell ing of these two girls which only feature in flashbacks making the very intestering story of the body swap girl and the moon girl episodes seem even more appealing when they actually don't exist which knocks it down the point cuass I've for one don't like reading the whole manga just so I can watch this series with out asking who the hell is she and when did that happen. Other wise it is still filled with laughs even though not as much as the first two series shame really hopefully those episodes will be released later on even know we if to go back and forth a bit,1458518400,,835,4.192546583850931
