I have been trying to buy this movie for years, and was finally able to find a copy here.  It is very beautiful and serene.  I usually describe a movie orally and in detail, so to write about it is difficult for me.  The harp-playing hero wanders through a war-torn land trying to return to his comrades who are in a British POW camp.  On this odyssey, he encounters the dead bodies of many unburied soldiers.  A conversion begins to take place within him, and he is strongly affected by these powerful images.  He begins to travel through Burma burying the dead, and becomes integrated into a Buddhist sect.  By the time he sees his old comrades, he has become too changed to rejoin them.  They, on the other hand, try several methods to convince him to come home with them.  This is a thoughtful film, and I recommend it highly to all ages.",1040083200,20,939,4.375722543352601
546146,5,6303073085,"I watched this movie recently; ny only other viewing was 10 years ago. It's even better than I remember it - passionately sincere and honest, the sort of thing that pacifists like myself can only strive towards from a great distance. After thinking about The Burmese Harp, I went out and made a public Japanese Garden in the village centre, bearing the Japanese symbol for peace. And this was before Sept. 11!! We need the quiet wisdom of Kon Ichikawa more than ever now.",1005868800,5,471,4.619047619047619
546147,5,6303073085,"This is a story of a Japanese soldier 'Mizushima' in a Japanese party in Burma at the end of the World War II. They knew from the British troop that the war had ended just a couple of days ago. They promised that every one of them would go back to Japan alive, for the reconstruction of the nation. Mizushima left the party he belonged to on a mission to persuade another Japanese party that was still fighting in the Triangle Mountain to surrender. He had only 30 minutes to persuade them, but he did not success. As a result, they were attacked by British Military. Only Mizushima survived. Mizushima was rescued by a Burmese priest. He then traveled to the town of Mudon where his party was staying, waiting to go back home. The comrades in his party were waiting for him, with the hope of going back home together. Mizushima, on his way to Mudon, saw lots of dead skeletons sacrificed in the war, and he decided he would have to do something for the dead people. He met his party in Mudon just a few days before leaving for Japan, but he decided to stay in Burma as a Buddhist priest. This movie is abundant with songs and tunes of harp, that may express that what everyone hopes is peace. In fact, I watched this film in Yokohama around 1982 when I used to go to senior high school. It was the most impressive film that I've ever seen. This time I found this video in Amazon.com and got it to watch this impressive movie again. I recommend this film to Japanese people, especially in the younger generation, who have not experienced war. This film really tells us how dreadful war is, and the importance of world peace. Since this video is in NTSC format, it can be viewed by Japanese video players. I would like to recommend this to my British friends also, and I really hope there should be a version in PAL format also.",993254400,8,1827,4.376470588235295

Because of this skill, he is assigned by his own captain and the British army to go inside a mountain fortress and convince another Japanese regiment to lay down their arms.  What happens next plunges his life into an existential crisis.  He sees the opportunity to put an old life behind him and take up a new one that more closely matches his ideals.

546251,5,6303073085,"Kon Ichikawas anti-war film, The Burmese Harp, is basically a twofold film that composes, and delivers, quite the blow emotionally.  It may deal with a specific moment in time (World War II, and more specifically the destruction of Burma), but the message is universal and quite stunning.  It reminded me, in message and tone but not overall composition, of The Cranes are Flying, which is one of my favorite films (and happened to be released the following year).  Here we are introduced to Mizushima, a Japanese soldier sent on a mission of surrender by his commanding officer.  The problem is, the group he is sent to inform of the surrender is having none of it, and because of their refusal their station is attacked and Mizushima is presumed dead.  His former friends and fellow soldiers mourn the loss of their comrade, unaware that he has not only survived but has been so deeply affected by the death seen around him that he has become a roaming monk, determined to bury the bodies of his slain brothers in arms.  Taking on themes like war and religion (through the eyes of a Buddhist), The Burmese Harp is a visually and emotionally captivating film that layers so much in such a small time frame.  While it has a specific message to convey, the film never feels heavy handed, and I commend Ichikawa for keeping his tragic (and semi-hopeful) tale straight, which makes it all the more powerful in the end.",1391990400,,1415,4.704453441295547

546254,5,6303073085,"The Burmese Harp is an anti-war film set in Burma in the summer of 1945. It brings to light the suffering that war causes, and it is seen through the lens of Japan's ultimate defeat in World War II. Horrific suffering is viewed against a backdrop of natural beauty. Ultimately, the audience and the soldier-musician are transformed to a pacifist world view.

I don't have a great love of war films. However, The Burmese Harp was highly recommended, and I found it to be fascinating -- not at all what one would ordinarily expect of this genre.",1377216000,,543,4.597938144329897
546255,5,6303073085,"In this masterful antiwar movie Kon Ichikawa uses the big emotional impact of music and singing. It goes straight to the heart of the spectator.

The soil of Burma is red with blood of fallen Japanese soldiers. Nobody is there to bury their corpses decently, until one soldier, disguised as a Buddhist monk, takes the herculean task on his shoulders.
Kon Ishikawa asks in his movie: `why must the world suffer such misery?'
But, the example of one soldier who survived the onslaught, gives the devastated world a glimmer of hope. Indeed, `our work is simply to ease the great suffering of the world.'

In one of the extras, the actor Rentano Mikuni reveals that bayonet drills in the Japanese army were `performed' on living prisoners of war!
This movie is a real masterpiece. A must see, also the extras.",1374883200,,805,4.742857142857143
546256,5,6303073085,"A moving film about the uselessness of war, as see by the despair of loyal soldiers who are ready to die for no reason, even after their country has surrendered. It is a highly recommended film, a masterpiece of its kind.

One man's personal attachment to his fallen comrades is the pretext to show us how human beings react in the face of  death, defeat, resignation. His harp is the link with his comrades, both fallen and alive, with the country he has fought in, with the local population and, in the end, with his inner self.

The film is a bit too benign on Japanese war atrocities. Yes, this is not its subject, and one can sense in a scene or two that there was hostility by the local population against the Japanese. Yet the film would have been more complete if it had also shown that the dispirited Japanese soldiers in 1945 had been responsible for immense harm to the beautiful country of Burma that is portrayed here. Showing their cruelty would have made their humanity stand out better. (Actually the film was mostly shot in Japan, but no matter.) The old Burmese lady who trades and exchanges gifts with the Japanese soldiers leaves one with the impression that the Japanese occupation was not so bad after all.

The film is shot in B&W, which in my view adds to its dramatic effect by giving a greater impression of decay and doom. As we are told in the commentary included in this disc, the choice of B&W was made by Ishihara after the color technology that was made available to him proved impractical for the kind of shooting over difficult terrain that was required in this film.",1363392000,,1601,4.529411764705882
546257,4,6303073085,"I first saw this film over thirty years ago when it was titled ""Harp of Burma"".  It moved me then and I never forgot it.  When I found a copy in the Public Library, I viewed it again and was moved again and decided I had to own it.  The Japanese were perceived by us as demons. We were considered demons by the Japanese. The film presents a group of Japanese soldiers who were not demonic discovering that the enemy they fought were just ordinary human beings.  Like themselves.

While the acting in a few scenes was a little over the top, many seemed more documentary than dramatic.  An eloquent statement of the brutality and insanity of war.",1363305600,,644,4.415254237288136

546280,5,6303073085,"This is a somewhat challenging movie to review simply because I have never seen anything like it. The Burmese Harp is the most powerful anti-war movie I have ever seen,
While at the same time it is a war story.  The cinematic stereotypes of British and Japanese soldiers just don't fit in this haunting, ethereal story of the end of World War II as it takes place in Burma.

The time is 1945 and we are with the Japanese Imperial army in Burma. The war in the Pacific is being fought fiercely in many islands and countries all over the Pacific.

The Japanese where tasting defeat in many of the dozens of places they had invaded by the time 1945 arrived and the writing was on the wall, but Burma remained an extremely important country to both take an hold, as it is next to India.  India was British as the time. By taking Burma, the British would have the enemy knocking on the door and that enemy would have the whole country next door to stage and prepare for an invasion.
Burma was a hugely important target for the Japanese and it was also a do-or die , must-stop the enemy here destination for Britain.

This Japanese did not successfully conquer Burma. They lost as many as 60,000 men there, dying in the monsoons, the jungles, the mountains and tasting defeat as bitterly as any army dying in a far away land ever has.

Think of that,  sixty-thousand men, dead and lost. The bitterest of defeats for the once all- powerful Imperial Army.
The movie opens in Burma where we encounter a Japanese squad of perhaps 50 men led by an inspiring commander who is a classically trained musician. Because of his training, he has his troops sing occasionally, and they are glad to do it. The very heavy and slow slog of the war, being so far from home, all of the soldiers enjoyed the singing as the only joy they have known for a good long time. One of the soldiers, Muzishima, finds a harp there. He picks it up and finds that he has a natural gift of making beautiful, lilting music to accompany his singing comrades. They are managing about as well as they can in these difficult circumstances.
When we first see this Japanese army squadron , the war has been declared as over for 3 days already, but they don't know it. They do their duty as soldiers while continuing to sing. In a scene appears almost magical , they are taken prisoner by the conquering British. The British treat them well, but they do not know if they will be killed, enslaved, moved to who know where, or have any idea of their fate. They are all good soldiers and face the unknown bravely, and make the most of their peaceful captivity and carry on.

Not far from the camp where they are held, there is a fiercely resistant holdout of a large number of Japanese troops who are firing down from a mountain and harassing the British.
The British ask the Japanese if they would volunteer one of their men to go to the Japanese holdouts and explain that the war was over, please hand over your arms and lets stop this fighting now that the was is over.  Mizushima, the harp player , is chosen and gladly accepts the mission. He wants to save as many of his comrades as he can. Of course the Japanese hold outs not only do not believe him, the call him a coward. Mizushima does his best in the short time the British have ceased shelling the hold outs, but is not successful in convincing his fellow soldiers. The British once again resume the bombardment of the Japanese hold outs, only this time, almost all are dead or gravely wounded, including Mizushima.
Mizushima is now separated from his comrades. They are taken to a larger British camp at Mudon, hundreds of miles away. Mizushima recovers, but just barely. He steals some local clothes and shaves his head and from then on, he is taken by all of the modest Burmese that he meets as being a monk.
( Monks are greatly revered in Burma, "" where the Buddah lives "". )

Mizushima is overwhelmed by the simple graciousness that he encounters from the many Burmese he meets, many of which have nothing in this world except today bowl of porridge , which they happily share and give to this stranger.

We see Muzishima change. He affects the clothes of a monk, he encounters nothing but kindness from all of the local population as he attempts to get back to his squad who is now imprisoned at Mudon. He finally makes it to Mudon, then turns back. His comrade see him, they shout ( they had all taken him from long-dead ! ) and beckon him to join from the other side of the barbed wire fence. For some reason, he declines and heads back into the jungle, while noting that the British are treating the Japanese quite well and humanely, much to his surprise.

Thru a third party, the commander of the Japanese men receives a letter from Muzishima.
All of his comrades want to know what is in it, the commander decides not to open it from now.  They are confused and dumbfounded, how could their friend and comrade not want to join his old outfit ? What is he doing that is so important ?

The Japanese are finally repatriated back to Japan. They are returning to Japan on a freighter. The war is lost, they know that they will be returning to a very defeated, starving Japan, but are anxious to get back home and to make Japan a better country when they do. It is a sad and melancholy scene on the ship back home. At this point, the commander pulls out the letter from Muzishima and reads it to the men.
Muzishima had encountered so many thousands of dead Japanese as he traveled Burma.
He has decided to return to Japan, someday. However he is going to stay in Burma to bury the bones of the many thousand of his comrades so they can at last rest in peace in this country so far from their homes. The men understand, it is a very difficult decision, but it is the right thing to do.

I have seen just about every war movie made. The Burmese Harp is the only war movie that I would call tender. It is haunting. It is reflective. It is redeeming.
And it should be seen by a lot more people. I recommend it highly.

Note- Kon Ichikawa is one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, he also directed "" Tokyo Olympiad, Fires on the Plain, and Alone in the Pacific, among many others.
This movie is  part of the Criterion Collection of fine films.",1352592000,6,6269,4.381239242685026
546281,5,6303073085,"Ignore the negative reviews.  Japan moved very quickly away from the ultra-nationalist, fascist regime towards a more peaceful country with serious anti-war sentiments.  Their constitution forbids the invasion of another country.  But I won't get into a political debate.  This film was made 11 years after the end of World War 2, and Japan was still recovering.  This film does tend to gloss over the atrocities by the Japanese, but essentially the film is not about that.

The film begins with the end of the war.  The Japanese troops must surrender to the British troops from India.  Mizushima's unit surrenders, but he is tasked with locating a dug in Japanese unit and convincing them to accept the surrender and cease fighting.  Mizushima locates the unit and is given a deadline, which passes.  All of the troops are killed when the British shell the cave they are holed up in.  Mizushima alone survives.  He then finds a Buddhist robe and travels in disguise, looking for his unit's POW camp.

What makes the film so amazing is that Mizushima starts along a path towards accepting and practicing Buddhism.  He regrets the actions he took in the war, and begins to really see the horrors that were committed on both sides of the conflict.  In one particular scene, he sees corpses left to rot in the sun and after travelling farther cannot get the images from his mind.  Eventually he undertakes his life mission to bury all of the bodies of the war dead he encounters.

There are so many touching scenes in this film.  Kon Ichikawa based the film on a children's novel.  It was his first film showed outside of Japan and was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and if it weren't for this Fellini person and some film called La Strada, he likely would have won.  (For the record, La Strada is amazing and Fellini was one of the true masters).

This film is not trying to overlook the incidents of the war, rather the film is about a man's personal journey to discover his true purpose in life.  It is a film about moving forward despite the past.  Mizushima is not trying to erase the scars of the war, but he is trying to make some atonement.  A marvelous film that was beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, has an amazing score, and is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  The Criterion remastering is amazing and the film is crisp and clear.  A true gem in the wonderful catalog of Japanese films in the 50s.  Highly recommended.",1350604800,,2488,4.6859122401847575
546282,3,6303073085,"THE BURMESE HARP is the story of one man's spiritual journey at the end of hostilities in WWII.  Pvt. Mizushima, part of a captured Japanese unit, is asked by his platoon commander if he will attempt to convince a force of Japanese who have refused to surrender to lay down their arms. He accepts the mission, but he is caught in the final bombardment when the holdout's stronghold is demolished.  Feared dead by his comrades, they wait for him to return as they are moved to a prison camp many miles away, and they eagerly listen for any news of him.  Mizushima, who had previously picked up and taught himself to play a lutelike instrument called the burmese harp, and who is often teased by his fellows as resembling the Burmese natives, awakens after the attack to find he is the only survivor.  As he dons a monk's robe as camouflage while he makes his way over the hundreds of miles to where his fellows are waiting for him, he undergoes an intense spiritual change as he sees the rotting corpses of innumerable dead soldiers across the countryside.  Torn between a desire to rejoin his brothers-in-arms, yet plagued with a sense of duty toward his country's unburied dead, he ultimately must choose between the homecoming he's dreamed of and a higher calling.

I first saw THE BURMESE HARP several years ago, and I remember then feeling quite affected by its quiet, almost naive message.  Now, as I watch it again, I'm of two minds - part of me still appreciates the sentiment behind the film, yet another part feels as though it is entirely too idealistic to effectively make its points.  In the world of the film, all of Pvt. Mizushima's fellow soldiers are decent chaps, who, although disillusioned by defeat, are preparing themselves for the new work ahead of rebuilding Japan.  Their only concerns, their only conflict is waiting to get out of Burma and for Mizushima to rejoin them; Mizushima's moral crossroad is whether to join them or to stay.  Conversely, the Japanese troops who refuse to surrender are almost cartoonish in their fervor to resist unto death.

I'm not saying that this wasn't how it was - I can't know that - but the film very obviously leads its audience toward the emotional catharsis the director aims for.  I suppose all films do to some extent - there's probably no way around it, yet time and distance seem to cast the flaws of THE BURMESE HARP into sharper relief.  With its black or white characterizations, it reminds me of American propaganda films from the previous decade - a simplistic view to better showcase the director's intent.  In this case that happens to be the entirely worthwhile point of view that peace is better than war.  I certainly can't argue with that, and perhaps there should be a lot more propaganda of this sort.

Director Kon Ichikawa is not looking to address any of the ambiguities from the war or of the Japanese actions while waging it - his concern, at least here, a decade after the conflict, is to make a statement that while the rebuilding of Japan could take place on the physical level, spiritually it was encumbant on the people to bury the remains of the war mentality.  Or at least that's what I took away from it.  Yet it is precisely those ambiguities concerning the conduct of the war that kept popping up in my mind as I was watching the film.  I don't know how much psychological depth or moral confusion one should expect from a film of this time, but THE BURMESE HARP has nearly none of either.  It is instead quiet, and uplifting, and simple.  Perhaps that is the perfect delivery system for an uplifting and simple message, but I can't escape the feeling that the world of THE BURMESE HARP bears little resemblence to its contemporary one, which makes it difficult for me to fully empathize with Mizushima's choice.

This Criterion disc is, as usual, visually pleasant, though the extras seem a little bit light.  Two interviews, one with director Kon Ichikawa and one with actor Rentaro Mikuni (both highly recommended for fans of the film), and a trailer are all that are included on the disc.

546283,5,6303073085,"Our lives, all our common lives, are full of events. Each of us is unique, and individual. There are many ways to differentiate each of us, but only a fewer number of ways in which we all merge and become one with all the rest of humanity.

The Harp of Burma is a story about a young Japanese from a time now becoming far in the past. It is a story about a war which is becoming a faded living memory for all but a few. But the inevitable dimming of event does not effect the deeper and more profound qualities of being human, of suffering, and of living our lives in such a way that who we are is brought closer to the basic and eternal awareness that choosing, making choices, living each day, are the lasting things which outlast all the events themselves.

This, film is about a man who is a soldier, making a choice. And the making of this one decision is about Redemption. Choosing Life over Death. Living for a Reason and a Purpose which labors beyond wars, and sufferings and makes of a single simple lifetime...a Bridge linking beauty and suffering with the breathing and enduring of this world.",1308355200,2,1104,4.380487804878049
546284,4,6303073085,"While a bit sentimental, it never veers into mawkishness, and the full five or so minute reading is one of the great humanist documents in cinema, perhaps even greater than Charlie Chaplin's speech at the end of The Great Dictator. Mizushima claims his new mission in life is monkdom, and helping to bury the war dead, and promote peace in the world. The film then makes an interesting decision, and one virtually uncommented on in any of the criticism of it I've read. After the letter is read, the film's narration (which opens the film, and is rather sparse) begins again. All along, viewers have been led to believe- via closeups of the captain's face during other narrations, that it is he who has been telling this film's story from some indefinite time in the future. But, no; the speaker, as the camera move sin, turns out to be a wholly anonymous member of the unit; one who had no prior scenes nor close-ups.

  Imagine, as example, had Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick, not opened with Call me Ishmael, and the reader only found out who the narrator was on the last page, and had to guess if the narrator was omniscient, or a member of the Pequod, only to be startled their guess was wrong. The reason this is so important, looking back at the film, is that a) the point of view change from the expected narrator to another recapitulates the confusion that the troop has over whether or not the monk they see is their comrade- thus letting the viewer `feel' the confusion that the internal characters are feeling- albeit for a different reason, b) it makes the viewer question whether or not what has been shown is true or not, since we now know the narrator is not the reliable and honorable captain- a character we would trust as reliable. This ties the whole film back to the more fairy tale like quality of the source novel. The final reason, c), it forces the viewer to wonder whether or not he or she has assumed other things that were not so in the narrative, even if one accepts that all the anonymous private has revealed is true.

  This is an astonishingly effective device that Ichikawa employs, and coming on the heels of the straightforward and moving missive revelation by Mizushima, the audacity of Ichikawa's narrative sleight of hand erases any doubts over whether this film is great or not. It is as great a film as his later Fires On The Plain, which, narratively and tonally, is almost the complete opposite of this film. But, the fact that such a key element in the film has never been commented upon before shows how little most critics actually pay attention to the subjects they criticize, as well as how little they understand how even a small moment, or the slight use of a technique, can radically change the whole tenor of a work of art. This is too often because the critics approach art with their own biases in tow, rather than viewing the work on its own merits. Another moment that has gone critically unnoticed is the scene on the bridge, between Mizushima (dressed as a monk) and his troop. This occurs two times. The first time, the viewer is as confused as the soldiers are, but the second time, the narrator tells the audience it was definitely Mizushima. Thus, we know that Mizushima's ruse will be found out, and this diverts the narrative tension from will the soldiers learn the truth of Mizushima? to how will they learn it, and will they learn why? This is not an insignificant narrative change of direction, but one, again, which never seems to have stirred critics.

  On a tangent, this film is definitely a political film, in that the politics are put first, ahead of all but the art. Too often, in films like Theo Angelopoulos's The Travelling Players, films that have political content, but content that does not achieve primacy, is labeled political art, when clearly there are other factors that supersede the politics- like psychology, history, culture, etc. Some have, in later years, criticized the film (and Ichikawa's 1985 color remake of it) as whitewashing Japanese atrocities in the war, by showing the Japanese soldiers as song-happy gentlemen, not pillaging, `comfort girl' inducing monsters. But, this misses the point that the first singing session should have drilled home. This film, while political, is not a slice of realism. It has symbolism and allegory throughout. British racism, as example, towards natives and Indians, is never shown, but it existed. Ichikawa's aim was to clearly demonstrate the quest for humanity, embodied in Mizushima, but aimed at the viewers. Also, as the film was made in 1956, the fact is that Ichikawa was likely wholly oblivious to the atrocities his country committed in the war, despite the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. To this day, even, Japan has been very reluctant to acknowledge, much less deal with, its past as an aggressor nation.

  The DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is well transferred- the black and white hues are brilliant. However, the DVD lacks an audio commentary- an increasing annoyance with Criterion releases ever since they went to their new C logo. There are too all too brief interviews with Ichikawa and Renataro Mikuni, who played the captain. There is a trailer, and only subtitles, again in white- another bte noir of Criterion, for white subtitles often are lost against the whites of a black and white film. Colored subtitles are a must if no English dubbed soundtrack is to be added. The insert contains an essay on the film by film critic Tony Rayns, but it's a rather pedestrian take on the subject. Akira Ifukube's score is solid; the only real highlights are the delightful harp playing by Mizushima.

  Overall, The Burmese Harp is a great film. It is not one of those razzle-dazzle works of art that is flashy, but it gets the job done, and invites rewatchings to elicit subtleties one viewing may miss. It also kills the old notion that all war films- even those with explicitly anti-war themes- end up celebrating war because of the battle scenes and those scenes which show individual valor. Both this film and Fires On The Plain kill that notion; the former by eliding almost all scenes of battle, and the latter by the sheer devastation of the results of war it shows. It certainly deserved its nomination for an Academy Award as best Foreign Film, as well as numerous other festival awards. Ichikawa's reputation is that of a serviceable studio director, and that may be true; but the two films of his I've seen are the equals of the best films made by the titanic Japanese triumvirate of Yasujiro Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Here's hoping he has a few more deviations from that norm others claim for him.",1283299200,3,6685,4.745908699397072

The film's anti-war message is obvious, but conveyed progressively. There is no sudden transformation. Instead the slow transformation occurs through the main protagonist's (Mizushima) mental struggle on whether he should return to his army comrades and return to his home country or stay behind and allow the spirits of the Japanese soldiers to ascend.

At first, the audience understands Mazushima's transformation from a Japanese Army soldier into a Burmese monk to be a superficial means of surviving. He acts the part, but he is no monk. He plays the monk to survive the journey to Mudon. But along his journey, he observes the horrors of war. The lifeless bodies of his former Japanese comrades. Their bodies piled on top of another. Ichikawa skilfully shows Mizushima's transformation as he sees the horrors and how Mizushima can no longer bear to see the destruction.

The photography is beautiful. The best I've seen from a film from this decade. Ichikawa does so much, with so little. Every scene has a purpose in the plot. Shots are set up differently. I remarked that I would've loved to have seen the 1985 colour version of this film.

The music is haunting and has purpose in underscoring the destruction we see. But there are uplifting moments. And there are moments where we see camaraderie even among british and japanese soldiers. All these are underscored by the song that is selected. The songs sung by the Japanese soldiers are symbolic and full of purpose towards one of the central themes of this movie. Song serves to unite the soldiers. Many of the songs sung by the Japanese soldiers were the same sung by my father when he was in school.

The ending is indescribably touching. And the parting shot of Mizushima walking the Burmese desert alone will have you at your most vulnerable emotional state as the phrase: ""The soil of Burma is red, and so are its rocks"" rolls by.

This without a doubt, the best film I've seen this year. You probably won't undergo a life-changing decision to devote your life to aid the suffering of others after you see this film, but you'll think long and hard about your existence. your purpose. perhaps most importantly, you'll come away from this film feeling better about yourself. Perhaps it's not so much a war film, as it is a spiritual quest. Such a story could be told through German or Russian eyes as well.

Highly, highly recommended. In my opinion, along with Akira Kurosawa's 'Ikiru' these two are the best Japanese films of the 1950s.

546287,4,6303073085,"I was impressed enough by FIRES ON THE PLAIN that I immediately had the desire to watch this earlier and just-as-celebrated war film, though my local store had no DVD. The old Homevision VHS is a little dark and hazy at times, but serviceable enough, and the film is far more than that. Just as powerful and moving as a denunciation of war, this takes a very different path in showing us that philosophy. Captain Inouye (Rentaro Mikuni) leads a troop of Japanese infantry in the waning days of the war in Burma, keeping their spirits up by engaging them in song as they march dispiritedly through the jungle. Mizushima (Shoji Yasui), a very serious young soldier, has learned to play the Burmese harp very beautifully despite no formal training. They are offered shelter in a Burmese village and are captured by the British, but the war ends and they end up in a prison camp where they are reasonably well treated. Not all Japanese have surrendered though, and there is a tough band occupying a mountain lair that is giving the Brits some trouble; they ask for a volunteer to speak to the holdouts, and Mizushima volunteers. He has little success in persuasion and soon the British are shelling the cave hideout again - before he can escape. Almost killed, he witnesses the destruction of all of those around him. Unconscious for a time, he misses the British and his own men leaving the area and goes to rejoin them, but he is so sickened by the slaughter that something snaps inside him; he takes the robe of a monk, and in the process of burying men and slowly journeying towards his comrades, he takes on the weight of the tragedy, and decides that his destiny is not, in fact, to continue with his men back to Japan, back to the everyday world.

Like FIRES ON THE PLAIN this is brilliantly acted and shot, and very moving. It is not, to my mind, quite as consistent or as powerful; there is just a little too much of the Christlike about Misushima, and his captain seems to function in some ways more as a plot device (the understanding, well-read, philosophizing man who still must do his duty, though his heart belongs with Mizushima in Burma) than a real army officer. Still there is a powerful humanity at work here; I love how the British are presented, for example - just essentially doing their duty, not particularly brutal though quite stern when they need to be - and as with FIRES ON THE PLAIN there is some comic relief, in the form of a parrot, and an old woman who barters with the POWs. The film is perhaps a little naively optimistic, in its assertion of old spiritual values as a potential remedy to man's violence....but this is counterbalanced by the realistic take on the majority of the crew aboard ship as the soldiers head home....the CO reads a letter from Mizushima informing them of why he cannot join them; they are moved and respectful, but moments later many of them are turning their minds to worldly pursuits...Ichikawa knows better than to believe one Mizushima, or one film by him, can change the world. The hope is something, and that is all he and we can do.",1254787200,,3098,4.571942446043166

I was quickly sucked into the story, the visuals, the soundtrack (awesome, haunting), and the characters.

I could not tear myself away from the movie.  Some reviewer complained about the movie being slow...  egad, this is not an action movie, but still it had more going on in it from one scene to the next, because it is so incredibly rich in things other than ""action"" - dialogue, characterizations, symbology, philosophical contrasts, incredibly composed visuals, the aural landscape, etc.  It overflows your senses.  Turn the lights off, so it is just you and the movie, and let it take over.

546320,4,6303073085,"It is August 1945.  Bands of Japanese troops are retreating before the advance of the British Fourteenth Army.  One company of soldiers led by Captain Inouye (Rentaro Mikuni), resting in a Burmese village, realizes it is surrounded.  As the troops scramble to meet the expected attack, they sing folk songs to hide their fear and conceal their preparations from the British and Indian troops.  They are singing ""Home, Sweet Home"" in Japanese, and the enemy sings back in English!  The war has been over for three days, and the unit surrenders with no further loss of life.  This perfect, moving scene begins ""The Burmese Harp.""

One Japanese soldier, Mizushima (Shoji Yasui), is sent by the British to encourage a unit of holdouts to also surrender.  That unit, however, is still in the grip of the bushido code.  They refuse to surrender and are killed by British artillery.  Mizushima survives and wanders through the countryside alone and disoriented.  He encounters Japanese dead at every turn.  Becoming an itinerant Buddhist monk, he takes on a personal mission to find and bury the dead.  Though his former comrades are eager that he rejoin them so that they can return to Japan together, in a moving final scene he refuses so that he may purify his own soul by confronting the horror and suffering of the war.

The choral singing (Captain Inouye had been a music teacher before the war) is moving.  The cast is uniformly strong.  The scenes of Burma and its people are fascinating.  A few now-passe photographic techniques do not diminish the high artistic standard of ""The Burmese Harp.""  Although it is an anti-war movie, it is not heavy-handed.

The film's plot and viewpoint, however, have a glaring weakness, a blind spot that must be noted.  Mizushima grieves for the Japanese dead, but there's no sign that he also regrets what the Japanese Army did in Asia in the years before the plot opens in 1945.  There's no aggression.  No brutality.  No death marches.  No beheading of allied POW's.  No comfort women.  And we never see Mizushima grieve for the allied or Burmese dead.

In this regard, the movie prefigures Japan's postwar failure to face its aggression and war crimes during World War II.  That failure still troubles Japan's relations with China, Korea, and the other nations that experienced Japanese brutality at first hand.  A cultural historian might judge that the omissions in ""The Burmese Harp"" helped shape the dominant postwar narrative, portraying Japan as the victim in the war.  Director Kon Ichikawa sidestepped a true look at the war.

This is indeed a fine movie, well worth seeing for both its artistic and moral content.  The viewer must, however, enlarge its message about war and peace, tragedy and suffering, and atonement.

This is a movie that isn't just well made, but the sentiments are important.  In an interview that is included on the disk, the director says that he felt it was a mission, like a divine imperative, that he make this film.  He answered the ""call"" magnificently and has produced a work of art that will touch hearts for a long time.

The two main actors are wonderful to watch.  They are both physically beautiful and have a simplicity and sincerity that is precious (and rare).

Despite the fact that the story takes place in the midst of human misery, there is the saving grace of beauty, in the splendid devotional art of the Buddhist culture and the music!  The singing of the men, in their deep Japanese voices and the gentle sound of the Burmese harp, are incredible.  (I'm running out of words to express my reactions to this film.)

The plight of the isolated soldier who undergoes a different kind of suffering than his ""brothers"" do is almost exquisitely painful...the decision he faces, to return to everything and everyone he has loved, vs. his perceived duty to bury the dead is really agonizing.  I was voting with the parrot, ""Let's all go home together.""

My only wish is that it could have been made in color.

I found the interviews with the director and one of the stars to be a wonderful extra treat.  They are both in advanced years and show a sweetbess and gentleness that is an extention of the spirit of the film.

I was reminded of another heart felt film, Les Choristes, in which the dismal, painful setting of a French boarding school for delinquents, is transformed by one man who teaches them to sing.  If you like this, check that out!",1189728000,4,1816,4.460606060606061
546322,2,6303073085,"Despite its Buddhist trappings, The Burmese Harp is not a film about Buddhism or religion, but a film about responsibility and atonement to the _Japanese_ war dead.  Director Kon Ichikawa may have wanted to make a film with universal themes, but the message that comes through is for a much narrower audience.

The film tells the story of a Japanese soldier cut off from his unit who has a transformative encounter with death.  Stealing the robes of a monk to disguise himself, Mizushima struggles through a broken landscape to return to his unit, along the way encountering one grisly corpse after another, sometimes piles of them, some being picked apart by carrion eaters.  He tries to bury or cremate those he finds but there are so many he quickly exhausts himself.  Stumbling into town, his life is changed after witnessing a British medical team bury an unknown Japanese soldier, a scene which crystallizes for him his duty to stay in Burma to inter the corpses of Japanese soldiers.

In its broad themes, the film is humanistic and universal.  Love of music and home is shared by all humans.  We all shy from death and suffering.  But look closer and you find that Mizushima sees only Japanese corpses.  His primary motivation for remaining in Burma is to bury _Japanese_ soldiers whose remains might otherwise be thrown into unmarked graves by the British or Burmese.  But what of Burmese corpses?  British corpses?  Not a one to be seen, nor commented on.  To what degree can one atone for participating in war without realizing that all sides suffer, not just your own?

This Criterion release features an interview with Rentaro Mikuni, who plays the unit captain, in which he mentions that he was himself stationed overseas during the war and was made to take bayonet practice on live animals as well as prisoners of war.  Yet nothing like this kind of behavior is ever suggested in the film.  There is no whiff of the brutality visited on the  Burmese by Japan's Imperial Army.  On the contrary, the Japanese soldiers are portrayed as rather happy go lucky lads caught in a bad situation, which pretty much continues to be the national attitude of Japan toward its war time experience.

The Burmese Harp is a hollow piece of work that depicts suffering without addressing the causes of suffering.  For more forthcoming accounts of Japanese experiences of WWII, see Minoru Matsui's ""Japanese Devils.""

546323,5,6303073085,"Ichikawa's absorbing study of soldiers under fire was one of the first films in any country to explore the spiritual impact of war. Heightening the effect, on one hand, is his brilliant use of music, via the transporting strains of Mizushima's harp and the infantrymen's morale-building chorale singing, taught to them by Inouye. But the director also frames indelible images of war's horror, such as one famous image of corpses piled and strewn across a desolate beach. Still, Ichikawa's message is essentially a humanistic one, and ""Harp"" is a tender, often profound meditation on the best and worst aspects of our inner nature.",1182816000,3,630,5.12621359223301
546324,4,6303073085,"The tragedy and the devastation of war has been the theme of many films.

Some of these films were making a simplistic attempt to glorify war and create heroes while some others made a serious attempt to recognize the war as an inevitable part of humanity however inhumane it might be.

Some other films made an effort to condemn war and try to influence the future generations of the importance of reconciliation and the avoidance of such devastating conflicts.

In each and every war film, the directors were always confronted with the dilemma of impartiality while trying to remain close to reality and present a believable story that can keep the audience interested.

Some critics suggest that the Burmese Harp is the most outstanding anti war film ever made.

I will not go to that extend but I can recognize the incredible talent and ability of the director Kon Ichikawa to present a war theme film so early after the Second World War to an audience in Japan freshly dramatized by the highs of Imperial patriotism and aggression, the suffering of the devastation at home and the realization of defeat.

He has chosen the music as the binding force among soldiers who are already at the lowest of their fighting spirit.

This is a story of a company of Japanese soldiers in Burma at the end of the Second World War facing the unavoidable defeat and the necessity to surrender.

Their captain, himself a music teacher, keeps the spirits high through music and singing and demonstrates an incredible humane approach.

One of the soldiers made and learned how to play a Burmese harp.

He is accompanying the chorus when they sing. Once the company surrenders to the British, the harp player, Musashima, undertakes a mission to negotiate the surrender of another company of Japanese soldiers but he fails.

In the aftermath of the battle that follows, he survives but never returns to his former company.

He becomes a Buddhist monk and goes around the war-ravaged country experiencing the misery of war, the devastation and the suffering.

Finally he is coming so close to his former company and yet he cannot return to Japan along with the rest of his fellow soldiers.

His duty as a Buddhist monk was to stay there and try to burry the many Japanese soldiers left in the battlefields.

In an emotional farewell, the monk with the Burmese harp is standing outside the fence of the camp where the rest of the Japanese soldiers are waiting repatriation.

They suddenly recognize him although they were thinking of him as lost in the battle and they sing for him one of the well known songs while he replies with his harp.

He disappears away from the possibility of repatriation to his new role as a monk and as the person to honor the dead soldiers.

""Burmese Harp"" a story of soldier within a unit that during a mission finds himself separated from his regiment. Outside of his system and without  the framework and company of military life, he goes through a spiritual transformation that makes it impossible for him to return to his unit. He finds himself wandering in the war torn wastelands of Burma among field of dead soldiers until through a painful epiphany, he begins to find a path of salvation in burying the dead.

 The music is instrumental ( no pun ) in the telling of this story. The hero is a naturally gifted musician who has taught himself to play the harp. His supporting character ( the captain ) had been a  musician in an academy  before  conscription into the Japanese army. The entire unit has become a choir at the captains coaxing and they sing to sooth the savage demoralization and discomfort of their plight as soldiers in a losing army trudging through Burma at the end of WW2.

Both story and music use themes culled from western classical  mythology in ""Burmese Harp"" chiefly, the myth of Orpheus in the underworld

( the story of the most gifted musician who, likewise, is on a mission in Hades - the land of the dead ).

In fact, during a scene in a repository of the dead within a british army camp, the main theme from  Stravinsky's ballet ""Orpheus"" is smartly lifted and used to brilliant effect by film composer Akira Ifukube.

Kon Ichikawa is as every bit as gifted a filmmaker as Kurasawa or Ozu.

Like Kurasawa ( and unlike Ozu) the continuity, pacing, shooting and editing style are western ( Kon sights frank Capra among his strongest influences ).

By this time, the British troops have the upper hand, and a demoralized Japanese battalion led by the indefatigable Captain Inouye has peacefully surrendered. However, there is a fanatical unit of Japanese soldiers cloistered in a nearby mountain, and Private Mizushima accepts a risky mission to convince them to surrender. He fails valiantly and is left for dead after a hailstorm of gunfire. What happens next is tracked in two intertwining storylines - the first is the spiritual journey of Mizushima as he is traumatically affected by the overwhelming number of casualties he sees on his way back to the prison camp where the rest of his troop has been sent; the second is about Inouye and his men and how they use music to reconcile themselves to defeat and rebuilding their lives after the war.

Considering how graphic many of the images are, it's hard to believe that the screenplay written by Ichikawa's wife Natto Wada was actually based on a young adult novel with an almost fairy tale tone. Yet, some of the more fanciful elements remain in the movie, in particular, the magical affinity that Mizushima shows when he fluently plays a handmade harp and the insistent use of the overly familiar ""Home, Sweet Home"" as a connective plot device between the opposing sides of the war. If one can embrace such contrivances, then the rest of the allegorical movie begins to resonate on a deeper level. What helps immeasurably is Ichikawa's clear-eyed sense of narrative flow as Wada's script reveals the character transformations in human-size terms. The one drawback to this subtle approach is the overly symbolic leap that Mizushima makes from dutiful soldier to pacifist Buddhist monk. It feels far more like the personification of a country's postwar metamorphosis than an honest change in outlook, whereas Inouye's overwhelming feeling of accountability over Mizushima's fate grounds the film in a more certain reality.

The two key performances reflect this divergence - Shoji Yasui is sincere and often powerful but dramatically opaque as Mizushima, while Rentaro Mikuni maintains a forceful presence as Inouye with a prevailing humanity.

All I can say is The Burmese Harp is a damn good film from director Kon Ichikawa a director whose films I've never seen but hope to fix. Its melancholic, beautiful, and truly one of the best war films ever made without all of that fuss people consider great in war movies, mainly overly hyped battle scenes that are meant to distract from cliched plots and what goes for characters.

Thats one of the refreshing things I suppose in the movie. Most movies dealing with the horrors of war seem to focus on mans inhumanity to man with characters who fit into that good and evil state. In Harp the Japanese soldiers surrender without firing a shot. The captain of the platoon works with British soldiers sending a willing soldier to a lone mountain where another group of soldiers is hold against against British forces willing to fight to the last man despite the fact that Japan had already surrendered. Even in these scenes the movie doesn't focus on the fact the evil of the men but the sadness of watching men focused on dying over something that doesn't exist anymore. The soldier, Mizushima is hurt in the ensuing shootout between British and Japanese forces found by a monk. While he's reported dead to his captain dressed in Monks robes Mizushima marches back to his troop, horrified that along the way thousands of dead men lie rotting in the sun. He gets to the prison camp but after witnessing British burying a dead a dead Japanese soldier goes back out into the Burma countryside making it his mission to bury the soldiers.

I didn't mean to give a plot synopsis, and really theres more to the plot than I described. The film is at times delicate with one scene I could describe as heavy handed. The acting is generally good with a standout being Rentaro Mikuni as the captain of the soldiers a man who at first wants to find the missing soldier like his men, but in one instance understands what is happening to the man and gives up trying to find out if he's alive. And the direction and writing is amazing as well.

Criterion does well with the DVD presenting a beautiful transfer. I'm not one who sings the praises of black and white photography but then I find something like this film that blows me away with an amazing use of shadow light in scenes. Its a beautiful film well represented. And also worth noting is Akira Ifukube's magnificent score which is epic and beautiful. I don't know how much he worked with but as music plays large part of the films story with the soldiers being led in songs many times for a variety of reasons there are times where it adds to the story as well as the viewing experience.

One small caveat. I understand from the liner notes that director Ichikawa did a remake using the same script (he even had the same actress that plays an old woman trading with the Japanese soldiers in the prison camp)of the film in 1985. Sure it would have made the disc more expensive, but as Criterion has put out discs featuring two versions of the same story (Floating Weeds/The Lower Depths) it would have been interesting to see this film provided. Sure it would probably be a lesser work compared to the original but I'm interested in seeing how the same director redoes his own masterpiece.",1174262400,23,3310,4.5673400673400675

He recalls the hundreds of dead and unburied Japanese soldiers he had seen in his journey, he becomes a true Buddhist monk, and makes a singular and difficult vow; he will not return to Japan until he has buried all of the corpses he had seen. So he goes back, and begins his work.

Hardly blissful meditation, this. But he personifies what the Buddha taught; the purpose of Life is to be happy, but true happiness can only come from serving others. This soldier/monk, in devoting his life to active, difficult and gruesome work, is more a true fulfillment of the Buddha's teachings than is one who meditates on the weekend and wears prayer beads because it is ""cool.""

Sorry to sermonize, but this movie is not only a wonderful work of cinema, it is a Buddhist teaching in itself. Compassion MUST be coupled with the very difficult work of serving others.",1169164800,19,1727,4.808080808080808
546377,5,6303073085,"Director Kon Ichikawa, known for his harrowing and gritty portrayal on the brutality of war in the film ""Fires on the Plain,"" which took place on the Philippine Island of Leyte, during WWII, has given us a truly great look at the defeated Japanese army in Burma at the close of the war. ""Burmese Harp,"" not unlike ""Fires on the Plain"" deals with the defeated Japanese army. However, where ""Fires on the Plain"" shows the viewer the despair of Private Tamura, the film ""Burmese Harp"" gives us a look into the spiritual awakening of one Japanese soldier towards the end of World War Two. The soldier and main protagonist is named Mizushima (Shoji Yasui).

Moreover, unlike Ichikawa's later film ""Fires on the Plain"" this film is not so much about the hellish nighmare of fighting a war, as much as it deals with the hellish aftermath of the Burma Campaign, and how the horror of this tragic campaign weighs heavily on the conscience of one Japanese soldier. For those of you who are not familiar with WWII, or the Burma Campaign; it was in Burma where the Japanese Imperial army suffered the greatest loss of life in World War II. In the film, Mizushima agrees to go to a fortified mountain stronghold, where the last remnants of Japanese soldiers are holed up, refusing to surrender. He is to inform them of the surrender of Japan, and for those inside to lay down there arms in order to return to Japan. However, something goes terribly wrong as the company of Japanese soldiers refuse to surrender.

Narrowly escaping death himself, Mizushima decides not to return to his company, or Japan. For something has changed. He is nursed to health by a priest, and steals the priests clothes: That of a Buddhist Monk. As he proceeds across Burma, he sees nothing but the unburied corpses of dead Japanese. Mizushima is affected by seeing these unburied dead of his fellow Japanese countryman, and in a symbolic death and rebirth, he assumes the role of a monk and decides not to return to his unit in the POW camp, or even to return to Japan until ALL of his fellows soldiers are buried.

He begins the task of burying any and all Japanese dead that he comes across in his journey across Burma: A very formidalble task indeed! Mizushima's horror at seeing the bodies of the unburied dead have had a profound affect on him, and he has become a different person. This is a truly profound and poignant film. And considering that this film was released in 1956, a mere 11 years after the end of World War Two, makes this a classic film which must rank right up there with some of the greatest antiwar films of all-time. This film predates ""Fires on the Plain,"" by a good 3 years. For an early film dealing with this war, I believe this is one of the greatest films to come out of Japan dealing with the trauma of WWII. Especially considering is was directed by a Japanese, and released in Japan. A must see, and highly recommended.",1122854400,14,2920,4.579349904397706
546378,5,6303073085,"At the end of the WW2, a survivor of a Japanese Command, follows his bliss when he takes a decision: to disguise himself as a monk . He will make a reflexive tour, a powerful insight act, a soul searching journey soul searching back  to those places where his fellow comrades met the death. This redemption fact once more completes the mythical cycle of the life: birth and innocence, maturity and experience and finally wisdom and redemption.

If you haven' t seen  yet this acclaimed film, it's time for you to make it, because this is a milestone film about the existence ' sense, and the finding of a superb gem: an original film that you will never forget in the rest of your life.

It's useless to tell this is one of my beloved films in my personal collection. Ichikawa was the same director of Fire on the plains.

It's absolutely unbelievable this film has not been released yet on DVD format.",1120176000,16,902,4.50920245398773

I would add only one thing.  The climactic scene in which the converted monk sits at night talking to his former fellow soliders who are behind a tall chainlink fence (they are now in a POW camp waiting to be shipped home to Japan) is one of the most moving moments I've ever experienced.  This once scene captures exactly what it means for the individual to follow his (or her) own destiny.",1089158400,18,541,4.2745098039215685
546380,5,6303073085,"Many people, when they think of Buddhism, think of blissful meditation and serene contemplation. This movie graphically depicts the other side of Buddhism;i.e., hard work in the real world, in the real transformation of oneself and in one's efforts to help other beings, no matter how difficult or horrific the circumstances.
The film concerns a Japanese soldier separated from his unit in Burma, at the very end of WW II and its immediate aftermath. As he journeys to find his unit in a POW camp, he is confronted, at every turn in this wasteland of war, with dead and unburied fellow Japanese soldiers. At first, he disguises himself as a Buddhist monk (knowing that the Burmese respect and feed their monks). When he comes across British hospital staff burying an unknown Japanese soldier, with a formal Christian burial service and great respect, he is transformed. He recalls the hundreds of dead and unburied Japanese soldiers he had seen in his journey, he becomes a true Buddhist monk, and makes a singular and difficult vow; he will not return to Japan until he has buried all of the corpses he had seen.

Although the stark scenery of the Burmese landscape is beautifully captured, the plot about a Japanese soldier who decides to stay on in Burma to bury the dead is a little trite. The whole is treated in a puerile manner, with a lot of singing and harp playing. The acting is rather hammy. Even the main singular tune, repeated throughout, has an ambiguous harmonic structure towards the end of the tune. The simple Burmese harp cannot produce those melodious sounds in the soundtrack. It is obvious that Burmese and or Japanese actors wore beards and moustaches to portray the British and Indian troops.

However, I found the scene of the nuns burying the Japanese dead quite moving.",1445212800,,754,4.661654135338346
7836129,3,6303073085,"BIRUMA NO TATEGOTO (THE BURMESE HARP).  Make Choral Music, Not War.
Director:  Kon Ichikawa
DVD
1956
Rating = ***
Film = three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Kon Ichikawa's bizarre WWII mash-up of choral music, anti-war narrative, kinder and gentler Japanese soldiers, and Japan locations un-successfully masquerading as Burma makes for a fascinating film.  Basically it is a photoplay of fantasized propaganda whipped up by the script writer, Natta Wada (the Director's wife), so just park your brain next to your disc player and enjoy the ride (especially if you simply crave endless choral renditions of the 19th Century song, HOME, SWEET HOME).  In addition to choral arrangements, an obviously prop harp (the ""Burmese harp"" of the title) serves to link together scenes with emotional fluidity. This film is the first (and likely the only) dramatic (i.e., non-musical) movie to stage a military surrender through singing!  (Could choral singing contests be the key to eradicating global armed conflicts?!)  That said, the movie is, surprisingly, not maudlin, but much too long and often boring.  Besides countless close-ups of choral singers, the closing scenes consist of reading an excruciatingly long letter by a Japanese army captain to his troops.  They are stuck on a ship taking them home (so the troops can not escape by jumping to the next DVD chapter!).  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is excellent especially for exterior location shots.  (It is a shame the movie was not shot in color.)  Scene lighting is  exceptional and some of the best exhibited in Japanese films of the era.  Akira Ifukube's score is one of the best composed for a Japanese film after the war.  Subtitles are okay, but, interestingly, signs posted in English are not translated into Japanese.  Well worth watching at least once.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1430524800,,1877,5.1827242524916945
