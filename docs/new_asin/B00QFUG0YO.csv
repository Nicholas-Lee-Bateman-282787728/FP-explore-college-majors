6866227,5,B00QFUG0YO,One if my favorite series! Edie Falco is outstanding! Highly recommend!,1424044800,,71,5.545454545454546
6866228,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Fantastic! One of the best seasons of nurse Jackie yet. I watched all the DVD episodes in just two nights. Intense and stressful, but very compelling.",1423872000,,150,4.8076923076923075
6866229,5,B00QFUG0YO,"We just finished watching Nurse Jackie Season 6. Edie Falco and the rest of the cast have done an outstanding job of telling the story of a drug addict and how it affects the people who love her and work with her.
While I applaud the actors I do have some problems with the writers and how they told the story. There is no way that an impaired nurse could have functioned so long and done her job so well given the level of her addiction. I also find it hard to believe that the people around her wouldn't have figured out her lies and even when they do figure out her lies cover for her and still show her sympathy.
That said, this story paints a very real picture about drug addiction and how the addict only cares about one thing. Getting their fix. In order to get a fix they give up husbands, the love of their children, jobs, friendships, and ultimately their health.
It is a sad but very realistic story. However I must stress to those who are not in the medical profession that so many of the medical scenes just would not have happened that way and are unrealistic to say the least..",1423872000,2,1092,4.2548076923076925
6866230,3,B00QFUG0YO,"I just started watching Season 6, and am, after 3 episodes, profoundly disappointed.  It seems that NJ is degenerating into the soft-porn entertainment paradigm that currently litters the television  landscape.  While I understand that romance and sex is part of the human experience, I don't need to be deluged with ""adult"" content in lieu of consistently engaging drama.  If that's what the masses want it is, regrettably, what it is, but count me out.",1423699200,2,454,5.094594594594595
6866231,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Nurse Jackie is one of my favorite TV series and, I believe, Season 6 is the best season to date.  It is smart, realistic and unsentimental.  The twists and turns take viewers by surprise.  Once again, Jackie is cornered.  What's to become of her?",1422403200,,247,4.545454545454546
6866232,4,B00QFUG0YO,Such a good show you'll see why Eddie Falco is always nominated for the Golden globe can't believe season 7 is the end of this series,1421625600,,133,4.153846153846154
6866233,5,B00QFUG0YO,"It is a credit to Edie Falco that she has been willing to take this character this far. Most of us like Edie Falco. We loved her on THE SOPRANOS. But nothing she did on that mobster show is quite as bad as what her character does in this show. On a day to day basis, her character is willing to do just about anything in order to get her next drug fix. (She did relapse at the concluding episode of last season so that is where we picked up.) Worst of all, she lies all of the time. Her constant lying is very draining. After an hour with her I hope I never have to be in her presence again but then the next episode appears a week later and I'm ready for her to lie to me again non-stop. So it is amazing that Falco and her team of writers and other actors and producers have managed to replicate the experience of being involved with a drug addict so thoroughly that this season I almost felt as if I were living with one myself.  It is a harrowing look.

We all love Zoe in this show. And Zoe can be seen as this woman's last life line. Falco does something so shocking that Zoe figures it out and issues an ultimatum. If this show is planning to culminate in Jackie and Zoe as the two end characters locked into battle, all I can say is ""bring it on and ASAP.""

This truly is the second golden age of televison.",1420934400,17,1315,4.030651340996169
6866234,5,B00QFUG0YO,"I don't want to say too much about this season, there are so many surprises! Suffice it to say that for Jackie, the chickens are finally coming home to roost. Her lucky streak is at and end and her relationships with friends and family won't take the strain. At the end of last season we see Jackie relapse and let's just say it's a long relapse with just a break or two! But the drugs and her pathological need to lie in order to keep using are winning every time. We discover something else long suspected, her lies and deception go further than her use, they permeate her personality. I always liked her character, it's a testament to Edie Falco's skill that one still could despite her actions. But now Falco is ready for us to not like the character sometimes. Just as her extended family, her sponsor, and her friends at the hospital are, we're fed up! The remainder of the cast turns in terrific performances as well especially Merritt Weaver who deservedly won the Emmy last year. Some say this show has gone on too long but after a shocking finale, I for one am ready for one last round!",1420416000,30,1096,4.430693069306931

It is so true to life that It could be a documentary but I want some form of entertainment in a series and Season Six is a complete let down. I was frustrated with her poisonous acts of deceit and her disregard for everyone. Yes, this is the face of a drug addict but can we at least have some story line surrounding her that isn't disgusting?
 All the other great characters have taken a backseat to  the ""Jackie Show"", very sad !",1427587200,,503,4.229166666666667

6866366,5,B00QFUG0YO,"ORANGE might be the color of Nurse Jackie Peytons new scrubs by the time we get to Season 7 of Showtimes Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning series.
Even if youve missed a couple of seasons, its easy to jump back into the dramedy about a gifted but drug addicted nurse who works at a busy New York City hospital ER. By Season 6, Jackie, in an Emmy-winning performance by Edie Falco, and her long suffering spouse, bar owner Kevin (Dominic Fumusa), have divorced. Kevin has a new love and, by seasons end, will remarry. The Peyton girls  Grace (Ruby Jerins) and Fiona (Mackenzie Aladjem)  are living with Dad and continue to struggle. Puberty and school does that, along with the parental split and dealing with the effects of Moms addiction.
Because, no matter the consequences, Jackie cant quit. Shes been through rehab multiple times; goes to 12-Step programs, has a good sponsor, played by Julie White, and an amazing support group of friends and co-workers.
It wouldnt necessarily serve me or the show if I was thinking in terms of making her likable, Falco says in the bonus feature, Deceit, Descent, Destruction: Jackies Fall. By the time they're in the throes of the low parts of their addiction, addicts are not likable. I want the show to be funny and enjoyable and watchable, but more important to me is that it be true to life in so far as addiction is concerned.
In past seasons, Jackie was the superwoman of the ER, barreling through crisis after crisis. Her pill-popping habit kept her going through physical pain, long hours and crazy situations. Its safe to say  without spoiling  that Nurse Jackie has now become the craziest situation going, and that the person who was driven by good intentions is now simply compelled to survive discovery.
And her character begins to change. The biggest envoy comes by way of Zoey Barkow of the teddy-bear scrubs played by the ingenious Merritt Wever, another Emmy-winner for her work on Nurse Jackie. And its a shock.
Again, Showtime provides a 1080p transfer with excellent color and detail. The soundtrack is dialogue-driven, so theres not much in the way of surround effects. Youll be too transfixed by whats going on to notice anything else anyway. Bonus features also include deleted scenes, several episode commentaries with cast and crew, and a featurette on Growing Up Peyton showcasing Ruby Jerins, who plays Jackies oldest daughter.
Nurse Jackie: Season 7 is slated to begin April 12, 2015, on Showtime. Thats plenty of time to catch up on a series thats more than worth repeat views.   Kay Reynolds",1426896000,2,2559,4.844393592677346

6866410,1,B00QFUG0YO,The quality of the disks were very dark and one would not load correctly. Very disappointed in product quality.,1426032000,,111,4.894736842105263

6866413,5,B00QFUG0YO,"The drama and laughs continue in this wonderful Showtime series starring the incomparable Edie Falco. Season 6 of Nurse Jackie delivers on every level imaginable with the best writing and direction since Season 2. If you were a Jackie fan, but started to lose interest for any reason, I strongly suggest coming back for this season. It's a wild ride.",1425945600,,350,4.85
6866414,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Love this show and season 6 brings back all the ""highs"" and lows of Jackie's continual addiction problems.  Wish the seasons were longer though, always feels like a tease.",1425859200,,171,4.896551724137931
6866415,5,B00QFUG0YO,"(Spoilers-ish) I thought this season was the best. I watched the last episode three times. Jackie is so much on a downward, denial, immature path that she gets her comeuppance. Finally.  And satisfyingly so.",1425772800,,207,5.088235294117647
6866416,5,B00QFUG0YO,Jackie's addiction continues to destroy her .....,1425686400,,49,6.142857142857143
6866417,5,B00QFUG0YO,Falco does a quality show. I am very invested in characters and plot line. Priced right.,1425427200,,88,4.5625
6866418,5,B00QFUG0YO,One of my favorite ER nurses to be sure! Jackie seems to multitask everything in her life from saving patients and giving wise advice to having impromptu sex and doing drugs (Again). I love her and it's another great season I only wish they were more episodes and I know many will agree with me! Enjoy.,1425427200,2,302,4.410714285714286
6866419,5,B00QFUG0YO,"From a less than favorite, transitional 5th season, season 6 reminds me why its one of my fav tv series ever.",1425081600,,109,4.238095238095238
6866430,5,B00QFUG0YO,"I AM A RETIRED NURSE NEVER ON DRUGS BUT  SURE CAN UNDERSTAND JACKIE'S FRUSTRATION.  SO YES,  I AM A BIG JACKIEFAN.",1424908800,,114,4.333333333333333
6866431,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Nurse Jackie really hit bottom this season, not unlike what can happens in any addict's life.  And as usual Edie Falco is fantastic in the role!  Looking forward to next season to see how she can recover from this mess.  Will she ever be able to work as a nurse again after her arrest?  And will her daughter Grace follow Jackie down the same rabbit hole of lies and addiction!.",1424822400,,378,4.357142857142857
6866432,5,B00QFUG0YO,I'm a huge fan of Nurse Jackie and this Season does not disappoint.,1424736000,,67,4.230769230769231

6866435,5,B00QFUG0YO,I own all seasons of my fave show nurse jackie and my mouth dropped every episode of this entire season! She is Outta control in this season! Wow I can't wait to see season 7 this spring :),1424563200,,189,4.0
6866436,5,B00QFUG0YO,great,1424476800,,5,5.0
6866437,5,B00QFUG0YO,"I am a Nurse Jackie addict.........having said this I can say that her addiction in this season seemed to dominate the entire series, and quite frankly I got tired of it.  The rest of the cast which has been a crucial part of making this series successful were minor, with no real stories of their own. Was shocked at how quickly they exited Morris Chestnut without any attachment to their relationship.  I often do a Nurse Jackie marathon of all the series, but season 6 will not be included in my marathon sadly enuff.",1424390400,2,520,4.5212765957446805
6866438,3,B00QFUG0YO,I loved the first five seasons of this show but this one bored me and I did not even finish it.  I'm sick to death of this woman's constant drug use.  I want to scream at her to get a real life.  I also can't stand her weird kids.  I realize it is a fictional show and not real life but OMG that one kid who is close in age to being a teen wanting to be held like a baby is too much for me.  Ugh.,1424390400,4,396,3.5057471264367814
6866439,1,B00QFUG0YO,"I'm giving this 1 star, not for he quality of the show, but for the misleading cover art. It says ""Blu-ray + Digital HD"" so *thought* there would be a digital copy I could download to my computer. Instead it's the awful, dreadful UltraViolet and Flixster and their cloud/locker nonsense. If I had known this, I would've purchased this on iTunes (and the only reason why I wanted this was because I have all the other seasons on Blu-ray and wanted consistency... regretting that now). Buyer beware!!!",1424131200,5,499,4.747126436781609
8691136,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Great writing, great acting.  Zoe is put into sad and impossible positions by Jackie this season (as is pretty much everyone else). Nonetheless, Jackie's a saint for continuing to attempt to be Grace's mother at all. Kevin's pre-wedding events and wedding were a LOT for Jackie to see/handle... without the deliberate interference of that hypocritical, sadistic, and awful daughter. Kevin the dou***, was as bad, but no surprise there. The scene between Nurse Jackie and Helen/ ""Nancy Wood"" was one of the best in the series.  Deliciously diabolical as to how Jackie gets ""rid"" of her sponsor....soooo screwed up, but I loved it!  Good hospital scenes, however, as a Type 1 diabetic myself, no diabetic would've recovered from 800 units of insulin THAT fast. Five units is enough to kill me. Dr. Roman makes me laugh out loud.  Awesome season!",1532995200,,843,5.0
8691137,5,B00QFUG0YO,"Great series , highly recommended",1526428800,,33,5.8
8691138,5,B00QFUG0YO,"This is a classic series with drama, comedy and reality all present in equal quantities.  I don't think a series gets any better than this.  Well done, particularly to Edie Falco.",1520812800,,179,4.741935483870968
8691139,5,B00QFUG0YO,"""Nurse Jackie"" is series TV at its best.  Great ensemble of actors, humor, drama, dark humor and drama, story lines that warm your heart, events that you don't see coming.  I love this show.",1493596800,,190,4.5588235294117645
