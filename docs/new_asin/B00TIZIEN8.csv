7010499,5,B00TIZIEN8,"Rifftrax DvDs are the best way to liven a party. Good enough to watch, bad enough to laugh at, and liberating for hanging out in front of the movie instead of sitting in focused attention.

Rifftrax doing a full movie is a treat of its own, but doing a modern legend like birdemic is magnificent. The badness of the movie itself may be overwhelming for first time riffers or mst3k fans, try to start them off on Werewolf or Pumaman from MST3K if you need to get their endurance up, but if they are ready for Manos they are ready for this big hilarious white turd.",1448755200,,563,4.311320754716981
7010500,5,B00TIZIEN8,It's the BEST WORST MOVIE you will ever see!  Watch it with friends and adult beverages to fully appreciate the humor. If you grew up on MST3000 you will LOVE this!,1447804800,,164,4.290322580645161
7010501,5,B00TIZIEN8,"Staggeringly bad feature film, perfect fodder for the Rifftrax-MST-CinematicT treatment.  This picture makes Plan Nine From Outer Space look like Gone With The Wind.  It should be required study at cinema school as it demonstrates every conceivable method you can use to stink-up a film: ludicrously lame plot; stupid dialogue; blown lines; boring and implausible action scenes; zero continuity, poor technical work (camera, lighting, AND sound); inept staging, make-up, and wardrobe; and acting that would disgrace a grade school Easter pageant.  The so-called CGI effects look like they were done with an abacus and slide rule instead of a computer.  This picture simply has to be seen to be believed.  To cite just one example of how little effort went into it, there's one scene in which the beautiful model strips to make love to her boyfriend, and the bottom of her feet are filthy with dirt.  Obviously her feet got dirty during multiple takes (God, I'd love to see the takes they DIDN'T use) but since she has had her shoes on the entire movie the only conclusion you can draw within the story is this top-tier fashion model never bathes.  Yuck.
There have been a great many motion pictures nominated for worst film of all time, and no clear consensus has ever been reached.  But what makes Birdemic stand out from its competition is that it purports to promote itself as a message film.  Seriously, it's supposed to be a clarion call against the dangers of global warning, as well as an appeal for world peace.  At no time do they miss an opportunity to try and drill excruciating 'green' propaganda into your head, all the while solemnly praising Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth in terms usually reserved for Shakespeare or a really clever dirty limerick.  But since the same actors who are clumsily mispronouncing Greenpeace slogans throughout the movie are also driving SUVs and shooting eagles with machine guns, you can't even give them credit for consistency, let alone sincerity or having a good idea.
With most movies, the Rifftrax crew -three familiar veterans of the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 TV show- occasionally come across as being too orchestrated and scripted, which seems to be an inherent problem in their chosen profession (Cinematic Titanic, another riffing ensemble of the same lineage but which includes the original show's founder, Joel Hodgson, also has problems with this).  Sometimes they strive to be too clever and eclectic and the jokes fall flat.  But Birdemic is just SO bad, so appallingly awful, that it relieves the riffers from all pressure to be brilliant, or even good: they could literally sit there like Beavis & Butthead, snickering lewdly at any perceived scatological references, and get by just fine.  Fortunately, they play it just right, and this time their riffing is spot-on, never missing a good opportunity but not overplaying their hand either.  The combination of the crew's professionalism and the film's sheer putrescence propel Birdemic to the top rank of the Rifftrax offerings, right up there (if not ahead of) previous classics like The Guy From Harlem and their several Christmas-themed disks.
Incidentally, unlike most really rotten movies, this one has a sequel, Birdemic 2.  It is nearly as bad as its predecessor.  The big question generated by the sequel is did the filmmakers try to make a decent movie this time, or are they trying to emulate the cult 'success' of the original article.  I've watched both pictures a dozen or so times, and given the matter way too much thought, but cannot escape the conclusion that you would have to be a cinematic genius non-pareil to intentionally make a motion picture as bad as either of these turkeys.  I fear these pictures, Birdemic and Birdemic II, are the genuine article.",1446249600,3,3794,4.993650793650794

7010503,5,B00TIZIEN8,"Absolutely hilarious! Watched it with some friends, and they loved it as well. As my buddy Matt texted me later, ""Yay parking! Yay fake birds! Boo real birds that didn't Birdemic and stuff."" I loved how the people in the movie were shooting and running around like idiots while, in the background, the rest of the world seemed to be going on just as normal.",1438646400,2,357,4.507692307692308
7010504,5,B00TIZIEN8,"We were thinking the same thing as the end credits rolled, but my partner said it first: ""My god,"" he laughed, ""it's worse than MANOS!""

BIRDEMIC has to be seen to be disbelieved. A no-budget, apocalyptic fantasy of birds going postal on humankind, it features hilariously bad special effects, endless driving and parking sequences, a dim-witted internet millionaire and his supermodel girlfriend (who spend a lot of their time hanging out in cheap restaurants at the local mall), interminable lectures on the evils of fossil fuels and global warming by characters who look and sound mentally ill, and a now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't soundtrack. The movie's an unintentional laugh riot on its own, but of course it's the riffing by Mike, Kevin, and Bill, firing on all cylinders in front of a Nashville audience, that lifts BIRDEMIC to the rank of a comedy masterpiece. What can I say? You'll never hear the words ""solar panel"" quite the same way again.

The feature is preceded by the short ""Norman Checks In,"" in which our titular, hangdog hero continues to endure the indignities of life in the early 1970s.",1427673600,6,1110,5.0271739130434785
7010505,5,B00TIZIEN8,RiffTrax rocks.  Birdemic rocks.  Great release.  Hilarious.,1427587200,,60,7.285714285714286
7010506,3,B00TIZIEN8,"Some hilarious lines, both from the movie and from Rifftrax. ""The human parade balloon"" has us in stitches.
3 stars for the riffing...coulda been even more biting toward the so so so obvious California leftie propaganda messages in this movie, but? They came through and nailed it quite a bit, anyway. As for the movie itself, well, I can picture AlGore clapping furiously like a mechanical, coin-operated monkey, because his ""documentary"" was mentioned in the first...what...reel? Looks like this movie (not a film, really) was edited in iMovie 1. Not that I have anything against first version of iMovie, but, well, maybe they could've at least TRIED Final Cut Pro 1 on a Flower Power G3 iMac with 1 whole gig of RAM. Huddible, absolutely teddible effects...stick-on birds, balloon birds...""deadly"" acidic creamed corn bird vomit (birdcrap?).
No wonder California is going down the tubes, with movies like Birdemic setting the save the planet pace. Oh, and product placement was all over the place in this movie. First one I noticed was State Farm Insurance. I immediately had that song in my head: ""Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there"". I guess even the anti-corporate elites (subhumans?) who made this crap had no problem prostituting themselves for a few bucks, just half enough, maybe, to buy the two cans of expired Del Monte creamed corn and 2 (yep! Not one, but TWO of them!) toy guns. A couple of broken Six Fingers (Man alive!) woulda been more convincing.
Thanks, movie, for the laughs and endless mouth-agape, back and forth headshaking incredulousnessnessnessness (my mouth, my head). Thanks Kevin, Mike and Bill for the laughs, too. Truly unbelievable. I wanted to just...turn away...it was such a rotten movie, but I just HAD TO WATCH.",1508457600,,1757,5.02054794520548
7010507,4,B00TIZIEN8,The RiffTrax crew really shines when they do it live.  Having watched a number of their movie presentations I just wanted to perhaps let them know by this comment how much I enjoy their work.  The guys (and gals) who make the dub-overs are not only clever but incredibly observant.,1507852800,3,281,4.6
7010508,4,B00TIZIEN8,One of the worst movies ever made. They did a good job with the riffing. Extra points for more Norman clips too.,1507593600,,112,4.136363636363637

7010510,5,B00TIZIEN8,"No surprise here on how absolutely hysterical this movie already was prior to Rifftrax getting a hold of it. I didn't expect it, but when I put the DVD in and the main menu music playing was ""hanging out"", I think I laughed for close to 10 minutes. This one is a mandatory own for anyone fan of either Rifftrax or MST 3 K. Simply brilliant.",1506643200,2,340,4.166666666666667
7010511,5,B00TIZIEN8,For my money The Final Sacrifice is the epitome of MST3K riffing.  This piece of crap is a very close second.  I would equate it with AVALANCHE from the new season.  The doofus  that stars in this thing is the WORST ACTOR OF ALL TIME!  I've seen people play bodies on tv police procedurals with more pizzaz and better mastery of their lines.  It is also completely obvious that they shot this without any permissions.  Watching them attempt to pull out into traffic on a supposedly empty road is hilarious.  The fact that cars are proceeding normally on the other side of the road is priceless.  Watch and enjoy the badness.,1506470400,4,624,4.54954954954955

7010517,5,B00TIZIEN8,"OMG! A few minutes before I watched this Birdemic film, I watched ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"". The actors in that film deserved Oscars compared to the dufus duds in Birdemic.  RiffTrax totally nailed this terrible sludge of a brain numbing film. I've seen some really bad movies in my day but Birdemic takes the cake. The only way I'd ever watch this thing is with the hilarious narrative from the RiffTrax guys!",1504742400,,409,4.680555555555555
7010518,5,B00TIZIEN8,"Wow... just wow. This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Mike says it's like the new Manos but it's so much worse, it's also hysterically funny. It was so painfully bad I barely made it through but I also laughed out loud quite bit too.  I may watch it again but not for a long long time. I just don't think  I can take the excitement of all those parking scenes again so soon.",1504569600,3,387,4.078947368421052
7010519,5,B00TIZIEN8,Birdemic is like if The Sims came to life. The guys do an awesome job skewering this film that is so bad I really feel sorry for everyone involved.,1504051200,,147,4.103448275862069
7010520,5,B00TIZIEN8,"Surprisingly, Birdemic features very few birds. In this particular Rifftrax performance (which opens with a ""Norman"" short), you don't see your first glimpse of a bird until 39 minutes in... and you don't see any deadly bird attacks until the 1 hour and 3 minute mark! Of course, the special effects in this movie are legendary for their awfulness. The birds themselves look like cheap clip-art gifs that were crudely copy+pasted into frame. A majority of this movie is spent watching characters do mundane things, like watch the local news on TV, or attend the world's most boring pumpkin festival. There's also a heavy-handed environmental message crowbarred into the film, which  seems to largely favor ""So-ah Pawas"" (or in English, ""Solar Panels""). Mike, Bill and Kevin manage to make this dreck entertaing however, which is why I'm giving this live performance 5 stars.",1503878400,5,874,5.111888111888112

7010524,5,B00TIZIEN8,I had heard about this abysmal movie for a long time.  Watching it with Rifftrax was a great way to be exposed to it.  It's laughable enough on it's own (Horrifically wonderful special effects) but the riffing  made it the icing on the cake.,1496793600,,241,4.431818181818182

7010527,5,B00TIZIEN8,"The Rifftrax gang are at the top of their game here, but with Nguyen's infamous ""Birdemic"" as the object of riffing, it's almost too easy.

That doesn't mean the experience isn't just as sumptuously terribad, it is.

As they warn you before the feature film, the sound is crappy in places, but that's the actual quality of Birdemic itself. If you ever saw, ""The Room,"" or love ""so bad it's good"" films, and have never indulged in MST3K or Rifftrax, this Live event from the gang is a PERFECT starter piece.",1483574400,3,506,4.549450549450549

7010529,5,B00TIZIEN8,"I thought Plan 9 From Outer Space was bad. I though Manos was bad. I thought Red Zone Cuba was bad. Oh, this is worse.

Birdemic is essentially An Inconvenient Truth put to a movie form, complete with Al Gore's terrible way of speaking. The dialog is dull, the actors quite often talk like they are reading a script, and they look like they are trying too hard to act and so come across and fake. And then the CGI is just pathetically bad. That alone makes this movie worth laughing at. Then you add in the riffing. I can honestly say I haven't laughed this much at any movie I've seen on MST3K.

Here is the synopsis: An Al Gore wannabe meets a lingerie model in a cafe, says I know you, and then next thing you know she lets this dude date her. The wannabe makes a lot of money when the company he works for is sold. So the wannabe decides to invest in solar power. Soon after that, the eagles attack. We later find out that global warming made eagles attack people. For you see, according to a professor in the movie, global warming heats the oceans which affect the eagles' food which make the eagles do crazy things like attack people. If only we would listen to the warning in An Inconvenient truth and gave peace a chance than this all could have been prevented. For you see, the eagles don't attack people in the forests. But in the end, the eagles are scared off giving us to think about how we are hurting mother earth.

Sounds stupid? Well, it is. That is what makes this one of the funniest riffs you will ever see.",1483315200,,1527,4.258620689655173

Until they get to the woods, all the locations are mind numbing and there isn't a single actor that has any sort of natural grace.  But- I ended up watching the whole thing somehow.  The riffs are pretty good.  I only gave it four stars because the whole ""live"" experience makes it less fun for me.

Birdemic is a ridiculously disjointed rambling story with bad writing, bad video quality, bad acting, bad editing, bad special effects, bad... well, bad everything.  It takes a painfully long time for the Birds to engage in their Birdemic leaving one to wonder what the point of the movie is.  It turns out it's really just a horrible way to propagate an anti-global warming agenda.

Mike, Kevin, and Bill are at the top of their game on this one although, to be completely fair, Birdemic gives them an awful lot to work with.  If you enjoy Rifftrax or MST3K, you really owe it to yourself to spend the time to watch Rifftrax Live - Birdemic, Shock and Terror.",1511136000,4,730,4.584615384615384
