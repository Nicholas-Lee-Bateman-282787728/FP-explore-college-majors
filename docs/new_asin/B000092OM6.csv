1876921,5,B000092OM6,"I was a guitar ""strummer"" for several years, and decided to learn more about picking the lead parts. This DVD set is right on the money. The production quality is great. Steve has a very pleasant personality, and I feel like I am setting in a room with a real instructor. His playing ability is top notch. He takes you through each of the tunes at varying speeds so most anyone can keep up and also feel challenged. At the end of each DVD he plays one of the tunes freestyle where he really opens up and shows why he has won national flatpicking championships. I would give this review 6 stars if possible. I would recommend that you have a little experience under your belt for this one, but he does offer some basic advice along the way. I have learned a ton of good stuff, and have already ordered more of Steve's products. Excellent!!",1184544000,,838,4.378205128205129
1876922,5,B000092OM6,"I am very happy with the quality and content of the Learning to Flatpick DVD set.  Steve Kaufman does an excellent job of leading the viewer through the various techniques introduced in the lessons.  If your interested in the bluegrass flatpicking style, then you will not be dissapointed with this set of lessons.",1123804800,5,314,4.90566037735849
1876923,5,B000092OM6,"I've used several of Steve Kaufman's videos and what really sets them apart is his superb way of organizing the material and presenting it on screen. Unlike the ""look at me play fast"" that seems to be the norm he goes thru things at just the right pace for a beginner. You should have some basics and know your chords in first position before moving into this video, but even if you don't and have the desire then just plunge in. Listening to this guy play will keep you motivated. Excellent choice for anyone who llikes this tyle.",1107043200,9,531,4.428571428571429

7988674,5,B000092OM6,Easy to follow lessons that are meant for an intermediate guitar player. Insert a DVD into your computer and you'll find tabs in PDF form for the tunes on the DVD. Kaufman's teaching style is friendly and engaging. You may not reach his championship playing level but your picking will definitely improve.,1493596800,,305,4.884615384615385

7988678,4,B000092OM6,"Kaufman is an excellent instructor, and his warm, folksy manner puts you at ease. It's very helpful that he often gives an easy and a more difficult version for three songs, ""Cripple Creek,"" ""Hand Me Down My Walking Cane,"" and ""Wildwood Flower.""  Following are three more, with one version each.  Thus the DVD has a total of 6 songs in its 65 minutes, and a small pamphlet gives the sheet music and tablature for each.

A problem with this DVD is the problem with most instructional DVDs.  There are often not enough songs to practice any one skill well.  Thus his instructional book, ""Mel Bay's Complete Flatpicking Guitar Book"" has about 30 songs in it, many with several versions.  You need practice with a few dozen songs to really develop basic skills in flatpicking.  It is true that there are two more DVDs in this series, each containing about 6 new songs.

My advice is to get the DVDs as well as the book, and use both in tandem.  That's what works best for me. It's nice to have the personal touch of a person and a voice in the video, and the abundance of instruction in the book.  Virtually all of the songs in the DVDs are contained in the book, sometimes in different versions. It's also fun to learn more songs and build your repertory, and you can take the book anywhere, on a camping trip, and use it to practice (and scare away the bears).",1314144000,2,1358,4.439516129032258
7988679,5,B000092OM6,"If you want to flatpick this is the man to inspire and teach you! Better have a fair base to work from that will make learning much easier,in other words know your chord base, just the simple ones,and strum patterns. Listen to Bluegrass so you are familiar with the tunes and go for it. 1st song took 15 minutes maybe.",1270252800,2,318,4.316666666666666
7988680,5,B000092OM6,"This product is great, but comes with an awful amount of homework. the beginner stuff on this is more like intermediate, but i like a good challenge! steve is a good teacher",1239062400,,173,4.4375
7988681,5,B000092OM6,"If you are getting stuck for things to play as a beginner - you know; too many old traditional (no copyright) songs and too many exercises - well Steve Kaufman's set is a great way to develop your picking and left hand speed.  You'll start very slowly and should be able to start doing these DVD songs after starting to play the guitar for about 10 weeks - assuming you are doing about 30 minutes practice a day.  These DVDs will get you using your right hand picking much better, more accurately and faster.  You'll learn how to do alternate stroke picking very well.  Your right hand will get to play simple and then better chords for accompanyment tracks, then single note melody lines and faster single note fingerwork.

If you're learning on a steel string acoustic, these DVDs will show you other ways to play the instrument and get you away from simple stumming along to songs and desperately trying to make your guitar sound like the electic guitar you really wanted to play.  Bluegrass Flatpicking is a great way to get the best from your acoustic steel strung guitar and you'll learn some solo pieces you'll be proud to show off to anyone.  And there's a huge library of flatpicking material out there if you really get into it and want to learn more.

These DVDs are a great way to start and there's a Mel Bay Flatpicking book by Steve that would go well with the DVDs.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Bay-Complete-Flatpicking-Guitar-Book/dp/0786672331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Bay Complete Flatpicking Guitar Book</a>",1199577600,7,1582,5.104651162790698
7988682,5,B000092OM6,"I couldn't be more pleased with this DVD set. Steve is a very competent instructor who introduces flatpicking guitar at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow. He makes you feel as though you are sitting in a room with him enjoying private lessons. The DVD set does assume some knowledge of basic chords and strumming technique, but Steve begins very slowly, addressing fundamental issues that are absent in other instructional sets.

Thanks to Homespun, the format is clear and accessible. Unlike other sets that are presented more like reference books, Steve's DVDs focus on helping you use specific techniques in well-known bluegrass songs. Instead of having you work through boring drills and exercises, he helps you work through short songs that gradually increase in difficulty. Most songs are presented first in a stripped-down version at a slow pace and then dressed up into something a little more challenging and fun.

I've had a lot of fun with this set and have already seen my skills improve in the month I have been working through the DVDs. I will certainly be investing in more tools by Steve that carry the Homespun label.",1187308800,3,1145,4.866666666666666
