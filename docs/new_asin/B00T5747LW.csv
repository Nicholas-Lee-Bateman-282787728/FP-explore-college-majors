So glad they were able to get a headstone for her grave after all these years.",1513468800,,220,4.475
8700326,5,B00T5747LW,"I have become completely obsessed with the Thanhouser movies from a long ago era after receiving both volumes one and two collections of their short movies. it's like going back one hundred years in time to watch these talented, attractive performers. my favorite is ""petticoat camp"" from 1912 that stars Florence Labadie and several other studio regulars. what fascinates in this short movie is that everyone is so natural and charming, it's like watching a home movie without everyone having to posture and perform within a studio. the women and men come across as real live people rather than actors performing in a new medium. another goodie is ""evidence of the film"" which also stars the very busy Florence Labadie and we get a glimpse of a real film producing office where workers are seen preparing film for shipment. I wish there were more collections available and let us take another trip into the far past of a long forgotten America.",1508457600,,945,4.875776397515528
8700327,5,B00T5747LW,"The documentary was very informative and well done. And the two Thanhouser short films, Petticoat Camp and The Evidence of the Film were very enjoyable.",1440201600,,152,5.12
8700328,5,B00T5747LW,"I saw this wonderful documentary recently on TCM and it is an excellent look at the early history of American cinema, before it packed its bags and moved from the East Coast to Hollywood.

Also, on that Sunday night on TCM, this documentary was followed by a selection of Thanhouser short films that can be found in an exceptional collection on DVD entitled ""Thanhouser: A Study In Film, Vol. 1."" And it, too, is available from Amazon at an affordable price.

When I first saw Thanhouser film star Florence LaBadie in ""Petticoat Camp"" (1912) some years ago, I was immediately smitten by her glowing beauty and her vibrant talent. Luckily, a few of her 185 films have survived; and, hopefully, others are waiting to be discovered in film archives from around the world. She was also outstanding in the 1912 version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and ""The Evidence of the Film"" from 1913.

I was shocked to learn in the documentary that Florence was killed in an automobile accident in 1917 at the age of 29. With this tragic event,  Thanhouser Studio lost one of its brightest stars. For almost 100 years, Florence was buried in an unmarked grave. But thanks to Ned Thanhouser, the family's keeper of the flame, in 2014 along with other film buffs, students, and historians, the necessary funds were raised to erect a grave monument celebrating the life of this nearly forgotten film star.

And speaking of Ned Thanhouser, thank you for all the work you have done through the years (and continue to do) to honor the legacy of your grandparents through the collection and preservation of their groundbreaking film work.

Anyone who has not experienced these amazing Thanhouser films, may want to give them a try.  A good stating point and companion piece to this documentary would be ""Thanhouser: A Study In Film, Vol 1,"" a DVD collection of seven early Thanhouser films.",1436572800,2,1867,4.779503105590062
