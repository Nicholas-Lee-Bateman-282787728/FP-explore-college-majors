8080608,5,B000AYEIPO,"All of Bill Zebub's movies are great, primarily his comedies. He is really good at forming complex intertwining plots that seem rather simple at a glance. Bad Acid is no different. It is the tale of an acid addict who goes on a series of horrible LSD trips. The results are rather comedic and the laughs are in abundance.

The film chronicles Bill Zebub's weekend while he is tripping on ""bad acid"". Not only does he have to deal with the horrors that the drug bring him, but he has to manage a radio show, his girlfriend and his boss. Bill loves to go around partying but his girlfriend wants him to spend more time with her which gets Bill into a lot of trouble and eventually risks losing everything with his habit.

Great soundtrack too. The tunes never stop, and that's a good thing because they're all fantastic numbers by the likes of Shape of Despair, Immolation, The Wicked, Korovakill, Thy Surpent, Bethlehem and Mercyful Fate.

The acting is generally better than people say because the movie is scripted just like the language of ""normal people"" which makes a nice realistic flow for the movie.

I've seen on too many reviews for Zebub's movies people denoting the movie because of the quality of film and budget. These people are close minded and can't extract the greatness from these films.

Of course this film is not for everybody, but fans of B-List crude rude and appalling comedies will rejoice when seeing this movie. Good job Bill Zebub!",1129248000,12,1459,4.66147859922179
