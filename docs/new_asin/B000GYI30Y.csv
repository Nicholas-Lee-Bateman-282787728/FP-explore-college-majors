Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,,615,4.811320754716981
8135125,3,B000GYI30Y,"The same old recycled ""public domain"" episodes of THE LUCY SHOW...  Just about every single budget-line DVD company you can think of has trundled out these shows.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased the episodes over and over again, but for new viewers looking to introduce themselves to the hilarity of Lucy's world, this is a good place to start.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy and George Burns"" - Lucy steps in as George's new comedy partner in a nightclub act.

""Lucy Meets the Berles"" - Whilst on loan as a secretary for Milton Berle, Lucy suspects the comedian of having an affair with Ruta Lee.

""Lucy Gets a Roommate"" - Mousy librarian Carol Bradford (special guest star Carol Burnett) seems like the housemate from heaven...

""Lucy and John Wayne"" - Lucy interrupts the set of John Wayne's new movie whilst running an errand for the bank.

""Lucy the Fight Manager"" - Don Rickles is a broken-down prizefighter who must rise to the ring again, under Lucy's guidance.

""Lucy the Starmaker"" - Lucy assists Mr. Cheever's nephew (guest star Frankie Avalon) get his start in showbusiness.

""Lucy Meets Robert Goulet"" - When he can't qualify for a loan, Lucy enlists a truck driver in a Robert Goulet look-alike contest.

""Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account"" - In order to securely house Jack Benny's millions, the bank must assemble a foolproof security system...

""Main Street U.S.A."" - Lucy joins forces with Mel Torm to stage a musical protest when a sleepy small town is faced with demolition.

""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard"" - Whilst filming a TV show at the bank, Lucy suspects Sheldon Leonard of being a real bank robber.",1283472000,,2109,4.790055248618785
