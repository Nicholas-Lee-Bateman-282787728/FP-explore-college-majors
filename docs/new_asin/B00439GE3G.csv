5932116,5,B00439GE3G,"This bio-doc is unlike so many others because Eddie is such an unusual and amazing person.  The format was creative, if simplistic, but didn't deter from the message.  Eddie's openness about his failures is striking - not glossed over, and not excused.  He seems to find his stream of consciousness style of comedy almost by accident (the ""Wolves"" sketch is a gem!).  Whether non-Eddie fans would find this DVD appealing is questionable, but Eddie fans will definitely appreciate it.",1268006400,21,483,5.075949367088608
5932117,5,B00439GE3G,"For years Eddie Izzard has entertained my family and I both in his comedic performances and his film performances but never before have we seen this side of Eddie.

I saw Believe for free through Eddie, he posted temporary link via his twitter page and I have seen it several times. Believe is a wonderful and heartfelt look at the life of Eddie Izzard and I thought it was truly amazing. I really came to understand how Eddie comes up with all the great material and how a comedian works on a tour. *SPOILER* Believe touches on themes that are familiar to everyone and tugs at your heart strings, near the end when Eddie is speaking about his mother and mentions how he believes everything he has done was in an attempt to get her to come back, it connected with me, and others, and made me think of my own loss and how true his statement was. One woman even said ""you kept me laughing even when I was so scared"" and then I realized how many lives he has touched.

I have never laughed so much and yet cried so much all in one documentary, this is a true testament to hard work and never giving up. I finished this film and I believed I really could do anything if I truly believed. Thank you Eddie for sharing your incredible life with us, you are a truly stand up guy.

I hope the dvd has some good bonus features and I will update the review when my pre-order arrives. See this film and share it.",1265068800,67,1400,4.235955056179775

5932138,5,B00439GE3G,"I've always enjoyed Eddie Izzard's work and admired his courage, genius, authenticity, audacity and generosity. This was a refreshing insight into a very private man's real life and journey thus far. I highly recommend this...as I recommend all of his work. Bravo to Sarah Townsend's tenacity and insights into making this project a reality worthy of Mr. Izzard's legacy. I hope he will do more projects that let us see the real man behind the legend. It is a very realistic look at the actual path a true Artist goes through - with all the obstacles, rejection, successes, sacrifices, etc. - to give everyone an in-your-face reality check. He deserves all the success he's achieved and so much more. I for one am grateful he Believed in himself until everyone else caught up. I truly Believe that Dreams do come true (if you Believe like Eddie does).",1394582400,2,851,4.795918367346939

He ""came out"" as a transvestite while on one of his comedy tours....maintaining his honesty, humor, and personal courage.  Eddie Izzard is as REAL as they come.

5932145,5,B00439GE3G,"I am so grateful to Eddie for making this documentary. He's very honest about his life, his struggles and his personal transformation. It is very autobiographical, so his fans may find it more interesting than someone who knows nothing about him, but his is a human story, and so I feel that anyone can appreciate it and be inspired by it. If he can come out of nowhere, with no nepotism or show business contacts to open doors for him, and persist for over a decade through sheer stubborn determination and talent and finally succeed in becoming the world's first transvestite comedian, it makes me feel that I can succeed in my own goals, which are far less ambitious. My god this man has courage! This is a truly inspiring and heartwarming story. To be honest, the first time I saw it I cried at the end, but they were happy and amazed tears. I was just so moved by his story. I watch this dvd whenever I need a pep talk to remind me to go after my dreams and never give up, because what else is life for? Thank you Eddie!!!",1346025600,4,1027,4.3264248704663215

and how it got him to where he is today. You see how his
family life, mother's death, boarding school, acting/
comedy in the early days, finely honed his perspective
on life in a truly wonderful, weird, comedic way that
makes you glad he is on this earth to entertain us, and
perhaps look at things in an off beat possible reality.",1287878400,,444,4.056818181818182

5932151,4,B00439GE3G,"In case you are looking for a standup comedy of Eddie's, then look elsewhere, because this is not one. Instead, this is a biographical study on his life. Indeed there are excerpts taken from his standups, even those from back in England before he started cross-dressing publicly; however, this is more of a biography with many interviews from people from his past, one even being Robin Williams whom Eddie sits down with to chat. In this biopic, the brilliant director delves into his past to explore where all his comic roots were born, and strikes a gold-mine's-worth of hardship and perseverance. Eddie did not have an easygoing life, beginning with the death of his mother, followed by boarding school, failed college ambitions, and a series of trials by fire in his comical development that eventually led to his success as one of the most renowned and beloved comedians today. If you are interested in learning more about what fuels Eddie's humor, drives him to success, and propels him to ""Believe"" in becoming more than just an entertainer, then this is a worthwhile biopic. His forceful spirit will impress you and the artful director's experimentally wondrous style will more than likely engage you. It was a bit lagging in certain areas leaving you wondering how long this movie really is, however it does possess its charms and if Eddie strikes a funny bone in your system, then prepare to ""LOL"" more than a few times.",1282867200,6,1430,4.864754098360656
5932152,2,B00439GE3G,"My son and I are huge fans of Izzard, and looked forward to learning more about him.  Alas, this DVD was tedious and repetitious, with very little insight into what drives him (the death of his mother when he was 7 was certainly tragic, but doesn't explain everything, including his transvestism).  ""Believe"" provided a slowww chronology of his career without illuminating much about who he is. e. We actually turned it off after the last ""and then he played X theater"" - never seemed to get out of the 1990s!

Better to re-watch some of his immortal routines, like ""cake or death,"" than to waste money on this disappointment.  Izzard has a right to his privacy, of course, but it's misleading to sell this shallow recitation as *his* ""story"" when all there is (aside from some early family footage) is a lot of unicycle riding, snippets of early collaborators and acts and club listings.  It doesn't get a whole lot deeper or broader than that.  To be fair, perhaps Izzard's innards were revealed in the last few minutes after we turned it off, but we didn't experience any real ""story"" that increased either our understanding or appreciation of this brilliant comic.",1282435200,10,1168,4.786069651741293

It stayed very true to Eddie, learned a lot about him in the early days! I'm so very glad he kept with it or we wouldn't have the one of a kind Eddie Izzard!!!!",1274659200,3,304,3.9193548387096775
5932155,4,B00439GE3G,"I've been a fan of British comedian Eddie Izzard for ten years now, ever since 'Dress to Kill' aired on HBO.  His humor is both ridiculous and intelligent at the same time.  When I vacationed in London with my family in 2000, I even picked up Eddie's autobiography.  Little did I know that the year I purchased that book, Eddie's career had just taken a down turn in the UK and he had stopped doing stand-up.  'Believe', a documentary by Susan Townsend, covers Eddie's return to stand-up with the SEXIE tour while also giving us a overview of his career.

Eddie's mother passed away from cancer when he was very young and he admits several times in the film that his career as a performer springs from wanting to get attention and be loved.  It includes clips of Eddie performing on the street with friends, his appearance at FRINGE comedy festival, and, of course, clips from his bigger productions from the late 90s.

This was extra fun for me to watch because I actually saw one of Eddie's ""workshop"" shows in New York when he was still working out the jokes in the SEXIE tour.  I then saw him again during the official run of the tour in Washington D.C. so I know first hand how he takes an idea and evolves it into a part of his show; it's a very organic process for him.

This movie, along with Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedian"", should be required viewing for anyone thinking of going into the stand-up career track, or even just entertainment.  If you're already a fan of Eddie Izzard, you MUST see this documentary. You really appreciate all the work and love he puts into his shows, and what a tenacious individual he is.  If you don't know much about Eddie, it's still an inspiring film to pick up and see someone struggle for and achieve their dream.",1273795200,9,1756,4.490566037735849
5932156,3,B00439GE3G,"If you like Eddie Izzard you  will find this interesting, but most of the material is the same and repeated.  My sons (13 & 15)really laugh and roll with Eddie's 'live shows', but were bored with this, it really is a biography and not a comedy show.  An adult would find the subtle message of 'not giving up' and 'taking chances'.",1271635200,3,330,4.377049180327869

I viewed this film twice after listening to the new ""Believe"" audiobook, which is also good. Long time fan of  Izzard's stand-up and acting, so this is a special look at how hard he struggled to overcome his learning dysfunction (and becoming multilingual), severe personal loss, career disappointments  and bravery in revealing to the public an 'alternative' sexuality and expression. Izzard is a complex man who had a strong, stable father figure and advocate, who helped him make something positive, lasting and enjoyable for a long time. How lucky we are to cross paths with him while we are alive together. I learned things I did not know; something all good documentaries accomplish. So, well done.",1498780800,3,796,5.0227272727272725
