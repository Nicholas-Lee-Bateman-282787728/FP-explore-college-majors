8174940,5,B000656DFU,I like travel movies and travelouges (there is a difference) so I picked up this title to see what a trip to South America might be like. It seems fun. The titles are heavy on Brazil and Bolivia but there are also clips and information about neighboring countries so you get a fairly well rounded view. Rio in Brazil looks like it is probably the most fun of any of the destinations and the beaches look amazing. I also like the church on the top of the hill. The information about the native americans in South America also entertained me.,1148428800,,540,4.41
