8399394,5,B003L4FW9Q,"Purchased this as a gift for a fellow Oasis fan but got the opportunity to watch it and was pleasantly surprised!  Even if you have seen every Oasis video, this DVD delivers a new twist on them as Noel narrates throughout, explaining what was happening at the time, why he hates making videos, etc.  The live tracks are great as well and showcase a diverse selection of songs from various periods.  All in all, a great DVD for the price!",1458691200,,437,4.4375
