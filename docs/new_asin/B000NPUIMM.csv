8180541,5,B000NPUIMM,"Updated August 9, 2008. Well, I have finally gotten this DVD and have had to re-write my review accordingly. One glaring error was my mention of 1981 (U of L won in 1980), but the rest is based on the quality of this release. This was arguably one of the best title games ever played. The action was almost non-stop, the score was close, both teams were loaded with great players, two of the game's best coaches were on the sidelines, and in the end both teams proved they belonged in the championship game. There were no 3-point shots yet and the game was much more competitive because of that. You couldn't stand at half court and win with long range bombs: you had to get in the trenches and play the other team face-to-face. This was a tense game to watch again even though I knew the outcome from having watched it on television while it was being played in '86. In fact, the game itself deserves a great big 5-star rating...sadly the packaging does not. I have no complaints with either the video or audio quality since they are completely on par with the other games I have bought in this series (the Indiana '76, '81, and '87 wins, Marquette's '77 win and UL's '80 win). Where this DVD suffers is in the commentary department. Or, more acurately, the lack-of-commentary department. The reality is: there is absolutely no pre-game, halftime, or post game commentary. I mean NONE...! You get the game and nothing else; not even the chance to see UL cut down the nets and receive the trophy. What a shameful way to treat a championship video! What a shameful way to treat a championship team! The game is there in its entirety from buzzer to buzzer, but was surgically cut at those points. Ironically, 'Mr. Commentary' himself, Jay Bilas, was on the floor in this game. In a nutshell, I'm giving a five to the game; but only a one to the production. Since this is probably the only DVD release there will ever be of this game I suggest you buy it. But, let your displeasure be known so that NCAA On Demand will be aware that basketball fans expect something better.",1197763200,,2070,4.493368700265252
8180542,3,B000NPUIMM,"I've gotten several of these NCAA On Demand DVDs and the quality is generally very good.  This one, however, leaves something to be desired.  The video looks like it is suffering from some type of weird compression (very staccato movement) and the audio is just poor.  I have a 20+ year-old VHS copy of this game that is much better, and that tape was bad enough to prompt me to buy this DVD ""upgrade"".  It's nice that the game is available, but this is not a high quality version.",1185062400,2,481,4.370786516853933
