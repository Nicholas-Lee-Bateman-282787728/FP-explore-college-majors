A reminder to slow down and be kind to one another.

5962422,3,B00F0ORGB2,"For a simple low-budget family film, A Christmas Tree Miracle comes surprisingly and tantalizingly close to being something noteworthy. While the production is simple and the acting limited, I really felt they were onto something. Specifically, there's a scene where the young George girl is talking to a peer who's living in a shelter. As she breaks down and weeps, the girl attempts to comfort her with levity. It's an effective piece of filmmaking and one of the few sequences I've seen dealing with teen homelessness. My attention was grabbed and I felt this had the potential to do something interesting with a sneaky critical issue, in a believable and humanizing way.

Unfortunately, the film peeled off, shifting its narrative towards the Georges taking up with an old man on a tree farm. For the purposes of a so-so family Christmas movie, I suppose this turn of events make sense. The father, thanks to a cup of coffee he unthinkingly gave to an old dude in a donut shop over a year ago, totally lucks into the sweetest deal ever and scores his own tree farm (but almost botches it, were not for yet another random act of kindness by another weird old man). Until this point, there's the opportunity to take a solid look at what homelessness means and perhaps what actions and choices can be made to put oneself on a path to stabilization. Instead, we get a bail-out storyline that would never ever happen to a real family.

Granted, A Christmas Tree Miracle is a movie, but its early tone appeared to keep the narrative wedded closely to what real events would look like. The turn to fantasy struck me as a weird, missed opportunity.

Nothing much happening with the DVD: a mid-grade 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, 2.0 Dolby Stereo track, and no extras.

5962442,1,B00F0ORGB2,"Beyond a reasonable doubt, this ""film"" is an absurd waste of time. First off, the dog in the poster isn't in the movie, secondly, who ever wrote this should be charged for crimes against humanity. This sad excuse for entertainment was shot in some hick-town for illiterate farmers to gawk over. Thirdly, this entire movie was stolen, beat for beat from a Christmas Story. Fourthly, that snotty teen girl must have been the only girl in the primitive village they shot this movie in because she is the worst part of this tire-fire. I think the people who made this movie are criminals and should be publicly humiliated.",1462752000,,618,4.731481481481482

Real life story turns into a heartwarming miracle ending, even with the one sad loss :(.  Although it has been said this was low budget, I didn't see anything to make ""low budget"" even cross my mind.

5962466,4,B00F0ORGB2,"We have a multi-generational family in our home and this is a movie we enjoyed watching together and will keep for our holiday collection. The storyline is about not believing in things that are based on materialism and acquiring, but on the intangibles: love, hope, and faith. A Christmas story told without the redundant Scrooge elements. At a time when movies are dark, demeaning, and dull, this one has light and warmth and reminds you of what really matters and how easily we slip into a comfortable lifestyle that can be gone in a snap. Yes, it has a miracle, duh, it says to expect that in the title.

I loved the little girl and her cello and the transformation of the teenage daughter who once demanded the latest fashions to finding something unexpected in the exact opposite.

It is a low-budget film that delivers a warm story portrayed by actors who feel more like you and me, rather than high-powered Hollywood types. Although movies like these frequently don't have the production values and distribution behind them, they are often better stories--because these have a message that makes us better--than the high-budget films Hollywood keeps vomiting out. I will take the low-budget with values over the hype and parading evil any day.

Disclosure: I know Kevin Sizemore, which is why I finally bought and watched this movie. However, I will keep this movie to watch again because I enjoyed it.",1418428800,7,1410,4.866666666666666

8611169,5,B00F0ORGB2,"I missed Christmas and it was a cold February night so I searched for a family Christmas movie to watch on amazon video. I thought this one would be a cheesy yet entertaining one but I was wrong. Story was actually pretty heavy at the beginning when the family was going through series of rough times. Its like a tv drama!  However, at the later part it started to get better and the feel good feeling kicked in. Wonderful messages were taught. Tear was shedded a little and plenty of smiles at the end of the film.

Love it!  Would definitely watch it again because I was watching it with my 6 year old (he loved it too) and ke kept asking questions on every scenes of the movie 

PS. Theres a dog on DVD cover. Did it come out when I went for a bathroom break?  I don't recall seeing one...hmmm. ",1517529600,,798,4.2105263157894735

8611171,5,B00F0ORGB2,Good family movie,1515974400,,17,5.0
8611172,3,B00F0ORGB2,"I'll be honest about this movie. The acting isn't great. The writing isn't really compelling. The characters never reach a true memorable depth, and there is a part in the movie I think they should have just stopped there and not gone overboard like they did. However... the family's descent is actually fairly realistic. It might be easy to cast stones at their behavior but they're really only a couple of notches above what I see fairly often, and they display some people right on. They really didn't commit any major crimes to deserve their punishment, but even at their worst, even when you might think this family deserves what they get, they show moments, hints of true character, actual heart. It's those moments that feel realer to me than the rest of the moment, and they're pretty short.

For a straight to TV movie with maybe a bit too obvious lessons to learn, and the fact it is warm and it is family friend, some people are really going to enjoy it. I watched it because it was on Prime, and I was curious. There are a lot of low key Christmas movies out there, and just not enough time to enjoy it. Slow night, warm cocoa, sit back and relax to just get a few smiles and a moment's reflect. It's worth it.",1513382400,,1222,4.431111111111111
8611173,2,B00F0ORGB2,"I realize this is for family viewing, thus sappy.  But really, it has awful acting, bad writing, and unrealistic sets.",1513123200,,118,4.9

8611176,2,B00F0ORGB2,"So, let's be honest, the family is terrible for the the first half of the movie.  I know this is supposed to be a movie with a great message, but it is hard to root for this family when they make such awful decisions.  Continuing the vacations, paying car loans, and living like they have a steady of income shows how delusional and self-centered these people are.  Again, I realize the point is to be a feel good story but their attitudes for the first 45 minutes are almost unforgivable.  Awful people who make terrible choices.",1505606400,,530,4.489583333333333
