8365571,4,B002DNLKHY,"While utilizing the same skeletal story as remake 'The Strawberry Blonde' (an excellent 1941 adaptation of James Hagan's play with Jimmy Cagney in the lead), 'One Sunday Afternoon' (1933) is a decidedly different-- though not entirely inferior-- film than its better-known successor.  Even with its substantially shorter running time, and hence its economized scenario, there is a depth to the earlier version-- due in large part to young Gary Cooper's moodier, arguably less sympathetic portrayal of Biff Grimes-- that is supplanted by musical interludes, colorful exposition and a lighter, thoroughly magnetic performance by Cagney in the later.  So as long as you go into OSA aware that it's more a drama than a comedy (Cooper does manage to charm a few laughs out of the part), it delivers a worthwhile hour and ten minutes.  3 1/2 stars.",1375401600,4,842,5.131386861313868
8365572,4,B002DNLKHY,I bought this for my husband because he had seen it on TV but wanted me to see it. He loves Gary Cooper and so do I.  I guess I would say it is quirky! Anything with Gary Cooper is good in my book.,1356652800,2,197,3.477272727272727

8365574,4,B002DNLKHY,"I'm rating the product here, not the wisdom of paying more than you would if you bought it directly from Warner Brothers. Not to mention that currently this film is sold in a bundle with five other Gary Cooper films for about ten dollars per film.

This is a DVD-R with no chapter stop and no restoration done on the film, although Warner Brothers must have done something to it at some point since it looks quite good for a 1933 Paramount film. Warner Brothers bought this film from Paramount when they decided to remake it as ""The Strawberry Blonde"" in the 1940's.

This film is much darker than ""The Strawberry Blonde"". Biff Grimes (Gary Cooper), aspiring dentist, has a bad temper, and really loves Virginia (Faye Wray). However when Hugo Barnstead (Neil Hamilton) elopes with her, he marries her friend Mary on the rebound and to save face. Hugo rises to the level of running the factory where Biff works and threatens to fire Biff if he doesn't spy on the other employees. In a face off with Hugo, Biff gets into a scrap with a cop and the cop's gun goes off, striking him in the leg. Biff goes to prison for two years and finishes his dental training through correspondence. Then ""one Sunday afternoon"" years later Biff encounters Hugo again when he needs to have a tooth extracted. Since he uses gas during such extractions, Biff sees an opportunity for paying Hugo back with murder.

Although this film plays out much like ""The Strawberry Blonde"" there are a few differences. ""The Strawberry Blonde"" was much lighter. Hugo Barnstead in that film was played by Jack Carson, who could always manage to inject just a bit of likeability into the cads he played. Cagney doesn't seem as angry in his rendition of Biff as Cooper does, and Cagney's Biff doesn't need to see what has become of his ideal woman (Virginia) years later in order to start appreciating his wife. Also, Cagney was innocent of any intentional wrongdoing in the crime that sent him to prison, where Cooper's Biff Grimes let his temper get the best of him in his downfall.

I would recommend this film and this product, just don't let some scalper make you pay more than Warner Brothers would.",1246060800,3,2167,4.635416666666667
