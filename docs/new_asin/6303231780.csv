This movie explores not only the basic fear of the unknown(s), but can also be a visual model of the human psyche: Two men representing Freud's Id, Ego, and Superego.  I can write a paper on that theme alone!  Waterston's portrayal of Royce is intense.  Potapov's acting, with or without dialogue, tore emotional responses from this viewer all through the movie.  Highly recommended!!",1044921600,,419,5.0144927536231885
7841429,5,6303231780,"This movie will hold your attention from start to finish! It must have been based on an actual account (but personally don't know that). Except for briefly at the start and again at the finish of the story, there are only two actors working here. The bond that develops between the injured, downed, Russian pilot and the American meteorologist rescuer (Sam Waterston) is based on the need for human contact and survival instinct.
Sam Waterson is so excellent in this leading role. When his character's discouragement gets to a low point; the blizzard closes off their fresh air supply; the food is about gone; the endless miles of slow, overland trek are days long; and his emotions give way, this viewer could almost feel the cold and hunger and tears. Their final rescue is charming and a relief!
What a movie! This is the kind of adventure that makes you feel your time was well spent for the viewing; your belief in ""goodness will out"" was renewed; and the sense that you were part of the intense story. You hope you would be as sacrificing for this helpless pilot as the American (Sam Waterston) was.
This is a movie you'll recommend to others, or loan it out and hope it's returned. It's one you'll bring out again! Hope you'll watch and enjoy this movie as much as we did!",1026518400,,1279,4.5895196506550215
