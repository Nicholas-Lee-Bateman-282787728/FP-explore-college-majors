I see such beauty it hurts at times, indeed the Mountains appear blue and smoky and mysterious in the distance the fall colours are perfect in colour contrast. The little surprises of wild animals are a treat, all helping to make you feel you are there. I just love it and fully recommend this dvd. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RNOQ90/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imghttp://",1344643200,,712,6.9222222222222225
8503629,5,B006RNOQ90,"I bought DVD because I love this part of the country, especially in the autumn.  The video was wonderful with the red, yellow and orange leaves in full color against a backdrop of the mountains and rivers of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina.  I enjoyed the wildlife shots also.  Very relaxing music also.  I've left it on for a couple hours straight because the music is enjoyable to listen to while I do my chores around the house.  Lovely.",1326585600,7,447,4.6075949367088604
