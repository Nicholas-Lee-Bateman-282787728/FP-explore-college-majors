3914324,5,B002DYJTVW,"There honestly has been no doubt about the success of Spongebob Squarepants, and the impact it has had on Nickelodeon, and its audiences. It not only has been the most successful cartoon they've developed since the days of Rugrats, but it also has domianted with everyone from young and old audiences of all kinds. But honestly, it is hard to believe that just this year it has celebrated its 10th Anniversary in the spotlight, and has became one of the most popular cartoon characters of all-time. With that success, Spongebob and all of his friends from Bikini Bottom, have shown not just fun and laughter, but a great feeling that has brought in more humor than we've seen from cartoon in a long time. Not only that, but Nickelodeon is really celebrating what has made Spongebob a true cartoon icon, with a compilation of what 100 Spongebobs would be like on one collaction.

Spongebob Squarepants: The First 100 Episodes brings in Spongebob Squarepants and his finest cuts from his first 5 seasons, to a whole new generation of fans young and old alike. The collection includes all of Spongebob's greatest highs and nautical humor with animation, and what it has brought out from him, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all of those great from Bikini Bottom at their best. All the 100 episodes have been remastered beautifully, and re-introduce Spongebob from top to bottom well, from guilty pleasures favorites like The Camping Episode, where Spongebob & Patrick are joined by Squidward reluctantly, who feels that Spongebob and Patrick are not fit enough to joing them with their camping ways, only to be later attacked by an underwater sea bear, and Dunces & Dragons (a spoof on the Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court), where Spongebob & Patrick acciodentally wind up in medevil times, to defeat Plankton, the one-eyed wizard from the heartbreak of Bikini Bottom's torture, and Chimps Ahoy, where Spongebob helps a heartbroken Sandy from fear of leaving Bikini Bottom from not deliveringa  knockout invention, by helping to design a new invention for Sandy's bosses, a bunch of chimps. Every short feels like a treat heart and soul, a great treat for anyone who has been a hard core Spongebob fan from young and old. All of them have been remastered nicely, but I do have one big gripe though. In the episode Just One Bite, where Squidward enters the Krusty Krab after closing, eagerly going to sneak a krabby patty, and feed his desire for loving krabby patties. Unfortunately, there was one major scene removed where Squidward, sneaks into the Krusty Krab, but gets hurt from Mr. Krabs security system, being burned from a gas explosion. This scene was also removed from the original launch from Just One Bite as well, but later shown for a brief time on Nickelodeon.

Still, overall, Spongebob Squarepants: The First 100 Episodes is a absolutely great delight for the hard core Spongebob fan, as well as for anyone who has not yet neven seen any of the great Spongebob cartoons from all the way back to 1999. It is absolutely a real must have for anyone who enjoys delightful, classic cartoons. I absolutely recommend this as a great reminder of how loveable the sponge from Bikini Bottom has captured our hearts.

-All bonus features from the first 5 season DVDs (Unconfirmed)
-Pilot Episode ""Help Wanted"" in regular and 7 Seas Edition
-Documentary ""SquareRoots"" in original, uncut widescreen format
-Animation Art Galleries
-Music Videos
-More to come!

It is unknown the status about the features labeled ""unconfirmed"", and what the disc break-up is going to be.  My guess is if it includes way more bonus features than listed, then it would be discs 1-10 are the episodes (half a season per disc) and 11-14 are bonus discs, but only time will tell.

There will be a setup menu on each disc with audio and visual options, and presumably captions, and the packaging will be a 3D-lenticular slipcase housed in plexiglass.  It sounds like a deal to me, and I'll be picking this up despite the fact I already own seasons 1-5 on DVD.",1248134400,149,4729,4.436133486766398
3914331,5,B002DYJTVW,Received the collection quicker than expected! This appears to be seasons 1-5. I haven't sat down to watch all the discs but there are 14 in all.

We have a parakeet and I always turn this on for her when we leave.  haha  From what I have watched, it is funny.  Thus, I ordered this set.  I got it today.  This is why I give it a 1.

The case that the discs comes in, was very worn.  Looks like it had been kicked around.  Then, the cases.  They are very cheap.  The little tabs, that hold the discs in, were falling out of the cases.  Bad for two reasons.  First, they could get under the discs and damage them.  Second, the discs can fall out of the cases when you open them and get damaged.

Upon looking at all the discs, which I suggest everyone does, when they get a set like this, I noticed that two discs were damaged.  I chatted with Amazon.  I then saw they have a newer release.  So, Amazon gave me a return label for the damaged set and I went and ordered the newer release.  From pictures I viewed, from another buyer, I have confidence that the discs will be in better shape.

Update:
I got free one day shipping on the new set I ordered.  It arrived today.  The way the case is set up, is much better than the first version of the release.  To show you how, I made a video.  I hope it is helpful to you.",1500681600,2,1584,5.145669291338582

3914372,3,B002DYJTVW,"I grew up watching Spongebob, though some will say ""obsessed"" was a much better word. I was excited to see they had something to fit my collection needs, because it's too expensive to purchase all of the seasons I would watch, plus I wasn't exactly sure when I stopped watching. I'd say I knew about 80 episodes on here by pure memory. I love that I have all the episodes I knew right here in one place!

I have a few negatives, though I would say one is just a preference. I wish this was on Blu-Ray, purely for the fact that they could fit so many more episodes per disc, and it wouldn't need to be a 14 disc set. (That's a lot of disc changing for binge watching!)

I'm not impressed with the quality of the plastic used to hold the discs into place. I have more than one case that has every prong that hold the discs in place broken, so the discs float around loosely, getting scratched in the process. (Photos provided!)
Other than that this is a great set for early lovers of Spongebob!",1488499200,,992,4.243386243386244
3914373,3,B002DYJTVW,"This box set is a lovely collection for any SpongeBob fan. In perfect working condition I would give it 5 stars. However, the one I received is slightly defective, with about half of the DVDs having cloudy splotches on them that do not wipe off with cleaning, causing the DVDs to skip and/or not play certain episodes. I bought the product new, so this definitely came as a surprise to me. A disappointment for sure, and I do not yet know the extent of the defects. On the first disc (which happens to be one of the ones with cloudy splotches), two of the eight episodes were unplayable. As I continue on with the set, I may decide to return for a refund if a large number of episodes are unplayable.

That goofy, little, derpy sponge and all his nautical friends. Even as a young lady now, I still enjoy watching Spongebob. Without cable TV, I turned to Netflix to watch all my favorite cartoons and Spongebob was on their streaming list for a time. Then, sadly, it removed the cartoon from Netflix. Then, I thought to myself, ""why not just buy them?"" Looked online individually and it was going to cost a fortune for each season/series. I found the first 100 episodes for a great value.

3914445,3,B002DYJTVW,"This is a great set. However, the packaging is horrendous on it. The little plastic clips which hold the disc in place break upon removal of said disc. Now I have to be extra careful putting them away.",1425168000,,201,4.315789473684211
3914446,5,B002DYJTVW,Great product.,1424822400,,14,6.5
3914447,5,B002DYJTVW,"When I saw this marked down, my heart stopped and I had to get it! What you are getting here are 14 discs of frolic and fun with your favorite childhood characters and the best episodes of the series. If you want to study wumbology and have campires underwater you will love this!  The older ones are the best ones in my opinion. If you are looking for solid entertainment that requires little to no critical thinking and hours of laughter then this is for you! Recommend for 90's kids who want great movie marathons with their fellow 90's kids. My mom has always hated this show in general for the ""absolute stupidity"" and said ""oh no"" when I excitedly whipped out this amazing box set. I also bought this for my friends birthday who will undoubtedly jump for joy when she opens it. As a college student, best money spent this semester.",1424476800,,837,4.470588235294118
3914448,5,B002DYJTVW,"I love SpongeBob, and in fact I already owned Seasons 1-5 as individual box sets.  I love that this collection takes up much less space on the shelf.  The discs come packaged in seven slim-cases, each with two discs inside.  They are a little difficult to remove, so you have to be careful.  The artwork on each slim-case each features a different character from the series.

Menus:
These are no nonsense collections, not loaded with advertising before you get to the menu.  I find the menus attractive and easy to navigate.  And they all fit the same style.  The menus are different than the individual season sets.  Based on another review, I had assumed the menus would not be animated, but they are.  And they each have different music too, for instance, the music on the disc-1 menu is an instrumental version of ""F-U-N"".

Video:
The episodes are laid out in a similar fashion as the season sets.  For instance, you get one SpongeBob theme song at the beginning of the disc, several episodes, and then a massive credits compilation at the end.  The episodes seem to be in chronological order.  The first episode ""Help Wanted"" does indeed include the Tiny Tim song.  The video and audio quality is excellent as you'd expect from DVD.

Extras:
The ""Square Roots"" special is outstanding!  I think it was 45 minutes long.  It features interview from all the major players in the series including the creator, the major voices, artists, writers, directors, the (then) head of Nickalodeon, animation historians (including Jerry Beck), and the general public.  The ""Seven Seas Edition of Help Wanted"" is nothing more than the same episode with different languages.

In short, this set is everything you'd want or expect in such a collection.  And it's a good bargain too.",1423785600,13,1769,4.83

He was so ecstatic to receive this as we are major Spongebob lovers, however it's hard to watch it since it no longer is available on Netflix. We've been watching these episodes for 2 days straight and surprisingly still can't get enough! The DVD set arrived right on time with Amazon Prime's 2-day shipping and was in great condition. All of the 7 separate cases contain 2 discs and a character for each case, which was very awesome! These 100 episodes contain all of the classics that any Spongebob lover would know by heart such as, ""Bubble Buddy"", ""Hooked"", ""F.U.N"", and many more!

3914547,4,B002DYJTVW,The whole package is a great deal and a must-have for any spongebob fan. The only thing that I didn't like is the packaging. It was a little bent but the biggest thing was the actual cases were very cheap and all the little prongs that hold the discs broke off when I opened the case for the first time. Not to nit pick but that's the only bad thing but other than that this in awesome!!!! Nothing wrong with the discs themselves,1405555200,,429,4.180722891566265
3914548,2,B002DYJTVW,"Im leaving my original review of the box set-which I really did like- but this is my displeasure of them re releasing the box set again instead of releasing the 2nd 100 episode box set.
SpongeBob is a guilty pleasure of mine- I'm extremely picky about the kind of shows I like to watch and this one just started to grow on me. I would wind up watching any cartoon that would catch my interest when there was nothing on TV and I stumbled across SpongeBob one day. With the first 100 episodes on this box set is a great enough reason to buy this instead of the separate seasons sets the crown gem on this is the documentary the explains how SpongeBob got his start and became the pop culture icon he is today. Once episode 200 airs I am hoping Nickelodeon does another 100 episode box set. There are still plenty of extra features they can add to it. Like A Mermaid Man tribute and how an episode is put together from start to finish. It is definitely something I would snag in a heartbeat",1405296000,2,987,4.283422459893048

Pros:
-Contains some really good bonus features like the Square Roots Documentary or Help Wanted: the Seven Seas Edition.
-Save some shelf space for the first five seasons
-Contains the original airing of the You Wish special where Patchy the Pirate showcased Shanghaied and the three alternate endings.
-All the episodes are in their production order
-You save money on buying the first five seasons with this box set

Cons:
-Most of the audio commentary from the first four seasons are missing, however, there is commentary for season five.
-This is just a nitpick from me and probably in the long run it would make the set more expensive, but there are no alternate language tracks",1394236800,2,735,4.7795275590551185

A few things, probably, but I'm not going to put them in a review.

The jewel cases aren't bad quality - I love that it shows one of the main characters on each one. With 100 episodes, you get double the stories (just as they are aired, you get 2/episode). We haven't even watched all of them, though I did check each disc - all is well. These are older - it's obvious with how easily they are scratched, but I don't mind that because we try to take care of the discs really well. I agree with another reviewer that I wish the theme played between each episode - that's one of my daughter's favorite parts - but it's not a deal breaker. Awesome way to get a lot of this series without having to buy each season separately.",1344211200,,803,4.1210191082802545

This'll make an awesome birthday or Christmas present for someone you know who's a SpongeBob fan & doesn't own every episode in it, or is longing to see the Square Roots documentary inside. When I got mine, it used to be $35, a whomping $30 to $65 cheaper than any other store or their websites. But now that I got my set, it's May 9th & it's priced even cheaper by nearly 2 bucks! No matter; it's a much better deal to get season sets than single-disc volumes, and even better still to get this set, especially at Amazon! Is there any way to refund the difference to me, between the day I bought it & today?

Each case has the episodes & a brief description on the inside, under the disc.  This makes it easy to navigate through the episodes.  One thing I love, and have not seen on other collections I have:  The opening theme plays before the first episode ONLY & not before each and every episode.  Love that!  I have other collections where the opening theme & credits play before and after each episode.  Annoying!  Someone commented the menus were difficult to navigate.  I thought the format was a bit different, but it really took no time to figure out.  I love the way the discs are put together.  Very nice presentation.  Each case has a different character featured on the front, with a coordinating color scheme.  Someone actually thought about the fans when putting this collection together!  It wasn't just thrown together, as an afterthought.  When I got my collection, it came with a hard, plastic, holographic card featuring Spongebob on the sleeve (image is the same as the regular cover).  Very nice!  My copy was purchased as new, but the sleeve was a bit dented/crushed on one edge, when I got it.  Mine came without any packing material, to keep it from moving around insid the shipping box.  A bit disappointing, but the box & DVDs inside were unharmed.  I am more concerned about the content.  Excellent buy!  A must have for Spongebob fans :)",1330646400,,1481,4.6038461538461535

When i opened the box, i realized already through the plastic foil that the spongebob dvd collection had a damaged look to it. Especially the edges of the box had a torn down appearance, almost like a ""used look"". The box should really be in better quality. I looked at each cd, and they were in good condition. No scratches or anything. But what upset me the most, was that every single cd case was damaged inside. I'm talking about the plastic button you have to press in order to take the cd out of the case. All of them were broken to a point, where the cd's don't have a hold, and they're basically lose in the case. I think the reason is  that they choose a slim cd case for 2 disc's. That causes the failure.
I'm a huge spongebob fan, and the episodes are funny. It's just sad that the whole pack comes in a poor quality.",1328832000,,907,4.182857142857143

Number of Discs: 14
Number of DVD Cases: 7

I won't list all the episodes since they have already been listed in the reviews. Anyway, I definitely recommend owning this set if you're a huge fan of SpongeBob! Or even if you're just starting to collect the DVD's. It saves a lot of shelf space compared to the seasoned sets. On the plus side, this set does include the ""Help Wanted"" episode (while the season 1 DVD set did not) and all the episodes are listed/played in the original airdate order. On the down side, the opening to the show is only played at the beginning of each disc. I prefer it to play at the beginning of each episode as they originally aired. The ""Just One Bite"" episode has sadly been edited. The scene when Squidward is exploded twice from the burglar alarm is removed. That's the only edit from this set that I've noticed so far. Overall: I definitely say yes to this set! A great show for kids and parents. :)",1325116800,,1564,4.575

I would say buy it if you don't already own seasons 1-5 (I already owned season 1 + some Spongebob dvds, but after owning this will give them to my younger cousins).

3914745,3,B002DYJTVW,"I already owned the first three seasons on DVD, but I bought this set for two reasons:

1. To save space

This set is just barely wider than either the first or second season boxsets, by about one thinpack DVD case at most. The third season is roughly half the width of either the first or second season boxsets. 'The First 100 Episodes' boxset takes up a little less than half the shelf space of Seasons 1-3 combined (and it also includes Seasons 4 and 5, but that's a moot point because they plain suck).

2. Because I'm a freak about keeping things in mint condition

This boxset at one point came in a plexiglass hardcase with nice bubble cutouts, and a lenticular 3D slipcover. I'm not sure if that was a limited first print run, or maybe it was exclusive to certain retailers, but the boxset I got from Amazon did NOT have a hardcase or a lenticular splicover. That was half the reason I ordered this set, I really wanted the hardcase because I'm obsessive-compulsive about keeping all my media in absolutely pristine condition. I handle my DVDs like they're glass babies, and I hate it when boxsets come in cardboard cases (especially digipacks, those are the worst). By the way, the cardboard shell on my set did arrive all wrinkled/creased along the bottom, with the corners all squished in. I know there are people out there like me that feel my pain on that one... so just be warned, if you were expecting a hardcase, there's a good chance that you won't get one if you order from Amazon. Go to a store and try to find one on the shelves.

Edit: I went to Best Buy to see if I could find a boxset with a plexi case and there weren't any. They had about four sets that were identical to the one I received from Amazon. Two Wal-Marts and a Target didn't even have it in stock.",1286064000,32,1785,4.364457831325301

Spongebob is goofy, silly and his laugh is ridiculous, and it just makes us love him more!  I am hoping to purchase this particular DVD set for the holiday season.  It's a must have for all Spongebob fans.

If you haven't tried Spongebob, if you love laughing at the ridiculous...then give this a try.  If you aren't sure about it, pop on Nickolodeon channel, there are always Spongebob episodes on everyday.

3914752,5,B002DYJTVW,"My 11 year old son is a BIG Spongebob fan/connoisseur who watches episodes over and over. This set was a must for him in his quest to own every Spongebob episode ever created. He calculated the cost per episode, ""There are really 200 episodes because there are two every 30 minutes"" and decided that this was terrific value for money!!",1264896000,2,335,4.6
3914753,5,B002DYJTVW,We had a ton of episodes saved on our DVR and decided to get this for our son for Christmas...he loves them. They arrived quickly and work perfectly. We watch them very frequently...definitely worth the money.,1264896000,2,209,4.833333333333333

3914755,5,B002DYJTVW,"If you have ever even heard of the Spongebob Squarepants name, I recommend that you purchase this amazing collection of the first 100 episodes. SBSP is one of the only cartoons to last the test of time and that is for a reason. This is a funny show that appeals to children as well as adults. I loved Spongebob from the first episode, and it only got better from there. There have been moments such as the FUN song and the Campfire Song that have made an already lovable show much more than lovable. From the first episode to the 100th episode, the quality of this show has been high. I recommend this collection to anyone, from the casual observer to the hardcore enthusiast. Spongebob Squarepants: The First 100 Episodes is worth every penny I paid for it.",1264204800,2,758,4.5
3914756,5,B002DYJTVW,I had no problem with this product but I also purchased The Brady Bunch complete series and the first cd is covered with glue and cannot be played. It was the way it was packaged. The rest they got the glue off of it wasn't enough to bother the playing. For the price of it the packaging was terrible and should be replaced.,1263686400,2,324,4.158730158730159
3914757,5,B002DYJTVW,I have four grandchildren from 2 years old to 16 years old and they all love SpongeBob. They were very excited to get this set for Christmas.  It's a good value for the money....there's over 30 hours of SpongeBob.,1263081600,,213,4.461538461538462

I looked up the chronilogical order and it doesn't go with some of the discs. Please let me know if anyone else has noticed this. That is the only complaint I have. Other than that, Spongebob is an awesome escape from the real world!",1262217600,,398,4.391891891891892

3914762,5,B002DYJTVW,"We own all of the original seasons (1-5) currently offered of SpongeBob SquarePants. We love them but they take up a lot of space and we constantly have the discs rotating throughout our house. We definitely will keep the originals but this set is just a little wider than the box of the 1st season set. Now when our son asks for a certain episode (which he does often) we can actually find it!

I just unpacked this item so I am not sure if discs 1-13 contain bonus features (other than commentaries).  There are no extras listed and I haven't found any other extras on the discs with episodes. Also, the menus aren't animated as elaborately as the originals. I prefer the original menus on the previous separate season releases; they are animated (moving pictures) as opposed to one static picture and it is easier to select the specific show that you want on the older version menus. Although, the new menus seem to load more quickly.

* I added some screenshots of the menu to the ""customer images"" section of this item's listing.

Disc 14 contains the following special features:

- Square Roots: The Story of SpongeBob SquarePants
- ""Help Wanted"": The Seven Seas Edition
- Life Lessons from Bikini Bottom
- Kick-Wham-Pow-Bob Music Video

My bottom line opinion: If you are a huge fan, get the original set AND this set -- now at amazon.com for $65. If you don't care about the space or price and want just one set - get the originals. If you have kids and a budget or you like to just ""play all"" of the episodes - I would recommend this one because it takes up so little space and the price is really good right now - a lot cheaper than if you bought all of the seasons separately.",1253836800,44,1687,4.44336569579288
