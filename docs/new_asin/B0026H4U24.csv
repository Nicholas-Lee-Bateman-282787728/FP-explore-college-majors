8352571,5,B0026H4U24,Picking Like Chet was very well written. It was easy to follow and play. I read so the only time that I use tablature is when I am not sure where the arranger wanted the note to be played. Tab is useful in that respect.,1378684800,,219,3.888888888888889
8352572,5,B0026H4U24,"This DVD lesson is exceptional in many ways. There are only a few instructional DVDs out there that teach the style of Chet Atkins, and those that do tend to teach only public domain music. Presumably this is to avoid the hassle of sorting out all the legal paperwork involved with copyright issues and the like. Not so this DVD produced by Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop. It contains some of Chet's best known classics (Rose Ann, Down Home, Somebody's Knockin, Trambone, Drive In and Alice Blue Gown).

Pat Kirtley is a fantastic guitar player who won the National Fingerstyle Guitar Championship in the Walnut Valley Festival competition in 1995. He has been a longtime endorser of Taylor Guitars, so he uses a Taylor T5 for this DVD. A Gretsch Country Gentleman or some other Chet Atkins model made by Gretsch might have been more appropriate for this purpose, especially since the Taylor T5 lacks a Bigsby-tailpiece which, however, is essential to the sound of many of Chet's early hits.

Pat Kirtley really mastered the style of Chet Atkins. He presents a wealth of information on how to produce the sound that Chet got. Each song is being taught according to the same pattern: First, there is a full-fledged performance version of the tune (sometimes at breathtaking speed), then Kirtley goes step by step through the arrangement explaining what to look out for. Lastly, there is a split-screen version of each tune where he plays the arrangement in slow speed. It has to be noted, however, that Kirtley took a little liberty with the arrangements. Those are not note-for-note transcriptions of what Chet actually played. Occasionally, Kirtley somewhat simplified the arrangements, perhaps to make them more accessable to us regular guitar players. But in no way are those dumbed-down versions, quite on the contrary. One tune was recorded as a duet between Chet and Lenny Breau, the great Canadian Jazz virtuoso (Somebody's knockin'), so Kirtley had to modify it considerably in order to make it a stand-alone guitar piece. Alice Blue Gown was recorded two different times by Chet; Kirtley kind of blended the two versions together.

The DVD comes with a very accurate booklet that contains all the tabs for the split-screen versions. Please note that Kirtley plays ""Ready For The Times To Get Better"" while the end credits roll. Unfortunately, this fine performance is not included in the tab booklet. However, Kirtley taught this song on his DVD ""Introduction to Thumbstyle Guitar"". A tab of ""Ready For The Times To Get Better"" can be found there.

As a bonus, Stefan Grossman included some rare footage of Chet Atkins performing a couple of his lesser known tunes. While not unreleased material (it was already available on the DVD ""Chet Atkins - Rare Performances 1955-75""), it is always good to see the master himself.

This DVD - together with its predecessor Vol. 1 - will be an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to delve into the style of Chet Atkins and will give the motivated student material to work on for months (or even years).",1370390400,2,3055,4.924271844660194
