8468625,5,B005ELVSW4,"This is the best dance video I have seen, The Music is excellent and the breakdown of routines is extremely helpful.
I wish more DVD's were like this one. Great value for the money, almost 2 full hours.",1354233600,2,202,4.342105263157895
8468626,5,B005ELVSW4,"I met Tempest at Tribal Revolution Bellydancing Festival in June. I was not a bellydancer and was there as a vendor.  After watching Tempest perform, I was awestruck.  She both terrified me and inspired me to begin dancing. I have begun. We have been meeting every other morning, Tempest and I. Of course, she shows up via dvd, but still, she shows up. My ass is smaller, my hips are all wiggley and I feel sexier. I highly recommend both this product and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-for-the-Beautiful-Freaks/dp/B000GJ26G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance for the Beautiful Freaks</a>.

PS - She still terrifies me. In a good way.",1348012800,6,693,5.91
8468627,1,B005ELVSW4,Initially I was excited to receive this DVD given her take on art nouveau belly dance. However I was very disappointed upon watching this DVD for the first time. So much so that I watched it once and have not bothered to put it on again. The movements were poorly broken down and executed. The music she was dancing to was not the music I was hearing. Beginner dancers who think this is a good representation of gothic belly dance will doubtless pick up bad technique.  I would not recommend this DVD to anybody.,1346544000,3,512,4.446808510638298
8468628,4,B005ELVSW4,"The dvd is very enjoyable. Tempest is a great teacher. I especially enjoyed her vintage dance moves. The problem is the fact her dvd won't play in the vcr in my living room, but it will play on the portable player. I've had similar problem with other dvds.",1327968000,2,256,4.354166666666667
8468629,5,B005ELVSW4,"Five stars all around. Music, artistry, videography, clear and concise instruction, useful drills, and many cute & sassy, steampunky combos to add to one's fusion repertoire. Miles and miles beyond her first DVD, which I didn't particularly care for. However, Tempest has evolved greatly as an artist since then, and has obviously been doing her homework. I love her charming, retro ""Nouveau Noir"" style and I would recommend this DVD for any fusion dancer's library. Cheers to Tempest!",1323907200,5,486,5.243589743589744
8468630,5,B005ELVSW4,"I'd tried bellydance DVDs before, and had found it a frustrating experience.  I'm uncoordinated and not very flexible, so just diving in and doing even beginner moves is difficult for me.  Tempest, though, makes the art form much more approachable.  She encourages you to focus on how moves feel, rather than just how they look, and breaks them down into bite-size components that make sense even to an untrained dancer like myself.  The DVD is a great workout, but is less difficult on a conceptual level than I expected it to be.

Nathaniel Johnstone (of Abney Park)'s music is a wonderful addition to the DVD.  He and the rest of the Nathaniel Johnstone Band clearly have a strong love for bellydance and for music, and the soundtrack is grounding, uplifting, playful, moving and fun.

As a bellydance beginner I'm finding that this DVD provides a good foundation, but it's clear that dancers with all levels of experience would find it helpful.  Tempest teaches some moves I'd not seen before, and also discusses costuming, the process of developing a performance, and ways to connect to the dance on an increasingly deeper level.  I'm loving this DVD, and highly recommend it!",1312761600,7,1181,4.894472361809045
8468631,5,B005ELVSW4,"Tempest is one of the most original and vibrant voices in bellydance fusion scene.  Mixing the traditional with her own stylish accents of the Roaring '20's, Art Noveau, and Steampunk, this DVD will provide you with lots of wonderful new twists on movement for your bellydance vocabulary!

In addition to her wonderful combinations, there is an excellent warm-up routine and foundation flow that will help you think about your dance from a whole body standpoint.

The DVD also features an awesome soundtrack by Nathaniel Johnstone of Abney Park and two beautiful performances by Tempest to his music.",1312416000,5,600,5.164948453608248
