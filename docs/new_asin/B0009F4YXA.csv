8159768,5,B0009F4YXA,"The best part of this DVD, by far, was seeing the World Trade Center being built. If only they were still standing.

I'm a New Yorker, so I may be biased, but I liked seeing the history of my city and how it came to be what it is today.

Seeing the old neighborhoods before skyscrapers started dominating the skyline was very cool and I enjoyed how the films took me slowly from turn of the century New York to the modern city we see today.

Some of the older footage may be a little grainy, but I would expect that of 85 year old film stock.

This is a good collection of history of the Big Apple.",1146009600,2,598,4.0423728813559325
