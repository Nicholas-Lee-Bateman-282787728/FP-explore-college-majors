Nobody in this world is who they say ! Look for  several twists and turns as the Joes must find their way back home! It 's  possibly one of my favorite of the series along with the following titles i  wish  Sunbow would release in the future! They are ""G.I Joe:The Revenge  Of Corbra"",""G.I Joe:The Pryamid Of Darkness""  and of course  the orginal episodes dealing with Conbra's Mass Device! This vidoe is a  must for fans of the series!",954115200,6,601,4.4
