8597783,5,B00DU4TEAU,"Harry Drew is a thoughtful, thorough, and serious researcher, who has spent the time to do this kind of work right.  He has made sure that his data is correct before bringing a conference presentation or releasing information about the Kingman incident.  This DVD is well-worth the time and money if you are interested in an other-than-Roswell investigation.  It's refreshing to see someone with solid academic credentials present this high caliber investigative report.  Highly recommended.",1512345600,,491,5.506666666666667
