""What makes our time so different than the past is that we've never had 7 billion people living on the planet.  50% of the surface of our planet is in the tropics and 70% [about 5 billion] of those people live in the tropics.  And so the impacts on people will be felt most severely here in the tropical regions.

In the worst case [scenario], if we melt all [the glacial] ice on the planet, sea level will rise 70 meters [about 230 feet].

The world will not look like it looks like today.  The impacts on people having to migrate to find places to live will be tremendous.""

The above is said by one of the commenters in this beautifully-filmed documentary.  It has no narration but is purely comment-driven.

A glacier is a body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight.  It forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its melting over many years (usually centuries).  Glaciers are found in mountain ranges on every continent (except Australia).  Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth.

This documentary is a journey along the spine of the Andes Mountain Range in South America.  We start in Columbia, then go to Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and end in Argentina.

Along the way, we get to know the indigenous people and lives of those (especially farmers) who are affected by the dwindling tropical glacial reserve.  (The dwindling glacial reserve is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for climate change and global warming.)

We are accompanied by scientists (geologists, climatologists, glaciologists, etc.) who give us a perspective on what is happening in the natural world and what we can expect.

And from that, the greatest thing we learn is of the chain reaction effect that these disappearing glaciers are having on us and the rest of the world.

This film has comments from over fifty environmentalists, activists, and scientists.  It features Lonnie Thompson, ""Time"" magazine's ""Hero of the Environment.""

Finally, this documentary is the ""official selection"" of many film festivals.

In conclusion, this is a beautifully-filmed documentary that educates the viewer about an alarming ugly fact: the dwindling glacial reserve in the Andes Mountain Range of South America.

It also shows how painstaking are the scientists who gather this data and how certain they are that the glaciers of South America already are doomed to melt.  A thoughtful and important film.",1418083200,3,331,4.593220338983051

This is a fascinating, eye-opening and frightening account of the consequences of global warming and climate change. The DVD release contains 2 discs. Disc 1 is the actual documentary and chronicles the evidence of retreating glaciers in the South American countries of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Disc 2 contains more in-depth interviews and apparently edited scenes from the documentary.

This documentary hits me on several levels. Primariy the shocking evidence of how quickly the glaciers in the South American mountains have been retreating the last few decades. The impact is becomming profound. The micro-climates that occur because of the proximity to glaciers has been changing and as a result of the receding glaciers, a cascade of effects is being observed. This tale is told not through the voice of scientists, but primarily through the voice of farmers and people living in these areas. You can see their fear and hear the melancholy in their voices as they discuss what has been happening and what looms in the coming years.

The mountainous scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. I saw for the first time areas of South America that I had never seen before. I observed, in what felt like a very personal and raw way, how the people live, work and exist. They explained how the retreating glaciers is changing the way of life and actually instilling fear in them as far as what the future will bring. With less water to drink and less water available for to crops and animals, living in these areas will eventually become difficult if not nearly impossible. Reduced crop production will impact their lives locally as well as globally. Reduced coffee production along with reduced quality of crop will raise prices for consumers and reduce income for the small family producers. Tourism will suffer. The implications are staggering.

People will continue to argue whether global warming is real or imagined. After watching this DVD you will gain a more complete understanding of what is happening and will be able to reach your own conclusion.

I feel this is an important film that needs to be seen by as many people as possible but particularly middle and high school students who will be the next generation most impacted by the coming implications of climate change.

The experience of viewing this was very affecting.

My only complaint is that the sub-titles were very distracting and tedious. I think it would have been a better movie had the sub-titles been reduced to a minimum and to have had voice-overs do most of the translating in English.",1407715200,3,2699,5.024608501118569
