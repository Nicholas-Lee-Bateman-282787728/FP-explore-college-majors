3872367,2,B0028ERBSA,"Was not impressed at all with this.  Patrick Stewart was nowhere to be found (not the narrator) and the DVD itself was sloppily cobbled together from what seemed to be bits and pieces of episodic TV.  It was easy to tell where the commercial breaks had been and the continuity was poor (often the section that followed the ""break"" wasn't even related to the section that preceded it).  I can't imagine how this could possibly have garnered 4+ star reviews.  I wonder if the DVD I got was different than what others reviewed?",1440374400,,524,4.602150537634409

Picard (Sir Patrick Stewart) to the Centre of Our Planet and discover Layer-After-Layer the magnificence of below. Fossils, Crystals, Caves, Water, Oil, Solid Rocks, Molten Rocks and a very active Core. Each step tells you where, how the information to build this Image was obtained, from Oil Wells, Underground water, Mines and Caves. Very Intriguing and Educations.",1438387200,,444,5.267605633802817

3872382,5,B0028ERBSA,I've used these videos as a teaching tool for 6th grade and up.  They do an outstanding job of showing layers of the earth and plate tectonics as they really bring this material to life.,1423008000,,186,4.314285714285714
3872383,4,B0028ERBSA,Not bad.,1422403200,,8,3.5

3872385,5,B0028ERBSA,Everyone should see this!,1413936000,,25,5.5
3872386,3,B0028ERBSA,It was damaged - so i can't watch the end.  It glitches about 3/4 of the way through it there seems to be a manufactured blip on the dvd.  I noticed it 2 days after the 30 day warranty.  Freaking BS.,1411862400,,199,3.8048780487804876

3872400,5,B0028ERBSA,It is so hard to explain  concepts a'o but processes within the earth to middle schools but this does it very well without being condescending as most middle school educational videos are,1402099200,,187,4.84375
3872401,5,B0028ERBSA,"Although Patrick Stewart is not the narrator on this dvd, it is very good. He IS the narrator on a special included in the same disc...it is also very good.",1398988800,,156,4.233333333333333
3872402,5,B0028ERBSA,I loved this dvd.  I received in the time specified and in perfect condition.  Was easy to understand and the graphics were outstanding.  I would really recommend to anyone.  It definitely helps one put things in perspective. Marvelous.,1395187200,,236,5.131578947368421
3872403,5,B0028ERBSA,"My students learned so much from this video. It is a bit long and took 2 days to watch, but it explains core vocabulary and concepts with fantastic graphics and computer simulations that generated tons of student questions and interest. Well worth the cost and good for generating common core video and informational text comparison and contrast activities.",1392508800,,357,5.172413793103448
3872404,5,B0028ERBSA,Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I teach Geography and it holds their attention while they learn!,1392422400,,111,4.5
3872405,5,B0028ERBSA,"This video is more than awesome! The title feature: Inside Planet Earth is outstanding in its very informative content. However, the bonus feature: Amazing Earth is as good or even better. It is definitely a case of getting 2 for the price of 1, and then some. Worth every penny.",1386547200,6,279,4.6
3872406,5,B0028ERBSA,Fascinating adventure as to how we got here and what may be the future. The inner workings of the earth. Good earth science stuff.,1385683200,4,130,4.458333333333333
3872407,5,B0028ERBSA,"I used this in my 7th grade science class for several years. After 22 years of teaching I retired in June of 2013, but I passed it on to my buddy teacher.",1383782400,,154,3.84375
3872408,5,B0028ERBSA,"I like this film because I use it in my science class that I teach for international students and it has subtitles, good graphical representations of the interior of the planet, the narrator speaks clearly and it hits each of the important parts of inside Earth.",1378598400,,262,4.717391304347826
3872409,5,B0028ERBSA,This is a GREAT product. I'm looking forward to watching it again and again. I usually only purchase edcuational DVD's with 4 star or more reviews. This was one of them and you will be happy to have it in your DVD library.,1375833600,,222,4.186046511627907
3872420,4,B0028ERBSA,Very interesting facts to tell us about the core of this earth as they know it.  Very informative and interesting to watch.,1374105600,,123,4.590909090909091
3872421,5,B0028ERBSA,"If you are as interested in the origins of our planet as I am, this is the DVD for you.  You get a scientific and proven demonstration of the creation of the planet Earth (as well as the others) when our Sun took its place in the Milky Way Galaxy some 4.5 billion years ago.  Inside Planet Earth brings the history of the planet down to today.  Great to know just how special we are and that God placed us in the perfect place around a perfectly sized star in order to be alive and enjoy the gift of this marvelous place we call home.  Great DVD and another good buy from Amazon.com.",1358467200,,583,4.132743362831858
3872422,3,B0028ERBSA,"This could have done with a little more planning and a little more science.  I had hoped to use it for a high school earth class, and I did, but with some reluctance.",1354752000,2,166,4.03030303030303
3872423,5,B0028ERBSA,This hit the spot for my geography class.  We learned so much about current knowledge and new theories.  It made my students think.,1351728000,,131,4.6521739130434785
3872424,5,B0028ERBSA,"I purchased this for my 5 year old son who is fascinated by science. He sat and watched the whole thing and was impressed. It's a very easy to understand film, with great graphics, interviews, discussions, and science models. I learned a lot myself; fascinating things about the planet.

Recommended to all; no age limit. Great buy.",1351123200,6,332,4.824561403508772
3872425,5,B0028ERBSA,Quick and easy. Gave as a Christmas gift. Enjoyed very much. Recipient is a middle school science teacher. Said he couldn't wait to take and show to his class.,1325548800,,159,4.517241379310345
3872426,5,B0028ERBSA,"I teach science to 2nd-  through 5th-graders, and my students absolutely love this video.  We use it for our units on tectonic plates, earth's geologic history, the origin of life, and also in our unit on magnetism & electricity.  It has excellent simulations showing the formation of our solar system, convection currents in the magma that cause the plates to move, the swirling towers in the Earth's core that create our magnetic field, how the magnetic field protects us from the solar wind, the possible origins of life on earth, extreme-o-philes surviving near volcanic vents, and much more good stuff.  Patrick Stewart makes a good narrator.",1322784000,19,647,5.0754716981132075
3872427,5,B0028ERBSA,"I teach Introductory Geology and Earth Science and am always on the lookout for movies for class.  I think this is a good intro for my Geo class.  It gives a good overview of the Earth's layers starting all the way from what gravity does for life all the way to the core.  The presentation uses excellent graphics while the topics are interesting.  I would say this doesn't go in depth on anything and in reality it is a little cursory but it does seem to keep the students attention with interesting little details like amphibians were once the largest predator and the size of alligators.  I show particularly for that reason.  I'm trying to hook the students interest from the start and this seems to grab some of the borderline students.  So if you are looking for a well done, entertaining but also enlightening video on the Earth's internal structure, I recommend this.",1293062400,75,875,4.642857142857143
3872428,5,B0028ERBSA,"I have to say; when it came to understanding and researching the center of the Earth and the planet's contstruction for my novel, this show covered it well. The extra feature, Inside The Volcano, was a perfect bonus, (although the bonus is rather long and not as well paced owing to the time it was made).

I should point out that Patrick Steward IS on this DVD--he is in the bonus feature documentary, Inside The Volcano, produced about 1996. He is there, but not in the main feature. That's where the confusion comes from. I own it, and I recognized his voice.

Good stuff overall :)",1281312000,24,585,4.509433962264151
3872429,3,B0028ERBSA,"We watched half of this last night and Patrick Stewart's voice has yet to make an appearance. Great visuals and lots of scientific theory and good information, but no Patrick Stewart!",1266537600,7,183,4.935483870967742
8356088,5,B0028ERBSA,Use it with my students and it always starts discussions.,1523491200,,57,4.8
8356089,4,B0028ERBSA,"The feature was good, but the special features were even better!",1508025600,,64,4.909090909090909
8356090,4,B0028ERBSA,Got what I expected. Would buy again.,1500508800,,37,4.428571428571429

8356092,5,B0028ERBSA,Educational with splendid visional quality.,1485475200,,43,7.8
8356093,2,B0028ERBSA,I purchased this video thinking that Discovery puts out great stuff.  I would have liked to have wathed the whole video but I could not.  The backround music (if you want to call it that) was so loud and intrusive the narrative wa spoiled.  People watch science to learn science.  It is unnecessary to have low quality/loud audio drama to it.,1472342400,,342,4.557377049180328
8356094,4,B0028ERBSA,ok but not what I wanted on plates,1469232000,,34,3.375
8356095,5,B0028ERBSA,Outstanding explanations and illustrations.  Also clearly explains how scientists arrived at their conclusions.,1461801600,,111,7.538461538461538
8356096,5,B0028ERBSA,"Great narration, excellent graphics and computer simulations, along with real video.  The explanations and theories are thoughtfully enhanced and made clear by way of the computer generated graphics.  This presentation will captivate you and inform you at the same time.  It leaves you wanting more.",1457654400,,299,5.6
8356097,5,B0028ERBSA,"This film covers the planet from top down. Starts with crust, tectonic plates, mountains and Volcanos, etc. Yellowstone Park is just a volcano crater 25 miles across!

Moves down to the mantle, explains it is like fudge, slowly stretching and moving the tectonic plates. Shows the ocean plates diving into the mantle, all the way to the core! They send water with them, which causes volcanos. Says that there is much more water in the mantle than  in all the oceans. If all the water was on the surface, would cover the mountains!

 Shows researchers visiting the Lizard Islands in England where mantle rock is on the surface.

Covers the outer core of molten iron. This swirles and imparts motion to the mantle, creates earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.

Includes the deep iron core. Hot as the surface of the sun. Produces the magnetic field that protects earth and atmosphere from solar radiation. Relates that many astronauts develop cataracts, evidently from solar particles damaging their eyes. I thought the graphic reproducing the interaction of the magnetic field was outstanding. Connects the aurora and the compass. Provides one idea of how the magnetic field is generated in the core. This maybe from tubes of molten iron that create helical structures from the earths rotation. Facinating!

All of these sections are done with excellent computer graphics. Spends enough time on each part to capture idea without being repetitive.

Watched with my ten year old grandson. We both enjoyed it.",1450828800,5,1497,5.081632653061225
