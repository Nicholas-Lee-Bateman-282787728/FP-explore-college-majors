8246868,5,B0012MD8R2,"TESTIMONIAL Dear Anna,

I am a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner. I wanted to let you know that I think you truly have performed a great service to all women by creating the workout Indeprime (& RootLock). I also commend you for be daring enough to address the ""taboo"" subject of incontinence.

While most think that it is the middle-aged or elderly female that deal with incontinence, I have had patients as young as the early 20s have incontinence issues (usually an after-effect of childbearing).

As a good number of women prefer to avoid surgical intervention
(which sometimes is only temporarily effective), I have encouraged my
patients to perform kegel exercises with the use of a vaginal weight or
cone to treat incontinence. However, although I provide a print-out with
instructions, most of still wary of using the vaginal weight or cone as it seems unfamilar to most.

I recently printed out information on Indeprime (also applicable to RootLock) and gave it to a patient who was especially nervous about performing kegels with a vaginal cone/weight. She exclaimed in surprise, ""There is actually an exercise video that addresses this?"" Her nervousness immediately disappeared and she stated, ""Now I feel much more confident about these exercises being effective knowing that there is a entire video to follow"".

As I health care provider, I am very happy that you have given women who
deal with incontinence another avenue of treating this problem. It definitely enables women to regain their confidence & dignity, as well as the feeling of youth & health.

Thank you for this amazing contribution not only to the fitness area, but to Women's Health.

Sincerely, Workout Partner TC",1200355200,6,1694,5.071942446043166
