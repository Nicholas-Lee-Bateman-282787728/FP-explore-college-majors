8444295,1,B004W2O27E,"If you bought US Version Season 2 - then don't invest in UK version Series Three Region 2 discs.  The word Series versus the word Season confuses everybody.  Amazon won't make the distinction because they are more interested in selling you the DVD.  The episodes in Series Three UK Region 2 are identical to Season Two US.  Amazon doesn't provide much help in divulging episode titles on their product descriptions either.  If you like Law and Order UK, then wait until the release date for Law and Order UK Season Three.

I love the characters and plot in both US Seasons One and Two.  The stories are real and it translates well onto the streets of London.

Like I said - wait for US Season Three.",1331769600,25,699,4.492063492063492
8444296,5,B004W2O27E,"Law and Order UK is sourced from the long running American series. As in series 1 and 2, the US episodes were screened for plots which would translate effectively into a UK setting. Personally, although I must have seen all the US series over the years, I only got the occasional feeling of familiarity and this really did not spoil my enjoyment. It is not usual to see an American series adapted for the UK, though there have been plenty of ideas going in the other direction across the pond. Hence although I do not see any good reason why original UK scripts were not commissioned, I do not think the result has suffered because of this.

This time round we have 7 more episodes to go with the 13 from the previous two series, a fourth series has just finished viewing on TV and two more series have been commissioned. Although originally intended as a single series, clearly this one will run and run . The stories are typically gritty and absorbing and marked by a determination to go after the bad guys, often pushing the boundaries of legality in the process. The first part of the episode features the crime and the apprehension and charging of the suspect, and the rest involves the court case and eventual outcome. The main focus is in solving the crimes and getting the conviction so we do not get a lot of personal detail about the characters. If, like me, you enjoyed the earlier series, then this DVD set is not going to disappoint.

Please be aware that this is Series 3 UK.  In the US, this would be Season 2, Part 1.",1310601600,11,1533,4.448398576512456
