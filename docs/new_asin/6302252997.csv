8316143,3,6302252997,"This is an odd little relic of the VHS age. Produced by 3-G Home Video in association with the International Creative Exchange, this 3-tape (or ""Dossier"") set has three or four generic segments it repeats tape-to-tape leaving little room for actual revelations in the remaining 25 minutes or so.

Although I did learn about Hoover's strange obsession with stars like Elvis Presley, the main purpose of this needlessly large set seems to be to encourage the viewer to write to the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act and request their own FBI files. Since the purportedly included form is not in my set I can only assume that my late grandmother (the previous owner of this boon to the paranoid conservative) sent away for hers.

If there is a VHS museum out there, this set definitely belongs there. Quite a curiosity.",1282176000,,823,4.788732394366197
