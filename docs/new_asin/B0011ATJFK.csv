The first 20 minutes of the film are so bad I almost stopped watching.  As stated in the Wikipedia entry it was the most expensive Dutch film produced at the time (1975), its hard to see where the money went, the sound track is appalling with a very ordinary tune used over and over.  I suppose creativity becomes stilted when an important person is the subject.  Maybe the Dutch version is a little better.

The director Paul Verhoeven went on to do Hollywood blockbusters such as Robocop and Basic Instinct.  The lead actress Monique van de Ven does full nudity, she is attractive if a bit bony, but really carries it with an infectious personality.  She is one of those actresses that starts off doing virtual porn and ends up with a respectable career.  She has a list of film credits as long as your arm and was still working only a few years ago.  Apparently the earlier film ""Turkish Delight"" she starred in, also directed by Verhoeven is more pornographic, although this film is not.  Turkish Delight was voted the best Dutch film of the century apparently.

Anyhow as the film develops it becomes more watchable, although it still drags a bit here and there.  I'd give it a generous eight out of ten, but given the significance of the real story behind it, its a pretty poor effort.  It is really a succession of vignettes rather than a contiguous story.  I was wondering was it a morality tale about prostitution?  It seemed to have all the usual justifications, everyone else in the film seemed to do it and not have a problem with it except the wondering lead actress.  In the real world people survive poverty without losing their morals, and perhaps because they don't.  More often losing your morals leads to eventual failure if brief initial success.  However socialist propaganda would ignore that point.

There also seemed to be a theme of poverty being freedom, and an independent spirit that is not crushed by the down side of life.  But the theme goes nowhere.  Instead at the end she becomes a socialist and then marries into wealth.  In fact going back to the real story the books of her life acted to propel the socialist cause so she was hardly a hypocrite.

The film is worth a look if only as an introduction to a bigger story than it is capable of portraying, and also for students of film an early work of a significant director and actors.",1253750400,,2668,4.566315789473684
3063777,3,B0011ATJFK,"This 1975 film made by Paul Verhoeven in the Netherlands, stars the genuinely beautiful Monique van de Ven as Keetje (Katie) Tippel, a poor girl who moves from rural Holland to Amsterdam with her awful family in search of a better life. She goes through various awful jobs, gets to pose as a model for Rembrandt, and sinks to participate in the world's oldest profession before catching the eye of Rutger Hauer as the loathsome banker Hugo. After participating in a violent demonstration she finds love with the son of a socialite, but the film ends at that point, so it really stands as an exploration of her struggle to reach the goal of love, leaving the rest of her life to be dealt with in a title card at the end of the film.

The film is generally well made, and excels at showing the squalid conditions that newcomers had to deal with in Amsterdam at that time. The acting is rather good, with van de Ven turning in an excellent performance, and Hauer excelling (as always) as the creepy male lead. The film's primary weakness is its excessive length: while 105 minutes isn't necessarily too long for a feature, there are long drawn out scenes designed to provide atmosphere which contribute little other than running time.

I would love to see more of van de Ven's work, and while I do have reservations about the pacing, the film is worth a look. As an aside, the film apparently comes in several different lengths, I can only address the version I saw, but apparently there is a racier version as well that had to be cut substantially to avoid an X rating.",1220140800,5,1567,4.53356890459364

8241168,3,B0011ATJFK,"Based on the true life of Cornelia Hubertina (Neel) Doff (Monique van de Ven) born into poverty and worked her way into the gentry class as a model for famous Dutch artists at the turn of the century...and that prostitution thing. Her work as an author for the working class is left as an end note in the film.

I watched the film as part of a 50 DVD collection. The restoration wasn't there and the dubbing left much to be desired. Katie has a passion for life and wrote about her poverty as an autobiography. We see her posing for the art world, but even that was glanced over as they crammed her life into 100 minutes. It is worth a watch from an historical perspective, but the film is not overly entertaining.
