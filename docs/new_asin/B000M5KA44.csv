2725705,5,B000M5KA44,"I was reading 'Hitchcock' by Truffaut and I realised that I didn't know the early days of Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. Now, with this edition I have the opportunity to see the movies after reading the chapter about each film.
A excellent edition with a fantastic price.
Don't miss it!",1193443200,5,277,4.673469387755102
2725706,4,B000M5KA44,"With the notable exception of ""Murder!"" (1930) and several not-yet-released titles, this 2007 set from St. Clair has virtually all the British output from Mr. Hitchcock. Compared to the out-of-print Laserlight collection from 1999 (which did include ""Murder!""), this set adds ""Juno and the Paycock"" and the hard to find ""Champagne"".

For anyone wanting to watch the films in chronological order, these dates are from IMDd:

* The Lodger (1927)
* The Ring (1927)
* Easy Virtue (1927)
* The Farmer's Wife (1928)
* Champagne (1928)
* Blackmail (1929) - his first sound film; a classic!
* The Manxman (1929)
* Juno and the Paycock (1930)
* The Skin Game (1931)
* Rich and Strange (1932)
* Number 17 (1932)
* The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)
* The 39 Steps (1935)
* Secret Agent (1936)
* Sabotage (1936)
* Young and Innocent (1937)
* The Lady Vanishes (1938)
* Jamaica Inn (1939) -  last British box office hit before moving to Hollywood and directing the wonderful ""Rebecca""(1940)

Extra features include: Sorcerer's Apprentice (TV 1963), Cheney Vase (TV 1955), Hitchcock posters, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" (radio), Hitchcock trailers, a rare radio appearance, and a documentary. Although the movies are too early to be formally rated, St. Clair has added designations that should be helpful to parents (not suitable for children, may be unsuitable, suitable for children, adult situations, etc.) What a bargain for a Hitchcock fan!",1192752000,54,1423,4.991561181434599

These two earlier sets are available separately from Amazon for about $10 each.

All three sets are unremastered reissues (in 5.1 sound) from public domain (PD) films. Considering the low price for 18 films from Hitchcock's British period (1922-39), the fact that some of the early films are of less than maximal interest to the casual Hitchcock fan, who prefers his 50s and 60s movies, and the fact that this set has some interesting extra features, this is good value for the money. Quality is variable, however, as with all PD issues. The two most watchable films (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes) are available from Criterion at considerable expense.

20 June 2007 update (original review 6 Apr.): The 6 DVDs are included in 6 DVD slim cases, each of which has on the back side brief information on the films. The slim cases are housed in a lightweight cardboard slipcase. DVD cases and slipcase are white, making Hitchcock look like a kindly old uncle. Black suits him better. However, this St. Clair edition is very nicely done.

Incidentally, St. Clair recently reissued some of its other material in similar (white, slim cases, etc.) appearing sets: sets on film noir, westerns, WWII, romance, silent greats, horror, etc.",1175817600,109,1964,5.329032258064516
2725709,4,B000M5KA44,"Does anyone know what films will be included on this collection?  Otherwise, sort of shooting in the dark to purchase.  Obviously, ignore the rating....I am hopeful it may turn out to be 4 stars.",1172275200,3,195,4.705882352941177
8166638,5,B000M5KA44,"This is a great collection for the price! These early Hitchcock films are mostly in the public domain and many have been released before on DVD and VHS before that, but the quality was generally terrible: hard to see and especially to hear. However, I am extremely pleased by this collection as all the films seem to be of a much higher quality than earlier releases. Many of these are silent movies and all of them are 80 to 90 years old, so one could expect them not to be as clear as modern HD videos. But these are all quite watchable, even the silent movies have music added, and for the price this is a great overview of Hitchcock's early works.",1500681600,,651,4.344262295081967

Alfred Hitchcock could scare an audience but they knew it would turn out alright. This is the third repackaging of these movies (The Legend Begins, A Legacy of Suspense); the six discs imply higher quality. All are in monochrome. The movies made before 1929 are silent, the newer ones have higher quality. The two 25 minute movies are from his 1950's TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Sabotage came from the novel The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad. Europe then was threatened by terrorist bombs, much like today. The movie The Secret Agent is taken from the novel Ashenden by Somerset Maugham. The 39 Steps came from a famous novel by John Buchan (who had an interesting career). It pointed out that Britain was no longer isolated from the Continent. The plot was used a number of times (innocent man pursued by both the police and the criminals). The Man Who Knew Too Much was reproduced in 1956. The last version (not by Hitchcock) was called Foul Play. The Lodger came from a novel by Marie Belloc-Lowndes. Here are the titles for each DVD.

8166642,3,B000M5KA44,"The movies in this set are very good to excellent.  My review is not of the movies, but of this particular set, the Ultimate Hitchcock Collection in the white box with Hitch's photo on it.  The video and audio quality in this set are poor.  Yes, I know these films are mostly from the 1930s.  But I've seen a few of them on other DVDs and they look & sound much better.

On the other hand, the price of this set is very low.  That's the tradeoff.  You could spend around $20 per film for the Criterion versions of a few of these and get the best possible sound and video quality given the source material.  This set gives you a bunch of Hitch's earliest films for cheap--including some that aren't readily available elsewhere.",1420416000,2,726,4.365671641791045

If you're a Hitchcock fan, and want to see his early British work (including several silent feature films) you've few options.  The Lady Vanishes, The 39 Steps, and most recently, the original The Man Who Knew Too Much can be purchased individually, in their restored Criterion editions, but they are rather pricey.  This set is well worth the money, just to see the early efforts of The Master!",1355529600,4,474,4.827160493827161

I think of Hitchcock as being only a suspense director but these selections show his range of directorial ability.  Although there are amusing scenes in the later films, I never really appreciated Hitchcock's sense of humor until I saw these early films.",1199145600,13,383,5.0476190476190474
