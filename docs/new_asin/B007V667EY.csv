5111325,4,B007V667EY,So I had seen the bad reviews and tried it anyways and I am so glad that I did.  It is NOT cardio at all but it does work our muscles.  I thought that it wasn't working because the standing work seemed so easy but when I got to the floor work portion my thighs were burning and I couldn't even finish all of the reps!  I wouldn't recommend this as your only work out but it's a nice one to throw in there  to mix up your workouts and keep it balanced!,1365465600,10,451,3.817204301075269
5111326,4,B007V667EY,"A decent workout, if a little boring.. Not the wonderful in-your-face Jazzercize I knew and loved. in the old days.",1362182400,,115,4.8
5111327,3,B007V667EY,I'd say it's just an okay workout for a day where you want to take it easy. I ordered it because I'm always looking for a dance workout and really liked the Jazzercise Dancing Abs which I found to be a challenging workout. This workout is rather short and geared more for beginners. The instructors are not particularly inspiting as 2 out of 3 are not lean nor show muscle definition. I would not buy this again.,1358467200,3,412,4.363636363636363
5111328,4,B007V667EY,"I enjoy Body Ballet by Jazzercise and highly recommend it. Body Ballet by Jazzercise certainly works every muscle group and is very easy to follow. It is a FULL BODY workout,not just lower body. The segments for your arms and for your inner things are very challenging (love the challenge)! This video is excellent but the music is somewhat boring. But when I put on this video I complete it which is attributed also to the pleasant instructors and the total toning rewards. It's a very good addition to my fitness workout. I'm a Jazzercise student, and was not disappointed with this purchase.",1345075200,14,594,4.776699029126213
5111329,5,B007V667EY,wife loves jazzercise: ballet body. seller sent it on time and it was just what she was looking for. thanks!!!!!!!!!,1408665600,,116,4.85
5111330,5,B007V667EY,"I've always wanted to learn ballet and if you are interested in it this is a great start. Although it is a workout DVD I feel it has most definitely taught me a few things about ballet while helping me strengthen my legs, hips, arms, abs etc.... It's a more slow paced DVD but will still kick your butt.",1403308800,5,303,4.1525423728813555
5111331,3,B007V667EY,"Like all Jazzercise routines, this one is well designed and provides good exercise for arms, legs, and abs. It was not as much fun as other j-cise videos I've used, though, because the routine is not structured as a continuous dance. I've only looked at the main workout, however; perhaps the supplemental ones on the disc are more dancelike.",1401148800,3,342,4.813559322033898
5111332,3,B007V667EY,"I watched only part of the DVD - not what I wanted - probably okay for someone younger.  It works up into a faster beat and bounce than I find comfortable at my age.  I was very disappointed after the reviews I read.  I guess I was hoping for more ""ballet"" and less ""jazzercize"" on this DVD.",1395878400,,291,4.0701754385964914
5111333,4,B007V667EY,Excellent stretch routines.  Liked the ability to choose various difficulty levels.  Great at to jazzercise when you are snowed in.,1394409600,2,131,5.5
5111334,5,B007V667EY,Different way to excercise.  This video is great if your looking for a different routine other than cardio.  I sweated during this video.,1385942400,2,137,4.913043478260869
5111335,5,B007V667EY,"Jazzercise is the very best exercise format for me, and I got the product very quickly and in great shape.",1381104000,,106,4.35
5111336,4,B007V667EY,I plan to use this to stretch out my legs and lower back for pain relief. It's a nice video with concise instructions and modified poses.,1379462400,,137,4.3076923076923075
5111337,5,B007V667EY,"The level is great for just starting to exercise again. I haven't relied solely on this DVD, but have integrated it with other forms of exercise. This is a nice alternative to the high-impact dance DVDs out there.",1368921600,7,213,4.631578947368421
5111338,3,B007V667EY,"This video isn't nearly as hard (aerobically) as the Jazzercise Core workout.  It focuses mainly on toning muscle.  For example, there's one sequence in which all you do is move your arms.  However, it's a fun alternative for non-aerobic days to get some muscle work in.  The moves are easy, and the instruction is good.",1367712000,2,320,4.763636363636364
8522137,5,B007V667EY,"I like the DVD until the last ab exercises. Wish they were placed a little earlier in the DVD so I didn't die at the end. But, great length, and great pace.",1513123200,,156,3.90625
8522138,5,B007V667EY,Harder than it looks. Great low profile workout.,1482364800,,48,5.125
8522139,4,B007V667EY,"All ballet, not dance mix, but good strength work!",1439337600,,50,4.666666666666667
8522140,5,B007V667EY,Good workout video.  I have been doing Jazzercise for years and use this when I can't get to class.,1438905600,,99,4.2105263157894735
8522141,5,B007V667EY,My wife liked it.,1435449600,,17,3.5
8522142,3,B007V667EY,"Good, but not the Jazzercise we expect.. If you want something different though..throw this one in every once in awhile.",1434585600,,120,5.05
8522143,4,B007V667EY,"The format is easy to follow, and very basic ballet moves. It's a great DVD if you're looking for something very low/no-impact, and still want to feel the burn. It did relatively nothing for me since I do a lot of running/lifting 6 days a week, but I would recommend it for others. Lots of great stretching & repetitive movements.",1430352000,,330,4.516666666666667
8522144,5,B007V667EY,Great workout with three different options depending on your mood and time available!,1428969600,,85,5.615384615384615
8522145,5,B007V667EY,I have loved Jazzercise for 20 years.  I recently purchased this because it sounded like something I would like to do when I don't feel like a real hard cardio work-out.  This is wonderful - it is going to tone my body like nothing else - I can tell - it is easy to follow and fun to do and I feel it working!  I alternate my cardio work-outs with this one.  Love it love it love it.,1421280000,,383,3.871794871794872
8522146,2,B007V667EY,"I can't find the right video/DVD  . This just isn't my style. I may have to make my own, a mix of jazz, ballet, broadway, and  swing, using great music . Will give it to someone.",1421280000,,178,3.9166666666666665
