8389509,5,B00365LBUE,I got this so my daughter could become familiar with the sounds of another language. Now she is in a dual language program in school and her teacher says she has no English accent when speaking Spanish. I think this is partly from early exposure to the sounds of the language by watching these and other Spanish language children's programs. Now she uses these to practice understanding Spanish in a way that is fun for her. Since we have many of these in English as well she knows what is going on so she can absorb the words based on meaning instead of translation. Each time she watches she recognizes more words in Spanish. I love that there are 5 episodes on each disc. I just wish all the other seasons were available too!,1376870400,,728,4.440298507462686
8389510,5,B00365LBUE,"I do have the English DVDs and I can say that the Spanish versions are as good or better than the English ones, mainly when they are singing to Latin rhythms like Guaracha, Cha cha cha, Cumbia, Conga and others. Both the English and the Spanish versions of the Backyardigans are exceptional entertaining and educational pieces of art that your kids will love.",1360627200,,359,4.714285714285714
