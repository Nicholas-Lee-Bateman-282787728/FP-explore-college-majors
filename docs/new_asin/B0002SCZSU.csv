8031363,3,B0002SCZSU,"To keep it short and sweet; this film is a bit silly and perhaps a little too cute, but it does have excellent production values and great actors. David Kelly and Milo O'Shea are excellent as always. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if it were possible.",1348358400,,254,4.204081632653061
