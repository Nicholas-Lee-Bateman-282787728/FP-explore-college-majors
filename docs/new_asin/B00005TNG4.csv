1661372,4,B00005TNG4,It's always worth any amount to see Rudolf Nureyev.  The only problem with this disc is the sound quality which is quite poor and there are no close captions available.  The dance sequences are thrilling.,1423785600,,204,4.8
1661373,5,B00005TNG4,Fabulous.  Many thanks.,1422489600,,23,6.666666666666667

1661376,5,B00005TNG4,"I was good  to see Nureyev at different stages of his life , both professionaL& personally.",1416096000,,91,4.6875
1661377,4,B00005TNG4,"If you recall the career and brilliant dancing of Rudolf Nureyev but know little about the man and the dancer, this video definitely fills that void. There are very interesting interviews with people who influenced him, both in his little town in Russia as well as in Europe, including ballet directors, instructors, and dance partners.  Nureyev himself is interviewed and does a lot of explaining of this life including, of course, his defection. There is nothing of his personal life in this video (except to say how lonely he was and that he had seven homes where he spent an average of a few weeks in each one) as this is how the dancer himself would want it. Nevertheless, it is quite an interesting chronicle of his career.",1409616000,,729,4.6953125
1661378,5,B00005TNG4,"I saw Nureyev and Fonteyn perform 'Giselle' with the Royal Ballet at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles in 1966, and have never forgotten the moment he stepped on stage; it was magic.

This documentary far exceeded my expectations. It is wonderful, intimate, and honest; how gratifying to see the man who embodied such artistry and discipline and how gracious of him to share so much of himself with us. Excellent footage and selection of his practice, rehearsals, and performances. Brilliant commentary from those who knew him well. Absolutely fabulous!",1396137600,,556,5.177777777777778
1661379,5,B00005TNG4,He is the dancer of our lives.  He speaks frankly about leaving Russia and about celebrity in the free world.  I fell in love with him as did almost everyone who ever met him.  He was gay but I adore him regardless of his orientation.  He was a delicious person and will remain so in my mind forever.,1394755200,,300,4.120689655172414
1661380,5,B00005TNG4,It is a very well done portrait of one of this world's greatest artists.  It is enjoyable to view.  I would recommend it to everyone.,1394150400,,133,4.28
1661381,4,B00005TNG4,"As a longtime admirer of Nureyev, I have always been interested in details about his life.  This video provides some interesting insights into his personality and some enjoyable excerpts from some of the ballets in which he performed.",1391731200,,234,5.157894736842105
1661392,4,B00005TNG4,"i have the earlier production of this DVD by Kultur and I was hoping that this edition might have more dance matreial i.e., the full production of ""Marguerite and Armand"", instead of a very short snippet. Oh, well.....it is fine otherwise.",1386892800,,239,4.853658536585366
1661393,5,B00005TNG4,"Both great dancers...because it is old, the graphics are blurred and not sharp...however, the beatiful quality of dance professionals is still there...",1345680000,,151,5.909090909090909
1661394,5,B00005TNG4,Wonderful performances by Dane Erik Bruhn and Russian Tatar Rudolf Nureyev from various ballets with equally talented ballerinas.  Altogether a treat for the eyes and senses.  This DVD is their complete Bell Telephone Hour Performances from 1961 - 1967 (as described here).  It will be enjoyed for many years to come.,1215475200,,317,5.176470588235294
1661395,5,B00005TNG4,"Wonderful as a period piece but most of all provides a rare opportunity to enjoy the artistry of the underappreciated and fabulous Erik Bruhn. Despite the small performance space and lack of camera angles, Erik Bruhn's talent shines through....incomparable upper body movement and exquisite partnering (especially with Carla Fracci). No wonder Nureyev considered him the only person he would want to emulate. The wonderfully corny introductions also take you back in time. Despite the technical limitations of the period, this is a winner.",1209340800,,539,5.506024096385542
1661396,5,B00005TNG4,"This is an excellent documentary film. Unlike most documentaries made about famous and exceptional people, this one has Rudi himself discus his own life from the very beginning. By the way, he speaks English so well, and he is extremely intelligent. It is a pleasure to listen to him.

As the previous review mentions, the film is filled with rare photos and footage of Rudi's various performances. Especially interesting are his rare, early Russian performances. They show an excerpt of his Russian competition, which he won. The film also includes a lot of interesting, later performances, when he was an internationally renowned star.

However, I think that the final scene of the movie stands out the most. I was actually a little shocked and surprised by it. Well, I have never seen anything like it. In the final scene, Nureyev expresses his disappointment and dissatisfaction with the society. He says that the whole society is artificial, and that he does not fit in it, and that he buys houses only outside of cities. Then Nureyev is  shown COMPLETELY naked, and he jumps into the water and swims away.

I think that the ending of the film not only demostrates Nureyev's farewell to everyone, it also shows his protest against the society.
Anyway, this is definitely, if not the best, then one of the best documentary films I have ever watched.

By the way, Nureyev seemed happy when he was talking; he smiled a lot. However, he had less than 2 years left to live. I wonder if he knew that he would die so soon, or if he hoped to find a cure.",1197590400,,1551,4.666666666666667
1661397,5,B00005TNG4,"Dear Sir or Madam,

  This is a must for anyone who adores Nureyev.  I saw a TV program version of this DVD on PBS around 1995.",1168473600,,127,3.769230769230769
1661398,5,B00005TNG4,"Seated on a rocky shore facing his own island across from Naples, Italy, Rudolf Nureyev narrates the story of his life from the time he was born on a Siberian train passing near Lake Baikal to the small town of Ufa, Russia and on to the ballet school in Leningrad and the Kirov Ballet, his defection in Paris, France and at last worldwide fame. This progress is illustrated with photos and film clips as well as comments from family, friends, teachers and ballet partners. The film ends with his last trip to Russia to visit his dying mother and he bids us farewell as drops into the sea in the nude and swims away.",1132617600,,615,4.4035087719298245
1661399,5,B00005TNG4,"For someone who not only enjoys watching great dancers perform, but who also appreciates a good biography, I was impressed by every minute of this DVD documentary. Whether or not you're a dance fanatic, you're bound to be amazed by the life, contribution and influence of one of ballet's greatest masters.
The story told in these 90 minutes has everything: photos of Rudolph as a boy, amazing archival film footage from his early dance training, very good video recordings of 60's and 70's dance performances, and interviews with Nureyev and his sister, teachers, mentors and celebrated dance partners. I would have preferred that the Russian speech had been complemented with subtitles instead of being talked over by English translators, but that's a minor criticism that I could overlook since each of those interviewed was rather captivating. Overall, the presentation is fairly balanced between dialogue and dance, revealing many different perspectives on Nureyev's life. Also, I was very pleased to see a few of the short repertory performances shown in their entirety. Nureyev's incredible talent on the dance floor is clearly evident, you'll see. The more recent footage of Nureyev in his home studio warming up his worn-out body is at once both amazing and sad. He really did intend to perform until he died.
Even though there's almost nothing in the way of special DVD features, this disc doesn't need them. The story, dancing and production are all superb. I'll be watching this many more times to come.",1016236800,,1514,5.108870967741935

7953645,3,B00005TNG4,"Watch it, this is the exact same dvd that comes same heading, different jacket.  If one is a Nureyev
dancer devotee and gathers these things (as well as Polunin, yes?) just be sure you are not
duplicating.  I did.",1484697600,,213,4.435897435897436
7953646,3,B00005TNG4,"I didn't realize it was taped so long ago, and so picture quality wasn't what I expected/hoped for.",1483401600,,99,4.555555555555555
7953647,5,B00005TNG4,"Nureyev will be forever the best dancer in the history of ballet! He was charimatic, handsome, extremly talented, great actor, excellent technique, with a commanding presence on stage! even if there were a thousand dancers on stage you could only see Nureyev!
I was at the opening of Marguerite and Armand with Fonteyn, and it was the perfect ballet for them: she was mature, experienced, with great
musicality and a wonderful ballerina and he was young, with a great personality, a dashing suitor for Marguerite; I can still remember and I
shiver as I do when he came from the back of the stage to Marguerite, who was dying, he ran with a cape and you could feel his anguish and
despair! I cried when the curtain came down.  You will enjoy this DVD and watch it over and over again.",1465862400,,783,4.553191489361702
7953648,5,B00005TNG4,A delight to view this wonderful artists life story from his point of view. Such a treat to watch his gift of ballet. I so regret having never seen him dance in theater. This DVD is a very interesting history of some of ballets challenges. I have watched it numerous times.,1463702400,,273,4.372549019607843
7953649,5,B00005TNG4,Rare and glorious examples of the two best male dancers of the modern era. Excellent quality video and thrillingly executed dances.,1449792000,,131,5.285714285714286

7953652,5,B00005TNG4,great fast service love the fotos,1437177600,,33,4.666666666666667
7953653,5,B00005TNG4,"Nureyev was the greatest ballet dancer and perhaps greatest athlete of all time, with a life history so interesting and unique it can never be equaled. Because this was produced with his full cooperation, many of his less than admirable qualities are ignored, so if you want a balanced view I suggest you read Diane Solway's ""Nureyev: His Life"", a thoroughly engrossing biography. The other drawback is that this was filmed before he was diagnosed with AIDS (or at least before anyone admitted it), but that makes the more-or-less happy ending all the more tragic and ironic. The plethora of commentary by and interviews with the icon himself make this an irreplaceable document. Fascinating.",1426982400,,692,5.078947368421052
