Alas I can't say the same about the film version of the Nautical Chart. As usual, the film can't hold a candle to the book. Significant changes are made from the book that neither fit the story, nor the intention of the book. The ending is pure disappointment in the film; completely different from the film and totally out of character with the characters and the intention of the book.
Acting is at best mediocre, too. Especially so the acting of the female role. The intimacy scenes can't be described in any other way, but ridiculous.

If you really have time to kill, then by all means - see it. However, the film is not worth more than $15-20 at most. I have to say that I was warned about this by the daughter of the writer, but curiosity killed the cat :-).",1524700800,,904,4.255813953488372
