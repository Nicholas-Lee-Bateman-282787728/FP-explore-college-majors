2445408,5,B000BXHHUW,"This is an example of Almighty God's love for all of us, if we simply come to Him, as did  Karla with her horrible past and asking for foregiveness and surrendering her life to him,  we can also know that same foregiveness and love by surrendering our hearts to our ALMIGHTY LOVING HEAVENLY FATHER and He WILL FOREGIVE and make us clean too. Sin is sin!!

This is the ultimate love of God, not that we loved Him, but that He loved us and sent His only son to the cross for one reason, to take our filthy sins upon himself and died for us, HE PAID IT ALL SO WE CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WITH HIM IF WE ACCEPT HIS SACRIFICE ON THE CROSS. AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. THE ULTIMATE OF
GOD'S LOVE AND FOREGIVENESS.  JESUS PAID IT ALL, ALL TO HIM I OWE.

2445409,5,B000BXHHUW,"Very touching. It builds your strength to see forgivenss in action. The prison is not for from me, which made it closer to home.  I cried and cried.",1355443200,,148,4.285714285714286
2445410,5,B000BXHHUW,"I watched it and showed it to my friends.  One of them ended up buy one so he can show his friends.. and my other friend ended up keeping it.. lol... never got it back. It's a beautiful documentary, which shows how powerful forgiveness is to someone's life.  I LOVED THIS VIDEO.",1324598400,2,278,4.326923076923077
2445411,3,B000BXHHUW,"I was pleased with the subject matter in general and the intensity of emotion which was real and captivating. However, the quality sound was uneven. Still, with all that in mind, a gripping story of forgiveness which I recommend for all those who wish to see the breadth of God's mercy in action.",1304380800,,296,4.60377358490566
2445412,5,B000BXHHUW,The Power of Forgiveness is a great movie that shows how important it is to forgive others.  Hatred only breeds hatred and discontent within ourselves.  True healing (of ourselves) only comes through forgiveness.  We forgive others for what it does to us as much as for what it does to the ones we forgive.,1278720000,,306,4.62962962962963
2445413,5,B000BXHHUW,"We all have faults. This video shows the power of forgivness in releasing us from hate, retaliation and vengence. We can not condone what a person does to others, but our harboring these emotions will, if we do not forgive, drag us down in our relationships with others.",1269302400,,270,4.645833333333333
2445414,5,B000BXHHUW,"Her life was a tragedy.  Her mother lead her down the wrong road in life. Being a prostitute and drug addict herself, led an innocent 10 year old down that hell bound road. But God... intervened and, while in prison, He was able to deliver her from that lifestyle. She heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for the first time, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, Karla was set free from all addictions and a sinful lifestyle. Although it wasn't God's will that her sentence here in the earth to be commuted but, if her conversion was genuine, then she's in a better place. The Bible says, ""to be absent from the body; present with the Lord.""",1227744000,,643,4.4033613445378155
2445415,3,B000BXHHUW,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD. It is less than 31 minutes and focuses more on the brother (Ron Thornton) of the slain woman than it does on Karla Faye. You only see snippets of Karla Fay throughout the short film, but they reveal her mind and heart. It is the brother and his difficulty in forgiving Karla Faye that is the focus of this film. However, if you are already convinced of the genuine transformation of this woman, seeing her voice the hope that her execution will give peace to those filled with hatred of her will reinforce your conviction of her purity of heart. The film does make an eloquent statement though of the power of forgiveness to restore peace to and uplift one's soul. Ron Thornton is proof of that.",1212364800,8,738,4.514925373134329
2445416,5,B000BXHHUW,"This womens fantastic life testimony of the horrors her life included and the forgiveness she received anyway encouraged me when I was asked to give my own testimony at church. It also made me very excited to become involved in prison ministry. In her life and death Karla Faye Tucker was, and continues to be, an encouragement. This book would be wonderful for anyone in the prison system and outside as an example of an overcomer of unthinkable events and consequences. Another great one is Carol Kent, Laying My Isaac Down.",1177286400,3,526,4.791208791208791
2445417,5,B000BXHHUW,"This book is compelling from the first page. It is deeply religious in nature and dramatically illustrates the power of forgiveness. It is a gripping story about the awesome freedom that is found through forgiveness. I read it in three sittings and the next day took it and gave it to a forty year old friend who has never forgiven his father for beating him and his siter as they grew up. If he will, he too can experience the freedom Karla and her victim's brother were able to experience through the forgiveness they both found in Jesus Christ. A true story you will love reading about.",1175040000,3,589,4.514018691588785

8093875,5,B000BXHHUW,"This is a short documentary, but well worth it.  It is the profoundly moving account of one man, Ron Carlson, and his journey toward peace and forgiveness after experiencing the murder of his sister, Deborah Thornton, by Karla Faye Tucker and her boyfriend in 1983.  Karla Faye Tucker is in the documentary as well.  Your heart goes out to Ron and your heart goes out to Karla.  God has worked in each of their lives to reconcile them to Himself and to each other.  Beautiful story filled with hope, love and the power of God to change lives.  Peggy Kurtz, the sister of the other murder victim, Jerry Lynn Dean, also forgave Karla, and found peace as well.  Amazing transforming power of forgiveness is seen in this film.  You will not be disappointed.",1403827200,,753,4.609022556390977
