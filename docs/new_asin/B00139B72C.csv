Like Primrose Path and other films Ginger made, It's a drama (no singing or dancing). She meets Joseph Cotton on a train in the Holiday season. Each have a secret they try to keep from each other. He is service man ""on leave"" and she going to visit family.  They land up falling in love.  Shirley Temple is a teen in the film and there are other cast that fit so well.
