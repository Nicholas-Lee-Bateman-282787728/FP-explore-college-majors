8710636,4,B00VNQWV20,"With reenactments and interviews this shares the stories of the king who was originally hoped great things. His marriage had not produced a son and he aspired for a divorce, the Pope declined to permit that. An advisor suggested he separate from the Catholic faith and run England as the head of the church AND Monarch! He liked that idea and decided that his decisions were...God's decisions. Thus he went through a collection of advisors and wives that fit his fancy, what a sad mess. He aspired to beat France in a war and the main ship sank in front of him!

8710642,3,B00VNQWV20,"This is a 60 minute video with scene selection and English subtitles.
There are reenactments of Henry and his court however they pop in and out so fast, back and forth between the talking heads, the narrators. It becomes really irritating  too fast, too many and too much.  It would be nice, if one day those who make educational videos would give these learned men and women their minutes of fame and glory and then just let them narrate over the pictures.

The video itself emphasizes Henrys distrust of the aristocracy, instead putting his trust in those from the lower classes such as Cardinal Wolsey  the son of a butcher. The explanation of his break from the Catholic Church is explained well.
It can be an educational video, if one can overlook the quick cuts in and out.",1444348800,7,779,4.6231884057971016

8710644,3,B00VNQWV20,"I should have looked closer when I got this, it is only one hour long. I was hoping for a more in-depth look at what had to be one of my very favorite period of history. Don't get me wrong it was very well done but did, because of the time restraints, gloss over a lot of things. They didn't get too much into the wives and they didn't get too much into some of his more personal views. For a small little intro to Henry, this will do, otherwise...not so much.",1437091200,11,460,4.010869565217392
