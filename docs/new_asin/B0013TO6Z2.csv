8252835,4,B0013TO6Z2,"It is a relief to see a film on Tantra that really tries to start with a focus on the practice as a whole while still treating the sexual aspect of it that seems to be so intriguing for some westerners. I suspect that the treatment of sexuality in the video was still very out of proportion to its place in the ""religion"" as it was originally practiced, but it was probably wise to include its as a kind of lure to gain ears for the rest of the teaching. I have no problem with that, But i still feel that the general fate of such cultural immigrants to the modern west-dominated world (namely a kind of cultural customs office confiscation process wherein any foreign teaching is systematically deprived of any content that has any real potential to transform or challenge the status quo of industrial capitalism), has been visited upon this attempt to introduce tantra to the west as well.

Notwithstanding the authors claims of our connectedness to the whole of nature, the usual ""new age"" privatized view of health, spirituality, and wellbeing, is evident in promises of becoming ""prosperous"" (albeit circuitously) as a result of the practices. The typical politically tranquilizing advice about making eco-consumer choices (rather than say, broaching the possibility and possible necessity of real rebellion, civil disobedience, etc vis-a-vis the sick socio-economic and political culture that is systematically destroying the shared body that we call Nature...) is another sign of this sort of thing. I could understand some preemptive disavowal  of the use of violence from this quarter and I would generally agree (although I wonder if there is not some Tantric way of being  what we would call violent) but I don't see why the seriousness of the situation could not be addressed head on in the film, and can only conjecture that the author (who is after all attempting to sell spirituality in a sense) was so caught up in the business end of things as not to see its inherent inconsistency with any values of ultimate togetherness with the natural (or spiritual) world.

That said, the the film is still very pleasant to watch (mildly and pleasantly psychedelic as well due to the impositions of the authors artwork over her presentation--which is filmed in a beautiful outdoor setting) and about as instructive as it could be in 2 hours without rushing things. All in all I would say it is as good a DVD about Tantra as I have seen so far.",1306972800,3,2449,4.8238095238095235
8252836,4,B0013TO6Z2,I have had this video for a couple weeks now. Since purchasing the video I have really begun to look at the world diferently. it has open my awareness. Tantra explains each movement very well and leads you through the routine step by step. She also really explains each movement. I would strongly recomend this video for anyone wanting to try Tantric exercises or wanting to expand there knowledge of Tantric training.,1202860800,3,418,4.819444444444445
