The plot was ridiculous,almost dream-like - similar to  Alice in Wonderland-Through the Looking Glass. The story centered around several characters :Don Quixote, the power mad gangster, who dreams of ruling India, Ms. India, the good prostitute looking for a real man to love her, Hero, (played by Shahrukh Khan) who falls in love with Ms. India, Don Quixote's obsessive son, who wanted to possess Ms. India by any means necessary, and the President (played by Apunam Kher).
There were several subplots going on at the same time: a budding love story between Hero and Ms. India and the conflicting admiration of Don Quixote' son who also wanted her and was willing to do anything to possess her; Hero's brain tumor (which makes Ms. India more protective of him)  the villain's ( Don Quixote) megalomaniac rantings about ruling India; the President's all too careful handling of the State of Emergency which Don Quixote made worst, the president's evil double, who wants to auction India off and only gets one rupee (1 rupee= 65 cents US) , and so on.

You may find yourself getting confused at times, but I encourage you to watch it to the end; it's really funny. I recommend that you watch it at least three times or more if necessary to grasp the meaning of this film (I'm serious).",1447027200,,1448,4.692913385826771
8295857,1,B001E0S8JK,"I really looked forward to seeing this movie since I LOVE Shah Rukh Khan and the cover on the case looks so cheerful and upbeat. I thought it was going to be funny, romantic, and like alot of his other films. Wow, was I wrong! It was dark--literally--taking place mostly at night (if not completely at night), and ridiculous but not in an entertaining way. And then towards the end it became serious, involving corruption of the politicians and gun-toting guys. It was just too weird, almost like someone was on a drug trip when they came up with this movie. That or a dream they had. I'm so glad I never decided to buy this movie. What a waste of money and time that would be.",1342051200,2,677,4.338582677165355
