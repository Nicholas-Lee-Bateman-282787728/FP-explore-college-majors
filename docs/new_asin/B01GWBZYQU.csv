8763723,1,B01GWBZYQU,This was a very generic video. The information could have been used for just about any breed of dog. The only useful part was the included training information. The rest of the video was a waste of time. Not worth the price of the video.,1503619200,,237,4.288888888888889
8763724,1,B01GWBZYQU,"This DVD was a complete waste of money. The section on the bulldog is only about 15 minutes long and there is only one bulldog puppy on the whole DVD. The information provided isn't even that specific to the bulldog.
The bonus features include a tape of dogs running and barking and it made my dog bark and go nuts! Not exactly what I would call good entertainment for my dog when I am out of the house.
Please don't waste your money on this DVD. There are a lot of great bulldog books out there that would be a far better value!!",1230422400,4,530,4.155339805825243
