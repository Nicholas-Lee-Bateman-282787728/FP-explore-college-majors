2525409,5,B000EOTUS0,"The Rat Pack Collection are three movies that were made by ""The Rat Pack"" back in the early 60's.  Sammy Davis shows off his dance moves and his gunslinging. Frank sings and Dean is running at about 90 proof.  Bing Cosby also appears.
Good nostalgia for the older among us and a look into the ""good old days"" of film for the rest.",1250035200,,330,4.222222222222222
2525410,5,B000EOTUS0,"I have always loved the ""Rat Pack"". This is a great collection of movies if you like Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr.
Thanks for putting so many good movies in one collection!!!! I am especially pleased to find  Ocean's 11 and Robin and the Seven Hoods. These 2 are my favorites of the Rat Pack.
Thanks again for putting all these great movies in one collection!!!

2525411,4,B000EOTUS0,"This collection is great.  I watched Ocean's 11 again and finally watched Robin and the 7 Hoods for the first time.  Both are great.  I especially like the ""Mr. Booze"" number from Robin and the 7 Hoods.  Too funny.

I still have yet to watch 4 for Texas, but if you're a Rat pack fan and don't have their movies this is a good way to start.",1203292800,,340,4.014925373134329
2525412,5,B000EOTUS0,"There are four Sinatra sets to be released on May 13. A repackaged version of this set is one of them. The set will contain:

Ocean's Eleven (newly repackaged)
Sergeant's 3 (never before on DVD!)
4 For Texas (newly repackaged)
Robin and the Seven Hoods (newly repackaged)

So you might hold off on buying this one now until the official word from Warner Home Video comes out. I don't have a Suggested Retail Price on this set yet, but chances are you'll save on buying the four films together in a boxed set. That's always a better buy than buying any DVD individually. There is no link on this site to this new set yet, otherwise I would include it.",1201910400,18,650,4.408333333333333

2525416,5,B000EOTUS0,"It's exactly what I wanted. Reasonably priced and delivery was very fast.

Good quality DVD's! I'm a fan of Dean Martin and I liked the movies very much. It was back to my youth by viewing them.

And now for Sergeants 3!

What a pity that movie is for the moment not available.

Anyone got a copy?

Thanks a lot and see you,

2525437,3,B000EOTUS0,"I realize three stars isn't a bold statement, but this set is worth three stars.  By now I assume most people know these are glorified ""home movies"" and not classic cinema.  But then, I don't think most people (myself included) bought this for classic cinema, but to relive... for one reason or another... the Rat Pack glory years.  And with that in mind, Ocean's Eleven works.  It is indeed a kick in the head watching Frank, Dean, Sammy and the boys do what they do.  The heist is improbable.  So what?  Glorified home movie of the Pack.  Know what it is... know what it's not... and enjoy.  (A quick aside.  My wife and I enjoy this version as a lark; We love the remake as good movie making.)  4 for Texas is neither comedy nor drama.  It's OK, I guess, but I wouldn't have bought that movie as a stand alone purchase.  It stars Frank and Dean and had Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress  as ""visually appealing"" co-stars.  But remember, the movie is a Western.  Finally Robin and the 7 Hoods.  Like Ocean's, it's interesting and fun to watch the gang cavort on the big screen. But that's about it.  Bottom line is there are some good parts in the 3 movies, some interesting parts to watch once or twice, and a few funny scenes (such as the Three Stooges in 4 for Texas.)  So buyer beware.  But then I bought it... for the right price.",1412035200,,1335,4.349593495934959

2525443,4,B000EOTUS0,"Ocean's Eleven and Robin and the 7 Hoods are not bad.  The Ocean's Eleven remake with George Clooney and Brad Pitt is better than the original.  Four for Texas is atrocious.  It should have never been made.  If you have a copy of Four for Texas, i recommend taking it to a missile silo they are about to decommission, and drop it in when the silo is half-full of concrete so no one can ever be subjected to that horrible movie again.",1395532800,,433,4.2439024390243905
