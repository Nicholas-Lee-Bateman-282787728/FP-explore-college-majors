Those people who criticized Naveen Andrews' accent in Lost will be surprised at how well this Londoner does with a New York accent.
We have three NRI's coming to India to find something,a band, an acting career, a brother.  They have varying degrees of success and of course are frustrated with local reality.  It isn't a glamorous view of India.  The characters are the classic fishes out of water, referred to as local foreigners.
Roshan Seth and Naseeruddin Shah both provide excellent support to the characters and help move the story along, providing just a bit of over the top acting to fit in with the setting, but not so much that it could be distracting.
It is a nice salute to Mel Brooks' The Producers, as well as a good satire of overacted and overdrawn movies.
My biggest gripe is that the price is way to high and makes this movie out of reach to many viewers.  I found it someplace else.  I ask that Amazon consider it for online streaming and also try to find some other sellers.",1344470400,,1152,4.536231884057971

It's all in English and the parts in Hindi are translated to English, so you don't miss out on anything. Great mocking of Indian movies as well, when it comes to a few of the songs. You have to watch this movie with an open mind, otherwise you won't enjoy it. Great song to watch out for in the movie, ""yeah yeah"". its simple, yet explains so much :)",1171497600,3,513,4.191919191919192
