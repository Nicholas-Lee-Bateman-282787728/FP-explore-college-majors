If you have nothing to do and have watched every other movie in the house and block buster is closed. then go for it. It is a funny at times stupid at times just a goof. I'm not sorry I watched it but I may not ever again,1342137600,,283,3.6557377049180326
8091012,1,B000BPZ81A,"Just like the film it's based on, this is low budget and dull.
There are a few highlights but none worth paying to see.",1334620800,,119,4.0

8091015,5,B000BPZ81A,"With all due respect the other reviewer is wrong. This DVD is FUNNY!!! If they were expecting ""Wicked"" then I can understand their disappointment, but then whose fault is it for buying the wrong DVD? This is a brilliantly done parody and it's frigging hilarious! Think ""Wizard of Oz"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project."" Give it a chance! If you have a sense of humor chances are you'll laugh your butt off!!!",1208476800,8,405,4.638888888888889
