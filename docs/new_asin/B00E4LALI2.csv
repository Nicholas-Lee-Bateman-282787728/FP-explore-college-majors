5890057,1,B00E4LALI2,"What is the deal with this movie?? I'm starting to think it will never come out!!! The guy making it must be an ex video game creator, It's been pushed back three times now.... Anybody know what's happening with it?? Why make a release date if you are not going to keep it?? 1 star only because it hasn't been released yet.",1410739200,6,323,4.225806451612903
5890058,5,B00E4LALI2,"I am considering ordering this item but it looks like the producer spent gobs of money filming this in hi-def, yet couldn't fork over any dough to add Closed-Captioning for people with impaired hearing/who are deaf. Does this product include captions or not?  The product description does not seem to indicate the availability of captions.",1404086400,5,339,5.163636363636364
5890059,1,B00E4LALI2,"Complete misnomer.  Very poor photography of endless like shots of the Grand Canyon and colorado.  If this is supposed to be 4K good riddance to all those new tvs.  We have a Sony 65"" 4k and true 4k is amazing.  This isn't worth the postage much less the cost.",1423353600,,260,4.244897959183674
5890060,1,B00E4LALI2,"Even the title is mis-leading.  It should be ""The Grand Canyon and Rockies The Beautiful"" as that was about the only thing shown in the video.  Also, the cinematography was not well done.  Not close to the quality of ""The Oceans"" or ""The Forest"" on Netflix.",1423353600,3,257,4.543478260869565
5890061,1,B00E4LALI2,Very Disappointed. Was looking forward to realizing the benefits of our 4K Television but found that this movie delivered sub-par imagery presented in a boring manner by a monotone voice with repetitive background elevator music. OK if you would like to see pictures of the Grand Canyon and other Western National Parks but do not expect the photography or the presentation to be state-of-the-art.,1423267200,3,397,5.21875
5890062,1,B00E4LALI2,"This is NOT an America Video.  This is a video of approximately one half hour of the Grand Canyon with many, many repeat views and the balance of the video, approximately one hour, of the Rocky Mountains with an ungodly amount of creeks with dead limbs and repeats over and over of trees with a few views of the mountains themselves.  To add insult to injury, sound is lost for the last 20 plus minutes of the video.
This video should be renamed for what it is----the Grand Canyon and the Rocky Mountains.
Whatever happened to the rest of our great America?
If you enjoy being bored  for over an hour and a half, go ahead and buy this video.",1423180800,,641,4.325

5890064,1,B00E4LALI2,"Don't waste your money!  I have a 64 inch-Samsung F8500 plasma screen. The movie looks horrible. Too grainy. It should have looked better, being that it's a blu-ray. I have many movies shot with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and my Sony NEXT-VG30 - They look awesome!

It was a pure waste also because they showed very little of the country (mostly the Grand Canyon). I wish I can return it. Planet Earth looks way better than this!",1423008000,,427,4.461538461538462
5890065,3,B00E4LALI2,The scenery is beautiful but it seems it has an agenda in regards to the Colorado River. The whole production drags...at times I just fast-forwarded it.  At 1:16:39 the sound dropped out and never came back. Will return it for another copy just to see it the sound is ok on the next one.,1422748800,,287,4.314814814814815
5890066,2,B00E4LALI2,"Sound just quits with 15 minutes remaining on the DVD. Poor name for title. Only covers grand canyon and rocky mountains not the 'country"".",1422748800,,139,4.833333333333333
5890067,5,B00E4LALI2,"Great Camera work. At first I didn't like the resolution. The movie starts out in bad cloudy weather, but it slowly progresses and gets awesome. I got the best results when I went to my menu and changed the ( mode ) from Dynamic to Dynamic Fixed. Then the full beauty of this UHD dvd came to life.",1422576000,2,297,4.137931034482759

8600965,1,B00E4LALI2,"pros: A few good pictures.
cons: Everything else. Boring narration, mostly just postcard images filmed (This is nothing more really than a PowerPoint with bad narration and music), somnolent musical score. Save your money! Watching this is torturous waste of time. Extremely disappointing! Please do not buy. I was lucky that I returned it in time for a refund since the sound score is defective. Amazon should discontinue this item!",1424476800,,433,5.2
8600966,1,B00E4LALI2,"The makers of this movie should be embarrassed. As others have reported, only two locations are show and the audio goes out with 15 minutes left. Having a 4k TV and watched true 4k programming I can say that I was not impressed with this video at all. UPS has already picked up my copy to be returned to Amazon. At the time of writing this I am glad to see the item is out of stock so it cant disappoint anymore consumers.",1423699200,3,422,4.096385542168675
8600967,2,B00E4LALI2,"I made it half way through and shut it off. Still wondering if the film crew ever made it out of the Grand Canyon. I hope they're ok. Well in fairness they did make there way to Colorado eventually.

I just drags on, horrible narration and background music don't help at all.",1423699200,3,275,4.288461538461538
8600968,1,B00E4LALI2,"The photography is very good.  The 4K picture if fantastic!  The narration is very poor.  The music in the background is poor, boring, not innovative, and puts me to sleep most of the time.  The editing of the beautiful scenes is UNIMAGINATIVE - VERY BORING.  The narration is very poor and the actual story line is extremely lacking.  This project could have been great using the fantastic 4k capability, but it is awful!  Every time the narrator begins speaking, the background music (sound) is suddenly reduced in volume -  very upsetting to the flow of the program.  This would have been very easy to fix by putting gradual changes to volumes (crescendo of the narration while diminuendo of the music).  The use of the fine photography filmed in 4K has almost no imagination.  It is just slow one picture after another.  It puts one to sleep.

In addition the sound track completely STOPS at 1:16:39 (one hour, 16 minutes, and 39 seconds).  This is probably a major flaw in the original master from the manufacture.

I waited 5 months to receive my copy after ordering.  I am completely disappointed.  I am getting a full refund for this defective (and very, very poor) production.

Sincerely,  Michael",1423526400,5,1206,4.795121951219512

8600970,1,B00E4LALI2,"After waiting for over a YEAR for this, it finally arrived and is a mess.  There are film editing errors and paths sound completely cuts out for the last 15 minutes.  We played that a few times just to make sure and there simply is no soundtrack.  Also this gives the indication that it is various parts of America but it is only Grand Canyon and Rocky Mt National Park.  Highly disappointing.  When I bought the TV there was a demo film running on it with the most beautiful landscapes.  I was hoping this was similar but it is a dud.",1423353600,,535,4.247524752475248
8600971,1,B00E4LALI2,"What a joke. The picture is stunning. The dry, boring voice over puts me to sleep. Too much repeated video.  Not worth 30 bucks.",1423353600,,128,4.333333333333333
