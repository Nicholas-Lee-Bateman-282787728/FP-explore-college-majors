2717461,4,B000LXHJUU,I read Men's Health occasionally and have always found it to be a good magazine.  A 15 min workout for men sounded good.  This program is not bad.  4 different workouts each with a different focus.  I like the idea of the short workouts.  If they could cut out some of the talk and just workout then it would be better to get more actual exercise time.,1225843200,5,352,4.1940298507462686
2717462,4,B000LXHJUU,"This DVD is broken down into four different workouts.  Each workout is about 15 minutes long, and you're meant to do the exercises while the video is playing although conceivably you could watch it and then take the routines to the gym too.  I have a home gym so this DVD was ideal for me.

The workouts were challenging and interesting, and some of the moves I had never done before.  I used lighter weights than I might normally would just to make sure that I had the routines down. The moves require a lot of concentration, endurance and perseverance.  I was surprised at how taxing they were.  I realized it more when I met a friend to play tennis and had trouble moving around the court because my legs were exhausted.  The leg workout is by far the best on the DVD.

My only drawback was that each workout is only two circuits or two sets so if you want to do the exercises longer, you have to restart the DVD.  But that's not a huge problem.  The filming of the DVD was pretty straight forward and down to earth.  No narcissistic men or women looking at themselves in the mirror and no weird stuff -- just straight up working out and how to do it right.",1218931200,11,1160,4.275229357798165
2717463,1,B000LXHJUU,A terrible video.  1/3 of it is standing around watching them talk among themselves taking a break.  I did not pay to watch people talk.  Save your money on this one.,1217635200,5,166,4.290322580645161
2717464,1,B000LXHJUU,"Purchased this dvd for my husband and son to use -- they wanted an ""all guy"" dvd so this seemed ideal. Gave to my teenage son to watch and he was shocked that it had sexual content promoted in it and furthermore the female instructor in the video further enhanced this concept as she looked more like she belonged on an x rated film and she would bend down to reveal her very unreal looking cleavage. It was tacky and tasteless -- and not necessary. We don't want a fitness video that does not show real women and that focuses more on feeding the visual desires of men and this is not what they want to be preoccupied with in their workouts. This was not a family friendly video and we are going to throw this one out. We were impressed with Tom Holland workouts and so for the moment the men in this home will have to stick with this until some more decent dvds are released.",1216080000,22,876,4.220238095238095
2717465,5,B000LXHJUU,"This is a great video. It includes 4 complete and different routines to follow and each are only 15 minutes long. The workouts are easy to follow and intensity can be increased by increasing the weights that you use. Knowing that it is only 15 minutes long makes it easier for me to stick to doing this on a regular basis. Who can't work in 15 minutes a day? (well, actually every other day is what you are supposed to do) The only complaint I might have is that the disclaimer at the beginning, which you cannot skip, is too long and I don't like having to wait for it to finish so I just turn it on and go to something else for a few minutes first.",1204416000,8,650,4.0859375
2717466,4,B000LXHJUU,"The intention of the producer is to provide one with a 15 minute workout. The problem is a significant portion of the time is spent explaining the routine.
Therefore, repeated viewings need to be fast forwarded past this replication. Otherwise, IMHO, all exercise videos have an up side.",1192579200,12,287,5.0
2717467,4,B000LXHJUU,So far I've used the video a few times and I have to admit it is a great way for me to squeeze in a workout at home!  I would recommend getting it if you have very little time and just need to do something when you have the chance!,1190505600,14,231,3.62
2717468,5,B000LXHJUU,"I saw this DVD on the internet and decided to give this a try.
To my surprise, these workouts can also be very beneficial to women as well! The ""Better Burn"" section totally put me on a sweat and trust me, with in a few weeks of doing it, you'd see very nice results. My endurance and overall muscle group totally improved.",1189296000,12,323,4.225806451612903
2717469,4,B000LXHJUU,"Let's face it: in a 15 minutes workout, you'll never look like the guy on the cover!
But if you're kind of out of shape and want to improve the way you look and the way you feel, this DVD will help you.
Do it every other day, alternating between ""a better burn"" and ""jump on it"", and I am almost positive that you'll see results within a few weeks. Not only results in the way you look (which is always nice) but mostly in your fitness level and the way you feel.
The audio/video quality of this DVD is very good and the instructor too.
As I said, do it 3-4 times a week, watch your diet if you need to, and by 6-8 weeks you should see improvements in your fitness level and the way your body looks.",1184025600,36,699,4.0
2717487,4,B000LXHJUU,I've used this a few times as a means to begin a workout program.  I find by completing 4-6 weeks of this I am in a good position physically to begin a weight training program.,1348012800,,176,4.0285714285714285
2717488,3,B000LXHJUU,Decent workout. Each 15 min segment only has 3 or so exercises. It's enough to get your heart-rate up but certainly not a workout for your whole body. I don't know why they couldn't add a bunch more segments....,1339372800,,211,4.435897435897436
2717489,2,B000LXHJUU,"The four workouts on this dvd are extremely simple, which might be what you're looking for. If you're a moderate athlete with little time to spare, the description is enticing, but the outcome is unremarkable. I've been rotating through the workouts each day for a couple weeks, and the only noticeable result has been soreness from one of the lower body exercises in ""Ground Force."" If you simply have no other way of being active, this is a good buy. Otherwise, be sure to integrate other exercises to the workouts. I've been adding push-ups and plank exercises after each workout, and they complement each other adequately.",1322784000,13,626,4.915094339622642
2717490,5,B000LXHJUU,"This is simply the most outstanding exercise video I've found. It works well with the Abs Diet approach which I'm following. I got this DVD free with Men's Health UK edition a couple of years ago. The 4 workouts are all good, but especially the ""Jump on it"" workout (called ""Explosive Power"" on my version). This combines strength training and cardio in one 15 minute session that'll leaves you sweating, pumped and ready to add additional exercises to round it out. It's motivating too. The instructor Terry Simpson offers sound encouragement and instruction. I know that when I do this workout after 15 minutes I will have performed a great strength and cardiovascular session and everything I do after that is a bonus. It's doesn't get boring either since you'll be fired up just keeping up with it.

Nothing is perfect, so a couple of criticisms:

1. This DVD doesn't seem to be for sale in the European format (PAL) which is a real shame. Rodale - do something about this, quickly, for all your European fans! (same criticism applies to the Abs Diet Workout 2 btw).

2. There is no mention of warming up or cooling down in the exercise sessions, so best to add these in yourself to avoid injuries and aid better muscle recovery.

Apart from that, extremely highly recommended!",1282608000,5,1281,4.7309417040358746
2717491,5,B000LXHJUU,"Bought this video in late 2009 and have been doing it in the mornings before work.  Yes, you will not look like the guy on the cover in fifteen minutes a day, but I can fit the fifteen minutes in in the morning and it makes the whole day better, it is a good workout and I feel like I am in better shape.  Many days after the fifteen minutes I will do more, so it is a good way to get started.  If it was thirty minutes I am sure many mornings I would talk myself out of it.  Definitely recommended.",1282262400,4,499,3.8627450980392157
2717492,5,B000LXHJUU,"I am 52 years old and am about 10 pounds from my weight loss goal.  As a result of a healthy diet and walking 2 miles a day I have gone from 221 pounds to 190 pounds in 6 months and am looking to lose 10 more pounds and burn off the rest of the belly fat and trim the abs.  At 52 years old, I realize that I will never look like the guy on the DVD case, but the ""Build Inner Strength"" workout section of this DVD is a perfect workout for me to help burn the belly fat and trim the abs.  All a person needs to do the ""Build Inner Strength"" workout is a floor to lay on....no weights or other exercise equipment is needed.",1274659200,12,620,3.7906976744186047
2717493,5,B000LXHJUU,"Not sure why some people felt it necessary to talk about the ""break"" times in the video. I thought they were good and necessary. Overall, I think this is a good workout routine to do at home or in your motel room if you are traveling. The exercises are explained and are a good, solid routine. The abs and core routine is challenging. I find that the 15 minute routine works very well as a whole or you can split the routines up into individual segments if you just want an ab and core workout, for instance. No silly distracting music, no ""boot camp"" garbage and no workout meant for women (ie; no embarrassing ""dance"" moves). Not overly macho, though. Just a good, workout DVD to get done and move on with your day. Highly recommended.",1273363200,5,737,4.426470588235294
2717494,5,B000LXHJUU,"I was doing another 15 minute exercise tape 6 months and it helped me to get in shape to do this one. This workout gives me a cardio workout, which I hate to do any kind of cardio, but this is only 15 minutes and I can do it. I don't use weights to do it just my fists. I learned a tightening technique from the other workout program so I don't need to use the weights to exercise my muscles. I just squeeze my fists while working out to tighten my muscles. I like that you workout ever other day. My least favorite, but I know most effective day is the Jump Rope day. I don't use a rope, but I jump. So you know, I weigh 270 pounds and have weak ankles. If I can jump anyone can. I just jump slower than others. I like that my heart races when doing these workouts. When I started I couldn't even sit up on the ab day. I would lift my shoulders off the ground and hold for the count of the sit up. Now, I can sit all the way up with my stomach muscles. This makes me feel real proud.",1269734400,6,984,3.852216748768473

8165162,5,B000LXHJUU,"""Men's Health 15-minute Workout"" is a very basic set of workouts designed to build strength. You decide how difficult the workouts are going to be by choosing the right weights. A set of weights is recommended but I did all the workouts using one 3-pound set of weights. Guys would of course use much heavier weights.

The four workouts on this DVD include:

A Better Burn - Squats, bench press and stationary lunge and row

Ground Force - Four lower body exercises including dumbbell deadlift, lunges, split squat and calf-raise Farmer's walk

Jump on It - This combines cardio and strength training. The exercises include dumbell deadlifts, push presses and jumping rope. You start with the heaviest weights and do less repetitions. Slowly you build up to more repetitions with less heavy weights. This allows you to keep good form.

Build Inner Strength - This works your core and the exercises include knee ups, sit ups and wrist-to-knee sit ups. I found this to be the most difficult exercise series.

Some things I wish had been included were a warm-up and a cool down stretch segment. But otherwise the exercises really worked me out and I broke out into a sweat when doing all four workouts in an hour. The thing I wish they had done was to include more exercises for the arms and back. However I did feel these exercises mostly in my lower back, abs and knees. So if you have a weak back or knees you may want to avoid these workouts or at least modify them slightly.

As far as sexual content goes there is none. Someone said there is but only the word ""sex"" comes up on the screen once before the menu page loads. The woman working out in this DVD is definitely eye candy but she keeps things serious. She does all the exercises with lighter weights than the guys do. I didn't find her offensive and I felt she looked typical as far as workouts go. So if you prefer to workout only with guys then you might not like this workout.

Women might want to steal this workout from their guys. But they might be annoyed by all the breaks given. You do need some patience to do this workout.
