5111570,5,B007VMSG4W,"Finally some prime MAGIC BAND footage in EXCELLENT quality & sound! First, some background from the press release:

""In 1972 Captain Beefheart released two albums; `The Spotlight Kid' and `Clear Spot'. He also toured the UK and Europe with the Magic Band, even performing two concerts at London's famed Royal Albert Hall. On April 12th, in the middle of the European leg of the tour, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART & THE MAGIC BAND stopped off at the BEAT CLUB studios in Bremen, Germany to film a session for later transmission. Of the five songs filmed that day only one track has ever been broadcast. The band at the time included: Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) vocals, harp; Rockette Morton (Mark Boston) guitar and bass; Zoot Horn Rollo (Bill Harkleroad) guitar; Orejon (Roy Estrada) bass; Ed Marimba (Art Tripp) drums; and Winged Eel Fingerling (Elliot Ingber) guitar. Author Jon Kirkman describes the recordings: ""The session kicks off with a bass solo entitled `Mascara Snake'. This short piece was named after a former member of the Magic Band Victor Hayden (Don's cousin), who had appeared on the `Trout Mask Replica' album. The solo is played by Mark Boston, although at this point former MOTHERS OF INVENTION bassist Roy Estrada had joined THE MAGIC BAND following his departure from LITTLE FEAT in early 1972. The other songs in the set here include a track dating back to `Trout Mask Replica' (`Steal Softly Thru Snow') and also a track that would be featured on `Clear Spot' some eight months later (`Golden Birdies').""

And now for my review: After pressing ""play"" the screen becomes blue. Then the sound of a bass playing a complicated solo envelops, maddeningly without video! After about a minute, the player appears. It's Mark Boston in a paisley suit, fedora and red shirt. The solo is amazing! It's definitely not totally improvised. Although what appears to be finger picks fly by, his thumb and forefinger are bare. His technique is very physical, but controlled. When done, the Captain appears. Slightly heavy, with an Elvis ""do,"" and goatee, he approaches the microphone and announces, ""Mascara Snake,"" then chuckles and mumbles ""Mascara Take."" Now the REAL fun begins! The familiar strains of ""Click Clack"" railroad rumble, and I get goosebumps! You get your first vision of Art Tripp playing his clear kit. He's wearing a monocle, panty doo-rag, green moustache and a shirt with large buttons on both sides of the closed seam that resemble those on and below the flap of manila envelopes that would be sealed by wrapping both with a string! His beat percolates, while Boston jives back and forth, now playing a red Telecaster. You get a quick glance of bushy Elliot Ingber on a Les Paul junior and Roy Estrada rockin' a white Fender bass. You can HEAR Bill Harkleroad's searing slide accents, but nervously ponder his visual absence. The Captain's vocals are steady as she goes, his harp producing delta shades. For a second you glance Harkleroad, a thin apparition in red suit and guitar (Gretsch? Guild? Gibson?) with real green bottle slide. A two minute outtake of ""Click Clack"" follows. Some better views of the band enhance ""Golden Birdies."" It may be new to the repertoire, but is tight and right. Beefheart then introduces the band. I'll take a minute here to digress about the editing. The picture and sound are fantastic for it's age, and the band performs in front of a ""blue screen."" But until the final song the editing can be maddening, few of the band members were shown during their introductions! Filmed with at least two cameras, the director seems obsessed with shots of Tripp, especially his left foot on the high-hat peddle seen through the clear bass drum. Now on to ""I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby."" Beefheart and the band really shine, tighter than the bush they keep beatin' around and tough as ""a Willy's in four-wheel drive."" His vocals throughout are at their bellerin' best! At the four and a half minute mark, a BEAT CLUB tech stops the song, and the Captain is none too happy, and exits stage left. This turns out for our benefit, since the boys lay it done even stronger, and the editor finally gets his strudel together and shows us the triple guitar-slingers tradin' riffs and grins until it's time for Don's reappearance. ""Steal Softly Through The Snow"" finds double layer Boston and Estrada basses, iced with the only appearance of the Cap's soprano saxophone stimulator. The sadly final tune is the familiar (to some) broadcast version of ""Booglarize,"" and it's obvious why this take was chosen. Professionally edited compared to everything else, the band together and individually get equal visual footing, and the famous BEAT CLUB psychedelic effects are judiciously used, complimenting instead of drowning. In summation, I'd grab this quick if I were you. Beefheart's estate is known for putting the ""kabosh"" on projects, and although this looks as legit as can be, you never know......

8522247,5,B007VMSG4W,"Multiple takes of some of the same songs but definitely worth it for fans. Don seems to be asking for more mic and less monitor during some of if not most of the songs. Disappointed that Steal Softly thru Snow is an instrumental as that is one of my favorites lyrically.
The bass solo is great as is the early take of Golden Birdies. This incarnation of the Magic Band really had the songs down and despite his issue with the sound Beefheart sounds great.",1376697600,11,455,4.364705882352941
8522248,4,B007VMSG4W,"I'm glad that this was published. Its great to see Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band from 1972. Steal Softly Thru Snow is from Trout Mask Replica, Golden Birdies from the then unrecorded or unpublished Clear Spot and two songs: Click Clack and I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby from their touring album Spotlight Kid. There is also a bass solo called Mascara Snake. The total running time of the music is 30 minutes and including a band introduction, two takes of Click Clack and three of I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby. All in all pretty cool.
The only downside is: during some of the songs the camera men aren't highly engaged. The good Captain is singing away and we're looking at the drummer or the bass player. This happens on a few of the songs and gets a bit irritating, hence the four stars. If you are a Beefheart fan, this is a must have for you. Newcomers should also experience the genius that was.",1350777600,16,908,4.509090909090909
