8325230,5,B000IJ7ALK,"This has to be one of the better of the Steam Around the World Series. The transfer quality, while not the best (see my Western European SATW review), is acceptable.

That said, this dvd delivers unbelievably rare footage of African steam locomotives, passenger cars, stations, etc.

Many countries are covered including South Africa, Mozambique, Ethiopia, The Sudan, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and others. The East African Railways (EAR) is covered in detail.

The main type of locomotive seen is the Garratt, which was very suited to Africa's geography. I didn't know the variety of this type that existed.

Harry Dodge apparently traveled to some very exotic places. Some of the more interesting images were of the Ethiopian steam locomotives decaying in the yards as well as the primitive and uncomfortable-looking passenger cars of the Sudan. The Sudanese railways closed down shortly after Harry Dodge filmed the line, as they could not deal with the cost and complexities of the diesels that replaced the steam engines.

All in all, if you can overlook the less-than spectacular transfer from tape to DVD, and if you are a real locomotive enthusiast, the images in this video are NOT to be missed! I doubt you will see these trains anyhwere else, and in such detail. For the price, you really can't go wrong.",1217721600,2,1308,5.009216589861751
