8205994,5,B000SMKK1E,"Reno 911 is ridiculously funny.  From the edgy racist funnies to the obscenity, it's downright hilarious.  I'm one to think that regular comedy isn't that funny without a little offensive nature to it.  This series is right up that alley.  Poking fun at the scum of the world in this satire of the hit show ""COPS"", Reno 911 sets the bar pretty high.  I love it, and if you like offensive humor, you will, too.",1352592000,,409,4.4
