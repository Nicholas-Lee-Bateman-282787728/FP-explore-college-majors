8446042,1,B004X4SG3M,The description didn't state that this DVD wouldnt work in the USA.  I obviously opened it up to watch the DVD to find out that this DVD did not work in United States would get an error code. When I contacted the seller they stated that they would not be able to refund me due to the package being open. How was I supposed to know that the DVD was not for the  United States DVD equipment.,1515456000,,389,4.038961038961039
