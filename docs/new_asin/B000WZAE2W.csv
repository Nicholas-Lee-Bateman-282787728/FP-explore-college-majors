Clearly drawing inspiration from Lynch and Altman (The Shining, Images)...midway, I had a sinking feeling it was trying to ""go there."" Impressively, it stays within the realm of the real, choosing instead to portray the weird/banal dance that artists do with their mind/life/work. Amazingly, there is also a beautifully nuanced relationship at the core of the movie...a tender, sweet, settled understanding between two men.  Ballroom is a significant artistic achievement, and a new personal fave.",1228694400,2,606,5.808988764044944
8226189,4,B000WZAE2W,"its not really like any movie of this genre that i've seen before.  I know that its kinda sort of based on a true story of the Bernard Brothers.  I don't know a lot more than that on them though.  But the movie itself while at times weird and strange in its own right.  It still somehow manages to keep me engaged and interested in finding out what these mysterious characters that keep popping up in the one characters view on the regular.  He thinks he's going crazy and it seems like it throughout the movie as it gets worse and he's taking meds to try and cope with this ""sickness"".  Which it really isn't suffice to say the movie isn't your average and that's a good thing for anyone that choses to watch this one and go all the way with it.

Ballroom is cool, different and yes strange but in this case it isn't a bad thing at all.",1206921600,,837,4.161490683229814
