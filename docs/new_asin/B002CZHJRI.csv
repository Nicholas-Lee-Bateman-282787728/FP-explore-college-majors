8364664,3,B002CZHJRI,"This DVD is inspiring, in the sense that it shows what a difference one life dedicated to God can do. There are a number of interviews with those close to Billy Graham, and some Crusade clips, but no interview with Billy Graham himself. It was actually done in a type of ""eulogy fashion"" that you might expect after Billy Graham has gone on to be with Lord.
I have seen just about every DVD honoring, or telling about the life and call of Dr. Graham, and I personally prefer the DVD ""God's Ambassador""as the most descriptive, and indepth of them all.",1365552000,,550,4.455445544554456
