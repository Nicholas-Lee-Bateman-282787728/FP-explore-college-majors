However, after viewing it in it's entirety, I am sufficiently satisfied that this is not a bad flick at all,,,the fight scenes were are well choreographed and the cinematography not bad.

This is a similar plot to the ""Prodigal Son',,with some difference,,,the story is also quite different.",1151712000,,924,4.941935483870968
