8181876,4,B000NVI2AG,"The Two Ronnies is pretty funny overall. The first two seasons they still seemed to be finding their way a bit but the chemistry between Barker and Corbett worked well. Unlike many comedy shows which tend to start strong the first season and slow down over time, the Two Ronnies only gained momentum as they went on. The first season had fewer skits than later seasons however season 1 is still worth getting.

I first saw the Two Ronnies on my local PBS station back in the 80's and found it really funny. They never did show the first few seasons though. The word play gags were great and I loved the short and fat jokes they tossed back and forth to each other.

Although not necessary to enjoy the show, some knowledge of  UK events and people of the time do help you better get some of the period jokes of the time.",1430265600,,820,4.311688311688312
8181877,5,B000NVI2AG,"The two Ronnies, and I use this as speaking of the people not the program, were excellent actors.  Ronnie Corbett, the smaller of the two, could make you laugh just watching his facial expressions.  Ronnue Barker, also known for his years in Porridge, was more of a spoken comedian.  He used words to make people laugh.

The Two Ronnies, now speaking of the program not the people, puts and pits the two Ronnies (people, not show) in interesting and often ridiculous situations.  Occasionally the used slapstick, a l Benny Hill, but mostly they used themselves vocally and through visual cues.

The Two Ronnies are guaranteed to make you laugh, IF you have the equipment in which to properly watch them.  (There is absolutely NO NEED to downgrade their star ranking because you failed to understand what you were buying.)",1423872000,,821,4.863309352517986
8181878,3,B000NVI2AG,"When I received the DVD it was not packaged well as all. When I opened it the box was badly cracked, the DVDs had been rolling around in the box and were badly scratched. I had to return this item. I got a full refund, they supplied the shipping label to ship it back so that was nice, it was at least a very simple process to return it. I did however end up getting another one because I couldn't find it anywhere else, even the second one I received the box was cracked, 1 of the discs was rolling around but luckily the discs were not scratched. They need to have packaging that it way better and have a DVD case that the DVDs won't fall out. I was not a happy camper. I was just glad the second one was scratched. It was a miracle.",1390348800,,735,4.006802721088436
8181879,1,B000NVI2AG,"Apparently it means only viewable in Europe which I used to know by such terms as PAL and SECAM so though I truly loved watching THE TWO RONNIES when I lived in UK, have been unable to watch this one because the format is not viewable in US.  But would always recommend watching any of their shows because they are freaking hilarious.",1389830400,,334,4.387096774193548
8181880,3,B000NVI2AG,"Why can't we here in the USA get these classics on DVD?  The Two Ronnies was one of my favorite shows on PBS on Sunday nights.  I also remember  Up Pompeii and others.  If the DVDs are offered in other regions, please also make them available for all regions.  Don't tell me that I should buy a region- free player.  All my DVD players work fine and I refuse to buy another player.  I am not the only one here who loves these shows.  You would sell a lot of these sets if you just make them available.",1370476800,3,501,4.040816326530612
8181881,4,B000NVI2AG,"I always enjoy seeing episodes of the Two Ronnies. On PBS television in the USA, the musical numbers were edited out leaving just the comedy.
 Now that I own a DVD player capable of playing discs in the PAL
system, I can see the whole program. However the musical numbers
are generally quite mediocre except those where the Two Ronnies
participate.",1335830400,,348,4.704918032786885
8181882,4,B000NVI2AG,"After the two rather unsatisfying `best of' DVD's, it was with some satisfaction that I heard this entire series one was being released.
This is where it started, way back in 1971.  And although the duo are definitely not firing on all 4 cylinders yet, this is still fine entertainment.
Each episode contains some mixture of the following ingredients:
1) The opening prologue, in which the duo deliver `some news items just in'.  Hit and miss, but classic humor - you'll be sure to find something to make you laugh.
2) The state of the party - almost every episode had a party sketch - including `bald man at a party' and the man at a party who can't stop hitting people.
3) New World - - the guest musical trio.. and you'll be shocked / amazed just how dated and 70's they are!
4) Hampton Wick - the faux drama serial in which the unbelievably nave buxom heroine gets into all sorts of situations, most of the displaying her impressive attributes in a Benny Hill sort of way.
5) Tina Charles - please, please, do yourself a favour and skip past this musical guest -a  young lady who wears the most hideous outfits known to man woman or beast and belts out come completely forgettable tunes with no grace whatsoever.
6) Ronnie Corbett's monologue - in this series it has to be said few of the monologues have any decent punchlines, and are still stilted and unsatisfying, but they have their moments and introduce the format for what was to come.
7) Various sketches - most of them playing to Ronnie Barker's incredible gift for word plays - the highlight of this entire series is probably his speech to the groom and bride.
8) The occasional cabaret act - not one of them worth watching, I am afraid.
9) The Musical number - actually still witty for the most part, and because they are parodies have not dated badly.
10) And the final epilogue - in which we hear a few jokes on supposed items due on next week, and a few items of late breaking news.

It's not 100% Gold, so treat the 5 star reviews with some trepidation.  That's the nostalgia talking.  But classic, it is, and worth adding to the collection to get those gems of sketches that cannot be found anywhere else.  If only they made the menus easier to find the ones you like!  Also - no extras or interviews which would cast an interesting light on the origins of the series.  Writers included Eric Idle every week, and some of the other Python members occasionally - it would have been nice to hear something from them now, looking back.
Overall, it is patchy enough to make you wish that you could choose your own `best of' DVD - but that's the beauty of The Two Ronnies.. everyone has their own favorite parts of their repertoire, and while season one is not their high point, it's a great introduction and appetizer for what is to come.
It's an average series then, but raised to 4 stars by the incomparable Ronnie Barker.",1195862400,13,2889,4.466793168880455
