8292382,5,B001D9HEYW,"It was an excellent documentary of the attack and capture of the U-505 and the significance of the capture was how
it excelerated the destruction of the U-Boat naval menace during WWII.  I am very familiar with the history in
capturing the U-505 since my Dad was the sonar man aboard the destroyer escort, the USS Chatalein, that first detected the sub  and began the depth charge attack that damaged and brought the sub to the surface. My Dad talks briefly on the film about the sonar contact.",1372032000,,494,4.6022727272727275
