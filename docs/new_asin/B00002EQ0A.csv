7915872,5,B00002EQ0A,"The two tapes in this set are fantastic.  The first, Pleasure at Her Majesty's gives you not only the premier names in British Comedy, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, Peter Cook, The Goodies, Rowan Atkinson and more, it also gives you a behind the scenes look at discussion on changing lines, pre-performance jitters, and Terry Jones's padded underwear.  The second is just as hilarious as the first, particularly hilarious is the Terry Jones's pepperpot, Mrs. Simon Yetigoosecreature being walloped by the celebrity guest while John Cleese gives clues to the celebrity's identity.  A must-have if you care for British comedy at all.",975369600,,673,5.271028037383178
