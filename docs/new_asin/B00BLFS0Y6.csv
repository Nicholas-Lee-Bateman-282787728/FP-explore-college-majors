8570389,2,B00BLFS0Y6,"Low budget, gaping plot holes, and not particularly coherent, but the two young actresses do well.  Taking liberally from films like Ringu and Ju-On, the film relies on point of view filming and character tension and confusion rather than special effects.  Unfortunately it just doesn't sustain thru the full 90 minutes.  Good if you just want to kill an evening.",1444003200,,363,5.016666666666667
