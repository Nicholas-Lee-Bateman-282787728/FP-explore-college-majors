2042797,3,B0001XLWDK,Amanda Righetti is nude and HOT!!!  The movie is basically a not very well acted erotic slasher movie.  But it is the only one that Amanda is nude in and for her fans that is a plus!,1357171200,5,182,3.891891891891892
2042798,3,B0001XLWDK,"Not a great movie, but a young Amanda Righetti is always good.
The acting is passable, but the plot suffers.
But again, Amanda Righetti is in the movie.",1334534400,3,152,4.464285714285714
2042799,1,B0001XLWDK,"Aww bad bad movie.

The start got my attention a little bit, it was hard not to get to attention in the first two minutes. Oh that is one nice, oh they are nice, wow. But then all the bad blood effects, it looked like Peter North but he was shooting red and real slow too. Stupid. Then all the ugly guys. Yikes. There were some seriously hot chicks in this movie. Seriously hot. But darn it, the fast forward button couldn't work fast enough to not hear all the stupid bad line reading.

OK, so that OC chick, Amanda Righetti. Wow, she is seriously hot. And thank goodness she is naked a lot in this. A lot. But darn it, you have to look at that ugly David Heavener with her. Oh, so much shrinkage. Here's one to watch for, Hillary Crouse. Yep, she was Heavener's wife in this, and oh what a beautiful woman. Margot Kidder is all shriveled up and she reads her lines too.

Just for the Amanda scenes, this isn't worth watching. You'll wear out the fast forward button. A guy in his back yard with a video camera could have done better than this. There's even a stupid making of bonus thing on the DVD - you kidding me? Heavener talks about how hard he worked on this. Yikes. He just wanted to look at Amanda.

Oh this is supposed to be an erotic thriller. If you ever saw one episode of Scooby Doo, you know who did it. Shaggy hangs out with a naked Amanda Righetti, wow. Shaggy is one lucky dude. All you get, soft core, only breasts and butts, nothing else. No felines, no roosters, no completion. It's all kind of not so great.",1326326400,,1530,4.21160409556314
2042800,5,B0001XLWDK,"David Heavener stars, writes, directs and produces this great movie of fascinating nudity, crime and suspense. Heavener is great in his role and Amanda Righetti is sexy and I mean SEXY! She is in the greatest of nude through the whole pacing of the movie. Damn she is fine! I give this movie a 5 out of 5 rating.",1250035200,2,312,4.305084745762712
2042801,2,B0001XLWDK,This is nothing like the old anime series. The acting was so so at best. the story line was bad.,1222214400,,96,3.85
2042802,3,B0001XLWDK,"ANGEL BLADE has a very NEIGHBOR SHOT ANOTHER MOVIE look to it.

The script is very poorly tuned. Many times the dialogue sounds very unrealistic. I mean... who says to someone... ""What do you want Lieutenant?""  Come on, show us that he's a cop with visuals, you don't have to write that in. Nobody talks like that. This is just one example. There are many.

The acting is at times... good... at times bad... but mostly forgettable.

David Heavener writes, directs and STARS in ANGEL BLADE, and honestly, he should have just stayed behind the camera and done a better job shooting and noticing that a lot of the dialogue is unrealistic and frivolous. He is a less than attractive star and he not only has a very attractive ex-wife, but he gets to bump uglies with the SMOKIN HOT AMANDA RIGHETTI (from the O.C., North Shore & Reunion).

Actually... I guess I probably would have written myself into the role too.

I guess it's time to get to the good stuff about ANGEL BLADE. Did I mention that AMANDA RIGHETTI was in the movie? I did, didn't I? She's in it... a lot. She's naked a lot. She looks fantastic. She's naked a lot. Did I already say that? Yeah. She is... and she looks great.

Okay... you get the point. But, to be real, ANGEL BLADE actually has some cool twists and turns in it. There was a time when I thought they were twisting and turning a little too much, but I was actually surprised a couple of times and actually really liked how the movie played out.

Although, the very end was a tad, not to give anything away, but open ended and disappointing.

Don't get me wrong... it's a bad movie. But, it's not ALL BAD. It's sort of a C-grade Basic Instinct with AMANDA RIGHETTI being her drool inspiring self.",1152489600,19,1721,4.420886075949367

8017983,4,B0001XLWDK,"An okay movie with an over-used plot and acting at the B-movie level at best.  Men will like the women, especially the women who are nude.  Amanda Righetti, who is now in the TV show ""The Mentalist"", looks fabulous both with and without her clothing.

Good DVD disc, picture and sound.",1360368000,,285,4.549019607843137
