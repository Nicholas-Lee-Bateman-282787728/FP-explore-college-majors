1849188,4,B00008HCAB,"I enjoyed the movie (DVD) immensely, but I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the movie in that it is 'hopelessly' stuck in 1973 (the year I graduated high school). The music, the costumes, and the bad 1970s hairstyles detract considerably from what was supposed to be a universal theme. I suppose if it could be remade today, in 2052 someone will be saying it was stuck in 2012.

What this movie should forever be preserved for is the tour-de-force performance of Zero Mostel and the frozen-in-time performance of his transformation into a rhinoceros - which won him a Tony Award in the stage version and can never be successfully repeated or copied by anyone. Thank you film producers for capturing it on film for all of us to enjoy over and over again many years later.

Gene Wilder is amazing - one for co-starring against Zero twice in his lifetime, but also for the 'spin' on his characterization of the 'lone man' who watches everyone around him turn into a rhinoceros. He could have been boring, but isn't.

I hate to say it, but Karen Black was about as interesting as the lettuce Zero was eating. Even in this 'movie of the absurd' her performance is strained. Her head is always 'down' and you see nothing but forehead and the whites of her eyes. No idea why she was cast in this movie.",1329091200,3,1310,4.5423728813559325
1849189,4,B00008HCAB,"The film 'Rhinoceros' is based on a play by Ionesco. It is most suitable for mature age educated people. I saw it when I was much younger and couldn't make much out of it. It is part of what has been called the 'Theatre of the Absurd', requiring acceptance that a lot of what we do doesn't make a lot of sense. In particular people readily conform to pointless and dangerous views. The background to the play is the rise to power of the Romanian fascist movement, the 'Iron Guard'. It is more satire than straight comedy.",1294963200,3,521,4.381443298969073
1849190,5,B00008HCAB,"This is a rare treat. I waited a long time to see this once more. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are a fantastic duo. This tops ""The Producers.""",1227052800,,141,4.071428571428571
1849191,1,B00008HCAB,"This is a dreadful film which shows little understanding of the playwrights original intention and particularly the humor inherent in the original script.  Instead the director and cast go for mugging, pratfalls and a wild and now hopelessly outdated ""60's"" feeling -",1179273600,6,267,5.357142857142857
1849192,2,B00008HCAB,"One would think that the combination of Eugene Ionesco, Zero Mostel, and Gene Wilder would be a guaranteed success. Sadly, such is not the case with the American Film Theatre production of ""Rhinoceros"" as committed to film in 1974. While the theme of maintaining one's identity as everyone else goes along with the herd (originally a metaphor for Nazism, McCarthyism, etc.) is intact, Ionesco's text has been so altered that is is destroyed. Here it becomes subject to slapstick, poor unfunny added situations, exaggerated performances, and clumsy direction. The film has been criticized for ""staginess,"" but that is not the real problem. It makes use of camera movement, external sets, etc.; it just has no rhythm. It is a trial to get through it--certainly not the case with Ionesco's original, either on stage or as read to one's self. Gene Wilder is always diverting but the character he portrays has been so tampered with that it's just unpleasant and tedious. Karen Black's character is an embarrassment as are all the other minor characters. The only bright spot in this mess is Zero Mostel, whose fifteen minutes on screen are amazing, his transformation from a dandified fussbudget into a destructive rhinoceros an acting tour-de-force; done without makeup, it encapsulates the essence of the piece. But that's it: the other ninety minutes are dreary and awful.

The DVD is very well transferred, but the extras are disappointing: e.g., an ""interview"" with Zero Mostel is simply text to be read frame by frame, and an article about Ionesco and the play is simply an on-screen text repetition of the liner notes. There is a very long interview with the director, in murky sound; after seeing his incompetence demonstrated in this film, no one will have any desire to see him drone on about it.",1153699200,11,1801,4.983388704318937
1849193,5,B00008HCAB,"I first saw this adaptation in a college film class and have been trying to get a VHS or DVD since. Yes, it is supposed to be funny, but funny odd not funny ha-ha. Absurdist theater takes normal behaviors and exaggerates them so we see how weirdly we act and how distorted our values sometimes are. The character Zero Mostel plays is fastidious in his morals and attire, but even he changes. The character Gene Wilder plays resists to the end, but has to admit the sound of a rhinoceros is stranglely compelling. Are our civilized behaviors just neurotic expression or are we really superior to animals? Oh, by the way, I do find this movie ha-ha funny. But maybe it's a matter of taste.",1075939200,7,687,4.504
1849194,4,B00008HCAB,"One of the great things about this DVD is that it includes an interview, taped in 2002, with the film's director, Tom O'Horgan. (He was the guy responsible, along with Galt McDermot, for the original Hair on Broadway).  Among other things, O'Horgan talks about the conversion of the original Eugene Ionesco play into a cnematic version, giving great credit to the screenwriter, Julian Barry.
And with good reason.  While Ionesco is one of the great absurdist playwrights, his sensibility is decidedly European.  This means that the sense of humor expressed in the original play would very likely fall on deaf (American) ears, to a large extent.  What the screenwriter has done is to essentially Americanize the dialogue, making it truly hilarious in many scenes.
And of course it helps to have a great cast.  The two leads, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, are perfect for their roles, especially Mostel who is funny enough to make you micturate in your trousers, if you catch my drift.  Seen first as a man overly concerned with appearance and manners, he descends, in the course of the film, to the level of the titular creature.
The story is of a small town which is beset by a bizarre plague, if one can call it that--the transforming of humans into rhinos. Ionesco was commenting on the radical changes occurring in society as the Cold War became a reality--meaning, more than anything else, as people had much more to be afraid of than they did before.  Fear makes us lose our rationality, become less human.  Even become rhinoceri.
This is a really funny film that is just as good now--maybe even better--than it was when originally released in 1974.  In supporting roles, Percy Rodriquez and Joe Silver are especially good--staunch representatives of corporate America.  Karen Black does a great job as a sexy woman who Stanley (Gene Wilder) works with and is smitten with and eventually anguishes over as he is the sole remaining human in a town full of rhinos.
Much, much better than you might think.  Definitely recommended.",1063411200,32,2031,4.875
1849195,4,B00008HCAB,"Stanley is a bored, alcoholic young man who feels disconnected from the rest of society.  His best friend John is contstantly trying to help him to fit in and get over his feelings of awkwardness.  One Sunday morning, while the two are at a restaurant, a rhinoceros rampages through the streets.  Soon, Stanley notices more and more rhinoceroses and begins to realize that everyone in town is turning into them.  Determined not to change, he confronts John with the problem only to watch his transformation in a rhino.  As the rest of the world changes, including Daisy, the woman of his dreams, Stanley desparately tries to transform, but realizes that he can't and that he won't.
This is a good adaptation of the absurdist play by Eugene Ionesco and changes the setting from a small French town to a big US city.  Wonderful performances by Gene Wilder as Stanley and Karen Black as Daisy; and a standout performance from Zero Mostel as Stanley's friend John.  Tom O'Horgan's direction is definitley unique, making it feel as though the viewer is watching a stage play.  The only drawback is the bad '70s music that doesn't fit.
The DVD has some great extras including an interview with Tom O'Horgan, an interview with Zero Mostel, information about Eugene Ionesco, and the original movie trailer, to name a few.  The trailer gives an idea of how the studio marketed this film as a comedy, even though it views more along the lines of a drama or a very, very dark comedy.
Having read the play in college, I enjoyed this adaptation.  If you enjoy a movie that makes you think, then this is definitely the movie for you.",1059264000,15,1619,4.689045936395759
1849196,5,B00008HCAB,"I guess I can understand how some folks don't like Ionesco or this play in particular.  I have quirky taste.  If you like Tim Dorsey or Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiassen, you might like this.  I watched it by myself on television long about 1976 or so and almost died laughing.
The film is strangely up to date and topical too, with a kind of virus sweeping New York (IIRC).  It's a stagey piece, with the two main actors providing almost all the energy.  New Yorkers, being New Yorkers, have varying responses to crises, which is part of the fun.
And the virus itself is a barely disguised version of what really has gripped our nation since this play was written.  Everyone should see it at least once.

1849204,4,B00008HCAB,"First: You need to understand what you are watching in order to enjoy this movie.  I spent the first thirty minutes wondering what the heck i was watching and why was nothing funny.

Then I read up on the movie and what it was about.  Once I understood what I was watching, this became a very good movie.  Gene Wilder is not a ha ha funny funny comedian.  Even in some of his funniest movies, you can see that he doe not act like a Jim Carey or a slapstick comedian.  Think of him as a Micheal Keaton or Johnny Depp.  These folks perform comedy like it is a serious art and you should not be laughing unless you understand why you should be laughing.  (deep, I know)

Anyways, read up on the fact that this was adapted from a play and is kind of a reverse comedy (absurd) I think is what they say.  Even kind of, if not exactly what a Dark Comedy is supposed to be.

People like the dark comedies that Jim Carey has been in, because his humor comes across very easy.  Harder to like are the dark comedies where a goofy person is not playing the main role.  I never thought Gene Wilder was goofy.  Eccentric, maybe.

Nero's Performance was masterful and I was amazed.  Understand what he is trying to get across on screen and then you can see how incredible it was.

In other words, this is the theatre of the absurd where and everyday man serves as a foil to the craziness of the world.  It is supposed to often be funny in a traditional way, but it is also supposed to be profound.  Not everyone will find it funny despite excellent performances by Wilder and Mostel.  Of those who do, the absurdity might still be too much to take in one sitting
  The themes are the traditional ones of existentialists (Sartre and others) and absurdists (Camus's term).  That is, how can we find meaning in the world after the Holocaust and WWII?  How can one live an authentic life?  What is a moral life?
  I gave it only four stars because it was a little long for me.  When I broke it into separate settings of about 30 minutes each, however, it well repaid the effort.  If absurdity is not your bag of tea or if you are looking for Blazing Saddles, then I would not recommend this film unless you want to try something new.",1435708800,4,1121,4.383495145631068

Next, let me say that this movie fell very short of the caliber of movies that Gene has made. I tried to watch the whole thing, but I just couldn't. The movie felt fragmented to me; just could not find the flow in it, and for that, I was sad, but, hey, everyone makes a flop at some point in their careers, right? I have forgiven him, as I hope he has forgiven himself. Haha.

It's not that I didn't like his acting, because even when I just look at him, I at least smile, if not rolling on the floor in an abundance of laughter.

The movie is weird, bizarre, one that you either enjoy or detest.  But I enjoyed it.

I thought that the acting and general appearance of the film looked stagy, or revealed the theatrical origins of the play by Ionesco.
But that was often the case with films released by the 'American Film Theater' company.

The theme of the film is individualism versus collectivism, with the people who succumb to brainwashed, faceless, collectivism turning in to rhinoceroses.

7984941,5,B00008HCAB,"A complex American re-write of a French-language play from a Romanian playwright, Rhinoceros is a satire which tells the story of an anxious, alcoholic man facing an increasingly grim future as he quickly becomes the last individual man alive, and the rest of the human race becomes rhinoceros and ""join the herd.""

Transplanted from small town France to large city America, the story is otherwise largely intact, with Gene Wilder playing the protagonist Stanley, and Zero Mostel reprising his role as the protagonist's best friend. Mostel won the Tony for Best Actor in the Broadway production of the original play, and it's unsurprising that he steals the show again with his grand, ridiculous portrayal of Jean/John, and his uncomfortably elaborate movements and voice changes as he ""transforms"" from man to rhinoceros without a bit of special effects.

The play itself is a complicated one, and bringing it to the big screen was doubtless a huge challenge. The major tone changes throughout the movie doubtless left audiences wondering, as the slapstick grew increasingly more over-the-top until a crescendo which shifted the movie toward a downer ending, as Gene Wilder's character notes grimly, that people who hang on to their individualism too long come to ""a bad end,"" even as he resolves to continue doing so.

Already a bit removed from its 1950's Theater of the Absurd origins by its transition from play to movie and French town to US city, the 1970s release puts this movie even further away from its intended, post-war audience, though even generations later the underlying themes of conformity and herd mentality ring just as true.",1464134400,4,1647,5.115241635687732

I lasted only 20 minutes before realizing that the movie was made for and by people on acid, and that that makes perfect sense since it came from that drugged-out decade between the late 60's and 70's.  My advice?  Don't bother, unless you're 40 years behind the times.",1463961600,,352,4.555555555555555
