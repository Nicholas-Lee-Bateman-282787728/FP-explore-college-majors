1596074,3,B00005JPNY,"While I did like the CGI and all the animals, The Golden Compass felt like a mess to me. The lead girl was good, but the other characters weren't fleshed out in the least. The plot was a little on the boring side, so with all these flaws I can see why the critics are more negative than positive. The ice bears were pretty cool, I give it that, but this movie isn't as good as the Harry Potter films, and miles away from The Lord of the Rings.",1197072000,5,443,3.9887640449438204

It moves quickly,so be warned.
I must say, that with all of the senseless furor that has surrounded this film from groups that admit they have not seen it,I found it ludicrous to see why this film should upset anyone. Whether or not the original author's intent was to expose the ""indoctrinational"" thinking and effects of religion, the fact that this film is so beautifully crafted and acted, especially in the character of Lyra Bellaqua,aptly and deftly portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, is a testament to modern day film making with the ability to tell a very compelling story. I saw this film with six adults and fourteen children! We all went out afterwards and had a discussion about the film. I was astounded that the children did not see this film as an attack on religion,as much as they saw it as their need to always scrutinize things,to think for themselves and that a promise to a friend is a bond! Now I think that is a set of great lessons for kids to take away from a movie! I think they got the point that many naysayers seem to be missing! Stop hearing all of the fuss and hubbub that wants you to not see this film (99% of it adult), and decide for yourself. I feel quite encouraged with the fourteen kids that saw this film with me. They are the hope of the future from authoritarianism. I don't think anyone's ""religion"" is in danger;except perhaps from those who are the most insecure about their own footing in life.",1196985600,8,1882,5.093851132686084
1596076,4,B00005JPNY,"A rich, yet streamlined adaptation of Philip Pullman's ""The Golden Compass"" has finally hit the screen, and boy is it a doozie! The cinematography is dazzling ,the story is complex yet absorbing, and finally a fantasy tale,that encourages children and adults to wake up and guard the one precious gift they have been given-their minds!!!
Writer/director Chris Weitz along with his production designer Dennis Gassner have recreated Pullman's world of dogmatic institutions and the rebellious free thinking world with a hodge-podge of Edwardian and Victorian industry and architecture. This is the only place where I feel the film lacks. We never have much chance to rest and gaze upon this marvel of set design and this ""mythical world"" because the story simply runs at a breakneck pace in order to tell the story of the the ""rough-edged diamond"",12-year-old Lyra (the name of the beautiful harp whose dulcet tones could subdue angry kings in the Bible!) whose acute perspective keeps her from being swallowed alive by having her ability to think for herself destroyed. She navigates her way through this maze of oppressive authoritarianism. The fact that Nicole Kidman's character is named ""Mrs. Coulter"" got me to laughing thinking about the ultra conservative ""journalist"" Ann Coulter who seems to be the mouthpiece for modern day non-free thinking!!!( Oh, that comment will be sure to upset! OUCH!)
Yes, this film is rooted in the deep allegories of questioning religious authority, but if you allow yourself a moment to put aside your bisases,no matter what they are, ""The Golden Compass"" can point you in the direction that says ""decide for yourself-question what is told to you-do not take things at face value-keep yourself YOU at all costs"".This is a lesson that this reviewer hopes all can learn from this film! Frankly, as a person who navigated my way out of years of authoritarian thinking, I welcome this book and movie with open arms. Long live the open mind with all of it's God-given possibilities (at least if you believe in God....you don't have to, ya know!)",1196985600,12,2077,5.058309037900875
1596077,5,B00005JPNY,"I had seen not one, but two, articles in MAJOR newspapers attacking the Golden Compass by reactionary Roman Catholic organizations before it was even released! What alarms me most is that secular newspapers are printing articles asking people not to watch this movie on religious grounds! I find that quite astonishing! I'm sure there are numerous religious groups that would like the public not to watch, or read, something because it's against their beliefs. What I'd like to find out is why these outrageous attacks on The Golden Compass are being printed as hard news, instead of being delegated to the editorial page where it's appropriate to express one's beliefs!

And I'd also love to know what public relations firms these Catholic organizations were using because it appears to be an extremely well-orchestrated effort!

The Dark Materials trilogy is some of the most profound pieces of literature I have had the good fortune to read in my entire life! It's on par with the Lord of the Rings as far as emotional depth is concerned. While the movie can never capture the endless rich nuances of the book - it was a good try.

I enjoyed all three books in the trilogy, but The Golden Compass is just a warm-up for the next two books, which will knock your socks off. The theology and imagination that runs through this trilogy is absolutely subversive and incredibly moving. It will drive conservatives crazy because it attacks religious authoritarianism with such mind-boggling intensity. Something truly unparalleled in modern fantasy literature.

My concern while driving home after watching this movie is simply this - will the next two sequels be neutered by Hollywood because it will drive conservatives within the Catholic church bonkers? I hope the author, Philip Pullman, makes sure this does not happen. I would rather see this be the first, and last, Dark Materials trilogy film if some weenies up in Hollywood Central intends to sterilize the remaining story by ripping out its heart and soul!

1596078,3,B00005JPNY,"Ok I'll say it wasn't a bad movie. As people have said the acting wa great and the animation was awesome, I especially liked Pantalimon aka Pan. I wish they hadn't moved the Bolvangar scene to after the Svalbard scene but I can live with it because they were well done. But, what really bugged me is why they left out the most gripping part of the book, the ending. I mean the revelation of how crazy Azriel is is one of my favorite part. They shouldn't have left out his kidnapping poor Roger and Lyra's attempt to rescue him and they should have left in the opening of the gate and the romantic talk between Coltier and Azriel at the gate. That was my big beef with the movie and they had better put it in the Subtle Knife movie or I will be mad. Oh yeah, the only other thing that truly bugged me was Lyra finding the Costa boy separated from his daemon, It was not him in the book it was Tony Makarios and his daemon was Ratter not the Costa boy's. Ok, I guess I've said enough.",1196985600,,982,4.119791666666667
1596079,5,B00005JPNY,"The special effects and the cinematography of ""The Golden Compass"" are wonderful, but it's the subtext that really shines through, making for one of the most unique, fascinating, and entertaining fantasy films of recent memory. Just as it is in the film, the plot of Philip Pullman's original novel suggested that free will was kept under strict control. The film brings this idea to the surface and allows the audience to analyze it; in a parallel universe--in which a person's soul is separate and physically represented by an animal--a ruthless organization called the Magisterium tries to enforce rules against free will. Anyone who challenges its authority will be condemned as a heretic. Because they wanted to ensure total compliance, the Magisterium sought to destroy every last alethiometer, or golden compass--a magical, watch-like mechanism that literally tells the truth by pointing at strange symbols.

The one alethiometer that survived is now in the possession of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a college professor who defies the Magisterium by confirming the existence of dust. I'm not referring to the allergy-inducing particles that settle on ordinary surfaces; I'm referring to the magical substance that's somehow related to a rift between their universe and ours. Because this has put him at odds with the Magisterium, he gives the alethiometer to his orphaned niece, Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl raised by the professors at a university. Lyra, who absolutely hates being called a lady, is clever, bold, and incredibly headstrong, with an adventurous spirit that occasionally gets her into trouble. Her spirit--or daemon, as referred to by the characters--is Pan (voiced by Freddie Highmore), who hasn't quite decided which animal form to take. He spends most of his time as a ferret, but he also turns into a cat, a bird, and a mouse.

When Lyra hears that her uncle is traveling to the snowy north to find the dust and open this cross-dimensional rift, she wishes to join him. Asriel refuses to let her, and he warns her against speaking of dust to anyone. Here enters Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), the wicked, controlling head of the Magisterium; she quickly learns that the alethiometer is in Lyra's possession and vows to reclaim it by tricking Lyra onto her good side. Mrs. Coulter's true nature is soon revealed, and upon escaping, Lyra is put under the protection of the Gyptians, a band of rebels who were once aided by Lord Asriel. As they journey north with Lyra, she also meets: Serafina (Eva Green), an elegant, almost ethereal witch; Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), a grizzled pilot who speaks like a Texan from the Old West; and Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen), a disgraced polar bear who was once a great warrior among an entire clan of polar bears. To rid himself of his shame, he decides to reclaim his stolen armor and protect Lyra at whatever cost.

This is pretty much the foundation for the adventure that follows, an adventure so big that it isn't over even when the movie ends. But in the grand scheme of things, the adventure is fairly superficial and only part of what makes it so wonderful; ""The Golden Compass"" is just as thought provoking as it is enjoyable, filled to the brim with intelligent, meaningful undertones. This isn't to say that the film exists entirely as one big commentary--a good portion of it functions at a level of pure entertainment, from the convincing special effects to the stunning set designs to the fantastic mechanical creations. The story is not one of the future, the past, or even the present; its unique setting has essentially made any sense of time meaningless. And let's not forget a number of lighthearted moments between Lyra and her best friend, Roger (Ben Walker), both of whom are more like bonded siblings.

But there is a dark side to this story. For one thing, the Magisterium is involved in a sinister plot to kidnap children and sever the connections between them and their daemons. The sooner they lose their spirits (pun definitely intended), the quicker they can be controlled. There's also a general sense of foreboding that runs through the entire film, as if to say that certain things are not as simple as they may first appear. Consider the fact that a person's physical pain is also felt by his or her daemon, and vice versa: What exactly will happen if one of them dies? Can one exist without the other? And how exactly are daemons a threat to free will?

The fact that I'm asking these questions is a good thing, because it proves that ""The Golden Compass"" is a stimulating film. Rarely is a fantasy story allowed to transcend the limiting clichs of princesses, castles, dragons, swords, and predictable Hero's Journeys. Here's a film that actually brings something new to the genre, something fresh, exciting, daring, and determined. This is not a mind-numbing rehash; it's a thoroughly original experience, highlighted by delightful performances, a solid structure, and a well-rounded social commentary. I suppose I should make a note about the Catholic Church's poor reception of this film, but why bother? Religion--or lack thereof--has nothing to do with it. It has everything to do with being engaging, smart, and imaginative.",1196985600,198,5252,4.984036488027366

1596081,3,B00005JPNY,"The movie adaptation of The Golden Compass should please most people if they had not read the book. I haven't.

Based on the first of three Philip Pullman's books in the trilogy of his Dark Materials, the Northern Lights, this is a whimsical tale of how a precociously unconventional girl is set on a task to free children who are about to be separated from their personal dmon after receiving a mysterious golden compass. The golden compass which is an alethiometer. which seeks to help tell find the truth to the puzzles on her journey. Along the way, she discovers grave conspiracies and receives help from the Egyptians, the witches as well as the an armoured bear.

Dakota Blue Richards who play the orphaned girl, Lyra Belacqua, is excellent in her part due to the maturity she displays as the quick-witted Lyra. While the film also bills Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman as the main draw, both have substantially less screen time as Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter respectively. However, Kidman as Mrs Coulter is maleficent and unscrupulous with her equally demonic dmon, a golden monkey. Kidman's eyes possesses the kind of menace that is intended to kill.

The film does suffer at having to adapt a large amount of the book into 2 hours. Characters are introduced swiftly and the audience is expected to know them well. However, the splendid acting and CGI effects do compensate some of that inadequacy.",1196812800,2,1406,4.825726141078838
1596082,4,B00005JPNY,"Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is a stubborn girl who wants to be included in the adventures of her uncle, the Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig). For one particularly important mission Lord Asriel heads to ""The North,"" and again Lyra is left behind. Her savior comes in the form of a woman, the Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who says she is about to travel to the North and could use an assistant. For safety on her voyage with Mrs. Coulter, Lyra is given a strange instrument and told to keep it a secret. The instrument is an Alethiometer and if you can read it, it always shows you the truth. With the help of the Alethiometer and some new friends she meets along the way, Lyra must find and save kidnapped children and then find her uncle.

The movie is based on the world created by Philip Pullman in the His Dark Materials series, a three-book set with The Golden Compass being the first. While I have not read the books, I will assume that much of the movie was as it was in the books. For example, I will credit Pullman with the dmons -- in this parallel world a person's soul travels alongside the body, in animal form, rather than inside it. This was a wildly imaginative element to the story and one of those ""Why didn't I come up with that?"" ideas.

I really like Daniel Craig, but he is not in the movie very long. You get the impression that he might get more on-screen time later in the story, but Lyra is our star. As Lyra, Dakota Blue Richards was everything she needed to be, when she need to be. She was stubborn, sassy, strong, and lots of other things that don't start with the letter S.

I don't like Nicole Kidman. In almost every role she is sneaky, rude, cold and nasty. And that is exactly how she was in The Golden Compass, and I loved it. Mrs. Coulter is each and every one of those things.

The animation for the movie was very well done. There were many parts of the movie where the animators could have made it look less animated, but they didn't. I think it added to the fantasy element of the story to keep it this way.

The story moves pretty quickly. There is a lot of information packed into just one movie. Normally I would gripe about the lack of depth given to certain parts of the plot, but I am making an exception for The Golden Compass under the assumption that things will be explained in the next two installments of the series.

It was PG-13 and the only reason I could see was for animated violence. Many people died, but there was little or no blood.

You can call this a children's movie if you want, but I think it is time we re-evaluated that category. You will like this movie if you like fun fantasy/adventure stories. I loved it.",1196812800,9,2682,4.320079522862823

So much jumping around.

Besides that, the universe is not well constructed, but the cast was decent, at times.
One of the things that really stood out, to me, is that there were a lot of things that could easily point to occult symbolism in this movie.

It's interesting that the primary object of power is something that allows you to know the Truth.
Very peculiar that they call the familiars ""demons"", also.

In fact, at least a few major allies, or important characters, seemed to be either directly, or symbolically, tied to traditionally malevolent archetypes.
The demons, the witches, the bear (or beast), the magistrate (Catholic Church).

There were a lot of big-name actors playing support roles, or roles where they had all of 15 seconds of screen time, or something like that.
Anytime I see a dozen actors doing little-to-nothing in a movie like this, along with suggestive occult symbols, it certainly raises a brow.

I can totally see little kids watching this film, and desiring to have a little pet ""demon"" follow them around everywhere.
The Occult is not something to play around with, and movies like this always make it seem like it's this wonderful, colorful, vibrant secret society of people who just aren't accepted, and ""awwww what a bummer"", but the Truth is that it's very dark and evil stuff that shouldn't be encouraged, or fantasized about, nor folks that you really want to associate with.

Alas, of course, it has not panned out. However, there was something about the many kinds of heroism in this movie that affected me very deeply. For me, this is a classic.

An excellent liar who saves her from many situations, she may someday find her assets are liabilities. A chance visit by her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), will change her life for ever.

Well movies can not be the book and many times for brevity speeches are cut and locations are rearranged (from a 400 page book to a 110 page script.) But you have to draw the line some where. Unfortunately this is one of those times where they left the action in and changed the story form a multifaceted mystery to a black and white good guy vs. bad guy. We may as well have been watching Saturday afternoon cowboys with black and white hats. Some of the facets were skillfully woven into the non-verbal part of the film with the hope that you read the book and know what is happening. Still the focus switched from a coming of age story to free the slaves and what not. And what is with introducing a bad guy from the next installment to an earlier scene at Jordan collage that masking the turmoil of conciseness at the college?

I do agree that the movie needed to stop short of the cliffhanger end of the book. Let us see what happens when Lyra brings her father what he needs.

On the plus side, the costumes and props were excellent. The CGI did not overwhelm the story. Daemons knew their place. The music matched the scenes and did not overwhelm the dialog. They did a great job of choosing the actors. We can hope they will be around for ""The Subtle Knife"" (2009)."" Nicole Kidman made a perfect Mrs. Coulter and the added scene where she slaps her monkey give hope to becoming more complex character. The voice of Iorek Byrnison (name changed) is Ian McKellen of ""The Da Vinci Code"" fame.

Pullman captures the darkness of institutionalized religion or theocracy, and shows us how sacrifice can salvage wrongdoing.  Pullman can write very well.",1504483200,,618,4.63302752293578

Alas, I'm not sure why they didn't continue the franchise?!?",1498867200,,322,4.47457627118644

1596418,1,B00005JPNY,"This movie is based off a complex, story and character driven series of books, that seems to have only been skimmed while writing this film. Often in this film you'll find that any of the gruesome imagery from the book or heavier themes are ignored to achieve it's pg-13 rating. I'm often happy to hear when my favorite stories are being translated to film to see the turns they take with the adaptation, but while many adaptations simply shorten scenes and cut away non essential material, this film often removes crucial scenes and changes material to suit the younger demographic they were shooting to please. I feel it has no real tie to the source material and has wasted the unique opportunity to bring to life Philip Pullman's wonderful Dark Materials.",1496534400,,759,4.801526717557252
1596419,4,B00005JPNY,"Nowhere near as good as the book, so reader/viewer beware. The good is the casting, the wonderful special effects, and most of the dialogue, and cinematography. Love the nobility of certain characters and aspects of the message and morality. The bad, too much exposition, too much jumbled action that is anti-climactic (how is that possible), because it doesn't feel like the writer loved, knew very well, or understood the source material. Still, much as I disliked this in theatres, the flick is better after repeat viewings (but maybe I'm sci-fi/fantasy story starved, so am bumping the rating from a 3-star review to 4 stars).

And I'm no reflexive hater or novel purist--Lord of the Rings are some of the best movies ever made, period. This just wasn't a good movie on its own merits, forget how it butchered the book.

There is zero character development, everything goes by at lightning speed (with zero transitions or continuity, it just feels like a bunch of disjointed scenes) and all of the magic of the book is lost. It's a real shame because Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were probably the best Asriel and Coulter we were ever going to get. Thank goodness they didn't make any more of these.

What is a friend?
How far should friends go to protect one another?
How can a girl fight back against adults?
How can a child know if an adult can be trusted?

1596658,5,B00005JPNY,"An enthralling, extremely imaginative science fiction / Steampunk adventure that takes place in another dimension of Earth, where everything has developed somewhat differently than in our world.

Adapted from the Golden Compass trilogy by Phillip Pullman, the story is intense & multi-layered, with deep, complex characters you quickly come to know & care about. Like all truly great sci-fi, the books & movie are a fascinating mix of sci-fi & social commentary, with a generous helping of Steampunk style thrown in for a vividly imaginative & visually fascinating tale of quest, courage & companionship. If you like Game Of Thrones or Hunger Games, you'll like this because it's even more intricate & fantastic.

The movie is beautifully made, with an all-star A-list cast. Even the special effects are special. It faithfully captures the first book of the trilogy, and while it stands on its own quite well, reading the books is highly recommended..",1476489600,,951,5.209150326797386

1596783,1,B00005JPNY,"This movie is such a grotesque and horrid adaptation of the book. This review will contain spoilers of either the book or the movie, so read at your own risk.

This movie begins wonderfully, setting the stage of the book very well, which got my hopes up! I thought the book had a rather slow start, and was happy to see the movie quickly give all the background information at once, rather than piecing part of information in slowly, as in the books. However, not far off the bat, the movie begins to deviate from the book. Small things, here or there, but they grow bigger and bigger! At first I was going to excuse them as the classic ""Oh, they need to cut corners to manage time. That's fine."" BUT NO! THEY BEGIN TO CUT, CLEAVE, AND MASH seemingly whatever they want, into this monstrosity. I think this movie would have been able to portray the real story much better if they got a better rating to work with, I imagine if this was rated R, they would have been able to keep some of the very important, visceral aspects of the book that made it so gripping. In the movie, Lord Asriel didn't showcase the terrible, decapitated head, or drop mysterious hints about the city of light, the separated child, none of that. Lord Asriel didn't spend time showing his relationship with Lyra, nor did they capture the real interaction of the college with the attempt on his life. They entirely skipped the whole tone of dark subterfuge and treachery of things right off the bat, that were so important in establishing the mood of the book. All of that, just poof- reworked. Fine. I guess I can live with that. Next off, the introduction of Mrs. Coulter! ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! They botched her appearance (Book explicitly states she had DARK BROWN hair, in the movie she's blonde. Why? That serves no purpose! Alright, whatever, it's a small gripe I have with it, as long as she portrays Mrs. Coulter well.) SHE DOESN'T. The entire paradigm with Lyra overhearing key lines from anonymous party goers, before she becomes enchanted with Mrs. Coulter, the female scientist, showing Lyra that women can be free, intelligent, revered, respected, that's gone. In the movie, Coulter immediately advanced upon Lyra, rather than Lyra naturally falling charmed to her massive amounts of charisma that really, really don't get captured here. This really is IMPORTANT for the story, because Lyra's idolization of Coulter leads that much more to the crushing disillusionment when she first decides to contest Coulter's authority. That was an essential part of the book! You find out that this wonderful, too-good-and-kind-and-perfect-to-be-true lady is incredibly insidious! It's a betrayal that shocks Lyra into running away! The real time in the movie also doesn't hold well to the books, as she actually spent more than a couple weeks doing everything Mrs. Coulter dictated, behaving herself perfectly becoming an aristocratic lady, being groomed and showcased at parties that she hates, those didn't get properly done either. So ALL OF THAT has been screwed up at this point, and I'm still holding out for the panserbjorne.

Next up! THE INTRODUCTION OF LORD FAA AND THE GYPTIANS! While the casting for Faa seemed to be decent, the rest of the Gyptians are casted horribly, and the mood and emotions felt with the important meeting- botched. There was an incredible amount of tension on Lyra as she was going to the roping, she had absolutely no idea what was going on, or why, or whether she was in trouble, or safe, or anything! After the terribly imposing figure of Lord Faa turns out to be a respected, kind, though intimidating- NONE OF THAT. So much subtlety which builds in the books is just done away with.

Fine, whatever, the Gyptians are a decent portion, but I really only care about the bears! Because armored polar bears! QUEUE THE INTRODUCTION OF IOREK BYRNISON: Felt a little rushed at first, not bad, not bad, going well, going well, and then THEY BOTCH THAT TOO! They completely screwed his backstory! They COMPLETELY SCREWED HIS BACKSTORY! Not only that, but they do a terrible job describing the circumstances that forced his current predicament! From this point on, the movie got to a point of horrid-ness that I was anxiously checking how much time was left in the movie so I could FINALLY BE RID OF THIS ABOMINATION. I already knew that they destroyed the overall appearance of the bear armors, they CHANGED IOFUR RAKNISON's NAME TO RAGNAR, for some reason, and abolished, and re-ordered pretty much the rest of the book from this point.

I will say the ONE GOOD THING of this adaptation, is that they were able to show the one crucial part when Iorek fights RAGNAR, and he takes off Ragnars jaw. THAT was good. Could have been done better, but with this PG-13 bulls***, I was expecting some other attempt to gloss that over, too.

I've rambled on for so long, and I still haven't even covered all the problems I have with this, but I bet you got the picture when you saw what a block of text I wrote. Yes, I'm a bit emotional writing this review, but understand that I had just finished the book when I watched this, and while I knew the book would be better, I had NOT EXPECTED A TRAGEDY SUCH AS THIS! Please, please, don't bother with this. It actually became painful to watch. Stick to the book.",1463356800,3,5305,4.718446601941747

The Golden Compass is really just a setup for the next 2 books but they never made the follow up movies.

1596834,3,B00005JPNY,"I LOVE the book, but the movie really sucks. But it's not quite the fault of the filmmaker. The movie was neutered by the producers who wanted to tame the story and not make it as controversial. The cut the ending and changed a TON of the movie AFTER it was shot. However bits of the original storyboard (And even bits of the cut movie) can be found online and in the tie-in game. There is a YouTube video that pieces together that audio and storyboards to show how it was really supposed to end. But that's the only redeeming factor.

Thank god it's being remade as a TV show!",1457395200,,577,4.245454545454545
1596885,1,B00005JPNY,"How can one fault a movie which provided employment for hundreds of CGI technicians? Quite easily, when it is also a monument of ineptitude. This wannabe fantasy features subtitled Tartar speech, along with animals speaking the Queen's English. This leads to a disgusting sequence of Bear Lust, in which the 12-year-old actress D. B. Richards attempts to seduce the ursine lead. Combining child molestation with bestiality? Wonderful. Richards described this scenario as ""very stupid"". Pullman's weak story line is swamped by a 2-1/2 hour credit/features segment (including 44 named drivers!), and the writer/director's commentary is barely literate: ""revelant"" and ""graffitis"", for instance. Why give the movie any stars at all? Only for the two minutes allotted professional actors Christopher Lee and Derek Jacobi.",1457049600,2,817,5.650406504065041

The preview seemed good, but I stopped watching it half way through because they kept referring to the people's souls as 'demons' and that really weirded me out.  And they kept referring to them as demons over and over again, which made me feel like they were trying to infuse this weird subliminal messaging.  Yes, that might sound crazy and maybe even a little ""conspiracy theorist,"" but why make a conscious decision to use the word, ;demon' anyway?  What's the benefit?  The story line didn't need it at all....just weird.  For that reason, 1 star.",1446940800,2,634,4.718181818181818

1597073,1,B00005JPNY,"At about 00:19:00 there is a VERY LOUD POP in all surround sound speakers. I TRIED TWO COPIES with exactly the same results. The first time it was so loud it scared us to jump out of our theater seats AND SHUT DOWN the entire theater system. Fortunately, no very expensive damage occured (which we feared) to essentially irreplaceable custom speaker systems. The second and third tests (with another blu-ray copy) were played through with very low volume.
  --->>Amazon told me they would pull this blu-ray disk from sales, but I see that has not happened...yet.
SPOILER FOLLOWS?? As for the movie...Nice movie, EXCEPT NO ENDING and it never follows through with Lord Asriel's mission to travel to the alternate universe, WHICH IS WHAT THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT!! Danial Craig (Lord Asriel) ONLY APPEARS FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES and then he disappears and we focus on bears fighting in the Arctic. Huh? Important message (if you get it) LOST!! VERY disapointing. The screen goes black and the credits roll for a VERY ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot !!"" moment!! In the extras, the director quit saying he was afraid he couldn't make this movie.

1597590,5,B00005JPNY,"A remarkable, beautiful and thought provoking story with wonderful characters and acting. I really don't get the 3 & 1/2 star rating... Although certainly it's not for everyone. If you enjoy looking at a different 'reality' well thought out and beautifully portrayed,  and appreciate the questioning of  socially and religiously conditioned thought and behavior I think you will enjoy it. I own this movie (and I own less than 10, what with Amazon, Netflix, etc.) and have probably seen it 5 times, and I see VERY few movies more than once. The only others I can think of are ""The Matrix Trilogy"", ""Jesus Christ Super Star"" (both versions), ""Lars and the Real Girl"" and ""I <3 Huckabees"". That'll give you a little frame of reference re: my taste. This is the first review I've ever posted. I was motivated by what I perceived as a travesty of misguidance with the star rating. I read the book after seeing the movie a couple times and enjoyed both equally. The book is very complex and of course it can't all fit into a movie, but they did a splendid job with the time available. I consider it a minor tragedy that religious disapproval apparently kept the other two parts of the trilogy from being made into movies... When many other 'fantasies' get mindlessly stretched out into multiple films w/ gratuitous and over long battle scenes. Good stories, but still...
In any case if you enjoy intelligent fantasy I suspect you'll find this movie satisfying and maybe it will even work in you for days, and cause you to want to see it again, and show it to your like minded friends, as it did me.",1423267200,,1593,4.625441696113074

1597592,5,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass did not enjoy very good critical reviews, but as a fan of fantasy and science fiction films, I disagree. The cast, the acting, the script and the special effects are all very good, and the story is hardly run-of-mill. Of additional interest (see Wikipedia) was the controversy over the degree to which the film reflected an anti-church bias on the part of the author of the novel the film is based on. On that count, the film was attacked both by secularists for toning down the bias, and Catholic Church groups complaining that the bias was all too evident.",1421452800,,577,4.666666666666667
1597593,4,B00005JPNY,"In my youth, seemingly many decades ago, I was a voracious reader of all things fantasy and no doubt I would have thoroughly enjoyed Philip Pullman's acclaimed trilogy. Unfortunately I'd rediscovered science fiction by the time these novels were published so I've never got around to reading them. I can therefore only review this film as a movie rather than an adaptation of a familiar novel. This is probably a good thing as a fanatical obsession with the original text certainly spoilt my first couple of viewings of The Lord of the Rings and of the Harry Potter films.

Squeezing a big, complex, heavily sub-plotted novel in to a couple of hours is never easy and it will never be possible to please all of the people all of the time. From my perspective as an outsider, this film is mostly excellent. The cast is a who's-who of acting talent and although the kids' fake cockney accents are a little Mary Poppins they're not too annoying. The plot is taut, the narrative piles along at a cracking pace and the CGI is superb, particularly of the bears and the daemons. There is obviously a lot missing and a greater explanation of the prophecies and the role of the witches would have rounded things off nicely, but the ending is a calamity, leaving loose ends flapping about all over the place.

It is obvious that further adaptations of the next two books were planned and the filmmakers could not have predicted the vehement outpouring of religious intolerance and bigotry which forced the studio to pressure the director into making some `difficult' editing decisions. With a tidy ending, this stand-alone film would have stood out as a fantasy classic, sitting comfortably alongside LotR and the HP's. If the loony religious right had kept their interfering Magisterial noses out of it, the trilogy would probably have been brilliant but hey, it's all about control & power over the masses.",1421452800,,1898,4.819018404907975

1597928,2,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass

  THE GOOD:  I love battling polar bears, much less polar bears in armor.  The staging of this film is truly first class.  The makers have created a mock Victorian setting with great detail and lavish, eyeball delighting grandeur.  Clearly, vast amounts of talent and cash were lavished in making this movie.
 They have assembled a world famous cast, except for the plucky little newbie, Dakota Blue Richards in the juvenile leading role.  Sam Elliott, Eva Green, and Daniel Craig are all terrific actors.  It is always pleasurable to see any of them work.  Nicole Kidman carries the adult lead, doing the best she can with the script.
 THE BAD:  Director Chris Weitz also wrote the screen play for this movie.  It is incomprehensible.  Characters appear from thin air, just in time to further the plot.  And disappear as well.  Poor Daniel Craig is left out in the snow for very little reason, awaiting the sequel.
 THE CONTROVERSY:  British atheist Philip Pullman wrote 'His Dark Materials', a trilogy fantasy of an alternate world. The original works are reported to be ferociously anti-Catholic in particular and anti-Christian in general.  The 'toned down' version in the movie is less so.  You be the judge.
 Each human has a soul, but outside the body and with a real physical presence.  The soul is called a Demon. The overarching evil presence, the Magisteriam, is a transparent depiction of the Catholic Church.  The Magisteriam kidnaps little kids, imprisons them and in a series of experiments, tries to destroy the kid's souls.  The kids die in the process, as the experimental severing of the soul is unperfected.
 THE SHAME:  A large group of Hollywood people invested a huge amount of time, talent and $180,000,000 to make this movie.  They hoped it would be a huge success and be followed by two more to round out the trilogy.  No one seemed to think that making a movie where priests and nuns are diabolically evil and witches are good, and releasing it during Christmas season would not be a good idea. What were they thinking?
 The polar bears and the sets are the only reason this film gets even a paltry two saw blades.",1412726400,,2161,4.793478260869565

The theme of free will is thrown in at the end to justify how really evil Nichole Kidman's Nazi Mengele -like character was. Technically good pieces of film, great acting and intriguing propositions, just not put together or going anywhere. It is amusing to read rumors of Christians putting pressure against a sequel.

Also, I am certainly not a ""purist"" when it comes to book to movie adaptations, I completely understand that things need to be changed in order to make sense on screen, so that is not the problem at all.  The acting was mediocre at best, no one who hadn't read the books could understand it, and it was pretty boring.  Considering the amount of talent in the movie I was actually surprised how bad it was.  The books are way better and make a lot more sense, so save yourself two hours of tedium watching this and read them instead, because they are really well done and unique.

1598590,2,B00005JPNY,"My (now 8-year-old) daughter and I read The Golden Compass and finished it the same night we watched this on Amazon.  We were both disappointed, her especially.

For those who've read the book, as to be expected there were many shortcuts, twists of the story to suit something faster-paced and characters conflated or just not given adequate attention to feel like you knew what their personality or motives were.

But beyond this, the movie just seemed like a rush to get through as many scenes from the book that they could manage, without really much of any character development.  IE, all plot and little character.  I feel like I have to go back and re-watch it because I'm sure I missed a lot because it was so rushed.

The movie did do a great job visualizing everything in the book.  For the most part, everything was more or less how I had imagined this world to be.  Unfortunately, because of the pacing, one didn't get a great chance to really admire all that scenery, because it just went by too quickly.

Due to that speed, I would guess that those who hadn't read the book would by and large be somewhat confused about the point of all this.  To them it probably seems like just a crazy fantasy adventure with animal spirits and odd steampunkish devices and vehicles.

**Spoiler alert: I'll try to details some of the things I missed from the book that would have made a difference, so if you don't want to know about some of the details of the movie/book, you might want to stop reading.**

There was almost no talk of the aurora or the city in the sky, something central to the book.  They do mention mention dust once or twice, but it's mostly Lyra suddenly figuring out what dust is on her own.  The only time there's discussion of it by an adult I think is in the initial scene with Lord Asriel at Jordan.

Lyra's character was plucky but had very little range.  There are numerous times in the book where she cried quite a bit.  I guess crying in the movie would have meant either too much time, or somehow would have shown her not to be ""strong.""  You got a tiny glimpse of how Lyra could lie/spin a yarn, but just barely.

Lord Asriel was in the movie for all of two minutes probably.

There was a scene in the movie that was not in the book that made zero sense - Mrs. Coulter slapping her daemon, then comforting it.  We haven't read the other two books in Pullman's series, so maybe this presages something in one of those?  But I kind of doubt it.  The only thing I can think is that either Mrs. Coulter has been separated from her daemon or she is a masochist, because you are supposed to feel everything your daemon feels - something the movie actually shows well for other characters.

In general, the movie leaves out the more disturbing scenes, possibly because they thought they were too dark for a younger audience?  For example, while they do show the scene where Lyra discovers the child who's daemon has been separated from him (albeit it's a different character from the one in the book), at the end the import of this is spoiled because a) the child does not die, and b) his mother, comforting him, acts as if it's like he's lost a pet which she promises to find for him.  There is none of the shock of this, only a few signs that this might be more serious than losing a pet.  That's another omission here, although they mention at the very beginning that the animal daemon is part of the person's soul, they don't reinforce this with any other statement throughout the book.  About the only other indication is when a daemon (I think it's mainly just Pantalaiman) is attacked once or twice and it's human seems to feel it's pain.  So the whole idea of ""severing"" doesn't have nearly the import it does in the book.  I can imagine those who haven't read the book scratching their heads as to that whole idea, and just not getting that it was about the worst thing imaginable - even worse than death - for most people of this world.

The movie didn't even include the final scene of the book - the opening of the bridge to the other world.

Again, it was really disappointing from an adaptation point of view.  It was interesting to see the visualizations, but ultimately frustrating due to the limitations of film.  Peter Jackson made The Hobbit, a book much shorter than The Golden Compass, into a three-part movie.  If this movie had been given that degree of attention and breathing room, it could have really been much better, even great.

It all comes down to money I guess.  Authors and publishers want to make money selling the film rights, and movie studios want to translate that investment into ticket sales and DVD rentals (or whatever the equivalent is for streaming) as quickly as possible.  It does take someone with deep pockets, vision, stubbornness and perhaps just their own movie studio, to pay adequate homage to a longer book that is relatively complex.  It's seldom done, and so we end up with very mediocre stuff like this film, which is ok for a family movie night, but probably never watched afterwards.  It pales so much in comparison to the book.  If you are watching this with your kids, I would highly recommend reading the book to them or have them read it, because it has so much more depth than this mere shell of a movie...",1384646400,,5295,4.479666319082377

(Another company got overseas rights and did OK, because they didn't screw up the marketing.) Anyway, I love the film, the performances, the effects.

Angry, because I know that since it didn't make any money, there won't be any more sequels to finish up the book series.  And also angry, because bowing to pressure from religious organizations, a lot of the book got cut out of this movie.  With said religious organizations probably being another reason the sequels were not made.

Based off the of the book series, The Golden Compass covers most of the first book in the series by Philip Pullman.  Lyra, a young girl who is a ward of Jordan College has a pretty carefree life.  She studies, runs around with other young kids, and has fun with her Daemon.  Oh yeah, Daemons, this is an alternate universe, where every human being is accompanied by an animal spirit.  One that can change shapes until the human matures.  But everything isn't fine in Lyra's world.  Children have gone missing and the only thing they hear is about the mysterious Gobblers who take them.

This film has a heck of a cast.  Almost all of them are very well known.  But you know, Richard as Lyra outacted all of them.  She was great and had the right amount of arrogance and pride and bravery to really play Lyra to full effect.  I can't say I'd pictured Lyra any differently.  Kidman put in a solid role as Mrs. Coulter too.  Like sweet poison, she manages to be both abusive and loving at the same time.  Craig was barely in the movie, so I can't comment on him too much at all.  McKellan and Bates also played smaller roles.  And Pan, with his voice actor of Highmore, wasn't what I expected.  I realize they wanted to use a younger voice for him to make him the same age as Lyra, but I just didn't think the voice fit.

This film didn't follow the book entirely.  There were a lot of differences, such as the order of some of the scenes, the demphasis on the Magisterium, and the ending.  And some of the background that let you know who these characters were was left out.  The pace was also rushed a bit more.  There was a lot of controversy surrounding this movie (and the book admittedly) because of its approach to religion.  However, the movie was much more mild than the book is and it shows.  All that controversy and ideas that make the book an eye-opener are noticeably missing in this movie.  And that's because it had a lot of opposition even before it came out.  Which I don't understand.  If you don't agree with it, why watch it?  It would be like me watching ""Prince of Egypt"" and hating it because of its thoughts on religion and demanding that it not be made rather than not watching it, or if having watched it, weighing it on its filmography, storyline and script (I actually did enjoy Prince of Egypt by the way).

And you can't really deny that the special effects and animation in The Golden Compass are well done.  The way they show the Daemons, the colors, the Ice Bears, the witches.  Just everything is animated quite well.  It looks realistic but still magical at the same time.  And even the violence was a bit surreal.  There is an Ice Bear fight that can get kind of graphic, but it was a smaller part of the film as a whole.  The music in the film was, like most, instrumental, and was neither distracting or fantastic.  It was just there in the background where it didn't effect much.

It's sad to know that we won't be seeing more of this series on film, at least not with the same actors (as they will have aged out).  It was very nice visually even if the script didn't give the full satisfaction of the book.

1598745,5,B00005JPNY,"had this on my to do list and what a great movie... only problem now is I want to see part two, etc and I know that they will not kae any more... wish Hollywood would not make movies that do not finish without committing to the pother parts just to finish the story and not worry about making gobs of profit...",1377820800,,310,4.016129032258065

1598747,1,B00005JPNY,"I wasted my money getting this movie.  A fantasy movie starring Nicole Kidmand,  Daniel Craig - how can it be boring?  But it is!!  Yes, visual effects are stunning and the movie LOOKS interesting.  But in the middle of the movie, I turned it off.  It is bad enough that I wasted money on this loser.  I was not going to waste my time any further!!

Why is this movie so bad?  It is because there is no way anyone can relate to characters in this movie.  It is set in an alternative universe and all characters in this movie  act in very non sensical fashion.  I mean, what is the big deal with the shoulder bag??  And who the hell cares about these good looking but odd characters??  How can anyone relate to what they are thinking or what they are trying to do?

Oh I see.  I guess I should have paid more attention to little critters who really represent their inner thoughts and intention.  Is that the key?

Actually the real key is that the author, screen writer,  and the movie producer may have little gerbils running around in their heads.  I have no other explanation for this awful movie.",1376092800,4,1099,4.320197044334975

1598812,4,B00005JPNY,"I read the 3 books about 3 years ago. I was not a kid then. I was 66. I found it exciting, mind-bending, deep. The characters were multi-dimensional. The plot was gut-wrenching. The movie added some solidity to the imaginings of that first read. The characters are of necessity somewhat sketchier, but still believable. The special effects are outstanding. After this movie (and 10 minutes of credits) you will want the sequels. I can hope.",1371427200,,440,4.88

1598814,5,B00005JPNY,Golden Compass is a classic story made into an excellent movie.  Great actors make the story enjoyable to watch. Although I can understand the difficulty it is too bad the other books in the series could not be adapted for a movie presentation.,1371168000,,244,4.674418604651163
1598815,5,B00005JPNY,We rented the Golden Compass as my child was reading the series. It was actually a great movie! I was pleased to see some action and some well told storylines in the same film. Well done.,1370908800,,187,4.222222222222222

1598817,3,B00005JPNY,"This was my favorite book as a kid. I haven't read it in at least 15 years (probably more), but it affected me so deeply that as I watched the movie I found myself being able to quote out lines from the book. That said, I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that it would be a different thing than the book and being okay with that. And I must say, I enjoyed it pretty much all the way through. It didn't capture what was so incredible and moving about the book, of course, but it was still an enjoyable fantasy ride.

HOWEVER, if you have read the book, prepare to be in for a shock at the end. I guess I shouldn't give it away, but it ends very differently from the book. To the point where I yelled in disgust at my screen. I was prepared to treat the movie as a different entity from the book, but I wasn't quite prepared for that. Lovers of the book, beware. You can enjoy this movie, but only if you divorce it completely from what moved you about the book and take it for what it is - an enjoyable, fairly fluffy fantasy movie.",1370649600,5,1045,4.048309178743962

Also, it isn't attacking christianity... especially in this movie. There is hardly any mention of the ""Church"" which is called the ""Magesterium"" in this series. Only if they had been allowed to make the second or third movie, you might have had to worry about that.",1369785600,,446,4.575

1598917,4,B00005JPNY,"Not sure how faithful was this adaptation from the books, but the movie stands pretty well by itself. Fun and interesting concept. A downside is that they left it open for future movies, which I heard is not happening anymore. Will have to read the books.

In my opinion, it also had a ""steampunk""-ish feel to it. Anyone who loves this, or alternate universes premises, shape shifting (animals), etc, will most likely enjoy this film.",1363737600,,434,4.786666666666667

1599072,2,B00005JPNY,"This movie is visually beautiful and extremely well-cast. Those are the reasons for the two stars.

Now for the reasons for the missing three.

It's not unusual at all for a movie to leave out parts of the book on which it was based. It's not unusual for multiple characters to be composited into a single character. This movie, however, left out an additional - and very important component - the point.

Book Spoiler - Don't worry if you're only going to watch the movie. It's not in there anyway.

Throughout the movie we're told that the Gobblers are doing something dastardly to children, but we're NEVER told what. Oh yeah. They're ripping away their SOULS! And children die. From having their SOULS ripped away. Bet you didn't know that if you haven't read the book. And the ending? ""We're going to find Father and everything will be alright."" Excuse me. What???? You're kidding, right?

Try telling the story of Red Riding Hood without the ""Wolf eats Granny"" part. Forget this movie. Read the book -- but not to your kids.",1359849600,,1030,4.668508287292818

1599150,3,B00005JPNY,"I'll start of by saying that I am extremely pleased with some movie adaptations of books I've really enjoyed.  I'll cite Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings as some.  While there are some variations in Harry Potter I take issue with, for the most part, they are true to the original purpose.

Now I'll say I know exactly why The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass were never adapted.  It's the same reason the Narnia series was cancelled after The Dawn Treader - poor casting, poor acting, and a serious deviation from a beloved storyline.  When directors and scriptwriters' heads get too big for them, the movie goes down the tubes.  The reason a book is adapted is because people love it!  Don't change it so much it becomes a story loosely based on a book!

This movie skews so far in some ways.  First off, the casting.  Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman DO NOT fit the descriptions given for Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter.  Their looks, their personalities, etc. are just not right.  Then there are a lot of small things that add up to a jumbled tale - the Master is supposed to poison the wine. Fra Pavel was an aleithiometer reader, not the antagonist.  Lyra knows Roger has been taken by the Gobblers before she leaves Jordan college and is already set on rescuing him.  Then, she escapes at a party unnoticed, she never find the golden monkey in her room and darts out the window.  Plus, the Gyptians weren't looking for and over Lyra once she left Jordan, Lyra meets Lord Faa and Farder Coram in the Fens, not on a big ships.  Gyptians travel by longboats in canals and waterways.  And there are lots of people who know things they aren't supposed to know.  It all moves very quickly.  I understand it's a movie and has to move quickly, but you lose so much of the feel of Lyra's Oxford this way.  Plus we miss a very large part of the background of Lyra, her parents, and the part of the Gyptians, which I believe is an important part of the story.  As is her time in the Fens, another interesting area I would have liked to have seen in the film.

Then the Gyptians are off to get the Gobblers in no time, and then they show Mrs. Coulter in league with Fra Pavel, and Serafina Pekkala shows up on the deck of the ship instead of her daemon Kaisa, as it should have been.  All wrong.  Lyra doesn't meet Serafina until she's flying with Lee Scoresby.  Nor does she pose such a dumb question for Lyra to ask the aleithiometer.  Also, she should know that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are her parents at this point, thanks to Ma Costa.  And Billy Costa NEVER experiences intercision, it's a kid named Tony Makarios Lyra and Iorek find in the fish hut in the village.  Lyra's being taken to Svalbard, Iorek's ascension to king, and the progression to Bolvangar take place out of sequence and not as they happened in the book as well.  Lyra should free the daemons at Bolvangar, aided by Kaisa, and when she goes to Lord Asriel, she should be with a contingent of armored bears, not in the balloon.  And we never see the cliff ghasts or really learn anything about the armoured bears.

What it boils down to is this: all the elements that Philip Pullman worked so hard to integrate into his story, to make Lyra's world such a rich, full, complex, and unique one are watered down.  We don't get the feel for her world.  And we know it's possible - I cite the Harry Potter series, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  They got the mood, complexities, feelings, and characters *just* right.  You can feel you're a part of a vibrant world in those movies.  This feels washed out and watered down, like we're just skimming the surface instead of being immersed in it.

Even worse?  The movie ends before the book does.  And that's it.  1 hour and 43 minutes.  Not enough time to get the right story or the true feeling of the book.  Lyra's character has no real depth.  She's just a kid darting from one thing to the next.  Her true mind and drive don't come through clearly in the movie.

It's a shame the movie turned out so poorly, as this is one of my favorite trilogies.  Its casting shows a hope for better  things.  Despite their being wrong for the parts, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig are no small-time actors.  Add to that the voice of Ian McKellan, Sam Elliott, the voice of Freddie Highmore, and Derek Jacobi, and you would think it would be a better movie.  Jim Carter has since made a name for himself in Downton Abbey as well.  All name and no oomph.

I'm so disappointed in this movie, and that they were cut off so quickly.  I hope a better screenwriter and director take them up again someday.",1357516800,,4612,4.390070921985815

1599237,3,B00005JPNY,"It's good. Even very good. But with the huge build-up it was given, I have to say it is not great. Perhaps if I was under 18, it would be great. Comes close. But then I read the book first. I kept wondering how it would be if I had seen the film first, and then read the book. I think the movie would indeed stimulate me to read the book.

Dakota Blue Richards is a charming young girl who plays Lyra Belacqua in a world similar to, but not quite the same, as our own.  The movie does stick close to the plot line of the book, although as always, things have to change to accommodate the different medium.

As everyone knows by now, Nicole Kidman plays Mrs. Coulter, who seems ever so beautiful and sweet and fake. She's mysterious in that she says all these nice things about the Magisterium, while the rest of us can tell early on that they are a bunch of power-mad pompous asses. It's clear they represent the Established Church in this world.

This world is different from ours in several ways, but the most significant one is that people's souls are not inside them, but outside in the form of animals. They are called daemons. A child's daemon changes shape pretty much at will, but an adult's settles into a single form. You can tell a lot about a person by the nature of their daemon. Mrs. Coulter's is a nasty-tempered golden monkey. Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), who starts the movie by making it clear that the Magisterium and he hate each other, has a leopard. The other thing you should know is that, with rare exceptions, the daemon is of the opposite gender from the human.

Think about that one for awhile. Carl Jung would understand.

It's all very confusing, but I suspect twice as confusing if you've never read the book. The special effects are quite believable, and add a visual dimension to what I read. The spy flies are especially interesting; keep your eye on them.

I enjoyed it, but I'm not as crazy about the movie as I was of the book. For one thing, Kidman over-plays the pink and black witch role; sweet candy coating over something really nasty. Also, her hair-do in her first scene is ridiculous.",1336953600,2,2127,4.42455242966752

I didn't like that everyone had their own demon. That was a major turn off. I just never got drawn into the plot or the characters. Not sure why. This type of movie usually speaks to me.

1599324,2,B00005JPNY,"Generally an undeniably visually stunning film, sumptuous in appearance, but look a little closer and the CGI is just too obvious - the film almost feels like a cartoon in that respect. Worse still, the film is killed by an unseemly rush to get from the first page of the book to the last. The story is compressed to the point of ridiculousness and, much as the fans of the book would have hated a more ruthless abridgement, it would have been better to have lost /sections/ of the story rather than to try to cram them all into a 2 hour playing time as the director, scriptwriter and editor have done here. It really makes a travesty of an epic, rich and detailed story. Contrast this with Peter Jackson's seamless treatment of the even more immense LotR trilogy.

The acting is barely acceptable, despite the all star cast - no-one really seems to care about their characters. Disappointing, really - Ian McKellen is just a big teddy bear, Jim Carter is capable of far better, Sam Elliot is... well, Sam Elliot again, really, and Dan Craig should probably stick to his Bond character (d'you see what I did there? Stick to... Bond. I crack myself up. Really I do.)

When played through the sound system of my TV (only a 4-year old Toshiba), the sound was full of static at numerous points in the film.  Every adjustment I could think of to work around the problem failed.  The 5.1 channel extras disc played just fine.  The static ruined what could have been an enjoyable movie.  So unless your TV and sound system is really current, you could wind up with a bad sound experience too.  I have no complaints at all about the video presentation of the film.  The visual experience was terrific.

I recently discovered that the ""driver"" for my then-new DVD player was not updated.  Who knew that you had to update a DVD player right out of the box like a computer.  I surely didn't.

1599392,3,B00005JPNY,"When Harry Potter came out I ran across an internet article that described a number of children's films as more or less Harry Potter wannabes that failed to capture audience share.  The comments posted on the article suggested that a number of readers felt this was a harsh assessment, so I decided to view some of these films and read the books upon which they were based. The Golden Compass was one of those cited.

The story is hardly a Harry Potter wannabe, though it probably owes a lot to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Movie-Tie-in-Edition-Narnia/dp/0060765488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Movie Tie-in Edition (Narnia)</a>.  While it deals with the same issues facing young people--friendship, courage, loss, development of an identity--these are all things that are part of the genre and not specific to Harry Potter.  Almost all literature is based to some degree on predecessors.  There is probably only one children's book I can think of that seems truely divorced from all other formats and that is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/1612930301/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>, though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-the-Looking-Glass-Complete-and-Unabridged/dp/1450515932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through the Looking Glass: Complete and Unabridged</a>&nbsp;might be said to have given even that a ""copycat.""

The story of The Golden Compass essentially describes what actually happens to children in society at large.  Schooling, society's priorities and stern discipline of infractions do indeed mold people to ""fit,"" whether they want to or not.  In essence children's spirits, or here their ""demons,"" are forced to conform or be lost.  The question isn't whether or not they are, but to whose agenda they are ultimately molded, and that is determined by a society almost always dominated by adults.  It comes as no surpise that it is the child's own mother who is among the forces suppressing other children and their families while protecting her own daughter and her demon from similar forces.

The universal ""correctness"" of society is what the young always question, and it is usually the young and spirited that force society itself to change by degree over time.  It is for this reason that life now is so different from life in ones grandparent's generation.  The difference is easier to see when looking back three generations.  It is hardly surprising then that it is children that are perceived as ""dangerous"" by the adult powers in this story.  Adults have a heavy investment in the status quo; any changes can work to their distinct disadvantage and to that of their children.  At base, the Golden Compass might be seen as an unbiased guide to how society is ""supposed to be,"" which is why the adults want to suppress it and why only a child can ""read"" it.

Although I have yet to read the book, I did watch the film.  I was a little disappointed in it.  While it certainly deals with the issues facing children, it seemed to lack charm.  I couldn't help wonder if the problem was less the children and more the adults.  A number of high profile actors played adult roles and did so superbly.  However, the quality of their acting ended up overwhelming the child roles, creating a sense that the story was more about adults and less about children and the ""magic"" of youth.  This is an odd way to convey philosophical information to adults, most of whom know it already and a disappointing way of presenting it to children.  (For myself I worried less about either and more about the animal ""demons"".)  Somehow it just didn't come together well.

Perhaps the problem is that the actual goal of the film--which was probably about making money and not about messages at all--even perhaps of the book on which it was founded, was indeterminate.  Was the story about adults who feared change?  Or was it about the spirit of children and the necessity, even imperative, of change.  Maybe it was simply left to the audience to decide for themselves: sacrifice security and tradition and endure rigidity and loss of creativity, or endure anarchy and shifting fortune for the privilege of creativity and change.  In the end the film seemed ambivalent.  History tells us that time is not.  (Evolution tells us that it cannot afford to be.)

The film is a nice blend of CGI characters and live action (though I couldn't help feel that the whole metaphor of the ""spirit"" of youth captured in ""demon"" animals was a little heavy handed).  I enjoyed all of the animals immensely.  The genre has come a long way since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit-Vista-Series/dp/B00007AJGH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Vista Series)</a>!  The sets and costumes were beautiful and evocative of the 1930s and that quintessential of all ridged and totalitarian regimes, the Nazis of the same period.  It was precisely this that made the decision for the viewer that change and creativity must be more valuable than stability.

The children actors aren't too bad to watch, Kidman is very good, the various plot elements were intriguing and the effects were of good standard. This had a great cast of both on screen actors, as well as voice over actors and the costumes and sets were pretty impressive. I enjoyed the film most of the way through until I reached the ending which left so much unresolved and set itself up for a sequel. It was SO frustrating to end a film like this that it coloured my overall feelings towards the entire film. I like trilogy type films and those that spread a story over many sequels, but I also like each separate film to be resolved enough to leave you feeling satisfied with two hours viewing and intrigued to find out what will happen next. This left me with none of that. It is a shame that what seemed to be a good film, with a good premise and well directed and acted, shot itself in the foot in such a way. This is worth a viewing if you like fantasy adventure films, but just be aware that you'll have to expect a sequel to resolve the story.

The way that the demons changed form was beautiful.

The main thing I really disliked was the way Lyra ""read"" the compass. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie, but I don't see any reason why they couldn't have followed the book more accurately to portray how she learned to read the compass. As is usually the case when long books are turned into movies, I think that the reason the movie wasn't that good was that it was event, event, event, without much character development. There just isn't enough time for a movie to develop characters well when a book is so long. So I guess I shouldn't have expected too much.",1294012800,2,1060,4.492227979274611

The movie was very enjoyable to watch, but at the same time much of the original story was removed, certain scenes where cut out or rearranged making it a whole lot different from the book which often happens. It's also disappointing due to the fact that there will most likely not be movies on the Subtle Knife, and the Amber Spyglass.

I liked the story, but I did get a bit confused.  I think I will need to read the books.  But regardless, I was really looking forward to watching the rest of the series.  I figured I was late in watching this movie, but I'm sure I was on time for the next ones.
Boy was I surprised to find out that there were not going to be any sequels!  Way worse movies have had sequels made!  And in my opinion I did not think the first movie in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" was better.  So it must be those religious zealots thinking they know what is right for the world.  Ironically in doing so, these Christians proved the author Pullman's point.
By the way, a lot of 1-star reviews I read on Amazon are due to the atheistic stance of the author.  Seems like a lot of them have not even seen the movie, which I thought protrayed evil much the same way Harry Potter movies do.  Another point for Pullman...

It is both wonderful to look at but difficult to follow.  There are moments of sheer magic- like the talking animals, and moments of utter confusion- which are many.
The fantasy is a stunning visual collaboration and I love the concept of animal alter-egos, but I was bothered by the uneven story and distracting production oddities like the bobby pins in Ms. Kidman's hair and her bloodshot eyes. (Had no one on set ever heard of Visine?)

Personally, I was disappointed as I didn't see any point to it and it seemed too open-ended, I guess for a sequel.  I have not read the book, but have noted reviews that say it is a polical allegory.  I'll have to take their word on that.

The brightest spots in her life are the occasional visits of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a noted explorer, whose life she saves when the college's senior faculty set him up to be poisoned.  She hopes that this action will inspire him to take her along on his next expedition, but this he refuses to do.  Sullen and disappointed, she's easy prey for the glamorous Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who invites her to become a sort of apprentice and assistant but turns out to have an agenda of her own, which includes acquiring the alethiometer (the ""golden compass"" of the title) that Lyra has inexplixcably been given by one of the professors.  Delivered from sinister kidnappers by a band of ""gyptians"" (apparently her world's analogue of gypsies), Lyra finds herself going north after all, and turning out to be an indispensable linchpin in the search for many missing children (gyptian and otherwise), with allies who are an odd assortment of human (Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, an aeronaut whose natal Texas seems to have retained her independence in this reality), sentient animal (Ian McKellan as Iorek Byrnison, the exiled heir to the kingship of the giant ice-bears), and possibly slightly miraculous (Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, a leader of the airborne, bow-wielding witches).

Based on the novel by Philip Pullman (the first of a trilogy), ""The Golden Compass"" takes us to a parallel universe where humans mind-meld with shape-shifting creatures known as daemons, children are kidnapped and ""re-programmed"" to live without those daemons, and society is ruled by a mysterious, all-powerful Magisterium that tells people what they are to think and how they are to live.  Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a feisty young orphan whose uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is hot on the trail of a scientific discovery regarding the nature of the universe - a discovery that, if proven true, could completely upend the paradigm that allows the Magisterium to remain in power.  Naturally, Lyra is one of only a handful of very special people who possess the gift of unlocking the mystery of a golden compass said to hold the key to something or other of great importance (in all honesty, this type of mystical mumbo-jumbo is not exactly my cup of tea).  British and American acting stalwarts Ian McKellen, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Nicole Kidman round out the cast.

Much has been made of the supposed anti-religion/pro-science slant in the story (""magisterium"" is the term for the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church), and, indeed, Pullman, a renowned Freethinker, has admitted that he wrote his trilogy of fantasy novels (called, collectively, ""His Dark Materials"") partly as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis' ""Narnia"" series - though the Magisterium doesn`t seem to be any more objectionable as a literary device than the societal super-structures we find in ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"" or ""Fahrenheit 451,"" or countless other such tales (though I gather that the movie somewhat dilutes this aspect of the original story anyway).

If truth be told, I really don`t have much use for films of this genre, but I will say that I find the movie version of ""The Golden Compass"" to be a bit more imaginative and a trifle less plodding than the recent cinematization of ""Chronicles of Narnia.""  Plus, ""Compass"" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet.  But, when all is said and done, it's still just the same old mishmash of talking animals, mythological creatures, precocious youngsters, fantasy battle sequences and over-worked allegory we`ve encountered oh so many times before.

1599611,1,B00005JPNY,"OK, for starters, automatic one star off for any movie with CGI talking animals. I've always believed that the ability to make animal's lips move does not preclude the need for good storytelling. And this movie has attention-deficit storytelling. This thing jumps all over the place. Since this film is aimed squarely at youth, it leaves little question as to the origin of ""Attention Deficit Disorder"" in kids. But then, the drug companies makes millions selling a drug to pill-craving Americans to ""cure"" it, so everyone is happy, but that's another story. Every third scene in this film pauses to lay additional foundation ahead of the film before they have even solidly established where they currently are in the story. A movie that has to constantly explain itself as it goes along is a big tip-off that it doesn't know what it wants to be, or is trying to be too much but doesn't have a clue to how to manage it in two hours. By the one hour mark there was no promise that the movie could redeem itself; it was just going to continue going down the same tired path. So with fifty minutes left, I decided to cut my losses and turn it off. I very seldom do that, if ever. This is a perfect movie if you are an adult and want to have your intelligence insulted, or if you want your kids to grow up unable to focus on any stream of thought for more than sixty seconds.",1280016000,,1371,4.4229249011857705
1599612,5,B00005JPNY,"This movie, though targeted to younger children, is a great fantasy which many adults would enjoy.  Just seeing the glamorous Nicole Kidman playing the role of a villian and Sam Elliott with his trademark, slow and comforting drawal, made watching a delight.  I was raised on talking animals like Bambi, Buggs Bunny during the early Disney era and I found the ""animals-as-people's souls"", in The Golden Compass, quite more intriguing.  The script and animation of the souls expressed each individual's character very accurately.  Of course, National Geographic will give us the true picture of the great polar bears, but this movie endows them with a greater purpose in life than hunting and eating seals in the Arctic and raising their young cubs.  Adults will, undoubtedly, wonder why our own politians couldn't be more like the lead, warrior polar bear.  It is all great fun.

1599614,3,B00005JPNY,"When I discuss this movie with people, they are often surprised to note that it is based on a series of Novels known as the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B001IDAIKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;is the first of the three novels, and to date the only one made into a motion picture (and based of the general controversy and dismal box office number in the US it's likely to remain that way). I should start by noting that I'm not one of those people who always believes that the book is better than the movie. There are several examples of movies and TV series that really out perform their print editions; Bones, Practical Magic, etc. I do believe; however, that it should be noted that this movie is significantly different from the novel. Please note, if you are a Golden Compass book or His Dark Materials fan, you may want to rent this one before buying.

This movie is geared toward a younger child than the books. Given its intended audience it does rather well. There's not much room for character development so Lyra's actions don't always make a great deal of sense.

The biblical reference to the ""Authority"" from the book trilogy has been cleverly removed from the film so it's also not as clear what the character's motivations are. There are some spirited performances; however, from Dakota Blue Richards (Lyra), Nicole Kidman (Ms. Coulter), and Ian McKellen (Iorek Byrnison). Freddie Highmore's vocalization of Pantalaimon (Lyra's Daemon) almost made me turn off the film on 4 separate occasions.

Beyond the characters and plot, the visuals are amazing. It's very clear that this movie had a great deal of special effects budget. It was also not afraid to hold some gorey punches (pun intended) here and there.

The soundtrack isn't bad, but it's certainly not going to be iTunes' top-seller.

The bonus content on the BluRay edition of this film is definitely worth the extra for the two disc edition. Speaking of BluRay, if you are trying to decide between it and the DVD copy for this film I would highly recommend the BluRay edition. There's a lot of graphical wizardry, the kind that BluRay does extremely well.

Overall, I think it's worth a rent if you have children, or if you enjoy family type movies. As a fan of the ""His Dark Materials"" novels I was extremely disappointed, especially with the end of this film. If you are concerned about renting or purchasing this for your family due to the controversy surrounding it, as always make the decision that's right for you, but know that they've greatly downplayed the parts that caused most of the controversy in the novels (for better or worse).

1599615,5,B00005JPNY,"Amazing futuristic fantasy film based on the first of a series of three books. It was lamb-basted by the church for it's supposed ""anti-religous"" theme and ""subversion of children's minds"". Interesting how the Catholic church found the oppressive, mythical ""Magesterium"" likened to itself. In fact there was no allusion direct or implied against any bonified organized religous group... yet we are being denied our right to artistic license and free speach in the USA as a result.
I suggest flooding the studio/producers with letters demanding the two sequals be made, and true to their original format as well! The only other way of actually realising the outcome is by reading installments number two (The Subtle Knife) and three (The Amber Spyglass) in the trilogy written by Phillip Pullman.

And I think you'd have to read ""The Golden Compass"" to understand why the reason the movie didn't do better.  It wasn't a problem with the director or the actors or anything.  Rather, the book interwove two emotions:  fear and wonder, with wonder being uppermost.  The movie, for the most part a faithful adapation, also interwove the same two emotions, but with fear uppermost, and wonder taking a back seat.

BUT, if a person sits down to watch the movie and is not familiar with what all the controversy is about ""dust"", then it's a very lightweight fantasy film that just has good special effects.  I would love to see the other 2 books made into movies also, but I hear this one did not do well enough to make that happen.  As for all the ""church"" controversy, hogwash. A truly religious person is not going to be swayed by the innuendos in this tale, and non-religious people will just have those snide comments go right over their heads.  Impact to the church? NIL.

If you like Sci-Fi / Fantasy then you will enjoy this.  If not, then probably not.  It's a shame that a sequel will not be made.  Also, I do not understand the fury over billing this as an anti religous movie.  Opponents tried to paint this as a picture (and book series) aimed at convincing children that religion is silly and bad and that all intelligent people should be atheists.  Perhaps I don't try hard enough to find messages in movies - I sit back and enjoy them - but the anti religion aspect on this movie seems like quite a reach.  This will no more corrupt your children than Harry Potter. Personally, I think the true hatred of this movie by religous supporters stems from the fact that the author of the series is a confirmed atheist and they don't want to see him succeed and / or gain any type of forum.  My belief is to each their own and I would have loved to see a sequel.  Although, I must say studios are generally bloodsuckers so I'm guessing they quashed a sequel not out of pressure from the Vatican or religous advocates but rather because they felt like it wouldn't be profitable.  I'm sure if they could make money from it, they would do it in a heartbeat.  To me there is some irony that the same parents who were duped into keeping their children away from this movie are the same parents who allow their children to worship all things Harry Potter much like my generation worshipped all things Star Wars!

P.S. I grew up worshipping Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars and have enjoyed Harry Potter in the last decade.  Somehow I didn't turn out to be an atheist.",1262649600,,1759,4.3496932515337425

1599700,4,B00005JPNY,"Before I start this review, I would like to comment on the ""religious"" factors of this film. I am a Catholic and loved this! There was nothing atheist about it. The way I viewed the Magisterium was a Communist government. Even if it was a jab at the church, it was probably referencing back to old times when the people of the church did want to control everything (Uber-Christians should really learn their history). And, judging by how some people reacted to these ""atheist"" tones, they must be working for the Magisterium, trying to say what's best for others when they should just mind their own business and let people decide for themselves.

Now to the movie. Dakota Blue Richards is a very good actress and one of the very few child actors who aren't annoying. She seems undaunted for her first film and I really hope they film the next two installments as I would like to see her improve and hone her talent. Daniel Craig, Eva Green (reuniting from Casino Royale but have no scenes together), Sam Elliot and Nicole Kidman (can't believe I'm saying something good about her) are all excellent in their supporting roles. Though I will admit that Craig floats in and out of the picture like that Prudence character from Across the Universe (though not as much as her, at least Craig's character is important to the plot) and Kidman's revelation that she is Richards' mother seems a little out of left field though Mrs. Coulter could be lying. Christopher Lee has very good billing in the end credits for having one line of dialog in a very small scene. I wish the explanation of dust had gone into a little more detail instead of the Magesterium just talking about it like its a drug or whatever. Action scenes are spectacular, especially the final battle in the north. Music is also very good and, if they ever film the next two, I certainly hope they use the same composer. A fine film that I hope to be the next successful book-to-film translation like Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/James Bond.",1258502400,5,2003,4.642253521126761

Talented acting, extraordinary special effects, superior direction, and a story-line that is startling, poignant, and exceptional, makes this a movie that anyone can watch repeatedly, and from each viewing learn more.

This makes sense as both have talking animals and take place in a sort of fairy-tale land of imagination.  Both involve children who either are British or have British accents.

However, if one watches both closely, the parallels soon come to a quick halt.  C.S. Lewis' story is a transparent allegory of Jesus and it tacitly exalts Christianity & Christian virtues.  COMPASS, on the other hand, pokes fun at religion in general and has obvious allusions to the Spainish Inquisition & various other nefarious abuses-of-power by religious groups.

This, of course, is huge reason why COMPASS didn't do nearly so well at the box office as NARNIA did.  A lot of people may have mistakenly thought that they were going to get a variation on NARNIA and storyling that espouses religious doctrine.  Am sure they must have been shocked to find out that this wasn't a Christian-friendly film!

For myself, I found this to be a unique and entertaining story.  I've always been a fan of Nicole Kidman, and I applaud her for not being afraid of the Catholic societies who would condemn her for being a part of the film (which, in fact, they did).  The incorporation of the legendary Derek Jacoby brings credibility to the cast.  Dakota Blue Richards is an outstanding child actress who performed brilliantly in a difficult role.

I love the look and feel of the film, the acting performances, the atmosphere, and best of all, Iorek the Armored Bear. I am astonished that other reviewers have found it boring.

Since watching the film, I have read the original books and I agree that the books are better. But then books usually are. Also, filmmakers tend to pander to audience expecations about good guys and bad guys, whereas the lines between good and evil are much fuzzier in the books. Having said that, I still love the film. I don't see the need to compare it with the Harry Potter or Narnia movies, but if I did, the comparison would be in favour of The Golden Compass.

Looking forward to the next one (please).",1250035200,5,974,4.346153846153846

For a movie to be as good as a book for a specific person, that specific person has to make the movie. That said, the movie is saved by the actors. Although passing of the movie is a bit off (and the ending is a let down, especially now that we're pretty much assured of there not being a sequal) and the substance may be thought of as a cop out regarding going the safer route of not making more explicit reference to the evils of the church (regardless of what you're opinion is, if the book makes specific reference, you're going to offend anyway, so better to make the movie closer to the book), the actors, especially Dakota, saved the movie in my mind.

Thankfully the movie does not ""go there.""  The movie was enjoyable, lots of action and the animation of the animals was wonderful. Nicole Kidman was captivating, and what little we saw of Daniel Craig was intriguing.

The only disappointment I had with the movie was the ending--there was no ending. It was not just left open for a sequel--it felt unfinished, as though they lost the last reel.  As viewers we deserve more.

The movie may be too intense for small children, but I'm an adult and I really enjoyed it.",1246060800,2,657,4.778761061946903
1599795,5,B00005JPNY,"This is a review I have deferred for about two years to let the initial controversies surrounding this film subside. I loved this movie upon its' theatrical release and New Line has done the movie proud by the release of this two disc set.
Like the uproar by certain Church groups and related organizations over the Da Vinci Code material,this movie too was attacked by the same or similar groups for its' supposed ""heretical"" and/or ""anti-religious"" themes. I find these groups rancour quite specious and founded,on many occasion,on sheer ignorance of the material at hand for the single purpose of fear mongering in the name of ""truth"".It is appalling and disgusting at the same time.
Here is a quote by the author Phillip Pullman in an interview from Time magazine around the time of the films' initial release:""I wouldn't want to be a part of any movement that had an agenda...I'm not arguing a case. I'm not preaching a sermon. I'm not giving a lecture. I'm telling a story. Any position I take is that of a storyteller who says, 'Once upon a time, this happened.'"".
Anyone can find just about anything in what they read,see and hear. As long as one is educated and armed with the facts,no one needs to be running off willy-nilly tilting at windmills.
The story here involves a parallel world to ours where ""dust""(the stuff of life) connects everyone and everything in the universe. Lyra Belacqua(Dakota Richards)is an 11 year old whose ""Uncle"" Asriel(Daniel Craig)is a professor at a university who has discovered what he believes is the secret to this ""dust"" and mounts an expedition to the far north to prove it. However the Magisterium(the ruling body)wants him stopped as it would mean an end to their power and influence. During his trip he is captured and Lyra,befriended by Mrs Coulter(agent for the Magisterium)starts on her journey not only to rescue him but many friends and other young people who are mysteriously disappearing;courtesy of the Gobblers, the agents of the Magisterium. The head of her school(and friend to Asriel)gives her an Elithiometer(Golden Compass)which reveals the reality of any notion or event of the users wishes;the only one known to exist. When Mrs. Coulters' real and assumed purpose in ""helping"" Lyra becomes clear,Lyra escapes. During this time a group of water-faring nomads called the Egyptians step in and rescue her and assist her on her journey north. Along the way she enlists the help an aeronaut by the name of Mr Scoresby(Sam Elliot) and a polar bear in exile by the name of Iorek Byrnison(voiced by Ian Mckellin).Also a representative of the witch clan,Serafina Pekkala(Eva Green),joins in the quest. Iorek becomes invaluable to Lyra who in turn helps him re-unite with his polar bear brothers and claim his rightful place as king. After this she infiltrates the Bolvingar prison where all the children have been taken in order to seperate their bodies from their souls. A gigantic battle ensues near the end of the film with Lyra and her compatriots winning the day. The battle is not yet over though and as the movie ends she,a friend and Iorek sail away in Mr Scoresbys' air machine to continue their quest.
The movies' special effects are seamless in this film and constitute a big part of its' charm. Things like the retro but futuristic vehicles(both ground and air),the myriad of different animals that appear which contain people's souls and that constantly walk,crawl and/or fly beside them and most especially Iorek the bear that comes to astounding but believable life and who is an integral part of this film. All in all amazing to behold.
This set contains two discs and the first contains the film. Beautifully transferred with its original 2:35:1 aspect ratio and surround 5:1 sound. The second disc is chock full of specials including featurettes on Phillips the author,director Chris Weitz's screenplay,the character of Lyra,costumes,music,production design,a behind the scenes look at the films'opening in Cannes and promo tour,a closer look at the bears,the golden compass itself,daemons(the name for the animals that human souls inhabit),and many others.
In conclusion this a film for the family(for children of about 10 and up) to enjoy and savour. Its' storyline is lush and it grabs you almost from the outset. It is a time honoured good versus evil film done in a most imaginative way,with Lyra,Prof. Azriel,Iorek,Mr. Scoresby,et al on one side and the Magisterium,the Gobblers,its' rep Mrs Coulter and all their assorted henchmen on the other. The acting is top notch by everyone involved and the special effects are fabulous and bring to life one of its' chief and most beloved characters,Iorek the polar bear. This is definitely one that belongs on everyone's shelf.",1245542400,5,4750,5.029187817258883

I listened to the director's commentary, and he gave a decent reason. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen. If you're a fan, then you almost have to see it, but you shouldn't expect it to be as good as the books.

1599882,3,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass is an entertaining film with an intriguing story line. It falls short in many areas however so I'd recommend it but not very enthusiastically. The film makers build a very exotic world for the story. However, one of my main criticisms is, you know it's an artificial world. You always are aware the cast is working in front of a green screen. You never lose the feeling you're watching a digital world or get to immerse yourself in the story.  The demons or external representation of the characters souls are beautifully render. Pan, Lyra Belaqua's demon, is an excellent character.

The casting is good but the performances are only average. Nicole Kidman is great as the evil Mrs. Coulter. Her character is at times violent and always creepy and mysterious. Dakota Richards as the lead character, Lyra Belaqua, is very good and has some great scenes. The rest of the performances are only average. You've seen Sam Elliot play the same western hero a million times already and this isn't one of the better performances of it. The digital character Iorek Byrnison might be the best of the whole film. He is a drunken, exiled king of the armored bears. He is truly courageous and very easy to like with his flaws and fears.

Now to the main criticism of the film, the story. It develops very slowly, is confusing as heck at times, and does not have an ending in this film. It latterly ends with the characters wrapping up what happened here and what needs to happen in the next film. It's very disappointing. The pacing was awful. Some parts that have little to do with the story take forever to develop and other key parts are flown past with little explanation. Don't bother watching if you like your stories to have a beginning a build to a climax and an ending because you won't get that here. It might be worth waiting for the second film so you can get closure in one viewing of them both.

Additionally, I'd warn parents to view this before deciding to let their children watch it. I'm not sure some of it is really appropriate for the age I would expect to be really interested in this film. It is very dark; there are some really disturbing scenes with the children and their demons. There is also a lot of death and killing in it. It's hard to over look someone dying when their demon animal burst in to flam and is consumed to ashes. And that happens frequently here. The bear fight between Iorek Byrnison and the current bear king ends in an extremely brutal and graphic sequence.

Technically, the blue-ray disc is outstanding. The transfer is crisp, clean and highly detailed. The sound track is excellent as are the effects. I'd recommend it as a blue-ray demo disc for sure.

So, I'd recommend the film just not every enthusiastically.",1238457600,4,2770,4.608519269776877
1599883,4,B00005JPNY,I think the only reason that this film was not more successful in the U.S. is because the books were not as well known as in England.

After seeing the movie for the first time and finding out that it came from a book, we bought the three book set on Amazon and are loving reading these as well.

This is a great fantasy!!!  The writer, director and actors are all using their creative natures to create magical pieces.  Thanks and we want more....more.....more!!!!!!",1237248000,,573,4.3584905660377355
1599972,5,B00005JPNY,"and ""suspend your disbelief"" for a few hours so that you don't even realize time has gone by, you know you have an amazing creative gift given you from some inspired being out there somewhere on this earth who wrote it.

I'm not going to write about the story line since so many others did that but about how shocked I was there are movies that can still take me totally out of my own life and self-awareness (i.e. suspended disbelief) these days because I have a chronic pain illness.  But this movie is so worth seeing IF YOU ARE A DREAMER and love to ponder about all the possible life that exists in a grand, grand, creation of a universe of hundreds of billions of stars in hundreds of billions of galaxies and who knows how many planets and all of the ways other kinds of life may go about their living...

Then you will find this your favorite movie of the year to inspire more dreaming about all the big things in the cosmos, and then in this life, it will remove you from the little slice of life (1 experience in billions) that we, as humans who find ourselves as earthly beings here, are allowed.  It is based on a cosmic sized or multiple-universe-type world(s).

IF, as one reviewer said, because there is magic involved in the movie there is nothing to learn from it, then for their sake I'd reccommend staying away from all science fiction and fantasy for your own happiness because these genre's have always been about creating settings different from our own to help get around the natural human insticts and fear of change and fear of what we don't know or understand. Just look at all of history to see how that fundament of humanity of what fear of the unknown has done.  And action before thinking caused the worst damage. Esp when thinking disallowed about the opposing things. Endless wars from self-imprinted fears of beliefs and not thinking. Especially racially. And yet it still goes on in a small way in each of us daily.

For example I read a recent study that people actively only look for news that supports their views they already have -- all people on all sides. As this bias/fear is there it should be recognized as all biases should.  If we aren't aware of ourselves why be here?! But, it's not easy and takes effort. And unfortunately studies say we only get more embedded with age which makes sense.  We all want to feel safe.  Sometimes it's true that thinking leads one to feel unsafe. But it's only what you do with the thoughts that could be dangerous.

Such fictions and dreams are essenital for more reasons than I can even begin to go in to here except 1.  Allowing thoughts about everything have gotten us this amazing technical revolution in a short time for human history. And these genre's of which I speak find a way to gently slip in thoughts to let loose that would otherwise not be allowed to be thought of from a ""home world"" point of view (ie using real life's real issues).

But with thinking or kicking around a new thought, as opposed to confirming one's views, you can only gain more knowledge and life. Not lose it -- unless you choose to do so and change your mind.

Did you know a number of Arthur C. Clark's technical items/devices he created in his books to make his future world creation work the way he wanted, were read by engineers and scientists who liked the ideas from his books so much they ended up spending their lives then creating his devices, some ended up almost exactly as he described.  Some we couldn't imagine being without now such as the satelite!

But anyway, to those who want and even need to know there is more than this small slice of life - YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE of parallel universes and dreamlands to fill up the dream tank some more. And hope the rest of the Trilogy will be coming to DVD soon!

BTW--where does your mind go when you are actually living the story with the characters in something as amazing as this movie?  Which is so rare for me! :) What an interesting thing to think about!

Now THAT IS LIVING -- thinking freely in a world thaT IS hopefully seeing more freedom everywhere slowly but surely?  If scifi/fantasy authors keep planting such seeds of dreaming then it will be surely!  If there is something to preach it is to preach thinking.  Of all kinds!  Right and wrong!

OH HOW WELL THIS MOVIE/DREAM will wrap you up in wonderings and ""what if's""?  Just to get out of this place for a couple hours... so special!  And Lyra (the main character a young girl) sticks in my mind after seeing the movie - the most PHENOMENAL CHILD ACTOR - and I'm reminded of her when watching other things or talking to people and something comes up because the visuals of the movie stay like rememembering a vivid dream for a long time.  This movie will get in your soul!  What a wonderful creation - not just the movie but - the imagination, don't you agree?!

It felt it lacked the personal touch of a true sci-fi. They relived too much on the special effects to carry the movie and I felt the actors weren't believable enough.

As if they were saying hey viewer, this is sci-fi, so why should I give it my good gun-BLEEP. (even though I just think Daniel Craig is sexy even when he acts fake.)

I was impressed with visual effects, loved the variety of characters (and actors they got to do the voices), and enjoyed the adventure that was unfolding.  While the movie still contained some areas in the foundation that I questioned, had enough strengths and action to keep me moving along without stopping to focus too much on what I didn't believe.

1600038,3,B00005JPNY,"Okay movie for a New-Age *fantasy* flick. What is interesting - the Freudian psychoanalytical theory, which is invoked in cinema again.  Apparently, the magic *dust* denotes the object-cause of desire and the reservoir of libido. Since it also could mean a surplus enjoyment, it is no wonder that the *Church* (or any church-like order), at least officially, would be against it.

I have a problem with the *evil Russians* or *evil Tatars* who are portrayed running some kind of a nightmarish *kids-only* Gulag installation on Spitsbergen. You dress them all like Rasputin; let them speak a bit of broken Russian and voil - ready-to-wear agents of evil. I mean, seriously enough already with stereotypes. Perhaps kids should be spared from all this Freudian Cold-War-ish Mambo-Jumbo?",1231027200,3,783,5.256
1600039,4,B00005JPNY,"I've never read the original books by author Philip Pullman, but I heard much about them leading up to the release of this much anticipated film adaptation. One of the things I hate most about such pre-hype for a film like this is that you can't help but form biased opinions about the success or failure of the project even though you've yet to see it with your own eyes. Given that the original books were written as an expression of Mr. Pullman's atheist beliefs, which though I disagree with, I have the utmost respect for, and having heard that the movie had been changed to downplay that particular angle, I was afraid that what would be left would be a watered down, generic fantasy with a lot of special effects and action but little or no depth. So I'm happy to say that when I finally saw this film the other night, I was pleasantly surprised.

First off, one of the gripes I do have with the film is that I'm not sure that it ever really provides the audience with a full understanding of what's at stake. We quickly learn that on this world, daemons are living, physical manifestations of a person's soul that walk alongside their human counterparts, appearing in animal form. There is also reference to Dust, which is believed to connect this world with the many other parallel worlds out there, and which is somehow related to why a child's daemon can change form at will but an adult's cannot. Lord Asriel, played in the film by current James Bond star Daniel Craig, believes that he can use this discovery as a way to travel between worlds. Meanwhile, Mrs. Coulter, portrayed in a wonderfully scary way by Nicole Kidman, represents the Magisterium, an organization that seeks to, for some unexplained reason, control people through their beliefs. The Magisterium also has been kidnapping children in an evil plot involving the children's daemons. Lyra, portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, is Lord Asriel's niece, an orphan being raised at Oxford, who is given a device which is capable of discerning the truth of things. Lyra, along with her alethiometer, or golden compass, proves to be a child prophesied long ago who will ultimately determine the future of everyone.

While I can sort of fill in the gaps on my own, I never felt satisfied that I had been given a firm explanation for the Magisterium and the full implications of their plan. I suspect that this is the point where the removal of any anti-religious content may have left a gap in the story, a missing piece that was left ambiguous rather than filling it with something contrived. That absence, along with parts of the story early on that felt a bit rushed, keep me from giving the story 5 stars. But it is beautiful visually, in some ways even more so than Lord of the Rings. The story is certainly more than exciting enough for the young and young at heart, and if you pay close attention, even with the missing allusions to the books original undercurrent, you can sense the message is still there, and I felt that was a very big plus.

I will definitely be looking forward to the anticipated second film in the trilogy, and I think once you've seen it, so will you.

1600040,4,B00005JPNY,"As I am sure many people, I am not a part of the breed of fans that have read the book and then hastily decided to check out the film. In fact, until this film arose, I had never heard of anything-called ""The Golden Compass"" so it is quite an interesting film. After all a film that stars both Daniel Craig and the wonderful Nicole Kidman, regardless of whether I've read the book or not I was going to see this film.

I have to be perfectly honest and tell you that although it was a good bit of fun with a very out there premise. Set in an alternate universe where, rather than a persons soul being encapsulated within their body it manifests itself as an animal form outside the body known as Daemons. The main character Lyra is fascinated by a presentation she accidentally stumbles upon by her uncle Asriel about mysterious particles known as Dust, which is apparently a way of transporting between universes.

Her uncle is due to travel North in search of these particles, but holding no hope of going with him, she is asked to travel north with a very mysterious woman known only as Mrs. Coulter as her personal assistant. During that time, she comes into possession of the mysterious Golden Compass, which allows her to see all truths along with her companions also such as her Daemon and a large ferocious polar bear.

Even before its release, thanks to the oppressive Magisterium in the film. The Golden Compass brought in unwanted controversy as it was believed that the Magisterium was a religious undertone relating to the Catholic Church. I suppose really that unless your child is extremely intelligent, that controversy and ""message"" means pretty much nothing to them.

Due to it being a high budget fantasy film it required a lot of CGI and let me be honest and say, sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. In one of the ways it did not, work was the attempting interaction between the actors and their chosen daemon. It was especially apparent when Kidman's character hit her daemon and then attempted to apologise by hugging it. The mix between reality and CGI did work, but the faults were noticeable, but it is passable due to what it did achieve. The fight scene between a King bear and Lyras polar bear companion was also another way in which the CGI worked very well. The look of the bears was spot on and quite realistic at some points the fighting was intense and very attractive.

One of the best parts of the whole thing was the superbly frightening acting by Nicole Kidman. Her role as Mrs. Couter was something to be experienced and she really plays the role of a manipulative evil ""ice queen"" of sorts very well. Daniel Craig, although not a particularly prominent role, still managed to make the movie special and hold my interest. After all, I could not expect anything less as he is one of the reasons I decided to watch this in the first place.

It was a wonderful fantasy film and about the only thing I have negative to say about it is in relation to the Daemons. From what I saw there seemed to be no explanation as to why the Daemons took the shape they did. Lyra's Daemon was that of a cat most of the time but took different shapes from time to time. Mrs. Couters Daemon was that of a golden monkey and Uncle Asriels was a tiger.

Other than that little discrepancy, there is honestly nothing to complain about with this picture.",1230422400,2,3376,4.524590163934426

1600042,3,B00005JPNY,"WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!

I suppose it's not surprising, what with the current trend of adapting fantasy literature into films, that Philip Pullman's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/0375838309/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;should become a major motion picture. What is surprising is who ended up writing the screenplay and directing the film. Chris Weitz, best known as one of the producers of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B0009ZE9VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>&nbsp;films, seems an odd choice to adapt the epic fantasy story for the silver screen and yet his commercial success gave New Line Cinema the courage to greenlight the project.
Adapting Philip Pullman's novel proved to be a daunting task and though much of the more controversial subject matter within the plot has been omitted, the film is fairly faithful to the conceit of the book. But the film suffers from a lack of thematic depth, which can be attributed to the removal of the book's religious and political commentary.
It should also be noted that the film ends in an abrupt and emotionally unsatisfying manner. Apparently this is because the studio was not confident that the film would be successful and they didn't wish to end the film with a cliffhanger.

The story, which is set in a universe parallel to our own where people's souls take on the physical form of animals called dmons, follows a feisty and rebellious young girl named Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who lives at Jordon College in England. After a series of widespread kidnappings Lyra half-jokingly promises to rescue her best friend Roger if he is ever kidnapped. Little does she suspect that such a thing will actually happen.
When Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel, makes a visit to the college to announce a startling discovery in the Far North, Lyra has no idea of the far-reaching implications. Lord Asriel has discovered a connection between the mystical substance Dust and the divisions that separate parallel worlds. This controversial revelation places both he and Lyra under the watchful eye of the Magisterium, a vast totalitarian government, which uses religion to subjugate the masses. But all is changed when the beautiful and authoritative Mrs. Coulter invites Lyra to join her at her home and then journey with her to the Far North.
Before her departure, Lyra is given a tremendous gift from the Master of the College, who bestows unto her an alethiometer (or Golden Compass). The alethiometer has the power to tell the truth to anyone who can read its symbols.
At first Lyra relishes the attention and the luxuries that Mrs. Coulter showers upon her, but then Lyra begins to see a controlling, manipulative side to her new guardian. One night Lyra and her dmon Pan come across a list of children's names and to her shock, she finds Roger's name is on the list. She then realizes that Mrs. Coulter is behind the kidnappings. Lyra runs away, but she is pursued by sinister agents. Luckily she is rescued by Gyptians, a nomadic people, who are seeking revenge on the Magisterium.
Learning to read the alethiometer, Lyra soon realizes that a great destiny is set upon her. She meets and befriends an Armoured Bear named Iorek Byrnison, a beautiful witch named Serafina Pekkala, and an aeronaut named Lee Scoresby. Lyra continues her travels north, and along with her new allies, overcomes many perils including savage Armoured Bears, and soldiers.
Yet nothing can prepare Lyra for what she finds in the Far North. There she learns what became of the kidnapped children and the horrible truth about Mrs. Coulter. In the end Lyra and her companions must face the power of the Magisterium, and either succeed in freeing their world and all others from its tyrannical grasp or die trying.

The film features a spectacular cast including Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, and Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala. The film also features Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, and the voices of Ian McKellen, Freddie Highmore, and Kathy Bates. The entire cast is superb especially the young Dakota Blue Richards, whose portrayal of plucky heroine Lyra has unfairly been overlooked by most critics.
The Golden Compass, which is the first part in a trilogy, failed to become a hit in the U.S., so it's questionable whether or not the next two books in the series shall ever be adapted into films. Sadly, this means that the adventures of Lyra (at least cinematically) are left without an ending. This certainly detracts from the enjoyment of watching the film, but perhaps there is still hope that the next two books will be given a cinematic treatment and thus provide viewers with a sense of closure.
It's unfortunate that the film was a Box office disappointment and that we may never find out how Lyra's adventures come to their end, but there are reasons for the film's poor reception from audiences. One of those reasons is New Line's overly ambitious and foolhardy marketing strategy. In the very first trailer they dared to make a comparison between this film and the beloved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>. This in itself was like committing Box Office suicide. Another reason for the film's failure to attract large audiences is the controversial thematic materials of the books. A major theme of Philip Pullman's books is that of rebelling against authority and religious dogma. Cleverly (and some would say subversively) exploiting taboos within Judaeo-Christian beliefs, Pullman weaves a tale of redemption, not through a higher power but through the power of the self. As a result the Catholic Church boycotted the film, deeming it heretical in its content.
Overall, The Golden Compass is an admirable yet deeply flawed epic. Though it features a strong cast and gorgeous visual effects, these can also be found in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B001DPHDIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>&nbsp;series. What really hurts the film is the inexperience of its writer/director and the lack of faith that the studio placed in him. It's ironic, but ultimately the film about a Golden Compass finds itself lost.

1600117,3,B00005JPNY,"I generally liked the beginning of this film that had a premise that all humans have their own ""demons"".  Demons grow as the soul of their owners grows.  They are also the opposite sex of their human counterparts (i.e. girl would have a male demon and vice versa) and take animal form.  In the beggining young adults have spirit that is free and uncompromising; but the local ""ministry"" wants them to obey and conform unconditionally.  So this is a universal battle of good and evil in its psychological form.  There is also a metaphysical component of the movie where narrator mentions parallel universe and people form the parallel world that are connected by the universal ""dust"". I liked the fact that the main character of the film is a girl - that premise gives some hope to humanity of this little made up universe.  Also the visual effects are great.  Most ""demons"" are such fantastic animals full of personality and charm.  cast is definitely superior, but by the middle of the film - story starts to fade and becomes boring.

I had heard about the controversy about this movie & religion...and on a 13 hour flight from Australia back to LA- I thought it would be good to watch. I mean the cast alone- had to be decent. It also would give me a chance to watch it before I showed it to my 6 year old. WOW- was I glad I watched it first! First off- do not let you 6 year old watch this movie.  IT IS NOT A SMALL CHILD'S MOVIE. A) It is scary. It has deamons in it - that are vicious. Not only that the kids are being kidnapped - stolen. Ok- what child ,and parent for that fact, would not be freaked out by that. Seriously - if I let my kids watch this movie- they would be sleeping with us for the next week. Trust me- not for elementary kids.
B) It's dumb. The movie goes very fast- and apparently leaves out the majority of the information that a person who has NOT read the book needs in order to figure out what the heck is going on. If you have read the book- then you will get it. The rest of us- just still trying to figure all the weird scary stuff in the movie by reading reviews on Amazon;)

But I was excited about Golden Compass because it was a well written book and I was interested to see how it was ported to the big screen.

Sadly, it was dumbed-down so much that most of the plot of the book - which was unraveled skillfully in the book - is revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie through exposition.

You are flat out told that people in this world wear their souls on the outside of their body in the form of familiar animals.  In the book you figure it out on your own and feel clever about it when you do so.

This is the case for half the plot of the book. It is just told to you in synopsis form by a narrator and all of the joy of DISCOVERING things is taken from you.

I don't know who the director is, but I intend to find out and avoid his future movies. Hopefully they hire him to finish out the series (doubtful, since this one was dismal at the box office) so he won't ruin any other movies for a while.

In short, if you liked the book - and Golden Compass was a good book, even if you are an intolerant right wing person this book shouldn't have offended you, they don't start really offending the Catholics until book three in my opinion - then you will be disappointed by the movie.

Unfortunately, we marketed the movie all wrong in the US, and labeling
the series as the ""anti-Narnia chronicles"" did not help boost its
popularity among the audience here, which reveres CS Lewis's creation.

detracts from the wonder and Christian themes found in Narnia.  If
anything, having read the two series side by side as a kid, I was able
to appreciate the parallels between stories, as well as the different
worldviews of each author.

1600216,1,B00005JPNY,"True, it's been a about three or so years since I've read Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the books upon which this film is based, if you didn't know. But as that time three years ago was my second time going through the trilogy, I still like to think I had a decent memory of them along with a decent opinion. At the risk of offending fans, I always felt Pullman's characters--Lyra, Mrs. Coulter, Will, the whole gang--to be on the weak side of characterization, a few hops from being completely two-dimensional. STILL, I thought the story and theme to be on another plane entirely, certainly enough to make the books as famous as they are and even flesh out an entertaining movie.

I promise, I tried my best to like this movie, for the sake of those books. For the sake of Sam Elliot and the goddess Nicole Kidman. Heck, even for that cute little new girl. They all did their best, but frankly this movie was fluff, and it's hard to work with fluff. How could they take such thought- and controversy- provoking books and turn them into fluff? I'm hardly an atheist, but I had appreciated the story's urge for free thought, free will, and a keener look at authority. The smidgen they put in here was all too welcomed, but not enough to give this movie proper heart and soul.

What we are left with is a rushed train of lovely cinematography, scenery, and special effects that accompany an equally rushed plot. Yes, there is a lot of story to get into this movie, but making that the priority left me cold toward these characters who were weak in the book and utterly two-dimensional on screen. I felt like I was an infant teenager being instructed in the ways of generic fantasy. Talking bears? Soul-daemons? Other worlds? Texas as a country? Wonderful, fantastic ideas that appeared on the big screen like toys in hurried images.

I'm sorry, but while the director was having fun with the camera, the audience was confused by the random jumping from scene to scene, plot to plot.

So maybe it was a tragic result of putting a plot-based rather than character-based story in a movie that led to all story and show and no emotional depth. Maybe it was a tragic result of playing it safe by removing all blatant references to religion. Maybe I'm just a whiney book purist.

All I know is that the result was flashy, heartless, and boring.",1220140800,44,2346,4.562945368171022

1600274,4,B00005JPNY,"I never heard of the books but then as far as i knew young Mr. Potter was all the rage. I had to give this film a pass when it first came out even though I wanted to see it. Life got in the way and many moons later I finally viewed the film on DVD, a rental to boot.
I have to say, I'm not sure why this film has so many mixed reviews when I, my wife and college age daughters all loved it.
Why? Because we did. We found the characters to be both complex and sympathetic. The story is very intriquing and well paced. I'm glad it was rated PG13 because it had a few rough spots (the polar bear warriors fighting was particularly savage). As I don't own this film (a problem I'll rectify soon) I have to forego with explicit descriptions and character's names since it has been a few weeks since we viewed the film. Despite that it left its mark on me. The young lady (Lyra?) was a treat. She was payed with just the right amount of precociousness and innocence as well as drive to make her the perfect foil for adults who disregard youth as simply precocious and naive. Her rescues, escapes and minor triumphs are all worthy of acclaim. Her friends (rescuers and defenders) may have their agendas but they also sincerely help her. The polar bear warrior king was (voiced by Ian McKellen) was perfect as her loyal protector with a history that needed to be resolved.
I've read the complaints about this film and was prepared for the worst. It's too bad their noise prevailed in making this film so unpopular.
Now, thanks to that rabble, I'll have to read the books to get to the finish of the tale. That's not so terrible but this franchise deserved better than it received at the box office. I'm sure the nay-sayers are delighted in their results.
As for the complaints that this film (and the books?) impugned ""mother church"", well, I saw no such evidence to validate those claims.
No surprise there.",1219795200,7,1900,4.370056497175141
1600275,3,B00005JPNY,"I watched this movie with no memory or knowledge of the controversy surrounding its release.  Apparently both sides of the religion and free speech argument had plenty to say.  I'm not here to stir that pot.  Certainly the controversy precipitated a mediocre box office showing upon the film's release just before Christmas.  Yet, the box office intake quadrupled once it hit the international scene, garnering over $360 million.  Instead, I rented the DVD with only the knowledge that my wife and kids refused to watch.  No matter, there are plenty of films they have self banned to include the Harry Potter series, and I had nothing else to watch on a Sunday afternoon while they were at church.

As the plot opens we are thrust into a fantasy world where our characters exist in a parallel universe.  Their souls exist in the form of different kinds of animals called daemons and walk side by side with their human hosts throughout their lives.  The kid's daemons can change shapes into different animals, but by the time they are adults the souls become one kind of animal.  Our main character Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan who is somewhat of a leader among her peers and challenges her friends, foes, and adults to get to the bottom of a mystery.  Her child friends are being kidnapped by the ""Gobblers"" and taken to a far away place in the north.  Her mission is to somehow find them and save them from whatever dark fate awaits them.  At the start of her journey we meet her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) who is trying to prove the existence of ""dust"" which he believes exists in a parallel universe and enters a person's body through their daemon.  Lord Asriel obtains funding from the College and proceeds north to prove his theory.  Mean time Lyra his taken away from the college by Mrs. Coulter (Nichol Kidman) under the story of being her assistant.  Lyra is a little wary of her new found supporter and before she leaves the college is given an alethiometer by the master of the college.  The alethiometer, also called the Golden Compass, is an ancient device banned by the Magesterium, the ruling religious party, because it can be used to find the answer to any question as long as the user is skilled in the interpretation of the device.  Confusing yet?  Lyra escapes her would-be supporter and captor and enlists the services of many adults to include the Gyptians, a head witch, a Texan aeronaut (Sam Eliot), and an outcast armored polar bear as she heads north to solve the mystery and rescue her friends.  The pace and sequence of this trek was at a minimum confusing and downright disjointed.  I found myself wondering who edited this thing because the transitions from one plot line to the next were as if something important was left on the cutting room floor.  For example, Lord Asriel is captured by some nasty tribes of the north and for nearly an hour of the flick we don't know his fate.  Then suddenly a narrator says basically he's OK because he bribed his captors....what?  The ending seemed absolutely abrupt, and apparently the original ending was deleted in order to bring it back as the start of a planned sequel.  On the good side however, the special effects were excellent and garnered an Academy Award.  The acting OK and predictable, especially the somewhat type cast antagonist Nichol Kidman and our rustic hero Sam Eliot.  I'm thinking kids could probably follow this better than I and would be thoroughly entertained.  We have a kid hero on a mission of mercy assisted by all her new found friends and she is the only one that can read the Golden Compass to keep everyone on track.  I probably won't be buying this one, but it is certainly worth a watch...that is unless you have religious reservations.",1219795200,,3760,4.689024390243903
1600276,2,B00005JPNY,"I imagine the books are actually more descriptive than the movie for I found this to be somewhat confusing at times. The premise itself lasts for a mere few moments in the film, but, while it sounded interesting, I am sure it is better and more clearly explained in the book. All this talk of Dust and Daemons and witches and prophecies, it was all just too much to fit into the span of 2 hours.

The acting is all quite good, though Daniel Craig is barely in the film. The special effects are truly wonderful and first rate and is really the only thing that keeps your interest.

The plot is all over the place and jumbled. And it is certainly not helped by the awful editing. It jumps way too quickly from scene to scene and we never really know how much time has passed. That is probably the biggest flaw of the film, next to the script.

Furthermore, the ending that pretty much leaves off in the middle of nowhere is desperately in need of a sequel. But from what I have heard, since the movie turned out to be not so profitable, no word of a second movie has been heard, which is unfortuate. Perhaps as a trilogy, as it was meant to be, it can turn out to be a perfectly watchable and possibly enjoable film. But as it stands right now, it is unimpressive and pointless.",1219708800,2,1276,4.264462809917355
1600277,2,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass (Chris Weitz, 2007)

I am very much in love with His Dark Materials, the Phil Pullman trilogy from which this film gets its sensibility. I tried not to let that affect my judgment while watching this, and I knew going in that no filmmaker would be able to replicate the brilliance of the books. But, even before the movie came out, I knew we were in trouble; Chris Weitz (American Pie) was slated to write and direct. You want to tell me this guy can do Pullman justice? Then came the reports, in 2004, that Weitz was taking some liberties with the script (those who've both read the books and seen the movie are all too well aware of those). How good could it be? I got the expected answer: nowhere near good enough.

Dakota Blue Richards stars as Lyra Belacqua, the girl around whom everything in the books turns. Her character is the second most notable thing toned down; many of the book's critics rightly point out that Lyra is a shrill, almost harridan-like character in the first book, while the intention here seems to have been to make her cuddly, likable, and full of wonder. Which kind of makes the whole character-development-through-growth-and-change thing null and void (and, as we all know, one of the main rules of writing is that your main character must somehow change). As well, the good guys and the bad guys have been desperately simplified here, and yet paradoxically made somewhat less monstrous/heroic than in the books; I'm still trying to figure out how that happened. The cast (with Daniel Craig as the main good guy and Nicole Kidman as the winter queen-like Mrs. Coulter), however, does the best with what they've got, and a number of the performances are quite good, if you can divorce them from the source material. The special effects are, of course, stunning. As we learned from the horrible adaptations of Eragon and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Hollywood seems to think they can come up with another Lord of the Rings (in terms of box office receipts) as long as they keep the cutting-edge effects coming. They neglected to note Jackson's attention to the character depth and development in his seemingly legendary adaptations of Tolkein.

Do yourself a favor and see the movie before reading the books. That way you won't know what you're missing (and many of the plot holes will not show up for you, though you will probably wonder why as character like Serafina Pekkala-- who should be a major character-- just kind of pops up now and again, then disappears), and you can go back later, read the book, and actually understand what it was Pullman was on about. **",1219190400,,2629,4.698481561822126
1600278,2,B00005JPNY,"This movie (and I assume the book) started out with what could have been a great premise. People in a parallel universe live with their souls outside their bodies.

  The special effects in the movie made the scenes wonderful to watch. However, I didn't go to the theater in order to go to a kind of moving picture art museum; I went to see a movie. And a movie requires enough character development for me to care whether or not the heroine lives or dies or the person she's trying to save lives or dies. Consequently, there's no comparison between this and Lord of the Rings. None at all.

  People who read the book already might have had the character development in their heads. And if so, maybe that's how someone could give this thing three stars.

  So what's even worse than the lack of character development (and therefore lack of a story worth caring about) is that the movie didn't even get close to resolving like Lord of the Rings did at the end each segment. And you can't call the end of the movie a cliff hanger because....you don't care what happens to the characters next.

  But the thing that was most alarming about this film was how directly the author of the book (or the film makters)attack the Catholic Church, if not people of faith in general. I had heard some of the religious hoopla about the film before I went to see it, but there's been religious hoopla about movies before that didn't amount to very much(Example: The Last Temptation of Christ) That is NOT the case here.

Even though I'm not Catholic and am very aware of the Catholic Church's troubled history and some of its abuses, I could see that this movie was not a representation of a difference of opinion OR simply lopsided in its representation of organized religion. It was a hate-fest. I suppose this should have been clear from the beginning of the movie--before I saw how the Catholic imagery was handled--but I was trying to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. However, I doubt there's another reason to name the souls outside the body ""demons,"" no matter how you spell it, other than to put Catholics and people who believe in God down. (Except for creating enough religious hoopla and controversy that people go to see the movie)

  Then again, it also seems like the author must have been hurt very deeply at some point by someone who CLAIMED to be a person of faith which is a very sad thing. And I'm sorry for him or her.

  But back to the movie--I almost hope someone redoes the movie (and the book it's based on) and does the story again without the anti-religious messages. I know there's a good story to be built around humans having their souls outside the body. I just know it.",1218844800,,2695,4.496919917864476
1600279,5,B00005JPNY,"I just had to stop and do a quick review of this movie.  This is the first review of a movie I have ever done.  The reason I had to review this one in particular is because while glancing through DVDs on Amazon.com I noticed this one had only 3 stars. What???  I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Definitely one of the best ""family"" movies ever.  Sometimes I find myself falling asleep during ""family"" movies.  Not this one. The only thing I can think of to why it has only 3 stars is because of the bad rep it got before they even started filming it. I'm one of those people who like to actually view a movie before talking about it. I, like many other people, got the emails ""warning"" me not to watch it. It's anti-God. You will be supporting Atheists. Well, I have also watched Weeds, Hostel, and Veggie Tales. Does that make me a smoking, serial killer, who sees talking Veggie's???  It's a movie people! If you haven't seen this movie, please watch it!  I believe you and your family will love it and will be waiting for the sequel to come!

1600280,4,B00005JPNY,"Due to the not so great reviews and the supposed complexity of the story if you didn't read the books, I was not expecting to really like this one, but hey the library was renting it.  I watched it with my 8 year old, and we had to laugh as we remembered picking it out at the library  and a friend of my daughter saw the movie in my hands and proclaimed ""it has no God in it"". A lot of movies don't, so I didn't really care.
  Anyways, we put the movie in and I told my daughter to really pay attention and I was able to follow and 'get' what they were talking about even though I hadn't read any of the books.  I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, even though my 8 year old couldn't follow it all, and I think she was even a bit spooked at some scenes.  I put it up there with the Narnia series, definitely better than Eragon and even better than the latest dreary Harry Potter.  I still don't get the religion aspect of it, I watch a movie for enjoyment, not critical analysis.

I love my science fiction/fantasy and didn't want get that terrible sinking feeling when you know it could have been so much better. When I finally watched the movie on cable I was entranced, the movied is very well made, has great characters and is very well casted and acted.

At this point I should say that I haven't read the book so am viewing the story and movie with fresh eyes. I also don't really care whether the whole thing is a dig at Catholicism. Stand alone, this is a really entertaining fantasy movie and I would recommend it to anyone. In fact I am now going out to buy a copy of the movie to have in my collection.

Not being her biggest fan, I think this is Nicole Kidman's best role in years. She was another reason why I was prepared to dislike the movie, but I think her casting here is perfect. In fact I don't think they've put a foot wrong in any of the casting choices, although unfortunately Daniel Craig doesn't get to do very much.

So, if you aren't looking for a faithful translation of a favourite book but want to watch a well made entertaining movie - get The Golden Compass. Who wouldn't want a Battle Bear on their side!!!",1217548800,2,1263,4.298319327731092

I didn't read the book.
I thought the movie was excellent.

I rented this from Amazon Unbox out of sheer lack of anything better.  I was expecting a cheesy kids movie, perhaps not unlike Narnia.

What I got was a good story with fantastic special effects throughout and a whole lot more violence than I had anticipated.  I'm honestly surprised that they got away with a PG-13 rating.  No gore, but plenty of killings.

All of the standard fantasy genre elements are there (strangely, this is why some people rated it poorly) -- you got your drunken warrior brought out of retirement to bring down a king and generally save the day; you got your evil-witch-type person, your good-witch-type person, your evil government workers, your easily fooled scholars and your mystical device that everyone wants in the hands of a girl.

It's a winning formula and made for an enjoyable movie.  I give it 5-stars on the condition that they are making the next installment.  I would have to deduct at least 1 star, maybe 2 if they simply let it end with this one, which was clearly the intro to an intended series.",1217376000,4,1328,4.542016806722689

The original print version is both innovative and tendentious -- an absorbing fantasy world built as a means for the author to exercise his strong antipathy towards organized religion. The movie glosses over the anti-religious message, although not quite to the extent I'd imagined. The condensed plotline can be a bit jumpy, but on the whole this is an enjoyable action film, with the social commentary lurking just below the surface -- it's dumbed-down a little, but still basically the same as the book.

Never mentions anything about the religious beliefs behind Dust and its connection to children and their Daemons.  I personally don't see how they can make the 2nd film....because thats what it most deals with...(atleast as far as I have read into it so far.)

1600373,3,B00005JPNY,"I didn't want to be confused by learning what this movie was about by first reading other people's reviews. This movie is a combination of The Wizard of Oz; Narnia, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; Invaders From Mars, and perhaps bits and pieces of others.
  The Magisterium is a group that wants to kidnap kiddies (and presumably everyone and anyone else), so as to make them have unquestioned obedience and become one of THEM. Our heroine Lyra is perhaps the only one who can keep the Magesteriun from conquering the world. She is given a Golden Compass, but she can use it only if she is THE CHOSEN ONE. (Where have we heard that before?)
  Speaking of the golden compass itself, it seems the further the movie goes along everybody-- the good guys, the bad guys, and everybody else in between-- loses interest and gets apathetic about the golden compass. Toward the end everybody knows she has the golden compass. A number of the evil adults could've just manhandled our heroine Lyra and grabbed it from her, but they treat it like it is just a mildly amusing topic of conversation-- such as, ""Did you ride your bike today?"" or, ""Did you hug your dolly today?""
  There are a bunch of witches flying about, and one of them-- a beautiful woman whose name escapes me-- occasionally lands and talks with Lyra. But nobody seems to know if these witches are from the East or from the West. At one point Dorthy-- er, I mean Lyra-- asks the big ol' bear if they are good witches or bad witches, and even the big ol' bear says he doesn't know.
  Then we come to Nicole Kidman. I wish she could've dressed a little more sexy-- like a strapless & backless cocktail dress, with maybe slits up each side, but she dresses more conservatively than I would've liked.
I read reviews in the paper where it was said that Nicole Kidman was largely absent in the movie, but I think she shows up about as much and as often as any of the other adults.
  At one point in the movie we get a fight to the finish between two big ol' bears for the right to be called Papa Bear of the North. There is a nice scene or two that leads up to it, such as when our just kidnapped Lyra finds herself presented to the bad ol' bear, and she engages in a verbal duel with it about how she would be more valuable to him alive than dead. It's the sort of thing James Bond would do if he were to suddenly find himself prisoner in front of his arch enemy. Okay, so the two bears have their fight, and the good one wins; and the bear army stands up on its hind legs, lift their heads up, and they all go, ""Yaoooooooo...!"" And then everybody seems to forget about the bear army.
  One thing I really liked about the movie is the fantastic photography, and I don't just mean the special effects. Just the little scenes where people are alone in an office are masterpieces of photography. This movie was one of those rare gems where it was done a little better than it had to be in a number of places. Movies like that are always a pleasant surprise for me.
  Except I didn't like the battle scene at the end of the movie, which takes place at midnight in the snow. I think it is unethical for a movie to skimp on the budget by making the battle scenes take place in the middle of the night.
  All in all it wasn't such a bad movie, and the movie is a fun movie to write a review about. But, in the sequel we really need Nicole Kidman to dress a little more sexy. It may be out of character and incomprehensible for Nicole to be dressed up as if she's ready for cocktails, or as if she's ready for her next photo shoot, but the movie is already incomprehensible, and some of us bigger boys could use a little something extra to occupy our minds as we sit through The Golden Compass, II.",1217203200,2,3748,4.265162200282087

1600378,1,B00005JPNY,"Once upon a time, there was a show called Mystery Science Theater 3000. The premise of this show was to take bad movies from bygone days and riff snarky comedy off of them.

Watching MST3k (as it was known by its fans, the MSTies), I was always led to wonder about the original films. For most of them, presumably, there was a day when the movie was taken kind of seriously. I mean, maybe not Manos, but some of those others -- they had writers, directors, and actors who wanted to produce a decent, money-making product (not to mention the investors/producers!). I also bet that a number of the movies spoofed by Joel, Mike & the bots had fans at one point. That they were not complete flops at the theater, or in the minds of the theater-goers.

In many respects, cinema has changed from then to now. Budgets are up all-around, and standards have changed so that we're not likely to see the zippers on monsters anymore. But, as the expression goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bad writing is still bad writing. Zippers on costumes have been replaced with bad CG effects. And high-budget schlock is arguably worse than the low-budget variety. I expect that 30 years from now, we'll again be able to support an MST3k-type venture. If so, certainly there are movies from our age that they could slam with justice.

I submit to you that The Golden Compass is one of those movies.

Reading Philip Pullman's novel was a decent experience. I enjoyed it. After having read the following two novels in his trilogy, I eventually decided that (sadly) Pullman doesn't really know what he was doing, and that The Golden Compass was more the exception than the rule.

Watching this film, where all of the main plot events are presented at a break-neck, frenetic pace, it made me feel foolish for ever having liked the first novel to begin with. The characters are cardboard (what acting talent went to waste, here!), the plot events are unbelievable (even given the grand latitude I cut children's fantasy), and whatever thematic material there is, is convoluted and obscure.

This isn't a good movie. It stuffs a mess of exposition into an opening voice over then runs from event to event without time to enjoy anything. I remember in reading the novel that there was some time at the beginning to get to know Lyra before she set out with Mrs. Coulter; here, it happens in the space of about 15 minutes. Seeing the characters come to life points out their basic absurdity, like Lee Scorsby who I could take somewhat seriously in the novel, but not at all here -- he becomes a Texan caricature. Even with its CG world and creatures, this movie never achieves the sense of wonder of, say, a Neverending Story; it has no time for a sense of wonder, and Iorek and Serafina Pekkala are cold substitutes for the likes of Falkor.

At the least, the movie tries to address some of the shortcomings of Pullman's book, in reorganizing the final events to end on the main plot's climax, and small things like making Lyra's the only extant alethiometer. But those (good) changes can't overcome the central weaknesses of the story which are only heightened by seeing it try to come to life on the screen.

His Dark Materials is often compared (grossly unfairly) with The Lord of the Rings. They are similar, however, in that I'd imagine it would be hard to make either into good films, given the amount of action and detail in them. The Lord of the Rings was given the running time and the care to pull it off in glorious fashion. The Golden Compass, however much money was put into it, was a failure. It disappoints its source material which, in the final analysis, was never all that great. The only good thing to really come out of this film is that, it did so poorly both financially and critically, that the sequels will almost certainly not get made.

Another good can be made from this film: fodder for a future version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. What do you think, sirs?",1216684800,14,3985,4.593530239099859

But it is smart, well acted, well written, and stunning to watch.  Most of all, it is a wonderful and brilliantly thought out mythology. One of the most creative and thorough I have seen.

I find it funny that half the negative reviews say it moved too fast, and the other half say it was too boring. I thought it was just wonderful, and can hardly wait for the next movie!!  PS. To the people who say this bombed, it has done EXTREMELY WELL in Europe!",1216339200,2,611,4.4375
1600451,2,B00005JPNY,"This movie is fun to watch for the CGI world, and the acting is generally fine, but those are the only good parts. The overall storytelling is terrible, and the characters' motivations are never explained.

It starts in the narration at the beginning when we're told that the Magisterium wants to preserve their truth so they've destroyed all the alethiometers (which reveal hidden truths) and banned the mention of dust. What does the Magisterium fear from dust?? We're never told. And what ""truths"" is the Magisterium trying to protect? We're never told. The movie basically says, ""They're the bad guys"" but gives no other explanation.

What is the motivation of Nicole Kidman's character to do what she does? We're never told. How do the Gyptians (or whatever they're called) know that the missing kids have been taken to the north? We're never told.  Why does the movie billing say that it stars Daniel Craig when he only appears in the first five minutes? We're never told!

However, we are ""told"" lots of the story. Instead of *showing* the story to us, several of the characters have long lines explaining all sorts of things for the benefit of the audience. Boring and contrived. And two characters tell Lyra bits of information that she uses later in the story, but the characters have no reason to tell her those things at the time that they tell her. Very awfully contrived.

One of the worst aspects of this movie is that it is an incomplete first installment that makes no attempt to wrap up any story lines so that the audience feels any sense of closure. The Harry Potter stories are all complete in themselves. The Narnia stories are all complete in themselves. This movie is just an ad for sequels. By the very end of the movie they have managed to assemble most (not all) of ""the team"" that is obviously intended to go on together. But even that is incomplete, with Lyra saying ""Now let's go pick up my dad and add him to the team"" but then the movie ends. They don't rescue dad. They don't explain the dust. They don't explain anyone's motivations. And they don't give the audience a satisfying movie experience.

I haven't read the book, but I'll be generous and assume that the author did a much better job with all this, and they just couldn't find a way to fit all the bits into the movie. Look elsewhere for a well-done fantasy movie. I hope they don't waste money and time on a sequel.",1216339200,6,2410,4.606060606060606

I guess the production team (New Line) wants to sell the ending as another trip to the theater and more DVD sales.

1600454,3,B00005JPNY,"Going into this movie, I was either expecting to get hit over the head with the atheist book of nothingness, or sit through a torturous movie that defines why the fantasy genre should just give up now. And while I did not get hit over the head, nor was I tortured, I was just bored. And yes, the fantasy genre just keeps sinking lower with every copycat that tries to make a fast buck with a big budget. Really people, not every ""bestselling"" book that has the genre of fantasy should be made into a movie.

The story and mythology had me more confused then that time when I woke up on the moon, then realized it was just a dream. And if confusing wasn't enough, it was just plain weird. I mean, everybody except the polar bears and the witches had an animal following them all over the place, which was somehow connected to their soul or whatever, and these animals were called ""demons."" Which is even more confusing since the demons or witches in the movie aren't really ""demons"" or ""witches.""

The visual effect and action are what really keep the movie on its feet though. The ""Steam-Punk"" look of the cities, and the sheer magnificence of the backgrounds are sure to impress. In terms of action, to add to more confusion, the fight between polar bears, reminded me a lot of the fight between Peter and King Miraz from Narnia 2, in the fact that it didn't excite me, and tended to lean boring, since it was fight for the sake of fight, for fight's sake.

But don't let cute, almost Narnian look of this movie fool you, this is not for kids at least under 13, because you will scare the crap out of them, and even kids under 10-13 will have a hard time processing the film's more tense moments, and the sheer evality of the villains.

However, the film does deliver in the climax when Lyra escapes from the ""experiment"" proceeds to blow up the place, then run into a battle with a bunch of Russin lookin' characters with swords. And although it would have been a lot cooler if the Polar Bear brought his army to the battle, but hey, I'll take what I can get from this film. The battle offers the film's most exiting moments, and actually shows a glimpse of hope of a good movie.

The casting is rather good. Whether the cast was used to their full potential is another thing. Sam Elliot is great in his role, as is Nicole Kidman. The girl who played Lyra was good and kept you interested. But the voice cast on the other hand was thrown away. They were all interchangeable, and could have, and probably should have worked with lesser known actors portraying the roles, since no voice performance really stood out, or was in the least bit memorable. And even though Daniel Craig was put as a featured star, he was in the film for all of five minutes. Christopher Lee on the other hand could have had 30 seconds.

Fortunately, this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, instead of the 2 hours it could have been. Unfortunately, this movie banked way too much on having sequels, so the ending is hanging off a cliff with 1 finger. It offers no satisfaction, and it makes you wait for a sequel that probably will never come now. I mean, nothing is really resolved, except for a couple of side-quests. No bad guys are killed, and nothing is really done.

And to make matters worse, the credits song takes the award for WORST credits song of all time. It's a lazy effort with pathetic lyrics that has the musical-quality of singing rocks. And frankly, singing rocks is a lot more entertaining.

Random Rant: I was disappointed that the polar bear didn't drink Coke at any point in the movie, and Coke didn't have any advertising campaign associated with the movie that I can remember.

And although I have not, and will not read the source material, I'm glad they didn't stick to it. The movie was made better for me because I didn't feel like I was being preached at, although I expected to be. And while watching the movie, you don't feel like you're being whacked over the head with some atheistic crap. Sorry to offend all you people that believe in nothing, which is something (confusing I know), but Philip Pullman is the most offensive thing this side of a Nas record.

So overall, while this movie does have its moments; they are few and far between. Between the moments are a lot of information that flies over your head, a story that doesn't make much sense, and plot-turns and side-quests that are there just for the sake of being there, and don't really make sense. I don't care if the movie is congruent with the book, just give me a good movie.",1215907200,3,4550,4.44484412470024
1600455,3,B00005JPNY,"2007's ""The Golden Compass"" has a lot going for it: an outstanding cast, a high concept plot, and astonishingly good special effects. It is all the more frustrating that after a good running start, the movie leaves its story seriously incomplete.

In the alternate universe of The Golden Compass, people's souls, called daemons, are embodied as animals that walk or fly in company with their owners. The people in this universe dress in the manner of the early 20th century but use of mixture of old and new technologies. They are controlled by the Magisterium, a mysterious, semi-religious organization dedicated to peace at the expense of free will and other inconvenient aspects of individuality.

At the center of the story is one Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards), a precocious and brave young orphan in the care of a university. Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is a seeker of truth; he leaves early in the movie for the Far North, to discover the origins of a mysterious dust that may provide a link to other worlds. After his departure, a Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman as ice queen), arrives to take Lyra in hand and follow Lord Asriel to the North. It seems that Lyra is special; the university secretly entrusts her with a golden compass that only she can read and that tells the truth about all things.

Lyra shortly becomes aware that Mrs. Coulter is far from being the smooth society lady she appears to be. She escapes and links up with a group of sea-going gypsies to travel to the Far North herself. Her mission and that of the gypsies is to free a group of kidnapped children, one of whom is Lyra's best friend from the orphanage. Along the way, Lyra will meet a friendly witch (Eva Green), a great armored polar bear (voiced by Ian McKellan), a helpful aeronaut (Sam Elliot), and tribes of strange warriors. Her path leads her to a strange laboratory in the Far North, run by the Magisterium, where she will have a fateful confrontation with Mrs. Coulter.

The storyline is epic, on the scale of ""The Lord of the Rings"". The superb special effects make possible the fascinating landscapes of London and the Far North; battle scenes involving Tartar warriors, polar bears, and witches; and the seamless interaction between humans and their daemons. However, the movie never gets around to explaining its own confusing theology or the backgrounds of the principal players. Worse, the movie ends abruptly, without resolving any of the major plot elements. The viewer can only assume that one or more sequels are intended.

""The Golden Compass"" is recommended as an entertaining visual feast only to those who have the patience to wait for the necesary sequel or sequels that will finish the story, left seriously incomplete at the end of this movie.",1215907200,,2771,4.825263157894737

1600457,4,B00005JPNY,"Not having read the book, I found the film quite enjoyable and on a conceptual level perhaps even profound. The idea of a Socratic personal daimon in an animal form was deep (reminding one of the Mexican folk idea of the 'nagual', or animal soul each person is supposed to have) and impeccably executed. As far as i am concerned, however, the movie is really about special effects - the weasel, the golden monkey, the jackrabbit, birds, cats etc were supercool. Also, the polar bears were magnificent, amazingly well done - their walk, their roars (grizzly-like, actually), Iorgen's run - all this was really very professional.

On the other hand,  the cossacks and ""Samoyeds"" were unconvincing, i had no idea where they came from, why they supported the ""Magisterium"" etc. Ditto for the Gypsies.

The script was a bit superficial but it did get the point across - of a being a conspiracy to deprive people of their (our) animal nature, our animal soul. Sounds familiar.

what I do dislike and even resent in the film is the blatantly unfinished end, which leaves the watcher hanging in the air. They could 've pulled this one off much more elegantly. The main actresses (Dakota & Kidman)  did a pretty good job, much better than the men which were either unconvincing or simply too generic.
Anyway, pretty good film overall, much better than the Narnia flop.",1215820800,,1359,4.7905982905982905

The movie compressed that convoluted and hugely symbolic book into a 2 and a half hour movie. I can think of some more idiotic moves but not many. To someone who likes the book this movie is like taking the Bible (and every single story and backstory in it) and compressing it into a 1 or 2 hour movie. It's just not a good idea.

1600459,5,B00005JPNY,"If you liked *Chronicles of Narnia* and *Stardust*, then you'll like *Golden Compass*.  The story takes place in an alternate universe where humans' souls are visible.  Their accompanied souls are daemons, taking the form of an animals.  The forms changes when humans are children but eventually chose a final form as humans mature.

Lyra, an orphan, is intriqued by the mysteries surrounding by her uncle's secretive mission to locate the Dust.  Meanwhile, she's given a alethiometer, a golden compass, which can reveal truths.

While following her uncle, she encounters Mrs. Coulter, who offers Lyra a job as a personal assistant.  However, things are not what they seemed to be.  When Lyra learns that one of her friends has been kidnapped for a deadly experiement, Lyra has no choice but to escape and rescue her friend.

On her rescue mission, Lyra encounters and befriends some interesting characters, such as Serafina, a witch queen and Lorek Byrnison, a disgraced king of the armored polar bears.  When trouble arises when rescuing her friend and other children, Lyra's new friends come to the rescue.

Overall, good story and wonderful special effects.  The ending isn't quite complete, which leads you to believe that there will be a sequel.

1600460,4,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass is a very ambitious film based on a very ambitious book.  If you haven't read the book, and you liked this movie, you must go read the book.  That said, this film really did seem rushed and a lot of the appealing aspects of the book are left out.  However, most of what they changed made sense to me (like switching the order of events at Svalbard and Bolvangar) and made the flow of the movie work better.

My main problem with this movie is the same one I had with David Lynch's Dune:  You really wouldn't know what's going on unless you've read the book.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but my wife, who was watching it with me, had just finished the trilogy and she was able to explain a lot of what I was seeing - much like when I watch Dune with someone who hasn't read the book.

So in the end, The Golden Compass suffers from being too complex and fast-paced in order to do justice to the book it's based on.  Yes, I liked the movie a lot (enough to buy it for my library), and it inspired me to read the fantastic novels, but those who haven't read the book may be confused by what they're seeing.

1600531,3,B00005JPNY,"In some (nearly) parallel universe, things are quite different.  Human beings walk alongside their ""demons"", almost tangible avatars of their souls.  The war between church and academia (irrational faith and enlightened reason) has virtually been lost to the ""Magisterium"", a workable stand-in for organized religion.  The only hope for freedom is an understanding of ""dust"", some quasi-cosmic substance that flows into humans through their demons.  The Magisterium sees Dust as a threat to their rule (if only because it's not found in their scriptures, and nothing that powerful can remain outside their control) and plans both covertly and in the open to cut man off from it.

Lyra Belacqua, a precocious 12 year older living in some otherworldly version of Oxford, finds herself at the crossroads of this conflict.  Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) mounts an expedition to the North where the Aurora Borealis reveals a cascade of Dust flowing to a man through his demon.  Marissa Coulter (Nicole Kidman in seduction-overdrive), an agent of The Magisterium, takes an extreme interest in Lyra and offers to take her on an expedition North.  Before leaving (and once Coulter's odiousness has clearly emerged from her charming demeanor) the master of her school gives her the last remaining Alethiometer - the Golden Compass - an instrument which she doesn't understand.  The master's commands are simple - keep it secret, keep it safe.  It is only after Coulter virtually imprisons Lyra in her London home (looking like Kensington, with carriages drawn by lightning instead of horses) that Lyra realizes that something is very wrong.  Snooping around, Lyra finds evidence linking Coulter with the systematic kidnapping of children (including at least one of her friends) and escapes with her Alethiometer.  Hooking up with Gyptians (tough but honorable sea-going nomads) in search of their own lost children, Lyra heads North.

In her search for her missing friend, Lyra will encounter Iorek Byrnison (I know I couldn't have spelled that right - just think of a polar bear with battle armor and the voice of Ian Mckellen) a witch named Serrafina Pekkala (let's just put spell-check aside, this is a parallel universe) played by Eva Green, an ""aeronaut"" from Texas (and therefore played by Sam Elliot) and various other characters.  Her search will bring her to a remote polar research station run by the Magisterium where cruel experiments are conducted on children to separate them from their demons, their personal conduits for Dust.

NOW THAT I'VE WAXED ON THE STORY...
There's a lot of material underlying the ""Dark Materials"" trilogy, of which GC is the 1st part.  Unfortunately, none of it actually works its way into the narrative of this movie.  The script excised much of the story's barb against organized religion, reducing the Magisterium to a bunch of generic odious characters in funny clothes plotting something, and ever extending their authority.  It's hard to imagine how well the flick would have done were its script larded down with polemic of any kind (let alone anti-religious), but the movie fails because it fails to become a story about anything.  It would be easy for the fans to blame Hollywood for taking god out of the picture (as ironic a charge that is for the left) but fantasy stories have always been based on characters who were analogs for those of real life (or acknowledged as such in real life), and The Magisterium of the books could have been replaced with one just as potent without condescending to religious viewers.  I mean, this is a parallel universe - it's all about finding different versions of what we already recognize.

Unfortunately, rather than playing shell-games with its symbols, GC decides not to play anything at all.  The Magisterium never becomes more than generic baddies (and because they don't do much at all, its hard to envision them as villains at all); there's a war between polar bears that will see Iorek returned to the throne - even though the bears as a whole never become a factor in the story once that happens; there are witches and an evil army of cossak-looking guys, scientists and ofcourse Mrs. Coulter.  There's plenty of CGI designed to make us think that things are happening, and the story includes a northbound journey to make it seem like the story is going somewhere when it doesn't.  The movie climaxes on a pitched battle between the cossak-looking guys on one side and witches, gyptians and Iorek on the other - it's old stuff to anybody who sat through Narnia and at least 2 of the Rings movies, and since it's shot at night, it's harder to see what's going on.  Though the movie preserves at least some of the book's rich material, the narrative sloppily integrates it into the story - using embarrassingly obvious expository dialog and bombarding Lyra with a number of characters who exist if only to show/tell Lyra what to do next.  Virtually every plot element in the story is told to us rather than discovered by Lyra.  (The Alethiometer is supposed to tell truth, but it to becomes a convenient plot device, a GPS for Lyra to navigate the story's otherwise unnavigable byways.)

There's actually a moment in GC that promises what the rest of the movie fails to deliver.  Lyra, having been chased to the doors of her College-home by a band of Gyptian children, warns them back.  She threatens them with unspeakable horrors should they cross the gates of the school.  The gyptian boy isn't one to suffer threats easily, so he and Lyra engage in duel of wits that ends with the combatants cheerily scheduling a later time to resume their war.  The scene embodies everything that the rest of the movie doesn't: a horrible fate, an unceasing belief (or unceasing refusal to believe) in it, and the unique capacity of children to create a great story, live it and know its limits.",1214697600,3,5879,4.931034482758621

I also found the fights between the bears and the other animals to be quite violent, as was the scene where Coulter slapped her daemon so hard he flew across the room. I realize children are exposed to far more violence than this in films today, but I think it warrants comment. The acting was decent, but not a stretch for any of the performers involved.

Consequently, with it fresh in my mind, I was able to see the many plot differences in the film. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that anyone could work out what was going on in the film. Many of the concepts of the book simply did not translate or come out in the film at all. Instead, the film was a simple, if a bit odd, fantasy romp with excellent CGI. The darkness, depth and plot of the book was completely lost. As eye candy and as children's fantasy, it was just passable.",1213747200,3,574,4.275229357798165

The story did seem rushed.  I felt like I was missing a lot information, as the movie fails to establish certain mythos before we are throw kicking and screaming into the major plot points.  For this, it looses a star.

Protip: Rent this before you buy it.

As an aside, try to pay little attention to the tin-foil hat psychos that want to imply metaphors and similes that simply are not there.  I find it endlessly amusing that these people will imply almost anything (though they like to attach politics and religion to EVERYTHING to improve shock value) to simple fantasy films, yet will fail to see the blatant similes of films like The Wizard of OZ.

1600663,5,B00005JPNY,"I read the negative reviews before I saw the movie.  My husband said it was good so I decided to check it out for myself (a free thinking adult).

Well, I enjoyed it & saw no anti religion, anti god or anti christian agenda at all.  It does encourage free thinking, so in that sense,  I guess it would be viewed as dangerous by those who don't like to question their religious dogma or have it questioned by others, especially if they are in the business of selling you ""salvation"".  I got a chuckle out of the reviewer who claimed Golden Compass was ""brainwashing"" for kids, as it is just the opposite.

As for comments comparing it to Narnia, I think it's silly.  Narnia is a repackaging of the christian mythology with 1) the lion playing Jesus & being tortured, killed & coming back to life, 2) the ""Judas"" brother betraying the ""good"" guys, 3) the silly lies about witches being ""evil"" people.  Pretty transparent.

Golden Compass encourages compassion, free thinking, free will, right action (doing what is right) & fighting against evil.  It teaches kids that when bad adults tell them to do something wrong, it is absolutely ok to rebel. It was refreshing to see this movie breaking away from the typical Hollywood misrepresentation of witches being evil & bad.

Other than the one short battle scene, I enjoyed the story, the message, the visuals & the actors.",1213488000,6,1369,4.6625

My only concern for children, is the possible sequel. The series IS about killing god, it is actually explicitly stated in the books- those who deny it are staring at white and calling it black. You do not have to be a religious zealot to see it you just need half a brain. The anti religion whiff is already in this one, but very mild. If you yourself hate god this is definitely a series for you. If you don't, you can still enjoy the special effects. As long as you are a thinking adult, aware of the antireligious undercurrents and the God hating agenda (which Pullman admits freely) you can definitely use this movie to promote thinking. For young unsophisticated children who are yet incapable of multidimensional thought, the book is cunning brainwashing; this movie is just a little dip.",1213401600,3,964,4.482954545454546
1600666,3,B00005JPNY,"I saw this movie without reading any reviews or the book so I'll base my comments on what I saw. The use of CGI and real people was very well done. Especially riveting were the fights scenes. The one between the bears and the second between the ""security forces"" and the witches. In the bears fight scene, you could really visualize watching two huge polar bears fighting to the death.

Sometimes things occurred, that by the movie's ended, didn't make sense. One of those was while Lyra and the Sam Elliott character while in his flying machine, witches flew overhead. He said ""they're on their way to fight"". How did the witches know there was going to be a fight when the actual fight doesn't happen for quite a few scenes later?

The ending left a lot to be desired. There were things left ""open"" (that should have had closure) and you also got the distinct feeling ""there's going to be a follow-up movie"".

My recommendation is to see the movie, if for nothing else to see the great CGI. The interaction between the ""real"" people and the graphics/animation really captures you.",1213228800,,1082,4.625
1600667,2,B00005JPNY,"I've heard the rhetoric against this movie and Mr. Pullman's books, and as a religious person myself I was a bit concerned.  But we acquired this movie with a bunch of others at a PTA fundraiser so we watched it with the kids.  And while I think I can see where Mr. Pullman is going - he is an outspoken atheist and I'm told his series of books end with the children killing ""God"" - it seemed very toned down in this movie.  At any rate, such an idea isn't really developed in the movie and my kids didn't pick up on any anti-religion agenda.

As near as I could tell the story takes place in a parallel universe where people's souls appear as an animal companion (called a ""daemon,"" but pronounced ""demon"") which doesn't settle into a single form until the child becomes an adult.  A young orphan girl named Lyra lives at a university with her demon, Pan, which is usually in the form of a ferret.  She is given a Golden Compass, or alethiometer, which tells her truth, and she is a natural at using it.  There's also a government of sorts called the Magisterium, which we're told is trying to control everyone (and apparently kidnapping uncooperative children), and there's something about ""Dust"" which was a little vague - sort of a link between the parallel universes, I think.  There's a kingdom of polar bears, good witches, a bunch of pirates or gypsies called ""Gyptians,"" a wise cowboy who flies a blimp, and a bunch of evil Nazi or Communist-like bad guys.

The CG animation is done well enough (not as good as the Narnia movies, although parts are rather stunning) and the acting is fine, but the movie is just plain stupid.  I'm guessing that in order to tone down anti-religious sentiments from the book they've left out so much of the plot as to render the movie practically impotent - either that or the book is stupid as well, but I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt.  I agree with the theme of encouraging children (and grownups) to think for themselves, but that doesn't make it worthwhile.  But all the gushing reviews comparing it to ""The Lord of the Rings"" and other fantasy movies are ridiculous.  The plot was dull, characters aren't developed, the polar bears were cartoonish, the obvious cliff-hanging setup for a sequel(s) was annoying, and in the end it just wasn't entertaining.  I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because one of my kids liked it, but the others were bored stiff. (EDIT: Since then the one child who initially liked it has watched it again and changed her mind).

So, if you haven't seen it yet, forget about all the fearful cautions from the religious groups and the overenthusiastic giddiness of the anti-religious groups, and just skip it altogether.",1213142400,5,2704,4.592515592515593

1600669,1,B00005JPNY,"The series was great. I'm a complete atheist; but was raised by hardcore religious fanatics so I have to say I love anything that artfully attacks god and religion.

That being said - the books were great - they weren't really anti-theological so much as anti-Christian; but in fact what it did was bring the Christian religion into the realm of fiction where it belongs; brilliant.

The movie; though - was just, just terrible. Amazingly terrible. All of the interesting little nuances were leaving not so much a skeleton of a plot but rather assorted parts of a skeleton such as a femur, left shin, spine and foot all duct taped together incoherently.

Couple of examples - after diverting from the sequence of events in the book - using a thin bridge of ice over a huge, yawning canyon to separate two characters in order to 'merge' back into the original story. (i.e. the ice breaks after the first character (the one who belongs in the next scene) crosses) Give me a break.

Another example - when Nicole K (forget characters name) just RANDOMLY out of no where with no supporting conversation tells Lyra about the bear king's obsession. It's like - insulting the audience by making so, so sure that you are aware of this piece of information so you can see how smart Lyra is for making use of it later. It's a kids movie, not a developmentally disabled kids movie.

The one cool thing was the daemon's transformations; as far as effects went.

For character design - Iorek sucked; the uncle guy sucked (better if they had the magesterium leader guy play him (sauron)) . What was up with the bears armor? It's supposed to be utilitarian not all flowery and weird and crap (Iorek's) - actually Iofurs armor seems less ornate by comparison which is the opposite of the point.

Oh yeah - and the balloon guys jackrabbit was frickin' cool. He wasn't a bad character choice either...

Anyways - don't see this movie unless you are lame in which case you will probably like it. Read the books, though. Oh yes, read them read them.",1212796800,7,2029,4.616666666666666

As an example, the Gyptian (sp?) ship was a pretty accurate representation of an sailing ironclad of the late 19th century. They really went the distance when it comes to detail.

This story is so rich that the movie tries to cram too much into too short a time. I hope for a Director's version with additional scenes inserted and not appended to the end. Lastly, I hope New Line displays some spine and produces the sequels.

All of this is to destroy the belief in Idividualistic Capitalism so the All Powerful State can control the economy and the national thought process and Government takes the place of God...

How do persons submit reviews while being proud that they never saw the movie or read the book--and never intend to?  My family watched the movie with open minds to be entertained.  We were.
Having never heard of the books, I cannot compare the movie to the pages, but I thought the movie did an excellent job of telling the FIRST part of a trilogy.  I was happy to have my daughter watching the courageous young Lyra  as a role model.  My son and daughter each have the book now (a single volume, available from Amazon, UK), and I have learned how a misunderstanding led to ""the Golden Compass"" title.
If you are able to enjoy a fantasy epic without bringing your own baggage into it, then I recommend this movie as Part One of what looks like a fantastic tale.  The bonus features will impress you with the level of detail, inspiration, and authenticity that went into this production.",1212796800,5,1014,4.478260869565218
1600716,3,B00005JPNY,"This movie is based on a book, the first book of a trilogy.  I have never read any of these books, and have no intention to, so this review is purely of the movie itself, as a standalone piece of entertainment.

First of, contrary to what some other reviews have suggested, there is minimal resemblance between this movie and the LOTR, Narnia, and Harry Potter movies of recent release.  Unlike LOTR, this movie is more intellectual and the conflicts more subtle and nuanced.  For example, the relationships between the protagonists and antagonists seem more complicated, with more twists and turns.  And instead of a focus on magic like in the Potter movies, this story rests on a background of other wordly technology.  The dress, speech and personal manners seem of Victorian time, yet some of the technology seem all too futuristic.  Probably the biggest difference between the Golden Compass and other recent fantasy tales is the former's use of females as the chief protagonist and antagonist.

This movie features the most distinguished cast of actors and actresses of any fantasy movie with names such as Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Sam Elliot, Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen.  Only the main character is fairly unknown.  It seems this movie's producers decided to hire an all-star cast to help take some weight of the main actress.  Does it work?  Partly.  Kidman's character seems perfectly tailored for the actress's skills, while everyone else could have been replaced with unknowns and the film quality would have stayed the same.

Probably the biggest failing of the movie was the soundtrack, or the lack of one.  The main song comes at the ending credits and is quite forgettable.  And there are no grand schemes anywhere thru the movie; though this is appropriate as there are no grand scenes anywhere thru the movie, which is probably the next biggest failing.  Every fantasy movie deserves a climax, that emotional peak to wow and exhaust the audience.  There is none in this movie.

There are two aspects of this movie that is all too familiar for fans of fantasy movies.  First is the abundance of British accents; even the bear has a British accent.  Second is the characterization of dark-skinned people as evil.  The movie features two groups of ""bad guys"", Tartars and Samoyeds.  The former come across as ruthless mercenaries, and the latter come across as criminals; both sets are shown to be orientals.  Interesting that the only non-white characters in this movie are all bad guys.  The Gyptians, which are supposed to be ""good guys"" are all white.  They are modeled after gypsies of real life, even though many gypsies come from Southern and Eastern Europe, and often have darker skin hues.

So overall, this movie is worth the two hours to watch on DVD; though not worth the price of a movie ticket.",1212796800,,2843,4.893305439330544
1600717,1,B00005JPNY,This movie is all over the place.  If you haven't read the book you wouldn't know what was going on.  I recommend you pick up the book and let your imagination run wild.,1212710400,5,169,4.090909090909091
1600718,2,B00005JPNY,"First, the visual effects were pretty weak. Think ""Made for TV"" movie and thats about right.

Second, the story seems to stop and start. Very disjointed. You'll spend 15 minutes hiding in a cupboard listening to some drawn out monologue and then ""a miracle occurs"" and the heroine is in the next scene. There is little flow to the film, its almost like the scenes were their own episodes with only the thinnest transitions.

Third, talk about preachy. Big bad Magisterium controls everyone and everything and is harming children only opposed by the last ""light"" of the world, a college. Yeah, ok. I mean we all know that colleges are beacons of enlightenment, I mean the frat parties are BRILLIANT. Come on, I'd like my indoctrination to have a modicum of sanity.

Bottomline. This is one movie the kids will yawn at and parents will roll their eyes through. Skip it.",1212710400,,867,4.728476821192053
1600719,3,B00005JPNY,"The positive is that it truly is perfectly casted, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Ian McKellen as the voice of Iroek, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, and my favorite: Sam Elliot as Lee Scoresby; and the ongoing cast of A-list actors perfectly fit for their roles in Golden Compass. Every actor in this movie seemed to have given it their all, and in my opinion couldn't have been better casted for their roles.

The soundtrack, although not as epic and sweeping as Lord of the Rings, seemed to carry an optimistic, mystic, and fantastical if not a bit underwhelming tune throughout the movie. Especially during the large battle scene at the end of the movie.

Also, although not the best I've seen, the CGI is remarkable. Almost seamless; the deamons are extremely believable and very, very charming. The first scene, by which the camera pans through a curtain of dust into another universe, was very well done and complimented the feel and premise of the story. The frantic scenes of people being killed and their daemons bursting into golden dust- albeit different from the book's ""fading away"" approach- added greatly to the excitement and really gave a unique feel to the battle scenes, even if it does look a little too much like the 'Blade' series. The world is displayed spectacularly as Lyra and Roger walk along Oxford's rooftops, giving the truely beautiful and awe-inspiring feel that the books gave.

**SPOILERS**

Another thing I liked, that I never really felt in the book, was Mrs. Coulter's seemingly genuine compassion for Lyra. In the novel, it came across that Coulter truly could care less about Lyra's well-being and simply pretended to care for the sake of the Magisterium's wellfare. In the book, I felt as though Coulter simply was the Magisterium, as it is said many times. However, in the movie she is presented as a puppet used by the Magisterium against her own better understanding, something I feel is much more spot-on about organized religion than her merely being a fanatic control freak. I could've missed this in the book, it might've been so subtle I couldn't recognize it; either way I feel it was a good addition to the movie.

However, the negative is overwhelming, and although it doesn't completely destroy the movie, it takes it down from the pedastal of epics that the story really deserves to be on. The completely uninspired direction from Weitz; it seems as though he had a huge project and absolutely no idea where to go with it. Also the relentlessly butchered storyline to fit the time frame. Although it's understandable that not everything could be included in the story, they certainly could've been less ""liberal"" with it. I believe it was ""dumbed down"" to be made more understandable, as many of the main plot points seemed to have been easier to explain than in the book.

They all but completely severe the anti-religious aspects of the story, simply sticking to saying ""Bad people"" and ""Organization"" rather than ""Catholic"" and ""Chuch"" one too many times, relieving its onslaught on organized religion to a near halt. When viewing the movie, it seems to get along fine without it, though it truely distracts from what the novel tried to say about organized religion's control over 'truth'. The Magisterium's ""The Fall of Man"" view on Dust is rather made into ""Bad people rebelled"" and the entire section quoting the bible- while giving it a parallel universe twist with daemons- is excluded completely. Whether this was a genuine attempt to make the movie more likeable, and therefore more popular and a bigger box office; or it was just a twist in the wind avoiding relentless hate-mail from fanatics drawing ill-attention to New Line; or if they're saving the ""heavy"" things for the sequels is beyond me, but still disappointing either way, and the depth of the story takes many hits from it.

Some awkward and nonsensical moments also can be seen in various scenes. For one: when Lyra first mets Iroek, she uses the compass and says ""I know where the armor is"" followed by Iroek blurting out a full-on contract with Lyra without any form of ""If you take me to it"" as was very prominent in the book, and topped off with Iroek storming down town- with Lyra following- and somehow finding his armor. I really don't know what the gimmick here was, if Iroek already knew where his armor was but didn't get it because he had no reason to; if somehow Lyra guided him to his armor in an off-screen way; or any other reason. Either way it seemed very choppy, rushed and confusing, incoherent opposed to the novel's silky-smooth fluidity.

The section of the novel where Lyra interacts and grows fond of Gyptians, even starting to believe that she is one as well, building a loyal, loveable and even political enviroment, is completely removed. Time and budgets are a main factor, obviously, but to me this section gave so much heart and feeling to the novel, so much purpose in community and loyalty. The debate whether or not to raid the North to rescue the children, the rule that no women were to join the excursion (Ma Costa, in the movie, is in the final battle), and so fourth is completely removed.

The story of Billy becoming ghastly after his daemon is removed is reduced greatly- making almost 2 chapters of discussion and suspense into a 5 minute scene, albeit an emotional and powerful one at that. Nearly every single majestic view of the Aurora is removed, in fact the ""Northern Lights"" aren't seen between Lord Asriel's presentation at Oxford and the final scene of the movie.

The entire section in which Roger and Lyra explore Oxford, including the catacombs and tombs undergound is also removed. Really the list of removed material is almost uncountable: Lyra's history with Asriel, the Oxford Master's history with Asriel and the Magisterium, the story of why Asriel and Coulter seperated (leading to the story of Lyra's nanny), the depth of the ""gang wars"" between Jordan, Oxford and Gyptians; Lyra's experience in the Experimental building, Lyra's experience in the prison of Bears, Iroek and Iofur's history, the Female Bear, the list really is endless.

The last thing I'll mention and gripe about: that ending. Completely removing the entire section when Asriel and Coulter are reunited, when Asriel cuts off roger's daemon and establishes the bridge between worlds, the whole chapter of Asriel explaining charged particals and its relation to Creationism and Parallel Univeres, the discussion between Serafina Pekkala and Lyra on Scoresby's flying machine, and so much more plot twists and emotional changes. You really can tell they rushed it, and either the abruptedly blatant ending is a ploy to get a bigger audience for The Subtle Knife (should it indeed be made) or simply a rush to get it into theaters.

The redeeming factor in this movie is what they got right, they really got right. Especially the Daemons and characters to name a few; in fact the characters would've been almost perfect had it not been for the complete absence of character development and a lack of true backround for any of them.

Overall a decent if not very disappointing movie. Certainly enjoyable, but not especially for ""hardcore"" fans of the novel.",1212710400,2,7240,4.866883116883117
1600720,2,B00005JPNY,"And to think there's supposed to be 2 more of these movies. I have to agree with other reviewers who found that character development was out of touch here and pretty much void throughout the entire movie. New characters appear out of the blue and nothing is known about them but they end up being an integral part of the story which really cheats the viewer. It's also too fast paced at times to know what is going on or what the story is actually about. I think there is a rush in Hollywood to make Fantasy adaptations yet they have no idea how to keep it equal to the novel or the series. Hollywood is too anxious to make the next series of LOTR's or Harry Potter's that they are hardly putting any work into the storylines or CGI to make it interesting at all. This movie is full of so many gaps that it does the novels extreme injustice. A fantasy-based movie like this should not be under 2 hours if you're trying to encompass a huge story as The Golden Compass is supposed to be. And if it was going to be over 2 hours, at least make it more interesting.

1600725,1,B00005JPNY,"Is there a zero star rating?  This is one movie that should never have been made.  The author of the book has proudly declared his hatred for the Chronicles of Narnia series and its author C.S. Lewis and has stated his series is to be an anti-Narnia.  While the movie may have tried to disguise the open attack on the church by use of the name ""magisterium,"" the sole purpose of both the book and movie is to discredit the Christian faith and malign God.  In the final book (and I assume also the movie based on it if one is made) God is killed and the church destroyed.  Aren't there enough dark works that exalt evil without making one with animal characters and CGI animation to lure children to it, thinking they will see a wholesome Narnia style movie, only to assalt the principles and morals on which Narnia is based?  If you don't believe in or approve of God, uplifting faith and organized churches, that is indeed your right.

This cinematic catastrophe is loaded with story-line gaps, an endless parade of lifeless characters, and general plotlessness. As a viewing experience, it is only mildly endurable for the special effects. What a cast! But it doesn't help. What a budget! But this movie makes Kevin Kostner's Water World look like a work of genius by comparison for all of the criticism it received in view of its titanic price-tag.

I found myself nodding off and the movie made as much sense half awake as it did with my initial full attention. What a cinematic disaster. Anybody got a golden plot compass?",1212364800,5,866,4.924657534246576

I just picked up the bluray disc and we watched it over the weekend. If you are into fantasy films or your kids are it's a must rent or own. Forget about the anti-christian political stuff, there was no inkling of this in the film at all. It was a high quality film on the same par as some of the Potter movies. It is a step above the first installement of the Narnia movies. I attribute this to the higher quality of acting and editing.

You know a movie is a keeper when your 12 and 14 year old kids want to watch it again after the first viewing. My only gripe is with the ending. As others have said it does not do enough to tie everthing together. I realize that their intent was to draw you into a sequal, but there was no sequel in production and there are no definite plans for one as of today due to poor domestic revenue. All that said it is still worth the price of a rental or a purchase for all but the last 5 minutes.

1600837,5,B00005JPNY,"This was the best fantasy movie to come along in years. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but I found the movie incredibly enjoyable for the ""thinking"" person, and I'm now finding the books equally enjoyable.

To the avid fans who complain about the adaptation - I would point out that the objective of a movie is not the same as the objective of a book. Of course some of the complexities and characters have to be changed a bit, or else you'd have a 10-hour movie. Give it a break - this was a decent adaptation, and for those who don't want to read the books, the movie stands on its own.

And to the fundamentalists who complain about the ""demons"" in the movie...get an education. The concept of the Dmonic was actually popularized by a Christian psychologist, Rollo May, in a book that was inspired by Paul Tillich.

Also, before seeing the movie, I heard a lot about it being an ""atheist"" version of Narnia - it is nothing like Narnia, and the cosmology presented here, though complex, is a form of gnosticism, an early (possibly the earliest) form of Christianity. Get a brain, people. Everything outside your extremely narrow brand of right-wing theology is not ""atheism"" - there are a huge variety of spiritualities, consciousness movements, humanistic and transcendental belief systems, gnosticisms and agnosticisms, etc., which hold themselves to much higher moral standards than your fundamentalism.

I actually liked this better than most of the Harry Potter movies, and much better than Narnia or Lord of the Rings. For a movie with a fraction of the budget, this was incredible. The acting was superb, the special effects were superb, and this movie actually had something to say (if you pay attention and listen). Sure, the book explains things a bit better, but the movie definitely makes my Top 5 list for the year.",1212278400,8,1849,4.76875

Children are going missing and the young Lyra Belacqua is given a mysterious compass that may have the power to open the doorway to other worlds and collapse the power of the Magesterium.

For all intents and purposes the film is one big build up to Lyra meeting the bear Iorek Byrnison for a big bear fight. After that it quickly goes downhill, leaves the question of what `dust' is open and ends abruptly with a `to be continued...'

TGC does look really good and a lot of effort has gone into giving it high production values, however fans of the Dark Materials books are likely to sneer rather than reveal in it and for all its interesting moments there are an equal amount of dull ones.

However, it was intended to be included and New Line cut the movie horribly, trying to create a fast-paced kid-friendly movie with an uplifting ending. The movie is, however, very well-and-lovingly made, and very well acted. The bonus materials on this two-disc set show the most honest and interesting behind-the-scenes materials I have ever seen, showing how closely Philip Pullman worked with the cast and crew on this film and how much thought and attention to detail went into every aspect of it to make a lovely interpretation of Pullman's universe.

I watched this movie late last year when it came out and I loved it from the beginning to the end. I had seen a review where it was given thumbs down by both critics. I think I would give it a thumbs up without even thinking too hard about it.
The graphics were some of the best I've seen, the acting was a lil' more than average and they took out / rearranged many things. The movie without reading the books is awesome, but reading the books just makes the movie clearer. They missed one or two vital points from the book, including a death of a character that makes a whole chain of events happen.
Overall, this is amazing without the books and still pretty good with the books. Anyone who sees this movie should stop by their local book store and pick up the series. They won't let you put them down. ;3",1211155200,2,893,4.228070175438597
1600977,2,B00005JPNY,"""The Golden Compass"" tries very, very hard to appeal to an adult audience with clumsy attempts at moralization and championing freedom of thought, but it can't seem to get over it's own childish nature and become a movie worth watching.  Considering the stink made by religious groups, one would think this was a blatantly anti-religion film.  It is not.  Anyone who says so likely has not seen it and therefore should have no opinion on it.  What the ""The Golden Compass"" IS is an anti-establishment rebellion against authoratative theocracy based on suppression of dissenting opinions.  This, naturally, would make the Catholic Church nervous since they have fostered more bad will on this planet than Bush/Cheney, Kim Jong-Il, and Bin Ladin put together.  I've also heard that the film's villains, an organization known as The Magisterium, represents Catholicism.  Funny, The Magisterium never does anything in this film as blatantly evil as The Inquisition so if what they say is true, I'd say organized religion got off lightly.

I decided to set the record straight on this film after reading Roger Ebert's embarrassing gushings about it.  And I am myself a master of the gush so it takes a lot to embarrass me.  Let's just say he places it above&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>, AND&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000W4B8NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>] on the fantasy genre.  The man has committed his share of film atrocites, but this ranks even above his razing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange</a>&nbsp;on the ""you-get-paid-for-this?!"" scale of mainstream reviewer gaffes.

But first, the good.  The film looks great, has at least one great and surprisingly violent moment, and at least attempts to delve into deep metaphors that most fantasy films wouldn't even touch.  The daemons (pronouced like ""demons"" but spelled in the old english way that meant ""spirits"" before the meaning and spelling were corrupted) are a great device.  Each human's spirit accompanies them in the form of an animal which can change shape (like a child's mind and personality) during a person's formative years before settling on one form later in life.  That is where the good ends because ,unfortunately, the animals talk.  At least the heroine's does, and good god is he annoying.  Thus the fantastic metaphor is reduced to a yammering ferret most of the time that reminds you every minute or so that you are watching a children's movie.

Now the rest of the bad. The film's overall message is a good one, but the execution of the story is atrocious.  The dialogue is a constant irritation.  Original author Phillip Pullman obviously does not have the mastery of language that Tolkien, Lewis, and even Rowling displayed with such ease.  The fantasy masters create entire languages all their own that roll off the tongue and are fun to read and speak.  ""The Golden Compass"" throws words like ""alethiometer"", ""gobblers"", and ""dust"" around.  Why call the golden compass an alethiometer?  Obnoxious pseudo-intellectualism, the same type that forces a word like ""daemon"" -whose original meaning is dead, buried, and replaced- down our throats when any of a hundred others would have been wiser.  What is dust?  They don't really say and most of the characters don't know but apparently it connects worlds together and is talked about incessantly as if it is super-important. [snore] Are gobblers killer turkeys or something; I mean, we're supposed to be afraid of them, right?  No, they aren't turkeys and yes they are meant to sound menacing; but is ""gobblers"" really the scariest thing they could have called the Magisterium's child kidnapping squad?  Why not just call Gyptians gypsies?  Did Pullman just touch a globe and remove the first vowel in the name of the country he landed on to come up with that?  I could go on, but I'll stop now.  No, one more.  After hearing almost everbody talk in perfect king's english the whole movie I wasn't about to cheer for a little girl shouting ""he ain't nuthin'"" to her polar bear (oh, I'm sorry, ICE bear) friend about to fight for their lives like she was 50 Cent.  And can somebody tell me why there's a COWBOY in this movie?

Naturally, every character and group comes together suddenly with no premable for a big epic battle at the end.  Not really sure why most of the people were there, but I'll assume it was to fight evil.  And why is The Magisterium so evil?  Sure there's the power and all that, but Nicole Kidman's character seems to have no motive whatsoever.  She just scowls around the place trying to look evil with all her icy-hotness and then looks even more evil when she smiles.  Nice trick, but what's really in it for her?  The Compass scenes were cool the first few times, but then we're shown it again and again and again and I'm over it.  And what exactly is all this leading up to?  Tune in next time and hope it makes sense!

Obviously, this is a shot at a big money franchise, but it falls way short.  I am not that guy that hated the first LOTR film, rushed to the midnight showing of the second, hated it, and waited in line overnight to catch the third and am still talking about how much those movies sucked.  You get one shot with me and if you miss, I'm out.  This movie cribs from the best of them but falls far short of any attempt at a cohesive story, a believable world, likeable characters, or even any outstanding action scenes.  It is beyond ridiculous and I was embarrassed when my wife (a Potter fantatic) walked in on me watching it.  Seriously. The religious protesters need to sit the hell down and stop behaving like over-the-top villains if they want to stop being compared to them and Roger Ebert needs to get a real job. This is one project that is not worthy of anybody's attention.  The kids may enjoy it, but anybody intelligent enough to comprehend the depth this film tries so hard to achieve will likely be put off from this series permanently by the clumsy and amateurish execution and childish language.  Anyone who says otherwise is likely doing so to spite the aforementioned religious nuts.  I say there are plenty of ways to do that without stooping to defending a third rate B-movie in bloated big-budget clothing.  MST3K, where are you?

I did have to watch it twice to understand most of it. The ending was left wide open, but that is understood because their will be 2 more movies to follow. Nichole Kidman does a wonderful job as a villian, and it was very well thought out to not only capture adult's imagination but children's as well. The little girl who plays the title role does a excellant job as well. The Polar Bears, especially a particular fight scene involving them, add color to a sometimes slow movie.

Of course a 400 page novel can never really condense into a 2 hour movie successfully but in the case of this film, they should have hired a real writer and a non-American director to do it correctly. The ""writer/director"" responsible for this mess should never be allowed near a film set again. He was just not intelligent enough to comprehend and distill the material, so instead of an interesting and new work of art we get a lightening-paced mess of superficial action highlights. This is not so much a film as it is a poorly constructed (albeit very long) trailer for a much more complicated and rich story. It isn't that scenes have been removed or changed or seem missing somehow (which is expected in any book-to-film adaptation) but whole layers of thematic nuance and subtext and nowhere to be found. Shakespeare for kindergarteners. It is as if the producers and ""writer/director"" found a diamond and were not smart enough to even recognize what they held in their hands, passing it back and forth until all they had were a few grains of shiny sand that no longer held value or even together. Are there no intelligent people left in Hollywood? Surely someone must have seen the script or an early cut of the ""film"" and noticed that something was terribly wrong.

The characters were two-dimensional, and we never really get a feeling of WHY they do what they do.

The evil is vaguely defined, but not really understood.

The bit about a person's soul accompanying that person as an animal sidekick was intriguing, but wasn't exploited, although it was hinted that it was a central issue in the conflict, we were never told why.

1600986,5,B00005JPNY,"Not knowing anything about `The Golden Compass' nor the book `Northern Lights' by Philip Pullman upon which this film is based, I must say I was not only pleasantly surprised, but amazed by what I saw and heard on my initial viewing. The visuals are astounding and the storyline is original, highly controversial (at least in the mind of some religious groups) and abnormally complex.

Maybe even more amazing to me than how good this film is, was the high volume of criticism and low ratings it has compiled from Amazon reviewers. I can discern only three possible reasons for this unlikely occurrence;

1- It's to be expected if the film diverges from the book, something purist cannot tolerant. (Again, not having read the book in question I cannot comment on its faithfulness to the source material).

2- It might be a case of not appreciating the complexity of the story. You can't just jump into this film and immediately know what's going on. You have to exert a little effort and brain power to work your way into this alternate universe before settling down for the ride.

3- However I'm certain that the biggest body of complaints come from Christian factions that don't like their belief system challenged in any form. The portrayal of an evil ruling body known as the Magisterium may hit a little too close to home for some Catholics and those within the Protestant camp will most certainly be bothered by seeing every human accompanied by what appears to be an animal familiar referred to as a daemon* (no it's not a demon, think of the Hellenistic concept of the daemonic).

*These animals are part of the individual. In this imaginary world the soul is separated from the body and exists as a companion creature that accompanies the individual throughout life.

If that wasn't enough to cause some of the faithful to begin beating their war drums and rattling their sabres it doesn't help to see a heroine who's furry companion is named Pan (short for Pantalaimon), an alluring Queen of the Witches with the angelic sounding name Serafina (i.e.: Seraphim) who fights with the ""good guys"", and the heroine's courageous Uncle, Lord Asriel who's name is all too similar to that of the fallen angel Azriel, long  associated with the Devil.

These religious/mythological cross-references don't stop here. I noticed a couple borrowed from Norse mythology as well. There's Lorek Byrnison ( possibly referring to Loki, the trickster God) and the immense warrior, polar bear Ragnar Sturlusson could be a subtle reference to Ragnarok, the Nordic version of the Apocalypse.

Of course there's always the possibility that someone simply doesn't like the film for reasons I've yet to comprehend, but I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy such an imaginative, allegorical, fantasy adventure.

1601030,2,B00005JPNY,"It seems like anytime a movie becomes embroiled in some form of controversy regarding its content, actors, or whatever the case may be, the controversy surrounding the picture seems to have the opposite effect from what was initially intended by those opposing whatever it was that had caused the uproar. The reason for this is because the controversy catches people's attention and causes some amount of interest to be generated due to the public's curiosity about what is so controversial in the film; so instead of turning people away from the movie as intended, the controversy ends up driving many people towards it. Now, this is generally the case for many of the controversial films that Hollywood releases; however, sometimes this is not the case and the controversy actually serves the purposes of those that were upset by the film. The latter just so happened to be the result of the massive controversy surrounding the recent fantasy release of Philip Pullman's novel ""Northern Lights"" called ""The Golden Compass"" starring Nicole Kidman (""The Invasion""), Daniel Craig (""007: Casino Royale""), and newcomer Dakota Blue Richards.

""The Golden Compass"" is the story of a parallel world of fantasy and wonder, where a young girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is destined to hold the fate of the entire universe in her hands, as a powerful gift known as the Golden Compass is given to her to protect. As she begins to use the Compass more and more, Lyra discovers that her world and other world's beyond her own are being threatened by a dangerous woman known as Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). With the aid of a heroic man named Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and a misfit group of allies that includes talking polar bears, Lyra begins her quest to save her world and the entire universe before it's too late.

I must admit that for me the controversy surrounding ""The Golden Compass"" did get my attention, and it did keep me from wanting to see the movie in theaters at least; however, I did still want to see it, if for no other reason than to see for myself if the controversy held any merit. If you are not aware of what the controversy surrounding this movie entailed, then I will enlighten you. Apparently when author Philip Pullman wrote his series of novels that comprise the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, he had one agenda in mind which was to attack Christianity, and make our benevolent and loving God into a being of corruption and oppression. Because of this agenda, which from what I've heard is significantly more prominent in the novels than in the movie adaptation, many religious groups opposed the film's release. In a rare turn of events the uproar surrounding a Hollywood film actually resulted in significantly diminished box office returns here in the states from what had been expected; however, overseas the box office was much more successful but the outcry was far less over there. Regarding the controversy, upon viewing the movie I can see in a few places where the story could be construed as being anti-Christian or anti-religion, but the story for the most part must have been so diluted from what was in the original novels, that I can't really see why the film caused as massive of an uproar. My guess is that most of the opposition was aimed at the books rather than the film, because what was contained in the film would have come off as nothing but typical fantasy movie content had no one pointed out the intent to be anti-Christian. Because if you really think about it, most fantasy movies feature elements that could be construed as anti-Christian or anti-religion, a prime example occurs in ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" when Obi-Wan is fighting Anakin. In the scene, Obi-Wan says something along the lines of `Only a Sith speaks in absolutes', well as a Christian I speak in absolutes when I say that Jesus is the only way, so by that statement I could take what Obi-Wan was saying as a slap in the face to my religion, but I don't because I know it is a fantasy film and therefore I view it as nothing more than a work of fiction with no real bearing on the real world or my faith.

That's enough talk about the controversy surrounding the film, now it's time to focus on what I actually thought about the movie in general. I've got to say that as a fantasy film, ""The Golden Compass"" is not among the best entries into the genre, especially when compared to the far more superior films that have come before it in the forms of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"". The pace in this film is incredibly slow, for the most part I was bored watching this movie, and was almost tempted to quit watching several times throughout the two hour running time. Working in the film's favor were the very entertaining fight scenes featuring the polar bears, which coincidentally would turn up around the time I would lose so much interest in the film that I was preparing to turn it off, but I wouldn't thanks to those scenes. Those fight scenes were incredible from the impressive CGI effects employed to create the armored polar bears, to the hard-hitting action contained within the scene, everything about those scenes were terrific. As entertaining as those fight scenes were, the brutality of the scenes actually pushed the movie into a much darker tone than I expected. Even without the fight scenes the movie's tone felt a bit darker than most fantasy movies, but when you add those scenes to the mix the tone really takes a turn for the dark, and most likely caused many parents to not give the movie much repeat business, if they gave it any business at all after word of mouth got out regarding the darker subject matter of the movie.

The actors in this movie were all very talented A-listers, but some of them seemed a bit wasted in their roles. Nicole Kidman seemed to be genuinely enjoying her scene chewing villainous turn as Mrs. Coulter, a role that was quite a bit different from anything we've seen from her previously in her career. Daniel Craig was good as Lord Asriel, but his role felt more like a cameo than an actual lead role in the film, which surprised me due to the marketing for the film making him seem like a major player in this movie. Most likely his character would see more screen time in the sequels that may or may not occur due to the lacking box office here in the states. Dakota Blue Richards was good as the young heroine, Lyra, although I sometimes felt she was a bit on the annoying side, but for a newcomer she did a good job handling such a large role that required a lot of imagination especially in the scenes where she is supposed to be interacting with her soul (as personified by various animals) or with talking bears. The voice-over actors that personified the various animals featured throughout the film were very good, and were actually the biggest highlights among the cast. From talented veterans Sir Ian McKellan (`Lord of the Rings' trilogy), Ian McShane (""We Are Marshall""), and Kathy Bates (""American Outlaws"") to newcomer Freddie Highmore (""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), the animals were given some of the best voices in Hollywood with which to speak and the movie definitely benefited from their presence.

Overall, ""The Golden Compass"" was an extremely dull and boring entry into the generally entertaining fantasy genre. Boasting an incredible cast of actors and actresses, impressive visual effects, and very entertaining and hard-hitting fight scenes, ""The Golden Compass"" could have been among the best that fantasy had to offer; instead, the movie's poorly paced story drained it of any interest for me and left me wishing it would end sooner rather than later.

1601032,5,B00005JPNY,"As a viewer that hasn't read the book yet, I enjoyed this film very much.  So much so that I have already purchased the books so that I can get the full picture and continue the tale.  There are very few films that can match the quality and story of the novel they are based on.  So, it's important to keep expectations at a reasonable level.  Hundreds of pages do not shrink to less than 2 hours without losing something.  After speaking with some of my friends who read the book, I think they kept to the spirit of the story if not the letter.  Ironically, the film made far more money in Europe where the books are much more popular.  However, I wasn't watching this for life lessons or implied religious themes.  I wanted an interesting story, engaging characters and a fun adventure.  They delivered all three with some awesome special effects to boot!

The acting by the adults in the film was a little over the top, but fit with the grand adventure style of story-telling.  I completely bought Nicole Kidman as a snobby elitist who lives by ""the ends justify the means.""  I liked that good actors were placed even in bit roles (such as Sam Elliot), but the young star and the animals truly stole the show.  Lyra's character will appeal to fans of Hermione Granger and other smart little rebels.  I found myself cheering for her and her daemon.  The producers did a great job with the talking animals.  They blended with the story very well.  I never felt like they were zooming in on every animal every time - ""see, the animals are talking!""  This helped them feel more like characters in the movie than CGI stunts.  The dialog between Lyra and Pan was much like between any two good friends at that age.  And I loved the polar bear.  Who wouldn't get excited about a massive polar bear wearing armor!?  And voiced by Ian McKellan, priceless.  The subject matter is a little more grave than other movies of this genre.  The PG-13 rating was deserved, though much less so than movies like ""Alien vs Predator""!  The ending was a little abrupt, but seeing as it's based on the first book of a trilogy, I can't complain.  The filmakers didn't leave viewers with a killer cliffhanger, just in case the second film isn't made (which I truly hope it is).

This 2-disc DVD set is nice.  The extra features have a nice variety with your usual ""making of"" and behind the scenes stuff, but also a feature on the book and adaptation.  The packaging is standard, though I really like the outer sleeves that so many special editions come with these days.  There is no chapter insert - just an advertisement for the World Wildlife Fund and their promotion based on the film (adopt plush animals that represent endangered animals depicted in the film).  I'm happy I bought the 2-disc set.

Overall, I thought this was an entertaining film, with great special effects and a unique story.  I am glad I bought the DVD as I will certainly rewatch it.  Though I missed seeing this in the theatre, I would definitely see the sequel on the big screen.  Highly recommended to movie fans who haven't read the book and love a good adventure, and book fans who are open-minded about adaptations.",1210204800,9,3175,4.5396825396825395
1601033,5,B00005JPNY,"After being disappointed with several Blu-Ray titles and nearly regretting ever buying a player, this title excels with clarity that I demand. You really see the detail with the 1920x1080p resolution (on a 1920x1080 LCD). Every strand of hair and snow particle was absolutely clear (even when not in the center of the screen) and defeats the theatrical experience.

I saw this movie five times in theaters, but when I viewed this on Blu-Ray, I noticed two new details. They also perfectly cleaned up the 4-5 seconds of graininess of when Lyra enters the conference room at Jordan that was horrid in theaters. The only minor complaint I have is the added grain during the New Line golden company intro (the first 3 seconds). Any other grain during the film was absolutely minimum. That was surprising considering the numerous dark scenes.

The content of the movie itself is as amazing as it is charming. My girlfriend and I quote the movie all the time. We dread the possibility of the studios not doing the sequels. If they can complete the trilogy with the same quality as this one, I will hail it as the best trilogy ever.

1601034,2,B00005JPNY,"I had high hopes for THE GOLDEN COMPASS. The cast. The special effects. The story. It promised to be a dazzling cinematic experience. But the dazzle fell into Dudsville as Philip Pullman's magical novel got off to horrible start.

Before I get started, however, I think it's noteworthy to mention how ridiculous I found the claims surrounding the persecution of Christianity and The Church with regards to this film. You might be able to draw parallels between atheism and some of what was seen. But it could also represent Nazism. I know that Pullman WAS an atheist, but to say his books (and this film) represented that view is simply untrue. With the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>, Christianity has nothing to fear. Which is also why this review is tough for me.

I don't prescribe to any particular faith (you might even call me *gasp!* an atheist), but I don't go to movies in order to reinforce my beliefs. I go to be entertained. And, as I've said many times before, entertainment starts with a good (or great) script. And The Golden Compass' start was exceptionally unimpressive.

Jumping around like a child with A-D-D, The Golden Compass lacked perspective and a unified focus. The story is SUPPOSED to focus on Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl who's parentage is in question on a parallel world where ""beasts"" (see Animals) are part of ones being. They tag along beside you and are basically your soul (Oh my God! Christians Unite! *Whoops! There I go!*) Each person has a different animal/beast and young people's animals can change from one to another until they settle on a shape as they approach adulthood. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MNP2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>) is a scientist who goes against the grain of this parallel world and its leaders. He's found that ""dust"" from other worlds is flowing into theirs and he wants to discover what this dust is all about. But the powers that be want to stop him.

Enter Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet/dp/B00005JPCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet</a>), a dangerous player within a government that seeks to control everything, including Lyra. Marisa fraudulently befriends Lyra and takes her on a trip North, but not before Lyra receives a magical golden compass from a high councilor at the school where her uncle worked. The compass, it is said, is the last of its kind and can tell the truth and possibly the future.

Encounters with giant polar bears, flights in massive zeppelins, child prisons in the far-north, all culminate to form ... a disaster. And I don't mean a disaster for Lyra, but a disaster for the movie-watcher.

The canvas is simply too broad to be a coherent whole. Multiple side stories are mentioned and then never seen again or quickly wrapped up with little-to-no understanding. The script obviously was very choppy; perhaps&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>&nbsp;director Chris Weitz wasn't the best person to write it?

The only upside to the film is the incredible special effects. Most of the scenes were pure ga-ga for the eyes. Which means that The Golden Compass is more fluff than substance.

1601100,3,B00005JPNY,"""The Golden Compass"" has everything that would make a great fantasy film - great cast including Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and a fresh talent Dakota Blue Richards, plus great visual effects for which the film went on to win the Oscar. But one sad thing is the film itself doesn't have magic. It lacks a compelling story that would make its audiences willing to share the adventures with the heroine.

The film follows the story of the strong-minded young girl Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) living among Oxford scholars. While her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) travels to find out the truths of magical particles ""Dust,"" Lyra finds herself in the middle of the fierce struggle involving beautiful and commanding Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). And young Lyra is yet to know that the results of the battles may determine the fate of her world and ours too.

Set in the parallel universe where everyone has his/her own ""daemons,"" ""The Golden Compass"" centers on Lyra and her long journey to the North. The film has a variety of supporting characters including cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresby (Sam Shepherd) and great armoured polar bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen). Unfortunately, however, we have little time to know these characters. Gorgeous Eva Green appears as green-eyed witch Serafina Pekkala, but she has little to do in the story. And if you blink your eyes, you may miss Christopher Lee.

Sometimes ""The Golden Compass"" seems only providing the backgrounds for its subsequent films and has forgotten to tell its own story. Lyra remains attractive, and so is Mrs. Coulter, thanks to the superb performances from Richards and Kidman, but there is no character development. The concept of ""daemons"" is not fully developed and though the idea of ""Alethiometer"" or the Golden Compass is intriguing, the process of Lyra's decoding it could have been made more so.

""The Golden Compass"" is part of the trilogy written by Philip Pullman. I hear many complaints from the original book's fans who claim the book is much better. Not having read the book, I cannot say anything about it, but maybe director Chris Weitz is trying to please everyone. If so, he shouldn't. Perhaps he should have brought in his own vision and interpretation of Lyra and her journey. ""The Golden Compass"" is not a bad film at all.

Yes, this is still a fantasy film, but the emphasis is more on stylish creation of various animals (in the forms of 'daemons' that accompany children as their souls, morphing into various animal life at will) than tiresome explosions and flying beasties.

Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is clearly the star of this adventure that explores the possibility of other, parallel worlds whose interaction with the world as we know it is controlled by various groups of good guys and bad guys, all seeking the source of secrecy contained in a Golden Compass that can only be read by a single girl - Lyra, a poor child living in the presence of scholars.  Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) places the Golden Compass in Lyra's knowing hands and heads off to the far North to investigate the element that binds all life together - Dust. The tale is set in motion by the enigmatic Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who gains Lyra's confidence and offers to take her to the great North.  All manner of adventures occur on the journey - friends of Lyra's  are threatened to be separated from their various daemons in the cruel hands of the bad guys, Lyra's encounter with a witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), her assistance from a friendly astronaut (Sam Elliott) and an armored bear - and with all fantasies, good prevails - or does it?  Tune in for the very obvious next installment.

The pleasures are many, not the least of which are the voices and changing forms of the little animal daemons.  The cast is excellent and the whole movie sails with yet another beautiful musical score by Alexandre Desplat. It is a nice diversion, but you have to love fantasy.

1601103,3,B00005JPNY,"It is easy enough to say that ""the book was better than the movie"" -- since it is usually true that books offer a wealth of world that can only be hinted at in a couple of hours -- but this is a clear and disappointing case where the cliche fits.  Even films like the Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series don't really measure up to the original books they were based upon -- but in the case of those films, especially the Lord of the Rings series, the movies work on their own.  They establish their own world and it feels like a real world -- the characters seem to live there, and to understand it without constantly explaining it to each other.  In the case of the Golden Compass, unfortunately, that just isn't true.  Lyra explains things about their connection to her daemon Pan, and several characters give fairly long speeches explaining details to each other that they either would have known or that the filmmakers should have found more cinematic ways to make clear to the audience.

So far this sounds like I'm griping, and maybe I am -- I had high expectations for this film, since the books are brilliant and have a very strong visual component.  In the hands of someone like Peter Jackson, this could have been an amazing film.  As it stands it is merely competent -- the actors were chosen very well for their parts, but the script makes their dialogue a bit wooden, with every character announcing who they are and explaining their history every time someone new shows up.  Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter and the young woman who plays Lyra are the only characters who are really given enough space to come across as real.  The daemons who are so central to the book feel more like sidekick pets than external manifestations of the living soul of the characters.

On the other hand -- the film looks very good and for the most part the CGI components of the world mesh well with the realistic elements.  As a kind of living illustration to accompany the book after it has been read, the film works -- but not as a stand alone.",1209772800,8,2048,4.434666666666667
1601104,5,B00005JPNY,"A spectacular rendering of Philip Pullman's magnificent world(s), this is the closest that a movie has been able to match the imagery that the author's words created in my mind. The graphics and special effects were absolutely spectacular, to say the least, and the casting was perfect.

Sadly though, the main meaning of the book was stripped down to it's bare minimum and the complex story was chopped up and dumbed down. I give it 5 out of 5 stars simply for the experience of seeing what I imagined on the silver screen. I recommend this to any one who enjoys a good piece of eye candy every now and again, but I must compel anyone who seriously wants the intellectual experience of this tale to READ THE BOOK FIRST.

The film was shot with no regard to pacing at all. There are gratuitous shots of scenery just so the filmmakers could show off how wonderful their environments were. The whole thing even wraps up with a plot synopsis of the upcoming films, which runs something like:

""No.""

1601156,5,B00005JPNY,"On occasion producers, directors and screenwriters and all of the other hard working and dedicated people involved in an undertaking of this magnitude get it all right, and the result is a masterpiece of cinematography.  The story is a symbolic fantasy revolving around a young woman at the center of intrigue concerning the attempt by the murderous minions of the ""Magisterium"" to control all human thought and behaviour not only in this universe, but in ALL possible universes.  Strangely apropos vis a vis the current ""many universe"" theories of physicist David Deutsch and others, the story can be enjoyed by the young and by the young of heart and mind no matter of what physical age as the beautiful cinematography and music, and the well developed plot proceed at a suspenseful but well paced speed to the satisfying and exciting finale.

I must say the author's spiritual conceptions are wonderfully imaginative and can be considered to be a part of the growing modern movement which introduces far greater tolerance of different spiritual conceptions than would have ever been allowed in the world of even the recent past.

As far as the Religious overtones to some this is way overblown. Religion has been exploited for years in many different cultures and many say everyone else is wrong, and are not very excepting of other peoples religions or ideas and that what the movie tends to point out, more so in the book.

The movie previews have scenes that never happen in the movie, such as Mrs. Culturs and Lord Astrial (please don't mind the misspellings of the names) kissing. Those of us who have read the book will know that that scene is after where the theatrical version of the movie cuts off, avoiding the grisly ending...

1601160,4,B00005JPNY,"The movie is just good entertainment like ""Narnia"", ""Star Wars"", or ""The Lord of the Rings"". It has absolutely nothing to do with religion unless you consider people fighting for free will anti-religious, you belong to a meglo-maniac religion that likes to brainwash children, or you are a fan of the Spanish Inquisition. I suppose you could say a small part is religious since in their world their souls live in an animal known as a Daemon that keeps them company all their life. If either the animal or they are badly injured they both die and you see their dust disappear. But that is the only thing you can remotely say ties to religion. The rest the movie is about the adventure of a young girl and her daemon trying to get a golden compass to her father. Along the way they are hampered by a woman (rich and stylish Nicole Kidman) and her daemon (orange monkey with bad attitude) secretly working for the government, but Lyra is helped by her own daemon (switches between bird, feret, and cat), a group of people called Gyptians (Gypsies in steamships), a warrior polar bear (prince that should have been king but he lost a fight), a cowboy aeronaut (white haired and haggerd Sam Elliot that flies a balloon) and his daemon jack rabbit, and bow toting flying witches. The compass is a threat to the GOVERNMENT (Magesterium), not the CHURCH, since it tells the truth. The government is trying to suppress the truth since it has it's own spin on what it wants the truth to be. They have even gone to the extent of kidnapping children to brainwash them from childhood and separate them from their daemon. The ending is left up in the air like many trilogies. They talk of a war coming and Lyra's importance in the scheme of things at the end which sort of reminded me of the ""Empire Strikes Back"" ending. So even though there is some scary stuff, it is in fact something like a childrens fairy tale. If you didn't think Grimm's fairy tales were scary as a child, then you don't know the meaning of the word. Overall good casting, acting, directing, special effects, music and sets.

After screening the film in widescreen format on DVD, I felt the film doesn't do the books any justice at all. They rearranged some of plots and omitted lot of materials just for sake of compressing the novel into 109 minutes. They could have make it 180 minutes like ""Lord of the Rings"". I would say next to Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" this is the worst ever.

Those people who adapted the novel and made the film should never been allowed to ruin our experience. The author ought be ASHAMED for allowing his novels to be corrupted this way!

The only setback was that it kind of left you hanging for the sequel, but it's still worth it to watch despite the cliff hanger.

I think some of the content was more adult aimed, like the steam based engineering and analogies behind the government. But I'm sure kids would enjoy it anyway because of the animation.

However, I just couldn't accept the plotline, such as it was. It is, as I said above, too silly for words. Now I know that the books have come under considerable fire from the loony wing of the US evangelical community for the atheistic views that Mr. Pullman is said to have built into them and which, they said, he was trying to inculcate into children.

The worst performances, if that is possible, are by the child cast. Dakota Blue Richards is a very bad actor. Period.

This type of mess is typical of what Hollywood has been producing since the new millennium and is the main reason that less DVDs are sold and less people go to the cinema.

I also have read several articles on the making of The Golden Compass, so I was aware, very early on, that this film would end earlier than the book, and that the ending of THIS book would be the beginning of the NEXT movie.  Therefore, I was not as disappointed in the end of this film as many others apparently were.

IMHO, the casting of this film is dead on:  Dakota Blue Richards shines as the very determined, single minded Lyra, Daniel Craig is very good as the slightly touched, windmill tilting Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman is excellent as the true believer, yet evil Mrs. Coulter.  The entire supporting cast does a fine job as well.

The cinematography and the animation are both very well done. The settings are truly gorgeous.  Live action and animation blend well, but do have noticeable differences.  This contrast adds to the fantasy element of the film and helps to keep the viewer firmly entrenched in the world of the story.

Out of necessity, this movie hits the ground running and keeps up a fast pace.  The book is action-packed and filled with adventures; I imagine that there was much difficultly keeping the viewing time down to a reasonable length.  That being said, an audience who had not read the book could have a hard time keeping up.  I, at least, was able to fill in any gaps.

1601261,5,B00005JPNY,"Learning that ""The Golden Compass"" won the Oscar for Best Special Effects in 2008 should push the makers to produce its' sequels. As a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy story-telling, this was one book-to-movie adaptation I had waited for, and this was one rare instance where I found the film excelling the book in certain aspects.

One of the prime reasons I liked the book was because of its new take on Christianity and the Catholic Church in general. It didn't really say anything new, but the fact that a 'childrens' book could even address such topics was of course controversial to a certain degree. That said, the film does away with explicit reference to the Church, though everyone acts and behaves in a manner suited to the old guard of the Catholic Church. Believe me, the religious subtext in this movie is quite subtle - but if you pick up on certain lines and bits of dialogue, they did manage to slide a lot in here that I'm glad censors didn't pick up on it. For this alone, it breaks new ground.

Second, I am probably the only person around who doesn't think too highly of both the 'Harry Potter' and 'The Lord of the Rings' movie franchises. I never particularly cared for LOTR as a book, and the film versions seemed overwrought and way too pretentious for their own good. But thats just me. ""The Golden Compass"" is far superior to both those book series, in my opinion, and in a movie it soars past both of them. THIS is what a fantasy film should look like - challenging situations, amazing use of CGI (most of which was created by an obscure design firm in Mumbai, India of all places) and a spectacular acting job by the young leads.

The concept of a 'daemon' (pronounced 'demon') was always interesting to me from the start - but the wondrous use of imagery elevates this concept to a whole new level here - it really is something you've never seen on the screen before. Nicole Kidman's daemon is a golden monkey - one of the more luminous creatures in this film - and she is caught in a battle of love and hate with it.

The young actress who plays the lead should be especially commended. In her scenes as conniving wench who acts as instigator between the two great polar bears, she is superb. Eva Green plays a witch who believes in eternal love, and this beautiful French actress should have been given more screen time. However, its in its' scenes with Nicole Kidman that give this movie an edge of fear and suspense - she plays it straight, with no emotion in her eyes except calculation and scheming - and her scenes crackle with intensity.

""The Golden Compass"" is a big-screen movie, but no doubt it rightfully will find a place in your DVD library. It definitely deserves to. As an adult, the film spoke to me of so many mature, adult themes, leading me to believe that Pullman wrote these books with the world at large as his audience, not just children. In fact, the thought that your daemon can change its' shape repeatedly when you're young, but settles down into one form as you grow older - is a direct confirmation of social conditioning and personal self-worth and identification. The film challenges religious beliefs, but doesn't condemn religion. If you're worried about anti-Christian sentiments here, don't worry. Your children won't pick up on any of it - but they might come back to you with lots of questions. In my book, a great thing.

Films like this are one in a million. Granted not all 'special effects' films have a heart, but this one has a heart, mind and soul that is SO very different from other films of the genre. It truly is a very different, special movie, that not many people will 'get'. If you think of yourself as reasonably intelligent, and a little 'different' from people around you - well, then this is the movie for you.

Or that  the 2 battles Iorke  had to fight  where  so abrupt (as a friend put it  I have to win this fight, I WON)  and the importance of their armor.  Both way to short  and didn't give us enough time to learn &  love Iork for all his crustiness he dfevoted loved lyra. Lee  and  the witches are  supposed to be major  players in this and it's more like short cameos.  Yes in time I'll still get this movie but I  would've  improved it.  I  doubt the sequels will end up on the screen at all but please do read all 3 books Philip Pullman himself is a master storyteller  and I could happily say this series may even outshine Harry potter.",1203724800,8,1395,4.21455938697318
1601265,5,B00005JPNY,"For everyone who has disregarded these books or movie on the premise that it is anti-god needs to quit believing the he said she said BS. Yes in the books the current religious organization (the magisterium)is evil and trying to take over all the galaxies, but that does not mean their is no god, but rather the organized religion people have come to believe is evil, and that you should question your religion from time to time as not to fall short of gods graces. Phil pullman wrote his books against the narnia books, because the narnia books were way to biblical, and he wanted something that could make people look harder at things and be more creative.

Lets face it alot of religion right now is soo far from the original source, that we all need to question it, and that is what phil pullmans view was on it, and that is surprising because he was an atheist and you would have thought he would be preaching that, but he doesnt.

Bottom line read the books for yourself and you will be quite surprised how good of books they are much like the narnia books, and yes the harry potter series.",1203379200,9,1096,4.420792079207921
1601306,2,B00005JPNY,"I just want to something off the bat:  this is NOT the golden compass story you will find the book.  it is a pretty, highly flashy, children's fairy tale based on a truly inspiring story that the church hates to this day.  but i am not going to mention the church in this review, something completely backwards to a few years ago when the book came out; you wouldn't have seen any review without this crucial theological comparation.  no, because the movie has refused to add this element and, as the director states, will continue into the next movies (i only wonder in horror how those will be protrayed).

the characters, as others have mentioned, are a feeble outline of their true form.  i am not knocking the actor's skills.  no, i think they were actually perfect choices, included the young girl who played Lyra.  i have a series problem with the script.

EVERYTHING is different.  i am not just meaning that some thought-provoking conversations were omitted (there were, but that is to be excepted).  i am refering to the complete jig-saw puzzle of the order of events.  it seems that they took the three major events in the north and just mixed them up in an illogical order.

(spoiler)
for example: after the gypsies are attacked Lyra is brought (in the book) to the station Bolvanger because, logically, kids are valued there for experimental purposes and the hunters are paid in return.  However in the movie they bring her to the polar bears (for no reason that is explained), an event which Iroek just happens to the know exactly where she is and starts running there without the help of the gypies.

another major flaw of the movie is the lack of desperation in the characters.  in the book we see Lyra not only evolve, but express clear destress befitting a child in her position.  However in the movie she just kinda floats through the different events.  Also some scenes that i felt added to the danger level where omitted, like the finding of the separated daemons and the party at Miss Coulter's house.  These darker elements are completely wiped from the movie.

yes, one must admit that the special effects were stunning, and they did capture the style of Lyra's world.  But that doesn't lessen the blow of watching a movie that can't in any respect hold a candle to the books.  even though one must except different elements, this movie is pretty disappointing nevertheless. too much was omitted with not enough added.

i only recommed this movie to people who haven't read the book and even then not without much gusto.  ironically as always, this movie, as the book, does stick to the tradition of having a controversally existence.  the church still hate the book and thus still hate the movie due to the anti-theology message found in the books.  the fans of the book still love the book and thus still hate the movie due to the obvious plot holes and lack of real content.",1203206400,7,2901,4.650294695481336

1601308,1,B00005JPNY,"Let's start with my ""credentials"" (such as they are). I'm a very big fan of fantasy. I read Lord of the Rings as a teen in the mid-80's and loved the movies. I've read most of the existing fantasy stories and have seen the movies as well. I've studied Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell long and hard. As a leadership coach and consultant, I constantly try to support the underdeveloped metaphorical, symbolic approaches in people and organizations.

Okay, actually, I'm a PUSH-OVER when it comes to fantasy. I'm pretty much willing to give any fantasy story the benefit of the doubt.

So remember: I WANTED to like this movie.

Having said that, after watching this movie with my 12-year-old son, all I can say is, ""Huh?""  This movie barely made any sense. Characters remained under-developed (most of the adults). The heroine appeared simply to be a brat who got lucky. I'm a big fan of Nicole Kidman, but she seemed to overpower the role she was placed in ... and almost everyone she appeared in a scene with.

The stereotypical pseudo-archetypes were rampant in this one. Let's see, we've got ...

* evil, nasty mother figure.
* Uninvolved, unknown father figure.
* Evil, power-drunk priest-figures.
* Highly skilled warrior who gets dragged out of a drunken forced retirement to save the day (okay, he WAS a polar bear in this movie, but still ...)
* Overly young children precociously being heroes (what IS it with this culture's fixation on young children in hero roles? Anyone ever heard of an older teen-ager or young adult?)
* Precocious young children just ""knowing"" how to use a special magic item that other people had to spend years studying.
* An evil being who killed the king and usurped the throne. (okay, HE was a polar bear, TOO. But still ...)
* A kindly cowboy (I mean, ""aeronaut"").
* A sexy witch.
* Friendly pirates (excuse me, ""Gyptians."").
* Evil-yet-incompetent henchmen/scientists who seem to be unable to: (1) lock doors; (2) stop kids from getting away.

Yep. I think we covered them all here.

But, Lord, the star power. The aforementioned Kidman, Daniel Craig, Derek Jacobi, Sam Elliot, Ian McKellen, Kristen Scott Thomas, Jim Carter (an under-rated actor) and on and on. Talent mostly wasted in this movie.

During the ""nasty-woman-discloses-she-is-the-mother-of-the-young-heroine"" scene, I practically started laughing. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Luke, I am your father!""! One could probably superimpose the same scenes from both movies and find that they are pretty close to each other.

Some of the scenes were interesting. The neo-Art Deco props were interesting to look at, although the start of the movie seemed unclear whether it wanted to give a nod to Charles Dickens or Harry Potter.

Finally, the ending was lame. Extremely lame. When the movie finished, my 12-year-old son (who has read the books) simply sat staring at the screen with his jaw hanging open. He said that the book ended much better (as some other reviewers have also reported).

The books may have some real mythological material in them. Sometimes watching this movie was like trying to watch a  hour TV sitcom cover Romeo & Juliet - you know there's something of value there, but can quite seem to get to it.

If one was a cynic, one might wonder if all of the ""anti-God"" hoopla was created simply to salvage an ailing movie. One wonders. I'm going to give the books a read, just to see if there's anything to salvage after this atrocious movie.",1202688000,42,3459,4.820945945945946
1601309,4,B00005JPNY,"This movie does not show atheism in a favorable way.  It is merely based on a children's game.  Many such movies are being presented now with child actors from books and games written exclusively for children.  This one was colorful, but not deep in religious thought.  It was a little too loud for my sensitive ears, and so I decided I was not a child to live in fantasy as this definitely was.

(5) the romance between the girl and the fellow student she rescues portray the weak male relationship at a too-young age. (6) the armored bear is the best character, as far as strong character, clear motives, and noble standards. The humans seem stripped of those. Worst, the movie ends on a vague cliffhanger without resolving any tensions in the film satisfactorily. The children's rescue does not fill the need for closure to story. The dad is in imminent, undefined peril. Then screen goes black. A very unsatisfying ride. I did not feel empathy for anyone but the ferret and the bear. Phooey.",1200182400,14,1180,4.760975609756097

1601312,3,B00005JPNY,"I saw the movie of ""The Golden Compass"" before reading the book, though I had read news articles about the controversy over the making of it.  I wanted to like the film, being impressed with the story's highly original ideas, and by its strong young heroine as a champion for freedom of thought.  Yet, I was bothered by a number of things.

One was the all-too-obvious CGI effects, which made the alternate universe in which the story is set look less realistic and more cartoonish than it should have.  A more skilled director than Chris Weitz(Alfonso Cuaron for instance) could have worked wonders with some of the visual set pieces that the book provides.

Another was knowing that some of Weitz's deviations from Philip Pullman's novel were made, not for cinematic reasons, but as self-censorship.  His  attempt to make the story less offensive to religious groups, who were opposed to the novels, made the story less coherent, and the religious groups came out against the movie anyway.

The big surprise coming in a way that's very close to a very famous scene in a very famous film.  (The book reveals the surprise much earlier and in a different, though, admittedly, less cinematic way.)

Then there was the awkward non-ending, which left people in the audience I saw it with feeling cheated.  It also violated one of the prime directives of screenwriting:  show, don't tell.  We're told what happened to Lord Asriel instead of getting a climactic scene with him.

Not so, in Pullman's version, which I just finished reading.  The final scenes of the book are astounding, and they end with a cliffhanger more cinematic than anything in the movie.  By failing to incorporate these scenes into the film, and cutting off the story where he did, Weitz effectively cut his movie off from its daemon.  ""Just a little cut,"" one might say.  But this cut was fatal.",1199318400,5,1864,4.8081761006289305

1601315,4,B00005JPNY,"I viewed The Golden Compass completely unaware this might be the first in a series of three movies, fully incognizant of the three books the series is based upon, and supremely ignorant of the religious controversy swirling around the books. I did not notice anything controversial in the movie or anything thought-provoking for those looking for serious enlightenment. The flick is mostly fantasy with some pseudo-scientific gobbledygook thrown in to make you think you're seeing something of import.
 The first thing that puzzles nave viewers like myself is that everyone is accompanied by some kind of a personal animal, some of them very weird looking and all apparently capable of morphing into other creatures. These are individual daemons, and if one loses one's daemon, one can be radically altered by bad guys. There always seemed to be a lot of creatures underfoot. Does one have to take them out for a walk so they can do their business?
 The movie has well-known actors, often playing small roles. Sam Elliott plays a cowboy with an airship. Derek Jacobi, Tom Courtenay,  and Ian McShane are on hand as is Ian McKellen's voice as the good polar bear. Nicole Kidman is a baddie, and why she was chosen for this non-romantic role is a mystery. She has a particularly vile monkey daemon.
 At the beginning of the movie I thought I saw Radcliffe Camera, a round building that is part of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Other scenes seemed like Oxford and a Victorian-looking London. At the beginning with the gang of boys there was a distinctly Dickensian and Victorian feel to the story. And were they trying to remind us of the Harry Potter franchise? Jules Verne, anyone?
 The computerized special effects in the movie will get your attention. The huge polar bears are an important element in the movie. My advice would be just sit back and enjoy this as a fantasy-adventure with clever special effects, and a story which may or may not make any sense to you. The cliffhanger ending is a lead-up to the second in the series which may or may not get made depending upon how well this very expensive effort fares.",1198713600,4,2133,4.801089918256131
1601356,3,B00005JPNY,"I don't usually see a film then read the book.  I like to have the literary influence first--I don't care if they're separate art forms.  This time, though, I'm doing it backwards.  Pullman's worlds are interesting places, if not original in how he creates them.  Conceptually he's not doing anything new, metaphorically indicating the mind control of organized bodies exerting control over children.  What is a bit new is that neither in his discussion around the text nor in the progression of the film, itself, does he hold back that he's doing just that.  In no way is it veiled, the influence of life-altering mind control through the vehicle of a children's story.  If that is unsettling or rouses your ire, this is not your world to explore.  Apart from the challenging concepts driving the film Pullman's very obvious plays on words as charged language reclaimed is remarkable.

On to the pretty: Chosen ""orphaned"" girl saves lives against all odds, with lovely graphic effects and shapeshifting daemons.  The deeper emotional implications of her journey were fairly lacking, which I thought a bit thin.  The visual impact of the film was lovely, coupled with the psychological leaps viewers are expected to make solely based on sheer images.  Speaking off--when did Nicole Kidman gets her lips fluffed?  And Dakota Blue Richards is Tilda Swinton in a time warp, I swear it.

I did come away with one question that I couldn't decipher if it was related to the book or the film.  How was Lyra reading the Alethiometer?  There were the tactile mechanics of the device, yet the special effects of the film indicated she was having an internal experience rather than merely reading the compass.  For me this was problematic in following the base logic of the premise, which is that Lyra is the only one who can read the Alethiometer.  I always have issues in fiction when technology is required to fuel the knowledge of the soul.  In this case it made me question if Lyra was a tool for the Alethiometer, or if it was a tool for her.  Perhaps it doesn't matter, but for me, if it's the former I'm again frustrated with the lack of the imagination to rest knowledge confidently on intuition.  To that end I will chalk it up as refined divination and read on.",1198713600,5,2261,4.746153846153846
1601357,2,B00005JPNY,"I was greatly disappointed with this film after hearing how wonderful the books were.  It was boringly long and the characters lacked any depth especially the various children and the little girl who has the power to be able to ascertain the truth through the compass.

The one interesting thing about the movie is that everyone has their own personal daemon that looks like an animal.  The daemon is able to change at will between different types of animals until its host attains adulthood and then the daemon becomes its permanent form.

The witches are not really clear as to who they are and just seem to appear to save the day out of nowhere.  The bear warrior (a poor imitation of the Lion from The Chronicles of Narnia) has virtually no personality and the director tries to force the audience to feel for him (perhaps this is expanded in the book?).

Daniel Craig has virtually no personality and is totally ungrateful when the girl saves him from poisoning.  Though Nicolle Kidman looks a wickedly beautiful as always, her character also is lacking.

I was bored to tears for more than two hours and lo and behold, the story doesn't finish but like The Empire Strikes Back (where you wonder how Han Solo will be rescued) the story is to be continued in a future film.  For more there is not enough suspense at the end for me to care what happens next.",1198368000,2,1361,4.567901234567901
1601358,5,B00005JPNY,"I'd tried to read THE GOLDEN COMPASS by Philip Pullman at an earlier date on the recommendation of a friend.  I just couldn't hammer my way through it.  The prose seemed too dense, or the pacing was too slow, or there were too many things coming at me at one time.  Whichever it was, I put the book aside.

I never found out that one of the characters was an armored polar bear that was a king who'd been kicked from the throne.  I didn't find that out till the trailers started airing.

Then, while in San Diego at ComicCon, I ran across the huge display they had up for the movie.  I gawped.  I don't often get to write that word, but it's the only one that fits when you turn a corner and run into a gigantic polar bear nose-to-nose.

So I was a tad more curious.  Then my 10 year old started seeing the trailers and I found out what the polar bear was all about.  And we saw the trailers in the theater.  I was blown away.  The hook had been set and my appetite thoroughly whetted.

A few days before I went to see the movie, I heard there was an anti-Christian theme tied to it and a lot of people were going to boycott the film.  I was really curious at that point.  I'd expected a lot of fallout over THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, but people seemed to be okay with that.

Anyway, I tend to make up my own mind about such things.  So I went.

I had a blast.  So did my son.  And I didn't see any anti-Christian themes in the movie.  Sure, the Church was kind of represented as the bad guy, but only if you think that was your church.  Dan Brown did a lot of church-bashing in his book, THE DA VINCI CODE, which was way more edgy in my opinion.

I chucked any theological assumptions at the door and just enjoyed the computer-generated imagery, fantastic characters brought to life by exactly the right mix of actors and actresses, and had a grand adventure in a world that was brilliantly different than my own.

Dakota Blue Richards was absolutely marvelous as Lyra.  Ian McKellen provided the perfect bear's voice for Prince Iorek Byrnison.  Sam Elliott (one of my absolute favorites) played Texas aeronaut Lee Scoresby.  And Nicole Kidman was marvelous as the villainess, Mrs. Coulter.  Daniel Craig breezed through his role as Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel.  Serafina Pekkala portrays the winsome witch queen with proper regal ease.

The movie is a road trip, more or less, and Lyra ends up moving from one obstacle to the next perilous path at a constant pace.  Even though the movie is two hours long, I felt like I'd just sat down when it was time to get up and go.

In addition to providing an adventurous and headlong story, THE GOLDEN COMPASS also provides a visual feast for the eyes.  The city is stunning in all its detail and beauty.  The mix of Victorian pageantry mixed with steam-punk was outstanding, and there was hardly a scene shot that didn't include some impossible or imaginative thing in the background.

The battle at the end of the movie felt like it had a cast of thousands, yet everything that transpired was carefully choreographed.  I watched from the edge of my seat as the events that had been set into motion had played out.  By the time the movie was over, I felt wrung out.

I can't say that anyone involved in the movie had ulterior motives for what they did.  What I can say is that THE GOLDEN COMPASS is one of the best fantasy films I've seen all year.  I think it's perfectly suitable for the whole family.

Now my son and I are going to have to read the books.  We want to know EVERYTHING that happens, and we don't want to have to wait two years for the next movie.",1198368000,9,3619,4.315007429420505
1601359,5,B00005JPNY,"We are invited to revisit so many old tales like The Wizard of Oz and his Dororthy, or Alice and her Wonderland, or Snow-white and her bad step mother or Cinderella and her own bad stepmother. We must admit we are coming back from very far when we look at the most traditional image of women, or girls, in fairy tales and other children's stories. Think of Little Red Riding Hood who sleeps with a wolf, or Sleeping Beauty who cannot but prick her finger on the first spinning wheel she meets. This tale is for girls and this tale is built on a couple. On one side the bad guy, Marisa Coulter, and on the other side the good girl, Lyra. Refreshing. To make it modern and charming the author adds two elements. First animals who are fascinatingly good on the good side and outrageously bad on the bad side, with the polar bears in between, good or bad according to the king they have. Animals have always fascinated children. Then some good special effects to make the movie a dreaming machine with all types of possible fantasies and visions beyond the surface of things. The film is thus conceived as a mirror handed and stretched out to girls for them to fall in the Wonderland it proposes. At the same time it is modern too and tries to get the boys in the theaters by having some good battles, particularly the general one between Marisa Coulter's army and the gypsies who are on the right side and helped by the bears. There definitely is some charm in this film and girls are coming back to the forefront after a long long absence from it. Dorothy and Alice were so long ago. Unluckily we will have to waif for some time if we want to know whether Lyra will save her father or not. That's the only thing I regret. The general meaning is that a child, a girl as well as a boy, must remain rebellious and must disobey orders from adult authority because that adult world is hiding the truth of life and is aiming at cutting these children off (castrate them in a way) from their wild, free and imaginative animal spirits. We have to save children from normalization and standardization, so that they can forever see the cosmic dust that surrounds us and follow the tracks of the golden compass of their imagination and dreams.

1601360,5,B00005JPNY,"""Golden Compass'"" storyline is one that's a well-known favorite for fantasy readers.  It's both an adventure-quest and a coming of age tale for a young orphan. What makes the movie such a standout is the execution of the story both visually and sonically.

""Golden Compass"" world is made up of a variety of life forms. Humans all have daemon bonded to them.  Daemons shapeshift at will while the child's soul is still developing and at some point in their maturity take a fixed animal shape. Witches have the gift of magic, plus the daemons bound to them do not have to remain as close as those bound to mere humans. Ice bears (polar bears) are one of the fiercest and strongest of the peoples and armored ones are often hired as bodyguards.

In the beginning, orphaned Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) has no knowledge of her true parentage. She and her daemon, Pan, are currently the ward of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig). She attends a boarding school, Jordan College.

The story opens with Lord Asriel returning to Jordan College to advise the administration that he's found 'dust' in the Northern Country. 'Dust'is the constituent material of parallel worlds and Asriel believes he can travel between the worlds.  He's asking the College to fund his research.

The Magisterium is a body that's attempting to regulate the world's magical gifts and keep them under control Their representative at the College opposes this research and tries to convince the academics not to sponsor it.  Failing at that, he poisons the wine Lord Asriel was to drink at his presentation.  Fortunately, Lyra was spying and she warned her Uncle before he could take that fateful sip.

The college agrees to sponsor Lord Asriel's research and he's setting about on another mission to the North. Lyra asks to come, but he will not permit it. She is to remain safe at school. Needless to say, this edict doesn't sit well with the strong minded young woman.

After Asriel has departed, Lyra is given the Alethiometer, a Golden Compass, which tells the truth--as long as the person using it knows how to both frame the questions posed and read the answers from the symbols around the compass'outer ring. She's told to keep the device a secret. At one time there were several such devices.  The Magisterium has them all now.

Enter the lovely Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who Lyra first meets at a Jordan College dinner. Mrs. C. takes an immediate fancy to Lyra and offers her a chance to come along with her on a trip to the North to see the Ice Bears. Despite misgivings, the Headmaster releases Lyra into Mrs. C's care.

Lyra quickly learns she has no freedom in Mrs. Coulter's house.  Worse, the Compass keeps displaying GOB, GOB, GOB....Almost too late, Lyra realizes that Mrs. Coulter is one of the Magisterium and a Gobbler to boot--the Gobblers are people who are kidnapping children, who are never seen again.

Lyra and Pan escape. They're helped by a band of Gyptians (wanderers) who get them to Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliot) who is willing to help her if she can get his ship out of hock and help his friend Iorek Byrnison (voice: Ian McKellen) armored ice bear.

The rest of the story is for you to see, but it's very worth the price and the lines at the theatres this time of year.

""Compass"" is one of the most beautifully filmed fantasies since LOTR.  The cast was very well chosen.  I was impressed with Ms. Blue's debut and am hoping to see her in future films.  Voice-overs were perfect for their respective characters and the music was also lovely.

I would not want to miss this show at the theaters.  I've got this one on my wish list for the time when it comes out on DVD.  I am certain I will want to see ""Golden Compass"" again.",1198281600,11,3737,4.65296803652968
1601361,3,B00005JPNY,"For all of its bells and whistles, of which it has many, The Golden Compass is still unable to surpass the status of a replication of one of the countless existing family-friendly fantasy films out there. Even with the astute devising of daemons and the heart-stirringly massive armored bears, it is essentially another version of ""Narnia"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's solid entertainment, but of the repetitious kind - much like it's the sequel to something else, even though it is clearly the first of a series.

Young Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) lives in an alternate world to earth - many of the locations and lands are similar to our planet, but certainly not to be mistaken for the same. The most noticeable difference, aside from the science fiction fantasy blend of technology, is that the souls of humans appear on the outside of their bodies, in the form of animals called Daemons, that faithfully accompany them. Lyra's ever-changing Daemon is known as Pantalaimon (voiced by Freddie Highmore).

When Lyra hears about a forbidden magical particle called dust, beguiling scientist Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman) asks Lyra to join her on a journey to the north as an assistant. Lyra is eager for a chance to escape her schoolwork and follow after her uncle Lord Asrial (Daniel Craig), who is also journeying to the Arctic Circle to investigate a sighting of large quantities of dust. Shortly after her departure, Lyra discovers that Mrs. Coulter is working for the Magisterium, the strict government that rules over the land. Linking Coulter to the recent disappearance of her best friend, Lyra sets out to locate a villainous facility where kidnapped children are used for cruel experimentation. During her travels she is aided by a band of Gyptians, a Texas airship pilot (Sam Elliott), the mysterious witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green) and a giant armored ice bear named Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen) to carve out a path of freedom for the captured children. Along the way she also obtains an Alethiometer, a strange golden compass that tells the truth to those who know how to read (and sure enough she knows how to read it).

There are quite a few innovative ideas at work in The Golden Compass, the first of Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy adaptations. Daemons, the souls that take the shape of animals are unique and well-developed and allow for much of the photorealistic computer graphics work. The fact that they speak and serve as a physical conscience is even more fascinating.

Another aspect, which is certainly not as unique, is the Magisterium, the totalitarian government that controls the alternate world. They keep people in line by telling them what to do - something rebellious little Lyra has great difficulty accepting. The Catholic Church has been in an uproar ever since this project was announced, and has banned its viewing by members due to the Magisterium's loose resemblance to their religious hierarchy. The only way anyone could take offense to possible symbolism in a completely fictitious work is by assuming that such characters resemble them too closely. But the Magisterium is simply an Orwellian dictatorship as witnessed in countless other films. In the movie they are clearly villains - could it be that the church views itself as despotic antagonists?

The armored bear is perhaps the finest accomplishment for the film, although at times he wanders dangerously close to unrealistic. But considering a giant talking bear is already unbelievable, The Golden Compass does a spectacular job of bringing him to life with nearly flawless movement and extraordinary muscle and fur interaction. Several of the daemons are less impressive, including Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey, which at times barely resembles an animal.

Films like The Golden Compass usually have a difficult time with their introduction due to the difficulty of quickly defining an entirely foreign world. They have to provide enough information to make you believe in the fantasy, without overloading you with complex jargon. Despite the ridiculous names that are impossible to keep track of, The Golden Compass does introduce its wonders quickly and relatively clearly so that most audiences won't be left with too many questions. Especially considering there are more films on the way, it's acceptable (although annoying) to keep a few secrets. I would, however, like to know where the ice bear stores his armor.

The most severe criticism, I think, is that the storytelling is rushed.  Chris Weitz (a salute to Chris) had so much to pack in, and he should have been allowed at least another twenty minutes to fill out the story and give the audience a few moments to breathe and just take in the marvelous invention of the production design and the variety of Pullman's imaginings.  The plus side wins, though.  Weitz firmly prevents the kind of shallow overacting that plagues fantasy epics; the characters, even the animated ones, feel like real people.  The casting is the best of any fantasy film since The Wizard of Oz.  Really.  Kidman, who has been getting dumped on for bad choices lately, brings something to Mrs Coulter not even present in the books: a note of piercing, authentic tragedy.  Dakota Blue Richards is a natural, and makes Lyra appealing in a way the sometimes tiresome Lyra of the books is not.  The CGI is superb, the most perfectly integrated dramatically of any yet seen (even the sainted LOTR).  I sincerely hope Wietz is allowed to film the rest of the series.

January 4, 2008: a few days after this film was released, David Germain of AP labeled it a flop.  Four weeks later, it has earned almost 63 million in the US and a whopping 195 million internationally, for a total of 258 million worldwide.  By comparision, Enchanted, which has been playing for 6.5 weeks has earned 226 million and Sweeney Todd which has been open 2 weeks has earned a pathetic 33 million.  What's going on here?  By what stretch of the imagination is The Golden Compass a flop?  Does David Germain has a little Nicole problem?  So far, nobody has labeled Enchanted a flop, or Sweeney Todd a flop.  But, then, they don't challenge the patriarchy.  Also on Huffpost, Philip Slater neartly summarized what this is all about: sexism.  See his post of 12/19 for the lowdown on male critics, and religious bigotry, and how they have conspired to trash this fine film -- a film which continues to hang on in the top fifteen box office draws despite fierce competition.

Overall: B+

GREAT acting and cast choice. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards was excellent as Lyra. Nicole Kidman was also great. Daniel Craig and Eva Green were good too, even though they were each in it for a whopping 10 minutes.

I am disappointed with the ending. I am a huge fan of the books, and I loved the ending to the first book and looked forward to seeing it on screen. However, it was cut out. It will hopefully be the beginning of the second movie. The Golden Compass ended right after the battle, and it ends even before she gets to Lord Asriel to bring him what he needs. I wish it had gotten a little farther. I wouldn't have minded an extra half hour added onto the less than 2 hour movie.

Special effects were fantastic. The bear fight was phenomenal. The Ice Palace looked pretty cool, too. The Alethiometer was portrayed in a pretty cool way, and I loved how Lyra's world looked. The daemons were awesome.

The movie felt rushed to me. One minute Lyra is on the Gyptian ships, then she is suddenly up north and meeting with Iorek. The battle scenes could've lasted longer, especially the final battle scene. The acting was great, but Daniel Craig and Eva Green didn't have enough time to get to their full acting ability.

Overall, a great movie whether you've read the book or not. If you haven't read the book, I think you will enjoy this movie more. If you have, I think you'll find the movie entertaining and cool to finally see the book on screen, but you'll be disappointed with the ending. B+.",1197590400,4,1569,4.452961672473868

She lives at a college, and one day Ms. Coulter (Kidman) is there attending a meeting.  Ms. Coulter picks Lyra to take a trip with her up north.  Although excited to see the ice bears, she is reluctant to leave when her best friend Rober (Walker) is taken away by the Gobblers, a mysterious group of people stealing children.  Before she leaves, the Master of Jordan College gives her an alethiometer.  She is told it will reveal the truth of things to her, but she must not tell Ms. Coulter about it.  When life with Ms. Coulter turns out to not be not what she expected, she runs away to look for her friend Roger.  Lyra though, may be the child of the witches' prophecy, and destined for greater things.

There is more to ""The Golden Compass"" than this, and it all moves pretty fast.  In fact, the film could have used an extra 15-20 minutes of running time to feel less rushed.  Religious undertones from the novel have all been removed, and it will be interesting to see how they continue to pull this off if the final two films in the trilogy get made.  Richards is good as Lyra,  bringing her sassiness and enthusiasm from page to screen successfully.  Kidman is perfect as the evil Ms. Coulter.  Craig has limited screen time but gets the job done as well.  Aside from the running time, the other problem is the lack of an ending.  The end was chopped off to give it a happier ending, and presumably the footage will show up in the next film if it gets made.  Without it though, the film feels a bit incomplete.  ""The Golden Compass"" is not a movie for everyone, and fans of the book may find themselves disappointed.  Still, it is worth seeing.",1197504000,4,1773,4.447204968944099
1601365,3,B00005JPNY,"The Golden Compass is one of those fantasy series that just released one movie just to see how it would do. I honestly hate when film-makers do that. I mean I liked a Series of Unfortunate Events and couldn't wait for another part and then I hear it won't happen because the first didn't make enough money. That movie at least tried to end everything in one movie just in case. The Golden Compass basically ends with nothing being resolved. So if it doesn't make enough money we'll never find out what happens next, well unless you read the books.

  What also bugs me is that the cast is great and if sequels do happen none of them are even signed on for more. Plus if it takes years to make another Dakota Blue Richards might be too old for the part which would be a shame. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig get to make a better movie together since the Invasion and are really good. But it's Dakota Blue Richards that's really needed if another is made. She's a talented young actress that literly came out of nowhere who really owns the part. If the girl in Little Miss Sunshine could be nominated for that then give Dakota Blue Richards a nomination as well.

  The movie looks great and does have some cool battles. Most of the fights are owned by the big Polar Bear who's also a good thing about the movie. It's just that the movie makes you think ok that part was cool and so was that part but that's all ? It could've easily have been longer and the actors really deserved it to be because they are all in top form. It's too short and anti-climatic than they deserved but hey the movie is still 100 times better than Eragon at least. They just need to plan another one quick before Dakota Blue Richards gets too old and because I just wanna see what happens next.",1197417600,3,1769,4.313253012048193

I really enjoyed this film and had a lot of fun watching it. The acting quality was really outstanding with even the CGI Characters behaving in a realistic manner. The animation is consistent throughout the film so as not to break the immaculate reality of the setting. The steam punk elements were visually stunning leaving me memorized in my seat. The film was exciting and entertaining but it didn't quite reach the knock out film level which is why I give it 4.5 stars. I will own it and want to watch it over and over again. I have also included a section for those who are familiar with the book.

I loved the acting quality in the film. I felt that the people involved with the film really had a firm familiarity with the materials both the script and the book. I say this because many of the actors and actresses really hit the right emotional note for their scenes. This is particularly difficult feat with this project because there are a lot of subtle actions being taken and secrets that are not reveled until a latter point in the movie. Some of those things are only revealed in the book. I really appreciated seeing the responses that I expected see to seemingly innocuous events.

The quality of the CGI characters just amazed me both through the amount of emotion that was shown through the characters and through the realistic behaviors and movements. I was very touched to see Iorek's feelings toward Lyra develop and grow. I was also very entertained in the scenes with Mrs. Coulter's monkey, where she was able to be so reserved hiding her emotions and her monkey was not able to hide anything showing her true feelings. I was most amazed by the realistic movements of the various CGI animals. The animators really captured the natural movements and behavior quarks of each animal lending a delightful realism to the film.

The animation was consistent throughout the movie maintaining the immaculate reality. I was able to be pulled into Lyra's world.

The steam punk elements were visually stunning. I particularly enjoyed the gyroscopic propulsion elements and how they were consistent throughout the film whether it was on an air ship or on a carriage. I found it a nice visual addition.

The movie was not a knock out film though. The events were exciting but the end just didn't pop. This was not a big surprise and I would bet that the studio felt the same and for that reason gave the movie a December release instead of a summer release.

For those who are familiar with the book.

Book Was better but it's rare for that not to be the case. In the book Phillip Pullman is able to really build a tension and excitement that just drove me all the way through the last 1/3rd of the book. The ending was more of a knockout in the book although more controversial and darker too.

They made some changes to adapt the book to the movie. the first 2/3rds was true to the timeline with the events occurring in order as they were in the book. The last 1/3rd of the movie had a different order of events than the book but this was done so that they could end the story on a happy note.

That being said the abridgement of the movie was very well done cutting out material to make the movie fit into it's time constraint but also maintaining the spirit of the story. I was very impressed with the movie for that because it is very hard to make the length of a book fit into the short time space of a movie.",1197417600,5,5086,4.6640625
1601397,3,B00005JPNY,"This was a typical fantasy film. It isn't even in the same league as Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia. Not the best I've ever seen, and it could have been longer. I would have liked a bit more character development. It's totally not worth all of the controversy that it's generated. I am a Christian, and I could note a few minor things that were a bit questionable, but nothing too extreme. With that said, I do think that Philip Pullman needs to back off. I also think that the zealous, extremist Christians need to cool it with all of the boycott threats, and I also feel that they owe it to themselves to see a film or to read a book before they can have an opinion on it. Boycotting only draws attention to the film, and people will usually see it regardless...and so, to all of my fellow Christians, please stop making fools of yourselves. Totally ridiculous, and like I said, not worth it. Save your money, and wait for the DVD.",1197417600,5,948,4.331460674157303
1601398,3,B00005JPNY,"There's a lot to like in this movie, so let's start there. The CGI is outstanding, for example. The technology keeps getting better every year, and this movie rides the wave. The bears are about as convincing as anything I've seen, down to the rippling of their thick hides when two crash together in combat. The adventure never stops, keeping a solid pace from one scene to the next, right to the very end.

That's where the not-to-like part of the movie comes in. It seems to end about two chapters before where the book ended. That omission cut out one of the most dramatic sequences in the book, albeit an obvious cliff-hanger and sequel bait - maybe those scenes really do belong at the start of the inevitable next movie rather than the end of this one. One other scene translated badly to movie form, too: finding the ""cut"" child and what followed. The book's version was much darker, maybe a bit much for the film's intended audience. Those were probably the two most crucial scenes in the book. I'd say the movie got pretty much everything right except for those two scenes - the two that really mattered. Oh, and the scene where she discovers her parentage, that suffered badly in translation to the big screen, too.

Like the plot elements, the characters were bleached to pale, bland ghosts of their book form. It's probably just as well. If Lyra had much of a real personality about her, it might have been hard to swallow her effortless skipping from one dramatic victory against crushing odds to the next. A real girl might have had a case of the nerves in single-handedly facing down hundreds of sword-bearing warriors and wolves, or in other of her dramatic moments. Just a little, at least. Not our Lyra - something as credible as a bit of fear or doubt would have smudged the Barbie-like slickness of our little heroine's image.

It's fair adventure and fantasy, with lots for the eyes to enjoy. Not much gets past the optic nerve and into the thinking mind, though.

1601399,2,B00005JPNY,"Pfffft.

Watching this movie is like listening to Paris Hilton reading Othello: we're fairly certain that we ought to be impressed by the material but there's no punch or muscle behind the vaguely epic plot to explain the various grandiose settings and overblown production.

Starring a whole slew of ""Hey! It's..."" A-list actors, ""The Golden Compass"" tells the tale of Lyra, an orphan girl living in a University in a version of Earth that's very different to our own. She's invited by the sinister Mrs. Coulter, an employee of the shadowy Magisterium, to accompany her on a mission to the North, where Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel is researching the mysterious properties of Dust (a mystical and feared substance). When Mrs. Coulter turns out to be something more than she first believed, Lyra escapes and goes on a quest to find her kidnapped friends, reinstate the king of the bears, free imprisoned children from the Magisterium's grasp and return the legendary truth-finding device known as the Alethiometer to her Uncle.

So much for the basic plot. Performance-wise, Dakota Blue Richards is very good as Lyra, and Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (for the two-and-a-half seconds he's actually IN this movie), Eva Green and Sam Elliot do perfectly passable jobs in their roles. There's not much of a chance to really act, given the limitations of the script and editing, and so the supporting human roles, as well as those voice roles filled by the likes of Sir Ian McKellen and Kathy Bates, fall kind of flat.

The script, for what it is, feels often like a mere explanation for the visual effects, as opposed to developing characterisation or furthering the story: it's not terribly memorable and contains nothing you'll not have seen before.

The visuals are amazing, for the most part: top-drawer art and production design coupled with some gorgeous CGI make for some very compelling scenes - there are really only one or two points (Lyra riding on the back of Iorek Byrnison immediately springs to mind) where things look fake. The bottle-of-orange-soda effects when the Alethiometer is doing its thing do begin to grate after a while, though, and the Witches look just like every other Evanescence Emo-wannabe you'd love to smack with a broomstick. But, for the most part, ""The Golden Compass"" is a visual treat.

The editing is really what lets ""The Golden Compass"" down: scenes jump from conflict to resolution at a disappointingly rapid pace, and there's absolutely no chance to develop a sense of connection with any one character because of the lack of time spent on any one situation. Also, the direction is infuriatingly pedestrian: in ""About A Boy"" Chris Weitz proved himself capable of more than silly little American Pie tragedies, but here, he seems to be out of his depth as the potential of Lyra's world and the stunning effects and art of ""The Golden Compass"" go largely unexploited.

This is a very disappointing movie: if you've read the books then don't waste an evening in theatres watching this: a one-time DVD rental will be enough to satisfy your curiosity. Check out ""Stardust"", ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" or ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" instead of this one: they;re far, far more rewarding and much better made movies.",1197158400,15,3272,4.9381818181818184
1601400,2,B00005JPNY,"Philip Pullman's stated plan is to ""undermine the basis"" of Christianity. ""The Golden Compass,"" the movie version of part one of Pullman's trilogy of novels, is an inept and chaotic film whose flimsy philosophical underpinnings are nothing more than a self-deluding narcissism that could only appeal to a sophomoric consciousness.

As bad as it is, ""The Golden Compass"" deserves at least two stars. Nicole Kidman -- the swanky, evil Mrs. Coulter -- reveals yet again that her gifts, in addition to flawless beauty, include acting finesse and fierce craft. Daniel Craig (Lord Asriel) is one of the sexiest men alive; it is criminal that ""The Golden Compass"" uses him for only about ten minutes. Given how little Craig is onscreen, he really should be listed as a cameo, rather than as a featured player. The suggestion of a relationship between masterful, macho, Asriel and tragic ice queen Coulter is delicious; Kidman and Craig's pairing in just these roles would ignite the screen. But they share no screentime.

The special effects are very pretty to look upon, indeed.

As a movie, though, ""Golden Compass"" is all computer generated gimmickry, geegaws and gimcracks. If watching a computer generated bear talk with Ian McKellan's voice makes your day, ""The Golden Compass"" is for you.

Me? I felt like I was lost in a shopping mall overstuffed with cheap, lead-impregnated, Chinese import toys during holiday rush hour. For fantasy to work, the fantasy world has to have internal logic and address deep truths. Viewers who have never traveled to Oz all know, within minutes of first watching the ""The Wizard of Oz"", that Dorothy needs to cling to the Ruby Slippers, and that the Wicked Witch covets them. ""There's no place like home"" resonates for us all. There is no similar internal logic or truth in ""The Golden Compass.""

Characters lack depth and arrive merely to fill some gapping hole in what passes for a plot. When the heroine, Lycra, is lost in the Arctic, a Texas cowboy on a dirigible shows up to rescue her. Sure, why not? It may as well have been Amelia Earhart. Some will find this disregard of coherence charming; I found it to be the most shameless deus ex machina. Ironic that Pullman wants to kill God; this cinematic ""Compass"" can't function without resort to a god from the machine.

Much has been made of the fact that the main character is a heroine. We are supposed to celebrate Pullman's feminism. Hogwash. Lycra is as pretty as Botticelli's Venus and she's, for the most part, as passive as a 1950s Disney cartoon princess. A talking bear rescues her, a cowboy rescues her, a sky-ful of CGI witches rescues her, even the evil villainess, Mrs. Coulter, rescues her. If Lycra shows creativity, courage, or spunk, never mind a convincing adolescent girl's character, it must have been while I was dozing off. And Mrs. Coulter's purely feminine evil is misogyny at its ugliest.

For a story that wants to be revolutionary, ""The Golden Compass"" is entirely retro. The fantasy world is, of course, England, just as it is in ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Narnia"" and ""Harry Potter."" Nobody writes blockbuster fantasy novels about Yiddish-speaking characters; no one has yet given us a blockbuster fantasy world set in New Jersey. That would be too real, too gritty, too working class. And fantasy England is not today's England, of course, a multicultural land of active trade unions. This is Victorian England, when the sun never set on Pullman's ancestors' empire and the lower classes knew their place. Servants, in Pullman's world, are accompanied by docile and loyal doggy daemons. In short, meet the new boss, same as the old misogynist, classist, imperialist boss.

The musical score kept trying to do what the story could not, standing there, hands on hips, shouting, ""You should care about this scene! It's very climactic!""

And I kept wanting to shout back, ""Blast, it's the movie's job to construct a story that makes me feel like the battle is climactic, even if it is filmed silently, as Kurosawa did it! Lay off with the endless crescendos, already!""

The bad guys are priests who inhabit a rectangular version of Vatican City, ""The Magisterium."" ""Magisterium"" is, of course, the Latin word for the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. Christianity kidnaps and tortures little children, lies about ""dust"" (had to keep from sniggering during the ""dust"" scenes) and is responsible for all evil in the world. In short, ""The Golden Compass"" is to Christianity what ""Birth of a Nation"" is to African Americans or ""The Eternal Jew"" is to persons of the Jewish faith.

Outside the evil Magisterium, everyone is good and kind and noble and peaceful. So, they have to eliminate persons of faith in order to make the world a better place.

Atheists tried to do just that during the last century, in the Soviet Empire, in Mao's China and in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. Any knowledge of consensus reality renders ""The Golden Compass"" less a charming children's tale and more what it actually is -- propaganda. And that makes the film sound more exciting than it is.",1197158400,12,5096,4.892236384704519
1601401,3,B00005JPNY,".....I have not read the books so I am not sure as to how well the transition went. However as a movie the jist I got was that its about an orphan girl in an alternate universe, wear peoples souls are on display outside their bodies in the form of an animal they call a daemon.  The State is controlled by The Authority that is apparently a semi religious order, children are disappearing, no one is to talk of ""dust"", there is a race of warrior polar bears who talk, gyptians which are a cross between gypsies/pirates and witches.  The girl has been raised at a college where her uncle does research and when he goes away to the north for futher research into the dust the girl is kidnapped, he is hunted and the chase is on from there.
.....I gotta admit that this is a a rollercoaster ride of a film and it looks technologically nifty but there are some rough patches in the editing when someone is taken and then others are hot on her heels to save her but you don't know how they figured out where to go.  In addition a large world is built for you but you never see the real people and therefore are not sure how they would really react to the Authorities grand plan considering it would be orchestrated on their children in the end and would steal from them something that every parent has spent their entire lives tied to.  It just feels like a few pieces of the puzzle are missing and unintentionally so.  While rarely a proponent for longer films it really dis seem like the Studio cut 10-15 minutes of transitional scenes, explanation and character development.  If not the studios then the director, who has no prior experience on big budget, speciall effects films, simply wasn't up to the task.
.....Still it is a fun film though pretty violent and scary for little kids.  When the bear appears to get his jaw knocked off I was pretty surprised.  Kid torture, animial torture, etc. don't take the under 10 crowd unless they have been desensitized.
.....As to the whole anti religion thing, I see hints of it in the film but then again I am looking for it and am fairly well read but otherwise it seems harmless enough that organized religion should give it a rest.",1197158400,2,2178,4.4275

The special effects were even good...But if you're a huge fan of the book (like me) then I'm afraid you'll find this movie to be a disappointment...I was so sad after watching it; I had waited forever for it to come out, and then it hardly follows the plotline for the book at all. The ending was cliche as anything (kids all running out of Bolvanger while the facility blows up...what?!?!?!), and it wasn't supposed to end where it did. The movie rushed into everything and left out so much that was in the book.

I would have expected a lot better of New Line, especially with their good adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.",1197158400,16,726,4.417910447761194
1601403,3,B00005JPNY,"I have never read any of the books, so I entered the film with very little in the way of an expectation of what the plot would be.  Obviously I had seen the movie trailers, so I knew this was probably something in the NARNIA, ERAGON, perhaps even LORD OF THE RINGS vein.

First of all, it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that this movie is in same category as LOTR.  Those films dared to take their time to tell a story, stretching to epic length.  They developed characters we truly cared about.  And much of the films actually took place in real landscapes.  Think of all the breathtaking New Zealand locations that were used.

GOLDEN COMPASS is almost totally located in a CGI world.  Not for one second does it feel solid or tangible.  It's all very pretty to look at, but honestly it just feels a bit cold.  NARNIA was the same way...it needed some sets that were REAL.

In addition, COMPASS zooms through its story, taking virtually no time to establish characters beyond simple archetypes.  For instance, think of the character Sam Elliott plays.  He's an ""aeronaut,"" basically a pilot for hire (except he flies a motorized hot-air balloon concoction).  Basically, his character is that same guy that Sam Elliott always plays...twinkly eyes, big mustache, grizzled look.  That's it.  We like him, because we always like Sam Elliott.

Anyway, I haven't touched on the plot, which is what has gotten so many people in an uproar, apparently.  The story takes place in a ""parallel"" world, where people's souls live on the outside of them, are called ""daemons"" and take the shape of an animal of some sort.  This is a neat idea...and allows for some of the more fanciful special effects, as we get to see each animal that is attached to a person.  (For children, their ""daemons"" aren't settled yet, so the animal form will change.)  In this world, things seem to be run primarily by The Magesterium...a powerful group of what seems like semi-fascist folks who are against ""free will.""

It's my understanding that in the books, this Magesterium is clearly a reference to the catholic church.  That may be, but in the movie, it feels like a generic ""big brother"" type of organization.  Their goal seems to be to figure out how to separate children from their ""daemons"" so that they are left ""soulless"" or at least without the gumption to resist the Magesterium.  There seems to be any little real logic to any of this...we just have to accept it.

The young girl Lyra is entrusted with The Golden Compass, a device that ""sees what is hidden.""  Naturally, the Magesterium are eager to get this from her, and to thwart her, they send Nicolle Kidman as a charismatic, glamorous woman of means to entice the girl to serve as her assistant.  Lyra learns fairly soon not to trust this woman, and suddenly she sets out on a quest to free the children who've been kidnapped so that their souls can be stolen.

I'm guessing my plot summary is a bit confusing...and frankly, trying to sort all the tangents, politics, allegiances, etc. is tricky, and ultimately not very interesting.  Mostly you just end up watching the movie in order to see all the spectacular scenes.  Are there are some.  The Ice Bears are impressive creations, and the big duel between a couple of them is a highpoint.  Daniel Craig, as Lyra's uncle, has a brief but exciting chase scene out on the frozen tundra.

So the special effects ARE pretty special, for the most part.  (Although I say again, I missed the tangibility of REAL landscapes.)  But the script is trying to pack in too much in short span of time.  The actors are more or less lost in the shuffle.  Kidman looks the part, and she's always been good at playing cold, insincere parts.  Craig has nothing to do, but his eyes look great.  The young lady who plays Lyra is pretty game and well cast.  But no one is going to win an Oscar for this film.  Costumes and makeup do most of the acting.

Even though the film runs just under two hours, I frankly found myself bored at times.  Ironically, I think that if the movie had been longer and taken the time to make us care about the character and to delineate what was at stake a bit better, I would have been more engaged.  As it was, it was mostly a piece of eye candy.",1197158400,16,4251,4.557463672391017
1601404,3,B00005JPNY,"The movie is fun, great to look at, and should receive recognition for the special effects, art direction and photography.  The New York Times aptly described Nicole Kidman as the movie's best special effect - her cold, glacial beauty is perfect for this role.  The biggest disappointment is the brevity of Daniel Craig's role.  When photographed at the premiere, he looked strangely subdued and serious, and in an interview, in his usual tactful manner, mentioned that other scenes were filmed, but not used in the final cut.  He reportedly has great admiration for the book, and most assuredly expected more from his role in the movie.  What a waste of his fine talent, although, as always, he lights up the screen in the moments when he is allowed to appear.",1197158400,,761,4.823076923076923
1601405,5,B00005JPNY,"""The Golden Compass"" is great! This is how the story goes: Based on author Philip Pullman's bestselling novel, The Golden Compass tells the first story in the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, set in an alternative world where people's souls manifest themselves as animals, talking bears fight wars, and one young girl is at the center of a dimension-crossing odyssey. Lyra is a 12-year-old girl who starts out trying to rescue a friend who's been kidnapped by a mysterious organization known as the Gobblers, but winds up on an epic quest to save not only her world, but ours as well.
