I will avoid plot leaks and what have you, but I will tell you that considering that this is a follow up to a story that was pretty much concluded by the end of the first, it does a pretty good job.
 This was put together by the the same writing and directing team and fleshes out the next chapter of Lady Snowblood's irony filled life pretty well. It in no way feels forced, and goes into a slightly different direction than part one as it gets more wrapped up in the conspiracy aspects of the plot and is less focused on the sword play and gore. In other words it is not trying to pander to the crowd ala Star Wars Clone Wars with it's 1000 light sabers.

Anyhow, my suggestion would be to just watch part 1 and 2 back to back, it flows better that way and might be less of a disappointment for those merely wanting more sword play and gore, but who also kind of like the story.",1427241600,,985,4.098445595854923
