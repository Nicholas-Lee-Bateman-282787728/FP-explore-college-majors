6160700,4,B00HETODYO,"With the exception of an overlong and rather turgid military epic, ""Battle of the Bulge,"" this is a strong collection for Henry Fonda fans as it presents the actor in movies with a range of themes and fine supporting actors like Jack Lemmon, Charles Laughton, Walter Pidgeon, Burgess Meredith, Gene Tierney, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews, James Cagney, and Vera Miles. Great directors are also represented in Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful crime drama ""The Wrong Man"", Otto Preminger's superb political drama ""Advise and Consent"", and John Ford's entertaining wartime comedy ""Mister Roberts.""

All four DVDs offer trailers and other extras including commentary on the Preminger and Ford films and featurettes on the other two. ""Mister Roberts"" has excerpts from Ed Sullivan's TV series ""Toast of the Town,"" paying tribute to the actor, and from the documentary ""Fonda on Fonda,"" covering his work on the play and the movie. Formerly packaged in a big box containing four separate cases, known as ""The Signature Collection,"" this low-priced set now comes in a single compact case.",1418601600,3,1075,5.286549707602339
8632139,4,B00HETODYO,"I like Henry Fonda and here is a nice selection for your library.  The terribly inaccurate Battle of the Bulge, which if it had been given a different title would have sufficed as a rather okay war film.  Fonda's role is what links the film together.  But I always speed thru  Robert Shaw's usual snarling performance, and Telly Savalas' corny one (he somehow manages to go from one tank to another with ease).
Mr. Roberts is John Ford's and Mervyn LeRoy's presentation of the Joshua Logan play that Fonda acted in on Broadway.  It has William Powell's last performance and Jack Lemmon's first.  The jokes, especially Lemmon's, are sometimes stale but Fonda does a good job of showing the  disappointment of working for a Martinet.
The Wrong Man is Alfred Hitchcock's documentary of a true story. (See the Features.)  Vera Mile's performance is stunning.
Advise and Consent, Preminger's 1962 look at how the U.S. Senate goes about ruining lives in the name of politics.  (Watch and read the caption lines of Laughton's investigation of Fonda's supposed Communist ties while thinking about today's Senate hearings.)
 A nice set, marred not by the acting but the cliched, and lack of snow, Bulge movie.",1501027200,,1200,4.925373134328358
