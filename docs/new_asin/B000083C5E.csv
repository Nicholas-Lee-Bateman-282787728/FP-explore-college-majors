2384342,5,B000083C5E,"A woman is eating soup when she finds a strange object in her soup -- a curly-headed pixie who becomes enamored of her uvula and steals it. Thus begins a weird claymation sequence involving ghastly rag dolls, snakes, killer crows, and more pixies.

This one scene alone tells you just what kind of movie ""The Happiness of the Katakuris"" is, and whether you're going to like it. Takashi Miike -- well known for gruesome action movies -- is pretty obviously having a ball as he tells the colorful, chaotic story of a singing family and the people who have the misfortune to visit their hotel. Zombies, random musical numbers, and family strife are all here in abundance.

The Katakuri family is made up of four generations of family, criminal activity, and general hopelessness -- the only one currently immune is the little granddaughter.

And things are not improved when the head of the family Masao (Kenji Sawada) is laid off from his job. So he purchases a remote hotel, after being told that a major road is going to be run nearby. But nobody checks in until one rainy night, when a strange man appears -- and then stabs himself on a sharpened keychain. Cue the Japanese techno and dance number!

Terrified that the suicide will ruin their reputation, the Katakuris surreptitiously bury the man in the woods -- only to have more guests die in bizarre ways, and end up buried in the woods. Oh yeah, and Shizue's (Naomi Nishida) new boyfriend is a criminal. As a typhoon approaches and their secret burials are threatened with discovery, can this family of failures pull it together -- or will everything blow up in their faces?

I have to say that Takashi Miike -- famous for the graphic and horrific ""Ichi the Killer"" -- is not the first person I'd have chosen for a black-comedy/musical about a family running an ill-fated hotel. Especially since I have a special fondness for the Korean movie it remakes, ""The Quiet Family."" But Miike's work on this is nothing short of brilliant -- a comedy of increasingly grotesque errors, leading up to a literally explosive finale.

A lot of its charm is that Miike does not let his style be constrained by logic -- there are wild random musical numbers, claymation interludes, disco balls, wacky spiritualists, and a flying conman who claims to be the Queen's secret nephew (""Diana! If only I was there!""). He shows no restraint at all, even climaxing the film in a crazy scene where the fear-addled Katakuris -- who are trying to re-bury those troublesome corpses -- do a carefree song-and-dance scene with a bunch of zombies. It has to be seen to be believed.

And it's really funny too. While the plot starts at a rather relaxed pace (excluding the uvula-stealing pixies), Miike cranks up the absurdity with plenty of lowbrow humor (a sumo wrestler dies during sex, and crushes his girlfriend), gore, and a general feeling of surreality. Things just get more hysterical and desperate for the poor Katakuris, and Miike never gives them a break (""Maybe we should prepare for the worst,"" one of them says when a guest solemnly requests some cord).

Surprisingly for a black comedy, the characters are rather likable, if pathetic -- the dad and mom are just trying to keep the hotel afloat while proclaiming love to each other. Tetsuro Tamba's lovable old grandpa is just trying to keep his family safe when he isn't killing crows and assaulting suitors. Nishida is also quite good as an eternally desperate divorcee, who is almost superhumanly gullible when it comes to men.

""The Happiness of the Katakuris"" is a perfect example of a black comedy -- warped, wild, wacky, and full of clay pixies and singing zombies. Now if only somebody could get Peter Jackson to remake this puppy...",1218758400,4,3730,4.770542635658915
2384343,4,B000083C5E,"Katakuri-ke no kfuku is an exceedingly inventive and entertaining film that exploits a wide range of film techniques to often stunning effect. For quite a bit of this film, it looks and feeis very much like Peter Greenaway's ""Drowning by Numbers"".  Director Takashi Miike goes way over the top to create an emotionally rich and deeply sentimental portrait of the spirit of love.
Overall, the musical numbers lift this film into a strange and magical realm. Songs about rotting corpses and romantic longing are perfectly compatible.  The film exists in a perpetual dreamlike state that is quite intoxicating.  The whole film is romantic--from the longing to run a mountain guesthouse as a family to Shizue's longing for love in the guise of a conman (Kiyoshiro Imawano).
I must admit to spending quite a bit of the film swooning over the heavenly Naomi Nishida, who plays the lovelorn Shizue.  She's exquisite--sort of a cross between a young Mia Farrow and Delphine Seyrig.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well.  Although this isn't a film made by the acting, necessarily, the performances are all expertly utilized and fit into the film's overall structure.
It really is an insane romp in this film.  Bodies pile up and they must be disposed.  This film  alternates between being scary, gross, hilarious, heartwarming, goofy, philosophical, demented, sick, melodramatic, effervescent, ribald, and crude. The songs are lovely and the sentiments are tender and sweet.  This is a family that is seeting with potentially devestating chaos just under the surface.  Instead of celebrating the dysfunctional aspects, this film focuses on the commonalities that serve as inspiration for the family members in their quest for a happy life.  The overall result is delightful, despite and maybe because of the all-singing, all dancing zombies.",1089590400,7,1840,5.158249158249158
2384344,5,B000083C5E,"Happiness of the Katakuris is just another glorious scoop for the Miike - the master of bizarre. It is a horror comedy musical (yes musical with the capital M) and since Miike can shoot any type of a movie without messing it, you are guaranteed to have  over the top crazy hours in front of your TV
Film starts with a crazy Tim Burton style animation (something even too nuts for Tim's standarts). Here we have a nice Japanese family trying to make a living by opening a small hotel in the middle of nowhere. Family members are nice people : optimistic father, supportive mum, divorced and searching daughter,problematic son and cute grand daughter. They wait for the customers desperately and hope for the road construction to end and bring many people to the area. But katakuris are a bit down on the luck, most of the customers are extremely strange people who happen to die in their rooms . Katakuris however are optimistic and deal with the dead in full family union, becoming professional grave diggers.
Film is a musical as I mentioned and the dances are hilarious . Check grandpa's dances for instance. The first singing and dancing bit (after the death of the first customer) is a hilarious thriller take on. But thats not the only original moment for sure. You have plenty of those. For example,a karaoke singing bit in which we are invited to sing along as well(shot in a cheap karaoke clip type, check the dresses and acting !)is absolutely a cult moment.
Miike uses his animations on the too difficult or too expensive to shot sequences, making film even crazier.
But against all odds and nuts, film has a very optimistic as well as a positive message. Keeping family together and not loosing hope in the hard times (just like in other musicals) is always mentioned but in a very sinister way of course.
Yes Miike has done it again. Director who shot the straight and
gentle documentary like ""bird people of China"", odd ball action ""city of lost souls"", cold yakuza thriller ""rainy dog"" and straight starting but crazy ending bizarre ""dead or alive"" etc gave us this movie which can be put in the same category with the films like ""brain dead"" by Jackson. If you like miike, get this movie. If you like black comedy again get this movie.
If you like Japanese odd movies, then here comes another jewel to put it on your collection. And don't forget not to eat anything while watching. You may choke and end up like the customers of Katakuris.",1045872000,8,2454,4.628440366972477
8077552,5,B000083C5E,"I wouldn't say the first few minutes are completely representative of the whole movie, but I imagine it can be used as a decent gauge of how much you'll like the rest. I found it to be a unique, triumphant experience. Takeshi Miike proves again his talent for filmmaking. Fans of strange Asian movies, horror-comedy, and rocky horror picture show should not miss this one.",1519603200,,372,4.7384615384615385
8077553,1,B000083C5E,"Terrible! Japanese musical, modern dance, comedy horror.",1515196800,,56,7.142857142857143
8077554,5,B000083C5E,"This is black humor at its best. The technical aspects of the film are adequate for 2017, though not of the highest budget class; view it in 4k - you'll enjoy it with the whole family (age 15+). Some may whine that it's copycatting Rocky Horror or Little Shop of Horrors, but the message of the film is consistent, the motifs and symbolism impactful. It is commentary on our pathetic lot as a species doomed to go extinct on our failing, dying planet. If you are depressed over everything you read/hear on the news, podcasts, youtube, etc. this is the film for you; it'll make you feel better believe me.",1508544000,2,604,4.5
8077555,5,B000083C5E,"Saw this movie years ago in a small art house theater (Shout out to the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, NY). Everyone in the audience, myself included, was shrieking with laughter. Its truly a weird and joyous film",1508198400,,224,4.769230769230769

8077557,4,B000083C5E,"Let me just say that this movie was commemorative after watching it the first time. So much so that I was compelled to buy a copy for myself after watching it with a friend. As a zombie fan, I love that genre. Don't let others mislead you though, this is not all about the undead. Typically to a Takashi Miike film it has a sense of weirdness that draws you in and holds your attention. This movie is bizarre and freak, and  anything but what the westerns would consider normal. That's what truly makes it special though. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good story, with a crazy, plot, and wants a few laughs in between.",1386028800,,641,4.297520661157025
8077558,4,B000083C5E,"The film in itself was a joy to watch; brilliantly contrived and executed. I laughed all the way through at the self-aware and ironic cliches.

However, the film was incorrectly marketed in this DVD version as a ""Sound of Music"" meets zombie romp film. Perhaps this is due to the zombie franchise boom over the past few years, but as a result of the marketing I couldn't help but feel disappointed despite the superb quality of the film in all other respects (disappointed at the lack of zombies, of course).

I suppose that so long as you are aware of that fact before buying this edition, you will have a much better experience of watching it than me. Enjoy!",1265673600,3,660,4.53781512605042
8077559,5,B000083C5E,"Yes, it is as stated--horror, comedy, musical, with claymation special effects--with English subtitles, no less. As I was watching it my mouth was agape (I couldn't believe what I was watching, yet I couldn't look away.) Though the music did not make me want to burst out singing, the average voices of our ""everyman"" Japanese family seemed sort of charming. File this movie under ""Things that make you go Huh!""",1262995200,,411,4.885714285714286
8077560,5,B000083C5E,"I've never been to Japan (but plan to every year), so my take on this movie is probably as good as any of you guys stateside.  I found this neat flick through another movie, [...].  A reviewer called that movie, ""weird, wild, wacky"" and compared it to this movie.  I think when you are not from a culture, you are basically at a lost when it comes to frames of reference.  I know I thought about Tim Burton's movies, Amelie, and even some Broadway shows.  The U.S. release of this film tags it as ""The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the Dead.""  Reviewers draw up a gangbang of Western movies to compare it to. The geekier J-Horror fans waste no time in bellyaching that director Takashi Miike -  one of the masters of extreme horror who was responsible for Audition and Ichi, the Killer - did not live up to his abilities to shock and awe their fanboy aesthetics.  Of course, that's because these films are the only creations of Miike that most people outside of Japan have been exposed to.  It should be noted that Miike also made acclaimed films for children.

I think there's more to this film than merely ""weird"" ""cheesy"" or ""makes no sense at all.""  Just the opening clay sequence alone has elements of Buddhist reincarnation, Shinto aspects of cycle-of-life in consumption, and the concept of Natural Selection.  In fact, the grandfather even makes a beautiful speech about man vs wild in the bigger picture of evolution.  So, it's definitely not a pure horror film, even though the cover bills it in that direction: the zombies only show up for one or two minutes (in a happy sing song number).  Zombie genre is just another category Miike throws into the mix.  I honestly didn't understand why reviewers said the film made little sense.  The storyline is really a very straightforward musical of a family trying to run an inn by the mountainside.  If the narrative seems a bit jittery, and characters morph into claymation during action sequences, that's easy to explain.  If you see the beginning - post -opening-sequence- scene, you'll notice that the narrator of the story, is the little 5 yr (?) old daughter.  So of course the ""'shrooms index"" is going to be a little on the high side.

Then there's the cliches.  I think Miike is throwing many Western and Eastern cliches into a huge technicolor blender and making entertainment out of it.  The Westerners will only see what they are familiar with, but there's also the Eastern cliches that are parodied here.  The long, drawn out, overacted death scene, the penitent filial son, and the romantic Naomi Nishida, who gets conned by a cad full of lies.  (Where else can you see three generations of a family break out into a heavy metal song when they discover a dead body in one of their guest rooms?)

The character of Richard Sagawa, who swindles Nishida into thinking he is a secret agent for the Queen of England and a soldier in the American Navy (with horrid fitting uniform) has what I always notice as a recurring undertone on the West's relationship to the East in many Japanese movies.  In this instance, it's how the West is sometimes ""dressed up"" to lure the younger, romantic generation away from their traditional ways (i.e. the family).  The horrific pollution just outside the guest house grounds is also a strong eco-conscious statement that Kurosawa wrestled with in Dreams.

The dancing and music is a good laugh.  I'm not sure how serious one can expect the choreography to be when the film doesn't appear to take itself all too seriously.  The gorgeous and touching Karaoke-screen duet between Kenji Sawada's Masao and his wife Terue (""but your gentle true heart is my solace"") is to die for!  That's the mastery of Miike: he has been involved in such a wide spectrum of films, he can summon a genre in any moment with effortless skill.  The parents will be having a quiet dinner when an unexpected guest turns the film instantly into the scariest scene that sends you running for the pillows.  Then suddenly you're laughing at a mopey family bowing in Kata while soaked in rain water. Tetsuro Tamba's facial expression in the closing scenes transforms the movie into an epic moment of man's struggle against father time, and before you can even react, Oooo! Hello Kitty sparkles!",1261440000,2,4262,4.7008086253369274
8077561,4,B000083C5E,"First off, let me say that this film is NOT for everyone. Heck, it's not even for people who would look at the author & go ""Hey, I like Miike's stuff"". The film is strange, funny & more than a little bit disturbing. More than likely the average viewer may be turned off by the film, yet have a funny desire to see it again.

The film's plot surrounds a family that owns an unsuccessful inn. They've sunk just about everything they own into running the inn, yet something bad seems to happen to everyone who attempts to stay there. The family attempts to cover up these deaths & end up putting themselves even more at risk over time.

With strange claymation, musical scenes & dance numbers, this film is very unlikely to be like anything you've seen before. Unless you've seen some of Miike's other works- then you know that off the wall stuff is just par for the course. It honestly took me a while to let this film sink in after I finished watching it. It was the first of Miike's works that I've ever watched & as such, I wasn't really prepared for his unique filmmaking style. You either like this movie or you don't. I personally thought the movie was a hoot, yet my best friend hated it. There's very little middle ground when watching this film.

I'd honestly recommend that the average viewer rents this before buying it. I can't guarantee that you'll like this film.
