8193072,3,B000PSISQA,"If you're a newbie to the Law of Attraction, then this is for you.  I've been studying within those circles for some time now.  So I did not learn anything new.  But this product is cheaper to buy here, than directly from the seller.",1404172800,,233,4.25
8193073,3,B000PSISQA,"Like I said, it was OK.. I was expecting something more.. not sure what, but something more.  Belief systems, I learned this 25years ago. Just a reminder again, said differently..",1240185600,2,179,4.966666666666667
8193074,1,B000PSISQA,"Extremely disappointing, poor quality production and of no redeeming value except to have the author tell you how great he thinks he is.  Very poor over all.",1234742400,5,157,4.814814814814815
8193075,1,B000PSISQA,Joe is NOT a great marketer.  He's good.  He is perceived as great because he's chosen an easy market...law of attraction junkies.  The truth is you can read several books on this and learn what you need to know.  Here's the real secret...Stop Buying More Stuff In Search of the MISSING Secret.  Only then will people stop selling you more.  Everything you need to know about the law of attraction can be found in the Abraham-Hicks book/cds.  And for a nominal cost compared to what everyone else is charging.  Go to the source of the information.,1209340800,29,547,4.625
8193076,1,B000PSISQA,"I totally agree that this DVD is a rip-off.  Joe Vitale never gives more than the mearest hint of the subjects he speaks of.  I assume this is because that's all he can say to avoid plagarism since most of what he does have to say are things already stated by others, many with whom he has a marketing relationship.  There are some great teachers in ""THE SECRET"".  Joe is not one of them.  As the prior review suggests, thumb through some of his books in a bookstore and see for yourself.",1201564800,71,488,4.260869565217392
8193077,3,B000PSISQA,"This product is a set of videos from two lectures that Joe did at the Austin World Wellness Weekend and at a Religious Science Ministers meeting. Joe presented his current ideas on the secret and what he was working on now. Joe of course covered his current explorations, which included his new book 'Zero Limits'.  These were good lectures and I found them very interesting.  Was this video a good deal at forty bucks?  I'm not sure.  I would have thought it great at twenty however.

  For every book that Joe puts out on Amazon there are always a few really bad reviews.  I'm sure that those people just don't understand Joe.  I like Joe.  He's a prolific writer, an excellent marketer, and a long time student of self improvement.  When you get a product from Joe, you have to remember one basic fact.  Joe is a marketer to the bottom of his soul.  It is impossible for him to write without promoting something.  It's his nature.  He can't tell you something without plugging something he's doing, or selling, or one of his friends is selling.  Expect it. Birds gotta fly, fish gotta swim, and Joe has gotta sell stuff.  If that was the whole picture, you could just laugh off Joe as another BS artist.

  But it's not that simple.  For behind all that marketing hype, Joe looks at some really interesting stuff.  He has interesting friends that know stuff.  He has something to say that's worthwhile. Will it be exactly what he tells you he will say?  Well, maybe it will or maybe not all he promised.  But most of the time Joe's doing something interesting and it's worth it to find out what he's into now.

  So there, I've said it.  I like Joe.  He's used his ability to sell to live his dreams.  As a part time copywriter myself I envy his ability to sell and promote things.  Do I blindly buy all his products?  No. I check them out and only buy the good ones.  Mainly, I look at what he's involved in and see if I want to know more about it. That's the way I think you should take Joe too. So,lighten up on Joe.",1189900800,30,2022,4.346774193548387
