Running the film with the sound off but commentary on after seeing it in the normal way, shows you these people with their hopes and energies shining though.  The lesson is clear, if you are young, beautiful and sexy, and female, you get invited to the party in the nice apartment, but you are still really on the outside as far as the world is concerned.  It is a world where accomplishment is hard to come by and if you hit it even once you can party on it for decades as you slide down further and further.
