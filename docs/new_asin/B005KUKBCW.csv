Sometimes an animals reactions are predictable but in this film, it is quite the contrary. A animals reactions is quite interesting, given the environment its in. Animals don't need to say anything, their actions are all you need. Beware, you have been warned!

We use high definition professional cameras to capture various animals from family and friends and measure their reactions. A voice over is used to describe what we perceive as the animals ""inner thoughts."" We have been pretty successful with finding animals but we are starting to run out. The funds will be used for various purposes. Such as paying fees to get into a regular zoo, petting zoo, safari, woods, forest, jungle, etc.. and use the animals in their natural habitat. We also may pay other people to temporary use their animals in our films.",1322438400,,930,4.849056603773585
