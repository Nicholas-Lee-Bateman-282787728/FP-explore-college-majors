8197069,5,B000QRIKOA,"If you are a Victor McLaglen fan, this is a rare treat to see him as an everyday guy. The movie has it's hair-brain funny moments, thanks to Zasu Pitts and Patsy Kelly. These two ladies were so funny in their day, each with their own style of good, clean fun.",1477094400,,259,4.098039215686274

8197071,3,B000QRIKOA,Story line in this movie was kind of scattered.  But it was fun seeing the old train!,1426550400,,85,4.0
8197072,2,B000QRIKOA,"I can only give two stars for this dvd.  Not because of content and most certainly not because of delivery, it arrived QUICKLY!  I'm giving it 'two Stars' because of its 'quality'.  I gave it 'two stars' because the movie itself is good but the 'quality' is extremely POOR!!!!!  The case photo is very attractive and motivated me to purchase it for my husband, a train enthusiast, as a gift for this past Christmas.  When we viewed the movie together, my gosh... the storyline is cute and the train footage is absolutely EXCELLENT... but the 'quality' of the film or whatever is was transferred from is ABSOLUTELY 'TERRIBLE'!!!!  I am not going after the seller but they should be aware of what some of these DVD companies are selling them for the public to buy!  We're going to keep looking and try to 'TRACK' ================== down another copy of this (what would have been a 'fun family' 'train movie') to watch'.",1422489600,3,918,4.6645962732919255
8197073,4,B000QRIKOA,"I got this for my husband who loves the old train movies. He enjoyed it, very good sound and video quality. If you don't like the older classic movies, this won't be for you.",1391731200,,174,4.147058823529412
8197074,1,B000QRIKOA,"This Alpha Video is a DvD-R. I bought this particular version because Alpha Video normally produces factory pressings of nostalgic films. What I got was a factory sealed case with a scratched DvD-R with Alpha Video logo. If cheap DvD-Rs are being sold, they need to be declared. Nowhere was it stated that this particular product by Alpha video was a DvD-R. I won't buy Alpha Video products any longer if this is what they are now selling.

Edit: I notice Amazon has finally declared this product to be a DVD-R. It was not declared when I purchased it, and I made a formal complaint to Amazon at the time.",1363219200,5,605,4.5
8197075,5,B000QRIKOA,"Interesting story line, but this movie is perfect for fans of the PRR.  Many interior shots of the Broadway Limited, as well as exterior views of the cars and engines.",1331424000,2,167,4.566666666666666
