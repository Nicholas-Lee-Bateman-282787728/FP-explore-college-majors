''The Defiant Ones'' is one of those rare films which after having been seen only once had the ability to stick with me for an entire lifetime! (Other such gems having had a similar effect on me include Chaplin's first 'talkie,' ''The Great Dictator,'' the original ''Night of the Living Dead,'' the cheesy and awful but fun sci-fi cult flick ''Laserblast,'' and Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane.'') I've just had the opportunity to purchase the DVD and view this film for only the second time, and it was every bit as good and intense as I remember from that first time!
''The Defiant Ones'' teams up the legendary Tony Curtis and the equally legendary and talented Sidney Poitier as convicted felons John ''Joker'' Jackson and Noah Cullen who, as a result of a racially sparked physical scuffle between the two of them, partly contribute to the road accident their transport vehicle becomes involved in. The resulting crash gives these two chained together prisoners an opportunity to escape on foot.
But this is pre-1960s southern USA, so when the arriving law officers responsible for tracking the prisoners down learn that the two chained together escaped cons are of different racial backgrounds they become somewhat lax in their pursuit, erroneously assuming that the two escapees would likely kill each other out of racial hatred before they'd even get five miles.
Forced to cooperate despite the racial tensions between them, Joker and Noah do not take their predicament lightly and are constantly on the move to stay as far ahead of their pursuers as possible. In the days that follow both men form something of an uneasy camaraderie, and the conversations they strike up between themselves actually seem to help smooth over some of those racial tensions they exhibit toward each other, to where each man gains a certain amount of respect for the other. Joker is also made to confront some unpleasant realities, such as being forced to admit in his heart that Noah is the more rational of the two and, especially, having to come to terms with the fact that his white skin is no safety net when he is an escaped criminal on the run.
There is also a 'human interest' story in the subplot of the film, some of it just somewhat ahead of its time: The County Sheriff becomes the catalyst which keeps the chase from becoming a reckless and disorderly ''Good Ol' Boy'' guns, dawgs & testosterone party, and one of the townspeople, portrayed by the legendary Lon Chaney Jr., keeps a town's citizenry from becoming an emotionally irrational lynch mob.
The cinematography is excellent for a movie of its time, although some of the sets could have been better constructed and arranged (for example, there's one set where the city lights of Los Angeles shine in the background beyond the studio lot). It is also nice to hear actors talking with southern accents that don't sound like ''Foghorn Leghorn'' rejects.
To even consider ''remaking'' this classic film would not only be a terrible mistake, but it would also be a virtual impossibility ... so hopefully no one in Hollyweird, or anywhere else for that matter, would ever think of doing such a thing, and thus let this great piece of movie making history stand on its own and to continue to stand the test of time.

810265,2,6304196903,"Vastly overrated. While the subject matter of this film was surely controversial in 1958, it's simply not a good film: Tony Curtis doesn't'  sound believable for a second as a supposedly tough convict, Theodore Bikel  (? - a Jewish singer/actor) as a Southern sheriff isn't believable either,  and the entire concept of a woman so lonely that she would take in not only  two convicts in chains, but a black prisoner at all, is completely  laughable. There are some fine moments in this, and I understand its  cultural importance, but it's nothing special.

810394,4,6304196903,"Review of The Defiant Ones
Hot Toasty Rag, November 12, 2017

Theres a good chance youve seen a clip of The Defiant Ones interspersed into a montage of famous films. If youve seen Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis chained together and running from bloodhounds, an angry mob, or alongside a train, those famous images are from Stanley Kramers Oscar-winning drama.

The plot is simple but intense. After a truck carrying a load of prisoners crashes and most of the passengers are killed, its discovered that two have escaped: Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. They have a deep and bitter hatred of each other, but because they're shackled together at the wrist, they're forced to depend on and trust one another in order to survive.

Both Sidney and Tony gave excellent, career-defining performances, and they were both nominated for Best Actor at the 1959 Oscars. Unfortunately, they were both beaten out by David Niven, whose role in the ensemble Separate Tables should have been included in the Best Supporting Actor category instead. The Defiant Ones was also nominated for Best Picture, Director, Editing, Supporting Actor for Theodore Bikel, and Supporting Actress for Cara Williams. It won for Cinematography and Original Screenplay, but when you watch the film, youll be appalled that the two leads didn't bring home matching statues.

If you haven't seen this classic, rent it this weekend and get ready for an extremely thrilling screening. Its difficult to make the entire running time of a film suspenseful, but this film is filled with emotional and physical conflict and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",1510444800,,1634,5.018450184501845

810484,4,6304196903,"The ending ruined the film for me.  I understand that the director/producers who ever was responsible for the message behind this film was rather concerned with political correctness and decided to show us a utopian type of ending, where the white and black stick around for each other, but--I mean come on Hollywood? Where is your sense? They simply over did it in this one.  I think the message is obvious, the two convicts who are of opposite race depict United States back in the days when the wounds of civil war haven't healed completely and Jim Crow Laws are still widely in effect.  The problem is that, who ever was responsible for the plot must have been really nave to believe in that sort of human spirit and solidarity.  In real, brutal, and dog-eat-dog life every man is for himself and his own well being.  That might sound to some pessimistic and harsh, but that is the reality of life.  Back in 1950's when this motion picture was filmed the facts of life were even more on my side, since no white guy nor black guy would have done what Johnny did at the end.  In real life, a person like Johnny or even Noah would not have sacrificed their own well being for the other one, unless of course there is something Stanley Kramer is not telling us about the last two scenes of this film.  But on the other hand I was not that surprised by the ending. I am talking here about a Jewish-American movie maker who more than likely had very liberal/socialit views of America, and who must have believed in human goodness like a nave child.  Also, was it only me or was the ending tiny bit ""homosexual"" ???

The film is in black and white, and it felt like watching Cool Hand Luke (1967) mixed with Touch of Evil (1958).  Too bad the ending wasn't realistic enough.",1423785600,,1771,4.435185185185185

810531,5,6304196903,"""The Defiant Ones"" is a timeless film with a message that endures to this day. It gets a little slow about 3/4 of the way through the film, but trust me on this, if you stay with the movie until the very end, you will not be disappointed. The film's strongest points are the most subtle of actions. Tony Curtis' character makes sure to break off the end of the cigarette his black companion has lit before he takes a puff of his own. He will not put his lips on the same cigarette butt that Sidney Poitier's character was smoking, because these are two Southerners, one black and one white. Later in the film, his behavior is completely different.

If this movie were to be released today as a brand-new film, it probably wouldn't be successful. The message spoke clearly to movie viewers of 1958, and I think it's important to try and view this film through their eyes and not our own. I would consider this to be a movie worth renting from a video store or Netflix to watch once, but it's not necessarily worth paying money to own the DVD. Watching it once in a lifetime will be enough for most people. Also, this film, despite the color-rich DVD artwork, is distinctly old-school black-and white, and I know some people just aren't into black-and-white movies.",1381795200,,1263,4.5152838427947595

In this film Poitier did so, not by fawning submission or by becoming an equally repugnant black racist, but by treating his enemy with the same consideration he desired for himself.  He was living the second greatest commandment ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" (Mt. 22:39)  His enemy became his friend.

However, what I noticed in this movie was the under tones of homoeroticism, which to me was also groundbreaking during this period.  Not only were black and white separated by realities that Joker constantly reminded Cullen of, but also there seemed to be a line that was being crossed in regards to the relationship itself.  They were falling asleep in each other's arms for heavens sake!  Cullen even carries Joker to bed LOL! Then Joker leaves a white woman to be with a black man by arguing with her that ""she doesn't know him"" and I couldn't help but to see what wasn't stated by him that ""Cullen does know him"".  The two defiant ones got to the foundation of their hatred, that it is all conditioned based on their mutual acceptance of what they had learned during this period of American history.  With the walls torn down the heart surrenders to the love that caused it.  And then there is the ending.  A sacrifice for a friend because it is more powerful than any walls or chains.  At first they were bonded by the chain and then by the end, by the heart.  Cullen hinted at this near the end as well.  Simply quite beautiful and because I am a gay man these things stick out to me maybe more so than the average viewer.

Films depicting racial injustice have been done repeatedly, and so the storyline of two men, black and white, having to work together to escape to freedom probably won't wow some viewers.  However, this film gets its strength primarily in its depth of characterization. We don't just have the two characters, one black and one white, glossed over or just given the usual stereotyped dialogue, there's a little bit more depth to these characters and we learn a good deal about them throughout the film.

Sidney Pointer and Tony Curtis play two convicts on the run after their bus crashes. Shacked and dependent on one another for escape, the pair are forced to learn about other forces in their lives, what brought them to this point. There were moments when this film could have taken common roads to achieve its lesson, but there is more intricate character depth which makes this film special.

810591,5,6304196903,"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! Here's another great ""prison"" movie from Hollywood. This one stars Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier. They are chained together when they make their escape. It's not as simple as it sounds; the movie takes place at an unspecified location in the southern U.S. in the late fifties. This was a very unususl situation, the chaining of white & black together in that period. Of course, the Tony Curtis character is a bigot which makes the escape & survival of the two convicts a very complicated thing.

Sidney Poitier is excellent, he should be recognized as one of America's greatest actors. Mr. Poitier must be given credit for breaking down some of the walls that hindered black actors in those days. Tony Curtis, though not the greatest of actors, does a very credible job in his role, Bronx accent not withstanding. In fact, the characters are so well constructed that the audience feels empathy toward them. Director Stanley Kramer has done one of his best jobs ever. This was a very risky movie to be making in 1958; but the control of the huge movie studios were slipping, and in fact, this was an independent production, which is why this movie got made in that day.

Enjoy a movie that was ahead of its time in 1958. It's not only a good movie, it's also an historically important movie.",1198454400,3,1308,4.682608695652174

810627,5,6304196903,"I first saw this film as a child, a few times later as a teen and as an adult (whatever ""an adult"" is), and always remembered it as one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  Having recently caught it yet again, uncut, unedited on cable, here in my early 50's, I have to say this remains one of my all time favorite films.  And its message of racial tolerance, understanding, and cooperation, remains as true today as it was when it was first released, back in the ""Jim Crow LAW"" days.  Years before the civil rights movement and altered ""laws,"" and decades after when the black/white racial divides still existing today were marked by the tragedies and incomprehensibility of what happened following Hurricane Katrina.  While so much of the racial hatreds and insanities from the period in American history from which this story and movie is taken may seem dated to some, I seriously doubt such a frank and honest portrayal of same could be even made, let alone financed, produced, and released/distributed today.  Yet, it remains a potent indictment of racial prejudice and especially hatred, all based upon the silly and meaningless pigment of someone's skin.

Nominated for nine Academy awards, including best picture, this film tells a quite raw, but satisfyingly linear and always satisfying story of a black man and a white man, chained together, escaped ""criminals,"" who lead ""law"" enforcement (while still chained together throughout most of the picture) on a chase, not unlike that which was later reworked in the popular Harrison Ford vehicle ""The Fugitive.""  While I really liked the movie version of the Fugitive TV show, this particular film seems a very reputable updating, with the only differences being the twosome (black/white man fugitives), instead of the singular white man.  An updating, decades before, however.

Tony Curtis (""Johnny"" and ""Joker"") and Sidney Poitier (Noah Cullen) give perhaps the best performances of both of their lives, not only cinematically, character driven-wise, but in their real lives.  While both actors went on to even greater achievements, I'm sure both would've ranked their performances in this, amongst their greatest, and most rewarding.  Cara Williams is also notable as the lonely female interest for Curtis, and for her importance as the driving force towards the film's conclusion.  Throughout the film, the direction by Stanley Kramer is without flaw, and the writing is first rate, especially in both the film's beyond excellent pacing and editing.  Still, in the end, and from beginning to end, this is the simply the best and most believable, moving work of both Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier, in any film either has/had ever done before or since.

Even though the DVD of this fantastic motion picture basically only contains the film itself, in this instance, that is quite enough because the film itself is just so good.  Though once one has seen this through to the end, and one knows the final outcome, it is still a film to be watched time and again, which makes the purchase of this, to true fans of the movie and its message, a must-buy if at least not a must-rent or at the very least glimpse on cable or TV.  It has various scenes and memorable lines from the two main protagonists, to keep one coming back to it now and then at the very least.  It is also consistently entertaining and involving, and really makes one think about the broader and deeper meanings and truths hidden just below the surface.  When the ""N"" word had some true meaning, and when post WWII later-day Eisenhower was struggling with the real problems of racial inequality.

This was, and remains, a film way, way, way ahead of its time in its socio-political views and consequences, and remains even more so after its 1985, rather tepid by comparison, TV-Movie remake.  While that version featured competent acting and direction, this is the original, and in stark, black and white (how fitting) cinematography, was back when it was originally released, and continues to be, a true winner on all fronts.

A lot of people, of all races and ethnic differences, can learn a lot from viewing this film, if their heart and basic consciousness/soul is in the right moral place.  While parts of the film (particularly the Curtis/Poitier sections) are more powerful and compelling than other parts of those who are chasing them down, overall, this movie to this day, is still perhaps the best black/white relations work ""Hollywood"" has ever produced.  The fact that it was done so in the late 50's, is truly amazing.

""Bowlin' Green, Sewin' Machine"" Sidney's ""Cullen"" character sings, at the beginning and at the end.  It's all a matter of experience, life experience, and learned views and traits from such, and environmental upbringings.  At the very end, which some find too jarring and abrupt, but which I find perfect, this simple song/hymn finds new meaning and importance.  For it brings the film and the viewer's experience of the film, full circle.  Because in the end, the ""chains"" that bind our blind hatreds, are all in our heads, and that which makes us the same, and allies against injustices ""under the law"" and any other unjust socio-political forces beyond our individual control, is so much more important and meaningful.

One of the best films I've ever seen, and though I know every heartbeat of it, my heart remains unhardened to its underlying message of hope and racial brotherly love and understanding/cooperation.  We shall overcome, someday...",1190073600,3,5506,4.953260869565217
810628,5,6304196903,"Another of maverick producer/director Stanley Kramer's consciousness-raising social films, this tale proved a potent metaphor for race relations in 1958. Virtually simultaneous with the rise of the civil-rights movement, this progressive adventure eloquently presented the case for racial harmony in the story of a gutsy prison-break film. Poitier--who at age 30 was set to go where no black actor had gone before--more than holds his own with Curtis, then a big star, who plays the despicable ""Joker"" to perfection.",1182816000,2,516,5.544303797468355

810630,5,6304196903,"The Defiant Ones is one of the great American films. Released in 1958, this starkly filmed story of two convicts on the run for their freedom evokes powerful emotions for the viewer. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are wonderful in their roles and display a level of screen chemistry that has been sadly lacking in contemporary films. It is hard to say which one is better due to their very different but equally powerful performance. As one might expect, the two cons start out hating each other, but slowly develop a grudging respect for one another as they learn about the others life and eventually a kind of friendship is formed. The secondary story concerns the posse on their trail and the friction that develops amongst them as the chase goes on. Cara Williams is memorable as the woman that Curtis cares for while on the run and is the character that causes a change in his attitude that leads directly to the bittersweet ending. Theodore Bikel is also very accomplished as the beleagered Sheriff and Lon Chaney Jr. is very good as a townsman who has a special reason for aiding the 2 cons in their escape.  The Defiant Ones is a great film that almost 50 years later still prods us with the reminder that YES, WE CAN learn to overcome our differences over race and live with and care for each other. Both Curtis and Poitier are at the top of their game here and each received an Academy Award nomination deservedly. A final note: watch the last scene and decide for yourself- was it an accident or did one friend make a sacrifice for another?",1126137600,30,1551,4.559139784946237
810631,3,6304196903,"The Defiant Ones

The opening scenes show a dark and stormy night, and a truck running down the highway. Inside are some prisoners. An accident occurs, and two prisoners escape. The Sheriff arrives at the scene, and some volunteers come to help. One has a modern portable transistor radio. They await the bloodhounds, and the prisoner's laundry for their scent. The dog handler has brought Dobermans to run with the bloodhounds. The Sheriff wants the dogs kept on a leash (SOP).

The two prisoners, white and black, have contending opinions and interests. Chained together, they must learn to cooperate. The actions of the Deputy Sheriff could serve as a tutorial for a manhunt in the wilderness. The pair cross the rapids; no dogs can follow their scent now. But this old, old trick will only delay good dogs as they search the banks. When they rest at night, hunting goes on by other animals. The next night they arrive at a company town, and break into a store. People hear the noise, and capture them. Since one of the villagers was hurt, the townsmen plan to lynch them. A conflict among the townsmen saves their lives; or was it the reward money? For some reason Big Sam lets them go (or the film would end too soon). Their interpersonal conflicts arise again; no stunt doubles were used. A young boy finds them, they find his home, and food from his single mother. A hammer and chisel breaks their bond, but Charlie falls ill. The Sheriff follows their trail to the turpentine camp, but the people there don't know nothing. Like some Big City? The film shows the characters of the rural poor, who can dream of a world they're never seen. The boy's Mom nurses Charlie, then chooses to leave with him. The Mom sends Color to the trackless swamp, but Charlie fights with her over this betrayal. [The son needed more target practice.] They try and fail to board an escape train, and listen to the baying of the hounds. The police trail them to the swamp. The Sheriff goes on ahead to capture them single-handedly (in time for his re-election).  They are caught after a long run.

It was a novel film that set a precedent. Its production values are similar to TV dramas of that era. The scenes in the film suggest an origin in a stage play. This monochrome film was produced and directed by Stanley Kramer. Its moral is how different interests can bond together when facing a common foe; nothing radical here.",1117756800,2,2411,4.626168224299065

(the bloodhounds did sound real, though.)

nonetheless, i give it 3 stars because this exercise in (supposed) 'social realism' is about something other than sex and violence.

well, at least it isn't about sex.

okay, not explicitly so.

besides, it's always fun to see character actors from that era, like Claude Akins and Lon Chaney, Jr, even with the volume muted to escape the jarringly false-sounding accents of their fellow performers.

of course, Sidney Poitier (with or without audio) makes the other leading players seem like students doing summer stock (not that they needed his help to do so).  but then, that's why Sidney Poitier is Sidney Poitier.

Sidney Poitier whom my mother always talked about when I was a kid and insisted that I and my sibling watched his movies, is magnificent.  He is such a charismatic, beautiful graceful man even when portraying a convict.  I remember getting angry watching this because of the racism, hatred and ignorance it portrayed.  Yet like all great Hollywood movies there is a real catharis at the end when the Curtis character will not betray his partner in chains, now his equal and friend.  I am sure that when it was made in the late 50's/ this film was bold in its subject matter, yet today in most civilised societies thoughts of difference should never cross our minds, but I am sad to report it often does, so this great movie even though it is a (plot formulaic set piece) is still relevant today in it overall message.",1115856000,4,952,4.543859649122807
