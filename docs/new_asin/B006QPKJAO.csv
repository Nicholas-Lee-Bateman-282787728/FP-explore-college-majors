8503068,5,B006QPKJAO,"I was in search of a source of factual information about Ninjutsu and traditional Budo, not a ramped-up, Hollywood action ninja thriller. And that's exactly what I got with The Gift Of Traditional Martial Arts. The Gift is a documentary produced by The International Genbukan Ninpo Bugei Federation, founded by the Grand Master Shoto Tanemura, one of three recognized schools of traditional Ninja and Samurai combat arts currently operating in Japan, This DVD shares the personal accounts of several Genbukan students and the benefits each has reaped as a student of these arts. Also shown are examples of realistic training sessions between Tanemura and some of his senior students. For anyone seeking facts and inspiration, The Gift Of Traditional Martial Arts is a must-have!",1387497600,,778,5.282258064516129

It makes a refreshing change to see the compassionate and empathetic values which many martial artist hold true, but rarely feel courageous enough to publically express.",1372636800,,331,5.509803921568627
8503071,1,B006QPKJAO,"This video has hardly anything to do with Ninjas and butt-kicking but is more or less a new-age, zen-religious documentary video.  I was lured in by the picture of the ninja delivering a Chi punch to the abdomen so I expected some action but instead I sat through a boring documentary about salvation through zen.  Not my cup of tea, sorry.",1364515200,,340,4.557377049180328
