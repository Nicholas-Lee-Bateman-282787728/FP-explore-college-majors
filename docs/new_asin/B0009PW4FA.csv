Tupac Forever.",1305331200,6,151,5.333333333333333

8065238,5,B0009PW4FA,"So excited about this, I love Tupac!",1416700800,,36,4.285714285714286
8065239,1,B0009PW4FA,I wanted to see actual movie videos of his rap shown on TV and this was about people being interviewed discussing his life. It was really disappointing.,1397606400,,152,4.666666666666667
8065240,5,B0009PW4FA,"Great set for any collector or fan. Not the highest quality, but nothing to complain about. I bought this for my daughter to add to her Tupac collection and she was very happy with it. The price is great. Buying them separate costs a lot more than the set of 3. It gives you a look into his life as well as stories/info from friends etc. Some info is already included in other dvd's or documentaries that you may have seen, but we have found that there are always a few new tidbits and extra glimpses into his life in each movie or documentary out there about him.",1385078400,,564,4.231481481481482
8065241,5,B0009PW4FA,"While the only DVD worth this purchase was Before I Wake, I bought it because I'm a major 2Pac fan.  Why not have 3 poorly made movies about 2Pac where you might hear a story you never did before.  For $15 I did.  Brand new and now mine, happy buyer.",1374883200,,250,3.96
8065242,1,B0009PW4FA,"I just opened my purchase and I was supposed to receive Before I Wake, Thug Immortal, and Tupac VS. What I ACTUALLY received was Thug Immortal, Tupac VS., and Welcome To Death Row (Signature Series). Lmao! What is crazy is my second order that came on the same day was Welcome To Death Row! Two out of three isn't bad but it is still unacceptable. Before I Wake is $12.99 separately. I pay for only what I want and two out of three is NOT what I paid for. What am I going to do with an extra copy of Welcome To Death Row? Sheesh.",1363132800,,529,4.0476190476190474
8065243,5,B0009PW4FA,"but my teenager will love this set!  He is very into rap, where is began, where it's going, and Tu Pac is one of his favorites.  I know he is going to be a happy kiddo when he opens this Christmas gift.",1354579200,,202,3.7857142857142856
8065244,5,B0009PW4FA,Excellent Product / Excellent Documentaries / Awesome depiction of a Career cut too short / Talent long gone / Musical Genius and Acting Talent far surpasses other Rap Stars....,1344470400,3,177,5.137931034482759
8065245,5,B0009PW4FA,"This is exactly what I expected and a great addition to my collection of Tupac merchandise!! I am extremely pleased with this item and the super fast shipping, I would definitely order from this seller again!",1342137600,3,208,4.805555555555555
