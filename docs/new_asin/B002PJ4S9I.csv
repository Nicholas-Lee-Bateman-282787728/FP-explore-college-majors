8377057,5,B002PJ4S9I,I love this video. Nanna's technique and philosophy is so unique and simple. She removes the mountain that we create when we think we need to know everything. She simplifies belly dance and shows you what you can do when you learn to do one movement really well. Then she pairs it with another simple movement. This video is challenging in that it has fast transitions and deep muscle movements. (Nanna works from the deeper set of muscles in the abdomen). I really love this artist and this video is one of the best on drum solos that i have seen. It is simple yet challenging and exciting to watch. I look forward to more videos from Nanna. This is a wonderful dvd for all levels of belly dancers.,1308182400,3,699,4.426356589147287
8377058,5,B002PJ4S9I,Very easy to follow. Nanna teaches with care and without the self conscious theatrics of so many other bellydance teachers. She is an amazing dancer and a great teacher. You will learn to belly dance with this DVD.,1286755200,2,214,4.657894736842105
8377059,3,B002PJ4S9I,I would give this DVD 5 stars if music CD would be in the package. I live outside US and for me it is almost impossible to purchase the music for this choreography. If for some reason it is not legal to have a music CD for the choreography in the same package then music should be available for purchase from the same source as DVD. Otherwise the whole choreography DVD concept is useless. I can learn it but can't perform it.,1285113600,2,426,4.2073170731707314
8377060,4,B002PJ4S9I,"I would have rated this one 5 stars if not for the purple back on the disc, sometimes those won't play in my dvd player.  So far so good though.

I do like the dvd and intend to keep it, she exhibits a pleasant video personality and well above average teaching technique.  I would certainly seek her out for lessons in person if geography would allow it.

If your looking for a drum solo dance that's a bit different than the others on the market these days.  Look no further and give this one a whirl.  I doubt you'll regret it.",1257033600,8,529,4.188118811881188
