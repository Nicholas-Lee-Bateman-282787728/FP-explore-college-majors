8761150,3,B01FNCFNTW,"Filmed at a Lincoln Log cabin, near Leighton, Pa. (They really do have cell phone reception there.) Grant (Matthew Wise) is marrying Sarah (Clea Alsip) who learned to act by attending the Eve Plumb School of Fine Arts. Also in attendance is Dani (Nicole Pacent) a rival she didn't know about. It doesn't take long before our Cabin the Woods film dials into a slasher who-dun-it with all the characters/suspects apparently accounted for during the second murder, so I selected ""other"" which was wrong.

What made the film enjoyable was an early scene where the wrong person got the prize. I'm not sure how possible that was either. After that scene, the film's humor tapered off and so did the movie. The characters suddenly became shallow.

2 1/2 STARS Disclaimer: I lived in that neck of the woods.
