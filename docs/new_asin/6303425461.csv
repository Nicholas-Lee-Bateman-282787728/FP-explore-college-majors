7846427,1,6303425461,"Review of The Gathering Storm
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

TV movies often get a bad rap. Some of them are very good. But there was a slew of really terrible ones to give them such a terrible reputation, and The Gathering Storm was one of them. Richard Burton plays Winston Churchill, but unlike other people who attempt over-the-top Churchill impressions, Burton just sounds like himself.

The script is as boring as the plot, which follows Churchills political role in the years leading up to WWII. I actually couldn't get through the entire thing. Much of the movie was fast-forwarded, but I didn't escape without suffering through a ridiculously campy temper tantrum from Ian Bannen as Hitler. The movie ends with a very tired sounding Victory at all costs speech. Im pretty sure any other Churchill movie would be better than this one, so take your pick.",1500595200,,861,4.8108108108108105

However, Richard Burton seemed repeatedly far too hesitant in speaking the part, without enough emphasis in comparison to much footage of the real Churchill, whereas Finney did not hesitate and also was able to capture in sound the cadence of Churchill's speech pattern. Churchill was a bulldog throughout a period where he was taking a beating, and he remained enough of a bulldog to carry his country through the many hard times of the war. His character was not a hesitant one.

Whatever the reasons were at the time the 1970's version was made, Burton also was far less portly than the character of Churchill, and in that respect Finney also was more true to the real Churchill.

I would like to see Finney, Redgrave and the other members of the cast do a sequel, and would recommend the later version also for the inobtrusive and lovely background introduction to Chartwell.",1285459200,5,1144,4.856410256410256
7846430,3,6303425461,"This 1974 made for TV movie stars Richard Burton as Winston Churchill. This is the first film titled ""The Gathering Storm"" another  film was later released with the same title. They are both UK/US co-productions.  I believe this film with Burton to be superior mostly because of his performance of the British leader. It was also known as ""A Walk with Destiny"". It played on British BBC TV and on ABC here in the US. However, this film is NOT available yet on DVD. I don't believe either here or in the UK. The feature is 72mins long and well worth viewing for either biography buffs or used as an educational tool in class.

The Gathering Storm chronicles the days of Churchill prior to WWII. It deals with the pre war years. A crucial time in British history from 1936-1940. Churchill had already began to lay the ground work that would lead the allies to victory against Nazi German in WWII. The movie concentrates on Churchill's rise from obscurity to becoming the Prime Minister of Great Britain in one of its most important points in history.

The rest of the cast also delivers great performances. Especially a young Patrick Stewart from ""Star Trek"" fame who plays Clemet Atlee. Virginia McKenna plays Clemmie Churchil. Ian Bannen is rather an odd Adolf Hitler,  but he makes it work.

The 2002 TV movie of the same title with Albert Finney is more focused on the love story between Winston and Clemmie. This original '74 movie is deals more with the politics and history of the man who did indeed have a date with destiny. Make sure to check this video out when you get a chance. - sideshowvideo",1210204800,2,1603,4.607017543859649
7846431,5,6303425461,"From 1936-40, Winston Churchill found few supporters in Parliament when he warned against Hitler and predicted his invasion of most of Europe.  Britain, following the policies of Stanley Baldwin and then Neville Chamberlain, believed that Hitler was less threatening than a Communist dictator would have been in Germany and that he could be taken at his word not to invade other countries.  In short order, however, Hitler retook the Rhineland from France, ""rejoined"" Austria with the German ""fatherland,"" and partitioned Czechoslovakia, with no international interference.

Although Britain and France belatedly guaranteed Poland's safety, Hitler ignored them, confidently marching into Poland.  Britain declared war, and within minutes, air raid sirens were sounding in London.  Winston Churchill, who had warned against Hitler for four years, was appointed Lord of the Admiralty.

Directed by Herbert Wise, this historically accurate, seventy-two-minute film (1974) is filled with the resonant speeches of Churchill to Parliament and government ministers, and reveals the internal political conflicts leading to Britain's declaration of war on Germany.  Richard Burton, thrilling to watch as Churchill, uses his stentorian voice and imposing presence to convey the heart of the man who, just before war was declared, had furiously exclaimed, ""We have sustained a total and unmitigated defeat without a war!""  His determination to win the war at all costs, and his arguments with both the Foreign Office and the Treasury further emphasize the government's residual uncertainties about the sacrifices necessary to win.  When Chamberlain is finally asked to resign as Prime Minister, King George VI appoints Churchill, who says that all he can offer is ""Blood, toil, tears, and sweat.""

The supporting cast is outstanding, with Virginia McKenna as the beautiful and supportive Clemmie Churchill, Robert Hardy as an appropriately smarmy von Ribbentrop, and Ian Bannen as the explosive Adolph Hitler.  Although the VHS I watched had faded almost to black and white, I actually found this to be an advantage.  The resulting film more closely resembles the black and white newsreels of the time, and the actors have the look and feel of real historical figures as we have seen them in period films and photographs.  Filled with details about the political interactions which led to the declaration of war, including Neville Chamberlain's decline of an early offer of help from the United States, this is a memorable film which shows just how close Europe came to having national boundaries permanently changed.
