October 1993, I returned to the states after completing a Voice of America Relay Station construction project in Selebi-Phikwe, Botswana.

I had considered staying in the country nestled in between Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, but chose not to. Instead I returned to Oregon to start a bakery.

However, almost as if some TV producer had tapped into my brainwaves, I discovered a TV Series running on, I think, the Fox network some years later. It may have been in reruns or may have been a new series, I don't recall. What I do recall, though, is that the series was filmed on location.

I was watching an episode wherein I said to my wife, if I didn't know better, they're about to come into some elephants and, indeed, they did. The end credits confirmed the show was shot on location at Mashatu Game Preserve, Botswana.

Viewing this series was like being back in Botswana. The plot is more of a family show, instead of on the order of Dallas (remember Steve Kanaly in Dallas?) but it is one of the rare adventure TV series to have been aired in any decade.

To my mind, this is the best TV series for any family keen to watch adventure programming.",1419206400,3,1180,4.516431924882629
