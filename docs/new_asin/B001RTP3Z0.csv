3779934,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I agree 100 percent with Mr Innes' review. This is a fantastic performance of the artist with a terrific band and excellent backup singers in a once-in-a-lifetime concert for dvd. I have been waiting for something like this for a long time. The only other performance video I have ever seen was a longtime ago on Austin City Limits in black and white. If I am unable to ever see him in person, then this will be a fine substitute-maybe there will be a blue-ray version of this",1239235200,2,476,4.420454545454546
3779935,4,B001RTP3Z0,"Leonard Cohen has always been a unique performer. Sort of an enigma in real life with a talent that cannot be denied. Live in London filmed on July 17, 2008 at the O2 Arena presents the man at his very best.

Performing witha spot on nine member band and looking a very dapper 75 years young, Cohen gives a very appreciative audience a performance that served as a great retrospective of his now four decades plus career. Filmed in closeups that focus on the band and not on the audience by Edward Sanders, Cohen is in top form as he performs standards like Bird on a Wire, Everybody Knows,Hallelujah, I'm Your Man, and Closing Time. There is not one slow moment in the entire two hour and thirty nine minute performance.

This is a show that was well worth waiting for and well worth purchasing. The only DVD extra is a copy of the song lyrics but really that is all that was needed.",1238803200,7,884,4.384146341463414
3779936,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I swore I would not open this DVD until after seeing L. Cohen in Oakland the Monday after next. But I'm so glad I broke my vow.

This is one of the most wonderful concerts I've ever seen captured on DVD.
The band and Leonard's singers are top-notch, and one senses that they feel as though they are a part of something special.
The songs span nearly 40 years of a canon that is second to none.

Most amazing of all,though, is how a digital disc can cut through its own technology and exude so much warmth and passion.  Even when the camera shows a close shot of Cohen, one can still sense the warmth, love and admiration coming from the ecstatic London audience.

As for Leonard Cohen...if he were to do nothing but sing, that would be enough given the wonderful breadth of material performed at this concert.
However, his gentle and gracious command of the stage provides this show an added depth and dimension.  Within the span of minutes he can be hilarious, self-deprecating, humble, poignant, appreciative...and I could easily go on with the superlatives to describe his on-stage demeanor.

Very often I make a point of remembering to trust the art and not the artist.  In the case of Leonard Cohen, I tend to trust both.  His warmth seems genuine.  Unlike so many of his stature, his humility comes across as real.  His spoken words are every bit as powerful as those that are sung.  Given the way that the barriers are broken down between the singer and the band and the audience...to the point where it feels as though they are all part of one celebratory evening...such humility, graciousness and warmth cannot be anything but genuine.

The highlights are too many to mention:  ""Suzanne"" sounds as fresh as it did 40 years ago.  ""Anthem"" sounds more urgent today than when it was first penned.  ""The Future"" & ""First We Take Manahattan"" are even more biting now in the 21st Century than when they were first penned.  Cohen's increased age gives songs such as ""Boogie Street,"" ""Tower of Song,"" & ""Democracy"" a world weariness that makes these songs all the more penetrating.  His lovely ""If It Be Your Will"" sounds as much like a prayer as it does one of the loveliest songs ever written.  If I don't stop now, I'll wind up writing accolades about every song on this DVD. Yes, it is that wonderful!

I've been fortunate to see so many of the greats in my lifetime - legends whose works will be remembered for decades to come.  Some have been surly and stand-offish. Others have been appreciative and welcoming toward their audience.

It is refreshing to see the best of everything embodied in this Leonard Cohen concert.  Songs that are amongst the best ever written, still performed with a passion (as well as with the added wisdom that comes from Cohen being 74 years young), with a band & audience & singer all equally committed to one another.

There are moments when I laughed out loud at Leonard's deadpan, wry humor.  There were times when tears welled in my eyes from the sincerity of the words that came out of his mouth, either spoken or in song.

In a day and age where so much seems packaged and perfunctionary, it is refreshing to see & hear someone such as Cohen whose observations can warm the heart or cut like a knife to get to the heart of a matter.  He is the real deal.  No airs, no faux modesty...just a man with four decades' worth of majestic material, with an excellent band whose respect for Cohen is reciprocated by their singer with his respect for their talents & abilities, along with a genuine warmth & sense of humanity that allows Leonard Cohen to turn a large London venue into a setting that is as intimate as being in one's living room.

Without a doubt, one of the finest, most moving and most satisfying concert DVDs I've ever seen.

I'm glad that I opened this prior to April 13.  Seeing this makes me look forward to seeing Cohen in a small Oakland theater even more so than I already was.

However, had I not been fortunate enough to have gotten a ticket for his upcoming concert, I have to say that this DVD would have been a more than fine consolation.  It is worth every cent.  The staging, lighting, musicianship, song selection and sound are painstakingly stellar, obviously  given great care & much thought.

This is a true gem, a most worthy representation of one of the greatest songwriters of our time.",1238544000,223,4359,4.566280566280566
3779937,4,B001RTP3Z0,"Leonard Cohen commands attention for the entire concert, which is amazing considering his 74 years.  He is warm, humorous and humble to his audience and hardly makes an error in presenting over 40 years of his music.

Cohen looks and speaks like a benevolent Tony Bennett-like figure who beams at his audience after each song and clutches his hat to his chest like an ageing grandfather greeting cherished old friends at a local bus stop.

His backing musicians and female vocal group are top-notch as well.

On the down side, the technical production is disappointing.  For what would have to contend as THE concert event of the decade, the presentation in 4:3 format with a picture that could be described as analog quality at best is hardly acceptable in 2009, especially when it was recorded just last July.

The camera work is often sloppy and unimaginative.  The continuity editing is the same.

But full marks to Cohen and his band for a performance that has to be seen as well as heard.  Others have used the words ""beautiful"", ""warm"", ""gracious"", ""amazing"", ""joyful"" and ""sublime"".  I can not disagree with any of that.

Regrettably, the DVD version has not done this major musical milestone the justice it warrants but it is still worth it.",1238284800,72,1250,4.821596244131455

Typical of Cohen's hypnotic poetry, it slips sideways into your inner ear. And straight to your heart, bypassing your unreliable brain.

The back up musicians are of a high.order, and Cohen prowls the stage like a nimble panther.

3780189,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I was a disc jockey in the early 60's and have a very eclectic taste in music, (I like everything), and have heard the name Leonard Cohen a couple of times from aficionados of his music.  Finally, the other day, Alex Trebek commented oh Jeopardy how great his music was so I bought the DVD and CD of his ""Live in London"" concert.

WOW!  It reminded me of listening to a folk music concert done by people like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seegur, and yes, Peter, Paul, & Mary.

Oh, and I'm a ballad freak too!

This was one of the best albums I've ever acquired, and a waayyy too late discovery of a tremendous talent.",1401753600,,608,4.252173913043478
3780190,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Yes I will agree that this is not the best recording as far as quality of the picture. The sound is very good. Mr Leonard is a performer for adults. His songs capture life and as a listener you are able to relate to his music. Although he is not the household name of other ""big stars"" of the past decades Mr Cohen's songs take a back seat to no one. It is fun to watch him perform his songs with the same passion he had when he wrote them many years ago. He is a humble yet brilliant man. If you enjoy music for grown ups then you will enjoy Mr Leonard Cohen. He has become one of my all time favorites.",1399766400,,604,3.9186991869918697

3780192,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Have always loved Leonard Cohen's music; his amazing voice, the lyrics and musicians that perform with him for this concert have graced us with a once in a lifetime experience. He's just gotten better over time. To realize he has completed over 200 concerts in his mid 70's is inspiring. After five years living in a Zen monastery only to come back to his civilian life and discover that his manager had embezzled his lifetime savings; he has out of necessity rekindled his music career with new works and given his fans the opportunity to enjoy his talent many times over. Those of us who have admired his work are truly fortunate to be here during his lifetime.

As to the DVD recording of the concert, the sound quality and video are excellent. The musicians on guitar, laud, banduria, archilaud, wind instruments and percussion are superb. The background vocals  with Sharon Robinson and the Webb sisters are sublime. Bravo! A great concert!",1395360000,3,945,4.827160493827161

3780271,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Of course which DVDs are among the best depends on the music you prefer.
I know Leonard Cohen very well, but have none of his CDs in my vast collection.
Maybe I have heard his songs too often - sung both by him and so many others.
But this DVD brings together elements whose sum is vastly more than all of it parts.
First there is Cohen. Warm and humble and in great voice with perfect timing despite his 74 years.
Then there are the musicians, several of which play multiple instruments in the course of the concert.  And varied they are: the melodica, clarinet, sax and mouth harp by just one of them. Add to that an auto harp, Portuguese guitar, mandolin and an array of electric and acoustic gutiars and other instruments.
Thirdly, the three back up singers are sublime indeed.
Leonard's pleasure in their brilliance is palpable.
He is great at selecting great back up singers.  First Jennifer Wearnes, then Perl Batalia and Julia Stephenson and now the young Webb sisters and Leonard's collaborator in recent years Sharon Robinson. They elevate Leonard's baritone into a realm of complex polyphony worthy of the finest madrigals.
What a perfect complement Sharon is to the Webb sisters' ethereal harmonies, not to mention her own great solos.
And finally, the sound is great and the photography excellent and of high quality in my opinion considering it is filmed on a dark stage.
Most of all I like that the camera lingers not only on Leonard, but also on each of the musicians and especially the three back up singers.
You just don't see that on most concert DVDs.",1374364800,,1571,4.667870036101083
3780272,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I saw part of this concert on PBS and that viewing prompted me to buy him.  I chose the DVD over the CD's because I also liked his band a lot and really enjoyed watching them play.

I hadn't realized Mr. Cohen wrote so many songs that I know.  Even in his senior years he sings so intimately and is able to keep ypu in the palm of his hand..  I found him to be VERY entertaining.  Same for the backup sngers and the band.  I'm really glad I purchased this DVD.

And I adored the hats.",1374278400,2,484,3.9278350515463916

3780274,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I first saw this on cable, though I was not able to see the whole thing.  So I ordered it from Amazon.  As I said it was a great introduction to Leonard Cohen.
I had never heard of him or his music before.  To say the least I was mesmorised.
I watched it once and then watched for a second time right away!
I then ordered the CD, I was that impressed by it.  It is fantastic, the music is well done, I have always liked music that has a lot of bass to it.  You are drawn into his music right from the beginning.
one night I needed to get away from things for a while, so I took out my DVD, it snapped much to my dismay!  I ordered another DVD right away.  And had to listen to the CD.  So not all was lost.
I'd like to see more of his concerts on DVD.

3780288,5,B001RTP3Z0,"This DVD along with the tribute DVD ""I'm Your Man"" caused me to buy the Complete Studio Albums Box Set of the first 11 studio albums, his newest CD, 4 documentaries, and a live DVD/CD!  I like that the insert provides which album the songs are from (thus the purchase of the Box Set, as he covers songs from nearly every studio album on this DVD.)  I had the ""Best of"" and ""More Best of"" CD's, but now I want to hear everything.  I actually prefer his voice and performance at 73 than when he first started, for instance the performance of Bird on the Wire and Suzanne on this DVD are both better than on the original albums, due to the great band, back-up singers and Leonard's voice has gotten better.  I find a lot of concert videos get a little boring, but this one held my interest to the end, probably due to the complex and thoughtful lyrics by Leonard and the great performance by all involved.  I very much liked that he gave attribution to everyone in the band (twice) by the end of the concert, including his writing collaborator, Sharon Robinson.  This DVD definitely made me want to delve deeper into the works of Leonard Cohen.",1366675200,,1141,4.40952380952381

Although this recording is from 2008, it is not dated.  It has the feel of a 2013 concert- an older, pensive, somewhat resigned, Leonard Cohen  This is not a recording that you will listen to once and then put away.

Mostly, I prefer to listen to my music, not watch it.  But in this case, the London 2008 concert video is way better than any of the audio-only sources for this music at this time in Leonard's life.  And you don't have to sit still to watch it; it makes great listening while working or dining.

The disc isn't perfect.  The quality of the photography is very poor, especially at the beginning.  There doesn't seem to have been any attempt to adapt the stage lighting to the needs of the filming.  I don't know if one gets used to, or it improves throughout the concert; it didn't seem to bother me so much toward the end.

The concert is a little long.  We probably will never do it in one sitting again.  But that's okay.  I'm confident that we will play it a lot in the days to come, even if only parts of it at a time.",1361491200,,1031,4.1725888324873095

This DVD is the culmination of a lifetime of creating truly original music.  I also bought Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.

3780356,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Everything about this concert casts a spell.  The lighting is so warm that every instrument and face and fabric seems rich beyond probability.  The camera closes in on each with an intimacy I've never experienced in a filmed concert, from the musicians, who play some instruments new to me, to the beautiful blend of the voices, both Cohen's and his three female backup singers.

It's unusual to see a singer/songwriter still performing at this age, which must be over 80, but his voice has aged like good wine.  I understand that when he went into a monastery a few years back, his agent ran off with all his money.  True or not, we are beholden that Cohen is still singing.  And he is clearly delighted to be before a full, enthusiastic house, most of whom seem to be several generations his junior.  (At one point, he refers to something that happened when he was 60 --""just a crazy kid with a dream."")

If you're a longtime fan, all of your favorites are sung here -- plus some recent you may not have heard; Cohen is ever-evolving.  The concert, like the camera, takes its time, and they're brought back for many, many encores. This DVD includes the lyrics to most of the songs, which is a boon when you find yourself singing them for days afterwards.  The first of Cohen's songs I remember hearing was ""Suzanne"", and I'm most grateful that I now have the lyrics to refer to. For me, the man is first and foremost a poet, but the melodies are enchanting, and you would never mistake any of them for anyone else's.",1323734400,,1518,4.507299270072993

Since then we watch this video every few months to relish in the memory of the two magical nights......  Our only regret is that he didn't include ""famous blue raincoat"" or ""joan of arc"" or maybe ""because of a few songs"".  Leonard sings poetry.  I can't describe it in any other way. He is just amazing and this is the closest that most of you will ever come to experiencing ""Leonard"".",1316476800,,566,4.212962962962963

3780370,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Unlike Bob Dylan, his only rival as the greatest songwriter/poet to emerge in the 1960s, Leonard Cohen is an affable sort, prefacing his songs with remarks to the audience whom he calls ""friends."" While glum Bob acts like he's making a sacrifice by appearing before his fans, Cohen thanks them for ""keeping my songs alive"" and says, ""We're honored to play for you tonight."" He jokes with them in his witty, self-deprecating way. In Leonard Cohen Live in London, taped at the O2 Arena on July 17, 2008, he recalls that he was 60 when he last played London, ""just a kid with a crazy dream.""

And the crowd loves him, cheering enthusiastically, and roaring their approval when, in his raspy baritone, he sings those lines from 1988's ""Tower of Song"":

  ""I was born like this, I have no choice,
  I was born with the gift of a golden voice.""

Cohen's voice IS golden, and the songs are magnificent. He performs 24 of them in this concert, all but one from his selective pen. Most of his signature works are here - ""Suzanne,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Take This Waltz,"" ""Hallelujah,"" ""Sisters of Mercy"" (but not, alas, my favorite, ""Joan of Arc"") - songs whose melancholy tone nonetheless have a calm, soothing effect, the perfect antidote to a world that, as Cohen observes, ""is plunged in darkness and chaos."" Hallelujah, indeed!

Cohen is also kind to his collaborators, introducing his band and backup singers several times, and highlighting their exceptional work even during the songs (""Dino Soldo on the saxophone,"" he points out midway through ""Bird on the Wire,"" and ""Javier Mas on the archilaud"" before Cohen has even sung a note of ""Who By Fire"").

I'll always rank Cohen's October 1988 appearance on PBS's Austin City Limits above any other live performances since it was then that I was formally introduced to this incomparable artist (and when will that glorious hour be released on DVD?), but Leonard Cohen Live in London is outstanding. This is a moment in time to be cherished, now and in the future, when, to paraphrase the man himself, we ache in the places where we used to play. If possible, his voice and music will resonate even stronger then, and heal the most battered heart and soul. I love you, Leonard.

Is this the wonder of age, the fruit of experience paid for in the currency of time on this earth. Leonard and his chosen musicians are obviously at the highest level. In a world so youth orientated it is so refreshing to see the wisdom and maturity of age that so few manifest. Poetry and story telling set to great and diverse music that so perfectly fits does it for me, and what about the women's voices and presence - hallelujah!

3780392,5,B001RTP3Z0,"An amazing document, recorded mid-July, 2008 in London, when Leonard Cohen was doing a world tour. He was only 73 years old. And so, despite long years of semi-retirement, and many more spent on Mount Baldy becoming a Zen monk, he still came out and gave us his beautiful songs in that great virtuosic touring way where he was a ringmaster of an army of splendid musicians. We see this treatment from godfathers like David Gilmour and David Bowie, but Leonard Cohen has been doing it for many more years than those fellows and it's incredible to behold. Cohen and his band play two sets - the first one is 57 minutes long, the second one is one hour, 40 minutes long (actually, the second set is one hour long, and the encores are another 40 minutes long). Cohen has so many amazing songs that the stream of major classics just goes on and on, until way, deep in the set when he plays ""Take This Waltz,"" which probably not one of his recognised classics. The production is rich and full, making it quite different from the ""Field Commander Cohen: Tour Of 1979' release, which is spare by comparison, focussing on acoustic guitar, duets with Jennifer Warnes, violin solos from Raffi Hakopian, and jazzy fretless bass.

His entire set Live in London is spotless, with the only real comparisons his amazing tours of the past. In this case, he starts his London set off with the words ""Thank you so much, friends, so very kind of you to come to this...,"" he's drowned out in applause, and then the band kicks in to ""Dance Me To The End Of Love"", with its electric clarinet, three backup singers, and the weird motions of 12-string guitarist Javier Mas (who also breaks out the banduria, laud, archilaud and is full of dramatic gestures). Curtains setting the mood onstage. Leonard Cohen sings, passionately gripping the microphone. ""Thanks so much, friends. It's wonderful to be gathered here just on the other side of intimacy. I'm so pleased that you're here. I know some of you have undergone financial and geographical inconvenience. We're honoured to play for you tonight."" Breaks into ""The Future"", where he waters down the lyrics ""Give me crack and anal sex"" to ""Give me crack and careless sex"". He has fun with the lyrics ""white man dancing"", when he and the bass player do a little boogie, and when he alters a lyric ""white women dancing"", the two white backup singers (Charley and Hattie Webb, the Webb Sisters) do a little jig. ""It's been a long time since I stood on a stage in London. It was about 14-15 years ago, I was 60 years old, just a kid with a crazy dream. Since then, I've taken a lot of Prozac, Paxol, Wellbuttrin, Exexor, Ritalin; I've also studied TV and the philosophies and the religions, and cheerfulness kept breaking through. But I want to tell you something that will not easily be contradicted - there ain't no cure for love!"" Breaks into a great sax intro for a stunning version of ""Ain't No Cure For Love,"" followed by the best version of ""Bird on a Wire"" ever, toned down but with strong keyboards. This song, although it's vastly famous, has never been a favourite of mine; nevertheless, it's become gospel to the extent that I've met people who want these lyrics on their gravestones. Some drums and bass, swelling female backups, mandolin, great blues solo from Bob Metzger playing a semi-hollow body `72 Fender Telecaster Thinline. Sax solo.

The band plays ""Everybody Knows"", after which Cohen announces ""I wrote that song a long time ago with Sharon Robinson. More recently we wrote this one,"" and they play ""In My Secret Life"", a semi-duet between Cohen and Robinson, great blues guitars and organs, mild drums and bass; there's a two-minute Spanish archilaud intro for ""Who By Fire"", with its cool upright bass (great banging on the body for the outro bass roll), backup singer Hattie Webb on harp, Spanish solo on the larchilaud, a groovy organ solo, and Cohen plays the Godin classical guitar that is featured on the cover. Perfect - this has long been one of my favourite Cohen songs. He continues to play the Godin on ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye."" Great harmonica solo. Between-song banter is often a recitation of the vocals of the next song, and when he says ""there is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in,"" we know he's going to sing ""Anthem."" Great lyric - ""While the killers in high places say their prayers out loud."" It's the last song that they play before the intermission, although before they go offstage, Cohen introduces each of the members (he'd been doing it from time to time throughout the set as well).

After a break, they come out, and Cohen has a bit of an intro. ""I was having a drink with my teacher, he's 102 now. He was about 97 at the time. I poured him a drink, he clicked my glass and he said `excuse me for not dying.' (laughter) I kind of feel the same way. I want to think you, not just for this evening but for the many years you've kept my songs alive."" Starts up a Technics keyboard, sings ""Tower of Song"", with female backups. At his age, lyrics like ""I ache in the places I used to play"" probably have more meaning with each passing year. The song drones on at the end, with the backup singers going on and on with their ""da doo dum dum dum, da doo dum dum."" Cohen launches into a long spiel: ""Don't stop, don't leave me here alone, don't ever stop. Sing me to bed and sing me through the morning, because I'm so grateful to you because tonight it's become clear to me, tonight the great mysteries have unravelled and I've penetrated to the very core of things, and I have stumbled on the answer; and I'm not the sort of chap who would keep this to himself - do you want to hear the answer? Are you truly hungry for the answer? Then you're just the people I want to tell it to. Because it's a rare thing to come upon it, and I'll let you in on it now. The answer to the mysteries..."" and he makes a hand gesture towards the backup singers, ""...is `da doo dum dum...""

Cohen does a short Spanish intro to ""Suzanne"" on the Godin and sings that marvelous song. There's a great version of ""The Gypsy Wife"", with a stunning mandolin freakout, Cohen playing the Godin throughout. Female vocals start, Cohen comes in after one line. There's bass solo, but the camera has a lousy angle and we barely see it. Cohen and Robinson then launch in to ""Boogie Street"" (which, apparently, is named after a street in Singapore called Bugis Street -the local pronunciation of which sounds like ""Boogie Stree""). Robinson takes over several verses, with Cohen doing backup. ""Hallelujah"" is splendid, with a groovy organ solo. ""I'm Your Man"" has a cool electric clarinet solo. He then continues with a spoken word segment that becomes a long recital, accompanied by light organ swells, of the lyrics of an alternate version of ""A Thousand Kisses Deep"" that is titled ""Recitation W/N.L."":

You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat
You'd have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet
My mirrored twin, my next of kin, I'd know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in, a thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened, like a lily to the heat
You see, I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet
Who loved you with his frozen love, his second-hand physique
With all he is and all he was, a thousand kisses deep

I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high behind the veils of sheer deceit
Our perfect porn aristocrat, so elegant and cheap
I'm old, but I'm still into that, a thousand kisses deep

I'm good at love, I'm good at hate, it's in between I freeze
I've been working out, but it's too late, it's been too late for years
But you look fine, you really do, they love you on the Street
If you were here I'd kneel for you, a thousand kisses deep

The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye
A light that doesn't need to live and doesn't need to die
A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete
`Till witnessed here in time and blood, a thousand kisses deep

And I'm still workin' with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing `Auld Lang Syne"", but the heart will not retreat
I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep
But once or twice they let me play, a thousand kisses deep

I loved you when you opened, like a lily to the heat
You see - I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet
Who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique
With all he is and all he was, a thousand kisses deep

But you don't need to hear me now, and every word I speak
It counts against me anyhow, a thousand kisses deep.

Incidentally, that is transcribed from the video itself; the lyrics that are provided by the DVD itself are different:

Recitation W/N.L.

You came to me this morning
And you handled me like meat
You'd have to be a man to know
HOw good that feels how sweet
My mirror twin my next of kin
I'd know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in
A thousand kisses deep
I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
I'm just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet
Who loved you with his frozen love
His second-hand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep
I know you had to lie to me
I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high behind
The veils of sheer deceit
Our perfect porn aristocrat
So elegant and cheap
I'm old but I'm still into that
A thousand kisses deep
And I'm still working with the wine
Still dancind cheek to cheek
The band is plainy Auld Lang Syne
The heart will not retreat
I ran with Diz and Dante
I never had their sweep
But once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep
The autumn slipped across your skin
Got something in my eye
A light that doesn't need to live
And doesn't need to die
A riddle in the book of love
Obscure and obsolete
`Till witnessed here in time and blood
A thousand kisses deep
I'm good at love I'm good at hate
It's in between I freeze
Been working out but it's too late
It's been too late for years
But you look fine you really do
The pride of Boogie Street
Somebody must have died for you
A thousand kisses deep
I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
I'm just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet
But you don't need to hear me now
And every wort I speak
It counts against me anyhow
A thousand kisses deep.

A few changes: other than the order of the sections, he mentions specifically Boogie Street (Singapore's Bugis Street, which the song ""Boogie Street"" is supposedly named after, was in the past notorious for trans-sexual activity), and instead of ""Diz"" and ""Ray"", he talks about Diz and ""Dante."" Okay.

After that recitation, the most interesting original bit in the concert so far, the band breaks into ""Take This Waltz,"" a minor song from ""Various Positions"", and not really one of my favourites. But here it sounds lovely, brought out by great accompaniment from Hattie Webb, whose gorgeous voice is heavenly.

Cohen tries to take leave of the stage, and even gets the band off, but is quickly back for an encore that is to last nearly as long as the second half of the concert (providing a full third act, it seems). The band breaks into a jaunty version of ""So Long, Marianne"", then gets into a funky, waist-swinging ""First We Take Manhattan"". Starts off with funky bass intro, then gets intense with lots of energy and dancing. The Web Sisters come through again as great, great backups. ""Sisters of Mercy"" is very good, with a nice opportunity for another archilaud solo (in nearly three hours of live music, you're bound to get a few archilaud solos). To introduce ""If It Be Your Will"", one of Cohen's most beautiful songs, which he first sang with the sublime Jennifer Warnes, Cohen croaks out a verse or two before turning it over to the Webb Sisters, Charley working the mini-harp while Hattie takes the guitar (I think it's a Gibson acoustic, not sure). The women re-define the concept of vocal harmonies, it's stunning; and just to prove the point, when they finish their set, we get a shot of Cohen looking on, mesmerised. He snaps to it, and introduces ""Closing Time"", probably the funniest song he's ever written, and things get funky. He tries to make this his closing song (hint-hint), but all he does is run offstage and run back onstage again for a 10:30 version of ""I Tried To Leave You"" (hint-hint again), a gorgeous, undiscovered gem from ""New Skin For The Old Ceremony"". This song is littered with solos - a guitar solo immediately followed by a sax solo, then an organ solo, then a Sharon Robertson vocal bit flowering up the first verse of the song. This is followed by more archilaud from Javier Mas, then ""the sublime Webb Sisters"" doing their mmm mmm mmm, ha ha ha..., gettin' sexy `n' hot `n' heavy (most impressive), then a cool electric bass solo (first of the evening, remarkably), a light drum solo, then Cohen solos/improvs:

Goodnight my darlin'
I hope you're satisfied
The bed is kind of narrow
But my arms are open wide
Yes and here's a man, he's still working for your smile

The song winds down after that... and the guys all ome out from behind the instruments to sing ""Whither Thou Goest"" as a vocal version - Robinson and Cohen's voices come out clearest. The song lasts less than a minute, and the lyrics are:

Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge
Thy people shall be my people
Whither thou goest, I will go

At the end of the film, we get a single credit:

""Sincerely, L. Cohen"".

Awesome.

Only complaint - Cohen introduces the band members too many times. He's constantly adoring his band, his audience, and humbling himself; you're also dying to hear him say, after he's introduced the band, ""... and my name is Leonard Cohen."" What applause that would get! Instead, we get ""The sweet shepherd of stings, on the laud, Javier Mas; the master of breath on the instrument of wind, Dino Soldo; the signature of steady, on the pedal steel and the electric guitar, Bob Metzger; the prince of precision, our timekeeper - on the drums, Rafel Bernardo Gayol; on the Hammond B3 and the keyboards, the inpeccable Neil Larsen; my collaborator, the incomparable Sharon Robinson; Hattie and Charley Webb, the sublime Webb sisters; our guardian and sentry, the musical director on the upright and the electric bass, Roscoe Beck."" This is how he ends the concert (before the many encores), he did the same at the end of the first part.

Okay, maybe a few more complaints: the unnecessary mouth-harp solo in ""So Long, Marianne""; the song has become weirdly cheerful, while it was always sort of wistful, this cheapens it a bit. I was also disappointed to not hear ""The Story of Isaac"" in this concert - was it too much of a downer? But it's such a powerful song...",1281225600,8,14759,4.444937176644494

Never has there been such an entertainer, or gifted artist, in our lifetime! This Wonderful concert proves it!

One of the very finest and most lovely points of this concert is Leonard's humble and genuine heart-felt presentation, and love and regard for, his audience.

Do yourself a favor, pick this up, and treat yourself to one of the most wonderful ""concerts"" you have ever had the pleasure to ""attend""....it's worth the price of admission many times over!

The CD is pretty darned awesome, too, although the DVD allows you to see this great artist performing.

3780398,5,B001RTP3Z0,I first saw this DVD presented on a PBS station.  Even though they only played about one third of this DVD a few songs at a time with fund rising in between I knew that I had to get this DVD.  The next day I went to Amazon.com and bought it.  This is one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  Leonard's performance is absolutely riveting.  The reason for this I feel is the passion that he gives to the presentation of each song.  On one song he doesn't even sing it; he recites it like poetry which it is.  He is accompanied with a full band and backup singers which are all amazing artists and add to the performance if that is even possible.  I have watched this DVD many times now and have not yet tired of it.,1275609600,,716,4.028368794326241
3780399,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I am certainly old enough to be a Leonard Cohen fan, but never quite made the grade, only managing to own one album ""New Skin for the Old Ceremony"". During my early years of music appreciation I gave most of my time (and part of my hearing) to Led Zeppelin.

This is an excellent DVD, it somehow passes through the digital world and into your lounge, probably because of Leonard's ability to demonstrate that he is truly honoured and humble to be on stage.

It is not often that a music DVD captures the total attention and heart of my parrot. He just loves it, swaying gently to the music, captivated by the smooth backing band and the husky lyrics from Leonard Cohen.

I borrowed the DVD from a good friend, thought it would fill a small gap during a relaxing coffee by the fire one night. Instead it has become a new favourite and will necessitate a purchase for my own collection.

Thank you Leonard

it moves me to tears from time to time, and laughing in between.

The Musicians who play and sing with Leonard Cohen are nothing less than perfect!
Talk about a perfect match? - THIS is it! - They are all incredible artists in their own right!

Some of the words to a few of the songs are a little confusing for this Cohen newbie, but that doesn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this group of well seasoned artists, and their most perfect performances. - Make time to watch, and listen to this uninterrupted, as it is almost hypnotic, and compels one to stay put until the end.

The rendition of ""Hallelujah"" is well done by many artists, but to hear it from the man who wrote it,
play,and sing it, is truly music to the ears, and emotion to the eyes and mind!",1270512000,,807,4.296052631578948

3780405,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I found Cohen and friends' performances well done.  The band's presentation seemed a little sedate for my liking, as the original songs often had greater shifts in dynamics.  However, these performances stayed more or less mellow, with a jazzy feeling of understated rhythm and smooth interludes from the gifted backing musicians (the twins' incredible duet deserves special mention).  Cohen's voice lacked the grit that made his recorded voice so compelling, but he made up for his deadpan delivery with playful philosophizing between songs and a sincere delivery that underscored the profundity of his beautiful songs about love, sexuality, heartbreak, transcendence, and death.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who might appreciate an intimate reflection on life's limitations and freedoms, or even just a quiet evening of good music.",1268524800,,836,5.5078125

3780407,5,B001RTP3Z0,I saw Leonard around 1963 when he appeared @ UCLA. I was lucky enough to meet Leonard because an assertive friend of mine managed to get us back stage. I was dumbstruck. Leonard gave me a piece of 'Sees' candy which I kept for years & even considered having it bronzed. Eventually I ate it. I was in my early twenties at the time.  I saw Leonard again in 2009 when he appeared in San Diego.  I had no assertive friend and I was 64.  So imagine how delighted I was when Leonard spoke of the last time he appeared on stage when he was at 60 still a young man with a crazy dream! I love having the album to re-experience the laughter and the wisdom that Leonard Cohen has gifted us with through the years. In my book [ASIN:0892540885 Night Wings: A Soulful Dreaming and  Writing Practice}. I look at the prophetic and the mundane message of dreams.

They actually used these live video streams to make a DVD, which also explains the outdated 4:3 aspect ratio!! Incredible and annyoing!!!

Apart from that, for all of those who've been to Lenoard Cohen's 3-hour shows these past two years and for all of those who've missed it, this DVD is a real treasure to behold and to keep. Never has Mr. Cohen sounded better, backed up (as almost always) by a stellar backing band, including absolutely beautiful vocal harmonies by the amazing Webb Sisters from Britain and his long-time collaborator Sharon Robinson.

The sound back in the concert hall was brilliant, and this is pretty much what you get here on this DVD, no more, no less. As with with video quality, the sound on the DVD could have been so much better, but the performance and the music more than make up for the technical disappointments.",1264118400,,1083,4.6947368421052635

With a quiet salute of his hand and a warm smile he greets his audience with humor, recognition of their grasp of what he is about to perform and a humbleness that becomes a person who has lived hard and well in his 80 plus years.
  Then the marvelous orchestra begins with individual muscians thrilling all of the audiance with their perfect skill and magic sounds.  Mesmorized we listen to the gravity of the words he sings and knowingly nod our understanding of all he is teaching us. The DVD album is the best I have seen and leaves all who see it indelible musing long after having watched the performances.
  This performance by Leonard Cohen, his singers, (Manhattan Sisters of Mercy), and his outstanding Orchestra, is a magic musical experience you will play over and over again, marvaling at the total grasp of his muscianship.

3780443,5,B001RTP3Z0,"While there may not be a conveyance of dramatic videography, the concert was covered eloquently. I watched this before seeing LC live on this tour and after. I am so glad I bought the DVD because it takes me back to that night each and every time, which makes it most memorable and oustanding in my opinion. This man is a masterpiece himself. At 75, to even be doing what he is doing, (""If it be your will"", as he says) is nothing short of magnificent. I have not enough praise for Leonard Cohen and every member of the band. I have heard other singer/songwriters as they reach their golden years become rough voiced and out of tune. LC has done no such thing. I think he has actually gotten better with age and far prefer his depth of voice now to his earlier recordings.

The concert covers the majority of his greatest songs. Of course he could not cover them all in one concert. At the show I saw he actually did Chelsea Hotel in addition to the playlist shown. This concert runs 2.5 hours plus so you will definitly get your money's worth. Warm, humble, adoring of his back up singers the 'sublime' Webb Sisters, collaborator Sharon Robinson and other band members, Leonard pays tribute to them throughout the evening. They are each and every one a vital ingredient in the stupendous talent emanating from and creating the masterpiece which is this musical presentation.

This is a must have for any LC fan. LC does not fit into any genre, he creates his own and in my opinion, is the greatest lyricist and wordsmith of our time. Even my grandkids ( aged 5 & 2) are going around the house singing ""Hallelujah!"". It's good to know that they are being exposed to real music and something beyond the top 40 pop charts.

I was left speechless by the end of the show. This DVD is truly a masterpiece. The artistic depth on all levels is staggering... the wise old man with so much spirit pouring out of his soul, his band of visionaries creating such beautiful sounds around his poetry.

To hear this 75-year-old man and his excellent entourage go through so many of his masterpieces is an experience that has no equal. As good as Cohen is, to add the craftsmanship of the musicians behind him and the solos of Sharon Robertson and the Webb sisters is completion of a 2 1/2-hour work of art.

3780465,5,B001RTP3Z0,"I'm sure that most people know the story.  Leonard Cohen was retired and living in a monastery only to learn that he had no money through the machinations of his business manager.  So out of the monastery and onto the road to restore his finances.  I'm sorry for Leonard Cohen that he was forced to do something that he preferred not to, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't delighted that he went out on one long, perhaps final tour.  I got the CD version of this concert a day or so after it was released, but for some reason until now I did not get around to seeing the DVD version.  Musically there were no great revelations.  I already knew these performances very, very well.  But nonetheless it was delightful to see Cohen onstage.  On the album he sounded so amazingly charming; on the DVD he was if anything even more charming.  The one real surprise was seeing precisely how fragile he looked.  Not ill or sick or even especially old, just smaller and more fragile than I anticipated.

There is a great moment in one of the original Beavis and Butthead cartoons.  They are watching a Johnny Cash video when one of them, I forget who, says, ""Old people are cool.""  I hope to god when I'm Leonard Cohen's age that I'm even a twentieth as cool as he is.  Both in this performance and in hearing him interviewed on Fresh Air with Terry Gross I was struck by how at peace he seems.  He seems to be a man with few regrets and if bitter about having to come out of retirement, he certainly doesn't show it.  As someone who is aging more than I'd like, I can really appreciate some of his best songs about growing older.  ""I ache in the places where I used to play.""  Trust me, I get that line.

The sound was good on this DVD, but I somewhat regret that the picture was 4:3 resolution instead of widescreen.  But those are minor complaints.  This is a wonderful record of one of the greatest songwriters of the past half century.  Cohen hasn't been as prolific as Bob Dylan, and he hasn't written as many great songs as Bob (thoug, who has?), but his very best songs can withstand comparison with the very best songs of anyone.  And if the tour he is currently wrapping up truly is his final one, at least we have this DVD and the CD soundtrack to remember him by.  But who knows.  Perhaps he will decide he had so much fun that he'll go back on the road to celebrate turning eighty.  If not, we love you Leonard!",1254614400,5,2424,4.2725274725274724
3780466,5,B001RTP3Z0,"So says the master minstrel and bard, humble and clearly enjoying himself at age 73 as he stands before a crowd of thousands at the O2 arena in London.

What follows demonstrates that these are not idle words - the ensuing three hours of exquisite music, poetry and song achieves a level of excellence that evidences a deep and abiding respect for the audience.

Unfortunately the same can't be said for the production of the concert DVD.

Unimaginative cinematography, the inexplicable selection of a 4:3 aspect ratio, and average sound quality detract from a musical event of uncommon excellence.

Cohen's work needs no introduction. His range as represented in the songs of this concert is remarkable. Alternately his is the voice of the prophet, the muse, the lecher, the lover, the poet, the madman and the priest. For this show he chose an eclectic retrospective including master performances of some less well-known works such as Who by Fire, The Gypsy's Wife, and If It Be Your Will. These stand alongside the greats such as Suzanne, Halleluiah, So Long Marianne, The Future, and I'm Your Man.

To help deliver this rarified material, Cohen has assembled an amazing band. The level of musicianship is beyond any I have ever experienced in a concert of popular music. Not exactly what one would tend to anticipate from a Leonard Cohen show.

How the show comes to a conclusion provides a glimpse as to what I am talking about.

After apparently getting ready to leave with a raunchy rendition of ""Closing Time"" the band breaks into ""I Tried to Leave You"". This closes out the show on a memorable note with each band member doing a solo and being introduced for the umpteenth time by Cohen.

Bob Metzger starts it off, coaxing a medley of mellifluous notes from his maple wood Telecaster.

Dino Soldo follows, putting down the mouth harp (just how many instruments does this guy play?) and lighting into a dusky moan of deep desire on the sax.

Then comes Neil Larson commanding the Hammond B3 with an authority akin to that of E. Power Biggs at the pedals of a giant pipe organ in some monstrous gothic cathedral.

Next is Sharon Robinson singing with a voice so sultry as to appear to tremble with an uncontrolled and not to be satisfied longing.

The fingers of Javier Mas fly over the strings of the archilaud with an abandon reminiscent of Zorba the Greek losing himself in dance.

And then the sublime Webb sisters (as Cohen constantly refers to them) warble and pant together in an almost ravenous and hungry harmony.

They are followed by musical director (if he directed this music he is an absolute genius) Roscoe Beck as he hits all the highest registers on the five string bass eliciting a series of sounds like nothing you've ever heard produced by this instrument before.

To top it all off, Rafael Bernardo Gayol unleashes a drum solo of tightly coiled and precisely controlled fury.

And Cohen sings ""Good night my darling, I hope you're satisfied. The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are opened wide. Yes and here's a man he's still working for your smile"".

The crowd goes berserk.

It's an incredible show - one that merits five stars plus, in spite of the technical shortcomings of the DVD production.",1254614400,2,3230,4.7375

Smile back as Cohen thanks you for the effort you took to be here.  Cohen's lyrics and music transcend what is petty, what is unanswerable, that which does not speak to love.  And you can hum all this well past closing time.  That said, whoever did the video should never be allowed to edit another film.  It is awful; out of focus, garish purple and blues, repetitive angles, great closeups of nostrils, and only an occasional shot of the magic that Cohen pulls with his hat.  Buy this DVD anyway, it's a 5 star because of the words, music,and the grace of a truly great musician.  Listen to it. Live it. Allow yourself to get hooked.  Hallelujah!",1253664000,,821,4.42

How could I have missed him all this time??  Well now I am an instant fan and this DVD is so good I really am at a loss for words to describe it.  I knew a lot of the songs that had been done by other artists but had still missed the genius himself.

The music itself is so good that it stands up to different versions by different artists but I always come back to his versions as my favorites.  For example BIRD ON A WIRE was done by Johnny Cash and it seemed vintage Johnny Cash...........but Leonard gives it a whole new feeling when you see his from the heart version.  GET IT!!!!  I also want to order K.D. Lange's version of Hallelujah which I saw Leonard say moved him deeply.

The audio engineer apparently didn't account for the amplification needed for a folk singer in a huge hall. The echo is persistent, annoying, and makes the lyrics (the main point of the performance) largely unintelligible.
I wouldn't give this DVD to anyone; I'm going to trash it.",1253577600,2,449,4.69620253164557
3780492,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Despite reports to the contrary, the DVD is wonderful.
First, as to the technical quibbles - it's all about the music and the performance - be glad it was captured! The picture and sound on my copy is GREAT. Watched on my 40"" LG plasma and on my 23"" PC monitor. The video in 4:3 480P is excellent for capturing a live performance in a low-key theater lighting situation.  The audio is clean, sharp and full range. The DVD experience is much more than the ""just music"" CD version some technophile has recommended. I find nothing negative about the technical quality. Enjoy the show.

Musically and performance-wize, this is one of the all-time great shows to see. Cohen's troupe of amazingly multi-talented and versatile musicians is a joy to witness.

Leonard is in his 75th year and is the master of his game. He touches all your emotions in a deep and complex way. This is a good DVD to watch with your sweetie along with some wine in a private location. Loaf of bread optional.

For vocals Leonard is supported by long-time collaborator and songwriter Sharon Robinson, and the wonderfully pure harmonies of the Webb sisters Charley and Hattie. Band members  Roscoe Beck (the musical director and Bassist) and Dino Soldo (winds & keyboard) also add to the harmonies. In the final hymn, everyone sings.

The musicians seem eclectic at first glance yet blend wonderfully. Cohen's music might suggest the very late night smoky atmosphere of a jazz club. The wide variety of musical traditions represented by the troupe, rather than conflicting with that atmosphere, bring it to a high level. The are all clearly deeply talented. One can sense that individually they could dazzle you with expertise in widely varying traditions but in this ensemble they have chosen to blend beautifully and masterfully in an understated way. At every point they are unforced, comfortable, deep, and delicious. If you are a musician of any of any caliber you will be in appreciative awe.

I'd go on and on praising each member, but better than that, just buy the damn DVD, grab your personal thou, and settle in for a great treat. Later, send Leonard a thank-you note.",1253318400,6,2149,4.8075880758807585

Then there is Roscoe Beck on bass, Rafael Bernardo Gayol on drums, Neil Larson on keyboards, Bob Metzger on lead guitar, the beautiful voices of Sharon Robertson, Charley Webb and Hattie Webb. Leonard also picks a great guitar. His music is timeless and much of it fits in with todays events. If I had to select a favorite song on this DVD it would be hard. I would have to narrow it to two. ""Dance With Me To The End of Love"" and ""Who By Fire"". Oh, did I mention that he mentions his band members a few times? :-).... What a pleasure to watch.",1252713600,,802,4.147435897435898

In spite of my pretensions, I had to admit that I'd never heard of Leonard Cohen and that only a lucky bit of channel-surfing brought him to my attention.
  I caught a couple of songs from this DVD on PBS and I was stunned. Leonard looked to be in his seventies (he was) and a master performer- one who gave the audience far more than they paid for and left them thankful they'd been so privileged.
  This wonderful DVD showcases Leonard's hits from over 40 years and you can sense that even as he aged, his sheer musical ability allowed him to adapt and present his material with incredible depth and power.

Leonard and the band were on top form, the best I've ever seen him perform. His voice has retained his richness, and the sardonic inflection and emotion are as profound and as present as ever. He performs various popular songs that span his entire career, and the run-time is quite long (over two hours). To give such a performance, and at his age - the passion, the philosophy and, most of all, the humility that he emits is staggering. Like I say, he is on top form, and to see him live was a magic spectacle I shall never forget, but, sadly, the DVD of this tour, as Live from London, fails miserably at capturing that magic. The filming and editing techniques used are totally unimaginative and, frankly, very boring. It's a travesty. Furthermore, the DVD contains minimal extras, not even subtitles, let alone interviews and behind the stage footage that I was hoping for. The DVD was done quickly with no extra effort put in for the Leonard Cohen fan to enjoy. I found the half-ass production quality of the DVD quite disappointing... but am I saying that the whole product is bad? No! My God, no. Whether you're a longtime fan, or a newbie just discovering Leonard's music, or just a person with an appreciation of great music, you will benefit greatly from seeing this recording of a true poet giving his all, his best, in delivering his musical message to his ever-growing multitude of fans. So, my consensus of the DVD is the same as that of most of the other reviewers, ""that while the technical aspects are disappointing; Leonard, the band and the backup singers are superb.""

His delight at singing for this crowd and his humility come through clearly.  It isn't often that you have a chance to see a great human being this close while hearing the poetry from his heart. His songs allow you to intimately relate to him and to our own deeper nature, to our own true nature.  If you enjoy Leonard's music this DVD adds an extra dimension, don't pass it up.

The same happens with the harmonica on Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye. What's more, the audience resonates with LC's every word between songs, whether it be witty or just wonderful. He wisely chooses wit when introducing the disturbing or apocalyptic ones like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future/dp/B0012GMVDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future</a>&nbsp;and Everybody Knows. The first part of the concert concludes with Anthem, a sublime collision of sound & vision with a lengthy outro in which Leonard acknowledges the individual musicians. He does that often throughout the performance.

The proceedings resume with a good laugh or two whereupon Leonard humbly thanks the audience for keeping his songs alive down the years. Ecstatic applause erupts as he sings the ironic line ""born with the gift of a golden voice"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tower-of-Song/dp/B000001EZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tower of Song</a>.

The upbeat mood lasts through a rousing rendition of So Long Marianne; it is abruptly displaced by the subdued resignation of Sisters of Mercy which is however, simultaneously tender and reassuring.

For the third time, Leonard recites - the first few lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-It-Be-Your-Will/dp/B0012GMW7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If It Be Your Will</a>. Then he hands the prayer to the Webb Sisters who accompany themselves on harp and guitar for a supra-numinous performance. From the divine to the irreverent, the pace picks up for the buoyant Closing Time as the singers sway and the music swirls to the catchy tune. At the end, all the musicians join voices on the comforting conclusion Whither Thou Goest. July 17, 2008 was clearly a night to remember for those present.

I have seen three concerts during his version of the Neverending Tour -- Toronto back a June ago when it was just getting underway, April in Seattle, May at Radio City Music Hall in NYC.  I intend to see as many more as I can before it ends, and I hope it never does.

Meanwhile, Live in London relives them every time I put it in the DVD.  The camera work here is pretty basic, but the closeups show just how much fun Cohen and his merry band are having as they perform.  It is all choreographed and that's fine.  I think the song list here in London varied by one from NYC and two from Seattle.  Most of us don't go for spontaneity, but for Leonard's history and his poem stories and for his multiangled take on life.  Some of it can be very somber, but as he commented in Seattle, even in the bad times ""cheerfulness"" keeps breaking through.  He's 74, he's produced a tremendous body of work, he's surrounded himself with wonderful individual collaborators, musicians, and backup singers, he wears a battered fedora, he gives you nearly three hours of performance, and he skips off stage at the end.

I loved it so much that I bought the cd and the dvd. I have listened to it non stop for 2 weeks stoping only to go to work and clean my house. If you have never heard Cohen then you should. A friend at work heard my cd and she loved it and she said how is it that I haave never heard of him before I am 54 just like you. Well My only regret is that he has not chosen to tour the usa. Maybe he will one day. My husband has seen him in concert years ago and I am so jealous. Hey you can't take your money with you, and even in the troubling times facing us his music brings such joy and peace.",1243123200,,910,3.7447916666666665

3780543,5,B001RTP3Z0,"If you're a fan of Leonard Cohen, or need an introduction to his work, I recommend this DVD. This London show is basically the same show that he is performing on his current tour of the US, if a bit stripped down.

If you are not able to catch a show on the current tour, then this is the next best thing. Leonard, in his 74th year, is amazing and the musicians that back him are brilliant. The 3 backup singers, Sharon Robinson and the Webb sisters, are wonderful.

As mentioned in previous reviews, the songs represent a specrum of Leonard's 4 decade career. His voice has deepend and become more husky over the years, but is still very literate, emotional and beautiful. You might want to get some of his early CDs to contrast the change in voice...both are appealing in different ways.

Easy 5 star rating for this DVD.",1242604800,,823,4.437086092715232
3780564,5,B001RTP3Z0,"This disk does a great job of demonstrating the wide range of Leonard Cohen's catalogue of outstanding songs, beginning with mid-late 1960's.  His voice has darkened over the years, but that only makes songs like Susanne, or the Sisters of Mercy, all the more powerful.  He was clearly enjoying himself during the show, and is truly appreciative of the overwhelmingly warm response by the audience.  He makes an aside about understanding some patrons were being inconvenienced financially and geographically to attend the show (I was willing to spend big bucks and travel thousands of miles to go to the show - couldn't make it happen) and then says ""we"" (not I) are honored to play for you tonight.

3780604,4,B001RTP3Z0,"After a 15 year absence from the stage, Leonard Cohen returned in 2008 to the stage in a wildely succesfull European tour. This DVD catches Cohen at London's O2 Arena in July, and what a great show it is.

The ""Leonard Cohen: Live In London"" DVD (157 min.) brings the show in all of its glory, and let me state upfront that this DVD is a pleasure to watch from a video-editing perspective. The camera focuses primarily on Leonard, although the rest of his backing band gets plenty of limelight too (in particular long-time back-up vocalist Jennifer Warnes) and thankfully, doesn't change every 2 or 3 seconds to a different perspective, as the MTV-generation has gotten used to. The highlights are many, many, many, but just to point out a few: the opener ""Dance Me To The End of Love"", ""The Future"", ""I'm Your Man"", ""First We Take Manhattan"", and the short a-capella closer ""Whither Thou Ghost"", but thruth be told, if you are a fan, there are no weak tracks on here.

I had the great fortune of catching Leonard Cohen's set at Coachella a few weeks ago, and what a memorable event that was. He performed at 7:30 pm, just as the sun was setting, and with the hreat background of palm trees and all that is Coachella, it made for one truly memorable set. This DVD is a great momento for anyone who has had the great fortune of catching Leonard live in what is possibly his last tour. Not to be missed!",1241222400,6,1401,4.46875

3780606,5,B001RTP3Z0,"If you are his fan you will not be able to resist watching this video again and again. Cohen's meaningful poetry and melodies are emphasized by excellent musicians who perform using exotic instruments. A special highlight is the version by the twin backup singers of ""If It Be Your Will"", which the poet prefaces with a few spoken lines of that prayer-like composition. The artist begins with ""Dance Me to the End of Love"" and ends with several familiar encores. This admirer thought the show would last an hour and a half or so but was an hour longer and it is heard that in a concert in San Francisco the series of encores lasted longer than the actual show.

I'd still recommend you still see him life if you can, but if you can't (or after you have), a great, great DVD to own & have.",1240704000,,339,3.6164383561643834
3780609,5,B001RTP3Z0,"The world is split into three groups of people: those who have adored Leonard Cohen for the past 40 years; those who discovered him recently (say in the last ten years), and those who have yet to find out about him.  I'm in the second group of people.

This is unquestionably a 5* DVD, but this is no fawning review.  From end to end this concert is a blast.  The songs are fantastic; the singer is fantastic, and the supporting band is fantastic.  What makes it so?  Well, aside from the quality of the songs (and that alone is worth the price of admission), the whole thing comes across as hugely entertaining, and can I say, fun.  I've never seen the man (I wish I had), but I keep thinking of Frank Sinatra when I see Leonard in his fedora hat.  Let's put Leonard Cohen up there with Frank - one of the greats!

I saw this gig live in Australia a couple of months back, and the DVD is a faithful reproduction of what I saw, then and how I remember it now.  And therein lies a problem I have with the whole thing.  In going to the gig I read various reviews and such like, each of which was glowing in its praise, and each of which regaled us with a quip that Leonard came up with during the respective concerts under review.  Live in concert, as on this DVD, Leonard came up with the same quips at the same time.  This leaves me with a mild feeling of being short changed - the spontaniety one associates with live concerts is missing.  It's no big deal, and it shouldn't impair your enjoyment of what is otherwise a wonderful event, but I offer this view in sincerity.  In equal sincerity, I believe that it is still a 5* gig.  If you have $20 left on your credit card you have to type in those numbers now.

For those of you in the latter group of the three types of people (those still to discover Leonard Cohen), this DVD is a good starting point.  If not this, then the double CD, The Essential Leonard Cohen, is well worth considering.  It offers a few songs not on the DVD (A Thousand Kisses Deep, for example) and is a great place to start.  What the heck - do yourself a favour and put $40 on the plastic - buy them both.",1240531200,2,2134,4.1711491442542785
3780610,5,B001RTP3Z0,"Fantastic video of LC's concert tour!  Every emotion, every nuance visible on his face.  Should be of particular interest to those who attended a concert and were not able to get close seats or have the big screens.  Also a great introduction to the man and his music.",1240444800,,268,4.541666666666667
3780611,4,B001RTP3Z0,"This is pretty much a bare bones DVD featuring extended London concert footage. I have no beef with the camera work. It is simple, but effective, and much preferable to so many concert videos where the camera moves so much and cuts from one angle to the next occur so quickly it threatens to  give one vertigo, or at least a headache.

The choice of 4:3 aspect ratio, in an era where even run-of-the-mill TV shows are widescreen, is inexplicable. The video quality is good, but not great. [A customer has reported that some sets offer a 16:9 version. That is good news, but be sure what you're getting before you buy. Mine is only 4:3. With a widescreen disc, I would bump up the rating to 4 1/2 stars.]

The audio could have been better. Happily, an uncompressed LCPM stereo track is available (the default) on the DVD, which should make for maximum sound quality. But the disc producers chose to muck this up, too. The sound is dynamically compressed, i.e. the soft parts are made loud so the dynamic contrast between soft and loud is blunted. When the band gets going full blast, the sound is congested -- it loses some clarity. Nevertheless, I would rate the sound as good, not great -- equivalent in sound quality to a musical segment on the Letterman show or Tonight Show on digital TV.

The concert is great, and Leonard is full of warmth and grit, whatever is called for. Leonard Cohen appears to be having the time of his life, and the band is perfect. His angelic choir, a trio of female backup singers, is magnificent. The guitarist provides Knopfler-esque lead lines, and his ""wind instrument"" and keyboard players add richness to the mix.

This is the perfect introduction to Leonard Cohen. It represents his best compositions (though I am disappointed that Joan of Arc is not part of the set list). At age 74 Cohen's voice is a bit husky, but these performances are as good as any I've ever heard on his studio albums or live material. (Granted, I do not have a large collection of Cohen albums, however I appreciate very much his songs, including those performed by other artists.) It's hard to imagine him ever topping this.

If you are unfamiliar with Leonard Cohen's music, it is generally quite simple, with common chord progressions and easy melodies. You might quickly find yourself singing along with these tunes. Cohen's strengths are his poetry and his delivery of the poetic line. He has always loved embellishing the simplicity of the songs with female choruses and fuller arrangements, while the structure retains the essence of folk music. Sometimes he favors a Spanish rhythm.

For me, this is the definitive Leonard Cohen live performance, much as Joni Mitchell's Shadows and Light concert DVD highlights her best songs and best performances a with dream team band. That DVD is also deficient technically, but the music shines through. So it is here. It's a five star concert with one star deducted for technical quality that does not measure up to the artistry of the performance.",1239926400,93,3011,4.745697896749522
3780612,4,B001RTP3Z0,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer who said this is technically disappointing.  That is absolutely correct.  The concert's set list is amazing and the musicians are first class.  However, the video appears to have been done by a bootlegger!  The camera work is not good and the technical aspects of the video leave much to be desired.  For example, the colors are off and the camera work is not up to par.  Other than the questionable technical aspects, the concert itself is fine and Cohen shows why he is still the man!",1239408000,3,527,4.612903225806452
3780613,5,B001RTP3Z0,"My wife and I had the privilege of seeing Leonard in concert here in Phoenix on April 5.  The performance was quite possibly the best I've seen in more than 40 years of attending concerts, and it was nearly identical to the London concert captured on this DVD.  As a result, we now have a wonderful reminder of the superb show we saw.  But for those unable to attend the live show, this DVD is the next best thing to being there.  Still, if you can be there, don't pass up the opportunity to see this extraordinary man, his musicians and his backup singers - it is well worth the cost.

Others have commented on the quality of the other performers, and I can't really add much here, other than to echo those sentiments - they are all world class.  A few of them probably deserve special mention, though.  Sharon Robinson's vocals on a couple of songs she co-wrote - ""In My Secret Life"" and ""Boogie Street"" - are among the concert highlights.  And the Webb Sisters' version of ""If It Be Your Will"" is nothing short of breathtaking.  Javier Mas does some sensational work on various forms of the acoustic guitar.

Most likely, everyone reading this is already a Leonard Cohen fan (disciple?), so remarks about his brilliance and the impact his work has on people probably all go without saying.  Instead, I will just say that all of that shines through in this DVD, and every Leonard Cohen fan should have a copy.

Some reviews here mention disappointment with the sound, but our experience has been entirely positive.  We did find that some adjustments to our system settings were necessary in order to get the most of out of it, but once we did that, it was just like being back at the Dodge Theater on April 5.",1239321600,32,1711,4.480645161290322
