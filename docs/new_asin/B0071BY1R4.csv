8508190,4,B0071BY1R4,"A group of space pirates rob a space casino/brothel and escape with their astro-drive and camp acting. They hide out on a small moon, inhabited by CG parasites and a man in a bad monster costume. Here the captain gets turned into a vampire and turns others into vampires with about half the women getting their tops ripped off before getting bit in the neck.

This is a camp film which almost borrows lines from other science fiction films, generally stopping at one word. The acting and effects were bad. Stephanie Hyden plays a pleasure clone with many fantasy costume changes.

4 stars for the nudity.

8508194,4,B0071BY1R4,"Planet of the Vampire Women is the most fun I've had watching a vampire movie since Blood On The Highway. I'm not going to say it's a great movie, because it's not. But it is a guilty pleasure kind of movie. The movie runs 95 minutes, and the first hour or so are pretty average. Well, other than the boobs. But the third act kicks butt, with a load of gore and plenty of sexy vampire women baring their fangs. Worth seeing if you're a b-movie fan.",1340496000,,448,4.160919540229885
8508195,1,B0071BY1R4,"If you are a horror movie fan who enjoys a good movie, pass this one by.  It is about half a star above ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" and that's being generous.",1339718400,,162,4.0625
8508196,5,B0071BY1R4,"This movie is for lovers of cult sci-fi and horror films. It is a literal love letter to all the campy attempts at sci-fi in the pre-Star Wars era. Limited budget, cheesy special effects, but that's just the way real cult movie fans like it! Think Army Of Darkness, Ice Pirates, Mad Max, films like that, if you loved those you will love this one.  Never heard about any of the films I've mentioned? If you're not a jaded Michael Bay-blinded moviegoer with unreasonably impossible expectations then you will love any and possibly all the films I've mentioned above. If you think this won't lead to bigger and better films then you obviously haven't checked out Peter Jackson's early work. He was once making crazy fun movies just like this, and now he's world famous for one of the hugest epic movie trilogies ever! Honestly, I never saw that coming, but I'm glad it happened.

I happen to live in the same town as the people who made this movie and I have been seeing their films and going to their summer cult film festivals for years, it's always a good time. I went to see this movie in the theatre, expecting to have a good time and that was all. I was totally blown away by the sets and effects managed on the meager budget that they had for this film. I regard it as a new instant classic like Wild Zero or Repo The Genetic Opera. I left the theatre thinking ""Man, I don't know how they are going to top that."" Well just recently I found out that they are making another film called Badass Monster Killer. Just from the title alone it already sounds awesome. Check out the details here:[...]. Planet of the Vampire Women is a kick-ass inspiration to local independent filmmakers everywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if this film inspires as many young aspiring film makers in the way that the Ramones spawned countless punk bands around the world as they toured over the years. Support local film making!",1335916800,3,1910,4.533333333333333
