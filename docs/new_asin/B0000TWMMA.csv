1945892,5,B0000TWMMA,"While the rest choose Back to Basics, I'd say Stripped for me!!!! It will always remain her very special era.  I feel like she was becoming her own person and breaking out as an artist. I know I'm in the minority, but I love how she had the whole gothic glam/street/rock rebel/urban look going on with the beanie hats, the cowgirl chaps, the black hair streaks, piercings, etc. Many people didn't like the super thin eyebrows, but I actually did. Probably because I grew up having these ugly thick bushy eyebrows and wanted nothing more than to wax them all off! As for the Stripped tour, I love all the costumes and the performances. I love the interaction she had with the crowd. I'd say it's better than the My Reflections concert. I love how she was very outspoken and knew what she stood for this time around. She was just so bad ass and I love it!!! She continues to my inspiration to this very day!",1413676800,,905,4.419161676646707

1945896,5,B0000TWMMA,This was a gift for a friend and she was very happy - agreed that it was a great concert DVD and recommended to others.,1400630400,,119,3.8
1945897,2,B0000TWMMA,"acts like a juvenile 40 year old ...not a lot of heart or authenticy in her style or presentation, seems to get into the hooker image,
better to get real and concentrate on her better qualities as a singer and otherwise...Hey but she a big success, so maybe that what sells the most these days.",1395878400,,294,4.363636363636363
1945898,5,B0000TWMMA,I loved this DVD. She was perfect all through. I highly recommend this to all CA fans. This woman can sing.,1392422400,,107,4.142857142857143
1945899,5,B0000TWMMA,"I so badly wanted to attend this concert when she came to Buffalo with Justin Timberlake but I was out of town and never had the chance. This DVD is just Christina but that's fine with me. It's entertaining, good song choices. I was a little surprised by a couple of the songs she chose to do but it didn't take anything away from the quality of the concert. Good Buy!",1370476800,,368,4.197183098591549
1945900,5,B0000TWMMA,"Christina is 22 years old in this concert DVD. She amazed me then, she amazes me now. Her voice sounds like she was sent from the angels above. But then again, her sound might not be for everybody, but it is for me. I love those triple high notes, with the feeling of soul.  I believe this DVD was her first tour concert (don't quote me on that).  The body language, the dancers, the back-up vocalists..... there is a TON of talent on all of Christina's stages. You just can't go wrong. I'm 57, her voice has moved me to tears at points, music has been a very big part of my life and I absolutely admire her wonderful talent. This is a great DVD!",1370217600,,646,4.16
1945911,4,B0000TWMMA,"Christina performs better than she talks about performing.  Her performances
and band give your money's worth, but her chat & giggle between songs is distracting.  Her current presence on the TV show THE VOICE is more interesting than her comments about music in this DVD.",1330905600,,272,5.022222222222222
1945912,4,B0000TWMMA,These were the days when Christina knew how to show off her talent. She still has it but has lost her understanding of how to put it to good use. She has an amazing voice and sings really well on this DVD - I thought she put on a good show.,1324598400,,240,3.7254901960784315
1945913,4,B0000TWMMA,"Honestly, Christina has fallen way off the map today compared to the peak she was at in this DVD. It's almost sad to watch now realizing where she has gone after the heat she brought here. This concert is super entertaining and a must have for concert DVD lovers like myself. She entertains from beginning to end.",1323388800,,313,4.508771929824562
1945914,4,B0000TWMMA,"I've never seen Christina Aguilera perform live in concert, but viewing the Stripped dvd has got me amped up to check her out on her next tour. It's obvious that the bubbly teenager from the Genie era had matured into a sexually charged, ""take no prisoners"" diva that was a put-on at times, but entertaining onstage.

The opener Dirrty isn't as strong as the album version, but still fiery, aggressive, and not as raunchy as you'd think. Same with the Get Mine, Get Yours performance (the Spanish version would've made a nice bonus). Genie in a Bottle gets a fresh, though much too short, Arabic makeover and the popfest Come on Over (All I Want Is You) is transformed into an R&B laced acoustic set that would've made an excellent album track. It's a shame that only a snippet of Loving Me 4 Me is featured, but the video segment is gorgeous.

Xtina shows some guts by taking on the Etta James classic At Last and she KILLS IT! The outfit she wears during the Fighter performance looks alot like Janet's from the That's the Way Love Goes and If videos. I don't know if she knew that at the time, but it looks awesome. The jazzy Impossible spotlights that incredible voice of hers as does the darkly sensual Walk Away, The Voice Within and Beautiful (love the ""God Sees No Color"" t-shirt).

A past reviewer claimed that Christina shows no emotion during the Beautiful performance, but I respectfully disagree. Why does she have to cry to prove she's feeling the song? I found her smile and big wave to the audience as an encouragement for them to bask in their own beauty and celebrate it. You may have been through alot, but take the time to smile and be thankful that you're still here. My opinion anyway.

The extras could've been better. Short interviews with Christina sharing her thoughts about the Stripped record, her videos, and the tour. The Q&A bit with the fans was pretty meh, but the section introducing the dancers, stylists, and choreographers is pretty cool. Despite the lackluster bonus material, the concert itself is amazing. Check it out!",1284249600,2,2059,4.663911845730028
1945915,3,B0000TWMMA,"This concert is good!
But ,
Honestly,
Has no replay value
Sorry Xtina
I love ya, but sorry!",1277683200,,91,4.111111111111111
1945916,5,B0000TWMMA,"I wish I was at that concert, I really do. That was an amazing concert. This is my favorite albums of hers. It was wonderful from start to finish. The shirt she wears at the end fits perfect for the song she sang. (The shirt said , ""God sees no color"" and she sang Beautiful). The way her voice brings you in, she always gives me goosebumps. You won't regret buying this DVD.",1273708800,,375,4.1506849315068495
1945917,5,B0000TWMMA,"I'm a huge Christina fan, I admire her spirit and her attitude. You may not agree with her, but you watch this and see that she really is a fantastic performer. I watch this dvd so much for the performance as much as the fantastic music.",1258156800,,237,4.173913043478261

THIS IS A GREAT SHOW. I REALLY LIKED IT",1228089600,,123,3.5925925925925926
1945919,5,B0000TWMMA,"If you are a fan of this talanted singer, this is a must have dvd. Everyone knows that this gal can out sing her contemperaries, but what they may not know is that she is an amazing stage performer with great charisma and energy. Christina connects with her audience and displays a true love and commitment to her fans. This ""Live in the UK"" show is both emotionally moving and sexy. The many dancers add a wonderful element to the performance ,and Christina interacts with them tremendously. Don`t wait. Order this NOW.",1173398400,,520,4.663043478260869

1945931,5,B0000TWMMA,great singing. good show. good bit of extra features. worth more than it costs to anyone who knows anything about anything.,1168473600,,123,4.904761904761905
1945932,5,B0000TWMMA,"When I think about Christina Aguilera I think the ""Special One"" the most underated artist out now. People get so lost and focused on her image that they forget about her VOICE and writing capability. I have to compare these two. When Mariah Carey first came out she was flawless. Excellent writing ability and Flawless voice. Now when she sings live her voice dryes out on the second verse and she looks like she struggling all the time and people hail her as the best female vocalist out.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! sorry you used to be now you have been dethroned and Christina took the crown. If you put Christina and Mariah singing live Christina would blow her right off the mic. If you watch this dvd Christina is the only artist who sounds better live than her studio recordings...who does that??? Her voice is powerful, strong, clear and flawless. This dvd should have came with a stamp because she stamped herself the best female vocalist out right now with her performances.

When she first came out she told an interviewer that she wanted to be one of the greats and now she accomplished that. Well done ChristinA!!",1149120000,23,1117,4.6938775510204085
1945933,3,B0000TWMMA,"I desperately wanted to give this 4 or even 5 stars but I was ever so slightly disappointed by a few things. Christina is well known for her big voice. She has got to be way up there with Whitney and Maria and she really blares out these songs with great enthusiasm and power. However, when singing I couldn't help notice her total lack of emotion. There are some great artists out there who really deliver a great deal of emotion when they sing, such a Whitney Houston and Meat Loaf but, unfortunately Christina just isn't one of them. When she was singing `Beautiful' at the end of the show I really expected to see a tear in her eye but to my surprise, at one point she started to laugh and then gave a massive wave to the audience as if to say `look at me' with a gaping smile on her face. Emotion is one of the most important aspects of a live performance in my opinion because it allows the people who are watching and listening to actually feel the song and it takes it to a whole new level.

To my surprise Christina is also an artist that goes off stage every other performance to get ready for the next song. It's ok when you're watching it on DVD because there is no waiting but the people in the audience must have waited longer than she was actually on stage. This is more believable when you see some of the overblown costumes that she wears which must have taken hours to put on and prepare. This makes my respect for Christina go down ever so slightly because I like an artist that goes out onto stage and sings song after song without getting `ready' in between. Overall, however, I did enjoy the show and her voice just absolutely blew me away, so if it is her voice you're after then buy this.",1136592000,3,1712,4.251533742331288
1945934,5,B0000TWMMA,"I have never written a review of anything, however, I am

compelled to now. This DVD of Xtina is so unbelievable for words! If you like her voice, you will fall in LOVE with her as well! I am a 42 guitarist/ vocalist who would love to fill in for Mike Herring, Chris' guitar player.........just once! Anyway, Her performance on this DVD is insatiable! I love every song on this DVD, but Walk Away is so emotional you can feel the energy, in my opinion. The sound, production and scenery is top notch! I have watched this DVD about 6 times already and I am ready for number 7!

One tip when viewing this; Make sure the audio is cranked!

Thank you Chris for an unbelievable product!

1945935,5,B0000TWMMA,"With all the negative media towards Christina's sex image. I was expecting a very ""Dirrty"" tour. Instead I get a very personal look into her music's meaning, and what she is trying to promote. Here are my favorite performances:

DIRRTY- There was such intense dancing and stage presence. This is my favorite part of the show.
THE VOICE WITHIN- Christina tells us to follow our own instincts before she sings. I really needed to hear that.
GENIE IN A BOTTLE (Arabian Remix- How shocking to see the star of the show chained to a big metal X. The rock version of the song isn't my favorite. But I think the performance was to show that she is new woman, instead to a ""genie"" in a bottle.
MAKE OVER- I don't remember this song being on the DVD, but it may be on a foreign release.
COME ON OVER BABY (ALL I WANT IS YOU- I love the acoustic R&B version of this song.
IMPOSSIBLE- Very jazzy. She really showed a lot of emotion with this song. The setting made me feel very comfortable.
AT LAST- She sang this song best. Near the end she really belted out the song's lyrics.
FIGHTER- I like this because of its loud guitar sounds, but Christina refrains from vocal gymnastics.
WHAT A GIRL WANTS- Love this song. But she refrains from vocal gymnastics on this one as well. She's really just having fun with this song.
BEAUTIFUL- When Christina hinting at singing a very ""special"" song, the cameras switched to scenes of the audience.
It was a prolific ending to the Stripped Tour.
This really is a good DVD, and Christina puts her all into it.",1133222400,7,1534,4.439716312056738
1945936,4,B0000TWMMA,"Christina sounds so amazing live, most singers can't get up to the standards on their cd and the notes, but Christina can go above and beyond.

This is Christina's latest official dvd, this was her only concert in the UK so far, to enjoy in your own home.

It includes some of the latest hit singles from her multi platnium cd Stripped like ""Dirrty, "" ""The Voice Within,"" ""Can't Hold Us Down,"" ""Fighter,"" and of course one of her best songs ""Beuatiful.""

Christina also songs old songs with a new twist like her debut song ""Genie in a Bottle,"" her second single, ""What a Girl Wants,"" and an acoustic version of ""Come on Over.""

I think Christina best performance was singing ""At Last."" Absolutely amazing.

Included:

-Interview with Christina on her latest album Stripped

-Meet some people who work with Christina: dancers, stylists etc.

-See Christina's tour bus!

-And much more!

Buy it you won't regret it if you love Christina!",1128902400,5,935,4.751552795031056
1945937,5,B0000TWMMA,"I did not get a chance to go to her concert, so  i purchased the DvD.  I loved  it , it was proberbly one of the best concerts i have seen. she is a true artist.  she really sings her songs. and performed to them.  Each song has a themed performance that fit perfectly with the song. I loved it. It was worth every cent. can't wait to buy her next cd.",1124496000,,351,3.8194444444444446
1945938,3,B0000TWMMA,"I have mixed feelings about this concert. There were things I liked and things I hated. I'll start with the bad. Christina has a very powerful voice but she has trouble controlling it. Some of those notes were all over the place. During performances like 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Fighter', I thought my ear drums were going to explode from all the excessive shouting. X-tina, my dear, do not attempt to sing and dance simultaneously because you can't pull it off.

Now onto the good. I thought the costumes were awesome and the choreography was right on point. Part of the fun was eagerly waiting to see what skimpy outfit X-tina would come out in next. And her dancers deserve lots of praise for going out there and putting on a great show. They made the upbeat songs more enjoyable to watch.

Christina definitely shines through on her slow ballads though. When she's not pouncing around or attempting to dance--you can really hear what a captivating voice she has. During performances like 'At Last', 'The Voice Within', 'Impossible', and 'Walk Away', I got chills from hearing her hit those high notes. Another applaud worthy performance is 'Get Mine,Get Yours'. Very sexy--very sensual--very Christina.

Overall, an okay concert. The costumes and stage-setups make it more enjoyable to watch. 3.5 stars.",1121126400,3,1305,4.977064220183486
1945939,5,B0000TWMMA,"In person or on tape this concert, her voice and her wardrobe is fantastic. If you like C.A, you'll love this !",1120867200,4,111,4.090909090909091
1945940,5,B0000TWMMA,"there's no doubt that christina has the best vocals right now on the business, but with this show, oh my god, i tought that a show like this just would be possible by peoples who has decades of carear, but she's made it... the show it's perfect you never saw something like this, she proves that she still the best. every song is so well sang andso well transformed from the original.

this dvd has just a problem don't have the videos from christina, and that's not god cuz they are the coolest (i meen you have seen dirrty).

buy it you will not regret.",1118361600,2,555,4.276190476190476
1945950,5,B0000TWMMA,"Christina have really come up and out with her voice I have listened to her voice from day one and it's evident that her voice has gotten stronger and more powerful over the years.  Christina's concert was a great hit! I really enjoyed the way she set up her stage choreograph and just seeing her perform makes me wanna kick myself and say ""Why didn't you go for it too""? Oh well anyway this DVD is sure to make you dance, sing (if you can sing a tune) and clap your hands and say ""YOU GO GIRL""! you will not be disappointed!!!",1112659200,2,527,4.166666666666667
1945951,5,B0000TWMMA,"This has got to be my favourite dvd to date. Her vocals are amazing,dance moves,and all around an amazing performance.

1945952,5,B0000TWMMA,"After hearing the wonderful album ""Stripped"", we can finally see the concert !

It's simply great.

Christina can sing, there's no doubt about it.

Just look at her vocal performances in ""At Last"", ""Impossible"", ""Walk Away"" or at the end of ""What A Girl Wants"", she has a great voice.

And she doesn't lypsinc !

We find on this DVD all her singles (""Dirrty"", ""Beautiful"", ""The Voice Within"", ""Can't Hold Us Down"" and ""Fighter"").

She also remixed some of her older songs, like ""Genie In A Bottle"" and ""What A Girl Wants"".

She sings an acoustic version of ""Come On Over"", so better than the original version.

The show begins with ""Dirrty"" and then ""Get Mine, Get Yours"", some dancing songs, and it finishes with an acapella version of ""Beautiful"", so emotive.

Christina has so many faces, she can make you dance or make ou cry in just one hour and half.

The concert is almost perfect, but maybe there are not bonus enough on the DVD.

Some interviews and so on; perhaps a good documentary or a CD with unreleased songs like ""I Will Be"", ""That's What Love Can Do"" or ""Dame Lo Que Yo Te Doy"", the spanish version of ""Get Mine, Get Yours"" would have been more interesting.

But this DVD deserves its five stars, the concert is so exceptional.",1111968000,,1243,4.524663677130045
1945953,5,B0000TWMMA,"I know it's already been said...but...this girl can SANG!!! Christina's vocal abilities never fail to amaze me. Even when she's hopping around while dancing, she still sounds good. Now, she's actually singing. She is not lip-syncing like another certain Mousketeer does on her concerts. This is highly entertaining. The was she sang the Etta James classic ""At Last"" was beautiful. She sang it almost as well as Etta herself. If Etta heard it, she would give Christina a well-earned pat on the back. This DVD is amazing and I would recommend in your collection of concert DVDs. It outshines any of Britney's attempts at a concert and is more about the music than the flashiness of dancers and special effects. I urge you to buy it.",1109894400,,730,4.801587301587301
1945954,4,B0000TWMMA,"This girl continues to blow me away. At first, I must admit I was greatly hesistant on buying this DVD. However, now I am seriously happy I did. I have watched Beyonce's DVD concert from Wembley and after seeing Christina I now feel cheated. Christina's performances matched her costumes and her stage presence was amazing and the pyro. She interracted so well with the audience. Her performances were even better than the videos and albums. I'd definitely rate her among the best in concert performances that have the right to be released for sale. Note to Beyonce: Go back to the drawing board and take note of what Christina and her troop has done. Stop giving us repeat performances. Thanks Christina for a wonderful buy!!!",1109548800,3,727,4.824

Talk about beautiful vocals she is one of the most beautiful singers on the earth. along with dancing and singing and hott body. it is one of the best live dvd's i have ever watched. I love this singer so much she is just great. ive watched it exactly 177 times to date. I wish there was a cd of all of these they are so clear and high quality.,1109376000,3,402,3.962962962962963
1945956,5,B0000TWMMA,"Hello everyone. Just wanted to say when I bought this DVD I thought it was awesome. She has a really amazing voice, and she can also dance her butt off. In my personal favorite ""Walk Away"" as she slithers on the floor you can feel the pain in her voice. The dancer that comes out with her in that song is also one of Britney's dancers. But anyways I found this DVD to be amazing and I have seen it 4 times in the past week, so you will NOT be disappointed. The only downfall is the special features, I think they should have added more, but other than that her performance in the DVD is flawless...",1109116800,3,598,4.119658119658119
1945957,5,B0000TWMMA,"This dvd is a masterpiece. Im not talking bout the camera angles n stuff (although that's good too) I mean the performance.

Christina has such an amazingly powerful voice, and anyone who doubts that should watch this dvd and they will realise it.

there is no-one else like her in the bussiness and i think with shows like this she will be around for a long time.

*The most impressive vocally is 'At Last' an Etta James cover

*the most moving is 'Beautiful'

*the best to dance to is 'what a girl wants'

*the best girlpower is 'can't hold us down'

*the best anthem is 'fighter'

I however as well as loving all of those loved the smooth vocals on 'get mine, get yours' and the change in 'come on over' 'cruz' is good live(as is the whole dvd) and 'voice within' is just meaningful 4 me.

The dvd is amazing as are the songs on it, so there is no reason for u not to buy it.

Could hav some of her pop videos on it but i won't take marks away for that. 5 stars",1108598400,4,964,4.106951871657754
1945958,5,B0000TWMMA,"This DVD is definitely better than her last concert in DVD, ""My Reflection"", because this concert is more intense, and exciting. She sang the perfect tracks and in a great order. The tracklisting is:

1. Stripped Intro Part 1

2. Dirrty

3. Get Mine, Get Yours

4. The Voice Within

5. Genie In A Bottle

6. Can't Hold Us Down

7. Contigo En La Distancia/Falsas Esperanzas

The special features the DVD includes are good, but not very good. Before I bought the DVD, I thought the ""RSPV"" section, where the fans ask questions to Christina, would have been better, because they ask some stupid things, like ""Were you nervous before the concert?""...Bla, bla, bla, it's like the 100th time someone asks that to Christina...

But the most important part in the DVD is the concert, and it's great, so that's why I gave it 5 stars.",1107648000,7,1041,4.518918918918919
1945969,4,B0000TWMMA,"The concert portion of this DVD is great.  The setlist is perfect; the re-arranged songs from her nearly unlistenable debut album sound wonderful.  The beautiful ""Cruz"" is probably the best song on here.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes the camera cuts too fast, even during the more uptempo songs.

The best part of this DVD is the showcasing of Christina's voice.  She is obviously singing and does not need to rely on a flashy stage setup (even though it is rather elaborate) or hoards of backup dancers (even though there are backup dancers) to put on a good show.  I missed her tour when it came through my area, and this DVD is a pretty good substitute, I think.

The bonus features, however, don't cut it.  The interview and fan Q&A are incredibly short and have absolutely no depth- Christina pretty much says the same thing during the between-song chatter.  I'll admit, though, that the introduction of her tour musicians/crew is rather interesting.

In short, this is essential for any fan of Christina's.  The concert is fantastic in terms of sound and visuals, and even though the extras are lousy, the price of this DVD is low enough not to matter.",1105747200,2,1173,4.700980392156863
1945970,4,B0000TWMMA,"It took 4ever and a day for this DVD 2 come out due to its continuously post-poned release dates.  However, I must say the ""Stripped"" DVD was worth the wait.  A few summers ago, I had tix to go see Xtina on tour in DC, but due 2 the lighting incident, the show got re-scheduled & I couldn't make the new date.  So, I was thankful 4 this DVD.

 It lived up to my expectations 4 the most part.  Her voice is fantastic as usual.  The show has theatrical elements & whatnot, etc. but it's not overdone...leaving the show to focus on what Xtina does best & that's singing. She's a true entertainer...one who doesn't need all the elaborate sets & pyro to keep U interested for 2 hours. Standpout performances would have to be her mellowed out, jazzy R&B version of ""Come On Over"", ""At Last"", & ""Impossible"".  Her voice is at its best during ""Impossible"".  Anyone who can hold my attention by just sitting on top of piano & singing for 4 mins is truly talented.

  I only had one disappointment with the show. Although Xtina's voice sounds terrific.  She doesn't quite belt out many of the songs like she does on the cd.  This is understandable being that she's touring night after night, but I guess since I've been w/out cable 4 a while & hadn't seen her perform much....I wanted to see her wail out every song, particularly ""Walk Away"".  ""Impossible"" & ""At Last"" were done like I was hoping though.",1104796800,5,1394,4.411764705882353
1945971,5,B0000TWMMA,"I am a self confessed grumpy old man who thought all music finished with Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. My view on contemporary pop stars was: all lip synching and no talent. Then I discovered Christina Aguilera and her DVD 'Stripped'.

Quite simply she is an absolute star. I have never seen such a young woman ooze such quality. She has presence, magnetic charisma and absolutely 'owns' the stage from start to finish.

And then there is her voice...it is stunning, awesome. Her voice is bone shakingly powerful, extremely melodic with an extraordinary range, richness and depth - it is absolutely compelling and simply demands to be listened to. Whether she is belting out a rocker or soulfully caressing a plaintive love lyric it makes my hair stand on end every time.

To sing as she does is magnificent enough, but then to combine it with her wonderfully choreographed dance routines beggars belief. How can she dance like that and yet and sing so beautifully at the same time? The answer is she is that rarity that comes along once in a generation: a true, natural born star!

Oh, and I disagree with a previous reviewer who said that her habit of letting escape a little 'ha' at the end of some of her lines is an off putting quirk. I think it is wonderful and really sweet, as is her habit of tapping the stem of the microphone with her fingers as she sings - so cute!

And when I say 'lot' , inspite of being a predominantly rock fan, I rate this DVD over RHCP's Live from Castle Slane or U2's live from Castle Slane! And we all know that both those concerts deserve 5 stars!

I love the fact that every bit of sound on this DVD is actually live,  and the amount of energy she puts to make it THE most fabulous concert I've ever seen on DVD! The funny thing is, I used to hate Christina before seing this DVD accidentally, and now shes like my bibical touchstone. She is magnificient..she really is. Its cute the way she taps the mic with her fingers all the time (like Eminem), and the outfits she wears are gorgeous, especially the coat she wears in Voice Within.

There is a magnificient version of Cant Hold Us down, and Fighter...well shes rockin it. I love the T-Shirt she wears towards the end of the concert, while singing Beautiful (Her shirt says 'God sees no color",1103068800,2,982,4.297297297297297
1945974,5,B0000TWMMA,"This DVD has long been overdue but was worth the wait. It showcases a full concert which was amazing not only because of the dances and the stage props but because of Christina's voice. Apart from other female musicians, Christina has the voice. This was shown in the DVD, where she effortlessly soars through octaves, not lipsynchin for even a second.

Her performances also were A+. She has this balance in performing where there are just the right amount of effects and talent, unlike other artists like Britney who rely so much on the pyrotechnics, ignoring singing all together.

The performances where also thatrical. It wasn't really that cliche cheesy all dance-number style. She gives fans a lot of different flavors like some times, she goes on hip hop, then a fool out dance, sometimes acounstic, cabaret, or even latin style performances.

She realy showed her stuff. Plus, there are bonuses on the DVD for die hard fans like me to collect!

I love thsi DVD. It stands proof of CHristina's success, which will continue long after Britney is gone hehe",1102723200,,1062,4.850828729281768
1945975,4,B0000TWMMA,"But it was originally supposed to come out Januray 6th, then that got changed to February 12th, and then April 6th, then bla, bla bla. And finally, it came out in October, but didn't come out up here until this week, and I bought it right away. The only problem is, I don't like Christina nearly as much as I did in January, so it's just kinda ok, and I guess I lost my interest, but as I watched the show, I remembered why I liked her. She might be a dirty girl, but at heart, she is still a good person, and I think people tend to forget that. And off stage, she can be pretty much an introvert. She doesn't always blab off every detail of her life, and she tends to keep a lot of things to herself. That's ok, I'm sure lots of people can relate, like me. And this dvd is more then worth it. The concert is highly-energetic, fun and the effects are sparkling.

To begin, we have the Stripped Intro Pt. 1, where she starts getting all sexy and stuff, ready for the big opening.

Dirrty- Vocally, she does a good job on this song, but to be honest, it's not very dirty at all and is well choreographed.

Get Mine, Get Yours- Now this actually does the replacement and is nearly as dirty as the video for Dirrty, I can tell why they wouldn't put this on air a year ago when they had the special on it.

The Voice Within- This is such a pretty song, I am actually going into a festival playing this song only, it's so beautiful and she does a fantastic job. The most dressed you will see her in the entire performance(Beautiful runs a close second)

Genie in A Bottle- Starts out with some Egyptian style dancing, then it comes in with a cool, better version of the song.

Can't Hold Us Down- Sounds way better live then on the cd, with the exception of the absense of Lil' Kim and just her voice recorded over.

Contigo En La Distancia/Falsas Esperanzas- The spanish songs, the first one is slow and pretty, the second one can be heard on the My Reflection dvd concert also, she does an amazing job.

Infatuation- The lyrics are just hot, and the song is great, she does well live, too bad I can't say the same about Britney.

Come on Over(All I want is You)- An acoustic version of it, it's pretty.

Cruz- The Best song on here, on the cd, I wasn't crazy about it, but live, it sounds amazing. She does such a wonderful job.

Impossible- It's nearly the same as the one on the cd, only her vocals aren't as strong.

At Last- And I will have to switch her vocals aren't that strong to her vocals are amazing on this song. She holds one note for like 20 seconds or something, it's astonishing, really well done. I love this song, even though it's a copy of Etta James's song.

Lady Marmalade- This girl can handle anything they give her, she not only sounds great, but dresses so sexy and the whole performance is some of the best work I have ever scene. She is so inventive, well, I'll just say the choreographer is.

Walk Away- Guys should probably AVOID this, male pole dancer, can't get it out of my mind, and trying really hard. Why couldn't Christina have done that? Never mind, it's icky and stuff... I know why they didn't show this in the hour special too.

Fighter- Thank the lord, something that I don't have to cover my eyes with, she rocks on this song. About time, this is by far her best song. It's so cool! Plus all the explosions, this is more like it.

What A Girl Wants- If you like the song, you'll like this. Nough said.

Beautiful- Oh, everyone has to love this song, and she does an amazing job, finishing off in just a regular t-shirt that says, 'God sees no color', and I think that is a very strong message and people need to see that, oh and she is wearing regular jeans too, something she doesn't do to often. She manages to make it look good. This song is perfect for the ending.

Special Features- 4/5 Each thing is about 2-4 minutes long, so it's very brief and gives you very little detail. Still, it's better then an exagerrated version. I've seen making of movies things that take like an hour, and that gets dull and boring, especially if it isn't the actors talking.

Album Stripped- Christina goes on about her album, just mostly her videos.

Stripped Tour- Christina talks about the tour, I think that was obvious in the title.

Her Life- Simple as that. Ps. She likes to sleep during her spare time. That's a smart girl.

Causes outside of music- How she gets involved with the less fortunate.

The Musicians- Pretty funny part to it, actually.

The Dancers

Stylists- He shows how Christina is very impatient during makeup time, and doesn't like to sit around and get here hair done, like most famous people do.

The Choreographer- He goes over how he does the show and stuff

Gilbert's Bus Tour- One of Christina's dancers takes a tour of their bus, pretty small for the amount of people involved, I wouldn't want to live in that.

One Night in Milano- Christina meets Donatella Versace and she talks about Christina a little.

RSVP- Fans ask Christina questions, and she answers them. The best part, really.

 Overall, a good buy for any Christina fan or anyone that wants to see a good choreographed concert!! Plus, she sings and it isn't dubbed over(unlike Hilary's)!!",1102723200,,5210,4.367875647668394
1945976,5,B0000TWMMA,"Christina Aguilera stands head & shoulders above the current crop of young female Singers (Britney, Hilary, Jessica, et al).  Not only is she a better singer than they are, she often writes her own Lyrics - and good ones that actually have something positive to say.  She will be around for a long, long time.  Her ""Stripped"" is one of the most underated CDs of the last 5 Years.  And this CD of her live show in the U.K. only further demonstrates her talent as a Vocalist and Live Performer.  Fans of Christina should check out the new CD by Pop/Rock Recording Artist AMBER - My Kind of World.  Like Christina, Amber is an Original.  She is a fantastic Singer and Songwriter.  Like Stripped, her CD features an ecclectic mix of tracks that cover a lot of musical territory.  The first Single, the Alt Rock infused Electronic ""You Move Me"" hit #1 on XM Radio.  The followup ""Voodoo"" is currently being remixed for an early 2005 Commercial release.  And then there's the Whitney Houston Meets Pat Benatar and ALL-Amber Power Ballad ""Sacrificial Lamb"".  This song is a monster hit waiting to happen.  There are enough Singles here to keep ""My Kind of World in the Charts"" for 2 Years.  My Advice?

the hands down best performance was 'fighter' i love this song... i did not like the song until the video came out and the video was really hot...

the only problem that made this dvd loose points was that redman and lil' kim were not present... if they had them on the back of the dvd case listed then i wanted them to at least be there... also i wish there were some of her STRIPPED videos i.e. 'dirrty', 'can't hold us down', 'the voice within', and of course 'fighter'...

1945990,4,B0000TWMMA,"I think that Christina Aguilera has one of the best voices in music business today. Besides from that she also performs very good on stage. This DVD shows how was Christina's first world tour. The show is very good, has several dancers, the production was flawless and the stage is also good. What I didn't like very much was that Christina cuts some of the songs as the #1 hit ""LADY MARMALADE"". For ""COME ON OVER"" Christina made a very good change taking the song to an unplugged interlude with a little gospel style, ""FIGHTER"" was one of the best songs in he show. For ""WHAT A GIRL WANTS"" you'll see a great introduction. Christina also added a cover, the classic ""AT LAST"", and finally the show ends with ""BEAUTIFUL"". You can find here the best songs of her latest album but the only song missing here was ""I TURN TO YOU"" from her first album from were she sings only the hits.

Besides the show you get as bonus features an interview and some extra footage. What I think that would've been great was to add the music videos of her latest album ""STRIPPED"".",1099526400,27,1059,4.430769230769231

I absolutely loved the DVD, the concert was phenomenal & I loved the special features. I wish I had gone to see her live when she came to Chicago but my friend saw her & said she put on a great show & now seeing it on DVD, I see she was right. Christina Aguilera is part Madonna, part Mariah! She's attention grabbing but has genuine artistic talent. I loved the costumes & aside from being a remarkable vocalist, she's quite a dancer as well! She really seemed to connect with the audience & I think she sang ""At Last"" better than Etta James did. Christina puts all her cotempararies to shame, namely britney who's probably the worst vocalist ever! This was one hot ass show & I totally recommend it to anyone who appreciates a strong set of pipes & wants to see a little eye candy. Go buy it!",1097884800,4,924,4.3468208092485545
1946001,5,B0000TWMMA,"As a child growing up, I followed such great bands as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Queen, Aerosmith and then went on to appreciate great vocalists such as Barbara Streisand, Whitney Houston, and MarcAnthony. All these performers have one thing in common, the ability to perform and sing live.
It's sad to say that some of the most successful acts in recent years that we are forced to watch on TV and listen to on radio cannot sing live. Their success relies mainly on their studio recordings and dancing abilities. When you go to see these so called stars live in Concert, the only live part of their show is the dancing. It's almost like going to a Broadway musical, only; at least the vocal performances in the musical are live. With all this said, I am pleased to inform all of you who read this review that finally, someone in the Pop world put out a truly great live performance.
 This DVD is Christina's first ever-live release and hopefully not her last. The concert was recorded at Wembley Arena in London.  The show incorporated a nice mixture of light show, dance, instruments, and of course Christina's unquestionable great vocals. Most of the songs performed here are from her latest record ""Stripped"".
Considering how beautiful and sexy Christina is, one might think she would needs these assets to sell tickets, but once you hear her first ballad, you realize that she can fill an arena with her vocal abilities alone. Christina takes her audience through a magical roller coaster ride filled with trills and fills only a great vocalist can execute. Rarely have I heard a singer that is capable of changing her voice from full range to falsetto and back without making me cringe.  Moving on, Christina's choice of song and the order in which they were performed did well to keep the audience and viewer glued to the show leaving no opening for a relief break.  My favorite performances of the show were, in order, Impossible, Walk Away, At Last, Beautiful, and finally The Voice Within. Christina performs a wonderful version of, At Last, originally sung by one of her all time favorites, Etta James. Christina also added a little Latin flavor to her show that I found interesting, however she needs some work on her Spanish. Other songs on this DVD include, Dirrty, Get Mine, Get Yours, Genie in a Bottle, Can't hold us Down, Contigo En La Distancia/Falsas Esperanza, Infatuation, Come on Over (All I want Is You), Cruz, Lady Marmalade, Fighter, and What a Girl Wants.
I must admit that before viewing this show, I expected to see stage costumes that were in line with the Video Dirrty, however, to my surprise, most of the costumes for the show were selected in good taste, with the exception of the ones worn during the performances of Dirrty,  Lady Marmalade and maybe one or 2 other songs.  The theatrical part of the show with all the dancing and acting rounded out the show really well.
 Over all I thought the show did what it was intended to do, and what fans expected it to do, and that is, keep the audience rocking, clapping, singing, and just having a great time.

Congratulations Christina, you pulled off a performance like a seasoned veteran, and with style. You get two THUMBS UP, WAY WAY UP!!!!!",1097884800,8,3228,4.710992907801418
1946002,5,B0000TWMMA,"I had the rare opportunity to see ""The Stripped/ Justified Tour"" in its Minneapolis, MN visit (""Justified"" is Justin Timberlake's half).  It was wonderful!  Though nothing beats the live experience, ""Stripped - Live In the UK"" wonderfully desplicts the tour.

From the special effects to the elaborate stage settings to the performers to Christina Aguilera's performance, this concert wonderfully explores another side of her and her music.  Like her latest album ""Stripped"", she proves that she is truly grown up and developing into her own artist.  Those who have seen her previous tours will especially notice this transition.  This growingly fearless artist makes every moment count in her stage presence.

The elaborate special effects give audiences the additional viewing experience, traveling deeper physically into her words and her personal life.  The urban fences, the ""Moulin Rouge"" setting, and the motorcycles are only some aspects that amaze audiences.  The numerous costumes were greatly crafted.  The video clips on the flat screen give these elaborate settings the added flavor.  The back-up musicians and the dancers help accent everything wonderfully.

Christina Aguilera's amazing talents are showcased in every song.  Her musical presence proves that they are as genuine as in her albums.  Audiences can feel her every personal word and emotion through her music, namely when she belts.  Every aspect of her performances fit perfectly with the stage setting.  Even her past hits are changed thematically for the effect while sounding equally amazing.  Her energy through her voice and her physical moves never fade.

""Stripped - Live in the UK"" is a great DVD edition for any Christina Aguilera fan.  This is sure to please many audiences for a long time.  Those with an opportunity to see her live should.",1097798400,4,1828,5.303135888501743

Christina has such an amazing voice and is so wonderfully talented.  She sings EVERY song live without the aid of tracks (no lip-syncing)!! I saw her in concert when she came to the Pepsi Centre and the only thing that was different was that on the DVD she sings ""Cruz"" instead of ""Make Over"" as she did when I saw her.  All in all though, The concert is great as well as the DVD extras.  It's just another amazing output from Miss Aguilera.

1946005,4,B0000TWMMA,"If Britney Spears had a voice worth showcasing live, she could take a few tips from Christina.  For example, the QUALITY of singing is more important than the QUANTITY of dance moves.  Christina's own choreography is certainly attention-getting enough to maintain the audience's interest, but it is not so extensive that she has to lip-synch to keep from ruining her vocal performance.

In this captivating concert, Christina makes it obvious that she is really the best pop performer in the world.  Her integration of hip-hop, R&B, blues, country, Latin dance, and rock into one seamless concert is outstanding.  For the most part, her interpretation is extremely effective and shows true versatility and a genuine love for music, in general.  Her outstanding voice remains the focus throughout the concert, although the stage show is also very impressive.

I enjoy the ""'Dirrty' twist"" put on her pop princess breakthrough single, ""Genie In A Bottle"".  It's a clever way of burning the ""innocence bridge"" behind her.  ""Walk Away"" is a very addictive performance, as well (unless seeing a guy dance extremely seductively makes you uncomfortable).  ""Cruz"" and ""Fighter"" seem to be her rock features in the concert, and she performs both of them very convincingly (the choreography really does work in ""Fighter"", even though it's a rock song).  I, personally, prefer her live interpretation of ""Impossible"" over the one that was chosen (probably through much cutting-and-pasting) for the album.  It sounds much more Alicia Keys-like (which is a good thing!).  I think that ""Beautiful"" was the perfect choice to end the concert with.  It's a simple song with a great message, and she performs it very personably (if you've seen the concert, you know what I mean).

In actuality, I'd like to give this DVD 4.5 stars out of 5.  My complaints are small, but enough to keep me from wanting to give the DVD a perfect score.  First of all, I think that the syntehsizer used in ""Dirrty"" takes away from the grit that the album version possesses.  The bass and drum set are awesome, but the synthesizer just doesn't work.  I also think riding the big pink motorcycle in ""Can't Hold Us Down"" gives the performance a little too much ""girl power kick"" for it's own good.  Also, although I remember being blown-away by ""At Last"" when I went to see her concert, I am not quite as entertained by it, now.  I don't know if she interpreted it differently on the US tour, but I think she uses too much melisma at the beginning and makes it hard to hear the key the song is in.  The end of the song is still golden, though, so I can't complain too much.  Finally, it seems that Christina has become particularly fond of randomly ending her phrases with a short ""ha!"" tagged on at the end.  I don't know if she has a reason for doing this or if it's just a random quirk, but it doesn't sit well in my ears.

Overall, a great concert given by a truly gifted artist.  Let's hope this one can stick around for the longrun.",1097539200,10,2998,4.717307692307692
1946006,4,B0000TWMMA,"Upon buying the DVD, I will say that the performances of Make Over & I Prefer You weren't added into the final tracklisting, or not at least the one released in my country.

The overall concert is quite energetic and powerful with the main focus on Christina and her powerful voice, while most of the performances were great I just felt that the ""Genie In A Bottle (Arabian Remix)"" was a little short and could've been extended with more of Christina singing the whole song instead of breaking it into a dancing performance but nonetheless the remix and the performance was fantastic. On another note every single song Christina performs is live, there isn't any lip-synching even when she is dancing while singing, this should be a big credit to her for an artist who can maintain an entertaining performance and yet keep up with good vocals.

The additional features on the DVD are mainly comprised of interview segments with Christina herself, her backing vocal performers & her dancers and the production of the Stripped Tour. There is also an interesting segment called ""One Night In Milano"" where Christina meets Donatella Versace and another where Christina takes questions from her fans. Other additional features include facts and figures about the tour, a guide to Christina's make-up & wardrobe and a text/photo gallery. The overall features on this DVD is a lot but it seemed to be have been missing something, perhaps it was the music videos she had done for her singles off the Stripped album that was not present on the DVD.

While Christina may sometimes make interesting headlines and constantly changing her image or wear outfits that are like from adult films, there is no doubt she has an amazing talent of singing with proving how powerful her vocals can be, stand out performances below that show these are

1946017,4,B0000TWMMA,I saw the Justified/Stripped tour twice and both times Christina was great. Not just vocally but the performance was great. One complaint - the show was exactly the same both times right down to the times she talked to the audience. After seeing a reviewers set order it looks like it will be the same yet again. That's okay though she was still awesome and it will definately be worth owning.,1097020800,,393,4.549295774647887

1946020,5,B0000TWMMA,"Although I have not yet seen the DVD, I'm certin it will be worth 5-stars, just for the reason it features the hottest concert I've seen. I went to go see the ""Justifed and Stripped Tour"" when it came to my hometown, and I loved it. Christina Aguilera not only featured great musical acts but showed us her  powerful voice, which is also the best voice in music right now. Although she might not be as good as a dancer as Britney, she showed us creative, original and fun sets, as well as her amazing voice. And while watching a Britney concert you're stuck with bad lip singing and old rip-offed Madonna material. So you if want to watch a truly great performer, pick up this DVD.",1093305600,4,681,4.362204724409449

1946033,5,B0000TWMMA,"Christina Aguilera has been able to prove to us that she is the next Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, and Whitney Houston combined. Her unique voice has touched many of her fans, including myself, in so many ways unexplained. When she toured the U.S. with The Stripped Tour 2003, she was paired with Justin Timberlake (of *NSYNC), who was touring for his first solo album, JUSTIFIED (2003), calling the tour, The Justified Stripped Tour 2003. But when the left the U.S. to tour Europe, they toured separately. August 8th, 2003 was the night I went to see Justin and Christina. Justin was outstanding, but I didn't quite enjoy it as much as I did with Christina, basically because I didn't know too much of his solo songs. As far as Christina is concerned, she was amazing. Her voice always gave me the chills, but not like that night. What you see on this UK performance of Christina's concert is the same as the one she gave in the U.S., when she and Justin were on The Justified Stripped Tour 2003.

  The show starts off with the STRIPPED INTRO playing. There was a video to go along with it, but I didn't see because my seats were in the last row and on the side. After the STRIPPED INTRO, Christina came out to open the show with DIRRTY, wearing a tight black outfit, with a touch purple, orange, and red on it, complete with her new black hair. She swept through DIRRTY like there was no tomorrow. After DIRRTY, she performed a great rendition of GET MINE, GET YOURS. After GET MINE, GET YOURS, she performed THE VOICE WITHIN and she sang it more beautifully than the album version.

  She went back-stage for a costume change, while Arabian music was played. She came out in a black leather coatdress to perform GENIE IN A BOTTLE. After the short Arabian remix of GENIE IN A BOTTLE performance, she performed CAN'T HOLD US DOWN, while her female dancers thrashed sexual moves over motorcycles. Lil' Kim did not make an appearance, her rap was simply given from the album, while Christina performed the song overtop of the album version, while the band played the live music overtop of the album version. After CAN'T HOLD US DOWN, a caged fence was moved in front of Christina, as she performed an even harder rock version of the already made rock version of MAKE OVER.

  After MAKE OVER, Christina went back-stage for her second costume change, while her dancers gave a Latino dance to a previously recorded Spanish song Christina had recorded called, CONTIGO EN LA DISTANCIA/FALSAS ESPERANZAS. Christina finally came out, wearing a red Spanish 1930s waltzing dress, complete with pink shoes, to perform INFATUATION. After INFATUATION, she grabbed a stole and sat down to have a conversation with her audience. When I saw her here in South Philly, she talked to us about how she had been so happy to be back in Philly, since she performed here four years earlier for her first tour. Then she started asking her female audience if they had a crush on Justin, which led into an acoustic performance of COME ON OVER BABY (ALL I WANT IS YOU). She then performed her Alicia Keys composed song, IMPOSSIBLE. She finished up IMPOSSIBLE and then took centerstage. She said that the next to songs she was about to sing were two of her favorite songs from Etta James, one of her favorite female solo artists. The first Etta James cover Christina sang was the infamous AT LAST. The second Etta James cover Christina sang was I PREFER YOU.

  After her Etta James renditions, she went for another costume change. The stage lights came on to reveal a French 17th century set, with her female dancers dressed up in French 17th century risqu outfits, while the sound of fingersnapping is heard. Suddenly, in a cappella, are the words, HEY SISTER, GO SISTER, SOUL SISTER, FLOW SISTER. Yep, that's right, Christina came out to perform LADY MARMALADE. Even though, it wasn't the same without, Mya, Lil' Kim, and Pink, Christina did a great job singing it herself. She only performed Mya's verse and then skipped over Pink's verse and Lil' Kim's verse to sing her verse and closed the song out. After her dancers left, Christina stepped inside a tall glass box with one of her male dancers to perform WALK AWAY, where at the end of the song, the dancer was stripped down to his boxers.

  After WALK AWAY, Christina took another costume change, while a video was playing to STRIPPED PT. 2, and again, I didn't see the video. Christina finally came out in a tight black, one-piece tank-top suit, with fringes alongside, complete with some pink coloring around it, to perform FIGHTER. This was a song I have been waiting for the whole show. After FIGHTER, she performed an amazing rendition of WHAT A GIRL WANTS. Just when you thought the show was over, she came out to perform the encore, which was BEAUTIFUL. Stop thinking that I'm going to tell you the encores. I've been generous with telling you the whole show, you're on own with finding out how the encore went, so buy it and see how it went. Below is the setlist for Christina's portion of The Justified Stripped Tour 2003, which is also the same setlist for The Stripped UK Tour 2003.

1946036,5,B0000TWMMA,"I was at this show and was in possibly the best seat in the house - eight rows back, right beside the end of the walkway (where she seemed to perform a lot of the songs).  Christina was in amazing voice, she looked great, the set was fantastic, and the show as a whole was slick and professional - a far cry from Beyonce's concert at this venue a week later (see the reviews of her DVD to read about that shambles).
I had watched MTV's ""Making The Tour - Justin & Christina"" before I went to see this show (having already seen the Trousersnake performing at Wembley in May) so I had seen Xtina getting seriously stressed about her quick changes.  Well, she needn't have worried as they were amazing.  One minute she would be throwing her body and voice around in front of me, then she'd run off backstage (in immense heels!!!) and reappear moments later in a totally different skin-tight outfit.  There were no prolonged dance-breaks or absences from the stage to kill the atmosphere, and I didn't sit down once.  All the tracks were really good, but for me her performance of ""Fighter"" was a stand-out moment (and it seemed like it got the biggest roar of approval from the audience).  I also loved ""Get Mine Get Yours"", whilst her 50s-chic Etta James section was brilliant.  ""Dirrty"" was the perfect song to get us all going at the beginning whilst ""Beautiful"" was a fantastic ending to the show.
This was an outstanding concert, and one that I wish I could watch again on DVD.  (...)",1082678400,6,1486,4.4981412639405205

1946053,5,B0000TWMMA,"The sexy singer took to touring for a Stripped tour. In the US, due to the bad market taken over by people who are apparently no longer interested in seeing concerts, she had to co-headline with the vocally disabled Justin Timberlake. Overseas, however, the show was her own and she sold out every date (much unlike her tour with Justin) and made much more money.
This particular DVD features content from one of her dozens of sold out overseas shows, and is from Europe, the continent she's most popular in. Being the larger-than-life Elvis-like Goddess she is there, it's no wonder they'd use that footage for this particular showing.
The pros: The majority of her fans (which reside in Europe) get a closer to home performance. Additionally, all her fans from elsewhere in the world get a song she didn't perform outside Europe (""Cruz"") as well as a stage set-up slightly different from the concerts that occured outside Europe. DVD features exclusive behind-the scenes looks at things. Not to mention the AMAZING film and effects of the whole thing. You'll feel like you're there!
The cons: Christina's voice is not at its best on here. She's a bit showy. Anyone who saw the WB special that previews much of this DVD's highlight performance knows that she screamed out in several of them in some weird Jamaican voice. She even forgot the words to songs and had to improvise in about 2 performances shown. It would be assumed there's much more, judging the WB only showed like 7 performances of 15.
Additional info:
I attended the final Los Angeles concert at the Staples Center- the 3rd of 3 dates. Each date, she had special A-list guests coming on stage to perform with her, and those were the only dates to the tour that immediately sold out. At my particular show, Pamela Anderson came out to perform ""Lady Marmalade"" with her in what was the song's best performance ever- if not the best performance of ANYTHING ever. At other people's show, she had Dave Navarro, among others, collaborate on songs with her. Why couldn't she have the performances with these special guests? They were clearly highlights from her tour. In the performance of ""Lady Marmalade"" used on this DVD, they carry around an empty couch on the stage. Looks mighty lonely without Pamela Anderson dancing on it.
At my particular show, she was vocally perfect. However, I must say the Stripped In London version of ""What A Girl Wants"" was AMAZING and the best performance of that song EVER. It was so fun and such an amazing celebration showing that Christina can be your giddy, exciting girl next door if she chooses. It totally made you feel like you were there. Additionally, this DVD's version of ""Dirrty"" is just as amazing as the version I saw in concert.
I do wish they would have made the Japanese tour available as well, though. For that tour, she dyed her hair red and wore totally different outfits that SHE MADE HERSELF for half the set, and even did a few different songs and performed things with different choreography and lyrics (to insure that nothing went against Asia's strict concert rules). Would've been interesting to show some of those performances with this.
It's also interesting to note that the Stripped tour isn't over yet, and will continue after this DVD is finally releases. She plans on promoting a Stripped In South America tour, which will likely not make DVD. Couldn't they have waited? The South American tour will feature some new outfits and sets, as well as a few of the Spanish versions of Stripped songs performed (""Get Mine Get Yours,"" ""Infatuation"") and I'm sure stuff from her upcoming Spanish album set to be released at around that time.
You do have to give credit where credit is due: the entire DVD uses an amazing and innovative way of looking at performances. The coloring is altered and makes it look mega cool. The most amazing viewing of a concert you can possibly have on your television. This video definitely deserves all 5 of the stars I'm giving it, and Christina herself deserves them as well.

She opens with the sexually-charged ""Dirrty,"" coming out in a black catsuit with red tape over her breasts and lower areas.  She then moves into ""Get Mine, Get Yours"" which is another great performance.  Then the empowering ""The Voice Within"" which she performs flawlessly.  She then remixes her first hit ""Genie In A Bottle,"" then goes into ""Can't Hold Us Down"" minus the motorcycle she rode onstage during her US Tour.  After CHUD, she performs ""Make Over.""  Then she does her latin section ""Contigo En La Distanci/Falsas Esperanzas"" and ""Infatuation"" followed by an acoustic version of ""Come On Over Baby.""  Then she does a tribute to one of her idols - Etta James, by singing ""At Last"" (which is AMAZING) and ""I Prefer You.""  Then she does ""Lady Marmalade"" minus Lil Kim, Mya, and Pink.  Then ""Walk Away"" and ""Fighter.""  Followed by ""What A Girl Wants.""  She then comes out in a simple teeshirt which reads ""God Sees No Color"" and a pair of jeans, and performs the number one hit ""Beautiful.""
