8104810,3,B000E370SI,"I would like to give this product a great review but the disc malfunctioned. It skipped every 30 seconds or so. I could not hear important information because of this. I plan to return the DVD to get another one. The content of the DVD is very interesting so I would like to hear ALL of it. After I have a better disc, then I will feel better about rating the product.",1142208000,,368,4.125
