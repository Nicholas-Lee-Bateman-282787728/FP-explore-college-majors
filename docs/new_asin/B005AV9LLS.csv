8463689,3,B005AV9LLS,"Some persons reviewing this unauthorized DVD release of the British pop and rock and roll music television show ""Ready Steady Go!"" had their facts wrong here. Primarily, I would like to correct the assumption just because an item is available for sale on Amazon.com does not mean it is ""okay"" and legitimate. Amazon sells so much merchandise it cannot be expected to know every single item is authorized and legitimate or not.

Back in the 1980s Dave Clark, the British businessman and former (live) drummer of The Dave Clark Five rock and roll outfit which bore his name, purchased the rights to the beloved pop-rock music showcase television series ""Ready Steady Go!."" one of the few extant properties of the former Associated-Rediffusion (later known as Rediffusion, London) network. But as with his own rock group, The DC5, at least some of the songs of which were not composed by Clark even though he paid others to give him composing credits, as well that Clark did not play on all or some of the band's studio recordings (because he was a perfunctory drummer who played only at The DC5's live gigs), there was also some disingenuousness regarding The DC5's appearances in these ""RSG!"" programs. It is very obvious (when one watches these programs) Clark had The DC5's appearances in the show inserted in-between actual program segments, since The DC5 segments are brighter and videotaped while the other RSG! segments are dimmer and kinescoped (filmed from a TV monitor). Or at least that is what was seen in the three VHS compilations of ""RSG!"" released in the mid-to-late 1980s. That said, I have read The DC5 actually did appear in some ""RSG!"" programs. So perhaps some of those appearances might be included in this DVD compilation and would be the actual DC5 segments from ""Ready Steady Go!""

In any case, I wouldn't ordinarily encourage (at least not in a public forum) persons to  purchase unauthorized and bootleg products, at least not without having first evaluated such products for myself. But since Mr. Clark has been dishonest in his handling of the production for this fondly remembered British music TV series, plus that Clark has taken his sweet old time releasing ""RSG!"" in a DVD or other digital format (such as by streaming on Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, etc.), I think it is highly unlikely by this point Clark will ever release ""RSG!"" again on home video and would advise those who really wish to have this great music TV series in their collection to get whatever they may while they can, so long as the product is at least watchable and listenable. And by what at least some of the reviewers here have written, it seems this bootleg ""RSG!"" DVD collection are simply episodes  from off-cable TV recordings, likely recorded when ""RSG!"" was cablecast on the Disney Channel in the mid-1990s, when that cable network was a premium service and Clark had actually recorded then-new wrap hosting segments for those newer TV showings on Disney.

So I say ""Ready Steady Go!"" for it!!!

P.S.--If I were more organized in my life, I actually have all those Disney Chanel episodes of ""RSG!"" (with the newer Dave Clark intros) on a set of VHS tapes myself, sitting in my storage room. Someday, perhaps, if I am able to have my DVD recorder (with dual DVD-VHS dubbing feature) repaired or else obtain a new VHS-to-DVD dubbing unit, I plan to record those rare ""RSG!"" episodes for myself.

As I recall, besides the complete episodes of ""RSG!"" the Disney Channel showings also included the three ""best of"" anthologies previously released in VHS format and available from retail sources. But if one is knowledgeable about such matters and sufficiently industrious, all or some of those ""RSG!"" anthologies are also available from p2p file-sharing torrents. And at least The Beatles', Otis Redding and The Rolling Stones' Special Editions of ""RSG!"" are uploaded to YouTube, from where one may download with some free software. Some of ""Ready Steady Go! - Special Edition ~ ""The Sounds of Motown,"" hosted by British pop-soul singer Dusty Springfield, is also on YouTube, but not in its entirety. But one may find copies of that title as well other ""RSG!"" titles here on Amazon and elsewhere (eBay, iOffer, specialty websites) online.

While I am here, for those unaware, take a listen to the terrific Generation X (1970s punk rock band) tune ""Ready Steady Go!"" The song (featuring a young Billy Idol on lead vocals) is a perfect audible homage to the fondly remembered Brit TV pop music show and its most famous hostess (besides occasional ""guest presenter"" Miss Springfield), the then-in-her-early-20's Cathy McGowan. McGowan epitomized much of what was was ""fab"" and ""gear"" in ""Swinging London"" of the early-to-mid 1960s, so at the forefront she even influenced later fashion icons such as the actress and former fashion model Leslie ""Twiggy"" Hornby. McGowan helped popularize fashion maven Mary Quant's mini-skirt, as well the later maxi skirt and heavy use of eye make-up (the most prominent exponent of which was Dusty ""Raccoon Eyes"" Springfield) but minimal other face make-up. McGowan also spoke in a rather posh and uptown style widely imitated, as well the then-current teen slang which endeared her to an entire generation of young British adults.

Anyway, have a listen to ""Ready Steady Go!"" by Generation X. Had only that tune been composed and recorded about 13 years previous, it most certainly could have been the official theme of the ""RSG!"" TV show instead of the other two tunes (""Wipe Out"" by The Surfaris and Manfred Mann's ""5-4-3-2-1"")  used the most at the time, to let the kids know ""The Weekend Starts Here."".",1509753600,,5638,4.937763713080169

This DVD is definitely worth watching and worth owning as a keepsake to remember a time when variety shows were good clean entertaining fun.
As a child of the 60's I just felt incredibly lucky to experience a show of icons of the 60s,with loved new acts and some discoveries too. The house band was great under Spike Edney's skillful leadership and the backing vocalists helped create a great sound.
Thanks for offering this, Amazon. Its a keeper...",1361318400,,604,4.761904761904762
