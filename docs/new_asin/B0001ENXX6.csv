8011419,4,B0001ENXX6,"I'm a professional touring guitarist as well as a clinician, and a big Mike Stern fan. I liked hearing Mike talk about his approach to playing, and the examples that he gives are really useful. This is not a lesson DVD as much as it is an interview with performance shots and explanations about what he is doing. You can definitely walk away with a few new licks and useful ideas. As I find with most videos, if you learn only one useful thing from it, it is an incredible value.",1197417600,2,479,4.274725274725275
8011420,5,B0001ENXX6,"This is not really an instructional video, only that it does have the tab for all the songs, and you do get to see Mike and the band play them in a club in NY, which is cool. Mike also talks about his influences, how he plays what he plays, and also you get the run down on his guitar and equipment, amps, cabs, speakers, etc. So this is more of a watch and read instructional dvd then an actual dvd where Mike sets down and shows you step by step everything. I really like it, but I wish Mike would put out a more instructional dvd where you can see what he does close up, split screen, etc. Hey, any Mike Stern is good Mike Stern....",1190678400,3,635,4.0078740157480315
8011421,1,B0001ENXX6,As a guitar instructional video this Mike Stern's DVD is very poor. It teaches almost nothing. If I knew it I wouldn't buy it!,1173312000,2,126,4.291666666666667
8011422,5,B0001ENXX6,This is a great look at Mike Stern and his playing.  Perfect for any fan or guitarist.,1143072000,2,86,4.0588235294117645
