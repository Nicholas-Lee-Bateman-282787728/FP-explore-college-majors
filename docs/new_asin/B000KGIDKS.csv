8540254,1,B000KGIDKS,"First off the film is fine low budget action/Sci Fi flick starring Blue Demon but the problem here is this cheap bootleg by EastWest Entertainment is incomplete.  What's missing you ask?  Why it's the ending, about the last ten minutes of the film are completely missing on this DVD so there's no point in watching this crummy version because it will leave you hanging.  There is an official DVD from Mexico available which is complete of course but sadly for those of you who don't speak Spanish there aren't any subtitles available on that release same is the case with this cheap bootleg.",1231459200,5,591,4.718446601941747
