8386666,5,B00316Q4ZK,"An amazing tour-de-force for star Emil Jannings as an aging circus star. The music is brilliant and the restoration sublime. If you're a fan of silent film, German film, or circus films, this is a worthy addition to your collection.",1505952000,2,232,4.825
8386667,3,B00316Q4ZK,"I really don't know why a better copy of this classic film has not yet been released. It is one of the best films to have ever come out of that ""German Expressionist"" school, in my opinion anyway, a true classic, with Emil Jannings even. It should be put out in a KINO release that would give it the respect that the film deserves, like KINO has done so well with so many other silent films. But at least we have this until they do put it out on a KINO release",1451606400,5,460,4.010869565217392
8386668,5,B00316Q4ZK,Very fine.,1423612800,,10,4.5
8386669,3,B00316Q4ZK,"Any film fan should see this evocation of an obsessed trapeze artist, and Emil Jannings captures a man in the clenches of his own obsession. The camera work by Karl Freund is spectacular. The Blue Angel does a better job with the cuckold story. Even though the retaliation doesn't come at the expected moment, it arrives without the impact it needs.",1356912000,4,349,4.737704918032787
8386670,1,B00316Q4ZK,"While this film is one of the classics from the German silent film era, for some unaccountable (to me) reason, it has never been released (or renovated) in a watchable DVD version.  And this is no exception.  It is a terrible transfer. Especially inexcusable when so many better quality film versions exist from which an acceptable transfer could have been made.",1347408000,15,362,4.918032786885246
8386671,5,B00316Q4ZK,"Like the best parts of life this movie is a tale of desire, jealousy, betrayal and stage performers. Unlike (surprisingly) the vast majority of movies, the camera actually operates like an eye with a highly functioning and interesting brain attached to it and directing its movements. Human life, its places and objects and rooms, when seen through this filter of intelligence, gains such weight and meaning as is ordinarily inaccessible, if not in fact lacking. Though hard, perilous, and a great strain on any kind of stability on one's emotional life, the life of a troupe of vagabond performers, as so many classic films demonstrate, exert a great romantic appeal on bourgeois cinephiles, the innate physicality of this kind of life suggesting both heightened authenticity and sensuality, which are the two components of an interesting life usually most elusive to bourgeois cinephiles.

I am not knowledgeable about technical DVD quality. This seems pretty good to me, though the design, packaging and overall presentation are very basic. There are no extras, though I must admit I am not usually a fanatic for extras--the only DVD commentaries I have ever made it all the way through were those for Les Enfants du Paradis and Double Indemnity.",1271635200,14,1249,5.122549019607843
