8301003,4,B001F42D8W,"the forearm/tricep hits i already knew - you can easily find them on youtube. ive never had someone break down the bopping/forward leg pop technique to me before so that was interesting. Ive never had neck popping broken down and explained to me before like that either so that was good, i liked that. The chest pop i found ok, he couldve specified which muscles he was contracting, rather than just mention ""shoudlerblades"", could be a little misleading. Is he contracting his lats? who knows? maybe its not that important. I like this guy's passion for helping people understand , so maybe his knowledge of anatomy/muscles could match that passion.
I didn't like the drills, i know they were just a bonus and not really meant for a beginner...but why include them on a basic level hitting DVD?  The drills were all very much in HIS style, you couldn't really understand it on a basic level, I couldn't really see/understand the angles he's hitting, they're HIS dance, not boogaloo, not basic fresno...Anyway, rant over. The DVD isn't cheap either but thats the free market i suppose. MY MAIN ISSUE WAS THE FACT THAT I HAD TO PAY AN 11.98 CUSTOMS CHARGE FROM THE POST OFFICE!! I KNOW IM IN THE UK BUT WAS THERE A WARNING ABOUT THIS EXTRA FEE I HAD TO PAY???? (maybe there was and i didn't see it, i don't think there was though)",1348617600,,1329,4.584033613445378
