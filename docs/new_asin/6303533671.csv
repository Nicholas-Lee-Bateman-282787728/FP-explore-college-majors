669766,3,6303533671,"The Mini-Specials are, sadly, the least enjoyable part of the You're Under Arrest franchise.  While they are not bad, they suffer from a lack of creative energy and from their structure: these are truly ""mini"" episodes, lasting only a few minutes.  Briefly, You're Under Arrest focuses on two unorthodox female police officers in Tokyo, with a large and likeable cast of weirdos (police and civilian alike) around them.  If you haven't already gotten into the show, you don't want to start here--these mini-specials would be even less enjoyable not knowing who the characters are.
For those who do know You're Under Arrest, the problems are simple.  First, much of YUA's charm comes from the interaction between the characters.  That's severely hampered by the brevity of these mini-specials--the characters don't have much time to do anything other than charge through the miniscule plot that covers the few minutes allotted.  Second, the episodes don't have much life to them.  The fanservice and perverted elements are made much stronger here versus the show--there are multiple underwear thieves, peeping tom cameramen, and flashers on this one disc.  There just isn't much else here, and because it's so single-mindedly fanservice oriented, it just lacks the charm of the TV episodes.
In sum, then, if you're a completist and have the rest of YUA, you might want to get this, particularly if you liked the more limited fanservice elements of the TV episodes.  If you haven't checked out YUA, you should, but not via these mini-specials.  Look at the TV series (or the original comic).",1063929600,6,1589,5.100386100386101
669767,5,6303533671,"Some anime series have it all.  Case in point:  ""You're Under Arrest!"", based on the super-cool comic series of the same name by the legendary Kosuke Fujishima.  Beautiful female lead characters?  Check.  Heart-thumpin' action?  Check.  Interesting plot twists?  Yup.  Humor?  You bet.  I could go on, but neither of us have all day, do we?  The bottom line is, this is one of the slickest OVA series ever produced.  The story starts out with a pair of female police officers who find out they're partners after one busts the other for reckless driving on the way to her first day on the job.  Needless to say, they get off on sort of the wrong foot at first, but later on they put on an excellent display of teamwork in catching a runaway ""terrorist"".  It's made all the more exciting with one of the most well-animated car chases in the business.  The animation and writing teams did a wonderful job of capturing Fujishima's passion for vehicles of all kinds and attention to detail was right on par with the comic.  The animation itself is nearly flawless; clean and fluid, the way an OVA should be.  The ""Starsky-and-Hutch""-ish soundtrack is a nice touch as well.  I'd highly recommend this series for any anime fan, and this is a good place to start for those just getting into anime as well.  Word of caution, though; now that all four episodes are available on one tape, the ""Criminally Complete Collection"" would be a wiser choice (and you'd save a few bucks, too!)",980121600,4,1473,4.635658914728682

7849336,5,6303533671,When I finished the YOU'RE UNDER ARREST box sets I wanted more. Lucky I came across this.  Rather than your traditional half hour episodes it made up of a mess of short cartoons like you use to find in the old Looney Tunes/Tex AVery days.  Short episodes or not there ever bit as good as the normal episodes with enough stories to cover all of the manga based anime police team of stars.  Unlike the TV series box sets its a bit more crude about bringing up Aoi as a cross dresser and several stories focus on the classic japan comedy bit about taking women under wear which also surprise me when comparing to the more cleaner type of comedy the TV series and OVA has. neither as crude as the jokes used in the adult American cartoons of today.,1389830400,,744,4.3

7849340,4,6303533671,"I can easily remember watching the early ""You're Under Arrest"" (Taiho Shichauzo) OVA's when they were released on LaserDisc back in 1994. It was a special time as fans gravitated towards the animated series which was created by Kosuke Fujishima, know for creating the anime series ""Ah! My Goddess"". Because of the popularity of ""Ah! My Goddess"", people were excited for his latest series which is based on a manga that he released earlier in his career.

The series has always been a humorous take on two police officers: The action-driven, very strong and easy to anger Natsumi Tsujimoto (short hair) and the very polite and very smart Miyuki Kobayakawa (long black hair) and their adventures of wanting to take on criminals on the roads and not just being female officers issuing tickets.

Throughout the last decade, ""You're Under Arrest"" fans have been treated with several OVA's, specials, a movie and television series, and watch as these two complete opposites become the best of friends through their teamwork.

In 2001, ""You're Under Arrest"" was given a second season (the last season finished in 1997) titled ""You're Under Arrest: Fast & Furious"" and was released in 2009/2010 in the U.S. by Sentai Filmworks and now the latest season titled ""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"" which aired in Japan in 2007/2008 gets its release in the US from Sentai Filmworks.

The first volume of ""You're Under Arrest: Fast & Furious"" features the first 12-episodes and focuses on the officers who work at the traffic division of the Bokutou Police Department. The series is directed by Koichi Ohata  (""Burst Angel: Infinity"", ""Genocyber"", ""Ikkitousen"") and series composition by Natsuko Takahashi (""Aquarion"", ""Bleach"", ""Romeo x Juliet"").  Character designs are by Atsuko Nakajima (""Ranma 1/2', ""Ah! My Goddess"", ""Fatal Fury""), art direction by Shigemi Ikeda (""Black Cat"", ""El Hazard: The Wanderers"", ""Inuyasha"", ""Bubblegum Crisis"") and mechanical design by Shunji Murata (""You're Under Arrest"", ""Kimagure Orange Road"", ""Mouse"").

In ""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"", things have changed a little since the last series of ""You're Under Arrest"".  Miyuki has been undergoing profile training, Natsumi has been going through ranger training with the Self Defense Force, Saori has transferred to a new job and everyone else is doing fine at their job.  But with Miyuki returning back home after being gone after training, more adventures are in store for Miyuki, Natsumi and the police officers of the Bokuto Police Department.

VIDEO:

If you have been following ""You're Under Arrest"" for a long time, you'll notice that ""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"" has gone through a little upgrade.  For the part, a new series featuring better and vibrant animation but most importantly, it appears Atsuko Nakajima's character designs have changed to show how much Miyuki, Natsumi and the others have matured.  I am a big fan of Nakajima's work but for ""You're Under Arrest"", her character designs are probably the best I have seen of this series.  Actually, the animation and artistic backgrounds for ""Full Throttle"" is better than any of the previous seasons.

The series is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and for the most part, the series is vibrant with a lot of colors and like the previous seasons, a good amount of detail in the neighborhoods and areas where the ladies patrol.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Audio is Japanese only and in stereo while subtitles are in English. So, it's a front channel driven soundtrack but I preferred to watch the series with my receiver set with stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape. Voice acting is well done and it helps when you have seiyuu veterans Akiko Hiramatsu (she did the voice of Nene Romanova for ""Bubblegum Crisis"", Miyabi in ""Ai Yori Aoshi"", Haruko in ""Slam Dunk"") and Sakiko Tamagawa (Sophia Belin in ""Aquarion"", Tachikoma of ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" and Kazuma-Kun's mother of ""Crayon Shin Chan"").

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle - Collection 1' comes with the clean opening and closing themes on disc 2.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"" is a fun and enjoyable series.  For those who have watched the previous seasons, the first question that many will ask is if the series has changed or has anything progressed since the first OVA series over 15-years-ago and the answer is not much.  The main storyline is pretty much the ladies going after criminals and doesn't really deviate from that storyline.

Since the last season which introduced more characters and involved storylines involving those characters, ""Full Throttle"" does the same in introducing storylines that revolve around Yoriko and Aoi.  Unfortunately, with Saori Saga now in the Cyber Crimes Division, she no longer has a presence in this series and it seems that the direction is to bring things back to storylines that focus on Miyuki and Natsumi and the two being partners.

I will say that I was a bit surprised by the closing theme  which was very ""yuri-like"" as if Miyuki and Natsumi featured as if they were much closer than partners.  Could it be a hint for the future for these two women?  Hmm...

Overall, ""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"" is a fun and enjoyable series.  There were some episodes that were quite serious in tone as Miyuki protecting a young boy to a storyline about a woman leaving her kid in the car (in Japan, there are constant news stories of young parents leaving their children inside the cars or leaving them alone at home while they went shopping, pachinko playing or Internet cafes).  But for the most part, the episodes were more of Miyuki and Natsumi taking on the criminals or rivals and the first 12-episodes remained faithful to the usual YUA storyline.

But I hope to see the second part of the season deviate and show a more serious tone.  Similar to ""You're Under Arrest: Fast & Furious"" when Miyuki and Natsumi's friendship were tested, one can only think what the writer has in store for these ladies (and again, if the ending theme is a hint... perhaps we will see these two protagonists because a loving couple or just partner) in future episodes.  A good start for the season and I look forward to the second and final part of ""You're Under Arrest: Full Throttle"".",1270512000,2,6314,5.003824091778203
7849341,3,6303533671,"Well, the Mini-Specials are far better than the movie with its dark tone, but there's still something missing in the series. It's like the magic the OAV's had has never quite been recaptured in the TV series, movie, or mini-specials. To be sure, You're Under Arrest works much better in small doses. However, towards the end, the Mini-Specials grow redundant (how many times can they crack jokes about people seeing the cross dressing officer's ""thingie""?) and the plots never vary much from their formulas of panty thieves and/or teaching egotistical citizens a lesson (although the designers come up with good ideas to change the settings and scenarios slightly). Although it has good animation and voice acting, I think I had already seen everything that Miyuki and Natsumi would see in their daily lives before I watched this.",1154736000,,830,5.065693430656935
7849342,3,6303533671,"This DVD has the 5-minute shorts (20 episodes) that comprise the ""You're Under Arrest Specials"" series.  The final episode in this series was a full-length episode which is included in the AnimEigo collection (last DVD of box-set four).  For those of you who enjoyed the AnimEigo English dub of the series, you are in luck.  ADV used the same company, so the dub cast is the same.
As to the shorts, there's really not a lot one can do with five minutes. So instead, we get a lot of stuff with Miyuki and Natsumi solving petty crimes, primarily involving panty thieves, peekers, and the like.  This is due to the increased fanservice in the series.  If you want to see Miyuki, Natsumi, or the others in states of undress, well here's your chance.  Personally I don't like fanservice so I whack the series for that.  But in addition, the series weakens Miyuki by making her a screamer.  Yeah, she's afraid of ghost stories, but in ""You're Under Arrest"" (AnimEigo) and ""You're Under Arrest 2"" (unlicensed a/o this review), she doesn't scream like this.  Miyuki also becomes very sadistic in this series.  She electrocutes people on three occassions.
On the plus side, there are laughs to be had in this DVD.  Even though it was the sadistic Miyuki at work, the idea of her booby-trapping her purse was pretty funny.  But the laughs aside, this series doesn't really have any part in the main ""You're Under Arrest"" series (the initial OAV, first TV series, movie, and 2nd TV series).
Bottom line: worth a few laughs.  People who want to own every YUA DVD will want it in their collection.  Kudos to ADV for looking out for dub fans and keeping the same dub cast as AnimEigo used.",1080345600,2,1675,4.614864864864865
