5276918,5,B0097JYLXW,"La Bartoli, once again, finds a challening and marvelous composer with which to regale us. Agostino Stefani was quite unknown to me prior to my popping this DVD into my player. And the interiors of Versailles...oh, goodness.
This is musically stunning and visually opulent...a treat for eye AND ear.",1374451200,3,299,5.122448979591836

5276922,5,B0097JYLXW,"There is nothing to compare with this DVD. Original and Interesting presentation and music. Everything about it is unique, the singers (soloists and choir), the instrumentalists, and not least the magnificent setting, colors and sound. A treasure",1361923200,6,246,5.675675675675675
5276923,5,B0097JYLXW,"Great learning experience about Agostino Stephani. He was a priest. a diplomat, as well as a composer.
His music is performed by Cecilia Bartoni and filmed in the French palace of Versailles;
Great music and great visuals.",1360540800,7,222,5.027027027027027
5276924,5,B0097JYLXW,It is a summary from her last CD. The pictures are great and it is filmed in Versailles. You can enjoy the melodies but the story is told from Agostino Steffani point of view. No inquiries taking place like in the movie to the CD Maria. A little bit more research about Agostino Steffani had made it a better film. So you see Cecilia Bartoli with her beautiful voice and the orchestra. It is a little bit disappointing. I thing the normal CD is the better match. But to every CD is a making of or a little film produced to push sales volume. Easy going music with a motion picture.,1356566400,18,581,4.243243243243243
8537446,5,B0097JYLXW,"My favorite C.B. dvd to date  Reference quality audio and video.  Just enough dramatic history of Agostono Steffani to enhance his music with a perfect variety of his compositions, all set in rooms of Versailles which lend beauty to the music, musicians, and superb vocalists.  My hope is Cecilia and the director will team up again for a similar DVD Tour-De Force!",1502582400,,365,4.854838709677419

8537448,5,B0097JYLXW,"With an interestingly written narrative and Cecilia Bartoli performing the songs in a venue like Versailles, what's not to like?",1468108800,,128,5.45
8537449,5,B0097JYLXW,"Cecilia's range is wide and full of color, especially the lower section. It's really thrilling to hear someone who knows the power of her voice to wring emotions out of whatever she may be singing.",1461628800,,197,4.6571428571428575
8537450,5,B0097JYLXW,"If you appreciate phenomenol virtuoso singing in Barouque and Renaissance-style music, this disc is wonderful.  Ms. Bartoli is unmatched in her singing technique.  I have never heard such perfect pitch, technical accuracy at amazing speed, and unbelievable breath control, all while performing incredibly difficult passages!!

Although beautifully filmed in high definition at the Palace of Versailles, it is not afternoon mood music, but you will be dazzled by the florid grace and magical ease of the musicians performing this obscure music of Agostino Steffani.  I certainly enjoyed it, although I most likely will not listen to or view it often, as it is unusual music to which I am not especially attracted.

Subtitles are offered for the text of the selections Ms. Bartoli sings, but not for the narration that precedes them, offered as a voice-over of an actor portraying Agostino Steffani, describing how he came to compose music while carrying out his life's work as a Catholic priest.

All in all, a very interesting hour of music you might enjoy as much as I.",1431216000,3,1070,5.085714285714285
8537451,5,B0097JYLXW,Breathtaking!,1414368000,,13,13.0
8537452,5,B0097JYLXW,"Ms. Bartoli  displays  an ""incredible"" virtuosic voice that leaves other sopranos wanting.  She has an ability to vocally undertake the music of Steffani and other composers of that period and with her phenomenal voice can, with ease display rapid fire tonal control with an uncanny accuracy.
What a remarkable Blu-ray disc this is!  The fact the music and its beautiful accompaniment takes place inside the palace of Versailles, as well as its courtyard renders a visual and hearing experience you have to undertake!  Beg, steal or borrow money to get this disc.  It will bring you hours and hours of visual and listening enjoyment.  ALSO get the soundtrack.  You will absolutely  be enthralled by it as I have been.
I can assure this:  when you listen to it, your mind will go back to those scenes inside the palace and its surroundings and make the experience of  listening to Stefani's  music a more enjoyable moment.",1408924800,3,921,4.870967741935484
8537453,5,B0097JYLXW,"Though I haven't watched this DVD yet, it doesn't matter.  She reigns supreme when it comes to classical vocalists.  Even if I never watch it, I'll still ""love"" it.  I've been a Cecilia Bartoli fan for decades.  She can do no wrong.",1405641600,,232,4.4523809523809526

This is a filmed version of a CD issued by Decca under the same name with the same protagonists.
Directed by Olivier Simonnet and produced by Pierre-Olivier Bardet, this elegant film begins with an actor portraying Agnosto Steffani commenting on his life and music.
Filmed in the magnificent Chateau de Versailles, the many famous rooms are beautifully photographed.
Cecilia Bartoli offers a collection of arias from various operas by Steffani, sung with her usual virtuoso style, with baroque accompaniment by I Barocchisti conducted by Diego Fasolis. Bartoli is joined by counter-tenor Philippe Jaroussky as listed above, and as bonus are two more items, a virtuoso aria ""Qui la dea cieca"" from Noibe, Regina de Tebe, and a brief instrumental introduction from Amor Vien Del Destino.
Particularly enjoyable are the slower arias sung by Bartoli to scant accompaniment such as a single lute, in which the mezzo-sopranos best vocal attributes are in full display, with exquisite soft singing to fluid legato lines that float like silvery clouds in a blue azure.
A highly interesting film, well produced with excellent visual and sound effects. Highly recommended.",1404000000,3,3286,5.532934131736527
