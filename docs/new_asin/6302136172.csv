7821933,3,6302136172,"Black Adder, one of the best britcoms ever, made four series, each a takeoff on costume dramas set in different eras of British history - the Wars of the Roses, the Elizabethan age, the Regency, and WWI.  The final 3 years are almost uniformly superb.  However, the first season, had a different writing team - Ben Curtis and star Rowan Atkinson instead of Curtis and Richard Elton - as well as a different director and cast from the subsequent shows.  As a result, it's just not up to the level of the later series.
This season pretends to tell the true story of an imaginary dynasty between the Plantagenets and Tudors.  The story starts with the battle of Bosworth Field, where Edmund Blackadder accidentally kills Richard III, subsequently becoming the younger, and by far the less respected of two princes under his father, Richard IV.  This set also includes an episode where Edmund plots to become Crown Prince by proving his older brother is illegitimate and one where Edmund is named Archbishop of Canterbury, a position which tends to be fatal under his father's rule.
Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder, a schemer who generally outsmarts himself with plans he only believes are cunning and Tony Robinson as the lowly servant Baldrick are constants throughout the series.  Tim Mcinerney (Percy) also appears in later seasons.  Brian Blessed and Elspet Gray as the King and Queen, and Robert East as the Prince of Wales appear only in BA I.
Overall, this isn't a bad show, just not nearly as good as the subsequent Black Adders.",1085097600,,1532,4.824427480916031

7821935,5,6302136172,"This is the original first series of the Black Adder which first aired in 1983.  In the first series, Rowan Atkinson as the Black Adder shows many of his Mr. Bean expressions and personalities.
In my opinion this is one  of the best comedy shows of all time.  This absolutely the best british  comedy that I have seen.
Rowan Atkinson leads the cast as Edmund  Blackadder,  Tony Robinson follows him everywhere as his trusty servant  Baldrick.  This would not be a classic Black Adder without his good friend  Percy who is played by Tim McInnerny.  Rowan Atkinson is also the writer of  this series, that may be why it is in my opinion the best of the Black  Adder shows.
This show, the first half of the first series contains the  following three 3 episodes, all of which are set in the darkest of the dark  ages in the late 1400's.
Episode 1 - The Foretelling. (Originally air  date: June 15, 1983)
This episode opens as with : ""History has known  many great liars. Copernicus, Goebbels, St Ralph the Liar [he is shown  holding a sign which reads `St Benedict the Liar'] -- but there have been  none quite so vile as the Tudor king, Henry VII. It was he who rewrote  history to portray his precessor Richard III as a deformed maniac who  killed his nephews in the Tower. But the real truth is that Richard was a  kind and thoughtful man who cherished his young wards. In particular,  Richard, Duke of York, who grew into a big, strong boy.""
If you  haven't seen Black Adder, this is the episode to start with, or if you have  seen other Black Adder episodes that this is a must see.
Episode 2 - The  Queen of Spain's Beard. (Original air date: July 6, 1983)
This episode is  set in 1492, where the King arranges a marriage between Edmund and the  Infanta of Spain.  Edmund and Baldrick come up with some interesting  methods of trying to get out of this arranged marriage.
Infanta Maria  Escalosa of Spain is played by Mariam Margoyles, and her interpreter Don  Speckingleesh is played by Jim Broadbent.
This episode is not as good as  episode 1, but it is still fantastic.
Episode 3 - The Archbishop.  (Original air date: June 29, 1983)
The King makes Edmund Archbishop of  Canterbury, a position usually vacated by unfortunate accidents.",947289600,,2240,4.531328320802005
