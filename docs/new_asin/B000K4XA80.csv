8154243,2,B000K4XA80,Date on DVD says 2006 but video clips must be from the 1980's at least.,1438300800,,71,3.8
8154244,5,B000K4XA80,"I got this DVD before I gave birth to my daughter as a gift. I wanted to wait to write a review to test it out. I love it! So does my daughter. She is 7 months now and we have found that in the evening when she is at her peek of fussiness the techniques in the film are worth their wait in gold. We have gotten into a routine were we do the massage after her bath with Organic Coconut Oil. She sleeps so sound through the night and if we miss her massage she now brings the little container of coconut oil to us and then lays down and gives us her feet to start.

The one thing you have to get past it that the film is older, the techniques are what you really want to pay attention too. But because of it this the DVD has something no others have. The view point of the babies, the interviews of the babies that were in the film later in life is such a gift to hear it from their side. I makes me very happy that we have made most of the techniques in this film part of our daily life.",1409443200,,986,3.8097560975609754

It might take a bit of getting used to, especially for new moms, but the techniques will help to connect baby and parents in a more loving and tactile way.  As well, parents will learn how to sooth baby, a much needed lesson for new and repeat parents.",1397433600,,348,4.323076923076923

She's still very young, but my son and daughter-in-law are already using techniques from this program to calm and relax her -- especially during the fussy hours between dinner and bedtime.",1394409600,,251,4.8604651162790695

It has def been a LIFE savor in our home !!! I would recommend this video to any of my friends/family !",1389398400,,269,4.0
8154248,5,B000K4XA80,"I love this video! It teaches parents step by step how to massage their baby. It is instructional and tells you exactly what to do, and shows you at the same time so you can follow along. It also tells you what the benefits are of each different part of the massage, so you can know how what you are doing will benefit your baby or child. I was intimidated to start because I am by no means a massage therapist but this video makes it incredibly easy. I love that infant massage can bring you closer with your baby and help you connect, and I especially love the instructions for the tummy massage- it can help the baby with gas or constipation- we have seen the results ourselves :-) I recommend this dvd for new parents and especially as a gift for new parents, because you are really giving them a gift that will benefit them and their baby throughout their lifetime.",1388361600,,870,4.343558282208589
8154249,5,B000K4XA80,"Cheryl is by far the BEST Massage Therapist that I have ever experienced!  She has such a nurturing way about her and you know she cares and wants to make her clients feel great as she heals those sore muscles and tension as she combines Deep Tissue with Swedish massage techniques.  Her expertise is apparent as I melt into the massage table, I wish she could teach all the LMT in the world, then I'd be guaranteed a wonderful massage no matter where I live.
