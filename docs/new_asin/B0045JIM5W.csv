4263132,5,B0045JIM5W,"This is one exceptional video and a bargain at that.  I throughly enjoyed hearing and seeing Lady GaGa as a real person dedicated to her work as an artist.  This is not a job for Ga Ga, this is her life she is giving to her public.  Having a Master of Arts in Theatre  I equate her life endeavor as the highest degree of talent possible for this person.  No woman has achieved such fame and this film attests to that fame and how it was possible for Ga Ga to go so far, so fast and for so long.  Of course she will pass in time, we all do but she has made her mark in the creative arts today and tomorrow, that is for certain. This film is a fitting tribute to her and her art.",1294272000,4,677,3.869565217391304
4263133,2,B0045JIM5W,"As a Fan of her music and being a Great Grandmother-Cool, I have to say,""I Love L.GaGA's music!! I bought this DVD hoping to get some insight into the ""Making"" of her DVD's. This was an ""over and over and over"" view of her getting in and out of cars, marching in parades, and saying the same droaning things over and over. I fell asleep in the middle of this. It was ""BOARING!!"" There is NO MUSIC on this DVD. It is all talk. There is no warning that you get nothing for this price. Take this for what it is worth. Don't do it!
Sincerely
Mrs. B.J. Lister",1291334400,19,554,4.091743119266055
4263134,5,B0045JIM5W,"This is a very good fanvideo of Lady Gaga.
I found this in a $5 bargain bin at Wal Mart and for the price this isn't a bad video!
It's a very intresting fanvideo and has plenty of Lady Gaga clips.",1290124800,11,196,3.8048780487804876
4263135,5,B0045JIM5W,"I got this dvd yesterday because Best Buy broke The Street Date, I found this dvd buried in a $5 bin, Being a huge Lady Gaga Fannacidct, Seeing her live and meeting her, i knew i had to get this dvd.

Now with this DVD your not gonna learn anything new if you didint follow her from the beginning, but it is truely a excellent documentry on her. Now there is interviews with Lady Gaga on here but it was interviews for tv stations and radio she did for other people. She did not do a interview for this dvd. This is not a offical,documentry. This is a fan dvd (easily edited with Apples iMovie).

If you want to know some legit info on Lady Gaga then buy this DVD. I enjoyed it alot and highly reccomend it to any little monster!

8416742,3,B0045JIM5W,I love Lady Gaga! This was a good show if you Like seeing her crazy clothes! It also had some really good information on how she rose to FAME! I learned alot about her that i didn't know before. It was worth what I paid for it. Wish there had been more interviews with her personally. But all you get is commentary from people you don't know and a couple of people you do. Im glad i added this to my GaGa library.,1339718400,2,413,3.9879518072289155
8416743,2,B0045JIM5W,"This is just a fan-made collection of random clips of the singer, with a lot of uninteresting points of view from people that ""know"" Gaga (the only one that was actually important was Michael Bolton). And if you are expecting journalistic value...forget it. It is so biased that it irritated me, plus it got really boring and repetitive after the first third.",1338681600,,359,4.806451612903226
8416744,1,B0045JIM5W,"What a hapless piece of trash. ""Lady Gaga: One Sequin at a Time"" provides a rudimentary once-over of Lady Gaga's childhood and the beginning of her career, all the way to (vaguely) the release of The Fame Monster. The filmmakers essentially read her entry on the Simple English Wikipedia, and merely cloaked it in an hour of out-of-context interviews, footage of Gaga walking red carpets or getting out of cars, and some random, very angry British man. Worst of all? They couldn't afford the rights to her music, so instead they opened up GarageBand and created generic electronica tracks that sound just enough like Just Dance and Poker Face to be recognizable, but just off enough to avoid paying royalties. Around when we heard ""Ma Ma Ma Mao"" was I certain that this was the worst thing to play on my TV in a while.",1304121600,4,818,4.6482758620689655
