8313692,1,B00125WAXW,"STRONGLY DISCOURAGED! -- Unfortunately this is NOT a good DVD for mom's to be!  It is a ""reality TV"" show in which mothers sit in a coffee shop and discuss the struggles of motherhood. The authors then intersperse a short video of a professional expert (such as a doctor or therapist) offering suggestions as to the proper way to handle the situation the mothers are complaining about.  The expert's suggestions are fine but often the mothers shown do not heed those suggestions and give their reasons as to why they disregarded the professional advise.  The behavior and language of the mothers shown is often NOT positive.  In one instance the group is shown talking about the preschoolers dancing inappropriately (bumping and grinding) because of what they are being allowed to view on TV!  (No mention of how wrong this is, or that young children's TV exposure should be limited & monitored by their parents, just laughing in agreement etc. by other moms in the group.)  In another ""episode"" mothers are discussing a return to sexual relations with their husband post delivery and VERY OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE is used. Something along the lines of: One minute he expects her to be ""Mother Theresa"" and the next his WHORE!  There are much better DVDs out there for moms-to-be.  Keep looking.",1406246400,,1289,4.907834101382488
