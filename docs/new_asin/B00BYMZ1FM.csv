8575633,5,B00BYMZ1FM,"FRAMED! with Glenn Ford is a unexpected film noir movie most obviously have overlooked by many including the studios that this masterpiece
of film noir suspense is not on DVD in US! I don't have this DVD so i can't comment i can only comment on the movie which i found a VHS
copy which was not good so i found on internet and watched a nice print and thought i'd like to have a DVD copy and there is NONE? for
US? Someone already gave a detailed movie comment so i'll just say I'm not a big Ford fan but a big film noir crime mystery suspense
fan and collector always looking for hidden gems and this is one. From the moment it starts right to the very end it's a non stop suspense
classic except the very ending was only fault with the movie. Ford is great as all the actors and writing and directing. Put on US DVD!",1477267200,,817,4.080745341614906

Back home Steve Price talks to his wife Beth (he married into wealth). Mike looks for work, the Assay Office has a tip. Jeff arrives for the assay report (good news) and meets Mike; Mike is hired.

Paula meets Mike in his room. Mike tells all to her (does he talk too much?). Paula makes a telephone call. Cunningham asks the banker for a loan, he is turned down. Youll be sorry. Steve tells Paula the Bank Examiners are coming, that $250,000 is in Paulas safety deposit box. Steve drives and explains the plot. A dead man will substitute for Steves body - tomorrow night. But Mike saw them. He goes upstairs to that caf then quits while hes ahead. [Too good to be true?] Mike returns the money to repay Paula. She thinks fast to explain away what Mike saw! Steve, Mike, and Paula inspect that mine to collect ore samples. On they way back they stop for a drink. Mike washes his hands, then drinks more whiskey. On the way back Paula acts! [No plan is perfect.] The car rolls down the hill, as planned. Later Mike sleeps it off and awakes at Paulas home. The newspaper tells about the auto crash. Paula tells Mike the story.

Paula says you killed him, Mike hit him and he fell and hit his head. The newspaper says it was murder, Jeff is arrested for it! That earlier threat at the bank. Mike tells Jeff what happened.

Paula leaves with escorts. Youll get a big reward for this. Mike replies.

The best fiction is based on true crimes. Sir A. Conan Doyle read about crimes for inspiration for his famous stories. We know about crimes because murders are usually solved, no matter how clever the scheme. Most murders involve people who know each other. Murders by organized crime are seldom solved by the police. [Wheres Jimmy?] The idea of a murdered substitute comes from a long-forgotten true crime in the 1930s. You can say this is similar to Double Indemnity with a changed plot. Erle Stanley Gardners The Case of the Fugitive Nurse has a similar story, but more interesting.",1435536000,,2836,4.522417153996101
