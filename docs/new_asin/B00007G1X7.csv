1808486,5,B00007G1X7,"Due to inclement weather, I found myself housebound with a two year old (not mine) and an almost four year old (mine).  With apologies to Dr. Seuss, it was too wet to go out and too cramped to stay in, but we had to make the most of it.

Fortunately, this DVD was on top of the pile, and it was an instant hit with both boys.  In no time at all they were singing along with Dora, Boots, Backpack and Map, and enjoying participating in the activities.

This DVD has four adventures, each involving Dora and her friends following a map, finding clues and overcoming obstacles.  It's a learning experience hidden in a fun cartoon, as Dora stares at you with her huge brown eyes, while talking about colors, counting, encouraging problem solving and introducing some Spanish words.  It should have something of interest for ages one to five, without ever being boring.

For adults it's a different matter after you've heard it the first five times or so, as the repetitive nature of the songs and activities slowly drills a hole in your skull, exposing every nerve ending to the strident ""I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the maaaaaap"" and ""Backpack, Backpack, Backpack, Backpack...""

Anyway, the price of a pair of earplugs and the inconvenience of having to schedule a lobotomy is a fair trade for keeping the kids from going stir crazy and fighting each other, especially when you hear them using Spanish words and watch them having fun learning.

Just go with the flow, and join in yelling ""SALTA"" while you jump over the imaginary watermelons rolling through your living room.

1808488,5,B00007G1X7,"Thank goodness they finally came out with another DVD Dora option!  My child adores this brunette adventurer.  Before this DVD, my only option was the Nick Jr. holiday compilation, YIKES!  ""Dora"" was my daughter's second word.  She has been enchanted with the show since a baby.  Now that she's almost two, the love affair is as strong as ever.  The selection of epidsodes is nicely themed, and you can expect your usual fare of learning lessons, whimsical songs, and silly smiles.  We watch the DVD and then do something fun afterwards: make a map, pretend with capes, sing songs, etc.  It's great fun.  Highest recommendation! ENJOY!",1048896000,6,635,4.915094339622642
1808489,4,B00007G1X7,"There are actually four episodes of Dora the Explorer on this DVD, but hitting ""Play All"" in the main menu only plays two of them, the other two are burried way down in sub-menus.  If you select ""Play All"" from the main menu, I wish it really would!
The four episodes on this DVD are typical of the episodes on TV, so if your kid likes those, they'll like this DVD.",1048377600,10,365,4.140845070422535
1808490,5,B00007G1X7,"My daughter loves this DVD.  I like the educational skills it gives her with counting and colors as well as language skills.  I think Dora is an excellent addition to the children's educational characters.  My favorite is she is Latina and so adorable. ""We Did It!"" :)",1047427200,2,268,4.659574468085107
1808511,5,B00007G1X7,I got this for my first granddaughter and she loved it!  She would come over and immediately ask to watch it.  She always wanted chocolate milk and fishy crackers.  She is five now and has outgrown it.  I now have three other granddaughters and two of them may yet use it.  This series is very popular and can entertain children for hours and give you a bit of a break from the stress of babysitting.  I also got the Pirate one and she loved that as well.  I recommend this series to all grandparents.,1362441600,,501,4.26595744680851

1808517,5,B00007G1X7,"First of all, I think Dora is a good female cartoon character for my daughter to look  up to. Having said that, that little girl ANNOYS THE CRAP out of me!  My daughter is completely and utterly fascinated with her immediately after watching this DVD rental from our library.  She sings the map song all day and ""we did it"" song too.  We watch it every OTHER day (for my sanity) but she would like to watch it 5 times daily if I let her.  She has learned a few spanish words while watching-rojo, amarillo, and salta (of course!).  Buy the dvd, but be forewarned--you too just might be humming the Dora theme song while driving to work too!",1227830400,,639,4.3277310924369745
