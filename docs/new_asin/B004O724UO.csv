4436833,5,B004O724UO,I really dig the edited version of Dragon Ball Z with the Kai series. Never watched any previous episodes. No Garlic Jr. Saga is fine with me.,1326844800,,142,4.296296296296297
4436834,5,B004O724UO,"I recently bought this off Amazon.com took about a month before i got it but the wait was justified by me being able to watch it. I love this cause it removes all the filler, i hear its been redrawn/animated but i don't understand why it wasn't done in 16:9 instead of 4:3 most tv's nowadays would have 16:9 screens.

The best part of this Blu-ray is when i looked this up on Bluray.com it told me it was Region A as well as Region B because i live in Australia i needed it to be region B so i was excited by this fact, because of the sale i got it for only $20, but if i bought it from Madman over here in Aus it would of set me back $61 :(

So I'm glad i bought it off Amazon.com :D",1313625600,,684,3.7762237762237763
4436835,5,B004O724UO,"DBZ Kai is great.it really made me want to watch the series again.i love how they got rid of all they pointless filler.and this isn't the version that's on Nick Toons,it's all uncut and contains plenty of blood and language(bastard,damn,etc.)it's stupid that some fans aren't giving it a chance because it's not the DBZ they grew up watching,which is true because Kai is much more fast paced and is much closer to the Manga.and also the voice actors are different from the original DBZ(except for Sean Schemmel and Christopher Sabat)but Funimation did a great job picking out voice actors because they all sound great(in my opinion)i can't wait ti'll Part 6 comes out,",1313107200,,668,4.920353982300885
4436836,5,B004O724UO,"Longtime fans of DBZ seem to have mixed feelings about Dragon Ball Z Kai. The reasons are very obvious. Kai cuts out a lot of the filler material that was in the original 291 episodes (they've now cut it down to a mere 98). Part 5 deals primarily with the last moments of Planet Namek and shortly after that the beginning of the Trunks Saga all the way into the middle of the Android Saga. Part 5 encompasses what are without a doubt some of my favorite episodes in the entire series. My only complaint is that they omit the entire Garlic Jr. Saga. I believe this was done for two reasons:
1) It was considered irrelevant filler
2) DBZ Kai does its absolute best to stick as close to the manga as possible and to my understanding the saga was not present there.

Regardless this is a minor complaint because the original series is still readily available in both the HD Remasters and the Dragon Boxes. DBZ Kai features completely reworked English dub which is immediately noticeable by fans of the original cast. This of course really comes down to opinion. I personally enjoyed the new voice cast, and some of the original cast does make a return. I also know others that I grew up watching the show with that felt the opposite. Another noticeable change is that the show features far more action with a lot less breaks in between (just as it advertises). I will say however this is NOT the version that aired on Nickelodeon per se. There's quite a bit of language as well as blood. Nothing too over the top of course but I can promise you it wasn't on Nickelodeon at 2 o'clock in the afternoon that's for sure. This is definitely one of the most 'uncut' versions I've seen. I say this because if you plan on buying this for a 5 year old you might be better off picking up the HD Remasters (the orange boxes).

As for the Blu Ray versions of Kai it goes without saying that there is a very noticeable difference in quality from its DVD counterpart. In short, it's absolutely worth the few extra bucks to pick up the Blu Ray version.",1311638400,3,2033,4.389920424403183
4436837,5,B004O724UO,"Dragon Ball Z Kai receives a nice change of pace after the very action-heavy pace of Part 4. Now we get a much welcome amount of humor with the discovery of Trunk's parentage, and a very funny scene with Chi-Chi. Akira Toriyama is very good at writing humor with his characters and glad we got a better fusion (get it?) of action and humor. A major change to the series itself is the music. Kai had its own musical score until it was removed for copyright infringement. So, they reedited the original Japanese music from Dragon Ball Z into Kai. It took some getting used to at first but on the whole, the original music fits in better in my opinion. I think the copyrighted Kai music was better at big fights than the original score, but the original is better for a more variety of scenes. I also noticed that on the broadcast, earlier episodes' music was also changed to the original. Does this mean that the discs with the copyrighted music will become rare??? Of course, the blu ray picture is the best this series can possibly look and I absolutely love the new dub. If you've been buying the Kai sets then you need to definitely buy this one too. If you can get past the new music you should really enjoy these episodes. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the some actual special features like in Part 3 would be nice. Look forward to Dragon Ball Z Kai Part 6!",1311552000,6,1362,4.366141732283465

The image quality is stunning as always, great to look at (with new footage too), the episodes are now more action packed than before because of the elimination of filler it had.

Music on Dragon Ball Kai, this is an interesting piece of the set to talk about now.

The music used on the episodes are from the Dragon Ball Z series, which is by, Shunsuke Kikuchi.

Regardless of the replacement music for the episodes, the NEP's (Next Episode Preview) and eye-catch still uses the original BGM from DBK.

At times the tracks used became a little repetitive due to the fact that only 100 DBZ BGM's were utilized for Dragon Ball Kai, however, it did not bother me and I completely loved it.

Finally, this part covers the whole Human Artificial saga, Cell's is up next (Part Six).

4436839,5,B004O724UO,"I have been a loyal fan of Dragon Ball Z since I was younger and watching the original run on Toonami and on VHS. I drifted away from DBZ for many years but have been an anime enthusiast ever since DBZ got me hooked.

Dragon Ball Z Kai caught my eye for several reasons: mainly being remastered yet retaining the original 4:3 aspect ratio (unlike the previous two versions that chopped part of the format to be presented in pseudo widescreen). I have faithfully purchased the Kai series (the titles released so far) on Blu-Ray. Here are my thoughts:

This part takes us through the Trunks and Android sagas up to the Cell saga (can't wait for Sept 15th!)

Technical stuff:
The ratio is kept to the original 4:3 aspect. Some animations have been cleaned and even re-animated (in the case of some of the lighting effects from ki attacks and power-ups). Some of the re-animated shots look like something from American Saturday morning cartoons rather than anime, but these instances were very rare. The two that stood out were in the previous volume anyway.

The sound is vastly superior to the previous versions. The English dub is improved and they aren't afraid to get a little dirty (they swear often, but not in an offensive way. They just yell 'you bastard' a lot). Though the few uses of swearing is in line with the more literal translation. Also, the American voice acting is a lot better this time through. Most of the lines have been slightly changed to stick closer to the actual translation. The Japanese voice acting is the original (highly amusing in some roles) though it has also been cleaned up a bit so that static is removed.

The music is the original Japanese score, just re-digitized for this release. It is superior (quality) to the original Japanese (analog sound) and the American scores (though the American score was pretty good considering). (Clarification: the quality is superior in this release, the Japanese music being re-digitized and cleaned up and the voice acting both in Japanese and English has been redone is many parts.  So when I say superior, I meant superior quality to the original)

Editing:
Here is where most die hard Dragon Ball Z fans choke up: There is a lot of cut content. I have seen the original, un-cut, American and Japanese versions. I gotta tell you. You're not missing anything. Most of what was cut was pure filler by TOEI trying to fill time slots. They've also removed a lot of re-used cells. I remember how annoyed I was to see Piccolo battling the Android and TOEI reusing animation cells from the Piccolo-Raditz battle. Seriously. Also, I don't hear too many people upset about missing out on the Garlic Jr saga.

They cut about 50 episodes (give or take) and reduced the amount to 98 (through the Cell Games saga). I don't know if they will continue through the Buu saga (no word yet even in Japan), but I am a huge fan on the improvement in quality of picture and sound so I hope they do.

Also of note: the Blu-Ray version is presented in full HD, though the original show was analog and standard definition. There is a noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray version in animation clarity and quality. There is also a major difference on the sound. The difference is worth the $2 or so for the Blu-Ray vs DVD if you have a player.",1309910400,12,3307,4.629692832764505

Language: Japanese and English
Blu Rays: 2
Number of Episodes: 13.
Entertainment value: Priceless.

Contains Episodes: 53-65

Basically this is the aftermath of the Freiza Saga and involves Goku returns to Earth. The appearance of Frieza and his father King Cold, and Trunks.

I would call these episodes nothing short of excellent. They add some much needed drama, the humor and enjoyment of seeing Frieza getting what he deserves.

Also worth noting the ending episodes set up the Android Saga(Episodes 59 to 63)

English dub like always is worth watching. Japanese is good too.",1309392000,3,727,5.170940170940171
4436841,5,B004O724UO,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. These 13 episodes are my favorite part of the entire Dragon Ball series. Trunks, The Androids, and lots of Super Saiyan action!

My take on Kai: Awesome. Everything I have ever wanted out of this series put into 98 episodes. A good amount of action, and it doesn't deviate from the story or have lots of filler. I give some serious props for Toei for making a great series.

Not to mention in HD! It's so much cleaner and clear when it's in HD! I tried watching it on Nicktoons (Which is only in standard in my area) and it's just not the same... I will never go back to watching standard definition for this show, or anything animated.",1305331200,17,676,4.31496062992126
