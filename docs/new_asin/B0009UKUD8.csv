8066983,5,B0009UKUD8,I purchased this for my nephew for his birthday. He loves the classic cartoons that I and his dad was brought up on. Most of the cartoons today just do not have the fun and classic style that makes them really good to watch over and over again. They are just too complicated to watch.,1214265600,3,284,4.181818181818182
