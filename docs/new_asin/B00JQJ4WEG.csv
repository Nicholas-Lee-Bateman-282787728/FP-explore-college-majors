8653312,5,B00JQJ4WEG,"The night before Christmas Eve a cyclist is run down on a wintry Italian road. This one act sees the lives of two families permanently entangled. The question of how it happened and moreover who did it are left hanging. What we get then is the slow reveal in flash back that takes us on a tour of all the events that led up to the accident and the duplicity beyond.

Dino is a middle class real estator; he sees the ostentatious opulence of his daughter's new boyfriend's family and wants in. He ingratiates himself for a lucrative deal. But the market is about to crash and relationships can end on the rocks like bad business deals. We have back ground shenanigans galore and lies being used to mask other lies as all the lives of the families start to unravel. The film is told in chapters so that we often get the same event but from a different persons view. As this proceeds, so do the veils drop from all of the deceptions and untold truths.

The direction, acting and cinematography in this film are stunning. It has effortless style and also has a hanging menace that sticks in your craw like stale perfume. It is a film of the clash between the haves and have nots, but it is all an under current for the main plot. Adapted from the English novel by Stephen Amidon and made by Paulo Virzi who has made a film at the high end of what is to be expected, it is in Italian with good subs and runs for 111 minutes and is one I really enjoyed watching",1417824000,7,1455,4.268115942028985
