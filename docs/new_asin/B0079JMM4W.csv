5065427,5,B0079JMM4W,Take me home was a movie that I only happened to find by chance -- it stars and is written/directed/produced by Parenthood star Sam Jaegar and this is just a fun ride.  They actually took a cab across country.  It's better than most romantic dramas and Sam Jaegar is just terrific.  Well written and a must see.,1339286400,2,311,4.421052631578948
5065428,3,B0079JMM4W,interesting plot that could of resulted in a deeper performance by the two leads with more interesting depth. All in all it is worth an hour and a half and as a result you will not regret it.,1338076800,3,191,4.052631578947368
5065429,4,B0079JMM4W,"I don't wan't to spoil anythng by reveling the plot, but wanted to give my thoughts about this movie.  I saw  this movie while staying at a hotel. I truly enjoyed it. The actors had great chemistry & didn't overact the scenes. The movie moves smoothly (almost slow), but keeps you locked into the story. The scenery in the movie is beautiful.  I would love to see these actors together in another movie.",1337472000,64,403,4.493150684931507
5065430,5,B0079JMM4W,I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well acted and the storyline was interesting. There was a lot of depth to the characters.,1337385600,9,130,4.458333333333333
5065431,4,B0079JMM4W,"""Just drive, that's what you said, just drive."" Thom (Jaeger) is down on his luck. He can't get a job and just got kicked out of his apartment. In order to make money he decides to pretend he's a cab driver. After a few fares Claire (Jaeger) hails him down. She is also having a bad day and tells him to drive. So he does. I have gotten in the habit of not watching previews before watching a movie so I don't have any preconceived notions going in. I watched the preview for this one and really thought it would be a little boring. This was anything but boring. This movie takes two proved formulas and puts them together. A romantic comedy mixed with a road movie. The acting was OK and the budget for this was not the best but it was a great movie that is better then a lot of the high budget movies. This movie is pretty predictable but sometimes it works and this is an example of that. I tend to like the movies with an ending that isn't always happy but every once in a while a movie like this comes along and it just has a calming feeling when it works out the way it should. Overall, a very satisfying movie that deserves to be watched. I liked it a lot. I give it a B+.",1337299200,14,1179,4.064377682403434
5065432,5,B0079JMM4W,"A really enjoyable film with several scenes that might have you laughing out loud, even if you're watching the movie by yourself!

Sam and Amber Jaeger make a convincing couple and I had to wonder if a few of the scenes weren't ad libbed a bit, since they worked so well!

A great evening's entertainment which I would recommend for anyone over 13. I know we'll be watching ""Take Me Home"" again.",1336953600,,395,4.472222222222222

5065472,4,B0079JMM4W,"This movie was pretty good, I liked it because you got to see two people who did not know each other just learn about one another, but in the end realize they were right for one another. This is a feel good, just want to zone out and not think about anything for the evening kinda movie. A bit slow in some parts and def. does not belong in the comedy section more like the independent movie section.",1520640000,,400,4.141025641025641

5065474,5,B0079JMM4W,Awesome feel good movie!!!!  Great casting by putting Sam and Amber together in this wonderful movie.  The chemistry developed throughout the movie and the story line flowed smoothly.  Sam Jaeger and Amber Jaeger need to star in more movies written and directed by Sam Jaeger.,1520035200,,276,5.088888888888889
5065495,5,B0079JMM4W,Beautifully made movie. This is what independent film making is all about.,1519430400,,74,5.25
5065496,5,B0079JMM4W,"Very different kind of movie, but made you pull for the 2  lead characters, that had great chemistry.  Did not know they were married, but it worked and if more movies are produced like this, there is a good chance Hollywood will regain respect again. Thumbs up",1519257600,,261,4.531914893617022
5065497,5,B0079JMM4W,"One of my favorite of the quirky romances I found on Amazon. When it came out on DVD, I had to order it. When the other quirky romances I found on Amazon come out on DVD/BluRay, I'll order them too.",1519171200,,198,3.975
5065498,5,B0079JMM4W,"I loved it. I'm also very impressed that Sam wrote, directed, and stared in it. He's super talented. I thought it was really sweet that the main actors are married in real life. I suggest this to anyone that likes romantic comedy movies.",1518307200,,237,4.534883720930233
5065499,5,B0079JMM4W,"""Take Me Home"" is a simple, charming, plausible story, well told.  It's not formulaic, smarmy, saccharine, or cute.  It's not rollicking, wild, or hysterical.  It's not tired, cliche-ridden, romantic rehash.  It is a fun, modestly-paced, clever, well-acted, carefully directed, clearly told, cleanly shot, elegant little comedy well worth watching.  I watched it twice, and found it consistently entertaining.",1517702400,,409,5.982758620689655
5065500,5,B0079JMM4W,"My wife and I really liked this movie. It was peaceful, earthy, human, artistic. Perfect for snuggling, and just ... enjoying.

5065518,2,B0079JMM4W,"Weird movie, whose back story of how it was made is almost more interesting that the movie plot !
Alot of unpleasantness goes on until the happy ending.
This is not a Hallmark type feel good movie, but an exploration of the navigation of 2 people struggling with life , love & family, which aren't necessarily the tidy  package we want them to be",1516320000,2,346,4.40625
5065519,4,B0079JMM4W,A heartwarming movie! Nice story. Loved the photography in it,1516060800,,61,5.2

5065521,4,B0079JMM4W,"The script was great. The actors were superb. There were no violent acts, no profanity, just great dialog with passion and honesty. This is one of the best movies in the jilted wife/loser makes good genre I've EVER seen. And I've seen a few! The O. Henry ending was long and well done, not cliche' like so many surprise endings. There is a moral message here for humans everywhere: We can do better in relationships IF WE ARE HONEST. I have never heard of these actors or directors before now, a truly refreshing and uplifting movie that my wife and I both enjoyed. Keep up the good work, thank you.",1515283200,,599,4.454545454545454

5065524,5,B0079JMM4W,"Frankly, I am really surprised that a sweet romantic comed like this has not had a better exposure than an idiotic review on Rotten Tomatoes (speaks volumes of this site).  I did not expect a masterpiece of comedy. At the same time, I hoped not to see a tacky, vulgar film.  Well, I was entirely satisfied.",1515024000,,306,4.446428571428571
5065535,4,B0079JMM4W,A very good movie. I honestly thought it would be a different kind of movie more humor but as the movie goes on it had its humor and ended up being a good friendship movie. Not to spoil it but wish the two main characters would have gotten together maybe they did maybe they didn't. I don't know. A story of two people kind of lost in their own worlds of despair and coming together on this crazy journey. So yes I liked it. Would have liked to find out what happened at the end but maybe that was the point.,1514764800,,508,4.03960396039604

5065559,5,B0079JMM4W,Very good! Started out thinking this was going to be a cheap cheesy movie but it was actually great! Two strangers come together with nothing to lose only to find happiness.,1510358400,,173,4.612903225806452
5065560,5,B0079JMM4W,"One of the best Indie films I've ever viewed.  Great road flick, and the ending is everything you want it to be!

5065564,5,B0079JMM4W,"Fabulous movie!  In no way ""low budget"" in any negative sense of the  word!  Excellent film work. Acting very, very good, Hollywood good:) with just a few small changes.

First, and most importantly, I would suggest cutting some of the ""extras""for the sake of a simpler plot.  At the end of the film via the appearance of these extras you just hammer the theme home way too many times so the cut would solve that issue.  Secondly you need to make a few small changes with Claire's character development in early scenes;  we need to like her a bit more to care what happens next, right:)

With just a few very important changes this could easily be one of best movies I've seen in a long time online. And I truly mean BIG SCREEN MATERIAL.  Lets hope for a remake, with maybe Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck!",1508284800,,805,4.421768707482993

5065579,4,B0079JMM4W,"Don't give up on this movie right away.  I liked the beginning, and then there was a point where I seriously considered giving up on it, just because of something that happened.  I stopped it that night, but took it up again tonight and am really glad I did.  The acting was superb.  I hadn't heard of these actors before, but they were great - the two main characters.  It's not fast or super sexy (there are no scenes a young teen couldn't see), but it's heartfelt and a couple scenes had me laughing out loud.  Just a nice movie.",1507593600,,532,4.27

5065584,2,B0079JMM4W,It's a very sweet film but badly acted. The female lead's acting is so canned. The entire supporting cast is C-rate actors. Only the male lead is convincing in his role. I really wish it were better but the plot is entirely predictable and script is amateurish.,1505952000,,261,4.574468085106383
5065595,5,B0079JMM4W,I love this movie!  I love the fact that it is a romance that doesn't have all the smut and garbage.  Both the main actors are great with a beautiful story line.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie.,1505692800,,193,4.162162162162162

As a person who traveled around the country both driving and hitch hiking for nearly 10 years, there is something about the random experiences you go through with the people you travel with that can forge lifelong friendships and/or love with your traveling companions. Even with those that at first seem like there may never be common ground. I appreciated the more mellow and realistic take on the love story.",1502668800,,566,4.53921568627451

I wasn't expecting a lot, but it kept my attention, especially Sam Jaeger's character and acting early on. I had never seen his wife before, but was very impressed by the end of the movie. Not a film critic, just enjoy a movie that leaves me feeling pretty good or entertained.  It doesn't have to be life-changing.",1500768000,,413,4.506666666666667

5065619,2,B0079JMM4W,"Look, I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but throughout the movie you realize that these two disagreeable characters just HATE each other, and through the magic of physical proximity throughout the movie they wind up together at the end. He's essentially a con artist with an anger problem, while she just has the anger problem and a cheating husband. I watched the entire thing hoping for it to get better, and it just never did. Every funny line is in the trailer. I love indie movies and really wanted this to be watchable, since the husband and wife team wrote it and put it together and I understand how difficult it is to write and perform anythig. Want a charming indie? Go look up 2016's ""Operator"", and see the difference between quirky and flawed, but ultimately characters in that film vs. the generic paper-thin caricatures in this movie. I hate writing bad reviews, but I wish I'd never seen it. Two stars for getting off their butts and creating anything, but I sadly cannot recommend it.",1499385600,,1014,4.670391061452514

5065622,5,B0079JMM4W,"After a little bit of a rough start, I must say, I found this movie charming, unpredictable, and kept getting better and better. It grows on you as you watch, the characters develop, and you like them, you sympathize, you see their foibles, their misguided impulses. They're so human. And likable.

The symbolism of the cab--a rented relationship--is merely the beginning as this film delivers how relationships may transform, strengthen, or end.

5065639,2,B0079JMM4W,"Thom, desperate for cash after being evicted from his apartment in New York City, is operating as an illegal taxi driver.  Claire, in an emotional crisis after catching her husband flirting with his assistant and learning that her estranged father has had a heart attack, hires him to drive her all the way to California.  The road trip leads to some humorous adventures, largely engendered by Thom's habitual lying and Claire's barely suppressed resentments.

This movie provided some interesting and light-hearted entertainment, but the ending ruined it! **Spoiler alert:  when Claire finally arrives in California, her husband is there waiting for her, full of apology for having turned to his assistant for friendship and support, but insisting that he ""never crossed that line.""  He assures Claire that he has broken off the relationship and wants to work on making their marriage better.  Yet in the end we see Claire throw it all away to pursue a relationship with Thom, who, although charming, has shown himself to be a self-serving liar and thief.  Don't get me wrong - I find Thom's character likeable in an appealing naughty-little-boy sort of way, but it's sad that once again Hollywood wants us to celebrate a woman ditching a man who is willing to put out the effort to build a good relationship in favor of the illusory 'freedom of the open road.'",1497398400,,1362,4.947368421052632

5065665,5,B0079JMM4W,"For me this movie was about the evolution of trust...  in the beginning there wasn't a lot of trust within each character.  The cabby wasn't being honest about his credentials, name, profession, etc...  he didn't trust people to accept him for him.  The cheating husband wasn't honest with the wife or with himself.  The wife didn't feel safe enough to be open about why she is traveling to CA... again a lack of trust.  As the movie progresses, each character begins to deal with their issues with trust at some level... some more successfully than others.  The wife of the cheater realizes that the cabby is not telling the whole truth, and yet must learn to trust him if they are to make it to CA.  The cabby comes to terms with his deceiving ways and in an amazing show of humility and respect, apologizes to her.  The cheating husband breaks off the affair, but fails to come to terms with the real issues in the relationship.  His journey with trust never quite gets him to where he really needs to go.

Being a part-time Uber driver, it intrigued me (though I've never come close to this scenario). Very impressed with the character and story development, cinematography and sound track ... and the acting was very believable with an authentic development of the relationship between cabbie and cabbor (I know it's not a word, but you get it). As an Uber driver, someone getting in your car and saying, ""just drive"" probably isn't your best way to start a 'trip', especially if she YELLS at you to begin the ride. But in a movie, the suspension of disbelief works because you're anticipating something enjoyable to follow. This film does not disappoint.",1496016000,2,807,4.9411764705882355

Although the two main actors did not have a lot to work with in this script, neither of them captured my imagination, affection, respect, or even interest.  I stuck with it to the bitter end thinking that it would get better or that somehow these two characters would come alive.  The woman Claire is self-absorbed, selfish, cold, and a very good definition of ""a bitch"".  She shows no warmth, feeling, concern (much less love) for anybody throughout the movie. Except for a couple of long stares near the end, she shows no feeling or attachment to the man (Thom).  He is at least a bit likable, although its frustrating to see him stumble from one self imposed disaster to another.  He is patient, far more than I can imagine any man being with such a selfish, bratty woman.  Clearly, he needs approval, respect, and love in his lonely, failing life.  Hard to imagine that he thinks he can get it from this woman.  Therefore, the ending is simply ridiculous.  The movie did not at all develop a blossoming relationship between the two based on anything other that their mutual need to get out of the several messes they get themselves into. Don't waste your time.  It is not the impulsive adventure, with excitement and some fun, that pulls these two together romantically as we are led to believe by the storyline description. The dour, whiney music score adds to the drag that this movie becomes from the very beginning and sustains for 90 minutes. simply a total waste of time.",1489881600,5,1520,4.613382899628252

It comes off to me as though the writer took the prototype rom-com elements and road trip mishaps they liked in other films and combined them into a 'best of' setting. The dialogue was flat and uninspired, they used a few 'trick shots' with the camera to set up a shot that never carries through. It starts off with the introduction to the main characters but never fully finishes that part before awkwardly putting them together.

5065821,5,B0079JMM4W,"Loved this film! It went from zero to 40 with the first 10 minutes, then hits about 65-70 MPH for most of the movie. It's a road trip with a lot of differences.  This is a far more realistic husband and wife (real life) film than most others we can see with actors sharing parts of their first names. It is alternately sad, confusing, funny, chaotic, thoughtful, with a few repeats, and definitely intriguing as we are along for the ride.

What I liked best is how the film unwinds with stops along the NYC to San Diego journey at about the same speed as information is revealed about Dan and Claire. They are less able to reveal the truths about themselves than most strangers on a bus between San Antonio and Austin. Yet, as they do, there are surprises, sweet and bittersweet.

I am so used to Superheroes (primarily Marvel), Star Trek, or Star Wars dragging me into the action at light speed (give or take a warp) that begins quickly and does not quit until after the credits when someone looks out at the audience and tells us to go home.

This film is not what usually happens, yet if your stay with it until she orders the cabbie to ""JUST DRIVE!!"" and he does so, everything begins to have a steadier beat - or not - yet it is really interesting. This film seven audience awards as film festivals from Boston across the country to the Napa Valley.

It you are an adult who would like time-out from time in the 23rd Century, or a galaxy far far away, or having to listen to Thor bragging about how much better he is than Cap, this would be a great alternative.",1486339200,10,1566,4.3310580204778155

She also finds out her dad, with whom she's had very little contact over the years, is dying.  She leaves NY in a cab to go see her dad in CA without telling her husband.  Understandably she's distraught.  She and said cab, who has a big suitcase of his own issues he's lugging along, begin to get used to one another.  In the end, they reach CA in time to attend her father's funeral, where her husband is waiting on her.  He confesses that he had been discussion their relationship issues with his coworker and had too many personal conversations but that it never went beyond too-personal conversations.  He admits it shouldn't have happened and that he was breaking things off with said coworker, and that he was willing to do whatever it took to work on their marriage.  In the end, she moves out and eventually tracks down cab driver to presumably start a relationship with him.  I am opposed to the message here that when you don't feel love toward someone it's then okay to walk away from a marriage.  Or that a marriage is not worth working diligently to preserve (not including situations of abuse or affairs).

Ultimately it disappoints by trying to have it both ways, and in the end neither of the characters, so appealing through most of the film, are all that attractive... but then, are any of us? So again, is this actually a good movie? If only I knew what the writer/director intended... whether he knew what he doing or whether this incongruity is an accident. I am not normally put off by ambiguity, but I guess I wanted either an indie film that along its quirky path exposed the hazards in our efforts to relate to another person thanks to our imperfections, or a traditional rom com that won out by being the cream that rises above the limitations of the genre as the good ones do.

Thom and Claire meet under poor circumstances and take a cross country road trip. Of course they fall in deep care, not going to say love. At the end of the trip they want more desperately but are seperated by circumstance. I will give credit to the lead actress (actors I think are married in real life) she had a bone dry delivery that wasn't humor free but was unusual enough to establish a unique character.  I was a little put off by the ending, not spoiling it but it could be considered a gold digger type ending and frustrating because just a small tweak could have fixed that... but, not enough to ruin the movie for me.",1473724800,,777,4.315068493150685

But, at the date of this ""customer review,"" this film has 2,819 ""customer reviews"" - WOW.  And an overall ""four star"" rating - WOW.

And thank you, ""customer review"" people, for your approvals - which I usually read - which persuaded me to obtain this film, which I probably would have otherwise missed.

Genuine, fresh, natural and authentic - attributes of this film, which once again demonstrates the hidden treasures one may discover in viewing ""independent"" films.

I'd seen this film before & wanted to watch just the opening again last night before going to bed. I ended up watching the whole thing a second time around - staying up way later than I had planned. What an enjoyable movie! Solid script writing & fine acting. Good old fashions  story telling with some modern twists. A love story that doesn't overdo it, doesn't beat you over the head about love. It just lays that part of the story out for you to enjoy & even laugh a little.",1469059200,9,642,4.17741935483871

5067157,3,B0079JMM4W,"I gave it a three stars. Unlike the most Hollywood movies, this is a refreshing way of working the tension into the couple on the road. I enjoyed the romance and the chemistry between the two. The theme of seeking for true love and the difficulties one may encounter on the way, is reflective and well staged. However, just like any Hollywood movies, it falls into the cliche of climaxing at the oversimplified version of happily together forever. Transcendental romance is the only thing being played again and again nowadays. And it's important to see the value of it being not constantly exaggerated.",1468886400,,603,4.864077669902913

As the movie played on, I found myself caught up in the story.  Eventually, I also realized the acting was really good.  When I can watch a movie without being distracted by the acting, I consider the actors to be very good.  Nothing was overacted.  The characters were completely believable.  In the end, the story was also pretty emotional and well-written.  How cute to discover that the main actors are real-life husband and wife!  I hope they find the time and money to create some more works of this kind.  Apparently, it doesn't take a huge budget and big name actors to make a completely engrossing movie.

5067823,4,B0079JMM4W,"I enjoyed the movie while I watched it, and I enjoyed the ending immensely, but I was left afterward feeling that the jump between the characters' relationship at the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie didn't develop smoothly enough.  In other words, I didn't see a logical progression throughout the movie from indifferent (or at times, in a classicly New York way, antagonistic) to liking each other to potentially loving each other.  The scenes that were designed to be critical points where the character's feelings ""came around"" or deepened didn't adequately convey that.  The acting is fine, and the writing is okay, but I think it was the writing that really held the movie back.  Just a little more refinement at a few critical points in the movie could've made this a rom-com classic - and for that, it gets four stars and is worth a watch if you're scrolling for something you haven't seen before and nothing jumps out at you.",1463788800,,948,4.692771084337349

She seemed too""bitchy"", don't know if I can use that word here but that best describes the character,  Thom played by Sam Jaeger,  is that guy you just want to pull for because it seems his world would be a nice place if he just had a chance.  Woman of ice Claire, learns to trust and love again after realizing her perfect world was not perfect and neither are human beings.  The scene where they arrive at the home of Thom's, parents, Lynette and Arnold, is one of the best in the film and a lot of  great acting takes place right there.  Michelle Krusiec as Suzanne is that cute innocent likable girl who is funny as she shares her romance stories of the latest guy with her boss.

I'm not sure if I was judging it based on the cover or the title or what, who knows, but I'm glad I finally watched it. This movie is beautifully written, acted, and directed! From the obvious chemistry between the two leads to the down to earth dialogue, this movie was fantastic. I don't want to spoil anything, but don't judge this movie based on the cover like I did. I just finished it and it's my new favorite romance. It's refreshing to watch a movie that's well made, where the characters aren't bringing each other down, and the scenery is stunning. This movie made me want to drive cross country! Love, love, love it! If you enjoy a good romance, or even just a good movie, then sit down and watch this one!",1459296000,8,860,4.415094339622642

5068160,4,B0079JMM4W,"This movie looked predictable, and maybe a tad bit boring.  That I gave it a try in the first place can be blamed on having too much time on my hands, and nothing to lose as it is free to stream for Prime members.  But this one stepped beyond the usual boundaries of the ""road trip film"" formula, without ever quite breaking through the realism barrier -- a fine line to walk.  It had some truly laugh-out-loud moments for me, and some beautiful settings, but the real redeeming qualities all lay with the acting.  Each character was so well done, that this alone breathed life into what would otherwise have been a mediocre script.  I found the ending to be a little bit less conclusive than I would have liked, but the pacing was decent, and it did have an over-all feeling of completion, and the scenes mostly flowed well together.  Not a show stopper, but better than 50% of what they regularly show in theaters, so if you are looking for something sweet and sentimental, you may enjoy this.",1458604800,17,995,4.5

5068418,5,B0079JMM4W,"Another movie, like Curly Sue, I had never heard of and well in love with. If you're a romantic like I am how could you not like this? Not predictable that these two, serendipity, meet and have their ups and downs as they travel to California. I truly loved it. I think any age group would if they love romance.",1456876800,,311,4.2
5068419,5,B0079JMM4W,This is a grand movie. I recommend it with a giant bowl of popcorn. Keeps you interested in what's going to happen next.,1456790400,,120,4.260869565217392

5068423,5,B0079JMM4W,"I don't write reviews that often, but I simply had to write something about this film. I stumbled onto it looking for something heartwarming, funny, a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. Initially, I figured it was just gonna be exactly what I thought, but it snuck up on me, and before I realized it, the end was near and I was totally engrossed! I'm not really familiar with either of the actors or their work, so I was quite pleasantly surprised at the great job the actors did. What really got to me was the simple reality of both of the characters and their lives. I could see myself in the woman. I could also see my daughter in her. This wonderfully eclectic piece of work really caught me off guard. I was hooked from the moment that Claire told Dan/Thom to ""just drive!"" It was a double surprise to find out the two main characters are married in real life! They played their parts so beautifully! And the chemistry! How it built up gradually from the initial annoyances was just darling! Pretty much no foul language, no sex scenes, no violence... what's a girl to think? That there ARE good movies out there without all that stuff! Who knew?  I also loved the soundtrack and the scenery... fit perfectly! This film may not be for everyone, but it was definitely for me! Loved it!",1456704000,,1287,4.523605150214593

5068426,3,B0079JMM4W,"Came across like a film student's class project; low budget, story we've all seen a thousand times, guy/girl meet via a road trip, initially hate each other, etc., that said, I enjoyed it.  This baseline story format keeps getting reused because the formula works when done with some competence which was here.  I watched this in the middle of the night and free with Amazon Prime and it hit the spot.  I cared about the two principle characters.  Light and breezy.  Not a great movie, but in the right set of circumstances, it plays just fine.",1456617600,,544,4.625

5068443,3,B0079JMM4W,The movie is ready to watch and entertaining but not particularly good. The story of jumping in a taxi to drive across country is fine but to lose your wallet and not get any replacement money just makes it a bit over the top.,1456617600,,226,4.159090909090909

5068537,3,B0079JMM4W,"This was a flat, unimaginative movie. All throughout, that was all the lady did, was to throw temper tantrums whenever something didn't go her way. And she never talked about any of her problems - she just physically threw things. That basically was her whole personality, and the focus of the whole movie; watching an adult spoiled brat.

And the guy that drove her cross country just put up with anything she dished out, which was too unreal too. Nobody in their right mind would put up with that.

In a way, I even felt that the movie is an insult to women, and men too. The only thing the lady has going for her is that she's very pretty. Therefore, she can act however she wants, and the guy puts up with anything she dishes out?

And, then she goes off from her corporate world to... live with him? I don't think so.

I would like to give this movie a better rating than 3 stars, but watching her throw things every time something went wrong (which were her own faults) wasn't very captivating. I kept watching it, thinking that surely something else would happen, but the only thing that changed was perhaps the objects that she threw or punched or broke, or whatever.

There are better movies to choose from.",1455667200,,1216,4.45945945945946

Amber Jaeger is sharp and acerbic, her eyes darting this way and that as if nobody is ever going to pull a fast one on her, especially not her husband.  So when she grows a bit disenchanted, imagine her running into a goofy doofus of a cabdriver who seems to be a nice guy that's broke and wanting to take advantage of her despair (and her money).  But things take a turn and they find that before long, the tables have turned.  Not one to give up, either of them, the heels dig in and soon you're on one rowdy ride across the country...in a cab!  It's a fun trip, and the brother-sister team seem to have fun portraying this couple (discovered at the end, or so it seems with their same last names), their fights almost exactly what you would picture and far from the Hollywood norm.

Much of the impact was enhanced by the three songs in the soundtrack by the group ""Bootstrap"". They are a force to be reckoned with, I predict. Their music is Transcendent and a beautiful fit for this otherwise simple and engaging movie. Call me a hopeless romantic but I enthusiastically recommend this movie.

So I skipped to the end as I was intially bored. However watching the end made me curious and I wanted to give the movie a proper chance. It seemed evident that this movie was more than meets the eye. And it is. It is a drama for sure however with strong performances from the lead actor and actresses. It was character and image driven more than dialogue. By image i mean there are some beautiful imagery/videography scenes that capture the emotions of the characters and the scenes of classic open fields. I appreciated that there was no cursing, college (ie unimaginative) humor, and not even a kiss. The movie is about the changes that occur within both Claire and Thom. Also gave a side lesson on the consequences of habitually lying and the power of understanding/forgiving/trusting. Finally, the soundtrack fits the movie very nicely and in fact, I'm keen on buying a couple of the tracks.  A very good movie that impressed me.",1454198400,,1134,4.586206896551724

Being a retired trucker, I can relate to the travel across country and did recognize a few shots in the movie especially the outlet mall in Ohio. I also related in her needing to get to Encinitas to see her dad in the hospital. Encinitas was my home town for 28 years. He being a Cabbie out of NYC and me growing up across the river in New Jersey, I enjoyed the familiarity of it all.

The woman has emotions that are not believable.

*Spoiler alert*
She verbally abuses the driver for no other reason than to ""surprise"" us with her change of heart at the end. She went home with her husband who almost cheated on her. Didn't feel much for the taxi driver until she received his post card. It seem she changed her heart is because she's learned that he became a successful artist living in a house on a cliff overlooking the ocean.

The driver is kinda lovable, but I can't buy his emotional baggage. The pieces do not fit.",1453161600,,642,4.423728813559322

What a wonderful movie!  I love that it was a family affair in the making as several Jaegers are identified in the credits.  I loved the storyline, the acting, and the way it made me feel.

I love their banter. how they act almost like married people (but they are married in real life which is likely why we feel the electricity coming out of the screen from them). They do some hilarious things, unexpected, ingenious, clever and downright belly achin' funny. The Jaeger couple created a wonderfully entertaining movie for us. We especially appreciate that there is NO sex and yet it is a great movie. Thank you Jaegers for keeping it clean. The opening statement from the lowlife dude is the only scummy type reference but it was over quick and forgetful.

Although this movie is earnest and sincere, and worthy of your viewing consideration, it is a bit formulaic and predictable. The basic plot is this [no spoilers]: a NYC businesswoman surprises her husband in an apparently compromising situation with another woman, so she hails a Yellow Cab and decides--more or less on a whim--to have the cabbie  drive her to California to see her father who is recovering from a heart attack. Along the way the cabbie and his passenger confront their lives, learn about each other, and reveal their shortcomings. This 90-minute low-budget movie's ambition exceeds its grasp. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars if I could--somewhere between ""Okay"" and ""Like"".",1451260800,,757,5.104838709677419

The story is heartwarming (even though predictable), the performance understated but authentic, and the music is amazing. I cannot say enough good things about it. I watched it on a whim because it's a Prime movie (I would not have watched it if I had to rent it because the summary just didn't seem very interesting), but was so pleasantly surprised at how perfect it is.

5069161,5,B0079JMM4W,"Honestly, a great movie. Most of the reviewers that rated it one star didn't give it a chance. They just gave up between the five and ten minute mark, and you can't really judge a movie you watched for five minutes. It's not really a fast paced movie with tons of jokes and what passes for witty dialog. It's smart, and the plot really draws you in. It's beautifully shot, and even though the premise was a bit absurd it worked somehow. It isn't overly pretentious and esoteric; it's straightforward. It's much more worthwhile than half the s***ty movies I'm usually stuck watching, due to a sad lack of wifi and the fact that I had the DVD laying around for ten years, some of which even being stoned out of your mind can't help (looking at you, American Pie Beta House).",1450742400,,772,4.443661971830986

The male lead was good but he did not appear to be an appropriate match for the conflicts they faced together.  While the movie is enjoyable, I did not find it to be particularly romantic nor funny.

The film has no sex scenes or nudity. Most of all, the film is funny without being silly or utterly unbelievable.

5069400,1,B0079JMM4W,"I really hesitated watching a movie made by Africaaners (white South Africans). As I feared, the racism of a post apartheid society is so ingrained in Africaaners still. It exposes the prejudices of a people that still want their experiences to be deemed as more valid this side of apartheid. The colonialist condescension is too much to stomach, not to mention laughably silly for its desperate grasping to inflate their collective racist egos. 2 early scenes in particular demonstrate this. 1st scene: when the white family had adopted a black African child and the family remarks that he takes it so seriously as if it was an additional and special honor to be adopted by a white family. 2nd scene: where the black African gas attendant clutches his heart melodramatically for the protagonists... as if the banal dramas of countless customers elicits such response on any self respecting customer service professional. Condescending racist trope much? I'm sure more such gems will follow.

It's not a ""chick flick,"" but it's def a romance with added benefit of the main couple being married in real life and adding to the sincerity of the storyline.  The cinematic transitions are natural and beautiful at the same time and yes, not overacted as someone else wrote.  Love that it's kind of realistic in its human relationships...not everything is cut and dry, and yes, we lie and yes, marriages get unhappy.  SPOIILER ALERT ... Didn't give it that last star because I didn't like the underlying message at the end that you chase love and not your marriage, but even that was minimal because of the loyalty to her husband when she was married (watch carefully when the ring comes off).",1444694400,,758,4.684210526315789

I was surprised that IMDB has it listed as a low budget indy film.  It seems so polished.  The plot is typical road film about two people who come together each having undergone personal stressful circumstances.  Traveling from New York to California in a taxi cab seems to stretch credibility but the dialog makes it almost believable.  I didn't learn they were husband and wife playing the lead with Jaeger children (theirs?) in the cast until after I watched the movie.

Sam Jaeger, who plays the fake NYC taxi driver seems to have one acting style, not unlike his character in Parenthoodsullen, hipster, good-guy. His real life wife, Amber Jaeger, plays the attractive NYC executive who doesn't like flying I suppose.

I can't say that the move hit it out of the park, nor can I say it was a strikeout. It wasn't bad, but it was so predictable. There were a lot of good actors playing small roles like Amber's mother and Sam's mother and father. So, I was never bored.

This is her journey, physically and emotionally, back to the things in life that matter most. Thom escorts her on this road trip of discovery and along the way we see how much he has truly hidden from himself and his own family.  The story reveals their failures without dwelling on them or making one's life struggles greater than another's. The humor is well placed throughout. I really admire that the language chosen throughout was clean. I don't remember a curse word. There were adult themes but no bedroom or overt displays of affection. Kudos!

I kept waiting for it to be funny, it never ever was... just a sad story about a New Yorker who is tired of her husband and the fast paced life, she thinks he is cheating on her, but he never crossed the line, she ends up in this fake taxicab going to California to visit her estranged and dying father, and doesn't cross the line on cheating on her husband yet, but in the end she leaves him for the cab driver...

The plot is decent and witty without being too predictable or in your face.  I was quite surprised it got so many high marks in the reviews on Amazon -- which kept me thinking (up until the end) there must be something more worth waiting for.

Nope.

So if your watchlist is getting empty and you're needing something fairly light with a bit of humor and wit, this may be for you.  However, if you're looking for something romantic to watch with the spouse (and don't intend to put them to sleep) I'd suggest you keep shopping.

Worth noting that the leading actors are married in real life - and have great chemistry on-screen (which shouldn't surprise) -- but I did find myself wondering why the actress hasn't landed more roles.  They both had a familiarity about them, reminding us of somebody, but couldn't peg it the whole movie.",1434931200,,988,4.51685393258427

5069844,4,B0079JMM4W,"A very good movie, even better if you get to watch it for Free on Amazon Prime.  Another reviewer said that these two have great chemistry ... turns out they are married in real life.  They made a great movie together.  He is a down-on-his-luck cab driver, although he's really not a cab driver ... he just pretends to be in his cab bought at auction.  It helps him make fast cash in the big city of NY and he needs cash as he's just been evicted from his rental apartment and his career can't get off the ground.  She's having an early mid-life crisis and offers to pay him $5000 to take her to California where her father is seriously ill.  A father she hasn't seen in maybe 20 years.  The trip gets complicated and these two don't know if they hate each other, trust each other, or can finish the trip together.  It's not one smooth ride from the east coast to the west coast but in 5 days they may get to know each other a little more but they still don't know if they hate each other, trust each other, or can even finish the trip together.  They each learn something about themselves.  He learns about himself.  She learns about herself.  In the meantime, we get to see her get prettier in each frame and we get to see beautiful American scenery as they make stops along the way.

To find out his wife was the leading lady in the movie -- it made this more enjoyable and maybe a watch-again movie. This movie was interesting from the standpoint of the relationships each of the main characters had with others, then with each other. Both came from expectations upon them and hurts that resulted in them not feeling good enough. Watching them spew anger at each other about things in their lives that had built up great emotions is so much the way people do take out hurts on those who haven't even caused them. The end wasn't predictable, and yet it was. They had shared a lot of pain, got honest with their feelings with each other, and then bonded without even realizing it.",1433721600,,832,4.553333333333334

5069860,4,B0079JMM4W,"Surprisingly fresh and well done.  The story involves a woman (Claire) running from a marriage in which she discovers her husband is possibly having an affair and a man (Thom) who is completely down and out who happens to own a former taxicab.  She mistakes him for a real cabbie and he is willing to drive her wherever she wants to go for a fare -- which happens to be to California to see her ailing and estranged father.  The story is a road trip and the evolving relationship between the two propels the story along.  We gradually learn about their respective pasts just as they learn about each other.

The theme of the movie is truth-telling.  The central line in the movie is Thom's, after he makes a full confession to Claire of all his errors, omissions, and lies.  He says, ""And I will never lie to you again.""  To which she replies, ""I know.""  And that is the hinge-point of the story.

This movie is rated PG-13, I suppose for some foul language.  There isn't anything objectionable in this movie other than that.  No sex scenes, even implied.  The developing relationship between the two is completely platonic.  If I have any objection to the movie it is that (spoiler alert) after attempting to rebuild her marriage with her husband, it doesn't work out for Claire and she seeks out Thom in the final scene.  But this is a nice, fun ride (pun intended).  Husband and wife actors Sam and Amber Jagger are very good together.  Their chemistry and witty repartee are a lot of fun.

5069879,4,B0079JMM4W,"I like escape movies so this is one of my personal genres.  These are two people running away and lost. Claire is running away from a cheating husband and Thom is running away from a career failure.  What a scenario that they get into Thom's illegal taxi together?  Conveniently, Claire's father has just died suddenly of a heart attack in California and so she has to get to California across the country. Driving across the country is a theme, no a recipe, for finding your lost way.  There have been many similar journeys in movies and in literature.  I like reading about them and comparing them.  In this case, it was two lost travelers trying to find their way together, somewhat romantic.  I have often been in similar situations and lost my way in the morass and had to find my way out. I relate and enjoy this type of story.  If you do too, I recommend you watch this movie!",1432944000,,883,4.440993788819876

Maybe because it didn't come out of the a typical Hollywood mill? Probably.

With interesting, realistic characters, a fun and quirky plot with twist that keep your brain alive, Sam Jaeger  did an amazing job at writing the screenplay.

I love the fact that he didn't have to rely on what most screenplays would rely on. Sex, animals, a ridiculous amount of profanity, or unrealistic antics to keep the laughs going.

The fact that he relied on the quirks of the real human condition, which is way more funny then what most people could write, definitely made this movie on the top 5 all-time awesomeness!",1431907200,,725,4.6328125

The movie's plot fails in describing his motive for accepting such an arrangement (""just drive me anywhere!"").

Weakest part:  Her acting.  She seems to try, unconvincingly, to look distraught at the beginning of the movie.

Still, it was worth watching, especially in that this movie didn't rely on shock value (sex, foul language) to keep audience interest.  Yes, it laid bare the weaknesses of the plot.  But I'd rather have that than a weak plot, weak acting and raunch just for flavor.",1431648000,,697,4.80672268907563

I was looking to spend a quality evening with my wife, laughing and connecting with each other. Thankfully we were able to accomplish that by making fun of this film. The plot was horrendously boring, and the acting was atrocious -- the movie didn't ruin our evening though.

The male lead was pretty good, but the female (his wife in real life) was awful. She seemed to have only 3 facial expressions or emotions, and her character wasn't terribly likable. The plot didn't really hang together and seemed pretty contrived at times. All in all, it was OK. I didn't turn it off, but was ready to see it end about half way through. Some movies wrap you up in other's lives and experiences, and this wasn't one of them. The soundtrack was great, however.",1418515200,2,608,4.4375

Both women and men will enjoy this delightful romantic movie, especially since it lacks the soppiness that might turn some guys off. Hope you have the chance to see it. Enjoy!",1408060800,,394,4.72463768115942
5070035,5,B0079JMM4W,"Sam Jaeger writes, directs and stars in this romantic and believable situation comedy. This is neither overblown nor timid while costarring his own wife in the opposite lead role.  Scenery mixes with a definite palpable chemistry as these two take to the road for a trip that does not start with the happiest of farewells.

Thom (Sam Jaeger) is struggling to pay his rent. He's falling behind so he has to make money quickly.  He decides to drive a cab while living in New York City, although without proper licensing to drive it and carrying many of his possessions in his back seat.  Not having another choice, he picks up a hopeful but desperate fare in Claire.

Claire (Amber Jaeger), who is a high-powered businesswoman, catches her husband at their home in an obviously questionable situation with another woman. This woman compliments her on the ""color of her bedroom"" before leaving their home.  Within the same time frame, she receives a call to let her know that her father has had a heart attack and is hospitalized. These things happen just at the same time it all hits the fan with her marriage.  This causes her to run out into the street and randomly grab a cab that just so happens to be Thom.  In a ""Shut up and just drive"" situation, it is a go and Go Now!  The eventual destination is Encinitas, CA, but as far as Claire is concerned, anywhere would be better than where she is at the moment.

This is an easier, sometimes sarcastic, mix of a story, being more subtle than in your face as it gains momentum.  The action is slower paced and the humor comes at you at the same speed though there are some definite laughs catching one right out loud.  The couple goes from one mishap to another in some gorgeous and well shown scenery (Jesse Feldman), from the Big City to Middle America, and onward.  This is all scored with some original and snappy music by 'Bootstraps' all coming together very well for an enjoyable movie that I would absolutely watch again.",1401667200,28,1978,4.569405099150142
5070036,5,B0079JMM4W,The movie was funny and smart. The plot was original - maybe not an epic but it was inspired and different than the cookie cutter romantic comedies that are being spat out onto the screen these days. It was a refreshing watch.,1401321600,,226,4.404761904761905
5070037,5,B0079JMM4W,"Quick Overview: Claire receives the news her father has a heart attack and, hysterical, she hails a cab and tells the driver, ""Drive."" Thom, perhaps confused and maybe intrigued, complies. To his surprise, he winds up driving all the way from New York to California. On the long road trip they build a fast friendship and then some.

""Take Me Home"" is a clean and innocent romantic comedy. I only noticed a couple stray curses. Other than that it is pretty family friendly.

Amber Jaeger plays Claire, who is charged emotionally and somewhat stubborn. Thom, who is played by her real-life husband, Same Jaeger, seems like he is still trying to figure a few things out. He may have had a hard go at life too. Both are fun to watch and easy to like. Their banter is laughable and their connection, while not really passionate, is still obvious.",1400371200,,842,4.644295302013423

Well done; well acted.  Definite chemistry between the leads, Sam and Amber Jaeger, who are real-life husband and wife.  Sam wrote and directed, and the 'brats' cameo (mother and misbehaved children in a taxi) are Sam's sister-in-law, nephews, and niece.  The very end is formulaic and unimaginative, but that is forgiven with the strength of the film otherwise and how endearing the characters are, and how happy you are that they *spoiler* get together.",1393027200,,619,4.970873786407767

I am somewhat biased because a photo of mine was used in the production. Having said that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Some of it reminds me of the film ""It happened One Night"" a unplanned road trip that leads to self discovery, while the two main characters are in life crisis.

Well written and acted on a low budget film made with love and feeling, by all. Realistic slice of life that moves at a slow pace, but that's how we get to know them .

The buildup of the relationship between these two was believable and I love how they handled themselves like adults would. I was bothered by one small scene in the beginning but the main character addresses it and apologizes for it later so I appreciated that. The leads have great chemistry which is probably partially due to them being married in real life, but (let's be honesty) at the same time we've all seen married couples have poor chemistry on screen too and so I think we can safely say their excellent acting played a big role too. I like road trip films/books/tropes and this one wasn't as predictable as I thought it was going to be. Sure there are a few expected tropes, but they were well done. This one was good enough for me to buy it to keep. It's one I can see lounging around and putting on during a lazy weekend. Highly recommended.",1372809600,,1013,4.481081081081081

5070061,5,B0079JMM4W,"What a great movie and a surprise to find it...easy, honest, and original.  The music is also enjoyable and really complimented the movie.

Though this movie is listed as a 'Romantic Comedy', it's not over the top Hollywood romance or comedy.  It's a solid story about two individuals who have struggles personally and professionally.  Through their trip together they become aware of these life faults and somehow each manages to overcome.  The story is mixed with subtle humor, chemistry, great supporting quirky characters, great acting by the lead roles wrapped with original music from a band who formed together for this movie.

Finally, the ending is one of the best I've seen in a long time since two strangers become friends and now the imagination leads to their new romance which may start 'guilt free'.

Hope Sam and Amber Jaeger do another movie together and great to find out that they are married husband and wife in real life.  When I saw the credits at the end of the movie, I was surprised to see the last names to be the same and also other characters with same last name.  I would guess more relationships/friends who supported this low budget and very entertaining movie.

I don't normally endorse but the movie, music, low budget, and story behind it all really captured me.  I hope you will share with others and Enjoy!",1370044800,,1342,4.766233766233766

As I watched this movie, it became very apparent to me that it was truly a labor of love by those most involved in making it -- producers, writer, director, actors,etc. It also is a beautifully filmed movie that reminded me that we are blessed to live in a magnificent and diverse country. I will recommend this movie to friends and continue to look for other independent film projects involving the Jaegers in the future.",1351900800,74,590,4.6826923076923075
5070084,4,B0079JMM4W,"I didn't like the movie at first...it seemed aimed at a  20-something audience.  The soundtrack underlined that impression.  Another road trip, I thought, with two characters with warring personalities  who will encounter troubles and eventually fall in love.  A tried and true formula.

But somehow I stuck with it, probably because the actors were very good.  I really liked the angry young woman and then the shluppy cab driver warmed up to me.  There were some good stops along the way.  The guy's family in Boulder was perfect. I loved his uptight dad and his mom who kept saying ""How Fun!""  Then, the girl's sweet eccentric mom in Las Vegas....a heartwarmer.  The scene at the memorial service was a little maudlin for me and the only scene that didn't ring true. The end was trite, too, but somehow, by that time I had forgiven them all.

After I saw the film I learned that the lead actor, Sam Jaeger,also wrote and directed the film and his leading woman is his real-life wife, Amber.  It makes sense, as they had such perfect chemistry and the whole film had that warmth about it that comes from a labor of love. I'd like to seem them together again, maybe in something with a little more depth.

PS.  A week later.  I just saw another ""romantic road trip"" film that I think is worthy of comparison to this one.  It's a French film, ""As the Sea Rises"" and in my opinion, is a much better film...much less formulaic and predictable...It has characters who don't look like movie stars and their lives are much more interesting and realistic.  I recommend it.",1351123200,23,1566,4.61231884057971

Considering the amount of positive feedback, I suspect that there are many fans of small budget indie films who will enjoy this movie.

I kept thinking it was a great story but it could have really been better directed.  The premise is good (I won't go through that here, you've probably already read it in the description if you are interested to read people's reviews), the acting is good, and--for a lower budget film--the production is quite good. It just seems to fall flat in areas you would expect to fall on the shoulders of the director. For example some scenes tend to slow the momentum and other scenes might as well have been shortened, or deleted altogether.  Overall it wasn't a bad movie at all.  I liked it, and thought it was better than a ""just okay"" three-star rating.  If you like romantic comedy/dramas you probably won't be disappointed.  They aren't my favorite.

The plot is not particularly original, and the scenes are not incredibly original, creative or surprising. There are some holes in the plot--but they can be ignored well enough. However, the acting is fantastic and the characters are appealing--both the lead actors have great comedic timing. The little surprises in plot and dialogue are cute and funny. The characters are realistic and you like them both equally. The filming, editing, and music are done very well.

We found ourselves chuckling out loud quite a bit during the movie, and when it ended, it left us feeling good and happy. We were quite surprised to see one of the scenes shot in a parking lot near our small town in SE Ohio. Small world! But we got a kick out of that!",1346198400,6,925,4.691358024691358

Each scene, though seemingly unimportant on the surface, was artfully crafted, taking on greater meaning and speaking volumes as the movie travels onward.  Though the characters(who are opposites) appear to be running away from their lives, are really reconnecting with them: their pasts and their futures.  All at the same time. Together.  It was amazing.  This movie is HUGE.  I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time.  It's the kind of movie you can't stop thinking about after viewing it.  So, do not turn it off or you'll deprive yourselves of seeing each layer, more emotionally raw than the last one, peeled away.  And you'll realize that no one, on the surface, is really what they seem.  However, you'll feel satisfied by the end of it, because you'll know that each character will heal.  It is a truly amazing story to watch.  The acting was perfect!  Thank you to those who put their hearts and souls into it!  We marveled at it and enjoyed it immensely!

Although most women will love this movie, it is definitely not a chick-flick and guys will like it just as much.  As others have written, there are no special effects, no car chases, and no big name stars.  What is does have is a good story and some wonderful acting.  The scenery is realistic because the movie was actually filmed on a road trip across the country.  The two main stars (Sam and Amber Jaeger) are married in real life and Sam directed this gem.

The music is absolutely amazing, especially the music by Bootstraps (Fortyfive) and all I can say is this is a movie that I bought to keep forever because it is that wonderful.  Watch it and you will see that it will change your heart forever.
