5579100,4,B00BCPOFPS,"Poor Kenchi - stuck on another planet with a lot of lovely ladies, sounds like another Misaki we know and love.  But when the Holy Land is invaded by a power hungry ruler, he must reveal his abilities to protect the innocent.  Now it is a race against time as the crew of the Swan tries to get enough help to take back the Holy Land - but also as more and more ladies try to get Kenchi alone and perhaps married.  Why can't more guys get that lucky???

Overall I enjoyed this series.  The 45 minute episodes might be a little different than most people are used to, but it fits as each one tells a good story.  I enjoy the tenchi's since the beginning and this is a good addition.  If you enjoy the side stories like GXP and Rhy Oh Ohki you will enjoy this.",1372896000,,757,4.074324324324325
5579101,4,B00BCPOFPS,"Babalun, Dagmeyer and the male Sacred Mechamasters have begun their attack on the Holy Land and have captured it!  But with all hope is lost, the women of the Holy Land have one person they can put their trust in...one who may be able to save their lives...Kenshi!

Can Kenshi pull it off and will Kenshi ever return back home?  Or will his friends or the temptation of so many girls wanting to marry him, will make him want to stay? Find out in the final part 2 of ""Tenchi Muyou!: War on Geminar"".

What is ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar""?

In 2009, a spinoff OVA series that is a spin-off of ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was created by original creator Masaki Kajishima.

Presented in 13 OVA episodes which was released from March 2009-March 2010 and produced by AIC Spirits and BeSTACK, the OVA series would lead to a light novel adaptation by Atsushi Wada in 2009, a manga adaptation serialized in Comic REX in 2010 and now released in America on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation (Note: Part 2 comes with episodes 8-13),

According to Kajishima, the anime is part of the ""Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki"" continuity and takes place 15 years after the events of ""Tenchi Muyo! GXP"". Because ""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" features the debut of Tenchi's half brother Kenshi, this would lead many fans to discuss theories of Kenshi and its connection to the original series.

The series revolves around 15-year-old Kenshi Masaki who ended up in an alternate world of Geminar. This world has been waging war against each other using Sacred Mechanoids (humanoid weapons discovered in ancient ruins).

We are first introduced to Lashara Earth XXVIII, the 12-year-old ruler of the Shrtrayu Empire and her bodyguard Chiaia Flan who fights against intruders in the Holy Land. One of these intruders proves to be an excellent fighter and is revealed to be Kenshi.

Kenshi has been ordered to assassinate Lashara Earth XXVIII but can't do it as he is not a killer. Seeing good within Kenshi, as the group hold him captive and to find out his whereabouts, it is quickly learned that Kenshi is not of this world. In fact, he was being used by the enemies of Shtrayu Empire who had promised him a safe return back to his homeworld, which became false.

Finding out he had been betrayed, he is rescued by Dark Elf Aura Shurifon, who returns him back to Lashara. But they realize that he has caught a disease and will die unless he receives treatment. So, everyone works quickly to try and save him.

For now, Kenshi can be useful to the empire who is suffering from enormous debt. So, as they try to find a way for Kenshi to return back home, Lashara Earth XXVIII has Kenshi become her assistant, so he can learn and assimilate with society (which the female population outnumber males by a very large margin). So, naturally many of the women he comes into contact with are impressed by his demeanor, his work ethic and are amazed by his uncanny fighting skills and bravery.

But as Lashara and those working for her try to keep Kenshi's identity secret, there are those in the Holy Land who are working for the enemy and are keeping their eyes on Kenshi.

VIDEO:

""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar - Part 2 is presented in 1080p High Definition. Because the series is an OVA series and not a television series, I was expecting the picture quality to be vibrant and fully-detailed. If anything, ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"" seems more like a television series when it comes to picture quality.

There is a hint of softness, but the series does feature good shading, character and mechanical designs designs but similar to the original series, tends to use a lot of lush backgrounds, blue skies, mountains, a lot of trees, etc. But there are some emphasis on building structures, cement walls and most importantly its use of mechanical designs with Mecha featured throughout the series. There is also a good use of CG for floating structures and backgrounds. There are some indoor scenes which are nicely detailed but overall, picture quality is good but it is a bit soft.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" is presented in Japanese and English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. I have to admit that I was so excited for the lossless soundtrack because the opening theme really comes out crystal clear and utilizes the surround channels immediately. But the overall presentation, while clear, is not as immersive as I would have hoped. Audio is primarily dialogue driven and center and front-channel, while music gets the surround sound treatment. But for a television series, audio is could and didn't notice any difference in terms of surround sound use on both Japanese or English lossless tracks.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have been watching every ""Tenchi Muyo!"" series since it was first released in Japan. A big fan of the original OVA's and animated films, it's always fascinating to see how the storyline is without the characters that fans have followed for many years.

First with ""Tenchi Muyo! GXP"" and now with ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"", what will interest fans the most is the introduction of a 15-year-old named Kenshi, the half brother of Tenchi Masaki. How did this happen? Fans will find theories from other fans about who Kenshi may be. But in terms of the series, we have Kenshi stuck in another world and for the first half, the series is more introductory to the characters and a secret plot taking place behind-the-scenes.

The second half of ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"" focuses on Babalun and his son Dagmyer along with the male Sacred Mechmasters of the Academy capturing the Holy Land.  But also Babalun possessing the Shield of Gaia and trying to defeat Kenshi and restore the Sacred Mechalord Gaia.  But to save the land, Kenshi must do all that is necessary to stop Gaia's revival.

The series does tend to play out as a harem anime series with flocks of women, not just a few, wanting to marry Kenshi.  But fortunately, a much more deeper storyline is presented in the final half of the OVA series.

There are references to the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" characters in the anime series such as Washu and others when Kenshi is questioned about his home and these crystals that belong to him. But also his unusual abilities that surpass normal people in the planet.

As mentioned in my review of ""part 1, there is a little sexual humor in the series, so you may not want to watch this series with children in the room.

As for the Blu-ray release, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised that the OVA series looked more like a television series. Back in the day, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was a series that captivated our attention at anime club screenings as the series was known as a quality series on LaserDisc at the time. Fast forward to 2010, when this series was first released, while shown on the Animax pay per view channel, I was hoping for sharper, crisper animation and less softness. But the series was soft and while many scenes did have good detail for its art backgrounds and some scenes and characters were well-shaded, it seemed more like the picture quality of a TV series than OVA series.

As for the lossless soundtrack, I loved how the music was utilized for the surround channels but I was hoping the action sequences would feature a bit more LFE and surround use. Dialogue and music are crystal clear but was hoping for something more immersive.

For special features, you get many of the Japanese special features included such as the commercial previews or trailers, a behind-the-scenes radio featurette and an audio commentary featuring the English dub voice talent and the FUNimation crew that worked on the series.

Overall, ""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" is a harem sci-fi anime series that is enjoyable and fun.  While the first half of the series is more about the fun and harem side of Tenchi, his gullible nature and the women who love him, there is more story, more action and things become a bit more deeper for the second and final of the OVA series.

If you are a fan of ""Tenchi Muyo!"", while none of the original characters appear in this OVA series, we are introduced to Kenshi Masaki, a 15-year-old half brother of Tenchi that is stuck in an alternate world and with his kind nature and his special ability, he proves himself as important in the lives of many people.  But will he stay or will he go home back to Earth?

""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar - Part 2 is recommended for fans who love sci-fi anime with a harem twist!",1372896000,7,9619,4.733653269346131

5579105,4,B00BCPOFPS,"Other than a few mentions and one flash of one the characters from the tenchi series, War on Geminar is a complete stand alone series. There is some character development but not much. However the story is solid, the characters are likable and memorable. This is a harem but the male lead is not some pathetic pushover that doesn't deserve a following. For only having thirteen episodes, though long, the series gets a lot done for story and plot progression. There really isn't a pointless episode. Every episode leads into the next smoothly and moves the story forward. There is fan-service but I would be hard pressed to find a harem anime without any.

5579149,3,B00BCPOFPS,"Again, this is not Tenchi Muyo! And it was only titled so for American release. I guess it was done as an appeal for those fans of the Tenchi series, movies and OVAs.

Much like the first part of the series the second is choppy and skips around when it comes to the story telling. There is also no closure to the story besides ending the current arc. It's like the director was planning to expand on this part of the Tenchi universe but a second season was never picked up. Thus leaving the series with several unanswered questions and an open ending. The way they also try to tie this series to the first two OVA, Tenchi Muyo! and Ryo-Ohki, is also quite unbelievable; let alone leave several plot holes to be answered for those first two series.

In all, it was watchable but I would leave it as a rental or borrow from a friend as this collection would only take up space on your shelves.",1389657600,3,891,4.2976190476190474
