8396172,5,B003FSU55Y,Great series.  Animation is dated but gets the job done.  Beautiful backgrounds and character designs with a solid pulp story stretched across the whole season. Holds up well.,1457913600,,175,5.214285714285714

8396174,4,B003FSU55Y,"The DVD is missing the last two episodes of the first season, and is completely missing any from season two.  Still... since this is the ONLY product out there for Filmation's series, this is better than nothing",1442880000,5,211,4.702702702702703

8396178,3,B003FSU55Y,"Filmation did a number of cartoon productions with mixed results.  Better than Hanna Barbara's offerings, Filmation did try to make their human characters look human, instead of stylized caricature of people.  But, even so, the Flash Gordon tale is a bit stilted and slowed from the original 1930 black and white serial.

Still, the fact that it's animated means that this series can create shots that would otherwise be impossible to get with a live action cast and a budget to match.  Even so, this is more aimed at children as a simple adventure series, than as a series aimed at young adults with some romantic intrigue invested into the tale.

It would be interesting to see a proper animated tale of the Flash Godon series.  Maybe someday.",1395100800,3,745,4.78125

8396180,3,B003FSU55Y,"Okay storyline, but definitely dated. The animation is okay and the storylines are simplistic. Good value for the price but definitely not a blockbuster.",1374451200,3,153,5.416666666666667
