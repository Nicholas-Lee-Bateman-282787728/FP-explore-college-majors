770246,3,6304057679,"""Grease"" is a classic and great movie. It will get a 5-star rating. ""Grease 2"" should never have been made! It deserves no stars at all! What were they thinking??? Certain movies will never merit a sequel - ""Grease"" is one of those movies.

You'd be better off just buying the original.",1176163200,3,286,4.5

770383,1,6304057679,"This is a wide-screen version of Grease. That is, about 20% of the top and bottom  of each frame has been chopped off for your viewing displeasure, leaving the film editors trying (not always successfully) to keep the original heads and feet in each frame. This butchery is especially bad for films with large-group dance numbers, as Grease is. The result is a jerky, visually bothersome film where you might just want to turn off the picture and just listen to the sound track, those great R&R numbers. BUT, sound in the big set-piece songs is annoyingly muddy and echo-y - a problem that isn't present in the rest of the film (and wasn't in the original), so it must have been intentional here. Bad idea.
  Grease 2 features some of the same actors as Grease (1), but just comes off as hastily and clumsily put together. The choreography in some of the early scenes is pretty good, though.
  The best part of the set is a documentary of the party celebrating the 25th anniversary of the DVD release of Grease (1). Fine and moving.",1498262400,2,1032,4.556756756756757

Like many others, I too find Grease 2 a bit of a flop, especially considering the renown of the original. But it's still a fun movie, with many of the same endearing characteristics as its predecessor. And hey, who doesn't enjoy seeing a young Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her earliest roles??

I once owned the two movies separately, on VHS. This two-disc DVD is perfect for efficient storage and to keep companion films together - no more searching for one after you've seen the other!",1439942400,,662,4.706896551724138

Good times and reminds me of my carefree childhood days when I didn't have to worry about car notes, car insurance and the daily job. lol Both of these are in widescreen format, which is good, because virtually everyone has widescreen TVs now and we are in the digital era. Analog, square TVs, and VHS are finally gone. GREASE is the ROCKIN' RYDELL EDITION here in this set with the same features as sold separately. GREASE 2 only has the theatrical trailer for special features, but I am glad to have it on DVD just as well and if you are a fan of both of these movies, you cannot pass this set up. I got mine at a local retailer for a mere five bucks. Enjoy because GREASE IS THE WORD!",1428710400,,784,4.198675496688741

It was neat that the principal, assistant principal,coach, and Frenchy were in both movies. Eve Arden was outstanding in both movies and played a part that reminds one of her role in Our Miss Brooks. Sid Ceasar played a humerous coach which gave a lot of laughter. I would highly reccomend both movies if you like rock musicals from the 50's & 60's and are classics for that time period.",1390089600,,547,4.48

Rydell High is the home to two groups which are home to the coolest kids in school- The T-Birds and the Pink Ladies. In the first movie a summer romance between the leader of the T-Birds and an Australian blonde causes a shift in the subtle flow of the senior class of Rydell. Is it better to be the all American jock to keep Sandy or to stay a member of the T-Birds? is a question he will have to answer. In the second movie 2 years later Sandy's cousin moves here from England and begins his own senior year at Rydell. Something of a brainiac he doesn't quite fit in but that doesn't stop him for falling for one of the Pink Ladies.",1300060800,7,861,4.070588235294117

Grease is one of my favourite musical films ever which was released in 1978. I love Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta and the love story storyline and of course the fantastic soundtrack including Summer Nights, You're The One That I Want, Sandy and Greased Lightnin'. It brings back so many fantastic memories of my childhood as I was only [...]at the time.

Grease 2 was released in 1982 and all though it is not up to the standard of the Grease storyline it is a great movie in it's own right and didn't get the recognition it deserved. Maxwell Caulfield, Michelle Pfeiffer and Adrian Zmed star in this very funny love story. It has a great soundtrack with songs such as Reproduction and We'll Be Together.

If you like musical films then Grease and Grease 2 are the ones you should have in your DVD collection. Also the soundtracks to Grease and Grease 2 are a must have for your CD collection to.",1180051200,26,1077,4.402010050251256
