8367759,5,B002EIJ8RC,"I love all of Lee Williams and the Spiritual QC's music. if you allow other people to Steal your Joy. you are the unhappy.  I know the God gave me Another Chance.  God has been So Goo To Me and my love ones.  I just can't thank Him enough. Since I met God my life has truly changed. Every song touch your life in some way. Thanks Mr. Williams, and the QC'c.",1388102400,,357,3.9305555555555554
8367760,3,B002EIJ8RC,"First of all I must say that I love Lee Williams & The Spiritual QCs. I buy every CD and DVD that they record because they are one of favorite groups. This DVD ""Fall on Me"" was a dissappointment to me. I bought the CD and it seemed rather dull so I ordered the DVD and immediately felt as if they were holding back and not allowing the spirit to move in them. It is not the Lee Williams that I know and love. Most of the songs were more depressing than uplifting. I am still a fan but I pray that the next CD and DVD will be much better than this one. I also agree with the review about the poor quality of this DVD, the quality seem homemade and not professional. Lee we  know that God has even greater things in store for you. I will continue to support you!",1272499200,,760,3.9673202614379086
8367761,3,B002EIJ8RC,"I own both the CD and DVD of the Fall On Me album by Lee Williams & The Spritual QC's. I love the music but in my DVD, the people were way behind the beat making everyone that was dancing and shouting look like they were off beat. The film editing didn't have everyone in sync. The videographers suck and should not ever be used again due to their lack of quality.  I only gave it a 3 stars because of the music part. I love Lee Williams but they should shop around for someone who can get the job done right. Great spiritual uplifting music though. God bless my brothers and sisters in Christ.",1258761600,,594,4.165217391304348
8367762,3,B002EIJ8RC,I was very disappointed in the quality of the videotaping.  The color was very bad.  It even looked like black and white at times and their faces looked weird.  I have all of Lee Williams DVDs and they have all been of high quality so I don't know what happened to his latest DVD.  Whoever he used to produce this DVD should never be used again.  I was so excited to get his latest DVD but what a huge letdown.,1256601600,,410,4.075
