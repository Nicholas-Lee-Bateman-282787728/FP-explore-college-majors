It contains no Santa spoilers, so can be watched by the youngest Who fans not frightened by monsters.",1419552000,3,265,4.866666666666666
6867088,5,B00QGQFOHG,"This Christmas special was fantastic! Totally enjoyed watching it with my family. Just the right mix of Christmas cheer, humor, sadness and creepiness. Loved it! Written by Moffat and it is one of his best. Great Santa one liners.

Only need to purchase the actual Christmas show. Don't bother with the extras.",1419552000,2,310,4.961538461538462
6867089,5,B00QGQFOHG,This was unexpectedly good and a bit unnerving. I think all of us fear the possibility of not really ever waking up. That's a fear we all have buried somewhere in our minds from some terrifying split second in our earlier life. It creeps up from time to time. I would just hope to not go back there anymore lol. I will welcome the experience one last time for one last Christmas. Thanks BBC.,1419552000,9,391,4.297297297297297

I used to kind of cringe at the thought of Clara and Twelve having chemistry, but now I totally dig it lol. And they have sizzling chemistry. Although it's subdued the slightest touch is so electrifying in my opinion. Yeah I still miss the intense flirty chemistry of Clara and Eleven, but I can feel a deep love between Clara and Twelve. I can't explain it haha. Anyways, loved this episode. It's hilarious how Santa Claus was played by Nick Frost. What a perfect name haha.",1490054400,2,631,4.592920353982301

6867156,5,B00QGQFOHG,"Last Christmas, because every Christmas is last Christmas. This is the DVD of the 2014 Doctor Who holiday episode and it has a solid balance of Santa, sci-fi and substance. And, the storyline is sufficiently complex to elevate it above normal holiday fluff.

The video of the hour-long program is sharp and clear and the extras include episode commentary and a fourteen minute making of featurette. Hard to go wrong with Tardis, Dream Crabs, feisty Santa, snarky elves, lots of snow and warm Christmas lights. A favorite part is the childhood glee on the Doctor's face as he takes the reins and drives Santas sleigh. The DVD is one that warrants a viewing every Christmas.",1454544000,,672,4.843478260869565

6867169,3,B00QGQFOHG,"This is my first glimpse of the newest Doctor Who (Peter Capaldi).  I remain indifferent.  As for this Christmas special, it is based on confusion, features confusion, and relies solely on confusion as the Doctor and everyone else is in a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream....................  Santa shows up to add to the confusion.  And this Santa (Nick Frost) should be featured on his own naughty list.  He is a bit of a rogue, snarky and sarcastic.  He is one of the best elements in this peculiar episode.  But I didn't enjoy it as much as I have some of the other Christmas specials.

6867232,1,B00QGQFOHG,"I've wanted to do a review of this so-called X-Mas Specail since last Christmas when it aired on BBC America
looking back maybe it's better i waited probably would've been banned or flagged or God knows what
The bottom line is The Last Christmas is one of the Worst X-mas Special I've ever seen
I've been watching tv/films along time 32 years give or take I've seen lots and lots of very tacky/over the top Christmas Specials from typical cheesy 1980's sitcoms to various animated sitcoms, etc.
This takes the fruit cake if you will It's a special kind of Horrid cause it's so bloody cheap and unoriginal

Being a long time Dr. Who fan (Classic and Re-Boot) and watching this last X-mas Special  was maybe one of the worst Christmas ever!
Besides that time Santa never brought me the  He-Man and The MOTU Eternia Playset

Mostly due to it's sheer stupidity
I'm not talking about the  Doctor meeting up with Santa that was actually the least of all the broken writing
I'm talking about the blatant rip-off
of Alien and Aliens and how cheap and unoriginal it all was
Somehow BBC was able to con Nick Frost  to make two appearances in Dr. Who
as Santa Claus of all people and he does he's best for the time he's on screen
But, they kind of underused him in the The Last Christmas
It was meant to bridge the gap between Death in Heaven and the Last Christmas
but, they managed to even mess that up yes Danny Pink makes a pop-in for a few min. but, it means Nothing
This whole episode means Nothing cause all the Space Marines are in a deep sleep dreaming everything that happened during the entire last Christmas Story it's such a cheap stereotypical sci fi cop-out

This whole episode is like a very bad joke with no real punch line
 Go watch Alien then Aliens forget this ever happened this was beyond silly and worthless
this is one of the lowest points in all the Dr. Who's Legacy
and in many ways a smack in the face of all Doctor Who fans (Is this the best they can do??)

Basically Clara and the Doctor are stranded on the North Pole being attacked by face-hugging alien crabs when who should save them but... Santa Claus!

So it uses two of Doctor Who's standard plots, alien monsters and meeting historical/mythical figures but does it in a clever new way (which I won't spoil) and the chemistry between Clara, the Doctor and Santa is fantastic.

It's a bit dark for a Christmas special, a bit too scary for small kids but overall it's a winner.

I have one quibble, the ending teases a daring change but then backs away from it.  It's a real shame because going with the ending they teased would have made this a classic.",1441152000,,808,4.6223776223776225

6867268,1,B00QGQFOHG,"So there we were, waiting patiently, or a little impatiently as it were, for the Doctor Who Christmas episode to be released on Amazon. My wife and I both reeling from what can only be summed up as a bad dream that was Moffat's season 8 of the Doctor. ""Surely"" this Christmas special will not be as bad as the season"" we thought. ""Obviously they are going to bring in the big guns for the script, tie in Season 8 in a way that will make it NOT feel like a poorly translated anime series, and give us something to look forward too for Season 9"" we discussed at length. So there we were, contemplating our evening entertainment. My wife desperate to like this Season, and this regenerated Doctor who has apparently devolved into a crabby old crazy man who REALLY hates soldiers and human beings, insisted we watch the Christmas special. Me, longing for past Doctors where even the war Doctor, who while contemplating ending two races of intelligent life, had more endearing qualities than this current Doctor who you'd rather travel back in time to the 19th century to get a root canal done that go to tea with this grumpy, jerk who's Scottish accent makes it even more hard not to want to smack his scrunched up, overly distorted face. So of course we decided to spend the next moments of our life to see what happens next in the adventures of an awkward friendship travels through time and space, it has to be great right? It wasn't, I'd have rather watched the Kardashians while having my legs waxed then sit through this episode again. The ONLY time it was entertaining was the few brilliant moments of Nick Frost (of Shaun of the Dead fame) who is HILARIOUS as old Saint Nick. Other than that, this episode is abysmal. Moffat, relying too heavily on wibbly wobbly timey whimey to tell this tale, cannot escape the severe chasm that exists between Clara and the Doctor no matter how hard he tries to force us into believing that these two ant-companions somehow have such a deep care for each other that it is OBVIOUS they will be traveling through time and space in Season 9 and it's going to be so FANTASTIC!!! Moffat, continuing to prove he is no show runner, and Capalid continuing to prove that while he may have made a great Doctor in the 1960's with his grumpiness and disdain for all things human and soldiers, is by far the worst Doctor to ever be called the doctor. The only thing in my mind that could save Season 9 is if they regenerate the Doctor in episode 2.",1439769600,2,2475,4.477876106194691

The whole package is in North Pole, Alaska, USA.  I saw this (otherwise great special) and had trouble with The Doctor not knowing about any of this.. I mean it'd be a quick trip for him to see North Pole, its a vacation spot now for goodness sake. He could have even and said ""Well all of those things are there BUT none of its magic,"" or ""I'll prove it too you *Tardis* look its....well, its not MAGIC"". Trivial?

6867308,4,B00QGQFOHG,"This felt far more like a series finale rather than the typical Doctor Who Christmas special. Last Christmas takes an incredibly difficult task and pulls it off: including Santa Claus in the story without the story going completely off the rails. The Episode succeeds beautifully. Last Christmas manages to mix in a little bit of horror, a bit of comedy, and the character drama between Clara and the Doctor that has really worked so well throughout the Eighth Series.

Superb performances make this work. Nick Frost is great as Santa, making his role believable and bringing the perfect mix of humor and seriousness to the role. And then there's Jenna Louise Coleman and especially Peter Capaldi who continue to be one of the most impressive acting duo to play Companion and Doctor. Capaldi's performance was superb as this story really seemed to mark a shift in the twelfth Doctor. The Big Smile we see late in the episode when it comes across the face of what has been one of the most grumpy Doctors in Doctor Who history. While I love the audio medium, Capaldi and Coleman show the advantage Television and Movies can have but, so rarely do. With these the facial expressions, hugs, and gestures speak volumes because they do them so well.

The plot has been done before and yes ""Amy's Choice"" was somewhat better in the way they dealt with dreams, but I think that ""Last Christmas"" manages to do something very different with all the elements it has. The plot has logical holes, but unlike many Steven Moffat stories, there's a lot that can be forgiven because of the ""dream"" portion of the story. Some of it, particularly the ending are left up for interpretation. The rest of the guest cast is servicable but not really outstanding.

Still, I think it was a wonderful special. It managed to tell a good story, be relevant to the ongoing series, and leave people with some thoughts to ponder and how life is too short for lies and unforgiveness.",1436140800,,1951,4.715542521994135
6867309,5,B00QGQFOHG,"What a great episode; wonderfully twisty plot.  I absolutely love the combination of Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman.  Capaldi is one of the most complex and layered Doctors we've seen.  I really hope they start writing to more of this strengths.  Jenna is the perfect companion for him; independent.  She loves him as a best friend, but also becomes infuriated with him as one can a best friend.  I hope she stays around for awhile.",1435881600,,433,4.706666666666667

6867325,3,B00QGQFOHG,"The Doctor and Santa Claus team up to save the world from yet another alien invasion during Christmas. This time, the action isn't in London, it's at the North Pole. A group of scientists are trying to save their comrades from the Dream Crabs, alien beasts who grip onto people's faces and slowly suck their brains away while inducing a dream state so the victims don't mind that they are losing their minds.

The episode has an interesting set up but steals liberally from many classic science fiction movies, mostly obviously the Face-huggers from Alien and the arctic setting from The Thing From Another World. The characters in the episode even acknowledge it--perhaps the writers trying to look like they're clever rather than they're plagarists. Clearly, I wasn't impressed by the lack of creativity.

The actors are good as usual. Peter Capaldi has great screen presence and Nick Frost is a likeable and unique enough Santa to make the character fresh. Plenty of funny lines lighten the mood and had me laughing out loud.

On the other hand, the dramatic story felt slow and dragged out. I did get a bit bored with the same problems recurring too many times (again the writers aiming for clever and not hitting the mark). As I said above, there was too much taken from other, better stories like Alien and The Thing. Another ultimately disappointing outing for the Doctor.",1434240000,,1379,4.834745762711864

Clara's head is clearing up from the loss of her short lived, but intense love and is continuing to understand the differences between the Matt Smith Doctor and the Peter Capaldi Doctor.  I really hope that Clara and the Doctor have a long and interesting relationship in saving everyone in the universe.",1433894400,,471,4.465116279069767

6867332,3,B00QGQFOHG,"I normally look forward to the Christmas special every year, but I had already heard that Clara was not making her exit, so I actually didn't watch this until June. Yep, June. And I fell asleep about halfway through, because I think I've already heard Clara whine enough. So this isn't my usual, let me be objective kind of review. This is me whining about Clara's whining.
I feel really bad for Peter Capaldi, because I really like his Doctor. A lot. I just feel that Clara is not a good match as companion. She is written as overly emotional and self centered as a character. All of her drama is boring and old and to have all of it in a show that is primarily for kids is not really appropriate. The Christmas special itself is supposed to be about the magic of Christmas and not the drama of a personal relationship. If  I wanted to watch that, I would change the channel to Lifetime.",1433808000,2,888,4.349397590361446

I don't get why some people got tired of Clara already, I think she is awesome, I think the whole Danny Pink diversion was a big mistake, bringing him then discarding him that quickly!

The 12th Doctor brings the wit of the 4th, the lovable grumpiness of the 1st, and the mystery of the 7th into his latest incarnation. And no flirting! Last Christmas was a perfect bookend to a fine season that started so well with Deep Breath. Our whole family enjoyed it. The kids liked the comedy elves and snarky Santa. The adults did, too, but were also riveted by the character development and Inception-style story line. Last Christmas will always be on our rewatch list.",1427241600,,569,4.588235294117647

6867446,5,B00QGQFOHG,"I was really still struggling with getting used to Peter Capaldi as the new Doctor when this episode finally made it click for me. You go through a heartbreak and mourning phase every time the Doctor regenerates, but his newest personality has been the hardest to get used to. With David Tennant leaving and Matt Smith taking over you had a clean break with all the previous companions. Now Clara has to deal with the change over and Peter's Doctor is not what I would have hoped for. This episode really showed the kind of Doctor that I hoped was still inside.

I typically don't rent shows, but I couldn't wait for this to go prime, even my mother who has never seen Doctor Who enjoyed it. The show is getting a little darker and edgier, and I love it.

While I still miss Eleven, I still can't stand Clara but even she seems to be less annoying in this one.  The doctor meets Santa Claus and in true DW style Santa is more than he seems. One shouldn't go into a Doctor Who special with too much warning.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

6867454,3,B00QGQFOHG,It was an alright episode. Somehow they sucked the fun out of watching capaldi and Clara's character still feels shallow. She still seems like just a pretty face that gets the Doctor hot and bothered. Nick Frost was great in this and that My little pony joke gave me the giggles.

6867457,5,B00QGQFOHG,"The Doctor arrives on Clara's rooftop just after Santa Claus. He's in a hurry and rushes Clara into the TARDIS, and then says to Santa, ""I know what this is. I know what's happening. And I know what's at stake.""
Santa: ""I don't think you do, Doctor. But I promise, before this Christmas Day is done, you'll be glad of my help.""

The TARDIS lands at the North Pole where the members of a polar expedition are in grave danger. Four people from their party, they call them sleepers, have alien creatures wrapped around their heads. If you get too close to them or even think about them, they attack. The first time one of the aliens opens its mouth and you see the sleeping human face underneath is truly creepy.

A predator that works telepathically and puts you in a happy dream state so you can't tell what's real and what isn't. The Doctor snaps, ""You know what the big problem is in telling fantasy and reality apart? They're both ridiculous.""

Awesome blackboard!
The real pluck-the-heartstrings moments in this special comes from Clara's love, Danny Pink. When she says she misses him, he tells her, ""Five minutes. You can miss me for five minutes a day. And you better do it properly. You better be sad. I expect my five. But all the rest of the time... every single second, you just get the hell on with it.""

This Christmas special originally aired on December 25, 2014. It is 45 minutes long and presented in 16:9 anamorphic with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. English subtitles are available for the episode itself.

The single disc (whether DVD and BluRay) has two bonus features:
1. ""Behind the Scenes: Last Christmas"" (14 minutes) A look behind the scenes while they're filming this Christmas special. Commentators include Nick Frost (plays Santa), Peter Capaldi (plays the 12th Doctor), Steven Moffat (lead writer and exec. producer), Jenna Coleman (plays Clara), Faye Marsay (plays Shona), Nathan McMullen (plays Wolf, the elf), Natalie Gumede (plays Ashley Carter), Michael Troughton (plays Professor Albert), Maureen Beattie (plays Bellows), Dan Starkey (plays Jan the elf) and Danny Hargreaves (special effects supervisor).
Troughton is, yes, THAT Troughton. Patrick Troughton, Doctor #2 was his dad (Patrick died in 1987), Michael remembers being on set when he was a kid.
Moffat: ""One creepy thing that I've always been slightly obsessed with has been the dream that keeps going after you've woken up. I've had that quite a few times. In the morning I think 'Oh, I don't wanna get up.' Then I get up and I get dressed, finally, and then I wake up again!""
Dan Starkey is better known to Dr. Who fans as the immensely popular character, Strax. ""After a good seven years of being inside a rubber suit on Dr. Who, inside a mask, it's refreshing to actually have my own face on screen.""
2. Commentary track by Paul Wilmshurst (director) and Paul Frift (producer). This isn't the most scintillating commentary ever, but it was still fun listening to some inside information about sets and lighting and lenses. In particular, they point out something in the very first scene of the introductory sequence, something very important, something that will make you say ""Aha!"" and tell people you knew what was going on all along. Now, I didn't see it until they mentioned it in the commentary, so I won't give it away just in case you're as bad at noticing things as me.
They talk about how great Nick Frost is as Santa (the white make-up kept blowing off his beard), and how having this feel-good iconic figure works in this science fiction story: ""Steve [Moffat] says he's introduced Santa in a proper science fiction way into the world of Dr. Who.... This is science fiction, it's not whimsy.""

I will admit I had just a tiny bit of trouble suspending disbelief at the end regarding the lack of lasting physical damage in the five survivors. Though it's not as bad as my favorite unlikely recovery, the end of ""Total Recall"" (1990 with Arnold Schwartzenegger). But that's nitpicking - and there is so much to enjoy about ""Last Christmas"".

""Do you know why people get together at Christmas? Every time they do, it might be the last time. Every Christmas is Last Christmas.""

I keep on watching hoping for the great stories with  Doctor's 9 and 10 and early 11.  ( I grew up watching 4) but not yet.  I do not like this doctor or this companion, but I think that is more a reflection of the scripts than the characters or actors.
This one takes you on a dream journey, no wait a dream dream journey, no wait again a dream, dream, dream journey.  Is Santa real?  Who cares at this point.  Do he and the Doctor have a past or is that all dream, too?  Slightly confusing action, plot devices pulled out of a hat, characters that make no sense, oops that is part of the dream, too?

6867492,5,B00QGQFOHG,"I haven't been a fan of Mr. Capaldi as the Doctor, but I have to say this was a pretty cool episode. I thought it might be too cheesy, at first (with Santa showing up and all), but it turned out to be quite entertaining. The writers worked the whole Santa thing out in a very interesting way. I think this is one of the few episodes where Mr. Capaldi has presented himself as a Doctor with strength and charisma. Something I'm sad to say has been lacking (at least in my opinion) in almost all of his previous episodes as The Doctor. I'd recommend this one to any Doctor Who fan out there. For those who are just getting into the Who series, I highly recommend going back to the beginning and starting with Season One in 2005. It's an amazing series!",1423872000,,750,4.251748251748252

6867496,5,B00QGQFOHG,"As the Doctor and Clara both deal with their lives after the events of The Mistress and the Cybermen several months have passed.  In fact its Christmas Eve and Clara is alone without Danny Pink or even the Doctor.  That is until a noise awakens her and to her discovery finds out that Father Christmas is real and aided by two elves.  HIs sleigh crashed and his reindeer flying around he tries to pick the pieces up and be on his way to deliver the toys to all the good boys and girls of Earth.  However the Doctor arrives and tells Clara to get in the TARDIS.  With a cryptic message from Father Christmas about giving him his help before the night is out the Doctor and Clara travel to an artic base in the North Pole.
  Once there they find a small group of scientists trying desperately to figure out what has happen to their other crew members.  The Doctor can't explain it and further more can't explain why everyone seems to be giving the same story about being in the base to start with since its clear that everyone is not what they appear.  Even stranger still Father Christmas and his elves have arrived on the scene to help with the situation.
  Can the Doctor figure out why all these things are connected?  What does Father Christmas have to do with it all?  And what is this base really hiding that will terrify them all?  You'll just have to watch and find out in the Doctor Who Christmas special ""Last Christmas"".",1423353600,,1430,4.387832699619772

6867506,5,B00QGQFOHG,"Finally, an episode where Capaldi stole my heart and passed as an amazing Doctor! I've been hoping to connect with him all season but felt that the writers weren't giving us much to work with. His screen time seemed limited or something.

Anyways, this one is one of my new favorites. I have a favorite for each doctor, and this one takes the cake for Capaldi.

Loved watching it, rewatched it a couple times. Was definitely worth the purchase!",1422144000,4,444,4.6075949367088604
6867507,3,B00QGQFOHG,"I think it is time to stop having a Christmas special on Doctor Who every year.  The show got along fine for 26 ""classic"" years and one modern year without a Christmas special, and it can do so again.  If the writers come up with a GOOD Christmas-oriented show, then have a Christmas special.  Otherwise, don't do it.  Of the 7 Christmas specials so far, only ""The Christmas Invasion,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""The Snowmen"" rate as being slightly above average among all the modern episodes to date, and the other 4 rate anywhere from average to rotten.  I would rate the 2014 version as being 4th among the Christmas specials to date.

Regarding this year's version, the (admittedly difficult) attempt to combine scary monsters similar to the thing from Alien with light-hearted interactions between The Doctor and Santa Claus almost works.  The ending is contrived and had to be changed at the last minute, because this episode was supposed to get rid of Clara, but Jenna Coleman changed her mind about leaving the show after the script for this story was written.  The interaction between The Doctor and Clara is OK in this episode, but I don't think these two have ever generated the chemistry that existed between Clara and the 11th Doctor, especially in ""The Snowmen,"" or the chemistry between Rose Tyler and the 9th or 10th Doctor.  I had high hopes for Clara after ""The Snowmen,"" but I now wish she had left after ""Last Christmas.""  The 12th Doctor also needs to evolve some.  I don't mind that he is so weird -- Tom Baker was also like this.  However, he was just plain antisocial throughout most of the 8th season, and for no obvious reason.  The 9th Doctor also had anger management issues, but there was an underlying context to explain this (the Time War), and this did not detract from the 1st modern season.",1422144000,,1823,4.677115987460815
6867508,5,B00QGQFOHG,as described,1421971200,,12,5.5
6867509,5,B00QGQFOHG,"First off, I think Peter Capaldi is brilliant as the Doctor and I have enjoyed Jenna Coleman's overall performance as Clara in her two seasons.  I agree with the reviewers, however, who have stated a desire for a new companion.  I'm hoping for it to be Faye Marsay, whose Shona shone in the opening sequence of this episode and who would be comic gold next to Capaldi's Doctor.  I'm hoping because in the episode's sleigh ride epilogue Shona asked is she and Clara could be friends thereafter and Clara said yes.  I don't hate that Jenna is coming back, but it sounded in the press that she had decided to leave but had changed her mind at the last minute- story has it that the end of Last Christmas had to be rewritten at a late date due to Jenna's change of mind- and, for me, that tarnishes her return somewhat and it forestalls the excitement and freshness that comes with getting a shiny new companion.  All that said, the episode is intelligent and for that is not an easy watch: meaning, the audience has to stretch their mental muscles to keep up with the dream-state-not-dream-state nature of the plot, as ambitious a write as Moffat has penned since Silence In The  Library with (the) Doctor Moon.  Only the ending seems a bit tacked-on, only because it literally was.  Excellent performances throughout, including yet another Patrick Troughton son in a good role.  Perhaps a Christmas special more for veteran Who fans than newcomers, but it once again stamps the show's claim to being the best sci-fi/fantasy program on the air anywhere in the world.",1421884800,30,1563,4.675182481751825

6867516,5,B00QGQFOHG,"This Christmas episode has done the same thing for Peter Capaldi that Matt Smith's first Xmas outing did with Kathryn Jenkins.  It has catapulted him to 'top drawer' as he ends his first season following Matt Smith.  The entire production, writing and acting teams are just fantastic in weaving yet another highly creative tale under Stephen Moffat's direction.  'In my dreams', Doctor Who is just a fantastic effort by BBC that I hope will dream on forever.  This is a GREAT Christmas episode, but you need to watch the entire season before you'll catch on.

6867521,5,B00QGQFOHG,"This was one of the most clever episodes of the current season. It was more like what Dr Who should be with a bad guy alien who's motives and plan aren't obvious, forcing The Doctor to be clever and figure it all out. This season lacked a lot of that and focused more on how the new Doctor is weird and anti social and how that bothered Clara.

This was back to what it's supposed to be.

And the Santa Clause angle wasn't campy like I was CERTAIN it was going to be. It actually played quite well into the plot without being hokey at all.",1421020800,,539,4.0754716981132075

6867523,5,B00QGQFOHG,"This was actually cool.  And on several levels - the story itself; but also, as you may know, this Doctor is not everyone's favorite by far.  ""I got a second chance"", he says.  Well, I think the Doctor's writers want a second chance to improve the stories (by a lot, hopefully) - and cut the bitterness between the Doctor and Clara - to get back to a symbiotic relationship and not an argumentative one as was with this entire season of the new Doctor.  Good luck, hope you deliver :)",1420934400,,484,4.344444444444444

It is the perfect blend of whimsical and cerebralism; much like Peter Capaldi's incarnation of the Doctor. Nick Frost was cast perfectly as Saint Nicholas and Santa was not afraid to challenge the Doctor; this made some delightful humor. A fair warning  Last Christmas might be too scary for young kids. The Crabs are very similar to Facehuggers from Alien. This concept might be terrifying for young kids and it was freaky for this adult. Despite my warning  Last Christmas is my favorite Doctor Who Christmas special.",1420761600,,594,4.93

6867527,3,B00QGQFOHG,I was a little dissapointed in this one. It seemed like it was rushed. While not trying to spoil the ending it seemed to have left you open with to many questions and no real definite answer. I wish they would of went into more of the back story as to how everyone ended up where they were. in my opinion they should of taken a little more time with the back story and cut out some of the things that didn't need to be in.,1420761600,,422,3.9186046511627906
6867528,2,B00QGQFOHG,"I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, but this episode was just plain bad.  And not the good kind of bad.  It was predictable, repetitive, and unoriginal.  The writers simply took facehuggers from Aliens and duck taped Santa to the side.

This doesn't tie up any loose ends that series 8 left unanswered but it does dive further into the relationship between the Doctor and Clara. If you're a Doctor Who fan then this is a must watch. If you're new to the series then keep moving. Go back to Eccleston's 9th Doctor and start there.  Nick Frost was great as Santa and I hope he'll return someday, even though characters from the Christmas specials rarely return with the exception of Donna Noble and her Grandfather.",1420675200,,602,4.626168224299065

The best bit is the toying with the question of Doctor being real or the figment of imagination. Capaldi had finally grown into the skin of the Doctor, it is genuine pleasure to finally see this incarnation fully on. Clara has also grown strong and deep, and she is probably the companion with the toughest story since Donna. Relationship development between her and Doctor is probably the actual center point in this one, and it is done subtly and masterfully.

It also made me like the new Doctor a lot more. I am still not over the departure of the last Doctor but I liked the vulnerability displayed by the current Doctor Who. The dream within a dream within a dream structure was interesting. I had read on line that some were speculating that Santa might be a fellow time lord.

I am glad Clara and the Doctor are back together after all the pain they suffered on their own from their losses, but really not a story to shine in our memories, such as the beautiful Christmas Carol story, the magical land of living Christmas Trees, or the memory snow episodes.

Nick Frost as Nick Frost is the perfection of being.  Unfortunately, not even this convergence of wonder can save us from the doomed and dismal slope that Mr. Moffat insits to impose upon us.  Steven Moffat is the most virulent plague nesting within the multi-dimensional-time-rift that our beloved Doctor travels, and our Doctor is the lesser.
Our Doctor Runs, The Doctor is the wibbily wobbly timey wimey . . . stuff.  The Doctor is the Passsion and the Life, the interconnectivity throughout time and space . . . RTD brought us that Doctor . . . Moffat has slayed him with his blue buffoonery.
This man does Not Run, he has No passion, he is the 'woe is me' of the Time Lords, a self flagellating morose echo of The Oncoming Storm.
""You are tiny. I can see the whole of time and space, every single atom of your existence, and I divide them.""  These are the actions of the Doctor and his companions.

I have not been happy that Clara was leaving the Doctor at the end of the year.

6867689,5,B00QGQFOHG,"I've always dreaded the Christmas episodes, with their emphasis on the Christmas and not on the drama. There have been some good ones (e.g., The End of Time), but by and large, they've been pretty weak.

This time, the season as a whole had been pretty disappointing, so I could only imagine how bad the Christmas special would be. To my pleasant surprise, it was really fun!

I'll admit that the trailers didn't look promising: including Santa Claus with your characters never seems like a good start, but damned if they didn't find a way to make it work, and work really well! It made sense, and it was funny.

The whole episode was funny, and scary, and witty, and clever ... basically, everything I've learned to expect from Steven Moffat but was disappointed not to receive from this last season. Well, he's back, and let's hope this means that Season 9 will be just as strong so we can just forget about Season 8 and move on. ""Nothing to see here, folks.""",1419811200,,961,4.543352601156069

I like Capaldi as Doctor, but I have been over Clara for awhile now. I won't spoil, but I do wish the bit just before the end had proven true. She's a little too Mary Sue/Manic Pixie Dream Girl for me with absolutely no substance. I loved seeing Danny again. Am I the only one who thinks Danny would have made a better companion? Then again, I keep holding out hope for a POC or woman Doctor, and we have it straight from the horse's mouth that the latter (at least) will not happen. Boys need to have their heroes or something like that. I guess girls only get to have sidekicks for heroes. Anyway, I want the stories to revolve more around the Doctor than his companions.

While ""Last Christmas"" doesn't do anything overtly to explain said plot points, it definitely makes room for something more to be done with them. It's also an excellent episode in its own right, being in my top three Doctor Who Christmas specials, the others being ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Snowmen."" A great mix of horror, fantasy, science-fiction, and Doctor Who humor, this episode was just what the doctor ordered for me, after the good, but depressing, Series 8 finale.

6867733,5,B00QGQFOHG,"Opinion regarding Clara as a companion seems deeply divided however I rather like her role as Doctor Who's moral compass. Indeed the relationship between the two seems believable to me - the Doctor clearly likes having her around and Clara is a TARDIS and Doctor Who junkie. Anyhow, regardless of whether you like her or not, this is a great Christmas special - integrating a Santa Claus theme with a decent storyline which is surely what you expect from a Christmas special?

The only question left open (to me at least) is where did the dream crabs come from and why did they attack the specific individuals in the story?

Peter Capaldi is a talented actor who is able to channel aspect of previous Doctors (especially Tom Baker) with ease. As such he is the most interesting Doctor we've had for quite a while.

This episode borders on the same level of frightening that was the Weeping Angels episode, and it does beg the Matrix-question, ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real?""  The writers did a wonderful job incorporating Santa Claus from the outset leading you to believe in Santa Claus.  The suggestion of the villain in this episode is just a potent as that of the Weeping Angels, in that there's no guaranteed way of proving that it's not true.",1419638400,,491,4.764705882352941

I loved Nick Frost as a curmudgeonly Santa Claus.  However, the plot doesn't make sense.  Did they rewrite the ending because Jenna Coleman is staying on?",1419638400,6,313,4.344827586206897

6867748,5,B00QGQFOHG,"The Last Christmas is the latest Dr Who Christmas special and, in my opinion, it is the best. I do not say that lightly but seldom has a Christmas show combined a compelling, a rather gritty sci fi story with one infused with the magic of Christmas so effectively.

The story jumps right into the action. Clara Oswald is awoken on Christmas Eve by a crash on the roof. Being Clara, she goes to investigate and finds a crashed sleigh, spilled toys, two bickering elves, reindeer running free in the skies and a guy in a red suit who claims to be a roof person doing roof things. Yes, Santa had a fender bender and soon gives up the pretense; he is Santa Claus. Clara, who is now days a rather forlorn young woman, having lost tragically lost both her boyfriend and her special best friend, is having none of it and has been 'an unbeliever since the age of nine', according to Santa.

If the scene could get any more surreal, the Tardis arrives in the falling snow.

The Doctor comes out, urgently orders Clara into the Tardis. (The fact that she goes without arguing is a telling point about her emotional state.) Being the Twelfth, this Doctor immediately warns Santa off; they have a enigmatic exchange and the Doctor departs, wishing Santa 'Happy Easter', to the admiration of the wise cracking elves.

And this is just the opening sequence.

The story peels back many layers of reality but I never had the confusion I've experienced on some previous Dr Who episodes, zipping back and forth along the timeline. It is a masterful mix of suspense, grim danger and Christmas joy, but not too intense for the kids, in my opinion.

I do appreciate the writing when every little thing can make a difference, or just taking the extra care of tying up a loose end. Steven Moffat excels at this on the Last Christmas. I didn't catch it the first viewing but even how Santa ended up with a dream crab in a specimen container is explained if you watch carefully enough. Perhaps not a big deal to the casual viewer, but I just like these extra touches.

There are a whole lot of things to like in this one. The Doctor and Santa are a hoot, trading insults to the delight of the elves, who seem to relish a good jab. Santa even imitates the Doctor's voice and does it well.

Danny Pink gets a proper farewell; a moving bit with Clara seemingly deciding to stay in the dream time with him. The Doctor shows up to take her back and even though they will never like each other, Danny and the Doctor seem to find mutual respect at last.

The central core of any Dr Who story is the Doctor - companion relationship, and these two are just getting stronger and better every time. Clara is still clearly grieving for Danny and, the Doctor, innocently this time, walks right into the heart of her anger. But overall, Clara is clearly delighted that he is back and, in turn, we finally see just how much Clara means to the Doctor in an extremely moving scene about how he perceives her.

Oh, and we also find out that even two thousand year old Time Lords love sleigh rides.

The acting is great. I think, after a couple of rough spots in his first year, Peter Capaldi is really hitting his stride as the Doctor. There is a lot of bark and some real bite to his Doctor. He will never wear his hearts on his sleeve as his two predecessors did, but he does care (especially for Clara) and he does fight the monsters. His Doctor is very deep and yes, can be somewhat dark, but he is a fascinating character to watch.  (And he delivers some great insults!)

Jenna Coleman is outstanding as an emotionally very fragile Clara, She conveys all the conflicting emotions. Grief, sadness and a wistful joy about being reunited with the Doctor. As ever, she does a good job of keeping the unruly Doctor in line, telling him to 'behave.' But there also comes across by subtle hints Clara is still haunted by the fear she will lose him again in this altered state of reality as she did in real life.
(I am delighted that Jenna Coleman is coming back as Clara. She and Capaldi are outstanding together. For this long time Who viewer, they are already near the top of my list for favorite Doctor - companion teams.)

Nick Frost is wonderful as Santa with an edge, as are Nathan McMullan and Who vet Dan Starkey as the elves. The artic base scientists are also well done. I regret I didn't get their names, other than Michael Troughton, son of the Second Doctor.  I did like the rather goofy Shonna, the 'gobie one' as the Doctor calls her.

I highly recommend this episode. I watched it with friends who are only casual Dr Who viewers at best and they loved it.",1419638400,55,4626,4.424705882352941
6867749,5,B00QGQFOHG,"I love everything about this new season, and the Christmas episode did not disappoint! I thought I wouldn't like an older DR, but Capaldi has changed my mind.",1419638400,,158,4.678571428571429

6867752,3,B00QGQFOHG,"Season 8 had had its moments but had been ultimately very disappointing. This episode was funny and Nick Frost shines as Santa Claus, however the plot is basically Inception (only with Santa and face hugging aliens). I know I'm not in the majority here but while I absolutely LOVE Capaldi as the doctor, Clara has overstayed her welcome. I was truly hoping this episode would be her last. We need a new companion. The writers for the last several seasons haven't been able to figure out what to do with Clara as a character and her departure is long overdue. This episode offers a heartwarming exit for her character only for the writers to take it back at the last minute. It comes across as the writers not being able to just let go, so they'll drag out her exit for as long as possible.

All in all I love doctor who, I enjoy Peter Capaldi as the doctor, but season 8 was lackluster at best and the Christmas special just fell short.",1419552000,39,936,4.410404624277457
6867753,5,B00QGQFOHG,"This is probably one of the most frightening and exciting Doctor Who Christmas specials ever. I'm not a big fan of Peter Capaldi's incarnation of the Doctor, but I have to admit Mr. Capaldi nailed it this go around. The nemesis this time was (is) more scary than weeping angels. With the angels, you could see them coming, these guys: well, how can you be really sure if they've got you or not?  Scary, sad with a touch of whimsy. One of the best Doctor Who episodes, Christmas or otherwise, ever.
It's a stand alone episode, but fits right in with the current story arc featuring the Clara Oswin Oswald companion. I await further adventures with baited breath.",1419552000,,661,4.601694915254237

Jenna and Peter do have a certain chemistry about them even if Clara does get on my nerves a bit sometimes. She keeps him honest and I guess the Doctor needs someone who isn't afraid to do that.
