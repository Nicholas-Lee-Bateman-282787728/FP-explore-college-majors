5509591,4,B00ATK0024,"I offer a litmus test.  If you adored Sylvain Chomet's ""Triplets of Belleville"" but were bored with ""The Illusionist"", this film won't work for you. Myself, I thought the colors and drawings were artistically incredible ...  something like Arabic or Hindu painted miniatures. Alas, there really is not much of a story.  It is instead a tale of a journey by a Sephardic rabbi, an Islamic musicologist,  and a Russian Jewish painter who are searching for a hidden Jerusalem in Ethiopia where Blacks and Jews co-exist in peace.  Along for the ride is the rabbi's ""talking cat"" - a creature which loves arguing and commenting on everything when he's not being pampered by the rabbi's voluptuous daughter. Since the rabbi is a religious man, they discuss differences in customs and spirituality and beliefs...and why that matters.

The half of the film that take place in Algiers, 1930 is simply stunning. Beautiful blue pools,  Persian carpets, exotic buildings, and mosaic tiles.  For that alone, I give it 4 stars. As well as the fabulous music!  The discussions between the characters were engaging but they did become didactic after a while.  One of the great moments is the decision by the cat to obtain a bar-mitzvah, and the objections of the orthodox community (in whatever land) to such an insanity.

The major problem of the movie is lack of a coherent narrative.  Perhaps that is life itself - lack of a coherent narrative  - form speaks substance.

I wish to highly recommend the extra - the autobiography of Joann Sfar - which is a fascinating exploration of how vision is reinterpreted into art.  For example, the voluptuous Rabbi's daughter in the animated film  (and the book upon which it is based) is based on the ""personality"" of the artist's grandmother, if not her looks.  How interesting. And the look of Algiers is shaped by the artist's memory of the colors of his birthplace on the French Riviera.  We learn that 100 per cent of the Jews of Nice are originally from Algeria.

This is animation for adults...worth a peek!",1358208000,21,2041,4.829971181556196

5509630,5,B00ATK0024,"I was hesitant about this film, I don't remember why though. Anyway, I  enjoyed this film so much that I watched it three times in a row!  The animation is odd in a compelling way. The storytelling is almost like 3 stories in one, which most would probably find odd,  but I can't help but love because each is so fascinating in it's own way. Whether it's the violence, the cultures, the philosophy or oddball characters that leave you with a WTF feeling most of the time, I enjoyed it immensely.",1455062400,2,495,4.417582417582418

5509642,5,B00ATK0024,"This is one of my favorite movies. It does not deserve any big awards, and it is not for everyone, but there is some thing just so special about it to both me and my wife. It is one of the few movies we have watched multiple times, and now that Netflix is no longer streaming it, I am buying the DVD (something I almost never do).

Yes, the plot (if you can call it that) really meanders about. It roughly breaks down into three separate stories, but even within those stories it is all over the place. In most cases, this would turn me off of a movie, but in this case it makes little difference to me, and perhaps it is part of why this movie works so well for me. The individual scenes are packed with ideas that are thoughtful and very entertaining.

I also love the visual style. I have seen it criticized as inconsistent, but again, I think it really works. The striking change in style towards the end is actually pretty key in its interpretation.",1449619200,,954,4.265193370165746
5509643,5,B00ATK0024,"One of my favorite movies. The artwork and soundtrack are entrancing, and I find myself viewing this film many times.  It is based on a series of graphic novels, and while much is lost in condensing the work to a feature film, much is also gained.

A few comments prompted by other reviews here:
 No, this is not a ""children's cartoon"".  It is smart and witty and layered and targeted to adults. Americans are still not used to this idea, but it is a well established, and wonderful, use of animation.  Likewise, the graphic novels are not ""comic books"", but are targeted toward intellegent adult readers. However, I would disagree with the notion that the movie is not suitable for children.  Perhaps not all children, but I think most enjoy intellegent and well crafted movies as much as anyone. There are scenes that are dark and deal with death and loss, and some violence and bloodshed, and, yes, even sexuality in the movie.  Some children may find this upsetting, but I suspect that it is the parents that will be more disturbed.  Parental discretion and all that.

Regarding the narrative structure: doesn't follow a coherent story arc, but rambles on from one adventure to the next.  This is, in part, a product of it being patched together from the adventures of several graphic novels, but it is also simply part of the story. Life rambles and, other than birth and death, has not begin get or end.  This is a story about life, about characters who are facing life, and examining life, sometimes in radically different ways. No morals or conclusions, that is left for the viewer to provide.  Some see this as a negative.  I think it is part of the brilliance of the film.

The books have been translated into English and I recommend them, as well as other graphic novels by Sfar

5509646,3,B00ATK0024,"The Rabbis Cat is about, well, a rabbi and a cat in North Africa. One day, when the cat eats a parrot, he suddenly starts talking. The scenery shows particularly extensive detailing and hatching in the linework. The artwork for the characters shows a somewhat rough cartooning style. The animation is decent. The story, though, is downright haphazard and unfocusedapparently it was taken from assorted story arcs from the original comic. The movie aims at a more genteel kind of comedy, but its actually kind of dulleven the parody of Tintin is a major missed opportunity. The good news is that there is a real theme of human unity and difference, well as the search for life under God, and a commentary on flawed relations among different people, as seen in the friendships and relations among the characters here.",1424736000,,815,4.870503597122302

I think I know what they were getting at, but I will get my friends to watch it for a second opinion"".

In short, if you are an animation fan this will satisfy as an example of how unique modern hand drawn animation is. Be sure to check out Persepolis, Chico and Rita, Secret of Kells, The Illusionist, Triplettes of Belleville, and other fine animated films not trying to sell anyone toys (not that there is anything wrong with that {he says holding his Totoro plush}).",1412812800,,763,4.45

Spirited Away. The animation is beautiful. Based on the graphic novel, Le Chat du Rabbin, this movie has it all- a Russian refugee who sneaks into Algeria in a crate filled with Russian prayer books, a road trip, and even a reference to The Adventures of Tin-tin. Oh, and, of course, a talking cat. But don't let the family-movie camouflage fool you; this is no kid's movie.

For an amazing adventure through French Africa, The Rabbi's Cat is the real deal. The only thing I found upsetting is the ending.
Nonetheless, I should read Le Chat du Rabbin II sometime. You must have a certain taste for a movie like this.",1398816000,4,809,4.618055555555555

5509689,3,B00ATK0024,"I was really looking forward to this newest release from the GKIDS company. The first animated film I got from them was the wonderful ""Chico and Rita"" - which I raved about when it played in theaters and then on BD. Next came the ""Tales of the Night"" which was much darker in image and storyline. This film has a bit of both with a nice sense of humor.

My fellow reviewer K. Harris has already told you much about the 89-minute film and the DVD so I won't repeat it but add some clarification.

This DVD, like Tales of the Night is in French with English subtitles. The problem - and it a big one, in my opinion, is that the font is not only smaller than most subtitles but they are in WHITE letters. Since many scenes have a white background, it is very often impossible to completely read the subtitles. I know I missed some great lines. Interestingly one of the two bonus features - ""Johan Sfar Draws From Memory"" (which is 43 minutes, long; not the "" just short of an hour"" described by K) uses YELLOW subtitles which are easy to read! The best subtitled films either place the subtitles below the images or use these bright yellow ones. I hope that GKIDS will consider this in the future. The other bonuses are the U.S. Trailer and a 24-minute ""Making of"" in French with WHITE subtitles - but a bit larger than the feature film.

So, I'd have given the film itself 5 stars for story and production but I have to deduct 2 stars for having to struggle through the small and hard to read subtitles. (This may not affect you as much  if you have a LARGE-SCREEN television).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5509690,5,B00ATK0024,"The Rabbi's Cat is a truly charming animated film. The story follows an elder Rabbi and his daughter living in the Sephardic Jewish community in pre-World War 2 Algeria. The eponymous cat develops the ability to speak upon devouring the Rabbi's prized Parrot and proceeds to cause no end of mischief for the family and the surrounding community.

For fans of the graphic novel by Sfar, the film stays absolutely loyal to the look, feel, and theme of the original. The film has cut some plot-lines and characters in order to fit within the standard length of a two hour movie, but this hurts the narrative much less than one might think.

The Rabbi's Cat is ultimately about identity, religion, and ethnicity and how the contradictions within those boundaries ultimately define us as people. The fim is targeted at adults with the religious and historical that are too complicated for younger children. Overall, a great film from beginning to end.",1366502400,,946,4.90625

I wish the Odyssey of Africa towards the end had been done as a stand-alone sequel. Oh well, it looks good and it has got more heart and imagination than most movies.
