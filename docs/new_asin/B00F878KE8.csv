5969475,4,B00F878KE8,"This film is great armchair travel, especially for anyone who loves food and wine and learning about the people who make the products they love.

5969476,5,B00F878KE8,"Watched it with friends - dinner and a movie. Beautiful - I mean really beautiful- great music too! It's a peek behind the curtain to see some of the most talented winemaker in the world. Awesome!

Figured out I needed to make sure my setting were set to run the cc for the subtitles- they are there! Perfect movie for family and friends.",1386201600,12,338,4.365079365079365

5969478,2,B00F878KE8,"Film is fine. Quality in picture and sound fine.
What isn't fine is Amazon's Unbox.
In addition to crippling DRM, Unbox doesn't support Closed Captions.
Half the documentary is in French. I can't enjoy the film short of learning the Language.",1384819200,6,242,4.926829268292683
5969479,3,B00F878KE8,Great documentary but THERE ARE NO FRENCH TRANSLATIONS FOR THE FRENCH LANGUAGE INTERVIEWS.  Very frustrating.  I understand some French but not enough to understand the technical language of wine production.,1383696000,13,207,5.866666666666666

5969505,4,B00F878KE8,If you're interested in wine and especially interested in Burgundy--then you'll like this movie.  It gives an inside view of a year in the life of winemaking in Burgundy and a bit about the Burgundian culture.  I really enjoyed it!,1476230400,,231,4.75
5969506,4,B00F878KE8,A great overview of the year in wine from a Bourgogne (Burgundy) perspective. This is one of the must see wine movies for every wine enthusiast. Best viewed with a Burgundy Grand Cru or Premier Cru Chard (or PN) ;-),1475971200,,215,4.4

5969521,5,B00F878KE8,I loved this film! Beautifully written and filmed.,1470700800,,50,5.375
5969522,4,B00F878KE8,"Wish I could spend a year in Burgundy!!

Having traveled in the Burgundy region and sampled the different wines on several occasions,
it brings back good memories. After a long day visiting vintners and sampling different varieties
a great treat would be spending a night or two in Dijon with its color tiled half timbered houses
and excellent restaurants.",1461542400,,356,5.033898305084746
5969523,5,B00F878KE8,"An excellent, informative and entertaining film.  It gave me an appreciation of the skill and tenacity required to produce such wonderful wines.  I also learned about the  wine growing history of the region and architecture.  I highly recommend watching it with a group of friends that share the passion for the nectar of the gods.",1461024000,,331,4.963636363636364
5969524,2,B00F878KE8,Poorly made film about a fascinating subject.  All over the place.  Just as you started to get interested in one aspect we switched without explanation to something different.  Really disappointed as I am really interested in this subject.,1452643200,,239,5.2368421052631575
5969525,3,B00F878KE8,"A decent documentary about wine-making in Burgundy. It is deprived of any true social or political content, which limits its scope and purpose. Informative but too cautious in its approach.",1446508800,,189,5.333333333333333
5969526,5,B00F878KE8,The film is beautifully made and puts a human face on the anonymous and intimidating bottles from Burgundy.  It has the feel of a victorious sports movie as the filmmaker follows the vines from first bud to harvest.,1440374400,,215,4.657894736842105
5969527,5,B00F878KE8,Extremely well done - loved it,1438387200,,30,4.166666666666667
5969548,4,B00F878KE8,Interesting movie.,1438128000,,18,8.5
5969549,5,B00F878KE8,A very interesting documentary describing the wine-making process in the region of Burgundy from A to Z.  Thoroughly enjoyable.,1434412800,,127,5.684210526315789
5969550,4,B00F878KE8,"Very fun movie, while at the same time serious. If you love French wine and history, this is a must watch. It only gives a glimpse, though, and makes me want to spend ten years in Burgundy.",1434326400,,189,4.135135135135135
5969551,3,B00F878KE8,"A bit slow moving, but quite informative regarding to making wine - we enjoy wine!",1433721600,,82,4.533333333333333
5969552,5,B00F878KE8,I love this documentary. I first saw it on Netflix and immediately searched Amazon for a DVD because I wanted my own copy. There's something so serene and life affirming about the people in burgundy whose lives revolve around growing the grape and producing wine. A must-see for anyone who loves good wine.,1433721600,,306,4.7924528301886795
5969553,5,B00F878KE8,a good video to see the other world.  I liked it.,1433462400,,49,3.4545454545454546
5969554,5,B00F878KE8,"I loved this DVD enough that I checked it out of the library twice, and had to have it.  Following the seasons was a good way to tell the story of a the wine grape that I love best, in its most perfect home. If I were to wish for perfection in a Burgundy documentary, I would like to see more thorough coverage of more wine makers, since the ""infinite variery"" of Burgundy wines is something that attracts me to them. This video is not that. Rather, it is a personal tour with wine importer Martine Saunier, who knows Burgundy well and generously introduces us to the winemakers whom she knows and loves best.  Magnifique!",1432598400,,622,4.4
5969555,5,B00F878KE8,Cool documentary. It's not a documentary that keeps you on the edge of your seat but definitely interesting and easy to watch. My wife and I watched it in two parts since it is a bit long. We both enjoy wine and this was an enjoyable way to learn more about what all is involved in the wine-making process and the passion that winemakers in Burgundy have for what they do.,1429574400,,372,4.253521126760563
5969556,4,B00F878KE8,"Very interesting and inspiring for people like me who works professionally with wine, being a Sommelier and teaching both in a Chef School (""Cake and Bake"" in Guadalajara) and a couple of Universities in the same City (Universidad Autonoma de Gudalajara and Unico: Universidad para la Comunidad) in which I teach in the Schools of Nutrition and Gastronomy. I just wish there were subtitles in Spanish so I could use as teaching support!",1426377600,,436,4.986301369863014
5969557,5,B00F878KE8,Very good,1422921600,,9,4.0
5969558,5,B00F878KE8,"Outstanding!! The subjects, winemakers, hardwork, filming, passion and the love of family & wine really comes through! this is more than just a movie about wine making - it's about life and the passion of putting thier love in a bottle. My wife and I truly enjoyed this film.",1421193600,,275,4.63265306122449
5969559,5,B00F878KE8,"i have made the pilgrimage to the cote d'or several times, and this documentary made me want to take the next plane to france.

no narrator was listed, but my wife and i (both fans of the 'all creatures' films) could swear it was peter davison (tristan farnon)

as to subtitles, our tv automatically displayed them when we turned on our closed-captioning feature.",1420588800,,363,4.746031746031746
5969560,5,B00F878KE8,Another great movie.  Recommended by our favorite wine manager at Parkers Light House!,1420243200,,86,5.615384615384615
5969561,4,B00F878KE8,"Interesting close-up of Burgandy wine-making and community.  Fairly basic old-school production techniques, much subtitled dialog, but  these give a sense of authenticity.  Recommend to the serious wine-lover that enjoys the wines' narratives almost as much as the wine itself.",1419206400,,277,6.051282051282051
5969562,3,B00F878KE8,"This is a ""watchable"" brief documentary on Burgundy wine-making from the point of view of one wine critic / distributor. It is not a tutorial on making burgundy, nor a documentary of different approaches, nor an encyclopedia of viticulture.  The wine cellars represented seem to be long-time friends / suppliers of the narrator.

It wasn't a bad way to spend an hour and a half but at the end I was not surprised, charmed, or particularly enlightened.",1416787200,,451,4.8441558441558445
5969563,5,B00F878KE8,"This is the best wine film I have seen. It was fascinating and exciting while educational and cultural. The piano music is so relaxing as you venture through the vineyards, labs, and cellars of various Burgundy wineries. There is a lot of French language, but don't worry it is all captioned.",1410652800,,292,4.745098039215686
5969564,5,B00F878KE8,"Along with Somm, this is one of the more interesting wine films to come along in a while.  It's not as hokey as I found Bottle Shock to be.  This is really an inside look into family wine growing operations in Burgundy and the dedication and inspiration that goes into making their wine.  A must view for wine lovers, especially French wine fans",1410480000,,345,4.444444444444445
5969565,4,B00F878KE8,"Wonderful insights into wine cultivation, wine making and the celebration of drinking it.",1410393600,,89,5.923076923076923
5969566,5,B00F878KE8,"I know a lot of folks are complaining about the lack of subtitles, but it is the playing device that people are using that is not properly displaying the subtitles - they work fine while playing this on my PS3.

Basically this short documentary takes the viewer through a year in Burgundy with a few winemakers.  It isn't as controversial as Mondovino - nobody is subtly mocking Rolland or Suckling or Micheal Mondavi in this one.  Instead we see what some of the small Burgundy producers must put up with throughout a year in the region.  From tense nerves when rain approaches or frayed nerves when the police show up to inspect everyone's work permits - all the fun and headache of a year in Burgundy are represented.

Again, this is a documentary that cannot possibly show everything that happens in a year in Burgundy, but it gives one an insight to the life and times of some of the growers as seen through the viewpoint of a small importer/exporter.

Highly recommended for my fellow oenophiles!",1409270400,7,1002,4.6647727272727275
5969567,4,B00F878KE8,I admit that I bought this because of David Kennard being connected with it expecting something else. This is an excellent film which shows the activities of a wine producing area over a course of a year. The photography is excellent and should be interesting to anyone interested in people in other places whether you are into wine or not.,1406246400,,340,4.683333333333334
5969588,5,B00F878KE8,"If you are a fan of wine, this film is for you. Various vintners are visited, each with their own style of wine making and all successful at their craft. Kennard skillfully compares and contrast the winemakers and interweaves the inherent difficulties weather imposes on the agricultural process.",1406073600,3,296,5.1875
5969589,5,B00F878KE8,"This film is about some of the most inaccessible wine that the world has to offer, yet shows you that the people producing it are in fact down to earth farmers.",1403136000,2,160,4.193548387096774
5969590,5,B00F878KE8,"This film works very well because the makers had good access to interesting Domaines in
Burgundy . It is measured and easy to watch.
I am a lover of Burgundy wine and have visited the area several times ; but the full access to
activities in  each season of the year gives more than an understanding of the vineyards; it shows the
passion and understanding that the people have for their land and vines.
Observing the action at Domaine Leroy and the comments and approach of Mme Lalou is a special privilege
not often granted.",1402790400,6,526,4.536842105263158
5969591,5,B00F878KE8,"Read a review in Wine Spectator of this movie and immediately went to Amazon. Pre-ordered it and got it upon release. Taking place in France and the French countryside you could not ask for a better backdrop. All those in the movie are in the business, the grape pickers, the cooks that feed them during harvest, the winemakers and owners.

Worth the price. I have watched several times and will watch many more.",1401148800,,412,4.6438356164383565
5969592,5,B00F878KE8,Loved everything about this film. The music alone is worth the price of admission. Add the lush cinematography and the fascinating winegrowers and you have a wonderful couple of hours of fun and learning.,1401148800,,204,5.029411764705882
5969593,4,B00F878KE8,Well done observational study of the Burgundy region in France and the winemakers who live there.  An enjoyable tour of life on the vine.,1400803200,,137,4.708333333333333
5969594,1,B00F878KE8,"Tried this on three devices, including amazon fire tv, mac mini, and ipad, NONE worked. I spent five bucks on nothing.",1397174400,,118,4.666666666666667
5969595,4,B00F878KE8,"I enjoyed this documentary very much - it just went on a little too long in the end!

Would recommend seeing it though  to see the passion and work that goes into producing these Burgundies and why they command premium prices.",1395014400,,226,4.487804878048781
5969596,5,B00F878KE8,A very nice short film documenting a year in the growing season in Burgundy following Martine Sanier. It's worth a look.,1393804800,,120,4.761904761904762
5969597,4,B00F878KE8,"Beautiful scenery, dedicated wine lovers, and the story of a very impressive business woman make this an interesting and worthwhile video.  Beware -- you'll want to get on the next plane heading to France to find those picturesque places and drink that delicious wine!",1393200000,,268,5.090909090909091
5969618,5,B00F878KE8,"Gorgeous images, beautiful music, plus an inside view of wine making. The perfect giftall my friends are receiving it! Lolly Anderson",1393200000,,133,5.380952380952381
5969619,5,B00F878KE8,"For the wine lover this film provides a wonderful insight into the history, passion and beauty of wine making in Burgundy",1391990400,,121,4.809523809523809
5969620,5,B00F878KE8,"Wonderful movie, well done, and beautiful scenery. However, you should be interested in the whole wine process or it could be a bit slow.",1391385600,,137,4.75
5969621,2,B00F878KE8,The movie is at least half in French with no subtitles. Would not have ordered it if I had known this.,1390176000,2,102,3.9047619047619047
5969622,4,B00F878KE8,"I'm biased: everything about Burgundy, from the reds and whites to the geography to the quality of light to the down-to-earth winemakers, is understated but fine. This film captures all of them, with great cinematography, Satie-subtle piano score, and the simple four-seasons structure. Even if, like me, you can't afford a ""grand cru,"" and rarely a ""premier,"" you'll enjoy seeing the passion and meticulousness of those who produce them.",1389571200,,438,5.36231884057971
5969623,1,B00F878KE8,"Unless you understand spoken French, you will not understand about half of this movie. The other half was good, but the French half was unintelligible to me.",1389571200,6,157,4.851851851851852
5969624,5,B00F878KE8,"What a treat to go into the cellars and vineyards of several vintners in Burgundy regions of France and see how the culture and terrior determine the lifestyles.  Martine is a sweet elderly host for this journey but grapes and those who tend them are the real stars of the show.  Another great treat that most of us will never experience is the annual wine dinner/festival at Clos Vougeot where 500 locals and guests celebrate the wonders of wines from the Burgundy region.  This can be a wonderful way to learn about wines and vines as well but you must be observant about the subtleties of information that the locals take for granted and those who are not familiar often miss.  For example, the emphasis on the two primary grapes of burgundy, chardonnay and pinot noir get lost for many people in all the French names and unique labels.  All burgundy serious wines that are red are pinot noirs.  There is another haunting feature of this film that involves the musical scores.  One of the young winemaker heirs, Thibaut, loves to play the piano and it seems like they have used his hobby as the simplistic background music for painting the simple French countryside and it is more authentic than the producers expected.  This is a wonderful movie if you are looking for relief from all the ""R"" rated junk that fills the theaters.  A Year In Burgundy still makes me want to return some September in my work clothes and see if I could get hired to pick the grapes.  I may not be the fastest worker but I would be meticulous and for sure I would never be late to lunch or dinner!",1389052800,8,1579,4.508771929824562
5969625,3,B00F878KE8,A good portion of the movie is spoken in French with no subtitles. The biggest bummer is that they spoke with a lot of winery owners and winemakers and you have no idea what they are saying unless you speak French. With subtitles this movie would have easily gotten another star from me. Hopefully this is something they will work on????,1388793600,,337,4.540983606557377
5969626,1,B00F878KE8,"Complete waste of money (actually I consider it stolen).  Can't stream or download.
Tried Mac, virtual PC and amazon's iPad app.  None worked.
Lesson I learned, skip this film and anything else film buff studios might post.",1387497600,2,223,5.0
5969627,5,B00F878KE8,It was a subject that I am passionate about and I felt like I had experienced a year in burgundy in the vineyards.,1386892800,3,114,4.0
8612937,5,B00F878KE8,"I bought it after reading about it in the Wall Street Journal, and enjoyed it on several levels-- interesting for wine lovers, but also interesting views of Burgundy, including Clos Vougeot.",1522540800,,190,5.161290322580645
8612938,5,B00F878KE8,What a teasure!!!  This is fantastique.  I met Martine a few years ago at the International Pinot Noir Celebration.  She's such a grand and classy lady.  This documentary is so fun and informative.  I was smiling the entire time watching it.  And then I came out of m chair when the film shifted to Blackberry Farm in Tennessee ( I now live in Nashville).  That was such a cool segway.  I will watch this many times.  I can't believe it has taken me this long to find it. Go Martine!,1516752000,,483,4.277777777777778
8612939,5,B00F878KE8,"What a find. I love Burgundy, For me this wonderful film is the holy grail of finds, Tomorrow, I will pull out my last 2005 Vosne Romanee and together we shall watch again the holy grail...!",1512777600,,190,4.305555555555555

8612941,5,B00F878KE8,"I love this movie and have watched it many times.  Very inspiring to see how some of the best wines are made and that many different styles can still result in compelling wines.  As well, profiling some of the very interesting characters in Burgundy is insightful - what I wouldn't give to spend a day or two with Lalou as her passion for her vines seems unparalleled.  Well worth a view and maybe many depending on how much you care for how wine is made, from vineyard to bottle to glass!",1498867200,2,489,4.351648351648351
8612942,5,B00F878KE8,Superb documentary which helps us understand why a bottle of fermented grape juice can cost so much.,1492732800,2,100,4.9411764705882355

8612946,5,B00F878KE8,"This is a beautifully filmed and well-produced view of the complexities of the wines of Burgundy. It does a very good job of illustrating and explaining the ancient methods of an exceedingly provincial wine region, capturing the strong sense of tradition and pride that still persists.",1483833600,3,285,5.217391304347826
