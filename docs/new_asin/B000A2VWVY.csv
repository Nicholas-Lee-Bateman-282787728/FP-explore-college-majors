8073218,5,B000A2VWVY,Good movie! An intriguing suspense thriller. Good sets with wonderful film noir lighting. Gorgeous black and white like they used to make!,1427414400,,138,5.318181818181818
8073219,2,B000A2VWVY,"This is a crap movie, but I still love Shu qi. The storyline, such as it is, is convoluted and contradictory. The only reason I purchased it was to watch shu qi perform. She Rulz, smart, sweet, beautiful; but there is no ther reason to watch this terrible example of Chinese cinema. ( I feel better writing that previous sentence, just knowing that Shu qi is from Taiwan.) If you really, really must watch a Shu qi, or any chinese film, check out If You are the one& If you are the one II love and marriage. They are truely great films and to get your shu Qi fix,  you even get rewarded with an enjoyable movie. And yes, Ge You Rulz too. I haven't seen him in anything else yet. But he is charming and sweet and damn it I fell in love with his Character Qin Fen in these movies (No, not in that way. Get your mind out of the gutter and enjoy a movie with engaging characters and a solid story. You can thank me Later.",1412121600,,917,4.094444444444444

8073221,5,B000A2VWVY,I thought the movie was good and it has it slow parts too. The movie plays like a mystery and makes you guess what may happen to one of the two twin sisters played by the ever alluring Shu Qi. She did a great job of playing the two roles and the acting was good. The little back drop into the Peking Opera and how it was done was a plus in the movie. Any Shu Qi fans would enjoy this movie and find something that touches them in some small way as it has with me. The last movie I have seen her play more than one role was in For Bad Boys Only where she had multiple roles. That one was more action/sci-fi fantasy.,1405728000,,614,3.880952380952381
8073222,4,B000A2VWVY,"Borrowing heavily from Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense may have returned the compliment after he saw 1949s noir murder mystery called The Second Woman.

Director James V. Kern retreads Rebecca and Manderlay with his story of a dead wife-to-be and the architect owner of a Falling Water lookalike called Hilltop. Robert Young gives an accounting as a paranoid antihero with a Frank Lloyd Wright talent.

Jeff (Young) could be unlucky when his bride, his dog, his horse, expensive sculptures and paintings, all become targets of villainy. Whether it is his self-created plot, or someone elses, this little gem must show in ninety taut minutes.

The house on the Costa del Rey in California on the Big Sur mimics scenes that Hitchcock would use in Vertigo nearly ten years later. The movie even borrows the dotty Florence Bates (a standard Hitchcock matron) for added atmosphere and homage to the Master.

There are enough suspicious people around Robert Youngs character to make anyone paranoid, but he is blessed with Betsy Drake as Ellen, niece of his next-door-neighbor, visiting and sleuthing using her literal actuarial tables for detecting. Yes, there is a spunky female willing to risk all to solve the mystery.

With snatches of melody from a variety of Tchaikovsky symphonies, the subtle elegance and atmospheric sets are a delight to behold.

This low-rent studio production rises up from its humble roots and provides first-class entertainment. Forgotten for decades, the film deserves to be rescued from its dismissal as something slightly borrowed from the A-list films of 1949.

Viewers plucky enough to seek the film out are in for a treat. Available from Amazon Instant Video and Sinister Cinema. And be sure to read ALFRED HITCHCOCK FRESHLY SHOWERED, on Amazon for smart readers.",1398384000,,1796,5.151202749140894
8073223,5,B000A2VWVY,"I really like this movie and that is not just because of the noir, gothic, aspect and the quircky portrait of California and it's history, but to have a movie released in 1949 in which the most intelligent, independent, discernment, resolve, character is actually a WOMAN!!! it is just remarkable... way ahead of her time, Ellen Foster lives in a world dominated by men, she is move by facts, reason and statistics not superstition; she is so independent that she completely ignores the orders of her love interest(Jeff CoHalan) to ""stay away from his affairs"" and basically resolves the hole mistery on her own... it's fun to watch goodie two shoes, very pretty, Ellen get hit on really aggressively and called a ""helpless woman"" in this window in to the 1950's society and yet come out on top... way ahead of her time you go Ellen (Betsy Drake)...",1381017600,,849,4.743243243243243
8073224,4,B000A2VWVY,"The Second Woman, 1951 film

The story begins with a view of a house near the ocean. A man enters and warns two women of the man in their house, who they find in a garage with the motor running. They rescue him. The story now goes back in time when Ellen Foster first met Jeff Cohalon. She visits his modern house with huge windows. Ellen learns about Jeff's bad luck. Later Ellen visits Jeff, who doesn't know how his horse broke a leg. Was there a man in those bushes? Ellen is a CPA and actuary for an insurance company. [Hints are dropped about Jeff's mental status.] Ellen, at home, hears a dog howling. What happened? ""There's always a reason for everything."" There is a pattern to the accidents. Ellen wants to investigate these accidents but Jeff objects. The next accident is a fire at Jeff's home that destroys it. Next Jeff's firm loses a contract to design a new hospital because of missing details.

Doctor Hartley calls Ellen about Aunt Amelia, and warns her to get their houseguest to move away. He is paranoiac with delusions about persecution, and can become dangerous at any moment. He explains about the accidents. On her way home Ellen is nearly hit by a speeding car. Ellen tells this to Jeff, he advises her to leave the house. ""Don't trust anybody."" But Ellen confides in Jeff. At night she hears footsteps and sees Jeff going to the garage. Why is he siphoning gas from his car? Afterwards Jeff climbs the stairs to Ellen's room. He draws a small pistol from his pocket, and gives it to Ellen. ""Don't be afraid to use it."" Then the opening scene is repeated, Jeff is rescued and sent to the hospital. Ellen visits Jeff in the hospital for a conversation that explains what Jeff did. ""Why did you do it?"" Jeff explains the reasons for his actions: someone is attacking him. Jeff cautions Ellen. Now he searches for Vincente Torres, who painted a portrait of a lady with a guitar. [Suspicious?]

There is a conversation between Jeff and Ben. Jeff has investigated and found who bought that watercolor portrait. It ties together the known facts. [This is a big surprise!] Then Ellen bursts in with two men, and we get another big surprise! This explains the mystery about the death of Jeff's first wife. Ben is shocked by this news, and tells a secret about Vivian's mother. There is action, and Dr. Hartley is called. ""Everything is going to be alright."" ""The catharsis began when Ellen called Fall River"" said Dr. Hartley. Ellen explains how she looked up the accident report to find the facts. There will be a happy ending now.

This story starts slowly, the drama occurs at the end. It plays with the viewer in presenting a story that is reversed at the end. A warning about making assumptions? Is there a problem is having a person diagnosed and judged by gossip or second-hand opinion? Overall, about average for a low-budget movie. The scenes echo some other movies of that era (""Spellbound""?). One lesson is: don't trust an authority figure. Even paranoids have real enemies.",1294012800,,3004,4.640977443609023
8073225,5,B000A2VWVY,"This atmospheric mystery has almost a gothic feel, the stark black and white photography of Hal Mohr meshing nicely with Tschaikousky's music to create a sustained mood throughout. Produced by Mort Briskin in conjunction with Robert Smith, who also wrote the story, it gradually pulls the viewer in deeper and deeper until completely immersed in the happenings.

A mysterious mood is set from the very beginning with shots of a house called Hilltop overlooking the California coastline. Betsy Drake's voiceover reveals in flashback the reason a simple knock on her door instills fear. Robert Young is the architect named Jeff who meets and charms Betsy Drake's Ellen Foster on a train bound for Pine Cliff. It is where he built Hilltop for a bride we discover died in a tragic car accident the day before their marriage. He has not been the same since, Dr. Hartley (Morris Carnovsky) stating his concern for his intermittent bouts of depression.

Ellen is a sweet girl who falls for Jeff during his more charming moments and is sympathetic to his darker moods. Ben Shepard (Henry O'Neill) is the would-have-been father-in-law he has remained close to, and Keith (John Sutton) is the slimy playboy lusting after Jeff's newfound love. An atmosphere of impending doom hangs over the couple's romance, and as misfortune begins to pile up on Jeff, Ellen suspects he is being given the gaslight treatment. Since he is obviously keeping a secret, it is unclear what is really going on, keeping the viewer guessing.

Drake is very likable as the CPA standing by Jeff even as he pushes her away. She knows a fading painting, a dying bush, and a wounded horse are a statistical improbability, Jeff's rotten luck a little too bad to be true. But when helping him puts her in danger, he hatches a dangerous plan to get at the truth. There is an earthy realism to their romance, a maturity that seems fresh for this time period. What it lacks in excitement it makes up for in psychological drama and atmosphere. Director James V. Kern's film may be less heralded than others made earlier in the cycle, but makes a nice one for a Saturday morning or late at night. Robert Young and Betsy Drake make a nice couple in a forgotten little gem which deserves a second look.",1288224000,3,2254,4.774358974358974
