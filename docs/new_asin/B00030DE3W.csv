It again arrived before the expected date and played well.

Yep I will be buying from them again",1315008000,,164,4.258064516129032
2155451,4,B00030DE3W,"Don Rickles, always does it for me on all the roasts.  Redd Foxx is just an icon, and Carroll O'Connor's was great too. It just saddens me, that so many are gone, but, that's what's good about finding old gems, like these roasts.",1312243200,,229,4.325581395348837
2155452,4,B00030DE3W,"Wow,just legends everywhere. The roasts of today, are just nasty, and the people they honor don't even deserve it. Sammy Davis,was just pure class, and the people seemed to sincerely respect one another.",1312243200,,203,5.181818181818182
2155453,1,B00030DE3W,"This is television at it's best. Many of the funniest stars of that time, roasting one another. The problem is, the whole set sells for $999. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2726?&tag=shopwiki-us-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325). 27 DVD's and even when purchased individually are $20 a piece + S&H. Why couldn't this have been sold by season with multiple discs at a more reasonable price when compared to other classic TV Shows releases. Classic Television, but a classic rip-off!",1283644800,13,497,6.114285714285714

2155456,5,B00030DE3W,"We loved the Dean Martin Roasts when they originally aired. Its too bad DVD or VHS Recorders were not around then we could of recorded them ourselves and would of been able to hear the dialog better.

The audio on this one was bad.

Still funny, and great seeing all the old time stars who are nolonger with us.",1258070400,2,311,4.254237288135593

2155458,5,B00030DE3W,"I always enjoy these roasts and have watched them over and over again. Some parts, like Ruth Buzzi, I just fast forward thru as I never really cared for that character she plays.",1380153600,,178,4.424242424242424
2155459,5,B00030DE3W,We never get tired of watching the celebrity roasts. You see so many of the old legends in these tapes. Carroll O'Connor and Redd Foxx are two very funny men and it was a pleasure to see all the other stars all together.,1377216000,,220,4.1395348837209305

2155462,5,B00030DE3W,I just finished watching Dean Martin celebrity roast saluting Dean along with many of my favorite stars. I never realized John Wayne could be so funny.

2155464,4,B00030DE3W,"This video was very entertaining. It felt like visiting old friends. I highly recommend it. I could hear it all even given a laugh track that could be a little lower or nonexistent.. I felt that the Roast of Sammy Davis was a lot funnier than that of Jackie Gleason - if not for that, I would have rated it a 5 star.",1359504000,,316,4.031746031746032
2155465,5,B00030DE3W,"This one will bring back happy memories of long-gone TV stars , such as Jackie Gleason, Sammy Davis and, of course, the Deano himself.  This is a laugh riot that you will have to see from beginning to end. Nothing on today's TV to compete with these TV giants. Arrived on time and securely packaged",1336521600,,298,4.418181818181818
2155466,1,B00030DE3W,"The picture is wavy and the sound is distorted.  Since the cost was only $5.72, it
is not worth returning.",1327104000,,106,4.3

8035682,5,B00030DE3W,"Just because it's classic don't let that fool you; this is the funniest stuff ever produced and some of it is shockingly crude. It's nothing too obscene like modern comedy.  If you like your laughs more wholesome but not TOO wholesome, this fits your description of good comedy.",1392336000,,278,4.791666666666667
