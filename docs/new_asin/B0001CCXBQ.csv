gloria has been a isprashion to me because when i listion to her sing it make the world around me stop and only i can here gloria i love here for about my hole life she is the greatest",1102636800,,286,3.6885245901639343
1986637,3,B0001CCXBQ,"Y'know, Gloria, I just love ya to death but sometimes you need to break a sweat. This is not Ms. Estefan's best work. The music is fabulous and flawless, especially the new numbers, ""Te Amare"" in particular - a new Estefan classic which you won't be able to get out of your head, worth the price of the disc alone. The band as usual is brilliant, the songs are addictive, you can't help but move as you listen. But Dearest Gloria, I feel used and abused! Where's the passion? Where's the movement? Where's the funk? Why so antiseptic? GET OUT OF VEGAS! I don't expect you to do gymnastics but you move as though the audience is taking up your time! Just because you're surrounded by great, gorgeous dancers who really DO deliver the goods doesn't mean you get to perform at half speed. But let me get back to the positive - the music makes up for everything. Well, except the big plastic alligator and the toy poodle and the wacky housewife and the cheap flamingoes.... C'mon Gloria, you're MUCH better than this.",1090540800,5,1013,4.510869565217392
1986638,2,B0001CCXBQ,"OK so I am comparing this to the latest Cher DVD when I make the above comment ..... Now there is a concert DVD that was a faboulous presentnation and technically stupendous ...
Appart from the actual DVD being a technical diaster  ... and as other reviewers noted the concert DVD  lacked any other footage besides the concert ... I couldn't believe that they actaully made this DVD in Las Vegas ... what is with that .. They rolling stones taled Vooodoo Lounge in Miami and Gloria Estefan her concert in Las Vegas .... gimme abreak ....
The audience was great but certianly subdued and that of course reflected on the concert ... It actually helped make the silk pink flamingos  appear cheesy ... and I mean real cheesy!
This was OBVIOUSLY a concert made with a limited budget .. limited expectations ...and I would venture to guess limited sales .... sorry ......",1090195200,2,865,4.640522875816994
1986639,4,B0001CCXBQ,"I tell ya, we are lucky aren't we. If you are a Gloria fan, then you certainly haven't being short changed in the DVD department.
Another Gloria concert for the collection. This one is beautiful.
Great stage, tons of musicians and a great campy Miami finale, which I loved.
If you want to see a great concert DVD then this is for you. With a few songs from her new album and a lots from her back catalogue, it all adds up to a great show and one you will remember always.
Highly recommended. Enjoy",1078358400,11,497,4.242105263157895
1986640,4,B0001CCXBQ,"Gloria Estefan is explosive, and this DVD proves it.  Backed by a brilliant 23-piece band, a troupe of dancers and awe-inspiring set designs, Estefan presents hits old and new in this infectious concert event.  Though her vocals sometimes sound a bit strained, Estefan is all energy and has a commanding stage presence.  Her charisma, humor and warmth are captivating, and she manages to make a 4,000 seat theater seem as intimate as a street-corner lounge.  New arrangements of classics such as ""1,2,3"", ""Turn The Beat Around"", ""Oye Mi Canto"" and a beautful ballad medley are sure to delight, while Latin staples such as ""Mi Tierra"", ""Con Los Anos..."", and ""Hoy"" showcase the singer's passion for her heritage.  Also included are songs from her most recent album, the intimate ""Unwrapped"".  Of these, ""Te Amare"" is the standout, while Estefan also delivers a powerful rendition of ""I Wish You"" to close out the show after performing a spectacle of an encore, complete with alligator, flamingos and palm trees.  Caliente!",1077753600,6,1021,5.077844311377246
1986641,5,B0001CCXBQ,"Unfortunately I couldn't make it to the ""Live and Unwrapped"" concerts in Las vegas, so I waited with much anticipation to view this concert at home on DVD. This would be a first for me as I had seen all of Gloria's other world tours in the flesh so I knew first hand what to expect.
Reviews of the show made it sound spectacular and after viewing it myself I have to say it exceeded my expectations. In my opinion, Gloria's best performance was the ""Homecoming Concert"" and this show ""Live and Unwrapped"" has all the elements and pacing of that show with the added advantage of modern theatrics and stunning choreography. Gloria never lets up, her commanding voice and aerobic like performance showcase how much of a pro she really is. The set pieces are incredibly moody and colourful, ranging from the mysterious to the downright fantastical. 16 dancers accompany her on stage, as well as a 23 piece band, moving sets and amazing puppeteers. All in all this is a Gloria show like we've never seen before and if this is a precursor to her upcoming world tour, we have a lot to look forward to.",1077753600,3,1094,4.53030303030303
1986642,3,B0001CCXBQ,"First let me say that I worship Gloria Estefan. She's a wonderful philanthropist and role model for ALL people. I have been listening to her music since ""Dr. Beat"" and love the fact that each CD seems to take a different direction than the last one. I believe her latest album, ""Wrapped"" is the the best on record, with ""Destiny"" a close second. I've been to Gloria's last 3 concerts in Las Vegas, including this one and this DVD doesn't do it justice. It loses 2 stars because of the company that produced the DVD.
Now, let me say that the production company responsible for this DVD release should be fired and never allowed to produce anything again, including home movies. The editing sucked. I could have done a better job of editing the concert. The quality of the cameras is good, but they have some sort of Special Effects Camera and when the DVD was edited, they inserted the Special Effects Camera clips in with the standard camera clips. I think the Special Effects Camera would be fine, had the DVD been properly edited and the clips inserted at appropriate times. And I don't think any camera view lasts more than 4 seconds. It was just too choppy. You can also tell that every camera they had was grounded, so there were no interesting overhead or ""flying"" shots. Also, the sound on the DVD is not very good at all. The volume of the DVD seems to adjust, so I was constantly adjusting the sound on my television. You can hear the band and the  noise of the crowd, but I struggled to hear Gloria. I assume there were problems with the microphone, but that should have been fixed in the editing room.
And there are no extras, just the concert. Couldn't they have added some ""Behind The Scenes"" footage, maybe setting up for the concert or something about the band?
I don't blame Gloria, I blame the production company. If you buy this DVD, just remember that the production company did a poor job with this concert and that it should in no way reflect the quality of Gloria's concerts or of Gloria herself.",1076630400,6,2018,4.5136612021857925

1986647,3,B0001CCXBQ,"I love Gloria Estefan, but this DVD does not represent her best quality concert. This DVD is more of a low-quality piece of work and the concert seems like a big snooze fest.",1342656000,,174,4.303030303030303
1986648,4,B0001CCXBQ,"I saw Gloria's Farewell tour here in Chicago and it was far superior to the concert here on DVD. Missing on the DVD are ""I Just Wanna Be Happy""-the most underrated Gloria song, 'Heaven's What I Feel'. Also missing is a heartbreaking song ""Cuando Sali De Cuba"" Which Gloria sang along with a very young tape recording of herself as a child. The moment was electrifying. Look it up on youtube its sooo good.",1215820800,,405,4.486486486486487

1986650,5,B0001CCXBQ,"I saw Gloria Estefan in concert in Cleveland in 1991 and it was an excellent show.  Filmed some 13 years later, this DVD shows that while she has aged (well) and slowed down a bit, she still puts on a great show.

One of the most striking things to me, however, is that there were young kids at the show - for example, one girl in the Conga line looked to be about 7 years old.  I raise this point because this is a very kid-friendly DVD, so parents can watch it at any time, not just after the kids are in bed or are away at school.",1197331200,,533,3.9166666666666665

1986652,3,B0001CCXBQ,"I went to see Gloria Estefan on her unwrapped tour here in Atlanta, and I tell you, it was great, cheap flamingos, beach plastic balls, palms were all over, I think it was a budgeted concert, the one in Vegas, that poodle and the wowan I think it was so cheesy and tacky! they didn't showed up in Atlanta tough... I love Gloria, I've following her career since the beginning of, I enjoyed the concert better than the DVD. I also think the stage in Vegas was too big for the band and dancers and her of course, too big, sound was ok....They should recorded the Atlanta or New York concert I knew it was great also, her clothing, sound and stage was perfect for her....",1106438400,,667,4.301587301587301
