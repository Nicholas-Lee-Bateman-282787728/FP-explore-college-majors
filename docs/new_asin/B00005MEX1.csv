1624510,3,B00005MEX1,"This movie wasn't as bad as the other reviews made it out to be.  It's a chessy B-movie and if you enjoy them a little then ""Wicked"" is an okay flick to watch.

1624511,1,B00005MEX1,"Obviously a remake of some foreign film, this DVD has a great cast playing paper-thin and stereotyped characters. Stiles plays a typically lippy teen who takes on her mother's role when the mother is gruesomely murdered. Since the DVD package contains a spoiler for the film, I won't be revealing anything here you can't get from the packaging. Adultery, incest, murder, and inexplicable partnerships turn this movie into a muddled mess and the ending is predictable 20 minutes out. If you need an example of a bad film for class, this may be the only reason to get this DVD.",998697600,3,575,4.76
1624512,2,B00005MEX1,"There is a point in this movie where the poor picked on main character (stiles)realizes that physical violences gives power. And in this world of words are mightier than the sword, She changes all that. It is OK to verbaly insult someone to tears, but do not punch them or else your in trouble. So this wicked girl goes around doing physical violence because it shocks everyone. I remember a time when a parent would knock a kid into next week for saying half of what this girl says, But times change... The movie is predictable, there is no character to ground yourself with. It looks like Stiles made this movie years ago. Only worth watching if your a big fan and/or your up real late with absolutly nothing else to do.",994032000,,722,4.4772727272727275

1624535,4,B00005MEX1,"I have tried to watch everything in which Julia Stiles has acted. There have been some smaller roles in the Jason Bourne series, in a hidden gem with William K. Macy entitled ""Edmond"" and the recent ""Silver Linings Playbook"". For me, she is a magnet that draws me in to every character she inhabits. Her catalog of starring roles from comedy (A Guy Thing, 10 Things I Hate About You, Carolina, State and Main) to intense drama (Dexter, The Omen, and the internet series Blue) is well worth the effort to seek out.
When Wicked came out in 1998 Julia Stiles had been acting for several years. As Ellie in this movie you can really begin to see her  master her craft.

1624538,3,B00005MEX1,"Unfortunately, this is not a very strong film.  Stiles is by far the best actor in this, with all the other performances quite weak (with the exception of the detective).

Stiles plays a deeply troubled child, who is attempting to manipulate her father.  To a certain extent, she succeeds, but events begin to slip from her control.  The ending is designed to throw the viewer for a loop, but I found it rather predictable.  The film most succeeds on the atmospherics, which takes place in a surreal gated community, complete with a lonely single mother, a seductive nanny, a deadbeat sensualist neighbor, and a dysfunctional family.  The mix leads to murder and nothing quite ends up as it seems, but I just didn't quite believe it.

I would recommend this tepidly.",1273536000,,766,4.801526717557252

1624541,3,B00005MEX1,"I saw parts of Wicked on Lifetime television recently, and I was intrigued enough to purchase a copy. The film was the first starring role for Julia Stiles, and after she became a major star, Wicked was released on video and DVD.

The movie has the standard Lifetime elements -- a contrived plot, wonderful scenes followed immediately by dreadful ones, broad-brushed characters (the clueless widower; the seductive and possibly homicidal daughter, who traipses around in her dead mother's clothes; a detective channeling William Shatner). However, the plot manages to hold your interest, and I can tell you that the ending will knock you for a loop.

Julia Stiles is deliciously evil as Ellie, the older daughter who is the ultimate Daddy's girl. (I am grateful that the consummation of her relationship with her father is implied, not shown.) The real star of the film is the young Vanessa Zima, who plays younger sister Inger. Not since Kirsten Dunst in Interview With the Vampire was there such a compelling and frightening child.",1238112000,,1033,5.035087719298246

1624543,5,B00005MEX1,"This is a great B movie that I can watch again and again! Yes, it's B quality, but in a good way. The plot, characters, acting, sets, costumes, are what makes this movie work. It's a tongue in cheek Greek tradgedy, and should be viewed and enjoyed as such.",1204243200,3,256,4.244897959183674
1624544,3,B00005MEX1,"I watched this movie on the LMN network so I don't have the dvd but I figured I'd write a review.

I gave it 3 stars mainly for the gorgeous main character.  She is a very seductive teenager and we find out later that she went all the way with her own father almost immediately after the mother was bludgeoned to death.  And it's not like the father forces the issue. Rather she tries to become the mother.  It's very strange.

Is the idea really that the father had been molesting her for years ?  I don't know.  That's one possible interpretation.

She spends most of the movie running around in skimpy clothes.

The story itself is completely rediculous so if you want to watch a movie that is even remotely possible forget it.

But sometimes people like to watch movies just for fun so in that case you may enjoy it.  Even though the story itself isn't realistic the human emotions are.

To tell you the truth I'm still not sure what is going on with this movie.  If the ending means what I think it does that makes it even more rediculous.

For one thing what the ending implies would not even be physically possible.

There's only about 10 main characters in the entire movie and by the end about half of them are dead so you start to run out of possible candidates for who the villain really is.

1624547,4,B00005MEX1,"Okay, I've read some of what my fellow reviewers have said about this film and some are wrong. Folks, you may not want to believe this, but there really are people out there like this. Yes, there really are cheesy detectives and there really are kids like the Julia Stiles character, Ellie. As a matter of fact, Ellie resembles a highly developed RAD diagnosis. They are manipulative, they are obsessive, and they have no empathy. They can kill without a care if it suits their plan.

 You may laugh at this film, as reality through Ellie's eyes can be so absurd that it's funny, but overall, the film has more truth to it than you may want to admit.",1088035200,11,650,4.453781512605042
1624548,4,B00005MEX1,"I admit:  the only reason I rented this movie was because of Julia Stiles' picture on the back of the DVD cover, looking unspeakably sultry and irresistible.  I expected ""Wicked"" to be a cheesy B-movie, and it is.  However, it's a good one at that; I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
  ""Wicked""'s main plot revoles around a highly dysfunctional family in that morass we call the American Suburbia.  The mother is mysteriously murdered one morning, and there are a variety of suspects like a good B-level whodunit movie, with even a cheesy detective included.  However, as the father's oldest daughter begins to reveal the true depth of her obsession with her father by gradually seeking to replace her deceased mother, the murder because somewhat of a sideshow.
  Julia Stiles smoulders like never before as the ber-sultry, forbidden jailbait sex-goddess obsessed with her father.  She eerily dons her mother's gowns, cooks for her father, and eventually seduces him (who could resist?  Honestly?)  Eventually Ellie (Stiles) becomes increasingly more obsessed and evil as she gets into a power struggle with Lena, her father's new girlfriend.  Julia Stile's performance, and the unfolding of the plot, is both grandly disturbing and breathlessly exciting to watch.  The movie leaves you feeling very uneasy.  The director obviously tried to go for a more dark comedy tone, but I was just disturbed period.

1624549,5,B00005MEX1,"I remember first seeing this film at its premiere in the Sundance Festival in Salt Lake City, Utah.
I won't revisit plot points that other reviews go into here, but I will say that it's a rather infectious twist of murder/mystery/thriller/comedy(in a fashion) about a situation dwelling in the realms of the Electra complex.
The fact that it makes you laugh at times almost halts you into thinking:  ""Should I laugh at this?""
After the movie, I met Julia Stiles at the front of the theater and congratulated her on such a gutsy role.  She smiled and thanked me.  Little did I know that she would move on in her movie career!  If you're reading Julia, GOOD FOR YOU!!
It's not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick...I should say, THANKFULLY IT'S NOT.  There are definitely no formulas at work here.

1624550,4,B00005MEX1,"OK, so it has Julia Stiles in it. That may turn a lot of people off. Or maybe on. This was one of her first rolls and it was a direct-to-video semi-hit back in 1998. It's an amazing film and watching it last night, I had to write this review.
WICKED is a movie where nothing is what it seems.
14-year-old Ellie Christianson (Julia Stiles) lives to run away. In fact, she has a suitcase just for that. She never does, always giving up her fight. She always fights with her mother Karen Christianson (Chelsea Field) who's having an affair with deadbeat loser neighbor Lawson Smith (Patrick Muldoon). She seems to only get along with her dad, Ben (Billy Moses) and little sister, Inger (Vanessa Zima). One day, Karen is bludgen to death with a mask (part of the comedy and tragety masks) in her own home, in a gated community. All fingers point to Ellie who never liked her mother much and is always getting into trouble. Ellie was always the Daddy's Girl and a confessed favorite of her father's. So she decides to take over where her mother left off, wearing her clothes and cooking for her family. After she seduces her father, she thinks that they will be together forever. But when former maid Lena Anderson (Louise Myrback) decides marry Ben to get her green card, Ellie gets the idea that she should try to run away again....
The review seems short but I can't write much without giving anything away.
WICKED is a very visual movie. Spetacular colors are used in several scenes. Before the murder, everything around the house is completly white. Making the viewing of blood a lot more shocking and graphic.

1624551,2,B00005MEX1,"The wicked truth about this movie is that the movie was horrible.  I am one to grow soft on criticizing movies that I didn't enjoy by saying that it was `okay,' or `could've been better,' but I have to be frank with my opinion by saying that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Julie Styles is one of my favorite actresses due to the riveting movies that she has appeared in since 10 Things I Hate About You.  But this movie deprives her of that title.
The movie starts out with a rebellious girl, Ellie Christianson, living in a small colorful town with flaky/uptight people who she feels she needs to contest to.  In the beginning of the movie, Ellie's mother is brutally murdered by the saddened face of a drama theatre mask used as a decoration in their home.  The audience is led to believe that Ellie killed her mother to gain the attention of her father's love.  And as the movie goes on, the viewers are resilient in thinking that Ellie isn't the murderer, but her neighbor, Ellie's mother's lover, Lawson Smith, is...
As the movie progresses, other unforeseen twists occur.",1061078400,3,1095,4.51010101010101
1624552,3,B00005MEX1,"I enjoyed this movie right to the end. But then I felt really ripped off. I have to give it credit for the entire movie keeping me watching. But I have to subtract for the fact that the ending ruined the whole viewing experience and left me angered with the writer, producer, director, and studio. If the ending had been different, I would have given it a 5. As it stands, I feel quite generous to rate it a three.",1058659200,3,414,4.1875
1624553,1,B00005MEX1,"Well, if it looks like trash it probably is, and the cover of this one definitely looks like trash.  Hollywood has been busting a gut for years trying to get Julia Styles a big hit, and this was one of her prep efforts.  Stiles plays a rebellious teenager.  A very rebellious teenager.  So bad, in fact, that we are led to believe that she murders her mother to win over the affections of her father.  Or did she?
That's the puzzle throughout the movie.  It's the reason it almost gets a higher rating, but because of the way it was handled, it stays in one-star territory.  The movie does try to be ambitious by showing her taking over ALL the roles of her mother.  And when dad marries the maid that was fired by her mother, boy does Julia get jealous!
All of this could have been elevated to the level of great trash, but unfortunately the plot and direction fall off quickly.  With mom offed rather quickly, you're hoping to at least see a few more people get knocked off, especially an irritating neighbor who keeps putting her nose into everybody's business.  But even this falls short.  Finally, we have one of those endings that are supposed to make us look at what we've seen completely differently.  Is someone else responsible for mom's demise?  Or is this person just taking over the family wickedness.  When nobody who was watching the film with me could figure it out, that makes it just bad storytelling.",1045872000,7,1419,4.535433070866142

What caught my eye was the name 'Julia Stiles'. Big movie name with a movie title I had never heard of. I wondered if it was a movie from when she was younger. First scene...Julia as a pre-teen. So, I knew it couldn't have been an old movie. You can read all the other reviews on what the movie is about. Was it good.....yep. Was it bad.....yep. Did I change the channel....nope. The movie held me for reasons unknown. Movies are meant to tell a story and give you entertainment. Whether that entertainment is in the form of muder, incest and adultury....doesn't matter. It's a story. I liked the movie. Why?...not sure. I just liked it. What I really liked is the soundtrack...which I can't find. Awesome sexy, disturbed music. Anyhow...would I buy the movie?......YES.

1624555,4,B00005MEX1,"This must of been done earlier in Julia Styles career because you can tell the age difference compared to more recent work.  The story revolves around JUlia Styles as a bratty teen.  SHe hates her Mother (and the Mother Hates Her) HEr sister gets everything she wants, and they have a nanny who is a little to perky.  Her only sanctuary is when her father comes home in which case she is in some form of paradise.
Teh story begins when the father returns home from another business trip.  He brings gifts and for JUlia it's a make-up kit.  She loves it.  She tries it out, and does a surprisngly good job of it but the mother won't allow it.  Ironically enough the mother ends up dead later that morning.  You pretty much guess she did it but one would possibly lose an idea or two in the crime scene.
After that JUlia starts to change.  She becomes more like her mother and it goes way to far, until the very wicked ending that you would not have guessed (trust me).

this essentially character driven narrative is a compelling mind- blower of a film. it is deeply disturbing in nature and i think this may have had more to do with why people are rating it poorly than they think. it is easy to be deeply disturbed and pass a negative judgement on the film without giving it a chance. it has some sociologically profound things to say, even though it can be cheesy and b-movieish at the same time. the cinemetography is nevertheless breathtaking as is the psychoanalytic, reverse oedipus-complex type theme. the effectiveness of the suspense and cinematography make up for the few holes in the characters and occassional silliness. also look for the greek drama metephors.",1003449600,3,764,4.930232558139535
1624558,4,B00005MEX1,"When I went to the video store there was only 1 copy to rent on DVD.  No tapes whatsoever.  Obviously we're not talking about an A class movie here.  Anyhow, it took me about 3 weeks to catch before it was in.  Me being a Julia Stiles fan as well as enjoying dark/disturbing films I was fairly enthusiastic about seeing it.  When I put the DVD in the machine i wasn't surprised there were little or no special features (filmographies and a few trailers).  The movie itself is about a dysfunctional family in which both parents are committing adultery and the eldest daughter, Ellie (played by Stiles), has much tension between her and her mother, Lena.  She turns to her father, Ben, for affection, in turn, creating a power struggle with Lena for control over him.  The marriage then begins to fall apart.  In a heated argument Lena threatens to run off with their two daughters.  The next morning while Ben is at work and the daughters at school she is murdered.  At this point a detective is introduced and starts a murder/mystery plot; although when I was watching it my attention was more closely tied with the control between Stiles' relationship with her father.  She tries to fill the motherly role that's missing from the household. As her father pulls away she acts more and more like his wife.  Of course he realizes their relationship can't continue as is and begins seeing his lover (whom he had been with during his marriage) again.  As the movie continues you'll find out who killed Lena and add to that a delightful twist in the end.  I think most people watch the movie and see a B thriller with poor taste.  I'm not surprised as there are a few very controversial elements to it.  Even still, I found the cringing moments gutsy and Ellie's development entertaining.  You get to watch Ellie start as ""daddy's little girl"" and turn into an insecure control freak much like her mother was.  So maybe it's not worth shelling out for your own copy but certainly worth paying the $2 - 3 to rent. Hope this was a helpful review.  :)",1001980800,7,2043,4.56043956043956
