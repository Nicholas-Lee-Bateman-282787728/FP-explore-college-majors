7816575,5,630188230X,"Ever since I was a little girl I have loved Jerry CLower.  He was a wonderful man and a terrific artist.
He has the power to make you laugh without being vulgar and to quote him he ""never made a record you couldn't play in a church"".
Though hard to find I highly recommend this and vol 2.  Not only can you hear his wonderful stories but you can see the master at work.",1068681600,3,369,3.972972972972973
7816576,4,630188230X,"It's not easy to be funny without using the ""seven dirty words"" and Jerry Clower does a good job.  The late fertilizer salesman turned comedian tells a series of ""fish out of water"" stories that are bound to produce a chuckle or two for anyone willing to listen.  The stories may also bring thoughts of nostaligia to those that grew up in a small town, particularly one in the South.  Clower is like the friendly uncle that always has a tall story to tell.  Just like a relative, Clower peppers his stories with friendly bits of advice.  He may not appeal to the most jaded and cynical among us, but for everybody else, he's definitely worth a look.",973641600,3,649,4.466101694915254
