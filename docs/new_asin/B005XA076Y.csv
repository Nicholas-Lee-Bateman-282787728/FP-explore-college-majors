4902460,5,B005XA076Y,This was one of my favorite tv shows to watch when I was younger. I remember watching all the way up to Season 2 before Cartoon Network just stopped airing it. Or apparently I just missed it. I never saw Season 3 or 4. When I first watching season 4 I was amazed by everything that happened. Of course I went ahead and bought season 3 first and watched it. Now I can watch this as much as I want forever. Huge Lyoko fan!,1357776000,,420,4.011904761904762
4902461,5,B005XA076Y,"I have been watching this ever since I was little and it was, for a time, the only thing I ever watched on TV. now it's on DVD and I love it. It is about a group of teens who go in to fight a virus on a super computer named X.A.N.A and stop it from coming out and taking over the world. In this season, the heroes get new weapons and suits. also there are new monsters. X.A.N.A takes his final stand in this season as William, The person X.A.N.A possessed, tries to finish off the heroes and take over the world. Now I do have to say there are two cons to consider here:

1)The show does get  quite repetitive at times. there is very little change in the main objective to each episode though the objective does change slightly with the 2nd season and a lot with the last two.

2)These videos are printed on DVD-R disks. That means that some DVD players will not be able to play these disks. be sure to know your DVD player and it's limits before buying this.

Overall, I have to say that if your into anime and don't mind the fast talking, repetitive nature, and love computers and science fiction; then this show is a must have.",1352505600,,1130,4.169724770642202

4902463,5,B005XA076Y,"This is a 6-disc set, once again the dub is only english.
The episodes are in clear, perfect quality.
When I played them on my DVD player, the episodes never had a problem. When I played them on my Dad's cheap Blu-Ray player, they got stuck one or two times, but that was fixed by turning off the Blu-Ray player and turning it back on. It didn't do that again.

I know there's talk about a season 5 live action set being produced right now; if you are not into live action (personally, I'm not), then this season 4 has its own ending and you can just stop here. :)",1332460800,,1200,4.352678571428571
4902464,5,B005XA076Y,"A fantastic animated show filled with action, drama, romance and comedy perfectly blended to create so many memorable moments.

4902465,4,B005XA076Y,"Well here we are at set 4, the end of the show. It's been a long time coming to get this entire show on DVD. I've reviewed the other two seasons, yet they somehow all have their own unique problems.

Ok, for the visual problems, set 4 is probably the most consistent, there are few irregularities that were present in the sets for 2 and 3, but the problem here comes with any large patch of darker colored frame. Namely, they're just kinda blurry at times, particularly in the digital sea. You can also often see it on characters hair, random darker/lighter colored squares. Like I said, almost exclusively on the darker colors. It's a shame that the episodes are crystal clear as there's a lot of great visual potential in the series, and everyone has new outfits on top of it. Not to mention there's simply more fight scenes, if there was any season that should've been the clearest, it's this one. Also, episode 76 looks like a VHS episode or something, a problem I understand was on iTunes, so likely a source material error once again. And the sound was once again perfect for this set. The few visual glitches that ever did occur were all in the intros, so no biggie.

But on the plus side, it has episode 78, aka that one episode that never aired on TV and wasn't even put up on Cartoon Network's website. This is the first time I've seen the episode in English dub, and it's not like this was just a random episode, if you skipped it, it looked like the writers were suddenly completely making stuff up as it skipped a rather important development. So it's great to see that this episode is in the set, which was one of my major concerns. The final 7 episodes, which never aired on TV but were put on CN's website, are also present. So it really is a complete set 4.

The case is identical to season 2's (except with changed art, obviously), and I really do like the cases they used. Just like the other seasons, it goes for barebones here on disc and menu art. All in all, it's a great package for the price, still probably not worth it to double dip for iTunes people unless you've just gotta have it on DVD. Fans rejoice, your series can now be complete and at a decent price! Just know that these sets are fairly cheap for a reason.",1328832000,3,2244,4.350835322195704

I love everything about this show (the characters, the animation style, the music, etc) and didn't get around to finishing re-watching it when it was still available. I would really like it back.",1468022400,,349,4.833333333333333
8488436,5,B005XA076Y,"I lost this the first time a long time ago, at an airport, and my mom had to look through my stuff at the last moment and I suspect it fell and got broken or stolen! So I'm writing this review in relevance to it's replacement, this copy of the one I repurchased!

About the French Anime known as Code Lyoko, I love this TV Series, despite the flaws in particular episodes, but the idea and story and the character design and skill that it is still known for, is the reason why I love it!
My unofficial review of Season Five is this:

Dear Creators of Code Lyoko Evolution,

You should remake the whole fifth season the same as the first four seasons, but I loved the new 3D sequences and character designs(minus Odd's costume), but I did not especially enjoy the plot and/or story around Aelita and her adopted male guardian being engaged or married to Aelita's biological mother, what kind of s*** is that, also Aelita's mom's hair was pink and at shoulder length, and a whole lot prettier as a 2D character! Stop messing s*** up that the fans have already mentioned and details that need to be fixed!

As far as I'm concerned, either fix the fifth season and keep the characters 2D and 3D as they should be and fix the damn story around Aelita's mom - or - start asking the American and English speaking fans what they feel should be the next step for Season Five of Code Lyoko, leaving out actual people as actors and actresses, and stick with what the fans love, use feedback from fans all over the world and collectively base it on every person's idea as long as it's appropriate for all ages, but attracts older adolescents as well!

About the character William, he needs to accept his fault for why he became XANA's slave in the first place, over-confident and careless, then have the Lyoko Warriors accept his apology and fault after he has trained to become a better team member in Lyoko! As far as the love triangle between Ulrich, Yumi and William... Ulrich needs to man-up as an official boyfriend to Yumi, and Yumi needs to stop being ""hard-to-get"" with Ulrich! William should date Elizabeth Delmas instead!

Sincerely,
Peter Michael Simkins/ committed Code Lyoko fan",1434585600,,2180,4.562659846547315

8488438,5,B005XA076Y,"My kids love this. Have a 4 and 6 year old and it is one of the few shows they agree to watch together...I reviewed a couple episodes it's more like watching a kids version of Tron. No blood or foul language and while the themes seem to be slightly stressful, I don't feel they are to stressful for my kids. The happy ending mantra happens in every episode so I feel it's appropriate. Watch a few and try not to find your self humming the theme song. :-)",1395446400,,454,4.112359550561798
