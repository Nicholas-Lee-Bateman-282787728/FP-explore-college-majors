4675148,4,B005FITIK0,"Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark-hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>). She's absolutely spot-on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Mavis is no Blanche Dubois-type character whose ladylike beauty has faded into a gauzy romantic delusion. No, Mavis is still one hot babe and very much the complete narcissist she was as a teenager, emotionally stunted despite her relative worldliness having moved to Minneapolis to become a ghostwriter of a series of teen novels.

It's not surprising she finds success writing for an adolescent audience since she still defines her life with teenage-level priorities and fantasies. As she has proven with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>, Cody is thoroughly fluent with this perspective, but the twist is that this time, it's coming from a jaded 37-year-old woman. Even though Mavis is a divorcee who lives in a high-rise apartment with a toy dog and can easily get any man she wants, she is triggered by a birth announcement email she receives from her high school sweetheart Buddy Slade and becomes fixated on getting him back all these years later. It doesn't matter that he's happily married and perfectly content living in Mercury. She concocts a scheme to make herself so alluring that he will want to run away with her. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction look all the more edgily desperate.

It's a narrowly developed plot for sure, but surprisingly, what enriches the proceedings is the unexpected relationship Mavis develops with Matt Freehauf, a sad-sack former classmate whose sole claim to notoriety was being the victim of a hate crime when he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay. Now crippled physically and emotionally, he lives in Mercury with his sister making his own home-brewed bourbon and putting together mix-and-match action figures. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their bond is fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. The story evolves in the direction you would expect but not before certain revelations come to light in a tortuous scene at the baby-naming party Buddy and his sensible wife Beth have with all their relatives and close friends in attendance.

Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt. I only know him from his recurring role as a comical sad-sack on the sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-Queens/dp/B005D0OHA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of Queens</a>, so it's surprising to see the amount of texture he brings to this role. As Buddy, Patrick Wilson once again plays the sought-after himbo, but this time, his character's unshaven, small-town modesty comes across as more contrite with his character's feelings toward Mavis left quite elliptical. Elizabeth Reaser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Land/dp/B000P5FH26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Land</a>) isn't given that much to do as Beth, probably by intention, but Collette Wolf has a few impactful moments as Matt's insulated sister still idolizing Mavis after all these years. As he showed with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-in-the-Air/dp/B003E88TKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up in the Air</a>, Reitman shows a deft hand with actors playing flawed characters who try to manipulate their circumstances but fall short of their vaunted expectations.",1324252800,10,4476,6.216129032258064
4675149,3,B005FITIK0,"Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody have been kind of hit or miss for me or at least that's what I like to think. I didn't enjoy Juno nearly as much as everyone else seemed to while Jennifer's Body, while not great, may have been better received on my end than what most give it credit for mostly because I have such a soft spot for horror. On the other hand though, Up in the Air was fairly fantastic all around. With that said, the main thing attracting me to Young Adult was the fact that Patton Oswalt had a rather big supporting role. Despite the fact that Charlize Theron has done so many things since and has won an Oscar, films like The Astronaut's Wife and The Devil's Advocate only come to mind whenever she's featured in anything which isn't flattering at all. So there was kind of this sense of dread going into Young Adult, but was it justified? The short answer is no, but it doesn't completely blow you away either.

There was an Entertainment Weekly article a few weeks ago where Theron said she aimed to not only be a mean-spirited individual, but also easily relatable as well. That's the trickiest part with a character like this. Anyone can be cold or act black hearted, but doing that while also displaying qualities that make you feel sorry for them and/or feel like something you went through in your life is something special. Imagining anyone else in this role is practically impossible, as well. The entire premise seems to be built around Theron. She seems to be playing herself or at least a slightly exaggerated version of how she is in real life. That more than likely contributes to the movie working as well as it does.

One of the other great things about the movie is that it's mostly unexpected. Young adult fiction writer Mavis Gary (Theron) currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota but decides to return to her small hometown of Mercury after receiving an email from her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) welcoming his first child into the world. Mavis somehow thinks that her and Buddy are meant to be together and despite Buddy being happily married and having a daughter that he loves dearly, Mavis thinks they can work past that to make things right between them. The outcome of the events is probably pretty predictable, but the relationships in between unfold in a way that you probably don't see coming. I'm mostly referring to Mavis and Matt Freehauf's (Patton Oswalt) friendship as it goes in a direction that feels far too human for such a superficial individual like Mavis. Oswalt also seems to be playing an exaggerated version of himself as well as he makes full use of his geekiness. The Pixies shirt was also a nice touch. But Young Adult is mostly entertaining due to the way it feels genuine despite revolving around somebody who is as harsh and selfish as Mavis Gray is.

Young Adult is very dark and downright bleak at times, but that's one of its most distinguishing traits. You'll more than likely find something to relate to in Mavis Gray whether it was you who was the popular kid in school, are just as depressed as she is, think you may be an alcoholic, or you're a writer, Mavis isn't really in the right frame of mind and maybe that's the most relatable part of her character. Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt share a kind of twisted chemistry that involves some fairly witty dialogue at times, but is mostly them dragging the other one through the mud with their words, which strangely only illustrates how miserable and similar their two characters are. Young Adult is a very fascinating dark comedy that is laugh out loud funny at times due to its cruelness, but shines thanks to its authenticity.",1323993600,5,3677,4.645161290322581
4675180,4,B005FITIK0,"It's a drama, not a comedy, is the first thing you need to know. This is a slightly awkward coming of age movie. The awkwardness comes from the coming of age being in the mid-30's. A writer of a one-time successful young adult series (she insists on calling herself an ""author""), has escaped her small town, but hasn't left it behind her yet. She returns to regain a lost innocence and discovers her future is waiting. Whatever her future may be, it's not in her past.

I don't get the negative reviews because it was believable and funny and Id call it a dark comedy.

Starting with the title ""Young Adult"".  37 is not a Young Adult.  20's are young adult and time to make a complete ass of yourself with self-destructive behavior and ignoring mental illness.  This premise that she writes for teenagers therefore is stuck in a teenagers mindset doesn't ring true.  The dog is more the metaphor for the entire picture.  She paid more attention to her manner of dress, breaking up a marriage, getting drunk, and dodging calls from her editor than caring for something that is dependent on her and her alone.  She sticks the dog on a cold balcony while pretending to work.  Stuffed into a bag when hitting the road.  Left alone for days in a hotel room.

The story still has the same tropes, a hot mess with career issues decides to reconnect with an old flame. In any other rom com, she would be this adorkable chick with the sassy gay friend who, with a convoluted story, gets the guy or his best friend. This films turns it all inside out. I liked the disdainful Mavis who clearly had moments of genuine vulnerability and problems but no one saw her as such, so she keeps this fantasy alive in her head that she will get Buddy.

SPOILERS

Nope, right as she is feeling shaken up and is open to evaluating her mistakes, learning and growing, she talks to the worst person possible. She talks to a woman who's insecure, and deluded in thinking pretty people who live in the city lead fabulous fulfilling lives (the geek girl mythical thinking that pretty popular girls have perfect lives).

4675307,5,B005FITIK0,"No clue why this is at 3 stars. It's a fantastic movie. Basically a twisted version of a Hallmark movie. The realism is impressive as the main character Mavis switches her day-to-day look from shabby old t-shirt wearing manchild to seductress, since no one is beautifully made-up 24/7. Background characters in the small town give the side-eye her wondering ""wtf"" whenever she is in her stylish city attire. Her friendship with Hoffman is also a play on the ""supportive gay side character"" - except he's not gay and has his own issues. Somehow their dysfunctional friendship felt more real than 90% of the movie friendships I watch.

With this she attempts to reset by going back to her hometown and attempting to rekindle the relationship she once shared with her high school beau, one catch, he's happily married.

4675342,5,B005FITIK0,"I have a bit of a love hate relationship with Diablo Cody. I despised her ""Juno"" while the rest of the world loved it. So I didn't think I would like this. But, I did.  The movie is about Mavis Gary. Mavis is not doing so well at the moment. She is living in a nasty apartment, writing a YA book that has been cancelled, and is divorced. She gets a random e-mail about a high school boyfriend's baby and becomes obsessed with getting him back. To me this is the equivalent of all those people on your facebook feed that insist on presenting how happy they are... but you know they aren't. Mavis immediately recognizes that he isn't happy and wants to save him. She returns to her nothing town with that intent.  Along the way she meets up with a former classmate who didn't have too good of a life but they are instant buds. Matt was beaten up in high school and still has the scars but he has the negative sarcasm that Mavis has.  They are enjoyable together. Mavis bonds with Matt while pursuing her boyfriend and Matt is the voice of reason the entire time and the best part of the movie.

Of course... eventually it all goes to heck. Mavis is lost and embarrassed. But Matt's sister comes up with a great speech at the end that is unexpected and true. Mavis' problem isn't that she can't get her old boyfriend, it is that she would ever even want to. Most people in that no nothing town, couldn't write a book, aren't pretty like Mavis, and really don't matter.  They cling to their ho hum lives because that is all they will ever be or have but Mavis is capable of so much more and should never look back at them. Her only mistake was coming back there and trying to fit in.  Matt's sister wishes she was like her.  Mavis is amazed and struck and says ""thank you"". That was the smack she needed.

Sometimes I see this film described as Mavis as a narcissist, but a hallmark of a narcissist is that they aren't better than others they only think they are. Mavis is demonstrably better in this movie.  She also never would have hung out with Matt and his sister Sandra if she was a narcissist or a bad person. I think people don't like this movie because of the end. They are the people who cling to their ho hum life and, if at the end, Mavis had been told off or left in disgrace it would have affirmed their no nothing lives as the best.  But to hear that Mavis' only mistake was devaluing herself and coming back to the podunk town... yikes.",1521936000,4,2448,4.256465517241379

I gave it a try due to Charlize Theron. Why is she in a movie like this? Didn't she already show her deep acting stuff on that monster movie, which I never saw? Sad to see her in something like this. Hope this isn't her vibe in real life. Couldn't make it past maybe 45 min? maybe 30 min. 10 of which were her unpacking in the hotel room.

There is no guilt to tie this woman down as she tries to reconnect within a community that only pities her because of an acknowledged mental illness.

Charlize is brilliant in this and Oswalt helps a lot as well.  The rest you know from a box cover ...she lives in a high rise in a cool town and is successful as an author so some in her little home town look up to her and some look down on her for not staying in this tiny town and pushing out babies at 22.

4675373,5,B005FITIK0,"II think this film is brilliant . From the accurate and ironic tittle to great acting . It's also a difficult movie to love. ""Yong Adult"" is brutal in its depiction of average person's life. Especially if that person believes she is special and much better than her peers. Charlize Theron's acting is so believable, that her character makes you cringe. She is stuck in her young adult version of reality and is not able to see how foolish she is. Perhaps, she could be less cynical in some situations , so we could feel some empathy to her in the end. Personally, all I felt towards Mavis was embarrassment and pity ( a little). I imagine that in real life person like her leaves nothing behind but useless drama and accusations addressed to the rest of the undeserving world. Meanwhile , she moves on without shame or regret.

I don't recommend this movie if you are looking for a comedy or motivational , ""learned a life lesson"" kind of stuff. This is a honest, slightly exaggerated , deeply satirical film. Makes you stop and double check if you are not living in self made fictional version of life and if it's not time to upgrade, grow up and act as adult. Even if it's less exciting than high school.",1509926400,7,1206,4.4818181818181815

When you have more interest and feelings for a murderess something is wrong. I didn't even care if she redeemed herself or not. I only stuck it out to see the end and I liked many of the other characters; especially Buddy and Beth. Even though Buddy had poor judgement in wanting to hang out with such a depressing, obnoxious, person.  Spense was a little annoying though.

4675390,5,B005FITIK0,"YOUNG ADULT is a color film, taking place in the present era, and situated in a fictional village called Mercury.  Mercury is not far from Minneapolis, and in the movie, there are a couple of references to Minneapolis as being the ""Minnie Apple.""  The overall plot, is that the main character, played by the ever-so-abundantly-easy-on-the-eye Charlize Theron has a job in Minneapolis, where she is the author of a series of books for young adults.  At an early point in the movie, she travels to her home town (Mercury), where she went to high school and where her parents still live.  Her goal is to re-claim the heart of a high-school sweetheart, played by Patrick Wilson.  But Patrick Wilson's character is happily married -- his wife is played by Elizabeth Reiser.  As an adjuvant to this overall plot, the Charlize Theron character has some real mental problems, taking the form of her obsession with Patrick Wilson, and also taking the form of addiction to hard liquor.  Another of her problems is that, although the townspeople think that she has made it ""big"" by being a published author, and by living in Minneapolis, it is actually the fact that her book series has been cancelled.

MOST OF THE TIME WITH PATTON OSWALT.  Most of the time spent in this film is not with the former boyfriend, but instead with another high school acquaintance played by Patton Oswalt.  Patton Oswalt's character is known as the ""hate-crime boy"" because of the fact that during his high school years, he was attacked and beaten and received crippling injuries to his legs.  As such, Patton Oswalt's character takes the form of a portrait of courage, since he is never disclosed as falling down the slippery slope of bitterness and regret.  Instead, he has a steady job in the local watering hole, and he is an avid home brewer.  At an early point in this movie, Charlize Theron visits the local watering hole, and sitting near her is an obese man, played by Patton Oswalt (in real life he is obese, but not crippled).  The contrast between the drop-dead gorgeous Theron and dumpy Ostwalt is striking, but Theron's character does not ignore him when he attempts to strike up a conversation.  In fact, the two characters develop a deepening relationship during the course of most of the movie.  Charlize Theron sympathizes with the fact that he is crippled, and they devote much time discussions the roadblocks found in life's course.  Theron's character is also attracted to Patton Oswalt, because of his hobby of brewing hard liquor.

ELIZABETH REASER AND DETAILS ON OTHER ACTORS..  As stated above, Elizabeth Reaser plays the happy wife of Patrick Wilson, and the two have a young child.  A high point in this movie, is the ten minutes or so spent showing Elizabeth Reaser on a drum kit, playing rock'n'roll with her garage band at a local tavern.  Elizabeth Reaser's broad grin, which she wears during the entire rock'n'roll song, is one of the many reasons to watch this movie.  Ms. Reaser has been in about 23 movies, Patrick Wilson in 37 movies, Cherlize Theron in over 40 movies, and Patton Oswalt in about 40 movies.  Patton Oswalt is also an accomplished comedian, and some of his performances are available on YouTube, and I recommend this preformance: ""How Patton Oswalt & His Daughter Are Coping With His Wife's Passing.""

BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  Because of the general elements of the plot line, I was expecting the film to be rather dull.  In fact, before watching this movie, I thought that it would be one of the many, many box office bombs that are available from my local library.  But in fact, the movie was  much better than expected, and a trip to Wikipedia reveals that it was not in any way a box office bomb.

She uses alcohol as a crutch, but so do the filmmakers--we have to watch every drink she takes just so that we'll believe that she's really an alcoholic, I guess. And how this is billed as a comedy is beyond me--there was nothing even slightly funny here, unless you enjoy watching a cruel and pathetic woman trying to regain her high school ""glory"" by trying to get a now-married man to sleep with her.

I think they really had a great concept, but it ended up just being a cliche' ""grass is always greener"" sort of story. I think with some more character growth and some change on the part of Charlize Theron's character, there could have been some depth to this movie. There were parts of this movie that were nearly painful to watch, which were brilliant, but there were also parts that were slow or underdeveloped, which really took away from that. On the plus side, this does give you hope that the girl who was terrible and caddy in high school ends up unhappy and living in the past, which honestly was the crowning achievement of this film.

Critical reviews aside, I found this movie drab, poorly written, with characters that are unappealing and downright stupid in some instances.  I could not relate to any of these characters.  The plot seemed so far fetched, as it developed, that I finally gave up about two-thirds of the way through the movie.  I missed the ending, true, but I have no regrets.

A very moving film. Though at some points during the film some may expect some more movement and perceive a rather static lull, it is overall a very good, light and moving film that everyone needs to watch. Everyone says,""I have a lot of problems"" just as Mavis says. As she says that it takes a lot of things to make her happy and all the other people seem so content and happy with their lives, so is everyone in their own place. When you are faced with a situation, it is best to take a good look at the situation and kiss it goodbye and say,""Life here I come!""

4675884,5,B005FITIK0,"Mavis Gary is a ghost-writer for a Young Adult book series called Waverly Prep. Mavis writes about herself in the form of an alter-ego within her books, via the main character, named Kendal Strickland.  From audible narrations of her writing we hear Mavis's thought process. We are privy to her profoundly stunted emotional condition. It seems Mavis, who is actually thirty-seven, is still a girl, specifically...a teenager. When we meet her parents halfway into the film, we can glean heaps of insight from this pitiful scene. Mavis attempts to break through their solid wall of see no evil, hear no evil domesticity, with absolutely zero success. It seems like she has sat through a lifetime of those moments. Mavis returned to her tiny hometown to go back and retrieve her life with her ex-boyfriend, Buddy. Buddy recently became a new dad and emailed Mavis a birth announcement containing the photo of his new baby girl. Mavis stares at the picture of the child...we don't quite know what she's thinking, we see wheels turning, but what are they grinding out? Mavis has decided that Buddy sent the email as some kind of coded message. Mavis responds to his only visible to herself plea, and sets off on her journey to rescue her true love Buddy from his captors.  Only Buddy never was her true love; he was her once love and that's a huge difference. Buddy is neither bright, brilliant nor even faintly interesting or engaging. He is however...a nice guy, there's nothing wrong with that, but Mavis needs much more than what Buddy could provide.  This is where her relationship with the diminutive and injured Matt shines.  Mavis is her real self with Matt.  She hides nothing from him. He responds terrifically to her genuine personality. There dialogue is playful, humor filled, teasing, delicious and fun. If Mavis weren't trapped in the life of the external, she would grab Matt and return to her big city Minneapolis with him in tow. But Mavis is in the full throes of a desperate identity crisis, probably one she's had for her entire life (Borderline Personality Disorder). When the party at the end of the film explodes all over Mavis's beautiful new dress her extreme fear for own sanity sends Mavis directly to Matt.  She literally and figuratively strips herself nearly naked and standing in front of him wholly exposed asks him to 'cover her'. He does. He wraps his arms around her and offers her acceptance, love and protection. In the morning Mavis is calm and even kind to Matt's sister. They begin to talk. Mavis now knows that she needs to think and behave differently.  She knows she needs to grow up...until Matt's sisters halts Mavis's epiphany in its tracks.  It is this moment in the film that I believe Young Adult loses much of it's possible positive reviews. We watch Mavis grab at the adoration that is thrown at her, we see Mavis accept the worshipful words and we're appalled. She leaves to go back to her lonely apartment....and we think it's over, we think Mavis is over.  We think she's the same, but is she?  Once again we hear Mavis's thoughts through the words of Kendal Strickland.  She blows a kiss good-bye to her high school years, she buries the memory of her former boyfriend and she's ready to face the world.  She says it sweetly, without any lofty pretenses, then she goes to her car and stares at the damage she caused when she partially wrecked it while driving drunk.  We see her blending a better outlook on life with her actual reality. Mavis has changed, we just have to stare at it a little more closely.",1473379200,,3558,4.72859450726979

If you were expecting this to be a movie about a hardened city girl with a messed up life going back to her small hometown making it happen after being humbled by the kindness, generosity and simple ways of the townsfolk, eventually coming out the other end a stronger and better person and leading the kind of life she never thought she would because she is a  hardened city girl with a messed up life blah blah blah,  then you are sorely mistaken. This is not what this movie is about.  I suspect all the negative reviews come from people who were taken aback from this movie that is not really adhering to the clichees and tropes we have come to expect from such movies.

Not even the tagline ""The girl you HATED in high school is BACK""  is accurate, because this is not some sort of a flick about what happened to the hot chick in Mean Girls after she graduated.

Young Adult is the story of a woman, Mavis, in her mid/late 30s who suffers from depression and mental illness. It is the story of  a woman whose life is a mess as a result;  she is an alcoholic,  which is one way mental illness manifests - via substance abuse  - and she has very few redeeming qualities.  If she did not look like a model on the runway, no one would have put up with her abuses and scary behavior at all. I suspect the only reason a lot of people do is because of her looks.

She treats everyone like crap, is self absorbed, cynical, self destructive, dismissive, bitter and angry.  She has a rather frightening effect on others, but seems completely oblivious to it.

After seeing the pic of her ex high school sweetheart's (Patrick Wilson) new baby -  who, by the way, is a really boring and dull person not really worth conquest, she decides, in a delusional stupor, that they were meant to be together all along and that this should have been her baby, so she decides to go back to her hometown of Mercury to get him away from his wife and what she perceives as an ugly baby. Her delusions, instability and utter despair become very obvious to the audience now who, up until that point, may have been waiting for a funny punchline.

If you disliked the character, if not flat out hated her, and felt miserable watching this movie, then the writer and director did their job, because that is the whole point. You are not supposed to laugh with or even at the protagonist or even like her. She feels alien and  uncomfortable to us.  An unpleasant person we would not want to spend a minute around, much less 90 minutes.  She is someone we will want to avoid at all costs,  while the only time we do hang around them is either out of social necessity or pity, much like the people in Mavis'  life at her hometown. They all know something is wrong with her, they all sense her mental anguish but put up with her out of pity and politeness.

And  In a way, that is what mental illness is, right?  It is a torturous existence for the mentally ill person who is just drowning in the toxic waste that is depression (and in her case also Borderline Personality Disorder) and it sucks for those around her. Mental illness and especially depression are very isolating to the point of becoming a self perpetuating cycle.

People, much like the audience of this movie, do not want to hang around a depressed, self deprecating, angry and unstable person who, on top of that and because of her mental illness, mistreats and abuses those around her. The way the audience feels watching this movie is pretty much exactly how the people around Mavis feel when she comes in the door.

For once, the audience is not just looking in, but actually taking on a role. Mavis loneliness, misery and negativity  are palpable,  not just to the people around her but to the viewer.

On an intellectual level, Mavis understands that ""something is wrong"" with her, she knows she is an alcoholic, she  feels unloved (which is what exacerbates her depression and self doubt) and she does want to be happy. Just that she doesnt know how to. Her depression has taken so much out of her, she is lost. And despite wanting to be loved and happy just as the rest of us,  she is not able to do the things that people who are loved and happy do.

The ending may irritate people because there is no resolution:  She does not walk away a better person who has learned her lesson. She is not all of a sudden wise or found someone who shares her loneliness. On the contrary she goes back to her routine and thanks to the very last conversation she has with an old high school class mate who thinks the grass is greener on the other side and assures Mavis that the problem is not her but the ""fat"" and unhappy small town folks,  Mavis  emerges out of this feeling not only validated but also wronged by the hicks and losers in her small town. And that, again, is exactly what mental illness is: denial, an inability to see clearly, a distorted view of the Self and the world, with every act  being perceived as some sort of an indictment.

That there is no resolution for Mavis,  that there is no happy or unhappy ending either way,  but rather just the continuation of the same is just what real life  and real mental illness are. They don't just go away after one eye-opening experience. They are not something one can choose or wish away at will. They follow you, they hold you down, they keep you drowning and do not end at the end of the 90 minutes. For those who hated this movie because of its depressing thematic: think of it this way: you and Theron can walk away from this at the end of the 90 minutes, but depressed people, the same as Mavis portrays, do not have this luxury.",1452556800,4,5849,4.348987108655617

Charlize plays Mavis, the former prom Queen who has not evolved since high school.  She is unhappy and alcoholic, but rather than change her life, she decides to get her HS boyfriend Buddy back in spite of the fact that he is happily married with his first baby. The comedy is in her social disconnect from the world around her. She still thinks she is the queen, that she will triumph, but everyone has moved on except those as damaged as she is.  She is befriended by Matt (Oswalt) who she completely ignored in school even though their lockers were next to each other. He hasn't evolved much past his HS bitterness and hurt (severely beaten by the jocks). Matt's sister can't see what everyone else can see in Mavis - Mavis is a sad person in need of a true friend. Matt's sister still thinks Mavis is a Queen and still wants to be Mavis, completely ignoring the disaster that is Mavis, and gives her bad advice. Amazingly, her true friends are Matt ( who is tough love honest with her) and the family she is trying to break up. Buddy and Beth have enough love to see she is in trouble and want to help until Mavis blows up that opportunity too. She just can't get real. Charlize and Patton are amazing. They are the original odd couple if only Mavis could grow up (hence the title).",1416873600,8,1402,4.430232558139535

But, mostly, this film was about the life-wasting result of living one's life with no thought or care for anyone but oneself.  Theron is a beauty queen who's lived carelessly toward others through her life; now she's paying the price of no one liking her.  Good movie.  Bad job with the title--""Young Adult"" is ""so"" non-indicative of the subject of this movie.  ""Beauty Queen, Now 28"" or something like that would have hit it better.

Her tunnel vision prevented her from picking up on the slightest clues as to how her behavior would affect them. There were a few accidentally humorous bitsthat thankfully offered momentary relief. Too many unpleasant awkward moments though. If done differently it could have been a comedy where the outrageous and ridiculous (i.e. think Bridesmaids) are entertaining and leading to some larger meaning but it wasn't even close.

She learns that her happily married high school boyfriend just became a father and she takes it as a sign that they are destined to be together and becomes a deranged stalker.  Patton Oswald (or is it Oswald Patton?) plays yet another sad character in the film but he is the one who breathes life into this movie.,1394150400,,474,4.413793103448276

Sadly, she is the author of a series and she uses this as a way of helping her finish her series. In affect, her life is a sham and so is the belief that her old flame wants her back. She is stuck in her quest for adulthood. The only person who is supportive and makes her feel good about herself is slammed, showing her mean streak and inability to really care about anyone else.

The positive reviews of this movie are all accurate. The negative ones are mostly by people who were looking for a totally different kind of movie. If you want a dark comedy, watch something else.

Took about 3 sittings to watch the whole thing.  I get it, that there are people like this out there in the world, but why feature them in a film?  She was so vain and out of touch with reality, it's a bit disturbing that she wrote children's books.  The only positive scene in the movie came in the last few minutes.

4676738,4,B005FITIK0,"Sour as a vinegar popsicle is what the New York Times says about this movie.
It also says the movie is brave and breathtaking.

Which, of course, it is.

The viewer is along for the ride as Mavis, a 37 year-old woman who earns her living ghostwriting teen novels, tries to redirect her aimless life by connecting with her high school sweetheart, Buddy. Buddy is inconveniently (or conveniently?) married to a non-blonde named Beth. Buddy and Beth just had a baby, something they for some unexplained reason want Mavis to know.

Mavis calls and talks with Buddy while he is busy freezing fresh breast milk, generated thankfully, off camera. The fact that he does this so expertly while talking on a cell phone shows how comfortable he is with his new role of husband and father. Why he would want Mavis back in his life is not explained until much later in the film.

Encouraged by his invitation to attend the naming ceremony for the new baby, Mavis avoids her editor and drives back to Mercury, Minnesota, where she grew up and which was the scene of her glory days.

Mavis whips out her laptop periodically to work on her current book, the last one apparently, as the series is being canceled. You can just spend so many years in high school, I guess. Mavis stays current with teen dialog by eavesdropping on strangers. She does not appear to have any friends.

Mavis is a slob and an alcoholic, but we root for her as she takes out her wiglet and primps herself for Buddy. She cleans up surprisingly well for a woman who has a nervous habit of pulling out her hair.  What she sees in Buddy is hard to imagine. He is almost forty and still has lunch with his father everyday.

Avoiding the fact that this whole episode could just as easliy have occurred during an alcohol fueled dream, what if the roles were recast?

What if Mavis became Marvin, a writer of, say, graphic novels, or video games (no, too hip, lets stick with graphic novels). We would watch as Marvin whips out his toupee and primp wildly to look good for someone he knew as a teenager, a woman who is now a Mom in her thirties who stores breast milk in the freezer.

The creep factor would escalate to slasher movie levels, and this story would no longer fit uncomfortably into the romantic comedy genre.",1389225600,,2274,4.510948905109489

Many people have trouble with relationships and end up alone. This is an intelligent movie and Charlize Theron is always fascinating to watch.

It's more of a deluded fantasy because the viewer hears an occasional lofty narrative, but what plays out is a weird anti- fairy tale.

The main character leaves her phony glamorous life as a young adult book writer due to a miserable existence and heads back to small town USA where she grew up.  She tries to capture the boyfriend of her teens that is now married and has a baby.
Great acting all around as the psychological passings of life give you a zing. Alcohol fuels the fire as an old nerdy high school classmate tries to set her straight while living in his own undesirable state. A film about not growing up and being full of yourself. There's an entertaining sadness about it all because it is done so well, unlike the crap that's often in films that drag you through tears.

People crying out because they had to see something that actually depicts a real character instead of a crafty and contrived version of a life that is palatable to them. They would probably rather watch the Kardashians.  I do wonder why they even felt they had to let people know how offended it made them feel without any sort of criticism other than the plot itself which is just a framework of a complex character study. It really just shows that many people cant handle anything that isn't sugar coated.  It feels as though i am walking through a cult of normalcy that is just seething with denial and blindness to lifes darker sides. There is a richness in this movie that makes it far more pleasurable and colorful than the formulaic developments of most comedies and brings a new twist to dark comedies.  There is a great lack of sympathy for the main character in those bad reviews.  But thats a just a personal dilemma.  Whether you can relate to the character or not does not constitute how good or bad a movie is.

4677160,5,B005FITIK0,"This movie caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard about it at all and stumbled upon it on cable. Seeing Charlize Theron didn't pique my interest one way or the other, but I liked the others in the cast as well as the director, so I stuck around. What a fortunate discovery!

The plot of this movie involves a small town homecoming for a mildly famous, alcoholic, self-loathing, ghost writer (Theron), overflowing with contempt, delusions of grandeur, and relentless narcissism. The writing is brilliant and the moving performances by Theron and Patton Oswalt make it shine even more.

What stands out most for me is the way in which writer Diablo Cody captures the dichotomy between those who left their small towns and those who stayed. In particular, she addressed with deadly accuracy what happens when we create stereotypes to make us feel better about our damaged lives. I left my small town after high school, and it took me a while to realize that not everyone who stayed there was a loser, nor everyone who left better because of it. The only truth we can count on is that we've all changed, the past is dead, and all that has happened in between merely transformed that old friend into a familiar stranger. Cody doesn't give us the epiphany moment (thankfully), but rather allows us to see how we all deal with the past in various ways, and how that shapes our self-image.

The unfortunately high number of one star votes reveals a lot about the expectations of movie fans for escapism, simple answers, and uncomplicated characters. You're not going to get much of that in Young Adult. What you will get is a brutally honest movie about a side of life that most don't want to acknowledge.

I hope to see them in future scenes. I'd go so far to say this is my favorite Charlize Theron movie. The actress is funny! And dark!

If you are the type of person that has gazed around the gym, mall, Cineplex, Applebees, or corporate office space, slunk your shoulders, and thought to yourself ""I hate everyone in here,"" then this flick is for you. Mavis and Matt are in your camp. She is a total bitch, but the film successfully shows how she has reached this point. Broken people relate to the world in a negative way. We have unhealthy coping mechanisms. Relief comes when you make a connection to the one other person in the room that understands. The films that provide that same relief are rarely made, but I'm so grateful when they are.

Charlize Theron's performance is very good and the movie somehow avoids feeling formulaic, but there's something inherently depressing about the not-very-good people that make up the primary protagonists.

4677250,4,B005FITIK0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

By definition, I think a great movie is one which makes you feel and makes you think long after the credits roll. This movie worried me, bothered me, made me go seek out reviews and ultimately made me rewatch certain scenes to clarify what got me so upset. Just about every reviewer, whether the professionals or amateurs, says Mavis is HORRIBLE and her behavior is indefensible and I can see why on the surface that might seem true. But just a damn minute, here. Buddy's wife starts out the movie by doing something just stunningly horrible. She e-mails a baby announcement to Mavis. Think about it. Why would she do that... 17 years after Mavis is no longer with Buddy. I actually stopped the movie to make sure that the e-mail said FROM BETH SLADE and TO MAVIS, and you have to ask yourself how did she even get ahold of Mavis' e-mail address after that many years. Once you realize (especially in light of later events) how horrible that was, you begin to review your feelings about Mavis and about how she behaves. BIG, BIG spoiler: Late in the film she tells a whole crowd of people that she had been pregnant when she was 20 with Buddy's baby, but had suffered a miscarriage, which evidently left her unable to conceive. I feel like Beth had to know that, which makes her behavior in sending that announcement especially cruel. So this rips Mavis' misery wide open and she unwisely decides to GO GET BUDDY, convincing herself that they had been perfect for each other and all they need to do is get back together. She searches out an old mix tape given to her by Buddy, captioned ""Mad Love, Buddy,"" meaning those songs were meant to be meaningful to them both, and she plays, and rewinds and replays one song which must have been the MOST MEANINGFUL one. Did you see the look of shock and pain in her face when that's the first song played by Beth's band, as if crowing that she got Buddy and now that song belonged to her. How f-ing cruel was that? Yeah, yeah, Mavis is a mess, a drunk, delusional, career going downhill, heading towards middle age with little to show for it... but if you just think about what happened to her is it really so hard to feel empathy for her pain, for her despair, for her need to get back what she lost? Of course, she can't. And I swear to God I can't believe how clueless Buddy is. He's almost literally a cardboard cutout and in all reality had Mavis been able to get him back, he would have bored her pants off in no time. The only thing I have a hard time forgiving this movie for is the way it created this wonderful person in Matt and then, in the end, just leaves him behind. There will never be a sequel, but in my head I keep seeing her realize, once she's back in the Mini Apple, that the real human being she should have in her life is the man who's just as damaged and just as smart as she can be.",1374796800,,2892,4.3161764705882355

This is a very brave part for an actor because there is no redeeming solution. Director Ivan Reitman let the movie flow organically, some of it must be improvised. He uses the same deft hand that he used on Juno. Anothert great actor working today is Patton Oswalt. If you have not seen his work you are missing something. He continues to amaze. I have been lucky enough to follow the career of Diablo Cody from her writing here in Minneapolis to her Academy Award for Juno. She is a great talent and I can hardly wait for her next script.

What is interesting, and why I gave it four stars, is that I really enjoyed the way the story was portrayed.  Real circumstances, lines, attitudes; everything is believable.  I didn't have to sit through any cutesy little moments of slapstick, or ""aww"" romantic scenes, it was just an honest look at a real character.

So why'd they tell this story? To force me to rewrite that scene at the kitchen table with our antihero and the sister?

If it weren't so well done, I'd have pressed the ""Unwatch"" button and cleansed my soul of it. And I adore Theron and Oswalt.

Teetering on the brink of soul-crushing. Not quite funny enough to make up for the bleakness. Not one I'd recommend because there is no ""Unwatch"" button on your soul's remove control [pro tip: watch this one with a rohypnol at the ready -- it's as close as you'll get].

4677392,4,B005FITIK0,"In Young Adult, Mavis Gary has led a successful life as a YA ghostwriter, but after receiving a blanket e-mail about her high school boyfriend's newborn daughter, she returns to her hometown, Mercury (like, totally, a whole `nother planet y'all), to steal him back. On the wind, her life spirals out of control, as she misses her book deadlines, begins drinking (it is hinted, not for the first time), crashes her rental, and spews profanity and hate wherever she goes. Ultimately, Mavis's story deals with pathos rather than her ex, choices she has made, and the inevitability of her life, your life, all lives, surging forward heedless of the benefits of hindsight.
Charlize Theron is amazing as Mavis and my favorite performer, playing a truly reprehensible character for much of the film, while Patrick Wilson plays her ex-boyfriend, Buddy, as competently Good Guy as he does in most of his roles, leaving Patton Oswalt to provide the sympathy and also embody the weakest part of the script.
Oswalt is Matt Freehauf, one of Mavis's former classmates that never managed to leave Mercury, primarily because of the severe beating and resulting disability he received in high school when a rumor floated that he was gay (he isn't). I love this character. His life is richly detailed but each element - his disability, his endearing nerdy hobby, his potentially money-making hobby, the night(s) he spends with Mavis - could easily be replaced with something more familiar or nostalgic to any individual member of the audience, creating a wish fulfilment cypher that automatically invokes trust in the viewer. Because of this and despite Oswalt's terrific performance, Matt also has more in common with the Friendly Native, the Magical Negro, Jiminy Cricket, Clarence the Angel, or even Scruff McGruff the Crime Dog than a real human being. He speaks for Mavis's conscience and to voice the audience's nagging critiques of her behavior, then later provides a safe place for her to unravel in the third act, leaving me with the nagging suspicion that he isn't real, and the artificial reality of the film breaks down.
There is a turn at the end. Mavis is humiliated but still loved, which shames her into confronting those things about herself that she doesn't like. But then, on the precipice of realization, at the summit of her character arc, her selfish behavior and callousness are reinforced and she leaves much the way she arrived. The ending is all the more believable for this, though no less depressing.

This film is difficult for me to justify adding to your collection because of the Matt Freehauf character, though it contrasts nicely with Take This Waltz, an equally depressing film also about lost young people, albeit on slightly more optimistic paths. But it isn't nearly as overwritten as Diablo Cody's last venture, Jennifer's Body, and the realistic portrayals of 30-something social dysfunction, the comedic beats, and even the satirically turned out wish fulfilment fantasies - landing the prettiest girl in town or returning to your hometown, sophisticated and wealthy - make it worth the shelf space to me. I may grow tired of Young Adult (though I haven't yet), or mature out of its influence, but until I do, I own it, and you might as well give it a watch.

For those who care, it doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, and those adverse to naughty language or horrible people might want to give it a pass.

4677468,4,B005FITIK0,"Theron is excellent in this movie as a woman in the midst of a nervous breakdown. Her character is so unlikeable, yet realistic, and despite her horrible personality you can't help feeling sorry for her.

At the age of 37 author Mavis Gary finds that she has hit a wall. Her young adult series has been cancelled, she's divorced and clearly suffering from depression. She self-medicates with alcohol and fast food, and comes up with a ""brilliant"" plan to win back her high school boyfriend Buddy - not because she never got over him but because he is associated with the happiest time in her life when she was popular and admired by all.

That should tell you a lot about the type of person Mavis is. Shallow, spoiled and vain, she is unprepared when life doesn't go her way. Instead of dealing with disappointment like an actual adult and growing from it she tries to relive the past. Sadly for her though her journey back to her home town only makes her unhappier. She can't believe that the people she grew up with could be so content with so little while someone as fabulous as her is unfulfilled. She especially despises Buddy's sweet wife, a woman who is the opposite of her in every way, but who Buddy adores.

When she stumbles upon Matt, one of the losers from her high school that she wouldn't have deigned to speak to back then they form an unlikely friendship. Matt is permanently damaged from a violent attack in high school, and his sarcasm and raw honesty are exactly what Mavis needs. He shows her the dark side of the high school world that she longs to return to, and even manages to get a few glimmers of humanity from her. It's not enough to prevent her spiral into self-destruction and there is no neat ending where she learns the errors of her ways because it's not that kind of movie (I wanted to punch Matt's sister when she tells her she doesn't need to change). I know some people don't believe it's a comedy but I did find it very funny in a dark way. It was also extremely cringe-inducing and at times I couldn't bear to watch. An unusual combination of black comedy and pathos. Unlike Mavis this movie is a winner.",1368576000,3,2143,4.461734693877551

4677575,1,B005FITIK0,"""Young Adult"" confounds all expectations, including its own advertising, and not in a good way. Billed as a comedy and brought to us by the folks who created the winsome ""Juno,""""Young Adult"" turns out to be an unremittingly depressing, frequently ugly film that resolves itself in the end with a baldfaced lie. The premise of the film is recycled and old as time: a wandering ""star"" condescends to return to her hometown from the Big City to show the local yokels what it means to be important -- while of course setting herself up for the inevitable lesson that the ""folks at home"" are worthier than their Big World counterparts. And yes, ""wherever you go, there you are."" Numerous good films use the Homecoming Revelation to good effect -- funny, moving, even instructive -- but ""Young Adult"" is not one of them. No comedy indeed, it is largely a deeply offensive and demoralizing film. Here's why. First, the main character, played by Charlize Theron, manages to be pathetic and narcissistic, and to get herself into all kinds of trouble, while never eliciting a single shred of empathy or care from the viewer. It's a character whom we totally dislike; she's not even good to her dog (says sweet things, but neglects the pooch). Theron does a fantastic job bringing this failed and dislikeable person to convincing life. It is not at all the great comic turn advertised; it's a chillingly convincing rendition of an empty, awful person. It's a performance to admire but the viewer's main experience is one of revulsion. Plot? Well, this awful person causes genuinely cringe-worthy things to happen all around her -- watching it all feels like throwing up, and the film is mostly unbearable as a result. The resolution? She up and leaves for the city, we hear upbeat music and some words contending that she is now going to be a good, together person. This is the big lie in the film. The notion that people change their lives and their very character (and in this case, overcome alcoholism) just by deciding to do so is grossly untrue to the entire history of mankind. This lie diminishes all the true life stories of real people who have made themselves into better people, friends, and lovers not merely by concluding that they should -- we all know we're supposed to be good -- but by doing something about it. There's not one whit of demonstration of change from the main character. The only bright spots in ""Young Adult"" are the constellation of minor characters who are laboriously making decent, loving lives. But the movie is not about them -- all are thinly shown and undeveloped. What the film gives us is something else again: a reprehensible, self-centered, unlikeable protagonist whom we are to believe transforms herself through the magic of momentary thought. Apparently, all you need to remake everything about yourself is a good intention! Like most people, I like most movies and don't need or even want every one to be great. Good is fine! But occasionally you run into something really foul -- a film that based on a diminished and false view of human nature -- and ""Young Adult"" is one of those rare films. It may have been conceived with good intentions, but the actual film on the screen is, in what it shows and what it means, an awful thing indeed. I honestly feel diminished for having watched it.",1364774400,,3327,4.747841105354059

The acting is quite intense, but comes across as very real -this film is really about the narrative. The main character goes from someone who is uncomfortably quirky, narcissistic and painful to watch in a superficial sense, to someone who is painful to watch because of the depths of their disfunction.

4677714,4,B005FITIK0,"Young Adult starring Charlize Theron is not one of those fluffy romantic comedies as it was portrayed to be. This film written by Diablo Cody and directed Jason Reitman (the winning duo behind Juno) is about a divorced woman who writes young adult fiction novels, and pretty much has a ""breakdown"" when she goes back home to try to win back her ex-boyfriend who's now married. Theron nails her role as Mavis, I don't think any other actress could have pulled it off but her. Mavis is a very delusional, depressed woman who drinks way too much, pulls out her own hair, and her life as a writer is coming to an abrupt halt. The thing that was the most frustrating and yet real about Mavis is she really makes no attempts to change her self-destructive behavior. Mavis will do anything to get what she wants, and along the way her friends and family start to notice she's falling apart in more ways than one. This movie doesn't have a clear-cut ending which makes Young Adult seem believable, but this movie is not for everyone. It's not a very happy film, there's a lot of unanswered questions and Mavis is not a likable character so it does make it nearly impossible to root for her.

Instead, I was treated to a stark, yet strangely tender, look at what it means to grow older without growing up. Theron gives a supple and ""adult"" performance, making hairpin turns from desperation, determination and denial to humiliating scenes of tenderness. She paints a portrait of a pretty girl that is ugly and, in its way, more truthful about the pains of aging and confronting the limitations of one's own nature than many ""serious"" dramas. The role has more meat on it and more room for Theron to maneouver than many self-serious psycho-dramas. This movie made me hunger for more psychologically complex roles for women, and for Theron in particular.

I have no idea how this movie ever made it into the ""comedy"" category, but suspect that this label was itself meant as a joke--and to fool a public that would have little idea what to do with a movie that is properly uncategorizable.",1362960000,,976,4.809523809523809

If you've ever read any of the literature on this terrible mental illness or by chance come in contact with an individual who suffers from this disease you will find this film relevant and informative.

Charlize Theron has a very good take on Narcissistic Personality Disorder-(NPD). Her films ""Young Adult"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" are Spot On character studies of persons afflicted with this awful impairment.

This film is very educational and informative to students of psychology in it's depiction of a person afflicted with this personality disorder and what their life might be like. It is heart wrenching and shockingly tragic and sad. The emptiness and desperate search for emotion and stimulation is painful to watch.

This film shows how Narcissistic Personality Disorder is almost akin to a sort of ""Living Death"" and the futile desperation to become alive as other people with families, careers, support groups, loved ones and all the other accouterments acquired from a fulfilling life.

Such disordered individuals inspire anger, resentment and hatred to the uninformed. Once one understands the disorder and its tragic dynamics on the sufferers; one cannot have anything but immense pity and sorrow for such an unfortunate individual because their life will never be a happy one. Relationships with persons such as these are doomed to failure!

Or, rather, give us something to hold on to. If we are given anything to hang on to, it's the hope that she will eventually learn from all of this and find her ways. Alas... that is only false hope and proves to be too ""Hollywood"" and you're left with nothing (except for two hours you'll never get back). You never feel sorry or sad for her. How many good movies have you seen where there was a protagonist that you didn't care for one bit? She appears to be an alcoholic, which is a character flaw many can relate to, but no one feels bad for a person without any redeeming quality. For example... Denzel Washington's character in the recent movie ""Flight"" is also a raging alcoholic, and a crack head to boot. There is nothing to like in his character either. However, the audience connects with him because he is divorced and his son wants nothing to do with him. Plus, he saved over 200 lives by flying a plane upside down. (How can you not like that)? You feel for the guy when he struggles to stay sober. The end of that movie was typical Hollywood, but still managed to surprise the audience.

Maybe I just come from a place where we all grew up and got our crap sorted out in a timely fashion with no psychologically intriguing side effects, because the whole premise of this movie was absolutely preposterous, similar to one of Jack Black and/or Ben Stiller's stupid ""ordinary guys in extraordinary circumstances"" flicks. It was also similarly awkward to those films. No comedy. Just painfully awkward situations and the most awkward sex scene I've seen in recent history, let's be fair. I felt not an iota of empathy for any of the characters and walked away not liking any of them, or even loving to hate them.

4678027,5,B005FITIK0,"YOUNG ADULT once again combines the directing talent of Jason Reitman with the writing talent of Diablo Cody. Their past hit film was the quirky, teenage comedy, melodrama JUNO which I enjoyed but found to be, for myself, a bit too cutesy and overly lovable in both the story and the dialogue. Now, with their second film YOUNG ADULT, it provides evidence that JUNO was not just a fluke.  These two continue to provide concrete evidence that they are great at what they do.

This film's dialogue is dark, ironic and completely unpredictable. The story is offbeat and quirky yet somehow identifiable. Charlize Theron is brilliant as the one time high school popular girl who, now in her mid thirties, has spiraled downhill and is clutching on to her illustrious past by writing a series of teenage girl novels. Patton Oswalt steals the show as the awkward, geeky guy who had a crush on Theron in high school and, because of a tragic bullying experience, is now handicapped. They play off each others fears and quirks with hilarious and sometimes poignant outcomes. On the outside they seem like complete opposites but are more similar than either one wants to admit.

After receiving an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby by her high school sweetheart and his wife, Theron decides that this is the most opportune time to return to her hometown and ""rescue him"" from an ordinary life as a husband and father and to rekindle the romance they had in high school and college.  Her ex-boyfriend is played by Patrick Wilson and he, along with the audience, is taken off guard when Theron returns and acts as if he had been waiting for her all this time.

I won't say any more except that this film is really unique and outlandish but also very deep and complex with a showstopping scene near the end that finally brings some answers to her odd and unorthodox behavior.  This films shows what a versatile an actress Theron is.  This film along with her Academy Award winning portrayral of the serial killer, Aileen Wuornos in MONSTER, provides proof that she is not just another pretty face.",1358899200,,2086,4.714285714285714

She is not just a passive good wife.  She is not just a nice ordinary person.  She is no pushover.  You see glimpses of how funny, quirky and smart she is, so you understand why Buddy/Patrick Wilson is mesmerized - and completely in love with her; he is following her lead.  Elizabeth Reaser's performance is just perfect - from her smiles welcoming Mavis, her enthusiasm playing the drums, and the hurt look on her face when Mavis/Charlize Theron bellows at her.  Beth is essential to the story, more than Buddy, and her performance reinforces Mavis's desperation and loss.",1358899200,6,749,4.944

The rest of the story had some good takes about parents, old flames, becoming 'an adult', shallow teen-age stereotype novels, and much else.  The ending was a bit clipped, but there was nowhere else to go with the story at that point, and it's up to your own point-of-view where she goes.  The final kitchen table conservation with the dweeb's sister was a bit hokey, but still made sense.  I thought it was off-beat with laughs but an underlying seriousness ... thumbs up.",1358899200,,823,4.483221476510067

4678034,5,B005FITIK0,"I saw this film in the theatre when it came out and saw it again on tv the other night. I am struck by the dichotomy of Amazon's reviews and wonder how so many viewers could hold such opposite opinions. See for yourself: at this writing, 104 four and five stars, 85 one stars. I conclude this excellent character study of a narcissist steps on a lot of toes. Why else the near hatred reserved for this film? A few thoughtful reviewers did note a similarity between themselves and the Mavis character, so someone got something substantive, maybe even insightful, from it, unlike those who found it a `waste of my life'. Hmmm.
At any rate, Young Adult has many attributes: the acting by Charlize Theron and others is spot-on; scenes that may appear throw-away or uneventful to some reveal personality. One reviewer questioned the manicure scenes: but what normal woman would get two manicures in two days? No one. Only a self-obsessed, desperate woman would think changing the color of her nails is going to make someone else's  husband fall for her. She ignores or resents her only friend, a Pomeranian. She relates to a hotel clerk and others with gratuitous lying, mostly about how she came to be in town at all (""real estate thing""). Her contempt for others is palpable; and what about the self-contempt? Her slatternly lifestyle is on parade through her apartment, vehicle, diet, and wardrobe. It's as if she thinks her beauty is enough, but the truth is beginning to break through and make her miserable. And while there are `darkly comic' moments, this film is anything but a comedy. Observe the train wreck unfold.
Through minute chinks, the truth outs itself. Mavis flatly states to her clueless parents ""I may be an alcoholic"" and they brush it off.  After the excruciating scene on Buddy's front lawn, Mavis sees herself for what she is. Some reviewers say there's no point, no plot to this film. They're not paying attention. The denouement comes quietly, at Matt's kitchen table during a conversation between the newly-discerning Mavis and Matt's sister, who crushes Mavis' s revelation by assuring her that she's the same superior being she's always (never) been. The light recedes from Mavis's eyes and THAT is the point of the film. Redemption was offered and rejected. A soul spins into oblivion.",1358467200,70,2311,4.848101265822785

4678071,4,B005FITIK0,"I enjoyed watching Young Adult and thought the characters that Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt portrayed were entertaining. The movie starts out with the character Mavis Gary (played by Charlize) who is struggling with her career as a writer and overall emotional well being. She soon decides to pack up her briefcase with her small dog and travel back to her home town where she grew up at in Minnesota, looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, who is now happily married and has a newborn daughter.

The first night back in town Mavis Gary bumps into an old school acquaintance, Matt Freehauf (played by Patton Oswalt). Both having emotional baggage, they feed off each other to alleviate their loneliness and insecurities. These two characters I thought were the most interesting of the movie.

Without giving away anything else such as where the movie goes, and what transpires, I will say that I enjoyed the story because it had a realness to it. Good Job Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt.

And as a side note, the character ""Beth Slade"", (played by Elizabeth Reaser) did a good job playing the envied new wife and mother of the baby. Not many parts but definitely made an impact.",1358035200,2,1200,4.815533980582524

This seem to be billed as a crazy comedy movie like Bridesmaids or Hangover II that came out that year.

4678087,5,B005FITIK0,"Nobody reads long reviews, so I'll try to make this one short.  This is the tale of an alcoholic ""young teen"" who searches for her lost youth by trying to reconnect with her high-school boyfriend.  He is, however, happily married.  She is in denial of her alcoholism, her lost youth, his marriage, her lost dreams, and, like many alcoholics, repeats an alcoholic pattern in her life only resulting in further despair.

The trailer did not do the movie justice.  The trailer gives the mistaken impression this is, somehow, a comedy.  It isn't.  The character Ms. Theron plays is complex and difficult to analyze.  The protagonist, a partially-crippled, slightly overweight high-school classmates whose locker was next to this ""prom queen"" reflects how evil high school can be--wrath so many of us know as coming from the prom queens and ""jocks"".  Yet, all over America, high school continue to nominate, and vote for, their ""mean-girl"" cheerleading squads and ""jock"" Homecoming Kings--only to, in reality, despise them in later years.

This is that film.  But, here, the ""mean-girl"" really despises herself, her failures, and in reflection somehow seemingly makes amends with her old chubby classmate--only to, in reality, use him to fulfill the same cylical alcoholic spin-cycle.  Her old boyfriend?  Not a major player.  He isn't the story.  She is.

It's a great movie.  If you want to retroflex your hatred for high school, reflect on your own failures, and bury yourself in another drink of bourbon, watch this movie.  I'd love to see a high-school literary class rip this one down to its educational basics.

And, I dare say, if you're every nominated to be homecoming queen, or prom queen, or head cheerleader, you have just been relegated to being hated the rest of your life.  We all know it, but this movie shows it.",1357689600,2,1825,4.96039603960396

4678092,1,B005FITIK0,"I entered into this movie thinking it was going to be a comedy and I don't think I laughed once the entire way through it. It's not a deep film. It's about a bitter has been woman who sees the end of her career looming ahead and suddenly longs for the good old days. Death to Smoochy is a dark comedy. This? This is a train wreck.

Now, I have to concede that the acting is well done. It was very well portrayed for what it was but the bottom line of the film was just terrible. I kept waiting for it to get better cause no person that isn't deeply mentally unwell stays so down so long but nope, nothing. In the end of the film no one came full circle. No one learned anything.

In fact, I could have dealt with it being bleak and a character study into someone mentally unwell. I could have written off that hour and a half of my life but what really upset me the most is that the movie ended with her using the one person who tried to help her throughout the film and just when she decides to change her delusion is reinforced by someone else. So after spending the entire film behaving badly and wallowing in her own delusions they end the film basically having someone condone what she's done cause she's one of the ""beautiful people"" and everyone wishes they could live her life.

Really movie? Really? That's how you want to end? Taking cold comfort in the form of the crippled guy that's supposed to be the physical parallel of your emotionally stunted growth and then having his sister tell you that nothing you've done is bad because you're better than everyone else?

4678108,5,B005FITIK0,"I initially did not have any interest in seeing this movie based upon the trailers.  I saw this movie because it was free with Amazon Prime.  This movie is nowhere near as much of a downer, depressing, or sad as indicated by some of the other reviews.  There are depressing and sad moments throughout the movie, but I also found myself laughing at a lot of the lines and situations.  I may have a somewhat dark sense of humor, but how can you not laugh at some of the ridiculous statements and situations in the movie??  There's a lot of tongue in cheek humor to be had from the perspective of the movie viewer.

Despite the outrageousness of the characters, I thought this was one of the few movies that rings as being honest, real and relatable with most people's lives.  The movie is filled with people who are leading unhappy and/or boring lives and who don't know it and/or are unable to admit it to themselves or to other people.  But none of them know how to deal with their own unhappiness, might as well as the unhappiness of others.  Surprisingly, it's Mavis who turns out to be the most genuine, real, honest and self-aware character in the movie.

And because her character is so completely trashed by so many of the other reviewers, I feel the need to defend Mavis.  She is desperately unhappy and she knows it.  Unlike almost all of the other characters, with the exception of Freehaul, she knows just how unhappy she is even if she can't always admit it out loud.  But unlike the other characters, she DOES admit it out loud and for all to witness.  The scene where she lays all her emotions out to bare at the baby naming ceremony has got to be one of the most honest scenes I've seen in a movie.  I love Charlize Theron, and she owned that scene.  The emotions were so raw and real that it felt like my own nerves had been ripped open for everyone to see.  Mavis is not a hero but she's very real, and to me there's something to be admired in being able to admit the truth no matter how ugly it is.

There are no heroes in this movie.  All of the apparently ""normal"" and supposedly well-adjusted people in this movie are just as messed up as she is in their own way, in my opinion.  For instance, what kinds of parents refuse to acknowledge the very real and obvious unhappiness in their daughter even when she tells them that she thinks she is an alcoholic?  What kind of unaware self-obsessed woman thinks that a surefire way to cheer up her husband's ex-high school girlfriend, who she thinks is lonely and confused, would be to invite her to their baby's naming ceremony?  Yes, I'm sure that will cheer her right up and make her feel less lonely and confused.  Seriously, WTF?  I've got more examples.  What kind of messed up fool thinks that it's at all acceptable to invite the woman who had a miscarriage with his baby to his baby's naming ceremony?  Did he forget that she miscarried his child??  Did he also forget that he kissed her when Mavis was confronting him about their alleged feelings for each other?  Pretending something didn't happen doesn't mean that it didn't happen.

The people in this movie are messed up, and it's not limited to Mavis.  She's not even the most messed up in the movie, in my opinion.  But there's something very true about this movie, along with the darker humor, that makes me love it.",1357344000,8,3346,4.436065573770492

It's not just the physical trip and its implications and misconceptions, but the excruciating journey of self-discovery while stuck in the haze (and maze) of an alcohol-induced fantasy world that will make you cringe and groan. The acting is truly great and the characters well defined--so much so that the movie ""took me in"", as though I was a part of it. This is not a comedy though--it should be in the drama section.

4678199,4,B005FITIK0,"I had to write a review, where I usually do not, because there are so many low scores for this movie, and after reading the reviews it seems a lot of people are missing the point. There are many great movies out there where the star character isn't someone to be admired or even liked. The point is not to like her. And the point is also not to have a happy ending. If you are looking for some sunshine and rainbows, then watch a Disney movie. This is supposed to be dark. It is supposed to be a close look at a damaged individual. If it makes you uncomfortable, it intended to. I'm just amazed so many people give this bad marks because it didn't ""make them feel good."" I think those people had the wrong expectations, which isn't the movie's fault. If you take it for what it is, a sad look into the life of someone struggling to accept reality, it is a fairly good movie. The actors all did a superb job. And while I did not like Theron's character, I for one could not help but feel sorry for her, because she was so unstable and clearly had some mental issues. This is not a character that just wasn't nice. Many of you are missing that she also was mentally ill- an alcoholic, someone whose anxiety caused her to pull out her hair, depressed- Rather than abhor someone for having these traits, I'm surprised more people didn't feel a tinge of pity for her. The only way she could cope with her mental state was to revert to high school and over-compensate by believing that she was better than everyone else. My point is, those of you who rate this low because it wasn't happy clearly missed the point of this movie and should just watch something like ""Air Bud"" if you want to go away happy. The idea behind this movie is to make you think about mental stability, about the people out there some of us all know who peaked in high school and stayed stuck. Also, I felt at least at the end, although she wasn't ""cured"" (which would have been unbelievable without professional help, especially so quickly), she at least vowed to put high school behind her. The only way her mental state allowed her to do that was by believing she was still better than everyone else. I think the sister telling her she was wonderful was also just to show that Theron was so eager to believe it was true and that her mental stability wasn't superficial. Also, that there are people out there who will always idolize those in high school undeserving. And there are still those from high school who still wish they could impress the ""jocks"" and ""popular crowd."" Even years later, so the sister character made complete sense, as also someone optimistically sad. Please, if you enjoy movies for more than just the happy take-away effect, give this one a shot. I think many of the 1 and 2 star reviews are from people that are a little too ""in the clouds"" and superficial for a movie that is dark and makes you think a bit.",1356652800,5,2905,4.371534195933457

A very slow and long movie that has no good point or value to it.  The main character is a ""young adult"" author but I think a kid could have written a better plot!  It was depressing, slow, and in general a waste of time.",1356652800,3,496,4.290322580645161
4678201,3,B005FITIK0,"Diablo Cody has a voice, and seemed to have it right from the get-go with ""Juno."" She has an eye and ear for interesting characters and comes up with way left of center situations to put them in. This might not be her best but it's still well worth the watch.

Here's the scoop. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a ghost writer working on the final installment of a series of books written for young adults. The series has run its course and she doesn't know what she'll do when it's finished. She receives an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby fathered by an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). She psychotically takes this as a sign she should visit him to rekindle a relationship with him even though he is happily married. She makes the trip and, as one can imagine, screws everything up.

This is a character driven movie and Charlize is at the center. She is an alcoholic who cannot seem to get over her glory days as a high school prom queen, who could have had pretty much any guy she wanted. She can't carry on a meaningful conversation and lies incessantly. She has a tiny dog but why? She barely seems able to keep it alive much less fulfilled. She will plot and maneuver to get back with her beau and has deluded herself into thinking he's not happily married. She runs into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) with whom she was locker neighbors in high school. Now he's on a crutch after a beating he took at the hands of some jocks who thought, mistakenly, that he was gay. But he lives with his sister and does the things that mean something to him. He builds and paints super hero models, distills bourbon and other things that take his mind off his loneliness. He also doesn't take any crap from Charlize. He lets her know she's screwed up and that what she's doing is crazy and wrong.

There's a lot to say about this movie so I'll stop here. This is a very good, very watchable flick. I liked scene after scene. Jason Reitman has been very consistent in his projects and is on the money here. The biggest problem is the ending. It's as though she didn't know where to take the character and just tacked on a totally pat, unbelievable ending. But it's still better than a lot of the stuff out there.

There's a couple moments where she thinks about taking the first of maybe a dozen steps, then returns to her drunken depression. I expected some sort of growth, or realization.

4678244,2,B005FITIK0,"I'm a fan of director Jason Reitman, in fact, his previous film, Up in the Air, made the very top of my Ten Best list in 2009.  Young Adult was one of my most anticipated films of 2011, and while the film is executed with fine craftsmanship, I'm afraid that the message being served with these talents is just downright socially irresponsible and off-putting to anyone with taste, class, or sense.

I can't fault the fine performances given by Charlize Theron, Patrick Wilson, or Patton Oswald, they're all in fine form, and lend their characters believability.  Yet, all of the good will established in the first 80 minutes of the film is completely undone in what I feel is a shameful epilogue.

There's probably an alternative way of approaching this film's closing act; one could argue that a speech delivered by Oswald's sister is simply a means of feeding Theron with the only thing she may be willing to hear, just to get her out of town and stop destroying the people in it.  And, I can see how someone could see the ending in this way.

However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the speech was actually a means of preventing Theron's character from becoming a better person.  In this scene, Theron's character looks for all the world as a woman desperately in need of saving.  She seems sincere in her willingness to change.  And, at this point in her life, when she needs to hear something that will help her, she just winds up finding another woefully misguided soul that feeds her a bunch of crap about being better than the so-called healthy and happy people.  In fact, all of her grotesque behavior is being heralded as some sign of being exceptional, above the need for civility or mental stability because she has killer good looks and a job writing fiction.

If Theron's character had actually been given an opportunity to change, then I might have agreed that this film honestly depicts a sociopath, but as it stands, I see it as the same B.S. message from Hollywood -- people who aren't in the limelight aren't worth a minute of your consideration.

I hated this movie despite its technical brilliance.",1356307200,,2122,4.674731182795699
4678245,2,B005FITIK0,"First the good: The performances in this movie, by and large, were well done. It's practically a given that Charlize Theron did a great job, and Patton Oswald, while not particularly believable at times, ably filled his role. I would have liked to see more of Collette Wolfe, who had a tiny performance as the sister of Patton Oswald's character, but pulled off the subtle comedic nuances that otherwise wouldn't have come through in the dialogue.

Also, as far as the story arc and narrative goes, it turns in ways that are often unexpected.

Now, the bad: If you are a big fan of dark comedies, this may be your kettle of fish. Personally, I think it's incredibly difficult to pull one off well. Most of the time, they are not deeply thoughtful or unique, but as formulaic as the films they seem written to criticize--simply taking a dark left turn when most other movies would turn right. This movie falls squarely into that latter camp.

Rather than having a narrative or a character arc, Theron's Mavis careens from one train wreck to the next. [sort of spoiler] While the ending is surprising, it does not redeem the movie at all. It just left me with more questions about the odd future of this horrible person. [end spoiler]

I had some hope for Mavis to change at the end after the naming party, but Matt's sister ruined it.

4678252,5,B005FITIK0,"No, she's not quite that bad. If you are expecting the traditional American Rom Com with rosy happy ending and predictable in the first 10 minutes, you will hate this movie.

Mavis Gary is having a crisis. Work is pressing for the last book in the teen series she writes continuing the story created by another writer. With out the acclaims. No one knows she writes it and the series is dying. So she is rethinking her life/loves after a divorce. You can see the world pressing in on her brain. And her journey begins back to the happy days she wants to recapture.

The poor girl is neurotic and evil. Or maybe sees others as a means to what she wants. She plays the emotionless flat affect with the antisocial behavior to a tee. The scenes with her mother and father and the hair pulling disorder trichotillomania bring in some reality and focus I thought. As the movie progresses you see her evolution or will it end up devolution. I could not tell where she would end up. And I admit it ended more realistic I think. Scene with the sister is sublimely ironic. Karma.

You still kind of like her even at the end. Just a little bit. This is due to the skill of Charlize Theron and a Diablo Cody script, directed by Reitman. The scenes with Patton Oswalt are fantastic. They need to work together more.

This is more of a character study I think than a dark comedy. Though there are elements of dark humor. And Charlize, can she do a bad movie or part? I tried to remember a bad part she did and came up empty. Monster, a movie I didn't really like, was some great acting. I think you could put a bucket on her head while painting a fence and it would turn out good.

If you like varied types of movies you should see this. At times I wanted to look away from the screen at what she was about to do. Don't listen to the one star reviews. No way is this only a one star. There are plenty of factory produced American films to make them happy. I like a good factory produced happy ending predictable movie complete with silliness but I need films like this too. Something to break into the numbness-watch this movie to see what I mean.

4678274,3,B005FITIK0,"This movie was both funny and uncomfortable. I initially liked it because the character Mavis reminded me of someone I knew in h.s. who also chased an old boyfriend around. Theron does a great job of portraying a misguided, mentally unstable character. She is the beautiful, shallow girl who never emotionally developed, hence why she is a Y.A. writer.

She is terribly unhappy, an alcoholic who wants to believe that she is free because she has shunned marriage and family. She makes it her goal to liberate her high school boyfriend Buddy from his otherwise happy marriage and new baby. The dream of getting back together with Buddy somehow might satisfy the longing for what she never had, but could have had if she had done things differently and made different choices.

I am rating this movie a 3 because it might be a masterpiece, not sure, still processing it. Mavis definitely represents a demographic I have seen as I am in the same age group--the beautiful woman who partied in the city, had one night stands instead of deep relationships, who focused on appearance and having a good time (which descends into alcoholism). Now she finds herself childless, unmarried, aging, and despite all the years has not developed any sort of moral compass as to what is really important in life. In that way, Mavis is very representative of a particular type of person in our culture.

She believes everyone from her hometown is inferior yet asks herself how they can be happy with so little. She is unable to learn the lessons that she needs to in order to grow as a human being. It is comedic and tragic. Theron is truly a great actress.",1355356800,,1638,4.700348432055749

Charlize Theron plays the most selfish, unlikeable and despicable character I've seen in a long time...and she's magnificent. Her futile meltdown at the end is priceless. Patrick Wilson shows more depth of character than I've seen from him, and was quite good. Poor pitiful Patton Oswalt plays a guy we've all known; misunderstood, out-cast and bullied mercilessly in his youth, he's become cynical and all-knowing in his lonely later years. It's really not as bad as some of the 1-star reviews claim; the only unlikeable character is Charlize, and it's played fearlessly.

I thought the script was clever in many places, and laughed out loud a few times. It's not really easy to watch, and I'll never buy it, but I'm glad I saw it. There are a lot of films about ""You can't go home again"" (my favorite being ""Old Joy"").

4678280,4,B005FITIK0,"I have to wonder about the one and two star reviews. Some of them seem to be merely because the viewers were expecting a typical romcom or other ""lite"" romp, but with the exception of misleading trailers, I don't think the movie should be blamed for that. There are, indeed, cringe-worthy scenes in this film, but there are also laugh-out-loud moments. But what I really enjoyed was that there was no moralizing - the viewer is free to take away from the experience what they will. Mavis is not a terribly sympathetic character, but neither is she always wrong. When she attacks Patton Oswalt's character for letting his past define his life, she's being hypocritical in the extreme, but also perceptive. Her belief that suburban, married life can be a prison sentence is not entirely unjustified, either. But the real issue at hand is that her high school sweetheart has actively participated in his life, making choices that suit him, while she has been swept along, helpless. Mavis has a life - she just can't recognize it as such because it's happened TO her rather than being created BY her. And for a lot of us, that probably hits too close to home. Even when you think you're the one making the decisions, it's not uncommon to wake up in your late-30's, early 40's and say, ""How the heck did I end up here?"" To me, this movie is really about one woman's ruthless determination to avoid the introspection required to answer that question, and her lack of motivation to do anything about it.",1353283200,3,1496,4.670454545454546

4678282,1,B005FITIK0,"This movie is awful.  It is proof that you cannot make a good movie by simply putting an academy award winning actress in it, even when her performance was incredibly good.

The story is utterly non sequential nonsense with no dialogue continuity.  Theron's character is a 37 year old alcoholic who discovers her high school boyfriend just had a baby, and she decides to try and win him back.  The first 5 minutes of the movie show her in her self absorbed, narcissistic pointless life, having a one night affair, and leaving the guy in her bed as she dons a Hello Kitty shirt and drives off in her Mini Cooper to the little town in Minnesota where she grew up.  This short time is supposed to introduce you to this terribly flawed human.  She then arrives at a bar where a guy - who in high school she would not have (and did not) even notice - recognizes her, and they *immediately* strike up an in depth conversation demonstrating both of them as flawed and life abused.  Nonsense.  The guy is a cripple, apparently having been beaten to an inch of his life by a bunch of jocks who thought he was gay, to the point his penis is ""bent.""  This poor cripple - who does not even know the former boyfriend, then goes to some great length to try and disabuse the woman from her youth-recapture effort.  Nonsense.

The story is so bad - there are multiple characters that are randomly introduced, who have some ""small town"" connection to the main character, and then they disappear.  Why?  For example, in a bar scene, a guy in a wheel chair appears - turns out he is one of those happy go lucky wheel chair bound people and the cousin of Theron's character?  Wait, what?  So what?  Why?  Pointless.  The dialogue here is just stupid.

This is not a black comedy.  If that is what they were shooting for, they missed it by a mile and then some.  Someone else compared this to Christian Bale's effort in American Psycho.  Trust me, there is NO COMPARISON.  American Psycho pulls you into the main character's psychosis.  You want to watch a *masterful* black comedy - watch Kevin Spacey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty-Sapphire-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B003VJTGLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray</a>].  That movie defines the genre.  Black comedies are often narrated - this movie is not narrated.  They are narrated because it is hard to convey the rich flaws in just 2 hours of visual work.  This movie has effectively no sound score that builds either momentum or suspense.

In the end, this is a movie with a bunch of sad people doing sad depressing things.  And the end of the movie . . .  I won't spoil it because it cannot be spoiled . . . she just drives off.  This movie is like listening to a musician who plays technically perfect with no soul or musical sense.

When I looked here at the rating I was flabbergasted to see 5 star reviews.  Many of the scenes mentioned that were allegedly ""hilarious"" are so awful I literally was squirming.

Notwithstanding the horrible script, lack of plot, lack of direction, lack of remotely suspenseful music or soundtrack and implausible dialogue . . . if there is a redeeming part of this movie, it was Ms. Theron's performance.  Her acting range is extreme, and some of the ""evil"" looks she gives to the boyfriends wife . . . sends chills down your back.  Her performance, as good as it was, simply does not save this horrible, horrible waste of celluloid.

4678283,5,B005FITIK0,"I had to post a review after noticing that this movie has really polarized audiences.  There is no doubt this is a dark comedy - perhaps what may help people who are considering watching this movie is to know what to expect out of a dark comedy.

Watch the trailer.  Notice that Theron's character is a walking train wreck that still makes any red blooded guy's jaw drop to the floor.  Notice that in nearly every scene in the trailer, Theron comes off as totally off, from the dog in her bag, to the binge drinking, to how she constantly tries to steal a husband who is happily married with a newborn child, and how everyone in the trailer knows she is a tad touched in the head.  If you found the trailer to be hilariously funny, you ain't seen nothing yet...that's just a warm-up to what will promise to be one of the funniest movie's you'll see in a long time.

The laughs are similar to the laughs American Psycho delivers.  Christian Bale's signature film is also a similarly disturbing movie with another character that is totally off, yet somehow Bale is able to make you laugh again and again at lines that are so inappropriate that one can't help but to admire the comedy.  Like American Psycho, this movie also comes attached with what would otherwise be deeply disturbing content (if not for the humor), although not quite to that bloody of a degree.

If you found American Psycho to be such a turn off that you had to turn away in revulsion, expect a similar result after viewing this film.  If you found American Psycho to be one hell of a dark comedy that was loaded with social commentary, you will find this film to be along the same vein, except with no blood and more laughs.  I have to commend Theron again for taking on a very challenging role - to act out a character that many will love to hate, will face no small amount of humiliation, and will leave audiences hating her even more when it is all said and done, all while looking her best.",1351555200,4,1964,4.397790055248619
4678304,5,B005FITIK0,"Everything about this movie is perfect. From the casting to the writing to the direction and acting, it's all here. There are no cliches, predictable happy ending where she ""gets her man"" or even a real clear sense of who the protaganist is. It is a very slow burn so if you are looking for gags and a quick pace this is not for you today, but come back to it when you want a movie that smacks of realism. If you are a writer, then you will definitely see yourself in this character.

Theron is flawless as the lead character, hurtling toward 40, but with a clear case of arrested development who ironically makes a living writing ""here today, gone today"" teenage novels for readers who are the same age mentally as the author. She gradually becomes the character in her latest manuscript and just as the end of the series is inevitable, so too is her time in her home town.

This movie works on so many different levels that you can definitely watch it twice and you can definitely watch the drink-driving scene over and over. It's hilarious!

Recommended - 5 Stars.",1351036800,3,1067,4.461538461538462
4678305,4,B005FITIK0,"I just got pinged by Amazon - a web site in which you might be familiar - that recommended the movie ""Young Adult,"" most likely based upon my previous ratings.  Well, I've already seen it and I really liked it.  So to Amazon I would say, ""Better late than never"" but it made me want to rate it.

Now, Charlize Theron is not just another pretty face.  She proves that over and over, and if you disagree with me, just watch ""Monster.""  (Yikes.  While her performance was maybe too good in that film since she was the spitting image of the serial killer she played, she surely couldn't be called ""attractive"" in that film.  Must have required some great makeup work and incredible acting.  A big recommendation by me on that film as well, however.)  But in real life, if you took Ms. Theron's looks away she would still get work, and that's what I would call an actress.

But she also has terrific range.  ""Devil's Advocate,"" where she plays the confused housewife where her life is falling apart.  ""Monster,"" just mentioned.  ""Hancock,"" where her performance - and the movie itself - was highly underrated.  ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" where she played the meanest person in history.  And then ""Young Adult,"" where she plays a completely unsympathetic character, but paradoxically one that you still care about for some reason.  (Can't quite explain why or how this is possible, but it just is.  At least to me.  Maybe it was her acting?  Maybe it was because she gets humiliated at one point and you understand her pain?  Who knows?)

Now, we haven't even talked about Patton Oswalt yet.  He is pitch-perfect here, a guy that for some reason understands the Ms. Theron character, and maybe even cares about her.  Perhaps he's looking at it from the same perspective as the audience?  Maybe he's just looking for someone to hang out with and drink home-grown whiskey?

A pretty big recommendation from me on ""Young Adult.""  But then again, can you ever go wrong watching a Theron film?",1348617600,5,1986,4.667630057803469
4678306,4,B005FITIK0,"Diablo cody had written another fine script after ""Juno"" supported by the assured direction of Jason Reitman and a superb
Charliz Theron.  Using a pass-her-prime former highschool beauty hitting career dud in Mini-Apple, returning to her small home town face-off with her past life as a vehicle, the story tells a lot about life, choices made, destiny and human fragility.  Charliz Theron has firmly established herself as a solid character actor.",1348531200,,447,5.28169014084507
4678307,4,B005FITIK0,"Dynamic duo, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody, return with a vengeance with their dramatic comedy, Young Adult. Mavis (Charlize Theron), a former it girl and successful YA author, is fresh off a divorce and looking to escape her stagnant city life. She heads back to her small-town home with hopes of winning back an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). Heres the catch: hes now married and father to a newborn. So whats a successful girl to do? Throw in a home distillery, a disabled former classmate (Patton Oswalt), a manipulative plan and what do you get? A whole lot of soul-searching.

Its safe to say, I did not expect Young Adult to be what it was. From the previews I was anticipating more of a comedic romp with mild substance. Young Adult, however, is not that type of film. There are touches of comedy, sure, but its a darker humour thats inspired more by the dramatic narrative than anything else. Cody (of Juno fame) is masterful at crafting a touching story and I think her writing resonates with me because she creates such amazingly relatable characters. There is a realness to them and the desperate situations in which they find themselves. These aren't your average stock characterseach one is beautiful, funny, ugly and tragic in their own way. I liked them, I hated them and empathized with them all and thats what made this movie so damn memorable.

Lets start with Mavis. Mavis was that perfect girl in high school, you know the typethe one that all the guys wanted to be with and all the girls wanted to be. Like, gag me with a spoon! Yeah. To the townies shes seen as this successful hot-shot living the royal life in the big city. But almost immediately we learn that appearances aren't always what they seem. Mavis has become a neurotic egoist struggling to cope with a crumbling life and dwindling fame. She lacks any sort of moral compass and she quickly crosses the line into shallow territory when she plots stealing her ex away. It quickly becomes clear that Mavis has some serious personal issues. First, can I just sayCharlize Theron has totally outdone herself and created nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece playing the anti-heroine. Theron is brilliant at bringing both the depth and range needed to play such a messed up individual. Not many people could pull off this type of role so successfully. The subtle nuances of her performance had me completely riveted and still rooting for Mavis despite how unlikable she really is.

Now enter, Matt, the only seemingly reasonable person that Mavis hooks up with while visiting her hometown. In high school he was bullied and abused by people in the popular crowd, and though still bitter, manages to have a firm hold on who he is and what he wants. He is the only one whos not blinded by Mavis fame and doesnt hold back when trying to bring her back down to reality. In short, its hard not to feel sorry for Matt. Hes a pawn that people push around both physically and emotionally and he bears the scars to prove it. Mavis uses him for her own selfish reasons, yet you admire the sense of inner strength hes gained because of it. Hes somewhat of a dorky character who carries his own personal demons but is altogether still loveable. Oswalt did a phenomenal job conveying the loneliness and wit needed for such a role. Hes the most likable person in the entire movie and I spent the whole time wishing I could give him a big ol bear hug.

So I won't spoil the ending, but believe me, it left me wonderingdo people ever really change? Were not necessarily given the happiest of conclusions but at least its a brutally honest one. Reitman, once again, has done wonders at making supremely complicated people seem so utterly fascinating with appropriately timed comedy and engaging dialogue. Hes given us a film that enables us to look deep within ourselves and question our own intentions as well as the intentions of the characters on screen. Mavis isn't always likable and that's the beauty of the film. Upon face value we see a pretty perfect life but by the end of the movie we know it's what's below the surface that countsand that right there, folks, makes for an incredibly grown-up notion indeed.

Food for Thought: Young Adult, is at its core, a story about peopleone that is wonderfully written and brilliantly delivered. If you're looking for a movie that generates some serious self-reflection youve come to the right place. Much like Reitman and Codys former hit, Juno, this movie is definitely a thinker. Highest of accolades to Theron and Oswalt for their stellar performances!

4678312,5,B005FITIK0,"As always, Charlize Theron, is great in this film...she depicts the typical 30-something generation today, who are in a state of arrested development. I know more ppl like her, in just observing, who are reality-show-wannabes than care to know about. It's in the media, everywhere, the Kardashians, to name one, as their role models.  In the film, the 'happy' ppl of her home town, can't relate to her search for something that is no longer there: her lost youth as the popular, beautiful girl in school. Trying to replicate that same feeling about herself by going back to reclaim her high school boyfriend is just a symptom of her desperate effort to recapture herself when she was her 'best.' This may or not be described as a comedy, but it definitely is not. This movie takes a serious look at how painful it can be to avoid growing up.",1345939200,3,841,4.644295302013423

4678324,5,B005FITIK0,"Judging from the bad reviews, people went in expecting ""Bridesmaids"" and instead got ""There Will Be Blood"".  Looks like the marketing dept failed, yet again, by portraying a movie as something it's not.  They sell a movie like it's a mainstream popcorn flick to get the butts in the seats, but then many of those butts are understandably pissed that it's not the formulaic comfortable feel-good comedy they were looking for.  This backfires because it creates instant bad word of mouth, rather than the slow, building, good word of mouth that happens when a film isn't hyped the wrong way and is allowed to find its audience.  So sad that the movie business just can't work that way anymore.  If ""Chinatown"" had come out now, the idiots in the marketing dept would have tried to make the commercials look like ""Basic Instinct.""  Fools.  As far as the movie goes, it's spectacular. It's a beautiful, dark, little character study.  And I HATED ""Juno"" and wasn't expecting much from this but was so happily surprised.  Give it a fair chance. Keep in mind that it's not a raunchy, uproarious comedy, and that if you're in the wrong mood the movie can be depressing.

So first of, Charlize Theron's character is an absolute psychotic home-wrecking bitch who you have no sympathy for for the whole movie, not even at the end because she learns NOTHING.  Honestly, people who are trying to justify this character's 'development' are seriously kidding themselves, she's an awful person and stays that way, however in the end she realizes that she needs to just live her life and 'grow up', yet she shows no signs of any progress...to put it simply, this movie is no more entertaining than watching paint dry.  The plot goes nowhere, there is no climax or character development.  And the lack of music in the majority of the scenes is awkward and adds a serious tone to almost every scene, the preview for this movie was very deceiving.  All in all, the movie blows, you stick around waiting for it to get better but then it ends and you sit there wondering how they could make such a crappy movie with really great actors and a good team of film makers/writers behind it...",1344988800,3,1207,4.647887323943662

Okay, that's about all the positive I can generate.  The movie is a study of Theron's character, but it's a two dimensional, unsympathetic character who has no arc.  She's unlikable throughout and only comes to discover she's shallow and pathetic, without leading to any resolution.  My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to get good, until the credits started rolling and we realized we were out of luck.

When she receives an email birth announcement from her ex-boyfriend , who is now married, she decides on a whim to go back to her small hometown, naively thinking she can win him back.  She misinterpret's her ex-boyfriend's interest in catching up with her, imagining somehow that he will divorce his wife and that they will resume where they left off, as if they were characters in one of her novels.

Oswalt is the one person who Theron can really be herself with, and I loved this movie as a result of not only her actions but her relationship with him.  Her final acceptance of him really.  I relate to Theron's character on a personal level so perhaps that kinship is a major part of why I give this movie such high praise-I identified- but on so many levels it shows the aftermath of being hung up on popularity, beauty and the arrogance that comes with not understanding the reality that life is more than just being part of the ""in"" scene.

Theron's (and Cody's) rendering of Gatsby is genuinely deranged, and visibly so set in contrast with surroundings from even the first not-glamorous-at-all McDonald's French Fry.  The driving obsession isn't a positive driving character trait, it's a near-fatal flaw.  And while it feels mostly more honest, heartfelt, and creative than Cody's other work (Juno, Jennifer's Body), 90 minutes of scathingly bitter introspection is a bit rough on the system.

Reitman teams up again with Diablo Cody to create Mavis Gary ( Charlize Theron) who has never matured beyond the high school prom queen days. At 37. she is divorced, an alcoholic, a ghost writer for adult fiction series Waverly Prep, which is soon to be cancelled. Still Mavis thinks she has got it all and return to Mercury, Wisconsin to bring back her ex flame Buddy ( Patrick Wilson), who is now happily married and a father. After some awkward moments, the final embarrassment for Mavis come at the baby naming party. This film makes you feel bad and does offer hope, halfhearted at best at the end. Charlize Theron takes on her role to a new level and it is nice to see in form after Monster. What works in the film is the capturing of small town America and its people who seem to idolize Mavis because they think she has made it and the unexpected friendship that develops between Mavis and Matt ( Patton Oswalt), a former schoolmate and the victim of a hate crime. The film is lacking somehow in the writing department but has the mood and the story to make it watchable. 4 stars 4/25/2012",1337472000,,1275,4.4297872340425535

4678395,1,B005FITIK0,"I was looking forward to watching this movie, but when it was over my wife and I mutually went ""That stunk"".

Great acting and all the characters were very believable, but the story was non existent, to say the least.

I am stunned someone funded this movie. I am sure it was funded knowing enough movie goers will be tricked (duped) into watching it that it may make enough $$$ to pay for itself (I hope it does not, I hope some company has a loss on their hands). Patton did a great job, I hope at least he gets some credit and recognition as well as a few other actors. But the ""It must be decent because Theron is in it"" sucked me in and burnt me bad. Wow, that was a rip off... So many good movies to watch, and this was not one of them.

I figured the trailer moments were a tease of the fun it would be to watch, but the reality is if you take the few good scene's there are, and combine them together, all you have IS the trailer. That's it, this movie could be summed up by the trailer, as the rest was terrible fill...

This was a very well acted and well filmed terrible movie. I felt like I was watching a homework project, but that would be an insult to a homework project! Not the worst movie I have EVER seen, but I will not be duped to watch movies because they have an actor I like in it. Thank goodness I only wasted $1.25 at Redbox... Major reminder to read reviews no matter who is in the movie. The saying ""_______ has never made a bad movie"" is no longer true for Theron. I am no expert but this must now be one of her worst movies.",1337299200,4,1554,4.019417475728155

4678397,5,B005FITIK0,"I'm going to the matresses for ""Young Adult"".  I don't understand the plethora of negative reaction to it.  This is one of the best movies of last year.  Mavis Gary(Charlize Theron) is a thirty-seven year old writer of unfashionable teen fiction who emotionally hasn't escaped high school which kind of explains her occupation of choice.  She receives an e-mail from her high school beau, Buddy(Patrick Wilson), announcing the birth of his child.  Mavis surmises that Buddy wants to rekindle their former flame even though he is married with a newborn.  Is she on to something or deluded?  Regardless she hightails it to the Minneapolis suburb she grew up in to reunite with Buddy.  While there she encounters Matt(Patton Oswalt), a gnomish man who was crippled by some jocks in high school and scarred for life, who she didn't give the time of day.  During this visit Matt serves as the unlikely conscience and confidante to Mavis.  Theron is nothing short of stupendous here.  She conveys the complexities of Mavis-the narcissism, the vanity, the self-hatred, and the depressiveness.  Oswalt is every bit Theron's equal giving depth to what could have been a cliched character.  One of the more tender scenes I've seen in years is one towards the end of the film between Mavis and Matt.  Jason Reitman is proving with this and previous work to be a humanistic director.  Diablo Cody is also one of the better scribes as she crafts a script here that is colorfully detailed and nuanced.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Mavis is at a bookstore attempting to sign one of her books designated for clearance.  The bookseller exhorts her not to because he tells her they can't return damaged merchandise to the publisher.  I think the film failed to find it's audience because it was promoted as straight comedy when in reality it is drama with comedic elements.  I think, too, that even though you're not supposed to like Mavis the makers of ""Young Adult"" take the leap that you will at least sympathize with her.",1337126400,8,2027,4.80635838150289

4678403,4,B005FITIK0,"It amazed me to see so many 1-star reviews for this film, so I thought I'd offer my two cents worth. ""Young Adult"" is not a rom-com. It's a cruel dark look at the life of an emotionally fractured person (Charlize Theron) who thought she had it all figured out in high school, only to be confronted with real life after graduation. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but I will mention how heartbreaking it is to watch a person struggle beyond her means to even comfort herself. There is no transformation, no salvation, things do not get better. It is not hopeful, and does not pretend to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Letting you off the hook at the end would insult the viewers as much as it would insult the honesty of the form in which the characters were written.

If you want to be entertained, anything Jennifer Anniston has produced would be able to amuse you without altering your sensibilities. However, if you want to see what happened to the prom queen and are prepared to watch a film that has the potential for testing your emotional response, you've come to the right place.

Bottom line: This film is unconventional and defies strict genre classification; it is not just a `black comedy', it is a `black comedy spending the holidays alone'. Having stated that, no film-lover should miss the performance Theron delivers, as well as the supporting cast - Patrick Wilson & Patton Oswalt.",1336348800,17,1414,4.607142857142857

How anyone could find this funny, when she so obviously is mentally ill? Drinking to excess and obsessively pulling out her hair while ignoring reality, she enters the story a shallow self-involved bitch, and despite touching some humanity, exits in the same condition.

4678458,3,B005FITIK0,"Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a 37 year old author of teen books for young adults. She has been relatively successful but she is faced with writing the last book of the series which spells the end of her writing career as she has experienced it. Most of the books have been a mixture of her past high school glory days modernized on the lingo and ideas she picks up while out in public around younger people.

She gets an email from the wife of her old boyfriend in college about the birth of their new baby. She is filled with jealousy and a sense of loss over what might have happened if she had stayed with her old love and married him. Her divorced life and one night pick up dates seems to be a sad comparison to the possible joy she might have had if her and Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) had gotten married.

She jumps out of bed from a one night stand and drives back to her old town to get Buddy back and show him what life with her could really be like if he left his wife and child...

This is a sad and dark story about an alcoholic middle aged woman who is deeply depressed and she doesn't know how to go on with her life. She wants to relive the glory days of her teen and college years to regain the joys of living. This movie is extremely well acted and Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt who portrays Matt Freehauf do a wonderful job of acting the roles of middle age people still stuck in their younger years.

What kills this movie is that it is just such a depressing storyline. There are some parts that are a comedy and Charlize is as hot as usual but the storyline is just downright gloomy about how people can be so miserable with their lives.

4678464,3,B005FITIK0,"[Spoiler alert] This was a tough watch. I expected anti-hero dark comedy, but it's far more dark than comedy. Sure, we're given plenty of the 'oblivious beauty queen in state of painfully arrested development.' It was fun watching her attempts to skew reality in the way that best suited her needs; that's the defining trait of the Mean Girls, after all. Then the pity happens. We see that she's seriously broken under there, and we're expected to feel bad for her. Poor, sad drunk pretty girl. And just when she seems to be at the brink of a genuine breakthrough, she hops back into her broken life and drives away.

While I admit that a magical Romey & Michelle redemption for Mavis would have infuriated me, it would've been nice to see that she learned even the slightest bit from her escapade. But the fact is, some people simply don't learn. They peak at 17, then face 60 long years of mediocrity. That's an ugly truth. Some people have their lives utterly ruined at 17 and never quite get over it, and that is also true. So don't expect a quippy, quirky, long overdue hair-pulling for the mean girl 'cause this ain't it.  DO, however, look for brilliant and nuanced performances from both Theron and Oswalt.

Whether Mavis is not talking to her publisher or watching E!, her life seems like it's going nowhere until she gets a surprise email from a former flame. She goes through the trials and tribulations thinking she still has a chance with her ex flame. On a whim, she decides to go to Mercury, Minnesota, her hometown, to visit Buddy Slade (played by Patrick Wilson). In Mercury, she realizes that nothing has changed, whether going to KFC or Pizza Hut to grab some food, which by the way she eats a lot of in the movie. On a night out to the bar, she meets Matt Freehauf (played by Patton Oswalt), whom she remembers as the ""Hate Crime Guy"", who was never gay and is mentioned a few more times in the movie. After Mavis and Matt have a few drinks, Mavis spills the beans about going to Buddy's house and trying to win him back. Matt tells her that he is in a happy place now with his wife and baby. After many close attempts with Buddy, it is clear that he is with the woman who makes his life complete, his wife. After a huge mess-up at the baby's naming ceremony, Mavis goes back to Matt's house as they lay and cuddle on Matt's bed. In the end, Mavis knew that whatever happiness she had lies within herself, no matter what anybody else thinks. She packs up her bags and heads back home and live the life she has been living.

A brief history of the film's director and writer of the movie, Young Adult.
Jason Reitman, the film's director, has directed the films Juno and Up in the Air (which is one of my all-time favorites). Jason is the son of Ivan Reitman, who you may know as the director of such classics like Stripes, Meatballs and Ghostbusters. Jason grew up in Canada admiring his dad's movies and wanted to become a director like his father. He went on to major Creative Writing at USC. His first effort into filmmaking came into full effect with Thank You For Smoking, which starred Aaron Eckhart and Katie Holmes. Juno followed, as well as Up in the Air, and now Young Adult.

Diablo Cody has had a whirlwind of a few years, not only she won an Academy Award for best screenplay for Juno, but she has been the go-to writer of the moment. Cody, whose real name is Brook Busey, went into Media Studies at the University of Iowa and later began writing for City Pages, a weekly newspaper. After City Pages, she wrote her memoir, ""Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper."" A producer who read her book wanted Cody to her first screenplay, which would be Juno. Cody has then written movies such as Jennifer's Body, horror movie, and now Young Adult.

The movie is now on DVD and Blu-Ray. The only features on the DVD include commentaries by the filmmakers. Rated R for Language. Starring Charlize Theron, Patton Oswalt, and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Jason Reitman. Written by Diablo Cody. Produced by Reitman, Cody, Mason Novick, Lianne Halfon, and Russell Smith. Cinematography by Eric Steelberg.",1332892800,2,3055,4.500900900900901

Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt don't just give good performances, they give legendary performances.  I am talking like Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.

Charlize Theron is the greatest actress of all time.  I mean since the art of acting was like invented.

4678499,4,B005FITIK0,"Charlize Theron is a young adult fiction writer. In the first few minutes of the movie, her character is ingeniously established by showing us glimpses of her morning routine. She has an idea to return to her small hometown in Mercury, Minn. to rekindle a romance with a man who is happily married with a baby. Theron was fantastic in her role. She meets an old friend Matt (Patton Oswalt) who she remembers as ""the hate crime kid"" because a group of jocks beat him up believing he was gay. The only thing that was hit harder was Theron's liver who is an excessive drinker.

The irony of the film is that Theron is trapped by her own life, but doesn't realize it. She in turn believes ex-bf Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) is the one who is trapped because he is married and is saddled with a kid. Theron projects herself into the main character of her current novel. She has been influenced by the romance authors where the two people who were meant for each other come together in the end although such is not the case in life.

The script is as predictable as a low budget Indie. My biggest problem is that the film drops off too much after the climax scene. It needed about 5-10 more minutes to have given it proper closure. I will say it again. Theron was great.

4678501,4,B005FITIK0,"As young people flock to line up for such films as `The Hunger Game' opening, attempting to get a view of how rage is OK under given circumstances, along comes another little film from the pen of Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer's Body, United States of Tara) and under the direction of Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Thank you for Smoking) that is so unsettling in its message that it makes other make-believe story movies pale in comparison. Add to this combination an actress of the caliber of Charlize Theron and you end up with one disturbing but excellent film.

Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), left her high school popularity in Mercury, MN to move on to Minneapolis to become a famous ghost writer of Young Adult romances.  Now age (she is now 37 years old), bad divorce, writer's block and alcoholism force her to stare in the mirror, see how she has slipped, and respond to an email birth announcement of a child born to her ex-flame Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) by deciding to return to Mercury and reignite her old passion for the now happily married Buddy.  She crams her tiny pet dog into her carryon, registers at the local motel (the desk is manned by a shrewd Louisa Krause), and is off to find a drink.  She there encounters Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt in a brilliant performance), a high school nobody who suffered massive physical abuse and subsequent permanent damage at the hands of jocks who beat him brutally for being gay (he isn't).  Mavis recognizes Matt, feels sorry for him, and confides in him that she is in town to rekindle her old romance with Buddy.  Despite Matt's warnings that Buddy is off limits Mavis, between bouts of drunken oblivion, fixes her appearance, makes contact with Buddy, is invited to Buddy's home to meet his wife Beth (Elisabeth Reaser) and new daughter, all the while focusing her wiles on seducing Buddy despite all evidence that the affair is dead. She eventually makes a fool of herself and finds her only solace is in Matt and Matt's very plain and bored sister Sandra (Collette Wolfe).  How the trip to Mercury ends is the surprising finale.

Charlize Theron is such a fine actress that she is able to find crevices where we can peak into her life and find some love for her despicably ruined Mavis. The entire cast is excellent and includes cameos by Mary Beth Hurt and Jill Eikenberry.  Once again Diablo Cody invites us to look at just what defines `adult' and why so many people stumble on their way to that plateau. At times it is difficult to see the comedy in this film, but stand far enough back and it is the human comedy that we are watching.  Cody, with Reitman, makes that clear.

4678518,4,B005FITIK0,"""Young Adult"" is a comedy drama, but being directed by Jason Reitman - known for ""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" - it is not just an ordinary comedy. With Diablo Cody (who wrote for ""Juno"" in 2007) as a writer, the director shows us life's uncomfortable little truths in a comical, but somewhat disturbing way. To say people don't change is pretty easy, but to watch it on screen is not very comfortable, even though wrapped up in comical dark humor.

Meet Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), a 37-year-old writer (actually a ghost writer) of young adult novels living in a small Minneapolis apartment room with a Pomeranian. Obviously things are not going well for her as the YA series she has been ghostwriting is about to be cancelled.

One day she receives an e-mail from Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), her ex-boyfriend now happily married in Mercury, Minnesota, where Mavis came from. And to the e-mail is attached a photo of his newborn daughter. Something deep inside her prompts her to travel back to the place she had left years ago, just to win back her former boyfriend ... or perhaps something else she does not know.

The story revolves around a person you may find unpleasant. If you think Julia Roberts' character in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" unpleasant, you may find Mavis ten times more so. Self-absorbed Mavis (listening to an old cassette tape again and again) is a kind of person who never grows up. And if she does, she does it with a price to pay.

But somehow I couldn't hate Mavis, mainly because of Charlize Theron's superb performance as Mavis, which is the driving force of the comedy that is always bitter and often dark. What she does is, you may find, either hilarious or annoying (or most likely, both), but her portrayal is very real, which will make some audience feel as if looking into a mirror. Patton Oswalt is also wonderful as Matt, who went to the same high school as Mavis (but she hardly remembers anything about him). The interaction between Mavis and Matt (who has a few things to say to Mavis) is one of the best moments of the film.

This is not a film that everyone would enjoy watching, but still proves that Jason Reitman is one of the best directors of his generation.",1332374400,3,2231,4.5954773869346734

It's a movie about the following cultural clashes:
(1) anonymous urbanity versus small town reputation;
(2) high-achieving individualism versus comfort-seeking community life;
(3)needs-fulfillment versus love-and-sacrifice.

The movie initially paints a bleak picture of contemporary urban individualism; returning to her home town makes her appear shallow. But ultimately she realizes that she can't live like them because she is better than them.

Movies that appear similar in the trailer (like Sweet Home Alabama) usually conclude that traditional community life is The Good Life. This movie reaches exactly the opposite conclusion.

If you're expecting big laughs, you'll be sorely disappointed since the only comedy here is pretty dark and often cringe-worthy when it arrives. The pathetic nature of the main character and her alcoholic binges make it hard to connect with her since she's routinely narcissistic, spoiled and just plain unlikable all at the same time.

But while it doesn't deliver on the comedy front, it's actually a clever and complex observation of a thirty-something trapped in her high school years who just never became an adult. Her practical stalking of an old flame is believable and oddly touching despite being completely inappropriate, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion that fits the setup. The whole thing works because of Patton Oswalt's character who is also stuck in his life because of events at high school but helps lift the otherwise melancholic tone.

I think most people will either love this or hate it. It's different to Reitman's other films such as Up in the Air but the same in that there's an undercurrent of malaise, frustration and boredom in his version of American culture. It's an uneasy film to watch but it's also smart enough to make the audience think - if you can get passed the inherent bleakness.",1332115200,8,1325,4.832599118942731

I don't want to say it was a train-wreck, because that's just too obvious, given that the plot is about a woman who was a trainwreck. Charlize deserves as many awards for this as she does for her other transformative roles, like Monster, and I am on the verge of saying I liked this movie and doing the whole Facebook ""thumbs-up"" routine, but this film distinctly felt like a terrible movie surrounding a hypnotic performance. It is a very detailed character study, much like the film ""Terri,"" and I am sure it will get recognized more than Terri, but the empathy I had for the characters in Terri, I could not quite muster-up for the Young Adult characters. I wanted to laugh more, but the funny angles were all smothered in a sort of uneasiness. I don't think I will be able to fully make up my mind until I see it again, and it was prickly enough the first time, so that might not happen. Regardless, Charlize carried the movie, with a little help from Patton Oswald's less-believable supporting role.

There were MANY scenes that were highly relatable to my own personal and professional life (from drinking excessive amounts of diet pop to wearing hello kitty pjs).

Is Mavis self-indulgent, self-absorbed and at times pathetically out-of-touch? Yes. But she's also lost and lonely and searching for meaning.

With more and more twentysomethings living at home, more adults waiting longer to marry and more people having trouble finding fulfilling relationships, Mavis is an emblem for the ""young adult."" Along the way, she finds Patton Oswalt's character who is also trapped in YA world because of a brutal attack long ago. They've both arrived at the same place and are stuck.

4678567,4,B005FITIK0,"Charlize Theron is a phenomenal actress and gives a captivating performance as Mavis - a sort of female Patrick Bateman without the violence, a product of the same ""pursuit of loneliness"".  But unlike the American Psycho, this character is somewhat unusual in that she is emotionally intelligent while being morally vapid and that complexity shows the brilliance of the writing.  Plenty of characters are intellectually vapid and morally vapid, or even intelligent but emotionally vapid and morally bankrupt like Patrick Bateman, but it's rare to see a character portrayed with such a high humanistic i.q. and so fatally foolish.  It's as if screenwriters can't imagine one of their own being such a source of dysfunction and a reminder that all the knowledge in the world will never take the place of heart.

Good supporting cast, Wilson, who doesn't break new ground but serves the role, and Oswalt, who once again seems to play himself, not that that's bad, it seems to suit him best as his professional choice of comic requires him to craft his personality into something stage-worthy.  And not that it's a contrivance, but a dedication to connect with the truth of his real life ""character"" to the extent that it's possible to plug ""Patton"" into movies without having to create a new character, i.e., his stand up persona, his role in ""Big Fan"" and this role aren't different people, and he's entertaining in all three.

Young Adult is the quintessential protagonist is more antagonistic than not, fatalistic yet enlightening, and evidence that Reitman and Cody are the go-to production team for dark-comedy dramas.  The dark is the spiritual doom, the comedy is the mesmerizing juxtaposition of realism and contrivance in a character walking around in an emotional coma where people who would help, can't reach her, and the drama is the intellectually and physically overgrown teenager dealing with emotionally young adult issues.

The kitchen table scene is so good it's all time, and it's significance is indescribable, and in that, demonstrates the need for cinema.  Theron does more with facial expressions in that scene than some movie stars will achieve in their whole career, and represents what professionalism looks like when someone is at the top of their game as opposed to early career success or a big break.

A note about black comedies - they are as hardcore as any movie and by digging at the core of existence they tend to be more severe than thrillers where the tone matches the content or horror movies, which are usually silly and/or nothing more than momentary shock and gore.  Black comedies usually don't elicit out loud laughs, but then, I never thought Carlin did either, and like Young Adult, he was amusing in a way that prompts you to muse, it's more of a food for thought and satisfying contemplation than an uncontrolled laugh and can be worth much more.  It is mislabeling in the sense that it's more irony than comedy, according to the definition - ""situational irony - irony involving a situation in which actions have an effect that is opposite from what was intended, so that the outcome is contrary to what was expected.""  Mavis' intention is to be liked, but it's the young adult version of that, to be popular, and she gets the opposite of what she expected.  It worked then, everyone else moved on, grew up, and it doesn't work now, she alienates when her perverted intention was to gain acceptance.  The black of the comedy is that she's not adult enough to admit her need of others, to herself.

Theron's performance is one of the more brilliant in recent memory along with Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground, Pitt in Moneyball, Shannon in Take Shelter and the entire cast of Animal Kingdom, all of whom give powerful performances without an ounce of over-acting.
Theron deserves an award for Young Adult more than she did for Monster.",1331942400,,3877,4.89618320610687

I really tried to like it but the creepiness of the character and the lack of laughs just made this movie painful to watch.  I went into it with high hopes of finding a funny character with all the neurotic quirks that are unique to writers.  In fact, the only redeeming part of the movie would be recognized by writers is when Charlize Theron's character starts exhibiting writer's block near the beginning of the film and finds herself unconsciously looking for distraction to avoid writing her daily quota of words and/or pages.

I have to wonder if the critics who professed to love this movie only wrote the reviews out of kindness to Theron in a failed attempt to gain her attention as if they were back in high school and she was the popular girl that batted her eyes at them, leading them on but only because she wanted something that only they could provide, and discarding them back into the Dungeon of Dorks as soon as she got it.

4678571,5,B005FITIK0,"Mavis Gary is a mess.  She is permanently sixteen.  She drinks herself to sleep while watching the Kardashian empire grow and she walks around oblivious to her own obscurity by convincing herself that she's somehow important.  She escaped small down life by moving to the Mini-Apple and she's never looked back once.  She writes a `dead in the water' YA series that is rounding the corner of completion and she thinks anything that isn't manufactured by media propaganda is `gross'.  She leans on her own crutch, a crutch created by a self-loathing she won't confront and enabled by those who loath themselves and will admit it (the little people are obsessed with her).  Like I said, she's a mess.

In `Young Adult', former stripper and Oscar winner Diablo Cody crafts a sharply focused dissection of a woman who refused to grow up and who insists that she's above everyone else.

`Young Adult' is a simple prose.  Mavis finds out that her high school sweetheart has become a new father just as she is being hit with her deadline for her final book.  Suffering from severe writer's block she heads to her home town to see the new baby and hopefully steal her ex back from his wife.  In the process she reconnects with an equally lost soul who becomes a voice of reason to the misguided Mavis.

If only she'd listen.

There is no fat here.  This film is sharp and to the point and just `gets it'.  Charlize is hilarious yet with a purpose.  You can see the dramatic weight of her past life haunting her current motives.  She nails this performance; possibly the best of her career.  Comedian Patton Oswalt is also flawless here.  The way that he embodies his character, Matt, with the right amount of self-pity is brilliantly colored.  He's believable; sad and lonely yet seemingly stable.  Yet again, Patrick Wilson is nothing more than a pretty prop (does NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD RESPECT HIS OBVIOUS TALENT?????) but it doesn't fault the film since he needed to be that in order for this to work.

4678573,5,B005FITIK0,"Mavis Gary is the ghostwriter for a fading series of Y.A. novels.  Aware of the depression she is sinking into (but not exactly of how far into it she's already gone), Mavis thinks of the happiest time of her life: when she was in high school, dating the popular boy, Buddy Slade.  Despite the fact that Buddy has a wife and new child, Mavis heads back to the small town of Mercury to reclaim the lost days of her youth.

It's a basic, even boring premise, yet Jason Reitman's YOUNG ADULT captures the complexities of depression/self-discovery perfectly, ripe with all the awkward moments, self-loathing, and even humor that goes along with it.  To call YOUNG ADULT a comedy would be doing it a disservice, as it is far more than that: it's an intricate, layered character study, anchored by Charlize Theron's lead performance.  That Theron wasn't even nominated for a Best Actress Oscar is almost a tragedy; the same can be said for Patton Oswalt, who goes from stand-up comedic to dramatic actor as the flip-side of Mavis: a kid who was largely ignored, even picked on, with tragic results.  Theron and Oswalt give deep, mesmerizing performances; also strong are Patrick Wilson (a grossly-underused actor) as Buddy, and Elizabeth Reaser as his wife.  Reitman, as usual, handles his actors perfectly, working from another solid script by Diablo Cody.  This is the team that brought you JUNO, yes, but this is definitely a film for adults--for only adults can know the pain of discovering that who you see when you look in the mirror is only a glimmer of who you are.  Uncomfortable at times, hilarious at others, YOUNG ADULT is not a film to be missed, under any circumstances.",1331769600,,1678,4.778546712802768
4678574,5,B005FITIK0,"The movie advertised as a comedy, but throughout the movie, there were, if at all, very few moments that made me laugh. I was never a fan of Charlize Theron, because I thought she was just your stereotypical, pretty faced actress, but I am a fan now. Her acting is great, and the movie was greatly cast. As for the movie, the one word that I can describe Young Adult is: ""realistic"". There's nothing dramatized here, nothing romanticized: we have Mavis (Theron) who hasn't grown up, and is stuck in denial and refuses to believe that she is a failed ""author"". In short, it's a story about a middle aged (possibly mentally insane)woman who hasn't grown up, and makes horrible choices trying to win back her married, high school sweetheart. Then at the end, when she realizes her mistakes, she learns from them and finally transitions from being a young adult to an empathetic, functioning adult.... well, that's where the tragedy sinks in. You root for her to change, to grow up, and to become a better person. But one conversation in the end makes her relapse, and makes us viewers want to smack her in the head, and proclaim that this was a bad movie. But it is because of this, it was a great movie for me. Like I said, if you are expecting comedy, don't watch Young Adult. But if you want to see a ""realistic tragedy"", that is somehow very refreshing (if that's the right word) watch this movie.",1331769600,2,1398,4.529644268774703
4678575,4,B005FITIK0,"Charlize Theron plays the character of Mavis as if she was taken from a bad Katherine Heigl Rom-Com and thrust into the real world.  Jason Reitrman and Diablo Cody have crafted a film that deceives the viewer by challenging film conventions, and that's a compliment.

Theron's character travels back to her hometown in hopes of hooking up with an old flame, Buddy.  Throughout the entire film, she is self absorbed, and delusional as if this is meant to be.  What makes the film compelling is that if this was any other film, her character would either wind up with the guy or learn some lesson and wind up with an equally handsome great guy.  Yet, as in all of Reitman's work, Mavis is incredibly flawed and a happy ending isn't easily achieved.  What happen's is surprising and the ending isn't neccessarily fullfilling depending on how you view it.  Personally, I think it's fitting.

While Theron is impressive, Patton Oswalt is equally good as a voice of reason for Mavis.  He plays one of her former classmates who was clearly unpopular and not even a footnote in Mavis's life, despite having a locker next to her.  Like Mavis, he's still somewhat trapped in the past, though for entirely different, shocking reasons.  The Reitman/Cody character study culminates in a great scene between Theron and Oswalt that almost literally strips the characters of any pretense, displaying both at their most vulnerable.

This movie is not for everyone, and people seem to love it or hate it.  It has some light touches of comedy but by most counts, it's very clearly a drama.  Like all of Reitman's films, I wanted to pick this one up again and rewatch it.  Do not, however, expect a feel good movie.",1331769600,,1695,4.737201365187714

That being said this movie was good to see, it certainly was different, then say Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, but Romy and Michelle was funny and has rewatchability. This movie I would not need to see again, because the drama is just so cringeworthy.
Charlize Theron plays this part well, although it just seemed too easy for her to project, maybe she knows what its like to be popular and fawned over for her looks.
This movie actually earns an extra star because of Patton Oswalt! Who knew Patton could be so heartbreakingly good, and every part of it was believable, especially the scene where he has to take his shirt off and he crosses his arms.
All in all I wouldnt recommend this film for the casual moviegoer, only people who can appreciate subtlety, a dark film, and maybe Patton Oswalt fans (but certainly not for Ratatouille)",1331769600,,1076,4.7287234042553195

I thought the plot was very interesting and there wasn't a dull moment throughout the movie. Charlize Theron was both excellent and stunning throughout the movie. She played this role to near perfection and was very believable. She is also a perfect example of getting better with age. Absolutely beautiful!

After Thank You for Smoking in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn't a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart, instead reconnecting with a former classmate she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love. Some have speculated that audiences didn't quite know how to respond to the film's bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others. At the end of the day, Theron's performance is outstanding and that the story is both funny and powerful enough in its examination of prolonged adolescence to warrant a watch.",1331596800,,999,5.0606060606060606

Charlize Theron inhabits the role of Mavis Gary so completely that it is hard to imagine that she is not that person.

We slowly come to see what her vulnerabilities are.  As a ""ghost"" writer of a YA series that is about to end unsuccessfully, it is no surprise that she seeks out her former glory days.  High school was the pinnacle for her, and her former boyfriend (played by Patrick Wilson) becomes an obsession.

The Film 4.5/5

Jason Reitman's first full-length feature was Thank You for Smoking and he followed it with Juno and Up in the Air. All three films are among my favorites and I was eager to see Young Adult in theaters. I consider Juno and Up in the Air to be just about perfect, so expectations were sky high.

Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her Juno screenplay, but Young Adult is very different in tone. Juno MacGuff was extremely likable, but Mavis Gary (Theron) is anything but. She's selfish and doesn't consider anyone worthy of her time. She barely functions as an adult and is in all likelihood an alcoholic. The title refers to the fiction she writes for the teen market, but her series has run its course and she's writing the final installment.

When she receives an email showing that her ex-boyfriend, Buddy (Wilson), is married and has recently become a father, all she can think about is going to her old home town to win him back. The fact that he is happily married is a minor convenience. After all, she has baggage too.

Mavis makes the trip back to Mercury, Minnesota and calls Buddy. They arrange to meet the following evening so she visits a bar on her own the first night she's in town. It's there that she runs into Matt Freehauf (Oswalt), who had the locker next to her in high school. He was the victim of a hate crime in school because a group of thugs thought he was gay. It turns out that he wasn't, but it's left him unable to walk without using a crutch.

Matt becomes an outlet for Mavis and he's used as a device to show the audience how deranged Mavis really is. She's not shy about announcing her intentions to wreck Buddy's marriage and steal him away. Matt casually informs her that she's mentally ill. The two form a kind of friendship which is aided by Matt's ability to brew alcohol and her need to talk about Buddy and stay permanently drunk.

As you can tell, Young Adult isn't a typical comedy. Most romantic comedy has a likable woman pursuing a man, with the two ending up together and living happily ever after. This film is more of a character study than a traditional comedy. You'll laugh at Mavis because she's so outrageous and completely clueless about the negative impact she has on other people. You'll never really root for her, but something makes you want to see what she is going to do next.

There is some small ray of hope for Mavis at the end of the film. She may not achieve what she sets out to do, but she does have an epiphany about her depressing existence. As usual, Reitman and Cody come up with a few surprises. Whatever you think of Mavis, you'll probably agree that the film is well-made and intelligently written. Some of the observations are funny, while others are sad, but they all fit the characters and feel authentic.

Theron does a good job of appearing unlikable. We even see how Mavis transforms herself from a virtual zombie who can barely function into a woman attractive enough to get Buddy's attention. Mavis might not be a woman that you will like or recognize, but she's never boring. Oswalt's portrayal of Matt is vital and the film wouldn't work without it. He's funny, but his acting ability also gives him a convincing vulnerability. He's very honest about his flaws and he's a character that is easy to like.

On first viewing, I gave Young Adult 4/5. After two further viewings, I'll raise that to 4.5/5. It doesn't have Ellen Page or George Clooney to help place it among my absolute favorite films, but I'm very happy to own it.

The Blu-ray presentation is very good. Detail is strong and I didn't detect any weak points. The audio does exactly what it is supposed to, but the film is driven by dialogue and you won't be blown away by the sound. if you liked the film in theaters, the Blu-ray is worth picking up. With an audio commentary and more than an hour of special features, it's a good overall package.",1331424000,2,4300,4.595300261096606

4678655,4,B005FITIK0,"This movie isn't just a fascinating character study. It's a sharp and melancholy tale of lost youth and arrested development.  It also makes some subtle points about the most youth-obsessed, immature aspects of today's culture.  (It's no coincidence the main character constantly watches reality TV and writes young adult novels - there's even a veiled reference to Twilight at one point, that teen phenomenon that became curiously popular with adults.)

Enter 37-year-old Mavis, once the prettiest and most popular girl in her high school.  Years later, Mavis still has the mentality of a lazy, snotty and self-obsessed adolescent . . . along with a drinking problem, depression, anxiety, and a foundering career as fiction writer.

Mavis learns her high school boyfriend, Buddy, has had a baby with his wife.  Nostalgia for her glory days drives Mavis to hatch a ridiculous plan - return to her Minnesota hometown to ""save"" Buddy (who hasn't seen her in years) from his boring suburban existence.

Once in town, Mavis runs into sarcastic former classmate, Matt - because every queen bee needs someone to listen to her talk about herself, Mavis strikes up a sort of friendship with Matt.  Matt still lives at home, immersed in his hobbies like the lonely, unpopular teen he once was.  A  severe beating by bullies in high school left him disabled - Matt is frozen in time due to tragedy, while Mavis is stuck because she peaked in high school.  While Matt sees Mavis for the lonely mess she is, Mavis is too deluded to realize how much they have in common.

Theron and Oswalt are absolutely perfect in their roles. Mavis and Matt are extreme examples, but their malaise will strike a chord with anyone who ever struggled to become a grown-up, or wished they could recapture the promise of youth.

Word to the wise: this isn't really a comedy, though it has some brilliant moments of dialogue.",1331337600,3,1893,4.878125

4678659,4,B005FITIK0,"Matt: ""What are you doing back in Mercury? Did you move back or...""
Mavis: ""Of course not. Gross.""

Young Adult is an uncomfortable movie. It begins uncomfortably, progresses awkwardly, and ends painfully. But that's the point of Jason Reitman's film. Reitman breaks with form to create such wondrously intrusive works as Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and Up in the Air. What Reitman delivers particularly well are intriguing characters that represent moral objections to society (a cigarette ambassador, pregnant teenager, and cold-hearted corporate professional who fires people for a living), but don't necessarily learn the lesson that you'd suspect when credits roll.

Bring in Charlize Theron, a thirty-seven year old young adult novelist who's never outlived her teenage popularity bratty-queen self despite the fact that the rest of the world, two decades later, has. She's beautiful, but we can't stand her. What unfolds is a depiction of her continual efforts to remain youthful by possessing her past, yet how suddenly, and often, she comes undone to herself. How one person could be so arrogant of others happiness and their own misery baffles us. When the movies through, we like her even less. While not Reitman's greatest film, Young Adult may be the best critical commentary on the modern obsession with teenage literature, like Twilight, that I've ever seen.

4678660,1,B005FITIK0,"Went to this movie with a lot of great expectations, especially after watching Theron in an interview where she talks about doing comedy was a lot of fun.

This movie is not funny.  The subject matter is not funny.  I find it interesting when someone does comedy that most people think is not funny they call it dark humor.  This is not dark humor, it is just a dark, sad movie.  This is about watching someone who has some serious mental issues continue down a very dark road.  Near the end of the movie you find out what is the cause for the major mental issues and it is not a funny / humorous cause in any way shape or form.

At the end of the movie, there are no answers and no resolution.  You may say that is fine because that is how life can be.  This is the sad truth, which is why I go to movies so I can escape the cruel world for a couple of hours.  You will leave this movie depressed in a lot of ways.",1327795200,9,915,3.978021978021978

It's not meant to be as funny and playful at Juno, so knowing that allows an audience to better appreciate what the film was meant to offer: plenty of us try to look at our lives through the prism of how we are doing now compared to who we dreamed we might be when we were younger. Some of us never let go of how others saw us in High School, and some of us go to great lengths to escape ever thinking of those hellish four years ever again.

But what if someone never let go of being the IT girl in school? What if she began to rewrite reality to fit still being that IT girl years later? In that role Theron made believable what might have been out of reach for many other actresses: truly living in the dream world of the high school party days never ending, and the boy she loved is just a heartbeat away from leaving his child and happy marriage if that's what she asks.

It's a film to help adults let go of the past, and empowers ""Young Adults"" to see that there is life after high school, and taking High School with you is more of a burden then a benefit.",1327017600,4,1482,4.718146718146718

I didn't have any sympathy for her, I didn't relate to her. I found her to be a self-indulgent, spoiled pathetic one dimensional. What was the point of even making this visual monstrosity?

4678663,3,B005FITIK0,"I've long suspected that most Hollywood scriptwriters and directors weren't particularly popular in high school because while there's a ton of movies about outcasts, there are few from the perspective of a Queen Bee or star quarterback.  ""Young Adult,"" while it has flaws, offers a side of the story that rarely gets told in movies.

Charlize Theron plays Mavis, a thirty-something whose glory days were in high school, but who managed to escape her boring small town and move to the Big City, where she's a ghost-writer for a young adult novel series.  She's also the envy of a few of her former classmates who believe that she's living a glamorous lifestyle.  This is proven to be inaccurate within the first ten minutes of ""Young Adult,"" in which Theron wakes up from a drunken stupor and shuffles around her apartment groggily feeding her dog and other chores before logging onto her computer.  There she finds that someone's sent her a photo of a newborn whose dad is former flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  Because her life is going nowhere, she decides to return home and re-ignite her relationship with Wilson.  After a glimpse into his life of domestic bliss, anyone else would scrap this idea, but Mavis is either a sociopath, mentally ill or pathetically clueless, and besides which, if she didn't, there wouldn't be much of a movie.

Mavis' insensitivity can be summed up in her reaction to encountering an old classmate, Patton Oswalt; after hearing the details of a hate crime, which left him permanently disabled in high school, she gets a little green-eyed.  ""You must have missed so much school!"" While the movie has some very funny moments, somehow they don't add up.  This is one of those movies, where you realize that all the witticisms that work were used in the trailer.  Still, I appreciated the fact that the rivalry between Mavis and Wilson's wife, didn't disintegrate into a full-fledged cat fight involving mud wrestling and hair pulling, which is what happened in Kristen Bell's ""You Again."" Most of the characters are allowed to keep their dignity, despite the ""dullness"" of their adult lives. Oswalt's sister, however, is still sort of locked in her high school role of wannabe and pleads with Theron to take her to the city, too. ""No, you're good here,"" Theron replies, proving that she's at least learned a few things from her ordeal.",1325462400,2,2365,4.872817955112219
4678664,4,B005FITIK0,"Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody reteam (following the widely successful ""Juno"" of a few years ago) to bring us another ""slice of life"" movie.

""Young Adult"" brings the story of a mid/late 30s woman (played brilliantly by Charlize Theron) who seemingly never grew up (hence still ""young adult"") and feels and acts as if it's still high school. Her job (writing ""young adult"" books) is going nowhere either and for no good reason she decides to go back from Minneapolis to her hometown (fictional Mercury, Minnesota) to win back the love of her HS boyfriend who is now a happily married man with a baby. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Reitman and Cody do a great job bringing this intensely unlikable character in full nuance. But hats off to Charlize Theron who really outshines everyone in bringing this troubles character in a way that makes it believable and not a caricature. No, this is definitely not a ""feel good"" movie in the way ""Juno"" could be viewed, but ""Young Adult"" is very much a worthwhile movie nevertheless, and by all means Theron should pick up an Oscar nomination for her performance.",1325289600,,1147,4.73
4678695,4,B005FITIK0,"Thought I'd put in my two cents. Unlike his father, Reitman is rapidly becoming a genuine American auteur. No one working in Hollywood today gets the incipient loneliness and social malaise of post-modern America, ""How we live today,"" as it were. His last two films, this one and Up in the Air, totally nail all the odd comic elements of a society going joylessly through the motions - the sterility and formlessness of airport culture, the soulless vapidity of small town life, the weird highway ramp hotel non-culture, successful people trapped in their own self-made defensive cocoons, not to mention the perverse enjoyment of misery and depression fueled by endless booze and empty sex..Reitman is basically aiming his films at people who read things other that Twilight. He is drawn to writers like Walter Kirn and Diablo Cody because they seem to have something to say about the sad Way We Live Now that is not driven by research and age demos. The irony of Mavis, the ultimate ""hip"" urban creature, confessing that what she really wanted was to be a ""square"", and the defenses she erected to combat that failure, is the sort of irony that would make people walk out, I suppose. Give it up for Charlize, totally fearless, who gets something about the world we live in that should be explored. Like Carlin once said, ""What, are you gonna eat at Wendy's and read USA Today till the end of time???"" I also was the only one laughing at lots of the lines. So what? These folks are playing to those select move goers who are too hip for the room. Don't those moviegoers deserve a few annual gifts in a world of creeping meatballism? But don't expect too many of these types of films a year..Just be thankful when they come along...",1325116800,80,1731,4.660130718954249
4678696,3,B005FITIK0,"Your enjoyment of YOUNG ADULT will depend pretty much on how able you are to enjoy a well-acted, well-written movie that also features a thoroughly unlikeable and irredeemable lead character engaging in fairly trivial and uninteresting activities.

The excellent (at least in this film) Charlize Theron plays the lead character, a modestly successful ghost-writer of young adult novels who is nonetheless  deeply unhappy because her high school love (Patrick Wilson) is happily married to someone else (Elizabeth Reaser).  Although decades have gone by since high school, Theron is unable to shake the idea that she and Wilson belong together.  So she returns to her home town with the express purpose of seducing Wilson into realizing his mistake in marrying and to return to her.  To say that Theron is delusional is not a stretch.  I think the film wants us to see her as ""trapped in adolescence and unable to move on.""  I see her as crazy, unlikeable and unsympathetic.  She's a drunk (I'm not sure I've seen a female character more addicted to the booze since the days when Liz Taylor slung her whiskey around in VIRGINIA WOOLF) of the first order.  She's incapable of seeing true emotion in others...yet she's also almost completely non-self-aware at the same time.

During her time in town, she shares a few drinks with Patton Oswalt, a former classmate who was a victim of some SERIOUS bullying back in the day.  Oswalt is now a self-conscious nerd, with a serious limp due to a beating he received...a disability he seems to use as an excuse to hide himself from the world.  He, too, is scarred and changed by his adolescence...but he's the pitiful character, because he IS self-aware.  He's also oddly drawn to Theron, and the two develop an interesting and surprising relationship that is the best part of the film, BY FAR.  Oswalt, always a solid actor, really takes a big leap in vulnerability.  The hints of real acting chops he showed in UNITED STATES OF TARA come into full realization here.

Wilson does his patented ""handsome, slightly boring but generally agreeable guy"" character.  (See anything from LITTLE CHILDREN to LAKEVIEW TERRACE.)  He is NOT an exciting actor, and is often actively annoying (see PHANTOM OF THE OPERA...or not).  Often, he is cast opposite far more exciting performers (whether Kate Winslet or Samuel Jackson) and never comes out ahead.  It's much the same here...but his natural blankness works better, because we can never quite tell if he's interested in Theron still or just being a tolerant nice-guy.  Reaser shows some nice levels in the fairly thankless role of Wilson's wife, and it reminded me of how truly terrific she was in SWEETLAND.

The film is written by Diablo Cody (JUNO) and directed by the extremely talented Jason Reitman.  The screenplay is witty and less ""cutesy clever"" than JUNO.  Cody is a super sharp observer of mundane details...and Reitman (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, JUNO, UP IN THE AIR) is fantastic at taking dialogue heavy movies and making them pop, move and sizzle.  Cody & Reitman make a great team.  The problem is...YOUNG ADULT is ultimately not an engaging story, and Theron's character is reprehensible in her self-delusion.  At first we laugh at her, then gasp in horror and finally are simply glad to be out of her company.  Everyone has done a really first rate job of bringing the movie to life...but there really is no point to having put in this effort.

Therefore, I say again...you'll enjoy this film as much as you are able to simply enjoy the writing and performances for what they are, and ignore the awful character and story they're all working on so hard.",1324944000,9,3651,4.871961102106969
4678697,4,B005FITIK0,"I grew up in a small town where your fate as a teenager absolutely rests on your social status. Since I had the opportunity to be one of the people who had friends from all across the spectrum of cool to uncool, I had that alienating privilege of feeling as though I never fully belonged to one group. Every year, I got to watch a new batch of the ""supercools"" graduate and go out into a world that was much bigger than their senior-class superlative only to be dashed on the rocks of having to become a normal person. And a lot of them didn't even make it as that.

It is incredible to see a film that portrays that passage of time with such vivid clarity. Haunting scene after haunting scene of a broken person in this situation gives us a realistic portrayal of how someone can so easily avoid reality to live in a dreamworld. You will see someone that you know on the screen when you're watching this film. For some of us, it might be bitterness or anger at a person who embodied what you wanted to be. For others, it will bring sadness because the person in this film is you.

4678698,4,B005FITIK0,"When watching ""Young Adult"", I couldn't help but think of this year's ""Bad Teacher"". The two films have a similar central character: an aging former ""Queen Bee"", still beautiful, but also still stuck in adolescent, immature delusions about how her life should be (as well as a penchant for substance abuse). However, while ""Bad Teacher"" was a low-brow, lightweight comedy, ""Young Adult"" aims much higher, and although it has moments of humor, is a serious and often painful character study.

Mavis left her small town home of Mercury to move to Minneapolis, where she has had a fairly successful career as a writer of young adult fiction. In her personal life, she has become isolated and lonely, filling up her time with excessive drinking and one-night-stands. When she receives an email notice that her former high school sweetheart, Buddy, had recently become a father, she develops a bizarre and unlikely plan to go back to her home town and win him back.

And so it begins. Although affable Buddy is happy to meet Mavis for a friendly drink, he is clearly content with his life as a husband (to a fun and compassionate woman) and new father, and has no romantic interest in Mavis. Clueless, Mavis continues her pursuit of Buddy, believing that the two are meant to be together and that he secretly feels trapped in his small town life. The more Mavis continues her pursuit, the more she humiliates herself, revealing her immaturity and desperation.

While staying in Mercury, Mavis does also make a genuine connection to Matt, a former classmate still physically crippled by a brutal attack in high school. Despite superficial differences the two have a lot in common: they're both stuck, unable to move on from the past, and share a love of excessive drinking. Matt, as disappointed and angry as Mavis, is probably the only person in the film to tell her the truth about herself.

Charlize Theron gives a terrific, nuanced performance, and is willing to explore her character at both as her most humorous and bitchy as well as at her most pathetic and pitiful. And Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswold both create fleshed out human beings out of characters who could have easily been two dimensional. ""Young Adult"" is not always an easy film to watch, but it's definitely a cut above the average Hollywood studio film.",1324857600,13,2321,4.853535353535354
4678699,5,B005FITIK0,"We all know a woman like Mavis Gary. She's the kind of girl who everyone feared in high school, who was always effortlessly beautiful, and yet she had no personality whatsoever. She would do whatever was thought to be ""cool"". Her loved-but-feared status meant that she probably barely registered your existence at all. We assume that this kind of woman goes on to do great things, and becomes an amazing person who would have a whole new generation of people fearing her, but that is not always the case, and that is where we meet Mavis, in ""Young Adult"".

Diablo Cody will forever be known for writing 2007's hip-dialogue laden and instantly memorable ""Juno"", a somewhat controversial teen comedy, which served as a star vehicle for Ellen Page, ensuring that she will play rebellious teenagers well into her thirties. Diablo Cody has reunited with her ""Juno"" director, Jason Reitman, for ""Young Adult"". I would like to mention that aside from auteur moments in Cody's writing, this is nothing at all like ""Juno"", and that's a good thing.

""Young Adult"" is the study of a borderline psychotic personality. It's the story of Mavis Gary, a woman pushing 40, who lives alone, with her obviously neglected Pomeranian, in her disheveled condo in Minneapolis. She is a ghost writer of young adult fiction, which is ironic, considering she hasn't grown up at all since high school. She is not emotionally matured in any way, and thinks that her living in a neighboring city of her suburban hometown means that she has a life. She gets an e-mail from an old high school boyfriend who invites her to a baby-naming ceremony, or something like that. Fully intending to get him back, she blatantly ignores the fact that he is a husband and new father. In her mind, there is something not right in the universe, and she intends to fix it.

We don't really know, as an audience, if we are supposed to feel empathy for Mavis, or if we should just feel pity. At several points in the film, we see Mavis laying face-down on a bed, either in her cold pigsty apartment, or her hotel room, where she appears to be dead. She's never dead, just dead drunk. Her character says to her parents at one point, ""I think I might be an alcoholic"", and the statement is largely ignored. Anyone who says this aloud knows damn well that they are, and the fact that her parents ignored this statement shows you what kind of family this woman came from. Mavis is definitely an alcoholic, seen repeatedly drinking heavily just to make it through the day. She may as well have been drunk in every scene. This is a study of a depressive character, but the thing that bothered me was that her parents ignored this statement, because they would obviously rather pretend that there is no issue. It's upsetting, but like I said, it shows where this woman became this way. That's good writing.

This film works because the lead character is extremely well written and observed, but also because Charlize Theron knocks this one out of the park. First of all, before I get to any other facts about this character, I must say that Theron plays a drunk very well. The last thing I remember seeing her in was her infamous performance as Aileen Wournos in 2003's ""Monster"", and it is going to sound trite, but she's playing a different kind of monster here. She is a woman whose main goal in this film is to break up a marriage. She gave so much of herself to this character, and she may as well be responsible for the film's success. I personally liked Mavis, a character who we're supposed to hate, or feel great pity for, and I give Theron most of the credit for that.

Patton Oswalt, of stand-up comedy fame, plays Mavis's ally in the whole thing, Matt, a guy who graduated with her, who she probably never talked to in high school, yet he is either fascinated by her antics, or just enjoys talking to her, because they become good friends. I know Oswalt from Cody's Showtime series ""United States of Tara"", where he also played the kind of character he plays here: the voice of reason to a borderline sociopath. He is a crucial ingredient to why this film is as good as it is, and had to be mentioned.

With ""Juno"", ""Thank You For Smoking"", and ""Up in the Air"", and now ""Young Adult"", Jason Reitman has a fantastic track record. I have enthusiastically enjoyed each of his films thus far. It's interesting for me to think of this film as a companion piece to 2009's ""Up in the Air"", two films about emotionally stunted individuals. [George] Clooney's character in ""Up in the Air"" didn't want to feel anything, and didn't want to get too close to anyone. The film ends with him not exactly changing, but moving forward in his life, ignoring factors that would have emotionally devastated the average person, and just moving forward. Meanwhile, Mavis is irrevocably stuck in the past. The best time in her life was high school, where she was popular and kind of feared, and now she is just pitied. Yet she is obsessed with making her glory days a reality again.

There is nothing warm, sentimental or happy about the ending of this film, let me just say that right off the top. The film itself is dour, bleak and emotionally brutal. The performances are powerful, and the writing is excellent, yet it doesn't have the warm, happy, everything-is-better-all-of-a-sudden ending that American audiences are used to, and that's a damn good thing. Most character studies about unlikable people typically have the antihero change for the better in the end, in an ending where everything is warm, and everyone is left happy, but Mavis doesn't get off the hook that easily. While the film, in a whole, is quite depressing, its brand of black-as-night comedy is refreshing and welcome. I would call it the meanest Hollywood film this year, and that's a very good thing.

4678702,4,B005FITIK0,"An original movie with a different presentation of the idea of rural v. urban. Heretofore, urban lifestyles have, more often than not, been cool, this movie has a different characterization of urban anonymity.
Sure it was bleak for Mavis, the urban big city girl but it was unusual since it turned the contemporary cultural idea of cool girl, single in the city, on its head in that Mavis from Minny Apples(Minneapolis) was not happy and the simple people who stayed home in their small town to simply live and die were. For the last forty years we have been presented with cosmopolitan urbanity as the ne plus ultra of a life well lived while the stay-at-homes who know each others business are just shucking hicks. The movie was unusual in that it presented the small towners as healthier, happier and less conflicted than the highly experienced, all too urbanly jaded Mavis.
In the end I wondered whether Mavis, who, in the middle of the movie, had commented about 'people who feel nothing' was just on a foray to her roots to find some different material for her writing.",1324512000,,1075,4.723404255319149

The solution? Revisit the wretched home town and snatch her old flame from the jaws of happily married new parent bliss.

Theron's character is an unrepentantly self absorbed, selfish, judgmental, and abrasive. Her saving graces are being pretty and witty (though she has to work at the pretty more than she used to and the witty is increasingly compromised by uncontrolled alcoholism). ""Wise"" is contributed by Patton Oswalt in an equally strong performance which holds the movie together and gives us understanding eyes to see Theron through. The friendship that grows between them give the movie an otherwise lacking heart and is crucial to keeping us involved.

It's really a story about someone failing at pretty much everything and lunging for what she perceives as her one shot at rescuing her life. And completely screwing that up.",1324512000,2,1049,5.128654970760234
4678704,3,B005FITIK0,"Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody team up again after their success with ""Juno"" in 2007.  Here a former beauty queen and most popular girl in high school realizes that her life isn't very fulfilling.  Now closer to 40 than 30, Mavis Gary (an extraordinary Charlize Theron) spends most night pounding down Bourbon shots and finding love in all the wrong places.  Yet, she's beautiful and sophisticated, at least in public.  She wears beautiful clothes and on the outside appears to be very successful.  On the inside, she's mean and unhappy with her life.

Now living in the big city of ""Minnie Apples"" (Minneapolis), she decides to return to her roots in the small town of Mercury in upstate Minnesota.  There she expects to reacquaint herself with her former high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  No matter that Buddy is now happily married and has a new baby.  To Mavis that is just an inconvenience and can be easily overcome.  As a published writer of ""young adult"" novels, Mavis is perceived as the girl who made the big time by the locals.  Mavis runs into another former student in a local bar who had the locker next to hers.  But she doesn't even remember Matt (Patton Oswalt), a bit of a schlub who Mavis never knew existed.  Matt tries to counter balance Mavis's attempt to sabotage Buddy's marriage.  The byplay between them throughout is the best thing in the film.  Both are excellent.

Overall, however the writing is the weak link.  Films like ""Juno"" and Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" are filled with quick, witty dialog.  Here, it is uneven.  Still, Theron's depiction of Mavis is a revelation.  Mavis is not likeable.  She's clearly damaged and alcohol dependent.  At the same time, we tend to root for her to get it together.
