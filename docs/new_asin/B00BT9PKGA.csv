8573569,5,B00BT9PKGA,"This version of ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" is much better than the Disney version in my opinion.
Cause this version is much like the book.
The animaton on the characters are wonderfully created, the character's voices are pefect and the characters from the book are fantastic.
 The animation on Pinocchio is beautiful.
He's just like the Pinocchio in the book  and the voice is cute.
 I WISH they would release this movie on DVD here at the US.
I hope they will someday because this is a classic animated version of ""Pinocchio"".

8573570,5,B00BT9PKGA,I loved this movie as a kid. Saw it again not to long ago and it holds up. Not only the best animated movie about Pinocchio but one of the best animated movies of all time. In the 70's it was one of the few Oasis in the desert of the animated genra. So glad to see it restored and put on DVD officially.,1383350400,2,303,3.75
