The storyline:
Han Seung-wan [Kim Jae Won] is on a flight to Singapore to surprise his girlfriend on her birthday.  Jung Se-jin [Eugene] is on the same flight to say farewell to the man she loved, who died in Singapore. They bump into each other, literally, and accidentally pick up each other's passports.  As a result of the mix-up they meet again to exchange passports and end up spending the rest of the time together looking for his girlfriend, who is two-timing him with Min Do-Hyuk [Lee Ji-Hoon].  The two end up having to share a hotel room, get very drunk and wake up in bed together.

Back in Korea, Se-jin discovers she is pregnant and decides to keep the baby, but she doesn't tell Seung-wan about the pregnancy. After the baby, Shin-Bi [Jung Da-Bin], who is the real star of this drama is born, life gets really interesting for Seung-wan and Se-Jin.  Although Se-Jin has decided to raise Shin-Bi on her own, her sister, Il-Jin, has other plans.  Seung-wan's life is turned upside down, as he is forced to face fatherhood and the anger of his two-timing girlfriend. The two families force the young parents to marry and the story follows the young family's journey, as they learn to take responsibility as loving parents, husband, wife, and grow to love each other, while facing the ultimate test.

You will giggle, laugh, cry, and cheer for them. Your heart will ache and delight at the same time in their failures and triumphs.  Shin-Bi will steal your heart!  :-)",1355184000,,1639,4.659722222222222
