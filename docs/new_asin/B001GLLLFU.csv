3614279,3,B001GLLLFU,"This is a generally good biography of C.S. Lewis, probably the greatest Christian writer and apologist of the 20th century.

The DVD is very well made with excellent cinematography, enlightening interviews with family members and others, good musical scores and excellent narration by Ben Kingsley.

The DVD does a good job of tracing Lewis's life from the childhood loss of his mother and subsequent life in cruel boarding schools, his early academic achievements, his service in WWI, his conversion to Christianity with the assistance of fellow Oxford dons including JRR Tolkein as well as his relationship and marriage to Joy Davidman. The DVD shows Lewis as a brilliant writer and thinker who was always frank and honest about his early atheism, his conversion and subsequent faith in Christ.

Although the DVD is very well made and approaches the life of CS Lewis as a whole in a methodical fashion, I only gave this DVD 3 stars. The video, at one point, makes the spurrious suggestion that Lewis may have had an affair with Mrs. Moore, the mother of a fallen comrade who died in the trenches of WWI. Lewis had made a pact with ""Paddy"" Moore that if one did not survive combat, the other would take care of the family of the one who died. I felt it unseemly to make this suggestion for which there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever.

Although well made, I give it only three stars and would, instead, recommend ""C.S. Lewis: Beyond Narnia"" available here on Amazon in preference. It is a far superior video.",1286496000,43,1515,4.793103448275862
3614280,5,B001GLLLFU,"For those who want to learn more about the man behind the words, this is one of the two best CS Lewis biographical documentaries I've seen, and is the one easier to purchase (the other being the documentary they attached to the Extended Edition of the Disney film version of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe).  It is also the less emotional in approach, which makes it better suited to someone who wants the basic facts about Lewis' life and wants to see a documentary that doesn't take an emotionally loaded approach.  If you already have that documentary, don't hesitate to purchase this one, as it provides a different type of enjoyment.  I feel entirely comfortable watching one after the other.",1259280000,45,702,4.737704918032787
3614281,4,B001GLLLFU,Somewhat disappointed in this DVD of Lewis's life. Never knew that there are no Known images of him on film. Great man and I love all of his books except the sci-fi series.,1256860800,8,172,4.242424242424242

3614298,3,B001GLLLFU,so so tissue of quotes about life of Lewis.  Didn't seem particularly original... although they interview interesting people and it would be of interest to Lewis fans.,1375488000,,167,5.185185185185185
3614299,5,B001GLLLFU,This is nicely done and gives a good summary of CS Lewis personal development.  I liked it  and will re-visit it often.,1373500800,4,119,4.363636363636363
3614300,3,B001GLLLFU,"Interesting, but not exactly the quality of documentary that I would have supposed. All the persons interviewed were not identified nor their relationships to Lewis. I did appreciate the director's explanation of why there is so little visual documentation/photographs of Lewis.",1360540800,,278,5.804878048780488
3614301,5,B001GLLLFU,"This documentary is a good overview of C. S. Lewis's life.  Most of the information is general and can be found in other sources, but there were some new bits.  The look at Lewis's home was very interesting, too.",1357776000,,212,4.410256410256411
8305856,4,B001GLLLFU,"A few years ago, my parents gave me a documentary called The Question of God, in which Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis are compared. This documentary made me want to learn more about C.S. Lewis and how he became the man he was. The documentary The Life of C.S. Lewis: The Magic Never Ends, takes us on a tour through Lewis life and work, and includes interviews with friends of C.S. Lewis as well as theologians, literary scholars, and authors. It is a great, beautiful introduction to C.S. Lewis' life and work, although I think it could have been more in-depth. Also, I thought it was odd that, as with the famous world religion scholar, folklorist, professor, lecturer and author Joseph Campbell (1904-1987), C.S. Lewis, along with many of the people in this documentary, tried to pretend like the term ""myth"" supposedly had positive connotations, when, in fact, the word 'myth' comes from the Greek word 'mythos,' meaning 'falsehood.' Indeed,  While I would recommend this documentary, one thing that irritated me was that, as with the BBC series Religions of the World, only certain interviewees names were shown when they were speaking. It appeared that those who made this documentary assumed that people would already know who certain people were. That was a bit perplexing. Given the fact that this is the second documentary which I have seen in which this is the case, and given the fact that both documentaries in which this has happened were made in the U.K., I have to honestly wonder whether, culturally speaking, producers of documentaries in the U.K. expect viewers to know who a particular interviewee is, irrespective of the extent of a particular viewer's knowledge of a particular subject.  Also, on Amazon, this documentary was advertised on Amazon as being two hours long, and on the back of the documentary, it was described as being an hour and fifteen minutes long; but in reality, it was only fifty minutes long. That was disappointing. I was expecting it to be much more comprehensive. Despite these somewhat minor drawbacks, it is nonetheless a fascinating, beautiful documentary which I would recommend.",1514419200,,2129,4.977528089887641
