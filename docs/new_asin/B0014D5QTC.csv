8255203,2,B0014D5QTC,"The tropical setting is beautiful and Sara Ivanhoe does a nice job leading you through the series of poses, but the title of this workout is not accurate. This is not a ""power yoga"" workout and there is absolutely no sweating. It's more of a series of gentle stretches that feel good, but never work up a sweat and are not very challenging. I was pretty disappointed in this one.",1285286400,,379,4.428571428571429
8255204,3,B0014D5QTC,"This is set in a tropical area with an ocean behind. Sara is alone teaching & no props are used. The dvd comes in 2.0 & 5.1 dolby & has health tips & for washing your mat.
After the 1 min intro, the warm up is simple seated side stretches & twisted sage for 2 min.
For 4 min, you then are kneeling on one leg & straight on the other, more side stretches & side plank (need good arm strength to hold whole body on one hand & sides of feet.)
Next for 3 min is wide legged forward bend, then some simple breathing with arm movements in mountain stance. Then a mountain stance w/arm movements of warrior II.
Next is twisted chair pose, then eagle for 3 min.
Next is downward dog, simple lunge, hamstring stretch, cow stretch which is like Indian style butterfly stretch for 4 min.
Next is dolphin which is like downward dog on your elbows with raising one leg at a time for stretch & strengthening. Last is kinda a cobra & pulling on your feet for stretching your quads for 3 min.
It ends in a seated meditation/mudra with your fingers in a simple pose.

The hardest part for me was the side plank only on my left hand. I didn't sweat at all or barely work except for that. When she did mountain style w/warrior 2 hands, I did regular warrior 2 & seemed to do it more deeply then she showed. I have been doing yoga 1-2x/week for about 5 years & consider myself a beginner/intermediate in terms of strength but even better flexibility.
I had trouble with getting into this dvd because I could tell she seemed distracted & not into the routine & nor is she new with the camera. The whole point of yoga is the flexibility AND being more aware of the moment & your body.

8255205,5,B0014D5QTC,I love this series. This DVD completed it for me. Although I didn't get extremely sweaty I could really feel it the next day.,1245283200,,125,4.25
8255206,2,B0014D5QTC,This video does not make you sweat at all.  It is for beginners.  I was looking for a yoga video with more movement so I would sweat and I found this to be very simple.  I was disappointed the words Power and Sweat were in the title and feel it is a misrepresentation of what the video is.  This is more something I may do before bed.,1222992000,2,334,3.9402985074626864
