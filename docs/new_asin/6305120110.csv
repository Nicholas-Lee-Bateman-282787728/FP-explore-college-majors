7883500,5,6305120110,"As a vintage romanic comedy film freak I enjoyed this film alot.  I was already a fan of Yolande Donlan, who starred in ""Penny Princess"" with Dirk Bogarde in 1952.  Love that film!  This one was made in 1951 and it's unique and full of the old English countryside and characters.  Mr. Drake (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) and his new wife (Yolande Donlan) are enjoying their Sussex farm until one of their accidentally acquired ducks lays a radioactive uranium egg!  (only in the fifties!) The antics have begun and all of the armed forces come swarming in keeping Mr. Drake and several characters on hold at the country estate.  It's not a classic like ""The Sound of Music"" but it's fun and a great comedic period piece.",1495152000,,714,4.626984126984127
