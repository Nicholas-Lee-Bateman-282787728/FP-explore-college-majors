8244313,5,B00126ZR7W,A heartwarming film. One of the best I've seen recently. Watch the trailer if you can find one. An amazing story.,1485388800,,113,4.428571428571429
8244314,5,B00126ZR7W,"""Simple"" story, but profound message. An elderly woman visits her grandson soldier in a military camp in Chechnya for a few days. There are two ""currents"" in this movie by the great Sokurov, one in the camp itself and another of her unauthorized visit to a nearby Chechen town's market. Life in the camp is routine, but her visit into town is remarkable by her spontaneous and natural connection with an elderly woman. Here is evidence of the profound importance for 2 sides in a war to connect as human beings. Consequently this is a deep anti war movie. The screenplay is strong, the acting, especially by Galina Vishnevskaya (widow of cellist Rostropovich and herself a top opera singer)  impressive.
In an interview the soft spoken Sokurov expresses regret that he was passive during the Hungarian revolt, but now determined to make his voice, an anti war expression, known.",1432252800,2,878,4.89261744966443
8244315,5,B00126ZR7W,"What is the purpose of a film? Some are set to entertain, others to make us question life's core values, and there are those to stir our souls. The film Alexandra examines the choices we make (and are forced upon us) and how we cope with them. The elderly woman sets out to visit her grandson who is stationed at a military outpost, in a remote part of Russia. Alexandra goes there with a purpose, yet we do not know what it is until she confides in her grandson that she fears for him, that she is lonely and that her body is giving out (whereas her soul is ready for another lifetime). The two of them share a unique relationship, one of warmth and a mutual understanding of loneliness and the hardships of life.

The film examines life in a subtle way. There is no melodrama or sentimentality. Alexandra, the character, is a strong woman who is neither sweet or harsh. Her character is shown through her small, yet very significant, acts of kindness. She encounters many people, and through small gestures and very few words, she becomes a friend to each person she meets, even though their physical encounter may last only a few minutes or hours. Two of the most poignant exchanges are between her and an elderly woman who invites Alexandra for tea, and a young man who asks Alexandra ""to give us our freedom back"".

It's a beautiful film that is poetic and dream like. It's a meditative look on life that you'll be absorbed in before you know it. After I finished watching it, and still now, a day later, I can't stop thinking about it. This is a unique film that provokes one to think and to feel.",1375488000,,1603,4.430508474576271
8244316,4,B00126ZR7W,"Alexandra is about a grandmother visiting her grandson on base while in the middle of the Chechen occupation. The movie is pretty slow as there's absolutely no action in it, but I think that's the point. This movie to me is more about the emotional. The relationships between the soldiers and how they react to having a ""motherly figure"" around. The relationship between Alexandra and her grandson and even a little insight into her relationship with her late husband. Most especially I found the nature of the relationship between the Chechens and Alexandra to be the most potent. This movie perfectly shows the uneasiness of relations involving the younger generation versus the older people who lived during soviet times and simply think of each other as ""comrades"". This film may be slow but it's well worth the time spent watching it especially if you're interested in the Russian-Chechen conflict.",1310342400,,903,5.067114093959732
8244317,5,B00126ZR7W,"What an absolutely magnificent, overwhelming and ultimately satisfying film this is.

Sokurov stated he had never written his own screenplay before, but felt it his duty to write a film for Vishnevskaya, partly to honor her as a great actress, but also to hopefully expiate his sins as a young man who said nothing, did nothing while people like Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich openly decried the soviet regime and their belief in democracy and human freedom generally.

Few people make more beautiful looking films than Sokurov, and ""Alexandra"" is no exception, despite its location and subject matter.  Shot in the barren wastelands of war ravaged Chechnyan border, Sokurov's ever changing palette moves from brilliantly captured colors (a tree's leaves rustling in the breeze against a dusty background) to dreamlike darkness, black and white and sepia tone - the visual equivalent of a symphony or sonata.  I always forget how frustrated I become at the beginning of one of his films because his soundscapes always begin almost inaudibly, the ear straining to catch bits of dialogue that seem almost not there.  It's an effect which ultimately works drawing the viewer into the world he's creating, not unlike one's initial inability to figure out what's going on when entering a party or event.

There is not much to the story:  an old woman, going to visit her long absent grandson, Denis, an army captain, at his base camp on the Chechnyan border.  After an arduous journey she arrives to the camp, a makeshift military tent village and settles in as images of her journey pass through her mind (this happens frequently throughout). She awakens to find Denis asleep and a truly touching reunion ensues, as he parades her through the camp watching the soldiers going about their mundane duties.  Denis is often gone, but the base soldiers stare at and interact with this independent, fiesty, rule-breaking old lady and we sense the soldiers' longing for home and love.  A day long journey to a Chechen village to buy cigarettes and cookies for the soldiers, finds her in a pitiful marketplace and at the point of exhaustion, where she is befriended by another old woman, the rest of the villagers fascinated by this ""foreigner.""

Vishnevskaya's performance is nothing short of astonishing as is her physical appearance:  stripped of elegant costumes, hair color, and make up, her crusty, tired old Russian grandmother still radiates an undeniable beauty, and Sokurov's camera frequently lingers on it.  That face, at once world weary, angry, frightened somehow almost always registers a kind of hope that infuses the entire film.  Alexandra mumbles - constantly, even when no one's around, or her grandson has left their quarters, an almost endless monologue.  Scenes of her wandering the camp, the roads, shuffling along in her old lady shoes, complaining of her bad legs is precisely the type of thing that would bore one to tears in most films, but here, oh there is something underneath all of that.

Sokurov's uses his usual casting tricks and lights his actors with a radiance that everyone - even angry young men - look beatific, with a belief that everyone really IS beautiful.  There is a bit of naivete in such thinking and that (for me) is what makes all of the films I've seen of his, seem ""more than a movie,"" but never preachy.  The actor portraying Denis really could be Alexandra's grandson as when they sit together on his cot, their faces are so similar it's uncanny.

""Alexandra"" is a war movie that never shows a single fight scene but rather the ""real"" price of war and in so doing, is a powerful, sometimes heartbreaking statement.

The movie is almost overloaded with moments of extreme tenderness and poignancy - which against the ravaged, brutal and stark background, makes them all the more moving.  Alexandra's new Chechen friend asks a teenage neighbor boy to accompany her on the walk back to the base and their brief conversation is one of the film's most powerful moments, when he asks ""why won't you let us be free?""  ""If only it were that simple, my boy,"" telling him the first thing we should ask God for is intelligence . . . strength does not lie in weapons or in our hands.""  The movie is filled with these little pearls that could almost be cliche, but not when uttered by this remarkable old woman.

The scene of her last night with Denis almost undid me completely . . . never mind ""almost"" it did just that.  Only 90 minutes, the movie felt even shorter and I can't recall a recent film that had me smiling and near tears so many times with so seemingly ""little"" to it.  A truly remarkable achievement by a wonderful filmmaker and an 83 year old actress in her first non-singing film.  I hope others will take the time to see this.",1276560000,10,4776,4.821078431372549
8244318,5,B00126ZR7W,"Sokurov's work is always worth watching (Elegy of the Land, Russian Ark, and Spiritual Voices spring joyfully to mind), but of them all surely Alexandra stands a perfect work of collaborative genius. The great attraction for me was getting the gifts of Galina Vishnevskaya in the role of a lifetime. Her own life has been profounder than an opera role; &she's an actor of pungent means by an instinctive, interior passion rarely enough found. Her acuteness makes the camera itself but a vessel in the end. Her performance reveals a character by a kind of ecstatic stasis, detailed with subtleties impossible to catalog, and likely unforgettable. She creates with myriad near-psychic details, gestures, glances, aided by a consummately naked script, &the culminating effect lodges in mind and heart with real anguish. There's little to add to Ted Byrd's review; comments richly insightful. This is filmmaking we don't get from Hollywood; art made from suffering is the difference that defines. A brilliant anti-war film, yes, and more - in work this truthful and beautiful, the war policies of American profiteers find a perfect antidote. It's a film experience to cherish, recommended with urgency.",1261785600,12,1198,5.244791666666667
8244319,4,B00126ZR7W,"There is a plodding self-absorption to Sokurov's films that can make them impenetrable or, at times, maddening. That said, there are surely many fans of his art - he counts 17 films and twice as many documentaries.

The story line for Alexandra is simple: Alexandra Nikolayevna (Galina Vishnevskaya) goes to visit her grandson, a captain serving in Chechnya. She stays in the military compound, roams the tents, observes life among the troops, wanders to the market, befriends a Chechen woman, and in general witnesses the alien, emotionless life of the Russian military. Exhausted and demoralized, she departs for home as her son heads off on another mop-up operation.

Sokurov's laconic, realist style is well-suited to this tale, where everything seems to be brown or dusty green, where nothing much happens, though we sense that somewhere near, just beyond the range of the camera, something soon will. Alexandra wants something better, wants to live near her son, to be at peace. She will attain none of this, but she will have a brief time of tenderness with her grandson.

Filmed inside Chechnya under siege-like conditions, Alexandra is a striking film. Though the overt, spoken anti-war statements come across as trite and forced, this is overshadowed by powerful visuals. And Vishnevskaya (widow of Mstislav Rostropovich) is superb as the tired Alexandra, endearing with her ceaseless mumblings, forgetfulness and deeply feeling heart. (As reviewed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-Life/dp/B00008CQIB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian Life</a>)",1244764800,4,1608,5.805084745762712
8244320,5,B00126ZR7W,"Alexander Sokurov has demonstrated to have inherited the priceless coronet among the most genuine distinctive and fervent spiritual followers of Andrei Tarkovsky.

This sharp, reflexive and inventive metaphor deals with the visit that Aleksandra Nikolaevna makes to her grandson, one of the best officers of his unity. She travels there to live together with that masculine universe, in which there are no women, no comfort, no tenderness. The life is meaningless and everyone jealously hides it from the others. There is military proud, desire to be recognized in that well apart place, where neither of the members of that little village appreciate them. Maybe there's no energy or even time for the feelings, being the authority, discipline and obedience are only the elements which formally has to be kept in mind for the rest of the trop.  Everyday, every hour, everything debates between life and death. However, she sparks a light of hope, humanity and transcendental signification for the human being, because before nothing it` s a community where there are persons.

A poignant film that care and beautifully undertakes its warmth poetry before our eyes from start to finish.

Don't miss this brilliant jewel of the cinema.",1217635200,12,1233,5.212121212121212
