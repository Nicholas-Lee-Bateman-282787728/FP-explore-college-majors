It also offers the views of Mexican scholars and goes into the idea of Manifest Destiny and Polk's policies.  More information on the anti-war protesters such as Henry David Thoreau would be desirable, but all in all a good product for history lovers.",1261958400,5,349,5.0

3649581,4,B001IQDARK,"I am surprised no one has yet written a review of this DVD.  Issues with Mexicans are important today as they were in 1846.

A war that started over the perceived border between Texas and Mexico turned into a long and drawn-out war that at the time cost more American lives that all its previous wars to date.  The historians interviewed for this documentary were unbiased; we learn about both sides and see history from both points of view.

""President Polk lied!"" said one Mexican historian.

What started as a border dispute turned into an invasion of Mexico.  Internal fighting in Mexico City caused the Mexican government to withdraw its troops along its northern frontier to fight the growing civil war in  the capital.  This was the turning point in this war; not even the Mexicans were in accord of how to fight this war against the US.

Although some of the reenactments were cheesy (there were few photographs taken of this war to be used as visuals) maps, quotes from diaries and documents were used to explain this war that took away half of Mexico's landmass and fulfilled the American dream of Manifest Destiny.

For someone who has only picked up American history within the last two years, this documentary opened up many eyes for me.  I learn about Los Patricios, Irish-American deserters from the US Army who fought for the Mexican side because the Mexicans were, like the Irish, Catholic and there was much discrimination against the Irish in the 18th through 20th centuries.  This is real history, both brutal and unjust but unscripted.

Oscar de la Hoya narrated parts of this documentary.  ""When I won that Olympic medal I won it for both countries"" perhaps explains the importance of US-Mexican relations even for today.

In 1846 President Polk had offered Mexico $30 million for the land that is now our Southwest and West. Mexico refused.  Two years later Mexico relented and surrendered that same landmass for a mere $15 million.",1254009600,40,1955,4.8258258258258255

3649583,1,B001IQDARK,"This documentary of the Mexican-American War is a vastly one-sided presentation that is far inferior to the PBS one that was made some years earlier, beacuse even though it features some of the same talking heads, here they are less restrained and more biased.  What I find offensive is how this presentation is so determined to present us with a shallow sophomoric view of evil America bullying innocent Mexico that it willfully distorts the historical record to do so.  And what I find really funny is how Americans are expected to prostrate themselves in a sea of self-flaellation for what they did wrong yet NOT ONCE are Mexicans expected to account for their own actions.  They are always allowed to defend stubbornly everything they did and that means whitewashing their own conduct to push this shallow black-white narrative.

Let's start with one talking head who says James K. Polk lied when he presented his declaration of war to Congress over how the Mexicans fired first on American soil.  The lie is the one that comes from the talking head's mouth.  The case for the American/Texan claim of the Rio Grande border was much stronger than the Mexican claim, and the reason for this is not mentioned once in the film.  THE TEXAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE!  Do you ever hear about the critical background of why Texas broke from Mexico?  No.  Do you ever hear about the butchery and brutality of General Santa Anna?  No.  Do you ever hear how the Mexicans bullied their President into resigning as a traitor after he warned his countrymen on the foolishness of going to war with the United States?  No.  Do you ever hear about the Mexican mismanagement of their economy under a string of failed governments that left them in debt to the United States, and which they had a chance to get out from under if they had merely accepted the John Slidell offer prior to the war (which turned out to be roughly the SAME offer they took in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  Just think of how many lives would have been saved if they'd simply put their foolish pride aside.  And if you think that's asking too much, I would point out that pride is what got America involved with ITS war with Britain in 1812 and that war would have been a disaster but for the lucky end with the Battle of New Orleans).

Yes, Abraham Lincoln attacked Polk for unconstitutionally exceeding his authority, but Lincoln of course would exceed Polk's use of Presidential power (rightly) as President, and that context is missing.  The opposition to war with Mexico largely came from northern politicians who were (justly) concerned about the impact of such a war on the expansion of slave territory but the vote, let us remember was near unanimous at the time beacuse there could be no disputing the fact that MEXICO FIRED FIRST!  And there were many European observers who thought Mexico would win because they had a bigger army whereas America had very few numbers of Federal troops overall so the idea that America was a military monolith bullying innocent Mexico with its might is a laughable premise.  The simple fact is that Mexico had made its hold on the territories they lost vulnerable beacuse of their own mismanagement which when butting heads against Manifest Destiny was a lethal combination.

The real danger of a film like this is how it presents a distorted view of history not just to Americans but to Mexicans as well by encouraging an overly romanticized rose-colored ""we did nothing wrong"" view of their conduct that is as false as the idea that America was noble and pure and in the right.  I regret that I had to use it once in my history class and I intend to rectify that with the PBS one next time which was much more fair-minded and acknowledged some of the Mexican faults that took place.",1364428800,19,3786,4.687311178247734

3649586,5,B001IQDARK,"I liked this video because, I thought, it completed the information I've learned in the other PBS documentary
called ""The U.S.- Mexican War"" which, by the way, was longer and had a bit more information than this one. They
also consulted renowned professors and researchers in the subject and elaborated more on certain subjects that
the other PBS documentary just skimmed on.

I recommend watching this video because it is very informative, specially if you are interested in finding out about
this conflict or just to know more about the history of these two neighboring nations.",1348185600,8,580,5.041666666666667

3649588,5,B001IQDARK,"""America's War of Conquest"" is not a phrase that rolls easily off the tongue, the pen, or the keyboard. But that's exactly what this war was all about.  That may explain why the Mexican-American War is, arguably, the nation's most neglected conflict.

The concept of the U.S.'s Manifest Destiny--that it was the nation's God-endorsed role to overspread the American continent from ""sea to shining sea"" had well taken root in the national consciousness by the mid-1840s; President James Knox Polk was an adherent.  Campaigning for the Presidency in 1844, Polk not only advocated the annexation of the Republic of Texas (which actually occurred in the waning days of the Tyler Administration, after the election) and the purchase of California and other northern Mexican territory, Polk also talked belligerently of taking ""all"" of the disputed Oregon Country. ""Fifty-four forty or fight"" was one of the pro-Polk campaign slogans, a reference to the disputed area's northern latitude demarcation.  Cooler heads prevailed, and the United States did not pick a war with a stronger opponent, Britain.  Instead, after a relatively arrogantly-expressed offer to buy the northern Mexican Territory for $30 million was rejected, the U.S. picked a war with a weaker opponent, Mexico.

That was the backdrop for the ""border dispute"" (was the Texas/Mexico border the Rio Grande River?; or was it the Nueces River?)that triggered the outbreak of war between Mexico and the United States.  The video makes clear--with brief but effective interpretive sound bites by both Mexican and U.S. historians--that Polk manipulated information from far-off Texas to obtain a declaration of war from the U.S. Congress: ""American blood was shed on American soil.""  Shades of LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

That the war was one of American conquest is made abundantly clear by the fighting.  General Zachary Taylor was initially surprised and Polk infuriated by the Mexicans' refusal to give up half their territory even after a few bloody battles.  Meanwhile, General Stephen Kearny was dispatched to take and occupy California by way of Sante Fe, New Mexico--a heads-up, if one is needed, that this was no limited conflict merely to secure the Texas border.

The war slogged on. Kearny met greater-than-anticipated resistance in Southern California.  Tayler was relieved of overall command by a politically jealous Polk.  General Winfield Scott (his ""Old Fuss and Feathers"" was a polar opposite of Taylor's ""Old Rough and Ready"") took the lion's share of Taylor's troops to mount the then-largest amphibious attack in the history of warfare at Vera Cruz.  Polk sent Nicholas Trist to negotiate a peace and continue to push for the purchase of the northern territories.  Something like a war-protest movement began to develop back in the States.

Mexico recalled ousted President Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna from exile to take command of the nation's defense. Under Santa Anna, the Mexican army fought bravely, gallantly and well--but ultimately was pushed back. The bravery of the individual Mexican soldier accounted for the very great difficulty the U.S. had in disparching an on-paper weaker foe more quickly--and more in keeping with Polk's impatient timetable. In the midst of the war political controversy amounting to virtual civil war forced Santa Anna and many of his troops back to Mexico City to restore order.

In the end, Scott's army invested Mexico City fter a spirited defense and in the end, the U.S. acquired the territory it had wanted all along--for $15 million instead of $30 million, but at the additional price of 13,780 American lives and an estimated 25,000-plus Mexican lives.

The video alternates beteen re-enactment scenes--(which are never terribly satisfying in lieu of Mathew Brady's glass-plate still photography or twentieth century motion-picture footage, both of which were of course unavailable for this conflict)--and on-location views--(the juxtaposition of shots of modern-day Mexico City and the Mexico City of Santa Anna and Scott are especially effective)--with the historians' talking heads make for a relatively lively 100 minute summary of this conflict. Very good use is also made of contemporaneous battle-scene paintings as well. The historians are, remarkably, not dry-as-dust at all. One Mexican historian calls Polk a liar and Santa Anna vain; an American historian calls Polk mean-spirited.  The Mexican historians decry the vacuum of leadership at the top in their nation at the time. Punches really are not pulled at all in the commentary.  The overall host/narrator is boxer Oscar de la Hoya, a man of dual citizenship who can, maybe more than most, appreciate the conflict from both sides.

I rated the dvd at 5 stars, higher than most of the others who have reviewed it, because I think it is extremely effective in the classroom--I used individual dvd chapters in an American Wars class to good effect.  (I agree showing any 100-minute video--or half that long for that matter--""reel-to-reel"" as it were--is an invitation to student slumber.)  But this presentation's balanced approach in which the strengths--and warts--of both sides are clearly illustrated is both educational and entertaining.  And for the adult general American history buff who may have missed the clear importance of the Mexican-American War in high school, this dvd is well worth an hour and a half in front of the TV.",1297555200,5,5434,5.276102088167053
3649589,2,B001IQDARK,"The Mexican War tends to be a neglected episode in American history which is arguably strange since it so dramatically increased the size of the nation. Unfortunately, I felt that this treatment portrays the conflict simply as a naked land grab on the part of President James Polk. In fact, both sides were looking for a fight and both sides sent troops into disputed territory and the Mexicans fired first. Which certainly delighted Polk. The fact that in 1846 Mexico had the larger army and a strong desire to recapture it's lost Texas province seems to be overlooked. This was not a super power fighting a Third World nation in 1846. Many European military experts expected Mexico to win. Even a war criminal like Santa Anna gets something of a free pass and his crimes at the Alamo and Goliad ten years earlier are not even mentioned. I don't mean to minimize the expansionist thrust of the Polk Administration, but the war was considerably more complicated politically and morally than this documentary would have you believe.",1294012800,36,1031,4.863636363636363
