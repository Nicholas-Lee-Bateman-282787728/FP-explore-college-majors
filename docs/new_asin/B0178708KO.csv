8738289,3,B0178708KO,"I received my Hemodynamic Monitoring and 12 Lead EKG Interpretation DVD and Critical Care Examination Review book purchased on Amazon (purchased separately). There is not a lot of reviews regarding this DVD; trust me I searched and searched to find one before purchasing and it was scarce. The DVD is pricey so I spent a lot of time researching and I had it on my wish list for a while before deciding to get it.

I became familiar / aware of Laura Gasparis in my quest to take the CCRN exam this year. I also have a goal of wanting to get better at my job and at a higher level.

What I received with the DVD set: 3 DVDs, a hemodynamic monitoring booklet in black and white, and some advertisement brochures.

I don't know what to really say about it. The information is great but the quality of the video is not great.  One of the things I was trying to find prior to purchasing was the year this was made. The DVDs says 2003, which as a newer nurse, I am thinking to my self, is this still appropriate for 2018 and will I know the difference.  I do think the fundamental teaching is still relevant especially with the EKG information.  The videos were obviously made during one of Lauras tours and the light was off and it was dark; therefore, the video is dark. Whoever is taping it is constantly moving the darn thing from left to right and thats because she is in between two large screens and she is moving from left to right and one moment she is pointing to the left screen and the other moment the right screen. Additionally, the screens of the PowerPoint at times are difficult to see.

The DVD was not cheap and I feel like this should have been half of what I paid for it. I would have rather paid more money for a video that is a better quality and up to the times as far as quality and information, than pay for this one.

I chose the DVD option because it allows me to see and hear the information, which helps me learn. The fact that it is so dark and difficult for me to see is really annoying. I just received it, so I don't know if I want to keep it or not yet.

The brochures and advertisement that I received clearly shows that she is currently teaching this material in 2018 and Im sure every year since. I don't understand why they have not made a video this is of higher quality considering all the technology today and because she is still actively teaching the material.  Of course, now I am debating on paying for the CCRN DVDs. One of my friends just purchased it so Im going to wait it out and see what she gets.

Obviously, she is a brilliant nurse and knows her stuff; I just really wish the DVDs were better made.

I will try to put some pictures up so you can see and be able to make a more informed decision.",1522972800,,2743,4.203809523809523
