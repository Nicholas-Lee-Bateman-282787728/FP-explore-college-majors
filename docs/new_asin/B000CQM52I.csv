There are eleven chapters and each has a different workout. Each workout uses the same actor in the same setup, a young woman in a gym. The young woman does the  routine as the voice over explains. The music is calming and the voice over has a nice calming voice. I still gave this dvd high review because it is a great workout you can work up a sweat. Now for the negative points of the video. This dvd was too fast for me and I'm not as flexible as the actor. I think the dvd is older than 2001 as printed on the case, I think it may have been revised in 2001.
