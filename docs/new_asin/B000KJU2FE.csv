8157504,5,B000KJU2FE,This is the most truly helpful real deal handgun disarming self-defense DVD that I come to know. This should be the #1 DVD you should buy first to get the basics and know what to truly do in case you have to disarm your attacker.,1353024000,,229,4.111111111111111
8157505,5,B000KJU2FE,"Very informative dvd... useful info for l.e.o.'s and even ordinary citizens. The man on the dvd essentially goes over one basic technique that is't really complex, so I would think it would be fairly easy to remember if one was in a situation where one would need to use this information. Very informative, I only watched it once probably almost a month ago and can still remember the technique he taught, however I have not had a chance to practice it with an actual partner, which I believe would be beneficial to one learning this technique.",1337385600,,544,4.677083333333333
8157506,5,B000KJU2FE,"Doug Young is an Excellent teacher for a realistic situation and this video can save your life. Instructor Doug Young shows the viewer a plethora of situations involving hand guns being used against another human being. Incorporating hard (strikes) and soft style martial arts (defensive techniques countering an attacker) Doug Young carefully shows how to disarm the attacker while following through with elbow strikes, low kicks and economic movements which all lead to gaining control of the assailants gun. He stresses that disarming an attacker with a hand gun is a last case scenario and that one should use these teachings only if you believe that you are about to die. A victims possession can be replaced but one's family can not be replaced which means giving up your car keys and money but not your wife and kids. I suggest picking up this video and practicing the many techniques using fake guns as is stated in the disclaimer. Even if you do not have a partner, this video demonstrates an array of movements in the one hour lesson. It beats sitting home and eating Twinkies.",1330732800,,1087,4.849462365591398
8157507,5,B000KJU2FE,"It's quite good, the information obtained is accurate and current. I recommend it to all those interested in the field of protection and the general public,",1264896000,,156,5.038461538461538
8157508,5,B000KJU2FE,"I took a very critical eye into this DVD. I have over 10 years of martial arts background, including 2 years of krav maga, including close quarters gun disarm tactics. I found this DVD superior for the following reasons: the techniques I think work. Plain and simple. The instructor clearly understands all the complexities of gun disarms. He has no ""easy answers"", but he offers techniques that work. He uses a ""get inside the circle"" concept which to me makes a lot of sense, and which to me mirrors what the Israelis learn in krav maga (Israeli military martial arts). The instructor in this DVD clearly understands all the complexities, and still offers concepts and techniques that will work. He understands how gun attacks work in the USA: the attacker demands your money, you give it to him, and he still wants to shoot you (this happens all the time in the US). I highly recommend this DVD.",1183766400,4,898,4.689873417721519
