4934844,4,B00634ML5E,"For the price this is a terrific set of three thrillers now the quality of the enclosed thrillers vary a bit but all three have their moments.

""Se7vn"" included here is the special edition of the movie. David Fincher's thriller holds up remarkably well 17 years on with strong performances all around (although I felt Brad Pitt's performance was a bit too mannered for my tastes at the time and even now).

For those that don't know ""Se7vn"" follows two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt)trying to catch a serial killer taking victims lives based on their violation of the seven deadly sins. ""Se7vn"" remains an influential thriller that impacted an entire decade of thrillers altering the look and feel of many of them. That doesn't diminish the power of the original though.

""Copycat"" came out four years after ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and while a more it's certainly a bit more traditional in terms of casting compared to that film (featuring stars that were fairly big at the time), ""Copycat"" got lost in the wake of the more daring ""Se7vn"" but as a thriller it's still a strong film.

Signorney Weaver plays Helen Hudson a agoraphobic psychologist and profiler who ends up working with detective M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) in trying to capture a serial killer who copies OTHER serial killers. Both Hunter and Weaver give terrific performances in the film.

""Taking Lives"" features Angelina Jolie as Illeana a FBI profiler brought in to catch a serial killer who assumes other people's lives (hence the punning title). When the mother (Gena Rowlands) of the killer recognizes him after he supposedly died twenty years before, the Quebec police bring her in to help them catch the killer when one of his victims is accidently uncovered. An art dealer named Costa(Ethan Hawke) who may have seen the killer agrees to help the police and act as bait to lure the killer out into the open.

Be aware there is a somewhat explicit sex scene in the film. Although a bit predictable ""Taking Lives"" is still entertaining and the fact that the story takes place somewhere OTHER than the United States adds to that allure. The opening set up is quite impressive and while the movie does have a lot going for it, most viewers as mentioned will figure the twist out well before the mid point of the film.

All three movies as mentioned are on individual discs with the special features for each of the individual releases included (for example the extensive special features from the ""Se7vn"" release are, as far as I can tell, the same including the multiple commentary tracks and the material ported over from the 2000 Director's Series release on DVD).

""Copycat"" has all the commentary track by director Jon Amiel as well as the theatrical trailer for the movie.

""Taking Lives"" as the documentary on the making of the film, the gag reel as well as the theatrical trailers.

For the price this is a extremely good set with films that range from five stars to three and since the transfer are all excellent looking and include the special features from the individual releases, I'd recommend this set.",1330041600,16,3101,4.790262172284645

4934853,4,B00634ML5E,"From Warner Bros. we get a collection of serial killer movies, two from the '90's and one from '04, thankfully two of this films are great cause one is just dreadful.

Se7en: Director David Fincher (""Fight Club"") gives us a story about a killer whose targeting people that he feels are committing one of the seven deadly sins. Two detectives played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman try to piece together the bits of evidence and inch ever closer to finding out who the killer really is. From the opening frame to the very end this is one magical and great thriller, Freeman really shines here, Kevin Spacey (""The Usual Suspects"") plays a great role, Pitt also does well though he would go on to do better roles than this. It's very visual, visceral and fairly unrelenting in how it presents the horror the killer inflicts upon his victims. This is again just magic throughout the whole presentation. **** out of 4 stars.

Copycat: After almost being killed by a killer named Daryll (Harry Connick Jr. ""Hope Floats""), a profiler named Helen (Sigourney Weaver, ""Alien"") is now an agoraphobic, meaning she's confined to the living space of her apartment. She still does her work, helping detectives figure out who and how to capture criminals, but her skills are being put to the test as a copycat killer named Peter (William McNamara) is killing people in the same way Daryll did earlier. Holly Hunter plays a detective who desperately needs Helen's skills to capture Peter before he kills again. Director Jon Amiel (""Entrapment"") does a good job with the material provided, it's definitely below ""Se7en"" in terms of quality, but ""Copycat"" is a pretty good flick in it's own right and the performances are good for the most part. **1/2 out of 4 stars.

Taking Lives: Here we have a killer who takes on the identity of each of his victims, a profiler named Illeana (Angelina Jolie) is brought by the French Canadian police to assist them in identifying and capturing this killer before he can assume another identity and possibly evade police for good. The whole idea isn't the problem, to me it's the execution and the simple fact it is painfully and I mean painfully obvious who the killer is early on. Unfortunately most of the characters in this flick are just too plain dumb to figure out this obvious fact, though the cast is actually fairly impressive Ethan Hawke (""Training Day""), Kiefer Sutherland (TV's ""24""), Oliver Martinez (""Unfaithful""), Gena Rowlands (""The Skeleton Key"") and Tcheky Karyo (""Kiss of The Dragon"").

How these actors thought this was a good project to be in just eludes me and it stuns me how bad this is with all whose involved. The final sequence is really the icing on the cake as those left alive realize what's happening and who the killer is, it's all just laughable. This is the one lone bad flick in this 3 pack, worth watching to make fun of it. * out of 4 stars.

It's a worthy collection to get especially for ""Se7en"" and 3 movies for a low price is never a bad thing, especially on blu-ray.",1367107200,,3027,4.682330827067669
4934854,5,B00634ML5E,"Love these movies. Great bundle. Seven and Copycat are my favorite out of the 3. I did like them all so 5 solid stars.
Perfect addition to my collection. You get 3 blue-ray disks here. No cramming movies onto one as you see sometimes with other sets or triple features.
Totally worth the money.
Mine came in with slight damage to the plastic case but it was very minor so I decided to keep it since movies or disks were fine.
It was new as described.
Very happy overall and highly recommend this triple feature!",1364169600,,511,4.389473684210526
