1008661,3,6305305765,"Anyone who likes Wilkie Collins (author of ""The Moonstone"" and ""The Woman in White"" and a friend to Dickens) knows that he is in store for a Victorian melodrama mystery with all the trimmings.  This film definitely had the trimmings -- lush sets and gorgeous scenery, plus two notable acting performances from Christian Slater and Derek Jacobi.  However, the writer-director falls down in several areas.  First of all the script has a number of 20th Century anachronisms/cliches, i.e., ""It makes me feel cheap.""  The leading man, Jared Leto, is attractive but emotionally lackluster, almost in a trancelike state -- a real problem since he appears in most scenes.  Nor is there much chemistry between him and anyone else.  Claire Forlani as his love interest is pretty emotionally dead herself, and I strongly suspect the fault is not altogether hers, but the writer-director's.  The editing could be sharper, the pacing tighter -- in short, with a few cast changes, a different director, and a few rewrites, this movie might have delivered more of its many promises.",974505600,19,1067,5.062857142857143
1008662,2,6305305765,"Basil has all the makings of a good movie... Sumptuous sets and scenery, period-piece romance and intrigue, attractive cast.
But... nothing. Falls flat. NO chemistry between any of the three protagonists. No real  cameraderie between Basil and John. NOTHING between John and Julia and  (deadly problem) ZERO between Basil and Julia. It is difficult to feel for  any of them at all. I cannot say what was missing here... maybe a tragic  flaw or two to identify with...
I love costume dramas and this one was  just not up to snuff (like Dangerous Beauty). The film is a lot like Jared  Leto... very beautiful but lacking any sort of magnetism.",951177600,6,641,4.781818181818182
1008742,1,6305305765,"Really bad acting by Leto. Mediocre acting by Slater. Decent acting by the other two characters. Contrived dialogue with laughable delivery. Literally, laugh-out-loud bad. Just no.",1503360000,,180,5.961538461538462
1008743,2,6305305765,"As usual with the book to film adaptation, this is missing quite a few components. In fact, this film sort of makes a jumbled mess of the Wilkie Collins novel.

While certain liberties happen with film adaptations, as a stand alone this is just not a good film at all. The characters, plots, motives are quite weak and silly. While there is still some definite beautiful shots of the scenery and setting, and moments of solid character interaction, in the end, this is just a weak adaptation of the book.",1502236800,,504,4.6

1008888,3,6305305765,"I may be one of the few who actually enjoyed the film.  Leto's character was gullible, unemotional, and bland, but that is easily explained by his lack of love growing up, lack of friends, and lack of experience in life. Slater's character is a typical Slater character, where you think there is something behind the curtain that we aren't shown on film. I had not read the novel, so though I knew there was something of a twist to be expected, I wasn't quite sure from which side the twist would come.
True, this is not best movie I've seen lately, but I did enjoy it.  The lush scenery, the quietly understated acting by the main actors (I assume to symbolize a lack of truth, sincerity, and actual, true love in the characters), and the plot twist all combined to form a film that made me think about it after watching.  Will I watch again? Probably not.  And I watched the film at 2am, so I was tired, but I think I would've enjoyed it anyway.",1483833600,7,947,4.363636363636363

The father is very strict and shows very little affection for Basil and his older brother.  The older brother is thrown out of the house when he marries a local girl instead of a woman of higher standing.  Basil's mother and he are very close but she dies when he is still quite young.  Basil is sent to school at Oxford when he is 18.  He is a good student but has very few friends.  At home, on holiday, he uses a rope to scale down a cliff to a beach nearby. When he wants to go home, he finds the rope has been cut.  He tries to climb back up the cliff but he falls and injures his ankle.  Soon, another young man comes along and rescues Basil and they become good friends.  How this friendship grows and the outcome was a surprise for me as I can usually figure out the plot of most movies.

Jared in his youth playing lead in an English period film is quite an astounding site, especially compared to his current stereotype-smashing works in music and film.  Christian Slater was equally gobsmacking as he appears to haven't aged a bit since this film.

For me, the story was unpredictable in several of its twists and betrayals.  Basil is a story of chicanery, deceit, loneliness, lies and loss; in other words, a very human story.  I enjoyed the macabre darkness of it all.",1477526400,3,585,4.8

1009439,3,6305305765,"Basil, starring Jared Leto and Christian Slater, isn't a movie most film-buffs will probably recognize, even fans of the pair. What even fewer people know is that it was an adaptation of a nineteenth century novel by English novelist Wilkie Collins, which  unlike the vast horde of ignoramuses who also never saw the movie  I happen to have read.

So if you're wondering whether Im gonna be that guy, the answer is Oh heck yes I AM gonna be that guy, but with a crucial caveat.

Most filmmakers tasked with converting a novel from the 1800s to a film palatable to todays viewers take the low road. The easy way out. They Bay-ize the plot and modernize the characters and in doing so strip the themes entirely. The end result is at best a somewhat decent movie which shares many similarities to an amazing novel, but with a lot more zing. Sometimes they just literally throw in explosions, or zombies, or whatever, which if you ask me (nobody has) might be the better way of going about it. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, at the very least, does not purport to be a straight take on Austin, nor does it affect any high-class bearing.

That isn't what happened with Basil at all. They didn't try to make it more exciting, or to really change anything, for that matter.

Which is itself a failure in adaptation, since they're taking a novel several hundred pages long and condensing it into ninety minutes. Obviously some fundamental changes are required to trim the fat and focus on the meat of the story. If you dont, you end up with the 98 adaptation of Basil: a flat, obtuse take on nuanced literature (whose themes, quite frankly, didn't have a lot to offer your average 21st century moviegoer in the first place).

The eponymous hero is played by Jared Leto, of recent wide (but undeserved) acclaim for his miniscule role in the latest Superhero crapfest, Suicide Squad. The first sequence, however, features Basils boyhood and a series of traumas brought on by his over-bearing aristocratic father. The fathers shown browbeating any sign of creativity or independence from Basil, culminating when he exiles and disowns Basils older brother for the crime of loving a woman below his station.

The very next scene reveals his hypocrisy and the root of his prejudice: yup, you guessed it, fornicating with one of the serving girls out on the manor grounds.

By the time Jared Leto steps into Basils shoes its obvious hes on the path to rebellion. A chance meeting with mysterious John Mannion from London (Christian Slater) kicks Basils rebellion into full gear. John introduces Basil to a common mans world, an experience utterly foreign to the sheltered nobleman which culminates when John introduces Basil to Julia Sherwin (Claire Forlani). Despite her cold reception, Basils instantly infatuated by Julia, and to add fuel to the narrative fire, shes the daughter of a London merchant. Sure, her house makes mine look like a refrigerator box in an alleyway, but a London merchant is to an aristocrat what Burger King is to a five-star steakhouse. The forbidden love blossoms over the course of several scenes, delving into a world of intrigue and betrayal which Basils father wouldnt have approved of even if it was all roses and daisies, which its anything but. Julia Sherwin, one way or another, is bound to be his ruin.

(Sidenote: I racked my brain for a specific example in the above metaphor, but I guess Im just a clueless pauper: the nicest steak-house Ive ever set foot in was a particularly well-appointed Longhorn with a killer porterhouse.)

Radha Bharadwaj ambitiously produced, wrote, and directed Basil, and I think its obvious from the film that he was in over his head. They Bay-ize some of it, sure, replacing a few of the novels turning points and climaxes with scenes more likely to appeal to the modern audience which these days won't settle for anything less than over-the-top. But its not as if Bharadwaj butchered the thing; I cant point to any single example so egregious as to claim theyve fundamentally, irreparably ruined the story.

What Basil lacks in every sense is depth and nuance. Wilkie Collins worked in the realm of literary prose, utilizing a set of authorial story-telling tools entirely separate from those in film. It might as well be the difference between a water-color painting and opera. So much of the nuance of character and story is lost when its compressed into a film of any length, and Bharadwajs take is continually flat. The relationship between Basil and John Mannion  despite the underrated Slaters noble attempt to carry the weight of the entire film on his shoulders  ends up looking more like a Buddy Movie or Bromance in the first half of the flick, abandoning novel-Basils infatuation with the enigmatic merchant John Mannion.

Furthermore, Wilkins was a master of the serial and is often cited as singlehandedly inventing the modern detective story. His style is apparent even in a novel as early in his career as Basil, relying on chapter-by-chapter suspense and all the hooks and cliffs youd expect of his more famous contemporary, Dickens. Theres nothing about any single scene in Basils adaptation which hooked me or left me on a cliff; it drags ponderously, even for a historical drama. The twist Im sure would have been predictable even to someone unfamiliar with the work.

I cant call the movie a total fail. Im sure a certain audience would eat it up; it would probably do well on Lifetime or Hallmark. But I, if you couldn't tell, am not the kind of person whod be caught dead watching anything on Lifetime.

So no, its not The Hobbit (ugh). Cherished literature hasn't been slaughtered, here. And its a decent movie on its own right. The costumes, scoring and cinematography are all proficient, if not engaging.

Yet in the end its just another middling conversion, and thats probably the best I can say of it.",1473120000,,5888,4.818632309217047

1009970,3,6305305765,"Although I can not give this movie rave reviews, the quality of the actors performances was really very good.

Jared Leto excels at portraying a very naive young man and Christian Slater is excellent as one who is willing to take advantage of that naivete.

Claire Forlani gives a nicely nuanced performance and Derek Jacobi is perfect as the cold and demanding father.  The other supporting roles were also well cast.

Adaptations of classic novels usually veer from the book in order to make the transition from text to  visual media a smoother and more watchable experience for the viewer.  In this case, the adaptation could have been better if the screenwriter had chosen to emphasize certain aspects better suited to the medium rather than others which did not translate as well.

Radha Bharadwaj is both the writer who adapter this Wilkie Collins novel as well as the Director.  This may have been a situation of one person determined to make the movie according to their own vision.  It could have, and should have, been much better.",1466380800,7,1041,4.836158192090395
1009971,2,6305305765,"This is such a melodramatic far-fetched storyline, so hard to wrap one's reason around. The father is unforgiving, cold, disdainful of everyone not of his perceived ilk. Of course social status was a major driver of the period.  He finds his sons annoying and dispensable and dismisses one, then another, from his home and life. But before his banishment, Basil, the second son, makes some choices that only a child or adult playing a board game might make. Really, one must try not to give away the castle, no matter how hot she is!  Another canon Basil ignores is: beware of sly foxes.  Even Little Red Riding Hood puzzled out that equvalent.  I won't spoil further, but it's pretty spoiled as is.",1466294400,2,699,4.704918032786885

The main character is an oblivious, unthinking, idiot, mauling the girl he thinks he ""loves"", and things just get darker and more depressing from there. It did have some surprising plot twists that I didn't expect, but it wasn't enough for me to say ""Wow, that was a good movie.""

I found this to be one of those movies you watch/play and then go to sleep to as it is running in the background. There is not much to miss. What is missing is a language coach or someone to help them with develop their accents to whatever nationality they are representing. It could be America by the sounds of it, but estates and buildings portray somewhere in England?  The dialogue may have been written by a middle school student. The dramatic scenes you hope for are OK at best. Which I think there are about 2. This movie is too much of a copy-cat prototype  of an era that is already well written by those who actually lived in the 19th century. But then that person hid that script in a wall, and then the building burned down, and then perhaps some producer found 1/4th of the story and wanted to bait high profile actors to bring this sad creation to life.  You could mute the movie and understand the story line just as well. This might be best, actually if you plan on watching this movie to gaze into the dreamy blue eyes of Jared Leto.  The flash-back sequence was lame. It is all pretty lame.

It just doesn't quite flow and move along fluidly as a story like this one should.  Adapting, for the screen, a story about an aristocratic father and son at odds over a generation with the son learning some harsh life lessons along the way due to the revenge story that's driving the bus is tricky work, but that's what screen writers and directors  get paid for.

This film, based on Wilkie Collins' gothic novel, may or may not be faithful to the book, but it succeeds as a cinematic achievement. The photography, sets and costumes are wonderful. The music works well. And it is not hard to see some thematic elements from Dickens' Great Expectations (betrayal, the arrogance of aristocracy, a boy becoming a man, disinheritance, etc.). Collins contributed to Dickens' publication, and is credited with being the father of the mystery genre. In the boring greyness of the Industrial Revolution, Collins' plots were exotic and titillating. Even if this film were a failure - far from that - if you were a gay man or a woman who loves watching beauty, Leto's astoundingly beautiful Pre-Raphaelite face, which you can moon over for the duration of the film, would be well worth the price of admission.

It was worth the price to watch Christian Slater, Clare Forlani and Jared Leto.

I saw this movie when it came out (I was 14) and was confused by it and didn't particularly like it, but obviously didn't form a solid opinion of the movie because I rented it again this week to see why I still didn't have an opinion of it.  Now I know why.

The ""mystery"" of the film (spoilers below) has very little to do with the movie itself.  I read in another review that this film is about ""revenge gone wrong"" when in fact this film is about revenge never happening!  The movie provides an endless list of questions that are never answered.

Why is Basil so ridiculously gullible and naive to the point where you're just plain embarrassed for him?

How more could the director possibly spoil his own ""mystery"" with the cut rope near the beginning and Julia's constant hesitations with Basil?

How pathetic is John Manyan's character (big spoiler alert here) to spend his entire life building up to something only to completely give up on it at the last moment for no obvious reason?  Nice justice he brought his father.

Why do Basil and his brother keep in no contact whatsoever?  They appear to be very close early on, and then when sent away, Basil makes no attempts to reconnect with his brother at all.  Clearly he has a desire for a male friend- as this movie takes great pains to point out in his strong and quickly made friendship with John Manyan.  Travel is no issue for Basil- he makes excuses to go to London to see Manyan.  Why would he not go see his brother?

Can Basil's father be any more one-dimensional and any less convincing as a character?  We keep getting this stupid line about ""such-and-such knows their place"" trying to label him as being so stuck up it's the only thing we know about him.  It is so unbelievable that a character who is only identifiable by one characteristic should completely change who he is at the end of the film (especially when this has happened off-screen).

What are we supposed to feel for the father at the end of the film other than the fact that he ruined many lives and no one took their revenge on him?  He gets away with what he has done, and the audience is supposed to somehow find this a ""happy ending"".

Nothing is resolved, and we don't understand several of the main characters.  Clara, the only sympathetic character in the film, never once challenges her foster father's cruelness, and so transitions to just pathetic.  At least Manyan had ambition, though unrealized.

I actually laughed when the credits rolled after Basil said he wanted to stay and live with his dad.

What a waste of everyone's time and talent.",1200355200,22,2664,4.488565488565489
1011025,3,6305305765,"Basil (Radha Bharadwaj, 1998)

After Closetland, I considered Radha Bharadwaj one of the best directors I'd ever seen put images on film. Then... nothing. For seven years, nothing. And then came Basil, about as different a film from Closetland as it is possible to imagine. (And there has been nothing in the nine years since.)

Based on a Wilkie Collins novel, Basil is the story of, well, Basil (Jared Leto), an aristocrat whose father (Derek Jacobi, whose character is never named in the film) is an overbearing, class-obsessed bonehead. We see some stuff about Basil's young (read: played by someone younger than Jared Leto) life, then get into the meat of the story-- Basil, whose only friend is foundling Clara (Rachel Pickup), taken in by Basil's family at a young age, is rescued after injuring his ankle in a fall by John Mannion (Christian Slater). The two of them become close, and Basil ends up falling for Julia (Claire Forlani), the daughter of Mannion's employer. Julia may not be so sure about Basil, but she certainly likes his money...

The most interesting thing about Basil is Clara, who is an artifact of an earlier time; while Basil (and his contemporaries in so many Victorian novels) are off pursuing the women who are bad for them, there's the lovely childhood friend waiting at home who these guys simply never notice. In a rather Tristan-and-Isolde move, we even get blonde Clara and raven-haired Julia. Oh, the symbolism. By saying this, though, I don't mean to denigrate the movie, nor the novel on which it is based; this is the kind of thing that passed for melodrama in the Victorian novel. It's stupidly fun, and one has to assume Bharadwaj offers the heavy-handed symbolism in the spirit in which it was originally offered.

More problematic is listening to both Leto and Slater try and fumble their ways through their particular accents. Oddly, it's Leto, who at the time was a rising star (he was still a couple of years away from the trilogy of films that would make his name-- The Thin Red Line, Fight Club, and Requiem for a Dream), who seems to have less of a problem with it; he dons the accent, and the mantle, of the aristocrat without terribly much trouble, while established star Slater never quite manages to play the lower-class wage slave convincingly. (And, while it's impossible to give details without major spoilers, yes, I do realize there's a reason for that, but all that does is shift the blame from one party to another.)

Still, minor casting problems aside, I enjoyed this for what it is; a drama of manners, a lightweight mystery. I've never been a big fan of the Merchant-Ivory Victorian costume dramas that were all the rage for a decade or so; maybe, as it turns out, I just needed another director at the helm. *** ",1198108800,,2779,4.743271221532091
1011026,3,6305305765,"I haven't read this Wilkie Collins story, but I found it intriguing and for the most part enjoyed it.  The one problem I had was with Christian Slater.  I am a big fan of Slater but this was a terrible miscast.  Instead of a turn-of-the-century English man, he was obviously a modern American.  Just didn't work - that surprised me.

Fast-paced in an enervated way, the opening is startling one dimensional enough to be painful.  Mercifully, it gathers momentum and becomes if not intriguing, certainly, not characterless or tedious.

Slater, is suitable; Leto comes with a certain distance wholly appropriate for the part.  Foriani (Julia) was capable enough for me to want to throttle her character...a very good sign I'd say.

Clearly, the tempo was off, nonetheless, as the plot unfolded (for those of us who haven't read the book)'Basil' becomes more low-key melodrama and middle-end gothic, in very pleasing and agreeable way, as the threads of the narrative are sorted out.

I was quite keen on 'Basil'.",1175040000,,891,5.283687943262412
1011028,3,6305305765,"Based on Wilkie Collins' 1852 novel, ""Basil"" stars Jared Leto as the hero of the title.  Basil, son of rich and aristcratic father Derek Jacobi, falls in love with beautiful but mystrious girl Julia (Claire Forlani).  The problem is, Basil knew that his stern father would never acknowledge the daughter of merchant as his future bride, so in spite of his better judgment and advice from his friend Manion (Christian Slater), he continues his relations a secret until terrible truth is found out.

As is with many Collins' novels, the story is melodramatic and full of surprises, but the film seems to be too full of them.  Every five minute you see something happen, which is certainly enjoyable.  However, as far as emotional power goes, ""Basil"" is far from convincing.  When the film should be sensual, it fails to be so, leaping to the next scene without raising the tension that should have come from, say, the clandestine meetings between Basil and Julia.  There is no thrilling descriptions of ever-changing love and distrust found in works like ""Wings of the Dove."" The same can be said about the frail father-son relation in Basil's family, which should have been more explored.

My material says the writer/director Radha Bharadwaj (known for Madeleine Stowe film ""Closet Land"") was very impressed with the original book when she was 12 years old.  Born and raised in India, the director clearly is conscious of social class and gender, so the book's thriller part is reduced to certain degree, and instead the contrast between men and women, or traditional aristocracy and new middle-class is stressed.

Her decision is understandable, but I don't know if it was a good idea to adapt the novel that way.  And you should know that ""Basil"" is usually considered as one of Wilkie's juvenile works (only his second novel published during his lifetime)  His major works are still ""The Moonstone"" or ""The Woman in White"" both of which are filmed in 1990s for British TV.  So why ""Basil""?  That part remains vague after watching the film.

The best thing in the film is no doubt Claire Forlani. But her fans should be told beforehand that though Ms. Forlani in blue costume (standing besides beautiful birds) is gorgeous and exquisite, her charms do not materialize to the full because of too fast speed of story.  Chrstian Slater (who also co-produced) and Jared Leto are not so bad, handsome as ever, but it is painfully obvious that they are Americans.

One final word for Collins fans.  Don't get angry.  The film takes GREAT liberty when it shows Clara not as Basil's sister; when Margaret Sherwin is changed to Julia Sherwin (does this mean that 'Margaret' is no longer a popular name?); and when Manion walks outside without a hat on his head even though you know that no confidential clerk of respectable merchant does that.

As Victorian constume drama ""Basil"" is just a so-so film.  You don't have to hurry to watch it. Basil's elder brother Ralph is played by Crispin Bonham Carter, cousin of Helena.",1064448000,40,3015,4.849609375

I didn't find it dull at all, so I guess I will be one of the few people who thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Christian Slater did a fine job - as usual, and I found the ending to be sweet.
Had the lead character found someone to love, I would have given the movie 5 stars.",986256000,40,498,4.071428571428571

7887509,2,6305305765,"Poor writing, cliche-ridden dialogue, predictable plot, unsatisfying conclusion -- all the things that make it not worth the time to watch. At least 3 times during the movie, I wanted to turn it off, but watched to the end just to see if maybe it would improve. It didn't. Christian Slater was wasted in this pedestrian flick, and Jared Leto has a perpetually perplexed expression.",1525996800,,381,4.876923076923077
7887510,1,6305305765,"The worst acting, the most ridiculous plot and the main character sounded as if he was a non-englishman pretending to be English.",1522454400,,129,4.909090909090909
7887511,3,6305305765,"acting was not good. The story line was that of a high school drop out.. but if you want something to put you to sleep this is a good movie to watch. Though I might add Slater's acting was not his best , was still ok ... due note that the producers should have given more motivation to the actors .. yes this movie was slow and boring. I mean really giving away the manor who would do that from any walk of fame..",1519516800,,413,3.9285714285714284

7887514,2,6305305765,"As a fan of the 3 lead actors, I watched it hoping for the best... it was not good.  I actually found myself laughing at the end.  I would have to guess it is the directors fault.  No time taken to develop characters, each scene hastily done and slapped together in sloppy sequence.  I would love to see this story redone.",1517788800,,322,4.229508196721311
