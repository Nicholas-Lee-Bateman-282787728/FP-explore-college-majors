7430476,5,B0158W4NT8,"I had a feeling I should go ahead and buy this movie and that I would really like it if I did. So, I went ahead and bought the digital copy of 90 Minutes In Heaven and Yes...I really thought it was a great movie! It would be considered a Christian movie to many but there's more to it than the Christian aspect.  It's about not giving up and finding the strength to carry on even when you feel you cannot continue. I enjoyed seeing Hayden Christensen in this role as well as Kate Bosworth. Yes I recommend this movie. It's uplifting, has a great message, and is just a great story.  Whether or not you believe it to be a true story...well, that's up to you to decide. :)",1447718400,30,670,4.1461538461538465

7430478,4,B0158W4NT8,"After being pronounced dead at the scene of a horrific accident with a tractor trailer, this pastor has a near-death experience. An associate pastor from his church prays and sings with him and discovers that he is alive, much to the consternation of those medical experts and law enforcement on the scene. Pastor Piper experiences tremendous pain, loses his home, and his children temporarily move to live with his wife's parents. I would recommend reading his book as well. I was impressed with the movie as Pastor Piper elaborates upon his near-death experience and his life demonstrates the willingness of other Christians in his church who really came to their assistance during a difficult time of need. God provided him with the faith that he needed to persevere.",1444780800,24,770,5.0234375

7430480,5,B0158W4NT8,"This is just a wonderful movie. I have just finished watching it at the movie mall, and I can't express the wonderful and joyous experience that it caused each one of our youth group, it just gives you a wonderful sense of the peace and love that only faith in Our Lord and God Jesus Christ can give. It is a story about a young man who died and experienced coming face to face with The One True God of the Universe and all creation Our Lord Jesus Christ , it was an experience that changed him forever to the extent that this overwhelming experience of his changed his outlook, his family life and his whole community. I recpmmend this movie to any serious thinker who wants more in life than what the material world can give. Dr. Hany",1442102400,55,736,4.302158273381295
7430481,1,B0158W4NT8,"If you were thinking of going to the movies to see 90 Minutes in Heaven, don't bother. I went tonight - boring. Time it began was 4:00 with the preview trailers, so must have started around 4:15. Began with a short summary of what happened 2 days before his accident took maybe 10-15 minutes. Then the accident and from there it was all in the hospitals with him in surgery or just laying in bed. There was only 1 minute where we saw a brief moment of his thoughts where it appeared to be a vision of heaven with people saying ""Good to see you"" to him, but there was no mention by him in the movie about having seen heaven at all. Through the whole movie there was a child talking and clanging his toys on the chairs and floor. Parent didn't do anything about it. I finally gave up and went out to see what time it was - it was already 5:30 and nothing to indicate any story of his 90 minutes in heaven. I asked for and received a refund.",1442016000,13,938,4.103260869565218
7430482,5,B0158W4NT8,"I think faith-based movies are definitely getting better production quality over time.  This one has all the artistic marks of a well-produced film.  More than that, I am encouraged by how faith-based movies are gaining a wider range of themes.  This is one of those rare faith-based movies that focuses on daily choices of attitude without any of the monumental turning points in relationships that most of em have.  There are turning points in relationships, but not to quite the heightened extent which a lot of stories have.  Furthermore, this is a film that can hold an audience when most of the movie is focused on a mans convalescence after he dies and comes back to life.  That is not an easy thing to do:  keeping an audiences rapt attention for long scenes on an injured face with relatively few words being spoken.

This is the story of Don Piper, a pastor in his 30s who had a fatal car crash in rainy weather in 1989.  Hayden Christensen would not have been what Id envision for Don Piper, because of the cadence of his voice, but his acting skill is strong as he plays a character whos in great pain and vulnerability.  Don Piper did not have a near death experience, but an actual death and return to life.  Of course there will be skeptics about that, but I think there are enough components to the story which compel one to believe a miracle occurred.  He died, but another man on that road felt compelled to pray for him as he lay dead in the vehicle, and his pulse came back.  Then, amid an extremely complicated set of surgeries, intense pain, and strain on his family, it became much worse when he could not find his own will to live.  This storys primary conflict is internal, his search for a will to live.  His own attitude prevents him from seeing the great gift God gave him by allowing him to experience heaven and return to share about it.  Hes just resentful that he cant be in heaven already, that God brought him back to suffer and have to rely on other people.  As he admits to a character played by Fred Thompson, who enters his life shortly after hes finally ready to submit to God, he thought he was doing everyone a favor by cutting himself off from them, fearing hed be just a burden.  His stubborn refusal to open himself up emotionally to others caring for him mirrors Peters refusal to let Jesus wash his feet (John 13).  It really surprised me how much Piper almost ruined his closest relationships as he recovered.  His listless desire to escape suffering was much more damaging to his loved ones (friends and family) than his neediness/reliance on them.

There is strong dramatic tension in the movie because of how strained his relationships get.  Its not an emotionally draining kind of movie, though, and I felt like I went through the journey with him, instead of just watching him go through it.  Through it all, characters keep feeling Gods calling to help him toward renewed faith in God.  This is ironic, because his experience of heaven should have strengthened his faith in God all on its own.  I love how his discovery of a new purpose, sharing his experience of heaven with the world to give them hope, comes AFTER he has gotten past his attitude problems.  In nearly every situation in life, a persons attitude has to change before the circumstances change:  in some mysterious way, we create our own destiny, or God opens up blessings after we have our hearts right, or a combination of the two.

90 Minutes in Heaven spoke to me in a special way that transcended emotional manipulation.  I am looking forward to seeing it again.",1441929600,167,3586,4.568075117370892

So if your into ""meaning"" this movie is for you.  If you are into Roger Eberts couch slob fast action scripts with little depth, well, maybe this movie is not for you.  Yes, Ebert gave this a two star.  Why did a devout athiest like Ebert ever watch it to begin with?  Maybe because Satan told him too.

7430596,5,B0158W4NT8,"If you like ""Faith-Based Movies"" that have good acting in them, then you will like this movie.  I won't go through the synopsis of the movie, as you can read that in the product description, but I will tell you that you will find good, believable acting and a well written script with solid directing. This is a great Family Movie that will reinforce Your Belief in Heaven and our Creator Heavenly Father!
If you don't share that belief? It is still a good movie that if free from a lot of violence and foul language.

7430597,1,B0158W4NT8,"This movie is absolutely the most misleading in concept that I have ever witnessed. The acting is cheesy and forced; the characters are totally unbelievable and pathetic. Who ever heard of a wife who works so the family would have medical insurance and then doesn't understand the process and can't fill out a form--both the husband and the wife are self-indulgent, inane presences in this poorly scripted, directed and edited movie. There is little about heaven that couldn't have been conceived by an elementary school student, and even the celestial portion was cheesy with overly simple concepts and downright intellectual insult. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BUY THIS MOVIE!! Come to my house and I'll give it to you for free just to get rid of it. I doubt any self-respecting library would want it.

I understand that Christian dramas aren't meant to be big budget blockbusters, but if you manage to get Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth to star in them, the least you could do is make sure they have lines worth speaking.  The screenplay was garbage.  And finally, what the heck was up with Donald Piper's mustache? This looks like something my dad sported in the 70's.  It bothered me... like DISTRACTINGLY bothered me.  He reminded me of Eric Robert's character in Star 80 and gave me the creeps.  I managed to finish the movie... just barely.  I wouldn't recommend it.",1497571200,,713,4.739837398373984

7430651,1,B0158W4NT8,"Great perseverance but where is Christ in this. This gift of life isn't for us to find our purpose for ourselves,  it is to live out God's purpose for us. Heaven is glorified in this movie as oh so beautiful and yet nowhere in the movie does it lead to sharing the gospel and repentance and how to receive eternal salvation.  It went right along with how the world sees things rather than how scripture sees it. God didn't take him to heaven to come back to share his story to encourage others. It isn't about us. It's about him.  The movie doesn't align with scripture and how death is referenced in the bible.  I think severe trauma can cause us to think one thing happened when really another did. God doesn't play with us and give us a sneak peak into heaven.  Nowhere in scripture does it say that. But it does clearly lay out what happens when we die. Come on people.  Stop glamorizing hollywood and a tragic accident and glamorize God. The movie focused on self and not God. Really disappointed.",1486166400,,1002,4.418478260869565

7430700,5,B0158W4NT8,Really a genuine Christian move. It is portrayed true to life. The lead character  undergoes a miracle and iss brought back to life by God. He was pronounced dead after being in a head on collision with an 18 wheeler that runs right over him and smashes his car almost beyond recognition. He had to indure 34 surgeries to restore his body back to working order. He keeps his love and faith in God.,1479859200,,397,4.364864864864865

7430726,2,B0158W4NT8,I was excited to watch this movie after reading the inspirational book but I ended up fast-fowarding through a lot of the bulk of this film.  There was SO MUCH unnecessary footage that I think could have been condensed; I got bored.  The feel of the film was more melancholy than I expected; I was half expecting intense crash scenes and intense recovery scenes with family dynamic.  It had some of that but it was missing something.  I'd recommend spending the time reading the book vs. watching the movie.,1476489600,3,507,4.662921348314606

7430775,2,B0158W4NT8,"The bonus section of the DVD described the film as a combination of two separate books, Don's book, 90 Minutes in Heaven and his wife's book, A Walk Through the Dark, in which she shared the transformative effect of shared pain on herself and her family.  If the film had come even close to portraying Don's book and his experience of heaven, I would have bought it as a gift for countless people. After viewing this film however, I will not be giving it to anyone: the film contained almost nothing about Don Piper's experience of heaven as described in his own book but rather gave the viewer a relentless walk through the dark; it was very graphic in its presentation of the injuries and the torturous hospitalizations; it was far too slow, and it focused on one excruciatingly painful episode after another. LOVED the book, and Don's interviews on YouTube are wonderful, but the film was a big disappointment.",1472342400,,913,4.70625

Piper had a great deal of pain from all of his injuries but I think seeing him in the hospital and everything he went through really brought home how awful the accident was and the toll it took on him and his family.  This is a story of one man's faith challenged and how he realized what God wanted him to do.  His family also suffered although in different ways.  I was a little put out that they didn't show heaven at the beginning of the movie, but after the movie was over I realized that they were letting me go through the process with him, just as his family and friends did, why he kept asking to go home, before hearing about heaven.  Then we all understood part of his agony.  Many thanks to Rev. Piper and his family for sharing his journey with us.",1470873600,4,857,4.132530120481928

Poor, wonderful, Dwight Yoakim tried his best to embody the attorney character in an interesting, funny way, but the direction of this movie just fell flat on top of him. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MAJOR DUD.... INSTEAD; Watch the fabulous wonderful movies:

7430824,3,B0158W4NT8,"I like the story. It was hard to pay attention to at times because the movie is soooo slow. They really emphasized the pain and struggle of the man who died but the movie was lacking in feeling with everyone else. The visit to heaven could of lasted longer and told more about what he experienced. Since the man who died was dead for 90 minutes, It could of lasted more than 5 minutes. I think that the heaven scene is the main scene that most people want to see unfortunately it was very short. It was moving at parts but I would not watch this movie again.",1468281600,,558,4.175925925925926

7430827,2,B0158W4NT8,"The only reason I am giving this two stars, instead of one, is the performance of Kate Boswoth. She is a wonderful actress. She made stilted, stiff, overly obvious dialogue work  (a miracle in itself). Better writing would have elevated the story to the level it so richly deserved. The director needs to go back to writing school. And, he needed to get better performances out of the rest of the cast  (are they all amateurs or just bad actors?) Hayden Christensen is absolutely awful. There was not one believable moment in his performance. As Roger Ebert said, ""He is only good at playing phonies."" Too bad he was a playing a man that was so richly complex. He doesn't have the acting chops for it. Don Piper seems like a wonderful, God loving man, and his story needs to be heard. Too bad it was made with these producers. A documentary may have been more emotionally fulfilling.",1468022400,,883,4.582278481012659

I've heard Don Piper speak about heaven on YouTube and it was fascinating -- this movie is slow and boring.  I am baffled how a writer and producer could boil down an amazing story into something so dull and lifeless.  Four of us watched it together tonight and we all realized it was a mistake.

7430888,3,B0158W4NT8,"I remember stopping at one hour and 12 minutes.  I reviewed the movie in my mind and figured they could have cut 42 of those minutes, and probably should have.  The last 40-45 minutes of the movie is worth the emotional response, and all the better if you're Christian.  Make no mistake, this is a ""Christian"" movie, plenty of prayer and the kinds of things you'll hear from many good church folks.

I understand the one star reviews, it was tedious. It could be edited to 60 or 70 minutes and come out with a more powerful movie, but I'm not the one doing to work, so if you want to get what you hoped for, you'll have to get through the first hour and twelve minutes... shortly after that I was enjoying the movie.

What saddens me, is I understand writing, drama, entertainment.  And as you can see from the reviews, much of the audience is not going to forgive the level of tedious boredom and inability to care for your damaged protagonist that goes on so long. That's what sticks with them. A much more stronger emotional response to the early lack of entertainment than the last 30-40 minutes that provoked a strong enough emotional response to forgive the tedious beginning for me.",1462406400,,1189,4.506976744186047

7430909,1,B0158W4NT8,"You know what false advertising is, right?  Or when advertisers bate and switch?  Judging by the title of this movie, you would think it was based on the book which is largely about a guy's near death experience in heaven after he died in a car crash.  Well, they don't get to the ""heaven "" part until 140 minutes into the movie.  And before that is a lot badly written boring talk that would make even the most patient of people's head explode or put them to sleep, whichever comes first.  And when they do get to the Heaven part it's only 5 lousy minutes.  And heaven is so badly lazily rendered.  All they do is put a hazy dream filter over the camera and show his relatives pass by the camera smiling while we hear his voice over.  Ugh.  I thought a movie with Hayden Christensen (From Star Wars) would have a higher production value than this trash.  Why do most all Christian themed movies all tend to suck?  Doesn't Jesus want them to succeed?  Perhaps they should have hired a jew or two to direct and write.  Now, those folks know how to make movies!!!  I really wanted to like this movie, too. But, sadly, it was a dog.  No, not even a dog.  It was dog poop.  Even Jesus in Heaven is cringing at this movie.  Want hope in an afterlife?  I suggest the book.  Now that IS actually about Heaven, unlike the movie.  Jesus can forgive a lot of sins, but I don't know how anyone, even him, could forgive this movie.",1461456000,5,1419,4.2593984962406015

I couldn't believe that though the title was ""90 minutes in Heaven"", the movie version was about 90-95% about the main character's time in the hospital...not even talking about his time in Heaven until the last few minutes. I would even say it got to be boring...going over and over his physical trauma in the hospital. I wish they would have spent more time talking about HEAVEN and his time there, which is what the movie is about. If people don't read the book before seeing this, they will be sadly disappointed, and not learn much about this man's time in Heaven at all. READ THE BOOK...you'll be glad you did, because it was WONDERFUL... a true, great story!!",1461196800,,749,4.639097744360902

7430918,5,B0158W4NT8,"We so enjoyed watching this wonderful movie. This Christian movie is uplifting, and affirming. A five star rating is well deserved,as the movie was well written, extremely well acted by all envolved. Rose",1460937600,,204,5.212121212121212
7430919,2,B0158W4NT8,"90 minutes in heaven is a secular movie made up to look like a Christian movie.  They completely left out his experience in heaven except for a couple of glimpses.  They made his experience in heaven a dream rather than a true vision or a true happening as the book made it.  They made the lead character somewhat a whiny baby throwing a tempertantrum,  which I didn't get from the book.  Both lead actors are not Christians,  and to play those rules properly,  I believe,  the people playing them needed to be Christians.  The acting was pitiful,  the movie was boring,  and unbelievable,  which is what their motive was all along.  All of the Christian visions, stories from the Bible, miracles throughout history,  are not real, they're just figment of the imagination.  I mean they even had the lead character questioning shatter what happened to him was real or not.  So,  the moral of their story was,  believe in faith if you want to,  it doesn't really mean anything.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  G-d  IS in control.  HE does intercede for us,  HE does listen to prayer,  and He does respond to prayer.  There is no more powerful tool that we have in this world than prayer.  All odd the weapons,  the planes the nuclear books and missiles, all of the training that goes into training or warriors is completely USELESS against the Lord G-d  Almighty,  the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the creator of all of the laws of physics,  quantum physics,  so called natural laws,  everything that governs the entire universe and how it works was written by G-d  on the fourth day of creation when He made the sun, the moon,  and the stars.  Just as when He created life,  He wrote the code of life.  A code so advanced that we still have no idea what it really means.  We have barely scratched the surface of the DNA code,  and found another code which governs the DNA code.  What the secular scientists refuse to tell you is that their is more information on one stand of DNA than in all of the entire collection of the Library  of Congress,  more information than a room full odd super computers can contain.  And these secular scientists would have you believe that this information just popped into existence from the random mixing of different chemicals 2 billion years ago.  The laws of statistics and of chance make this random mixing of chemicals forming DNA, and thus the first single cell lifeforms,  is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE!!! Not just unlikely,  not difficult,  not improbable b but ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!! They have a problem however,  since they refuse to believe in the Creator, they must figure out some way to make the universe work without G-d.  They believe they had it with evolution.  However,  DNA, was the death nail in the theory of evolution. Not just a problem to solve,  or a hiccup,  but the end to the evolutionary idea.  That is why these so called scientists have begun to look to aliens as the origins to all life on earth.  Yeah, that could do it.  However,  sooner or later,  no mayest how you put it off with aliens,  ore costs and asteroids seeing the earth and creating life,  you still come to the problem of life popping into existence out of nothing,  you silk have the problems of spontaneous generation of life which DNA PROVES ABSOLUTELY PROVES TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.  If they can figure it out using science they will go straight to science fiction.  My goodness,  they refuse to call a cave painting of a dinosaur,  or a relief,  or a statue of a dinosaur a dinosaur,  because dinosaurs existed 65 million years before man.  It doesn't matter that the evidence is right in front of their face,  they refuse to see what is right there. If G-d came and stood before them,  talked to them, whatever, they would refuse to admit that He was G-d, because to them G-d  does not exist. People used to argue that air didn't exist.  It can't be seen or smelled,  or touched. Rehashed of the fact that they could see is effects,  breathe it in,  feel it on their faces they just wouldn't believe.  Or when the ancient Greek philosophores discovered that the earth was in the shape of a ball,  and even accurately measured the earth's size,  the people still would not believe it,  it was obvious that the earth was flat.  It is the same with secular scientists today they think it's obvious that the earth and life and all odd the universe is a chance happening,  when is so very obvious that someone created it all. And that someone IS G-d, the creator,  the Lord of Lords,  the King of Kings,  the Alpha and the Omega,  or Savior,  or Master and Redeemer.  Check out his guide to the earth,  life,  how we should live,  what we should do,  it is called in English The Bible.  A book the is also a miracle and absolute proof of the resistance of G-d, but that's for another time.",1460937600,,4837,4.53030303030303

I am glad the profit goes to charity. I was going to show it to my 7th grade RE class but not much shows heaven. ""Heaven is for Real"" was better and the students really liked that DVD as did I. For 90 Minutes in Heaven I may show them only the part on heaven rather than the entire movie as if I fast forward to 135 that is when heaven is shown on the DVD, For being in heaven 90 minutes, not much is told about it. It is amazing the man came back to life when the bystander stopped and prayed for him. I believe that bystander might have been a preacher. I read the book a few years ago and the book was like that too, not a whole lot about his memory of heaven.

The interview with the real  Don Piper came across as even more depressing. I got that they were a close family, fine. But even when he talks he doesn't seem convinced at all with what he supposedly wrote about. WHY was heaven such a sacred experience that was not worthy of talking about or writing about for 14 yrs???? That makes NO sense to me, especially if he was a Pastor. I would think as a believer he would be thrilled to testify, but he comes across embarrassed by the whole experience. If it was so sacred and personal, than keep it to yourself because it came across very unbelievable when he spoke about it. I get that he was in pain, which was horrific. But after I watched the interview with the family, his story lost all credibility with me",1455235200,2,1032,4.341968911917099
7431011,3,B0158W4NT8,"The message of God's faithfulness in both this movie and the book upon which it was based, is evident..  However, just as in the book, the story lingers a bit too long on the years and months of suffering, depression, and despair encountered during this very difficult trial.  No doubt this is, in actuality, what this precious man of God experienced.  Because of all that God brought him through, as presented near the end of the film, he now has a heart to comfort others with the same comfort with which God ministered to him.",1455235200,,529,4.5473684210526315

If the wife acted like a zombie during the aftermath of the accident, then she had a great performance. I felt so badly for the wife, never being able to let her feelings show, only late at night, at a MacDonald's drivethru?  I get that she was very strong, and admire it, just felt really bad for her.

I love buying faith based flicks because I want to support them and those that make them. This one however is a real stinker.
 The entire movie revolves around Donald Piper's horrific crash and recovery which was quite brutal. It only talked about his journey to Heaven for roughly ninety SECONDS! I kid you not. I couldn't believe it. What a disappointment.
 Also, they only whispered through the whole thing so throughout the entire movie I just kept turning the volume up and up and up.
 Please don't waste your money or time with this movie. It didn't even deserve the one star i gave it but you can not not give it at least one.

7431052,3,B0158W4NT8,I was very disappointed with this movie. I read the book and the book was captivating. This movie skipped out on a lot of the important factors in the book like heaven does exist and heaven is for real. The whole premise for the movie was what this man experienced when he died and went to heaven for 90 minutes I did not get that at all from the movie. I came away with his experience after he died and the 90 minutes in heaven didn't even really get explained until the very ending of the movie. When he's telling his pastor friend about his experience in heaven for the first time the pastor friend looks at him and says tell me about your 90 minutes in heaven and I'm thinking this is the first time this man is telling anybody anything when did 90 minutes even get mentioned. That must've just been thrown in there for the title of the movie. The car crash scene about someone holding his hand didn't even have an impact again until the end of the movie. If that was an important factor in the movie for him and him telling his story then it should have been better directed better thought out. The movie left me feeling like I wasted my money.,1454198400,,1149,4.251141552511416

Every person was so disgusting that it actually was real for me.  Look, if you are hurt that bad, your most trusted should be sweetly oiling you and reading you the Book of the Dead by candle light.  But what do they you?  Unimaginable torture and evil, then condemn you for not being  thankful to be alive. If you drag someone out of heaven,  creeps...you had BETTER be willing to shut your mouth forever and be their slave.  The whole praying crap!

It was NOT about Heaven or Eternal Life or God or anything but the character for the first hour and a half, at which time I realized I no longer CARED about any of it and just wanted to put him out of my misery - and then I realized I could do exactly that by turning it off.  So I did.  The worst part is I stayed in a bad mood from watching it for the rest of the evening and I lost an hour and a half of my life watching it...and $19 buying it : ( .

Although I am sure the movie carries an inspirational message of hope and faith but it does not provide a clear overview or much of a glimpse of the 90 minutes spent in heaven In fact I think there was about a 3-4 minute mention of heaven in the movie and it was towards the end. My husband tried to watch this movie but he said it was to slow and didn't provide much information. Sadly he got up and went to bed with 45 minutes left of the movie. If you are hoping to have that feel good feeling or goosebumps like Heaven is for Real this is not the movie for you. You will be disappointed unfortunately.

Twenty minutes into this movie and it becomes a very emotional. You will feel like you are on the verge of tears for most of this movie. The accident is very graphic. The recovery is slow. But in the end this movie shows the power of prayer.

Also Don Piper's wife's commitment to him is spectacularly moving. She makes such difficult decisions and endures her husband's depression and stonewalling. The frustration really gets to both of them but somehow they pull through.

I felt this was a thoughtful movie. The lessons you learn from this story are profound. If you've ever asked why God allows suffering or asked if prayer really works, this is the movie for you.

Now as far as heaven goes there are only a few minutes about heaven. You will only see heavenly gates and a few deceased relatives and friends.

7431145,4,B0158W4NT8,"I was hoping to see what I had read in the book, but the movie left out much of what is in the book. There is less than five minutes of heaven in the movie. The rest is about Don Piper's excruciating pain and turmoil after the experience of heaven. They left out the best part of the book, heaven but this seems to happen often when a book is made into a movie. I hate to say it but I must. Having read the book first I was to a point disappointed with the movie. If you haven't read the book I suggest you do so. It is a very uplifting book. The book and the movie are just to far apart. Don't misunderstand me there is much to like in this movie with regard to God's helping us through hard times. I just would have liked to have seen the part which is in the book about what Mr. Piper saw while he was in heaven for 90  minutes. NOTE: There is one thing this book and movie has given me. In all my many, many, years of law enforcement how many times have I been sent to an auto accident where often there would be one and some times several deaths. Never did I pray for the dead. The families that did not yet know of their loss I prayed for, but never the dead. After reading the book ""90 Minutes in Heaven and seeing the movie I will at least pray not only for the families, but also for the dead. I have learned from this book and movie you never know what God has in mind. After all God does use his people to do His will. As a Christian I live and I learn. If for no other reason watch this movie and see how God can help you through the hardest of places.

7431148,5,B0158W4NT8,"This movie is about Heaven, alright- but it is about making a Heaven of this Earth, rather than about watching a ninety-minute special-effects version of the Heaven that Rev. Piper saw when he died that day back in 1989.

I almost always read the reviews of the movies I buy or rent here on Amazon.  I read the reviews of this movie, and I felt that it would be a good movie for my husband and I to watch. We are both Christian, and are facing some tribulation next month when I undergo a really wretched but much needed spinal repair. I was surprised when I read the other reviews, and my surprise was caused by the fact that so many people seemed disappointed that there wasn't ""more"" about Heaven. I did not agree with these people, because I thought  that the whole movie was about Heaven! We have become excitement junkies, perhaps, when it comes to what we choose to watch on TV and what we rent or go see at the theater. Even being Christian, I felt myself feeling a little let down that this movie was not going to be filled with a mighty, special-effects vision of the Heaven that Rev. Piper saw when he died.

I am hoping that all of you who choose to watch this movie will watch it with the idea of seeing those people around Rev. Piper try to raise him up- not from the dead, but from a Heaven so wondrous that he was depressed to be returned back to Earth. For those of us who are living our day-to-day lives, we often find ourselves struggling with many terrible and difficult events; the loss of a child;  the shooting of innocent people caused by a hatred that runs so deep that we can hardly begin to understand it; we face tests of all kinds- driving tests, school exams, and tests of our patience when our children disobey again, just when we thought that they understood us.

I found my spirit engaged in the movie. I wondered how I would feel if I was the pastor, or his wife, or one of his children or parents. I found tears rolling down my face as I watched a entire church pray through a solid night for Pastor Piper's life. There were many moments when I saw ""A heaven being made of this Earth.""

And I enjoyed the movie a great deal.

I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have- there were little paces that I felt could have been made better. But all in all, I was heartily glad to spend the time watching real people deal with real troubles, and showing the myriad ways that one can help in the face of trouble. I hope you choose to enjoy it, too.

I knew that I had heard the line, ""make a Heaven of this Earth"" somewhere, but I could not remember where. All I found when I researched it was a quote from an old, obscure book called ""The North American Review"", vol. 207. Let me know if you find a more relevant, recent, or more well-known source.
