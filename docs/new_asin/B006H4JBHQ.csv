Just finished watching your video clip ""Master Class 4"", and I got smacked with a very sobering hand of reality which led me to a clearer understanding. I don't know anything...lol

I liken you to the car industry...  You have Engineers, mechanics and driver/owners. Driver/owners, buy a car for looks, comfort and affordability, but they don't truly understand or appreciate what went into making that car...sometimes you have a driver/owner who has a bit more knowledge in the mechanics and they use the info to make better decisions, but that's it... You have mechanics who know what's under the hood, and can fix and replace parts, but don't know why its built the way it is, because its just not what they do... and then you have your Engineers, the guys with the imagination, creativity, wisdom and brains, who can create and develop through understanding all the critical details that will in the end, make the car.

Long and short of it, your an Engineer... and every time I hear you speak...i feel more and more like the teenager in Drivers Ed waiting to learn how to be a driver/owner...lol

We have never met, yet you have always been a mentor to me and have always made yourself open to me in communication. You are truly and this is again one man speaking to another...  I have a decent back ground, I was in the Army for 10 years (Ranger and Drill Sgt.), In Law Enforcement for 12 years (LE Academy, Fugitive/Warrant Division) and now I am the Director of Training for a Security Academy which teaches Police, Security and Military, in addition, I have at least 25 years worth of martial CQC background...so I don't think of my self as a slouch but, you Sir, are someone who just impresses the hell out of me, every time I see something you do.

You are now one of my bucket list items... Sensei, please know you are highly prized and appreciated and I look to meeting you one day.  AND NO... I am not a stalker...hahaha  Merry Christmas Sir and have a wonderful New Year.  And again. thank you for sharing all you know.

God Bless you and keep you safe...
