For that I had contacted the seller and asked how is the quality, the seller responded ""the quality is good"" such a lair and to make it worse this DVD comes with advertising that you have to watch like it or not (which even add's quality is terrible!) .
THIS IS NOT COPY OF ORIGINAL MOVIE, someone made a copy from flimsy TV. I have to blame myself, I knew I shouldn't deal with business as such!! I knew it and I did it, all blames on me, SHAME ON ME",1400716800,,603,3.9508196721311477
