7895003,4,6305760497,"The time of the English Revolution in the 1640's, Oliver Cromwell's time, as in all revolutionary times saw a profusion of ideas from all kinds of sources- religious, secular, the arcane, the fanciful and the merely misbegotten. A few of those ideas however, as here, bear study by modern militants. As the film under review amplifies, True Leveler Gerrard Winstanley's agrarian socialist utopian tracts from the 1640's, the notion of a socialist solution to the problems of humankind has a long, heroic and storied history. The solutions presented by Winstanley had and, in a limited sense, still do represent rudimentary ways to solve the problem of social and economic distribution of the social surplus produced by society. Without overextending the analogy Winstanley's tract represented for his time, the 1600's, what the Communist Manifesto represented for Marx's time-and ours-the first clarion call for the new more equitable world order. And those with property hated both men, with the same venom, in their respective times.

One of the great advances Marx had over Winstanley was that he did not place his reliance on an agrarian solution to the crisis of society as Winstanley, by the state of economic development of his times, was forced to do. Marx, moreover, unlike Winstanley, did not concentrate on the question of distribution but rather on who controlled the means of production a point that all previous theorists had either failed to account for, dismissed out of hand or did not know about. Thus, all pre-Marxist theory is bound up with a strategy of moral as well as political persuasion as a means of changing human lifestyles. Marx posed the question differently by centering on the creation of social surplus so that under conditions of plenty the struggle for daily survival would be taken off the human agenda and other more lofty goals put in its place. Still, with all the True Levelers' weaknesses of program and their improbabilities of success in the 1640's militants today still doff our hats to Winstanley's vision.

Notwithstanding the utopian nature of the experiment discussed above the filmmaker, Kenneth Brownlow, and his associates here have painstakingly, lovingly and with fidelity to the narrative and detail that are known from the researches of the likes of Christopher Hill and George Sabine, among others, that make for an excellent snapshot of what it might have been like up on Winstanley's St. George's Hill long ago. Two things add to that end.

First, the use of black and white highlights the bleak countryside (after all although the land was ""common"" it was waste that the landlord did not find it expedient to cultivate) and the pinched appearances of the ""comrades"" (especially the deeply-farrowed expressions of Miles Harriwell as Winstanley). Secondly, the director has used to the greatest extent possible Winstanley's own pamphlets that dealt with what was going on in Surrey and what his political purposes were (expressed as almost always in those days in religious terms- but taking land in common for use rather than profit is understanding in any language. I might add that the attempts to replicate the costumes of the period, the furnishings and the music round out a job well done.

Note: Part of this DVD contains a section on the hows and whys of the making of the film, including in-depth coverage of its making and commentary by Mr. Brownlow. You are getting this film for the Winstanley reenactment but this section is interesting if you are interested in filmmaking.",1234483200,3,3544,5.084192439862543
7895004,4,6305760497,"Most reviews of Winstanley call the movie more ""interesting"" than ""entertaining,"" and I'd say that that's a pretty fair description of co-directors Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's work here.  Unlike their more (in)famous It Happened Here, which chronicled an alternate-universe Nazi occupation of Britain and is now regarded as perhaps the best amateur movie ever made, Winstanley is far less flamboyantly provactive.  Focusing on the relatively obscure Gerrard Winstanley, a 17th-century advocate for land reform and communal living, and his failed attempt to put his theories into practice in 1649, this movie is simply less compelling than It Happened Here.  Although the historic Winstanley was a major influence on British socialists like William Morris and E.P. Thompson, his story doesn't lend itself well to a cinematic interpretation.

Yet I find Winstanley to be superior to It Happened Here in many ways:  the acting is more subtle, Brownlow and Mollo have a firmer grasp of their craft, and the sound recording equipment is much better.  Parts of this movie are extraordinarily beautiful, especially the opening battle montage and some of the scenes depicting Winstanley's followers laboring in the fields.  The cover on the DVD compares the film to the work of Kubrick, who apparently encouraged Brownlow and Mollo, but Winstanley is more aligned with the aesthetics of Eisenstein -- right down to the borrowing of Prokofiev's music from Alexander Nevsky.  Only the abruptness of the ending, which leaves the motivations of Winstanley's opponents and his own life story a little vague, came as a disappointment to me.

I realize that all of this sounds rather academic, and it is.  But it's definitely worth a look if you have any interest in independent movie-making.  In fact, since Milestone has packaged this DVD along with the making-of documentary It Happened Here Again, which is actually more interesting than Winstanley itself, this DVD is a must-see for budding film-makers.  The docu describes just what lengths Brownlow and Mollo went to to transfer their vision to the screen -- from raising money to renting rare breeds of pigs in order to remain historically accurate.  It's fascinating stuff, and it gives hope that, in such a cynical industry, dedicated people CAN make experimental and deeply personal movies.

Milestone's DVD is a pretty good one, considering that it's a relatively early one (from 2000).  It's full-frame, as intended.  And although there's noticeable damage to the print, particularly at reel change-overs, the transfer is clean and rich.  There don't seem to be any problems with PAL-to-NTSC ""ghosting"" (like Milestone's transfer of South), and the existing audio-visual weaknesses seem to be inherent to the original 35-mm film stock itself.  And like I said, the inclusion of Eric Mival's documentary It Happened Here Again makes this DVD well worth looking at.  In fact, even though I doubt I'll return to Winstanley as much as I do to It Happened Here, I decided to buy this DVD as a show of support to Milestone, who keep making fascinating rarities like this available, and of course to Brownlow and Mollo.",1110585600,9,3166,5.196850393700787
