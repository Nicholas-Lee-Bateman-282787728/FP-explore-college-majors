7003622,4,B00TA9VS6C,"The release of ""Gone With The Pope"" makes sense from the standpoint of demand for satisfaction of curiosity.  Beyond that, what Grindhouse was able to cobble together from existing elements remains patchy and disjointed, making it a tough watch.  In particular, the heisting of the Pope, supposedly the centerpiece of the plot, is underwhelming, and demands the viewer to fill in a substantial number of gaps with assumption.  Bear in mind, this sentiment comes from someone who argues that ""The Naked Runner"" was Frank Sinatra's most underrated film.

One of the upsides of this movie is its naturalistic visual elements.  We get a slew of pleasantly dated location shots, particularly the obligatory Vegas montage circa 1976.  And the fashion.  Oh, the fashion.  The cover art gives you a hint as to what to expect in this domain.  Another plus that ""Gone With the Pope"" has is he charisma of its auteur, Duke Mitchell.  Easygoing, witty, at times blatantly racist and unconvincingly intimidating, Mitchell's personality makes viewers wish his canon was broader that just these two films.",1431734400,2,1090,5.142045454545454

7003624,5,B00TA9VS6C,"Probably my favorite release of the year. Major props to GR for their work in uncovering, cleaning up, and releasing this lost gem. If you like over-the-top exploitation films, crime/mafia flicks, or even just a unique voice from 70s cinema - you'll find it with Duke Mitchell. This is an absolute must-own.",1430092800,,307,4.923076923076923
7003625,5,B00TA9VS6C,"This is what cinema is meant to be like.. The only bad thing about Gone with the Pope is that is leaves you craving more and being that Duke Mitchell passed away shortly after making this film sucks because, other than this and Massacre-Mafia Style, thats all there is. He could've easily been the Martin Scorsese of low budget mob flicks.

Beautifully pieced together with all the care and love in the world by Grindhouse, Gone with the Pope is a testament to what is possible when one truly wants to create something that is original, funny and over the top and is relentless to get it done. I weep at the fact that I will never see another Duke Mitchell-directed film but I take comfort in the fact I can watch these two gems over and over again.

7003626,4,B00TA9VS6C,"Modern editing with old-school sentiments collide in this spiritual successor to the dreadful, but enjoyable, Massacre Mafia Style (MMS, amongst myself and my friends) which turns out to be both better and worse than the movie before it. What it lacks in creative kills that MMS had, it makes up for being a somewhat more cohesive story (as cohesive as a movie like this could be, anyway).

Hilariously vulgar racist quips, exploiting a fat person, criticizing the church, something about Jews and WWII, an ambiguous as Hell ending, and all the effort put in to polishing a turd; I found this equally enjoyable as MMS. If you liked  its predecessor, you're sure to like this, too.",1429574400,,680,4.853448275862069
7003627,3,B00TA9VS6C,"This was ok but a bit of a mess. Much of it does not make sense. A few scenes are pretty offensive. There is not much action, it's mainly dialog driven with some lingering shots of scenery. There are some fantastic shots of old Vegas in the beginning. The scenes with the old mafia guys sitting around are pretty cool. If your a die hard fan of 70s grindhouse check it out but it's not required viewing like Massacre Mafia Style.",1428710400,,429,4.308641975308642
7003628,5,B00TA9VS6C,"This movie could have only been made in the Seventies, and what a view of the Seventies it is!  Duke Mitchell's previous film Massacre Mafia Style, is another essential for fans of the period, but this one is I think far better.  The cinematography for one thing is better, and the plot is full of unexpected turns.  Things are definitely skewed to an Italian-American, Catholic outlook here, but Mitchell surprisingly takes us into several scenes where he criticizes the Catholic church, in more depth than he complained about the violent ways of the Italians in Massacre Mafia Style.  Of course this never stops him from being profane, violent, vulgar, and spouting off shockingly racist things along the way!  Be sure to watch one of the vast extras (mercifully short, too) that details a bit of the restoration of the movie.  This should be a wake-up call to purists about colorization and grain removal.  The restoration obviously makes this an incredibly beautiful piece of cinematic ... um, garbage.  Well, not garbage, but trashy.  The high class packaging and copious extras make this a collector's item.  My vote for number one grindhouse/exploitation release of the year!",1427414400,8,1182,5.046391752577319
8701085,4,B00TA9VS6C,"Gone With The Pope will make you feel dirty. It looks like it's filmed through a dirty bar glass that a hobo just spit in. The guys in the movie look legitimately like they've all seen a lot of prison time. The humor in the movie is cruel, racist, and never intentionally funny for the reasons they are hoping for. It's also bizarrely loopy with it's morality. Murder is ok. Blasphemy is encouraged. Killing 1000 priests makes up for millions dead in the Holocaust. Oh and towards the last 3rd of the film, you learn about the healing powers of the Catholic church and the grace of Jesus Christ, which I agree completely with this last bit about Jesus.

Despite all the above, the movie is bizarrely watchable and will stick with you as an utter mess. Apparently, even the crazy auteur of this film Duke Mitchell didn't even want to release it. Goodness knows what all he left on the floor. However, his wishes were not appeased after his death and much like Vladimir Nabokov's Original of Laura we got a nuclear mess on the hands of trash film lovers that's hard to ignore.  Yeah, it's disgusting, the sound is off, and the plot makes zero sense. The same time, it's oddly endearing and while they can't seem to make up their minds about whether you should be a decent person or not, They have a weird Hallmark Movie moment involving conversion to Christianity. It's a bit like your surly teen that in the end just wants attention. Your mileage will vary but I found it hilarious.",1497052800,,1481,4.522388059701493
8701086,4,B00TA9VS6C,"Schlocky, stupid, violent, incredibly entertaining, and has more replay value than clips on ""hornpub"". But i digress, Gone With the Pope is the epitome of gritty grindhouse cinema and belongs in your vast, gritty and depraved movie collection. This goes hand-in-hand with Duke Mitchell's other mob movie Massacre Mafia Style, so get 'em both.",1495756800,,342,5.351851851851852

8701088,4,B00TA9VS6C,I wanted to like it more but this movie would benefit from being viewed with a bunch of friends. Is somewhat the same with Duke Mitchell's previous movie but this one is more over the top.,1480550400,,188,4.25
8701089,5,B00TA9VS6C,"This film was not realese do until 2008 due to be shelved and unfinished. Thanks to grind house realsing it was finally unleashing and thank god it was. Yes it has a bit of continuity issues of course but that's due to the fact it was never finished. That being said it's a gem of film due to the fact it's a time capsule, the film footage of las vegas puts you right there in the 1970s. Time capsule films are worth every dime you spend on them. All I can do is praise them for making this happen!!! I could go for onto the story but hey just watch it and enjoy:)",1472947200,,564,4.0

8701092,5,B00TA9VS6C,"Recently released from Grindhouse Releasing is a dream for exploitation and crime film lovers over the world. Gone with the Pope is an unfinished film that took Oscar winning editor Bob Murawski (Spiderman) 15 years to complete. With missing film elements, no script and the director/writer/star deceased, it is amazing that this movie ever came to be. But God bless (no pun intended) the folks at Grindhouse Releasing for making this happen.

Gone with the Pope stars Duke Mitchell, a well known crooner who decided to try his hand at film making. He plays Paul, a gangster who was recently released from jail and is asked to do one last job before retiring. After the job is done, and before the mob (who hired him) can whack him, Paul gets a few of his ex con buddies to join him on a boat cruise to Italy to live it up with his recent wealth. He then unloads his plan to kidnap the Pope with a ransom of one dollar from every Catholic in the world (after realizing how many Catholics there are, he kindly lowers the ransom to fifty cents. What a guy!).

Gone with the Pope is a difficult film to describe. I guess I would call it an exploitation crime film with plenty of bloody violence, nudity and potty words. Mitchell's character is the text book definition of an anti-hero and you find yourself rooting for him throughout. The film itself almost feels like two films put together, pre-Pope and post-Pope. I actually thought I may have accidentally put on Mitchell's other film Massacre Mafia Style a half hour in because there was still no mention of the kidnapping. But once the group manage to snag him, I found myself laughing at the conversations the characters had with the Pope. I wouldn't call the dialogue inept though it was very absurd, but endearing too. I thought the film was so entertaining and Mitchell & Co. were so watchable and even likable that I can see myself re-watching it repeatedly. I actually can't think of the last film that was this entertaining (well at least not until I watched Massacre Mafia Style). But going beyond the film itself, Grindhouse Releasing's DVD/Blu Ray combo (like all of their other releases to date) is so jam packed with goodies that I almost felt overwhelmed. Not only is the packaging great (a booklet! yay!), but the extras are just so sprawling, well done and informative. For a long lost film that almost never was, the fact that so much care was given to its creation and release is astounding. I'd have to say that every Grindhouse Releasing release is essential for cult film fan, not only for film selections but also for presentation. Gone with the Pope is silly at times but so much fun that it I can't recommend it enough! See list of bonus features below:
