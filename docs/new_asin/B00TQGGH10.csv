7020382,4,B00TQGGH10,"Let Us Prey is a supernatural horror film about a malignant loners chilling effect on everyone he encounters during a night in jail. Rachel (Pollyanna McIntosh), a rookie cop, is about to begin her first night shift in a neglected police station in a backwater town. Surrounded by both disgruntled officers and irate petty offenders, she finds her job all the more difficult and terrifying when a mysterious man (Liam Cunningham, Game of Thrones) is brought in and strange, unexplained things start happening to everyone at the station. Rachel finds herself in a fight for her life against both cops and criminals as one by one they turn on each other. Now, she has to survive the night and uncover the strangers plans for the stations helpless victims before she too falls prey to a power that seeks to destroy them all.

Though the film relies on the tried-and-proven plot device of an outsider coming into a community and upsetting the status quo, Let Us Prey gives that plot device an interesting spin. With especially good cinematography, a location that drips with atmosphere, and a palpable sense of foreboding, the movie is unsettling, frequently frightening, and offset by some well-scripted moments of humor  not the kind that undermines the whole movie, but just enough humor to provide some breathing room between scarier scenes.

The film marks the directorial debut of Brian OMalley. Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette and theatrical trailer.",1432598400,10,1488,5.0653061224489795
7020383,5,B00TQGGH10,"The story unfolds through flashbacks and so does the character development. With every layer thats peeled back you learn more about the people and their stories and thats exactly were the tension comes from. At first you think these are the good guys and these are the bad, but with every flashback all your preconcieved notions are turned upside down. So until the end the story  has some surprises in store and  the ending  is really great. In my opinion one of the best horrorfilms (I must say that I do have a soft spot for religious themed scarflicks) in the last 10 years. A hell of a movie. The film is so good that you might excuse when Douglas Russell`s character Sgt. MacReady goes ""Event Horizon"" appearence-wise, because all the other stuff in the movie is quite genuine and original.",1430352000,4,796,4.631205673758865
7020384,5,B00TQGGH10,"The movie opens with a great soundtrack and visuals involving a man coming from the ocean accompanied by ominous ominous crows. Rachel Haggie (Pollyanna McIntosh) is a police constable on loan working the night shift. She wakes up from a bad dream of her past and a puzzling crow's feather under her pillow. The film had me hooked at this point. She goes to the station and people slowly get arrested. Our mysterious stranger shows up, a man of little words, but one ""who knows."" The creep factor heightens as strange things happen. He gives us a few lines that I liked. One was:

When he is told ""Go to hell."" He replies, Why? ""All the devils are here.""

The film mostly takes place in the police station. It is similar to""The Traveler"" with Val Kilmer. It is not hard to figure out the stranger. The fun is watching it unfold.

7020385,5,B00TQGGH10,"LET US PREY (2014) stars Pollyanna McIntosh (THE WOMAN) as PC Rachel Heggie. Her first night shift at her new post starts out w/ an arrest. Things seem to go smoothly, though Rachel notices that both the prisoners and her fellow cops are a surly, nasty, belligerent lot. Enter the stranger (Liam Cunningham- DOG SOLDIERS), a man who Rachel had witnessed, moments earlier, being hit dead center by a speeding car. Within minutes, the stranger's presence begins to change the atmosphere of the station, while the dark secrets of cops and prisoners alike are revealed. Who is this stranger? Why has he come? He arrived w/ no identification. No wallet. Nothing in his possession, save for a small notebook full of names. We realize very quickly that we're in for a wild, twisting, supernatural ride, resulting in hideous revelations and death. Rachel is in the midst of some terrible human beings. Of course, there's much more than just them to worry about! Rachel has secrets of her own, and will have to face them, along w/ her destiny.

7020417,1,B00TQGGH10,"This film starts out great, if you don't mind the rather blatant ripoff of John Carpenter.  But at first I took it more as an homage and enjoyed the Carpenter-esque pacing, and a score that sounds so close to classic Carpenter, that you'll wonder if Carpenter was involved himself.  The setting is also terrific, though the majority of the film is set within the confines of the jail block of a tiny Police station.

Sadly, that's about where my praise ends.  I enjoyed the majority of the film for the above reasons, until it was ultimately revealed that this was just another religious based horror by people who either have absolutely no concept of the religious beliefs they're writing about, or have absolutely no respect for said religion.  Still, you don't have to believe to be smart enough to figure out it's probably not the best idea to turn The Devil, you know THE source of all evil in the world into the good guy, in a horror film that is.  Hey, it might be fine for a comedy or a detective drama playing loosely with concepts of redemption.  But horror?  We're talking about an angel, who was cast down for it's abject hatred of mankind, the very bane of man's existence wanting nothing more than to cause us to damn ourselves. At that point it basically becomes a shallow parody of the horror genre.  Hardly horrific.  Not remotely scary at all.  I watched it alone, late at night, in a completely darkened large screen HT with full surround for the full effect, not streaming through a tablet or smartphone.

I suppose there's a slim chance that the writers and production talent did have a better understanding of the beliefs they're basing their story on, though after watching the making of, the likelihood seems extremely slim.  But maybe, just maybe there's some moral in the protagonists ultimate embrace of evil at the end of the last act.  Either way, it still wasn't scary.  It wasn't horror.  It was just a bad idea, or a mediocre idea with ultimately bad execution in direction and editing, mimicking classics of a genre that they really don't seem to get either.  ""Last Shift"" is a similar ""Prince of Darkness meets Precinct 13"" type film, but the thrills are much more potent and the parable more dramatically defined in that one.  The gore is more convincing too.",1474761600,,2294,4.664179104477612

7020419,2,B00TQGGH10,"Some good production as some reviewers have states already...  But the writing, ugh.  What a vomit piece.

Started off interesting, then became stupid and ridiculous; I only kept watching to see how asinine it could get.

There is one part in the movie that I did appreciate - at first - because I understand it on a religious level, where many others may not; when the mystery man speaks to the police captain (or chief?), the captain says ""so we're both Christians"" (I'm paraphrasing), the mystery man says something along the lines of ""except you're an Old Testament kind of man""; to people who study religion, that's a huge piece of dialogue, because it insinuates the captain believes in - and adheres to - the ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" way of thinking.  Kill people for any sort of sin, ""my way is the only way"", etc.

Unfortunately the captain's character becomes completely ridiculous and unbelievable later in the movie; it seems like demonizing anyone who believes in the Bible is the going thing in the movie industry.  But in my opinion, that's not what makes this movie so eye-rolling.

The very end dialogue pretty much sent it to it's death:

[SPOILER]

In the end sequence, the mystery man and our heroine are having a moment outside, and he remarks to her that all he wanted was their souls.  That they were wicked, etc.  This assumes he has the power to take them - which would mean this guy plays the role of ""God"" here.  He goes on to say ""the truth is, it's a cold place without you""; he's in love with our heroine.  The wicked souls are for her if she wants them, and all she has to do is say the word - she says yes - and says ""Heaven and Hell, for ever and ever"", and they kiss...  I assume she's playing the role of ""Satan""?

So what I gather from this part, is that they are in love, and are going to be together...?  Or something?

I don't mind off-the-wall stories, but it just ruins the movie when someone tries to be clever and twist historical figures into something that clearly doesn't make sense.

It would be like someone making a movie like this, except it was a portrayal of Ghandi and that he had an intimate relationship with Muhammad...  It's just really ridiculous.",1473206400,,2216,4.465174129353234

7020453,4,B00TQGGH10,"The 2014 film ""Let Us Prey"" is a classic folk legend updated for modern audiences. Its stylish inspirations are many, with more than a few nods to John Carpenter and Sam Raimi, but in this film demons walks the earth looking for souls to pay for their sins. This Irish-made thriller continues an impressive trend of recent horror excursions made in the country, to include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-Of-Xmoor/dp/B0102AKWAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast Of Xmoor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-the-Dark-Blu-ray/dp/B00S7L1FW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From the Dark [Blu-ray</a>], fun films aided by great on-location work.

What propels ""Let Us Prey"" is the incredible presence of Liam Cunningham, so good as Davos Seaworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones-Season-1-4-Box-Set-Blu-ray-Season-1-2-3-And-4-Blu-Ray-Box-Set/dp/B00DY64CR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones - Season 1-4 Box Set [Blu-ray] (Season 1 2 3 And 4 Blu-Ray Box Set)</a>. In this film he plays a mysterious stranger as ominous as Clint Eastwood in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Plains-Drifter/dp/0783225725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Plains Drifter</a>, slowly rising from the sea and strolling towards a small coastal town. Like Eastwood, Cunningham has little to say, but carries a leather-bound book with an endless list of hand-written names. He ends up in jail, and the small-town police are troubled by his lack of identity.

This is the debut of director Brian O'Malley, and he's done a nice job with atmosphere and a cast of talented actors. I also appreciated the work of Pollyanna McIntosh in the crucial role of rookie constable Rachel Heggie. She's a definite outsider at the police station, staffed by three additional officers with more than a few intimate secrets. She senses something wicked this way has come, but is never sure from which direction. McIntosh's Rachel had best watch her back as it appears the officers and jail inmates alike have dark sins so concentrated as to make a demon's appearance absolutely necessary.

I hate flashback sequences, especially when they are so vague as to be little more than a strobe light distraction. O'Malley uses that gimmick ad nauseam, even if the flashbacks are eventually explained. At times, you just want the film to get on with it. As the clock strikes midnight, madness emerges within the claustrophobic confines of the police station, with one character's breakdown so complete as to resemble something from the darkest of Clive Barker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Books-of-Blood-Vols-1-3/dp/0425165582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Books of Blood, Vols. 1-3</a>.

""Let Us Prey"" also contorts itself for increasingly graphic gore, even if most of the violence is perpetrated against those who arguably deserve it. And the conclusion should have been more powerful as Cunningham's character not only reveals himself, but an ulterior motive for his appearance in this darkest of hamlets. Still, when the Devil pulls the strings and a dance ensues, the world is cleansed by unexpected fires.

There's some talent here that needs to be reined in, but ""Let Us Prey"" is a fine horror film better than expected.",1451347200,,3440,6.389247311827957

Both films deal with a mysterious stranger who ends of in a prison in a small police station with few cops working & both strangers are there do take revenge/deal justice to the people in the building. That's where the similarities end though. The actor who played the stranger here did an ok job but I didn't like the rest of the cast, effects were good though to me it just felt like the movie dragged on for a bit in certain places while other things were never fully explained. It has some religious undertones as the stranger is basically there to make people pay for they've done in the past.

Liam Cunningham's nameless stranger is one of the most chilling yet strangely likeable characters I've seen from any genre in quite some time. The action is intense, the violence is daring, and the movie isn't afraid not to wrap up every little detail by the end but instead chooses to leave you with some thought provoking questions. People who enjoy films about evil people getting their comeuppance and strong female leads will absolutely adore ""Let Us Prey."" Solid and memorable acting, a great sense of atmosphere, a tight script, and just the right amount of mystery. This is a re-watch several times type of movie. See it, like right now.",1441756800,,909,5.026490066225166
7020484,3,B00TQGGH10,"I rented this one form The Box as I am doing more often now when I'm not sure if the movie would be worth the Amazon price. I hate getting burned with paying to watch bad movies even if its only for a few bucks.
I wish I could remember the US movie that seems to have a simular storyline that takes place in a police station I believe from the 80's or 90's.
The story takes place for the most part in a police station that revolves around 4 cops and 3 arrested locals plus a accident victim 6 (Liam Cunningham) who is a demon or satan or maybe an angel. Six is there to rid the place of bad people. This takes place on rookie PC. Rachel Heggie's (Pollyanna McIntosh) first night at her new assigned station.
The story is evenly paced with good direction and acting, but for me this story didn't bring anything new to the table nor was the story different enough to separate it from other movies with similar plots. We are left with trying to figure out many of the unanswered questions of why was Rachel placed in this hole in the wall police station or why was 6 sent to the same police station and what made these people be singled out for their punishments. Yes, I know they all did very bad things, but the world is filled with even more horrific acts against humanity. The director shot the entire movie with minimal lighting to add a sense of dread or impending doom that was somewhat effective. The movie was shot in Ireland and some of the characters were hard for me to understand like Sgt. MacReady (Douglas Russell) and to a lesser degree Caesar (Brian Vernel). So if you have a hard time understanding some of the heavy/thick accents from the UK, Ireland, Scotland or Wales actors then you might want to take a pass on this one. It is by no means a bad horror movie with heavy/thick accents and dimly lit scenes and a good amount of blood, gore and violence, but rather well produced (thats saying a lot these days) average story horror (that saying a lot too!) with good acting and effects.",1441756800,,2003,4.329787234042553

Pros: The main actress Pollyanna Mcintosh was amazing, she reminded me of Milia Jovovich (Resident Evil) she is pretty and she kicked azz in this move. The movie scenery was creepy and very odd and gave me the creeps the entire way through. The accents were throwing me of a little but that only made me pay even closer attention to the dialogue.

The cons: Way too bloody and gory for me. Everyone is CRAZY and the action/killing was over the top. The ending was a little confusing, this movie had so many violent scenes reminded me of 30 days of night. Still a good movie, great to watch late at night.

7020525,4,B00TQGGH10,"Moralistic horror films, films preoccupied with sin, tend toward the claustrophobic, and also tend to be filled with people engaging in or confessing to behaviors that are so clearly contrived that by the end the viewer has cramps in the muscles responsible for eye rolling. The typical scenario is that you have a room full of people who have just woken up, are trapped in a room together, and have no idea how they got there. Pretty soon they're all arguing and casting aspersions at each other in expository sentences that nobody but novice screenwriters ever come up with, and then awful things start happening, the people start doing terrible things to each other, and at the end the audience is supposed to be bowled over by how sinful we really are.

I was rolling my eyes through a lot of this movie, mostly because of the writing. Oh, it's very clever; the characters are always picking at each other with caustic one-liners that seem well thought out, and while that does tend to keep things interesting, that's just not really the way life is: some people are very good at delivering caustic one liners and other people aren't, and that makes sense because in real life everyone writes their own dialogue. Add to that the very dubious depiction of small town police work (in the opening of the movie, a cop who is on her very first day of work in a new location wakes up, puts on her uniform in her own bedroom, goes out and makes an arrest, and only then does she make her first visit to the station to meet her new supervisor for the first time. Huh?), plus the presence of lots of lines that come straight from the Magic Sack of Obvious Clichs (does anyone in real life ever refer to himself as a ""man of science""?) and it's pretty clear that this movie is best enjoyed with a mighty fine helping of disbelief suspension.

And yet, come on, it's a horror movie. Even if it takes itself too seriously, that doesn't mean we have to, and it delivers on so many things that horror movies are supposed to deliver: blood, gore, intensity, darkness. Pollyanna McIntosh of The Woman is awesome in all her Amazonian furor, and visually the movie is a huge success, with bold use of color, brutal imagery, and a plot that never gets bogged down. Plus, even though the movie doesn't take place in especially believable world, at least it does take place in a world, rather than a trapped elevator or a locked room where people are waking up and saying, ""How did I get here?""

If I could, I'd probably give this movie 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because the ending was so satisfying that I came away feeling like I got a lot more than what most movies of this stripe could give me, and I know that there are people out there who enjoy this sub-genre of horror a lot more than I do, and they're likely to spend a lot less time quibbling with it and a lot more time enjoying it as what it is, one of the better examples of its category.",1435190400,6,2936,4.423290203327172

7020528,3,B00TQGGH10,"Rachel is having a bad day. For reasons unknown, she has been transformed to the tutelage of a small town cop in an unusually sleepy town, and on her way to the station, she witnesses a young driver slam into a man who immediately disappears from the scene (as opposed to writhing on the ground in agony, as most of us would). It's the beginning of a dark descent into depravity for Rachel and everyone else who enters the police station, for the man who was hit by the car isn't a victim at all. Quite frankly, he is an enigma, and his ""job"" is to repay the wicked for their sins.

The folks in this small town have committed some horrific sins, but the movie isn't particularly horrifying or scary. And it feels a bit contrived that all those evil bubbles out of one police station (with three officers) and a handful of citizens. Not to mention, the power that the man wields is unclear. He seems to have some sort of physic ability, but nothing is explained beyond that.

In the end, it's a solid effort - a drama fueled with some suspense, although some gore bubbles to the surface from time to time. And by the end, you will undoubtedly agree that the prey should have prayed.",1434931200,2,1182,4.368181818181818

As the night progresses, weird things start happening and they soon suspect the mysterious man that was involved in a hit and run. The storyline is far from original, but I thought the ending was unexpected. You don't really care if the characters live or die after some flashback scenes showing you exactly who they are. It's not a who-dun-it type of movie because we know right off the bat there's a direct connection between the events of the night and the mysterious man.
