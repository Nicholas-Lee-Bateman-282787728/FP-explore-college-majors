4599636,5,B0058KGHXQ,Great movie. I wish this would have been around when I did thruhike of the Appalachian Trail. The take home message of bringing the kindness of the trail back home to society is a great piece of advice. The footage along the Pacific Crest Trail is pretty amazing as well.,1314230400,6,271,4.44

4599641,5,B0058KGHXQ,"Without doubt ""Six Million Steps: A Journey Inward"" is the best of the hiking movies available today.  If you can only watch one, watch this one.  Having seen many (possibly all) myself, i can say this movie is well done, informative, and enjoyable throughout.  I never hiked a long trail like the PCT but I have hiked a few great trails in North and South America.  Now I mostly watch movies.  Get out there while you can.  Happy trails to you.",1471564800,9,445,4.432098765432099
4599642,5,B0058KGHXQ,"I have watched many hiking documentaries, most times I find the dull and unenterprising. That being said I loved this one. When I put it in I watched the whole thing in one sitting. The only problem with this CD is it should come with a warning label. ""Danger watching this may cause you to leave your job and family for six months and go hike the PCT""  This is a great view, buy it and enjoy it.",1445558400,8,396,4.076923076923077
4599643,5,B0058KGHXQ,"I'm a section hiker - rarely get more than three to five weeks at a time to get out on the trail, so it took almost ten years to finish the Pacific Crest Trail. The disadvantage of that is that every year you have to recondition your body for the hardship of the trail. The wonderful plus is that you meet almost a completely new set of hikers every year, Either the PCT brings out the best in people, or it is a select few special people who do it. In any case, Six Million Steps showcases those people. It is not so much a story of the trail as it is a glimpse of of the people - something well worth watching.",1440633600,9,612,3.983739837398374
4599644,5,B0058KGHXQ,"I finally got my DVD and just finished watching it. I LOVED it!!!! So raw and real and exactly what I was hoping for!! My plan is to hike it next year and I wanted to hear the ""real"" good, bad and the ugly of the reality of hiking this untamed beast. It's a beast I want to challenge and hopefully conquer. Thank you for putting this awesome Doc together. Well done!! I highly recommend purchasing  this excellent documentary not only if you plan on hiking the PCT but also for the fact that it's an awesome movie!!",1440547200,12,515,4.255102040816326
4599645,5,B0058KGHXQ,Excellent movie!! I've done 2 section hikes on the PCT and this movie really tells it like it is out there. I just got home a few weeks ago and watching this movie made me want to get back out there!,1440288000,,199,3.8780487804878048
4599646,5,B0058KGHXQ,"I really enjoyed this movie, I did not know the trail existed. A place to escape our regular day to day life and explore nature at it's best.",1436832000,,141,4.071428571428571
4599647,5,B0058KGHXQ,"Wow! Such and inspiration! After watching this movie, I'm ready to quit my job and hit the trail!",1436832000,,97,4.444444444444445
4599648,5,B0058KGHXQ,"This is an unbelievably inspirational documentary, granting an insight on the Pacific Crest Trail and the hiking community. Prior to viewing this film, I had been an avid 'weekend warrior,' but had never heard about the PCT.

What I enjoyed most about this film, as compared to ""Wild,"" was the depth to which ""Six Million Steps"" explored the daily life, hardships, and rewards all of the hikers experienced. What's more, is how well the film explores the little-known hiker culture, including aspects such as trail angles, trail names, and life-long friendships.

Hikers make this journey for an array of reasons. This film unearths why so many people, from so many different walks of life seek one ultimate goal.",1436400000,7,713,5.033898305084746
4599649,5,B0058KGHXQ,loved it very emotional and inspiring! ill be doing the pct soon i hope worth watching if you love backpackong/hiking!,1394928000,2,118,4.95
8461709,3,B0058KGHXQ,Would have liked to see more of the wildlife. In my opinion it foccased to mush on people.,1528675200,,90,4.055555555555555
8461710,5,B0058KGHXQ,Thought provoking journey up the Pacific coastal trail that took 5 months to complete. It changed how they view life and physically challenged them. Do you think you can do this?,1528502400,,178,4.774193548387097
8461711,3,B0058KGHXQ,"This is a good documentary about thru-hikers on the PCT. It took a bit to get over the campy-ness of the production. There's also a really weird religious segment in the middle that almost caused us to turn it off. I understand that hiking for 5 months straight would be a very spiritual experience (whatever that means to you) but only one view was represented in the film. Of course, it was the western god. If more diverse viewpoints had been shown, it wouldn't have felt so one-sided and as though someone was trying to push their agenda.",1526860800,,542,4.540816326530612
8461712,4,B0058KGHXQ,"Have watched twice now. Really enjoyed it. It isn't perfect... The bible thumping for 20 minutes at about 2/3 in is annoying in particular. 2018 and we still act like frightened villagers needing belief in a mysterious space creature that ""created"" everything. Whatever. Aside from that and not the greatest coverage of trail info (almost entirely philosophical discussion, VERY little about gear, not much more about the trail) it is the best such video I have seen. A LOT BETTER than YouTube which centers on gear weight and how awesome the hikers think they are for how fast they can go.",1525651200,,590,4.851485148514851
8461713,2,B0058KGHXQ,Way too much bloody talking from people who are not that compelling.  Shut up and hike.,1524441600,,87,4.4375
8461714,5,B0058KGHXQ,"One of the better hiking movies I've watched. Real and honest, nicely shot.",1524268800,,75,4.846153846153846
8461715,5,B0058KGHXQ,"Wasn't what I had expected, but a wonderful peek at something monumental. Really hard to give a 'feel' for what something so massive as hiking the PCT is. Would have liked more women - I am one - to contribute. Seemed mostly a male point of view, with a few females added. But, all in all, I really liked it. What made this one different was the fact they didn't project their own most profound perspective, rather, a good snapshot (which is all one can do in the brief time of the movie) of PCT. I want to go!",1524268800,,510,4.161616161616162
8461716,5,B0058KGHXQ,Very good.  A cross section of all the varied diverse folk who make the journey was enriching to hear their stories.,1523664000,,116,4.523809523809524
8461717,5,B0058KGHXQ,I loved it! Really inspiring. I'm looking forward to my next adventure.,1518652800,,71,5.0
8461718,1,B0058KGHXQ,"I expected this  DVD to record a persons hike along the PCH.  I was anxious to see the scenery and the views from the trail.  Instead I got a video of hikers recording their thoughts as they traveled along.  There was no scenery, no views and nothing about the sites.  I wasted my money.",1487635200,13,287,4.2407407407407405
