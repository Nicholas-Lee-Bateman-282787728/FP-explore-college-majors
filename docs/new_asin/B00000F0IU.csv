When I was a child the British movie Kiplings Jungle Book was magical to me, and I listened to the old 78rpm record album countless times.  Now when I tried to record those old scratchy 78s for a new baby to listen to, I found that they were hard to hear, and applied to Amazon in the hope I could get a clearer version, I learn that today Jungle Book is Disney.  You Disney cartoonists: don't you understand your arrogance in imagining you can come up with a cartoon character that will equal Sabu?  Have you even heard of Sabu? May I suggest to you that you might consider leaving Disney and seeking honest employment?",1030233600,,719,4.383458646616542
