1487775,5,B00005JMSD,"This show needs to be on DVD!  I was disappointed when it ended.  I was able to see it in syndication for a while but then it was canceled from syndication.  I would not think twice about spending my hard earned money on purchasing the entire series of China Beach. I never get tired of seeing the eyes of the Vietnam war through the doctors and nurses.  The laughs, the tears, the heartache and the sorrow.  Some of my favorite actors/actresses came from this show.
I think everyone should have a chance to see it again and again and again.",1076284800,13,541,4.37
1487776,5,B00005JMSD,"China Beach well deserves to be released as are so many lesser series on DVD by the season or a Box set including all the episodes. It was a shame it didn't run longer at the time and I don't know what killed it. I remember it had good ratings and a good fan following. China Beach was a wonderful drama that ran from 1988 through 1991. It was about an American base hospital in Vietnam located near China Beach. The beach itself was used for recreation by recooperating wounded soldiers and those on leave from combat. The beach itself offered a stark contrast to the pain and suffering in the hospital on base. It also offered some nice backgrounds for romantic scenes for the nurses and a chance to get some of them occasionally into shorts or bathing suits. However do not think it was some mindless beach movie!  This series was a drama that showed the the lives and efforts of doctors and nurses working in a hospital in Vietnam. Unlike Mash that came before it, this was serious drama about the wounded soldiers coming through the hospital and the doctors, but mostly the nurses that took care of the wounded and sometimes dying. With some soldiers horribly wounded and suddenly dealing with the loss of limbs, eyes, and other life changing injuries there is plenty of drama to keep you interested. Also some of the nurses of course end up dating soldiers in the field. Like the real Vietnam the cast had many actresses and actors killed or returned to USA and some new cast members joined just in it's three seasons. The show itself was a showcase for the talents particularly of Dana Delaney playing Colleen McMurphy one of the nurses. She was outstanding and my favorite. She later on went on to do some Movies such as Wyatt Earp's love affair in the movie Tombstone, and a sexy role in Exit to Eden a good comedy. She also was in Fly Away Home, Moon Over Paradore (comedy), and House sitter. She is one of those women who is beautiful and exciting yet at the same time not so stunning that she doesn't seem real or obtainable. She is an earthy redhead you could easily meet and hope to marry. Yet this woman has an undercurrent of sexiness as seen more in a couple of her Movies that men only dream of. I guess it boils down to a real person not so out of reach, but yet facinating.
  The other star of this piece was Robert Picardo who went on to have a long stretch as the holographic doctor in Start Trek's Voyager series and on some Star trek Movies as well. lesser known but great in the series were Nan Woods as Cherry White, Chloe Webb as Laurette Barber and a slew of others. It was very well done show with a cast of attractive yet real looking people. It tied in well with the TV series run of Tour of Duty another series on Vietnam soldiers.",1074211200,362,2763,4.382066276803119

1488041,5,B00005JMSD,"I have had PTSD since the 1970's.  Since I have watched the box, twice, most of the symptoms have disappeared!  For the first time in years I can actually look at the pictures I took. I would like to thank Dana Delany and the crew of actors and technical support personnel for the fine work they did in putting together such a fine program for TV. The program is so realistic that I have recommended it to the Veterans Administration as a possible aid to treat PTSD!  The short bumps of missing action didn't bother me because of the sophisticated way they were handled in the plot.

The show is not only for oldies like me!  China Beach was ahead of its time. Women especially will find there roles most interesting! Men will also find the show, about war, most interesting. Very often the value of rear areas are not understood in the planning of military campaigns! Military schools would do well to consider use of some of the shows when teaching strategy and tactics, today!

Finally younger people today would do well to watch some of the episodes to understand what altruism means!",1501545600,2,1088,4.582474226804123

The Vietman War, err, sorry, POLICE ACTION!  Please do not insult my intelligence by making it seem as if we were simply halfway around the world arresting people.  In My Humble, bombs, and tanks, and, what do they call those things, oh, I remember guns, appear to be weapons of war.

So I'm thinking it was a war, even though it was never ""officially"" designated a war.  Betcha all those people who died in the ""police action"" died in an offical way aka they died from being shot, being blown up, or blown to bits.  So, yes it was a war, but the show was great.

Long out of distribution for legal reasons arising from the licensing of the 267 songs used in the 62 episodes, this series is still more than pertinent for both it's truths regarding the impact of the Vietnam War on it's casualties and survivors and for the light it sheds on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) long before the term was coined and the dark truths behind this pernicious disease became front page headlines. A superb cast, many who have gone on to fame and fortune in other TV series and movies, excellent writing with the dark humour of Catch 22 combined with a lighter touch from MASH (movie and TV) and stylistic touches the presage shows like ER (which is unsurprising given John Wells critical involvement in both projects).

1489262,4,B00005JMSD,"One of the most under-appreciated television programs ever aired, China Beach lasted four seasons on ABC from 1988-1991. The show and its cast received nominations for several awards and won quite a few, but failed to receive the viewer support it deserved. Never before has the series been released on DVD or VHS, due in part to the difficulty in securing proper licenses for the musical content of the show. In 2013, StarVista Entertainment was finally able to release the entire series with all the original music.

The show is comparable to the 1970s dramedy M*A*S*H, seeing war through the eyes of medical staff and other personnel. China Beach is set in  Nng, Vietnam, and follows the work of Colleen McMurphy (Dana Delany), K.C. Koloski (Marg Helgenberger), Dick Richard (Robert Picardo), Boonie Lanier (Brian Wimmer) and more. The episodes are well written and creators William Broyles, Jr. and John Sacret Young deserve a lot of credit for bringing the era to life.

China Beach  The Complete Series includes over ten hours of bonus features, including a special 25th anniversary cast reunion. A small booklet, Tales from the Five & Dime, showcases the producers character notes and reflections on specific scenes and memorable moments. A handful of fan letters are reproduced in the booklet as well. Fans of the show will love China Beach  The Complete Series, and it would be a perfect gift for those who remember how much they loved it when it first aired.",1389657600,,1468,4.951219512195122

Be WARY of imitations. It can be bought for $45 from chinabeachdvd.com, but that is a fraud site. It is either selling very poor quality screen grabs, or just taking your money. For a while NYTimes had a link to this site erroneously, and Dana Delany even tweeted about it (it fooled her too). Since then NYTimes has corrected their site.

I'll post a further review once I've received my copy!",1386460800,5,662,4.554621848739496
1489268,5,B00005JMSD,"I am so grateful the legal wrangling over copyrights that prevented this collection from China Beach fans has been resolved. Finally we can watch our beloved characters live their turbulent years again. More importantly, again we can come to understand what the men and women of the Vietnam War suffered in The Nam and carried with them back to The World.

What was learned from that war and the people who lived it has made major changes in medical treatment, mental services and how service people are reintegrated into peace-time society. There have been great improvements, but as we see what veterans of the Afghan and Iraq wars still suffer, it is obvious still more must be done.

Back in the day, I was about the age of the characters in the series. Having missed watching the show in the Eighties, a benighted time when you couldn't watch one channel and tape another, I came to love China Beach the summer of 2000, when it was rebroadcast on TV Land. I was amazed how much I had missed in the Sixties. And not for the reasons you are thinking! I was clean and sober!

I started to realize how much politics and history had passed me by as I lived my life back in The World while men and women lived and died a war in The Nam. For me. Vietnam was  a war I tried to follow, but couldn't grasp. None of us really did, just as the Middle East wars have confused and frustrated us once again.  The complexities of Vietnam went right over my head as I fell for the buzz words: domino theory, pacification, search and destroy.  Granted, China Beach and it's network rival, Tour of Duty, also rebroadcast that summer of 2000, opened up lost memories, made concepts finally click. I began to relive that part of my life with clearer understanding.

As a result, I started to write. My writings became two books about a young man my age, from my town, who willingly went to Vietnam to fight and came home with issues that he still struggles to resolve. I since have met and spoken to Vietnam vets who live at least some of each day in parallel worlds, trying to be in the present while that old past continues to dig at their innermost peace.

China Beach is only a TV show. But it tackled important events and issues that even now have meaning and resonance. Watch it for the pleasure of the stories. Take away from it a deeper meaning that will enrich your life experience.",1385337600,3,2375,4.44367816091954
1489269,5,B00005JMSD,As pointed out by others Amazon sellers are overcharging $100+ but that doesn't detract from the worthiness of this triple A plus series. In fact Amazon and Netflix would be doing a great service by obtaining the rights to stream it. This show should not be appreciated only by those of us who remember viewing it  decades ago; like the A&E production of Tenko which the BBC also ran (it seems to have been more appreciated over there)  younger eyes should be offered the chance to see stellar acting and excellent writing and scoring. Just getting rights to so much music must have taken major red tape so kudos to not dubbing in elevator music like Northern Exposure.,1383782400,,669,4.661016949152542
1489336,4,B00005JMSD,"China Beach was a Critically acclaimed series that ran from April 1988 to July 1991. Finally after a 25 years wait and hundreds of requests from fans, it's available on DVD in 2013!

China Beach was one of my most favorite shows back in the day. It has been so long that I didn't realize that Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, was the same actress as the very Hot Redhead, Karen Charlene ""K.C."" Koloski, a heroin-addicted prostitute and later black-marketeer that I had a crush on as a teen. Also didn't realize that Dana Delany who played Katherine Mayfair on the Desperate Housewives and played Megan Hunt on the ABC drama series Body of Proof was the same actress as China Beach's Nurse Colleen McMurphy. They both looked different with red hair in China Beach (Nowadays Blond). Also surprised to see Robert Picardo,  the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), ""The Doctor"", on Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and some Star Trek movies and played Richard Woolsey in the Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe was the same actor as Dr. Dick Richards on China Beach (who had hair back than).

Only 2 complaints, as someone mentioned earlier, is the Price, $200- $325 for Seasons 1-4, which is totally not worth it for only 62 episodes with No Sub-Titles nor Closed-Captions which my wife needs (she's not deaf) just unable to comprehend actors talking in an accent whether it's a Texas, Southern, Mid-Western, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Boston, Scottish, Cockney, Irish, Aussie, Hispanic, Hip-Hop/Ghetto Talk, Cajun nor French-Canadian. She really needs English Subs (so do I sometimes) which especially should be available since we're paying up the yin-yang on these DVD sets.

I ended up paying over $100 more for it than if I had bought it from the distributor, Time Life. Really sad that Amazon chose to support the HUGE mark-up.

The range levels are extremely uneven, causing you to leap for the remote as a scene changes and the volume goes sky-high. The differences between levels for music and dialogue are such that if you want to hear the dialogue, your eardrums will be obliterated by either the music or foleys in the next moment.

1489530,5,B00005JMSD,"To start off, this would not be a show on network TV today.  The confines of television have loosened up a bit in the past 15 years and to have a show on a network is  to have your show neutered.  ""China Beach"" may have survived for more than 62 episodes had it been on a network like HBO or AMC today.  But then again, those 62 episodes span the years from 1966 to 1988 and bring the entire story full circle.

Having not really seen this show in over twenty years, I approached this release with a lot of happiness and just a *little* trepidation. Would it hold up?  Would it seem horribly dated?  Would it seem hokey?  And when it arrived, I tore it open and started watching.

Season One could have been a self-contained miniseries as it has a beginning, a middle and an end.  The pilot is well done but seems a little unsure of itself as do the first few episodes.  While the Vietnam war was often a backdrop for the show rather than being front and center, the USO plotlines, one character's search for a missing family member and the character's love lives often take center stage.  It's an uneven season that finds it's footing about four episodes in.  And from there we go onto Season Two which redefines the characters( Lila suddenly becomes a Major even though if you watch carefully in Season One, there is never any indication that she is military), disposes of characters, brings new blood in and takes the bold step of killing off one of the major players.  It was at this point a lot of people started saying the show was ""too depressing"" but I loved it.  And then we got to Season Four which changed all the rules and showed us the ""ever after"" which, for too many, wasn't ""happily.""

I am glad we finally have a chance to see the show again.  I love having the entire set so we don't have to wait forever for another season which may not show up due to ""poor sales"" (ahem, ""Knots Landing."")  It's wonderful to finally have the chance to see the show again, with its music and its happiness and horror. China Beach forever.",1367452800,7,2040,4.351851851851852

The bonus items come packaged in their own box, separate from the dvds. The 5 photos are high quality and printed on real photo paper and the 3 scripts are nicely printed. So far I have watched 3 episodes and have only noticed one or possibly two changes from the original episodes. In the second episode, when Cowboy, Boonie, and Sweetness have a grenade thrown at them, I think the song may be different from the original ep. In the third episode, the scene of Laurette performing at the 40's show for the General, that scene is completely cut out. I'm not sure why they would cut the complete scene other than maybe some music issue.

If amazon doesn't want its members to share knowledge of the links that companies like time life pay them for perhaps it time to take my prime membership elsewhere.

And the final season, showing us the long-term effects of that war? Stunningly accurate. Many of my relatives (my mother included) couldn't bear to watch all the way through an episode.

1489597,5,B00005JMSD,"TV on DVD.com has announced that Time-Life will be releasing ""China Beach : The Complete Series"" in 2013:

FAIRFAX, VA, December 14, 2012 - Following in the footsteps of critically acclaimed and best-selling deluxe DVD sets of THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW, THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and many others, the TV DVD archivists at Time Life, in conjunction with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group, will release the beloved ABC-TV series CHINA BEACH in 2013. One of the most eagerly-anticipated unreleased television programs of all time, according to TVShowsOnDVD.com, the release marks the first time the complete series will be available on any format. CHINA BEACH: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION will be offered as a singular collector's set featuring all 62 episodes (64 hours), and several hours of specially-created bonus features including a cast reunion and interviews with Dana Delany, Marg Helgenberger, producers John Sacret Young and John Wells, and many other cast and crew members. CHINA BEACH: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION will initially be available exclusively online, available for pre-order at [...] in early 2013, before it rolls out nationally to retail later in the year.

From the moment CHINA BEACH debuted in 1988 with its iconic opening credits backed by the Supremes' ""Reflections,"" it was hailed as groundbreaking. In an era of testosterone-driven Vietnam movies such as Platoon, CHINA BEACH - created by award-winning journalist and Vietnam vet William Broyles Jr. and John Sacret Young - delivered the war from a unique perspective: that of the women, military personnel and civilians who were present during the conflict. Set in the Vietnam locale of China Beach, at the ""Five and Dime"" (a.k.a. the 510th Evacuation Hospital and R&R), the cast was made up of US Army doctors and nurses, officers and soldiers, Red Cross volunteers and civilian personnel, either on leave or at the end of their tour of duty. The supremely talented ensemble cast featured many actors beginning to make their marks on the industry, and included Dana Delany (First Lieutenant/Captain Nurse Colleen McMurphy), Marg Helgenberger (K.C. Koloski), Michael Boatman (SP4 Sam Beckett), Robert Picardo (Captain Dr. Dick Richard) and Ricki Lake (Holly Pelegrino). The other side of the camera boasted such accomplished talents as multiple Emmy Award-nominee Writer/Director/Executive Producer Sacret Young and producer John Wells, who would go on to executive produce ""ER"" and ""The West Wing.""

One of the hallmarks of the series was the use of music -- iconic, emotional music from the era featuring everyone from Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, to Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder. It's the music, in fact, that has prevented CHINA BEACH from being released at all. Time Life spent over a year painstakingly clearing the rights to nearly 500 musical copyrights, so the program will be released with almost all of the original music intact.",1355443200,16,2916,5.280172413793103

Update: ""China Beach: The Complete Series"" will be released in 2013 by Time Life.

The set will feature all 64 episodes of the 1988-91 show, as well as hours of bonus material, including a cast reunion and interviews with stars Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger and producer John Wells.

The music issue: The show, which unfolded the story of the Vietnam War from the perspective of female military personnel and civilians, featured lots of '60s tunes (including Diana Ross & the Supremes' ""Reflections"" as the series theme) throughout its four-season run. Time Life spent more than a year getting clearances for nearly 500 songs for the DVD release.

As a teenager, I watched this show religiously when it aired on TV in the late 1980s. For me, one of the most profound episodes is the dinner party, when Cherry speaks her mind to the higher-ups, and McMurphy finds herself locked in a suite with a detoxing K.C.

It is an absolute mystery why this isn't available on DVD yet. It needs to come out soon because my VHS recordings are worn through! Unlike a previous reviewer, I do think I know what helped end the show. If I remember correctly, it started to become more about the intimate romantic relationships between the characters than about their intimate relationships with the war around them.

I will not go into the reasons for its greatness (172 other reviewers have all given it 5 stars).  I watched, and fortunately videotaped it, when it was originally on, so at least I have that.  I was of the right age and just missed (through some remarkable circumstances) being drafted and possibly sent to Viet Nam.  I later became a physician and joined the Air Force, so for several reasons this show appealed to me and was relevant to me.  However, every year the group that can relate to, and truly enjoy, this show gets smaller.  Why bring it out now if there wasn't sufficient reason 5 or 10 years ago?  I hope I am wrong but I don't expect this to ever come out as a DVD collection.

I have been waiting for China Beach to come out on DVD, but much like the hold up with the release of Miami Vice, it is due to the music rights.  So much music was used on the show, Warner Bros.  is obviously having trouble figuring out licensing and royalties on it.  It is a wonder they have not realized that putting that show in syndication and all of the pent up demand out there for it will bring in a few bucks.

Are you kidding me I can name all kinds of movies that have been released that have played the same music and there wasn't a problem.  China Beach was one of the best political series about the Viet Nam war.  It was the closest to the truth and was very personal in letting you experience each character's position-nurse, doctor, front line soldiers, etc...

I think this generation needs to see this series, and see all the loss of potential that went with the young soliders that were killed.  I think we need to put pressure on the powers that be to release this DVD and stop making excuses.

1489712,5,B00005JMSD,"This show meant so much to me when it first ran in the 80s.  I could kill myself for not having recorded it on VHS when it was being repeated on Lifetime (I think it was Lifetime) in the early 90s.  All I have is a scratchy VHS recording of the last episode.

In my humble opinion, this was one of the best series of all time.  The writing and acting were superior, particularly that of Dana Delaney and Marg Helgenberger.  I almost hate to see them on the other series they're on/have been on because they don't compare to the quality of China Beach.  Additionally, many other members of the excellent cast have been relegated to bit parts that are so below their level of talent.

It really angers me that whoever owns the rights to this gem of a show can't work out the whole music rights thing (if that is indeed the issue) so those of us for whom this series meant so much can't own it.  I keep seeing blogs and other posts that say the series was forgotten, but I think that's wrong.  Many of us fans are still out here and waiting with baited breath for the greedy SOBs who own the rights to the music to work with the the owner of the series (if they are different) to work this out.  If this series could be streamed or made available on DVD and offered on Netflix, Hulu and the many other on-line/direct providers and properly marketed, a whole new generation of viewers would grow to love and value this series as much as those of us who were fortunate enough to view and cherish it when it originally aired.  Think of the many people coming home from Iraq and Afganistan who, if given exposure to this show, could relate to it.

I know the people who are battling over the rights related to this show don't see our comments here and in the many other forums I've been on.  Does anyone know if there's somewhere we could write directly to plead our cause and get some direct answers?  There is power in numbers and I do believe we can make a difference.

In the meantime, I guess we wait for the fights to end so we can eventually own this show which meant so much to so many.",1322870400,,2087,4.234848484848484

1489808,5,B00005JMSD,"I have worked the swing shift forever so have missed all of the various series on tv,including China Beach.  It has also taken me a while to ""forgive"" that war, separate the men from the politicians/generals making that war, etc.  I am of an age to have contemporaries who fought in VN--who never wanted to talk about it to anyone who didn't go.  I have done a bit of reading first-hand accounts of both the soldiers doing the actual fighting and witnessing, and the women who volunteered to go (nurses, USO, radio jocks, etc.).  Since there seems to be some sort of copyright/legal problem holding up the release of these DVDs, I decided to take a chance with DVDs made in China (sic) which claimed to be playable on US players.  They did, except about half of them were damaged and stopped playing, and at least one was a duplicate (so I'm not sure paying $100 for $50 worth is worth is?).  I found that many of the stories were translated from the varous VN accounts I'd read, making the tv shows more authentic.  Including the after-being-there struggles many vets have gone through.  It was interesting to see how at the beginning when the US first got involved, the soldiers going over were all ""America right or wrong, mom apple pie"" but as the war progressed and got dirtier (can't tell your allies from your enemies), the attitude of the soldiers also changed, as well as the drug use.  So many of the stories were true--including the discussion between the black soldiers about how they were being sent out to die more frequently then any others (which was true), the drinking and bedding that went on, the fatalism.  I hope that someday all the legal stuff gets straightened out because this is an important series the younger generations need to see and now about.  (And as shallow as it may seem, I still think there was some good music back then, also reflective of the feelings about that war.)  And, it is good to know that Dana Delany has a new series that just started this past month (it's about time someone scooped up that actress)--I hear it's good but haven't figured out when it's on and which channel (and I'm still working swing so probably won't catch it).",1301616000,3,2183,4.583547557840617
1489867,5,B00005JMSD,"Yes, I serviced a portable generator that we Sea Bees maintained at the China Beach Hospital as back up power. Our base of operations was not far away, in the Navy Public Works Department. This TV series was surreal, but with enough reality that it brought many, many memories as I watched. I fell in love with the character Delany represented, if not Delany, herself. She reminds me so much of the wife I had waiting back home, both in looks and personality. Quiet, attractive, demurring, and sexy as all get-out! Thank you, Dana! XOXO!

'Nam was pure hell for me, some ways, but in others so eye-opening to global relationships all humans face every day. It was bot a war, and a peace experience for me, and China Beach contains about the same mix of both as I experienced. I met, and worked with good-hearted civilians, and evil-minded citizens of South Vietnam. I had a fellow Sea Bee who came to work one night bragging he had shot up a sampan from under a Vietnamese woman polling across the DaNang River, and I saw my country citizens give their meager salaries to help distraught and stranded orphans and villagers who had no support from either our, or Vietnam governments.

I personally never recovered from that trauma of the Vietnam War, and it cost me my family in the years to follow. I still cannot trust others' morales, nor even my own, and struggle with many of the same value-issues that ""China Beach"" characters embody in the TV series.

1490041,5,B00005JMSD,"China Beach, like many other great shows, was set in a very specific place and time.  One major way that shows help enhance the feel and set the tone for an era is with the music.  Herein lies the rub.  For Warner Bros to release the show on DVD as it was originally aired they would have to reacquire the licensing rights to ALL of the music from each individual owner of each songs copyrights.  Every artist or company for each and every song played would have to be paid and contracted to individually.  They (WB) see this as too much of a hassle or cost prohibitive.  The only solution apparently is to replace all the copyrighted music with ""original"" music.  This may not seem like a big deal at first but this idea has RUINED several DVD releases already, Quantum Leap being the most obvious.  This same issue has kept 'The Wonder Years' from DVD for decades.  No solution is in sight.  It always is and always will be all about the money. The only solution is to make it clear to WB that we, the fans, are willing to pay a little extra for the DVDs and make it worth their while.  But can you imagine the opening sequence of China Beach WITHOUT Diana Ross and The Supremes?? I'd rather buy a bootleg and take my chances.",1255392000,9,1228,4.318777292576419

When the paraplegic sees her walking out, to go back to China Beach, and he yells ""That's my nurse!  THAT'S MY NURSE!"" I just felt so proud to have known her.

The characters were so well acted by each and every actor that you felt as if you knew them personally.  One of the most fascinating accomplishments was how you got to know both the good and bad sides of these people, set with the Vietnam war as a backdrop.  Obviously, the war made the personalities intensify.

1490117,5,B00005JMSD,"This show ran from the time I was 9 until I was 12, and I was absolutely in love with it. War movies and TV shows have never particularly been my first choice...maybe because I've always been overly sensative and it's hard to see so much pain...maybe it's because I'm a girld and it usually seems to be more of a guy genre, but in any case this is a TV show that takes place during the Vietnam war mainly centered around the doctors and nurses that run the hospital at the R & R base at China Beach. The stories are well writen and well acted...I was so obsessed with this show that once I found out that the show was going off the air I taped the last 7 episodes so that I would at least have something to watch in the future. Back then I never dreamed that one day (not to many years away) companies would start releasing TV shows on DVD...I'm am still a huge fan of this deeply moving show! With the writing, acting, and visuals coming together so beautifully in this show I am very, very, very hopeful that it will soon be released on DVD.

The provider of my copy recorded the shows off of the History Channel (logo in corner).  I'm about 1/2 way through and so far, 2 episodes are completely missing and 2 are repeated.  I don't know who the provider of Amazon.com's copies will be/is, but we are going to try again and hope for a cleaner, better copy with all the episodes.  We are trying to get at least part of our money back on the DVD's I have now.  I recorded China Beach off Lifetime years ago onto VHS tapes but they are too old now and aren't watchable.  I love China Beach and, although I wasn't born until 1971, I relate to several of the characters and the 1960's in general.  This series was, and is, a considerable influence on my life and values.  Excellent TV that was canceled way too soon!

9-16-2010 UPDATE: We weren't able to get our money back for the apparently bootleg DVD's.  They are poorly edited - you hear the beep to tell them to cut but they cut parts of the scenes.  Several episodes are missing while others are repeated.  They recorded the shows off History and Lifetime and sometimes the picture and sound are terrible.  Amazon - make sure your supplier isn't offering bootleg copies.  Customers - if you find a place to get the DVD's, buyer beware.  My Mom spent over $70 on this bootleg box set, purchased from a website that looked completely safe and legal.  They refused to honor their money back guarantee.  Be careful.

Whatever the reason, this show used to make me laugh and cry, (usually both) at least once or twice during every episode. ""Those dissapointing eyes"" of ""Murph's"" KC's ambition and drive which she used to cover her woundedness. Boonie's caring nature. I loved all of those charaters and followed them even after my tour of duty was up. I followed them on ""Lifetime"" and ""The History Channel"" and have pleaded with everyone I could call or write to please bring back the show but, to no avail.
 The comeraderie I was developing and experiencing in my own life while serving in the Army helped me to understand, appriciate and connect with these character's all of them, in real life and on the show China Beach. I still am in contact with several friends I made in the Army at the time. But, I still miss my old friends on China Beach and I sure hope I can see them again on DVD. The entertianment industry baffles me. They don't want people to download items without paying for them but ""they"" don't offer a way we can get them and pay for them. It's very frustrating.

A war seen through the lives of these brave people. It told us through these charactors how the friendships during this time made them stronger.  It also showed how ""no one"" can understand what it is like unless you've been there as portrayed by Delaney when she went home for a visit. She didn't want to forget the smells and the people. I can't seem to forget that particuliar episode.  Her mother went and threw away her clothes/uniform in the trash because her mom said they smelled terrible.

Almost all of us, know or knew, someone that was in or part of that War, and
it still today, effects many many people.

China Beach, has to rate as one of the top shows about the Vietnam War, because it comes from a different angle, yes it has combat scenes,
but then it shows what happens when the battle is over, and the wounded and dead, come to the hospital and morgue, and how it
effects those that have the job to take care of them.

I've had two tours in Iraq in the past four years and was wounded during each tour, each time requiring medical evacuation out of Iraq due to the seriousness of my injuries.  Soldiers in these situations suddenly feel very vulnerable and I can attest to the fact that it is the military medical staff, especially the nurses, who provide the comfort and reassurance that's so desperately needed.  My wife, also in the military as an intensive care nurse, recently returned from her second tour in Iraq.  She, like all the nurses in her ward, were emotionally struggling with the constant flow of critically injured patients, American and Iraqi Soldiers as well as injured Iraqi women and children.  One of the pictures she sent me that I most cherish is of her bottle-feeding a 6-month old Iraqi baby recovering from surgery to repair his crushed skull received when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of civilians.  I sent my wife a copy of both the China Beach premier episode as well as Dana Delaney's tribute to Vietnam nurses, believing she might find some comfort in them.  At first she didn't want to watch the DVD's, thinking they would only remind her of the hell she was living in every day.  When she finally watched them, she discovered a connection with the Vietnam nurses and realized that most of her experiences were the same for military nurses in every conflict.  She realized that the emotions she was struggling with were not unique to her and that it was ""normal"" to have these feelings.  She shared the videos with the other members of her combat support hospital, who also found them comforting.  My wife never saw the China Beach series before and I now want to get the complete set even more so we can both enjoy it together.  I strongly believe that there is a whole new generation of military medical practicioners, wounded veterans, and struggling military families that would find comfort in this series.

Forcing the studio not to release the show only reduces general awareness and DVD ""airplay"" of their product - a feedback forum like this shows that they are even managing to expressly alienate some of their prime customers.

I recently had to throw the entire collection away after msot of the tapes were either damaged in a recent move, or as in the first episode - watched so many times it was worn out... :)

I am anxious for this series to release onto DVD.

Truly, this is a well-written, extraordinarily acted series.  MANY huge successes had stint on this show - Forrest Whitaker for instance.

Rights for the songs used in the series are mostly held by Warner Publishing. So go figure.,1180224000,6,403,4.315789473684211
1490304,5,B00005JMSD,"From what I understand, the hold up for the release of this wonderful series is the music rights.  Unfortunately, the classic songs which were used in the China Beach series are expensive to get the rights too.  I know there are several other shows that have gotten around this problem by re-editing the episodes with different songs than that with which they originally aired.  However, the specific music used in each CB episode is such a powerful and integrated part of that story I don't think that solution would work with this series.  Therein lies the problem.  I would be curious how much each season set would cost us consumers, music rights and all.  This was such an extraordinary show, I would be willing to pay more than the ""going rate"" to own it.  Maybe if the ""Powers-That-Be"" would release it as one big box set and market it for the Christmas/Holiday season then perhaps they could charge enough without people baulking at a large price?",1179964800,7,955,4.716867469879518

The core group of actors meshed well together.

I loved the interaction and friendship that developed between Colleen McMurphy and all the other females. Cherry (nieve farm-girl - donut dolly); KC (businesswoman/prostitute), the Major (highest ranking female)...

This series shows how people of different backgrounds, different religions, different colors, different job titles, different EVERYTHING can bond together and become friends when they are on ""like"" journey's together (trying the best they can to survive the turbulence around them while continueing to live each day).

I was a teenager during the Viet Nam era but I remember:  the news each night on TV; my cousins being drafted; the braclet I wore for years (he came back); the anger I felt at the treatment of the returning troops.

I crave this series.

It boggles my mind to see all the LAME shows out on DVD, which have no substance, and still not see China Beach available.

I am fortunate that I get the American Life TV network so I am able to see it week after week. It's a series that I never get tired of watching. M.A.S.H. has been released in various forms why not China Beach. I have written to various places to inquire & have never received a response.

The truth, the humanity of the series touched me and helped heal me.  We all want this series on DVD with any special material that would be available.

I, like most of us guys, was in love with Dana (McMurphy).  The girl next door, who had that hard edge but was our saving grace while in the hospital and they stayed in our dreams.  I doubt there were many guys my age who didn't want to just hold McMurphy and comfort her at her times of crisis.

KC was our 'hottie' and it is wonderful to see Marg on CSI as a bright intellegent lady.

I totally agree with all reviews that I have read thus far in relation to this show being the best that TV has had to offer since I can't remember when. However, I was concerned reading one reviewer's comment that her VHS tapes had molded and were no good. I have just brought out two of my tapes to check (Tape 1B: China Men, How to Stay Alive in Viet Nam part 1 & 2, Magic, Nightfall, Holly's Decision and Tape 8:  Waiting for Beckett, Brothers, Chao Ong, Lost and Found II, Limbo) and they are in perfect condition. I have tapes 1 thru 14 with only two not listed individually in my notebook and only one episode taped twice. I have 84 episodes but do not know how many episodes there were in a season so I have no real idea if I have every last episode. However, since the ""Powers That Be"" will not release this show, you can rest assured that I will be transferring from VHS over to disk and they can whistle Dixie if/and/or when they ever decide to release the DVDs because I already own them.

They don't make shows like this anymore - shows about normal people trying to cope with an actual horrendous situation (and not an imaginary/escapist situation like on Lost).  China Beach was realistic, didn't moralize, and showed how a war affects people long after it's over. It wouldn't fly in the current cultural climate - and it definitely wouldn't be shown on the major networks.

Besids its realism, one of the best aspects of the show, and one that makes it almost unique, is that its two focal characters were women (Army Nurse Colleen McMurphy and business woman/call girl KC from KC).  And they were also very interesting and flawed women.  Even the best adult shows today like The Sopranos, tend to focus on men.  The only characters on tv now that come close to the complexity and toughness of McMurphy and KC are on genre shows like Battlestar Galactica and Veronica Mars.

So will we ever get the DVDs to prove that network tv once created a mainstream show centered around women that tackled a bleak chapter of American History?  Hopefully.",1159574400,57,1301,4.675438596491228

But to be honest, this show wasn't an interest, it was almost an obsession. Every week, I remember making my schedule around this show. The cast was stellar, a launching pad for many stars today (Helgenberger, Picardo, Delany - my personal favorite - Lake, Boatman). Every song aired during an episode added to the story, and I am sure brought memories to those alive during the time. The realism was phenominal, I am not going to claim that I know what was going on in peoples minds during the war - or whatever you want to call it - but it seems to me that watching boys die would have an impact on people, and that impact was portrayed beautifully. The camera work was beyond compare in it's time and is still among the best. There was someone for everyone to relate to, and when a castmember would die, it impacted each viewer. I know that this review is scattered, but I wasn't expecting to write one. This show was absolutely phenominal and I wish that it will be released soon (in tact) so that it can be enjoyed by everyone.

What I love about this is the focus on the struggles of the people in a war, that wasn't a war.  In a time when people were not recognized for the bravery that they exhibited.  There was no sugar coating the subject of their strife.  It is irreverent, sarcastic and funny, poignant, heart breaking and truthful.

This was about humanity....about everyday folks serving their country - perhaps a bit naievely (sp?) at first, but trying their best to deal with the horrors of war overseas. The relationships were real, the emotions were not forced, the stark contrast between war and the efforts those at China Beach undertook to give the field soldiers some R&R, a glimpse of home in a horrible time was not only uplifting but heart-breaking. I cried at many an episode, empathizing so closely with McMurphy and Co. I was disheartened when this series left the air - it seemed that so many stories were left only partially told.

Unfortunately, since I was not sure what I would ever do with them, they were erased or recorded over except one tape (which I treasure). This series would be good for people to see now to realize the number of soldiers who came home wounded both physically and mentally from that war are not any different from the soldiers coming home from this war. Plus, the mental state of all the doctors, nurses and the rest of the health care providers who are currently caring for the wounded in this war.

They just don't get any goofier than this.  and they're probably being paid outrageous salaries based on their goofiness.

Like every other person reviewing this series I'd give almost anything to have a legitimate full set of DVD's of this series.  I've purchased the bootleg versions where someone with a canmcorder filmed old reruns directly off his TV but they suck to high heaven.

When will these people realize there's a market out here for this series?  I recently saw where they had a DVD of the ""Best of Mr. Ed"" and also the old ""Sky King"" series.  They can market those like anyone really wants to buy them and they skip over China Beach--one of two definitive series on the Vietnam War (along with Tour of Duty)?

1490470,5,B00005JMSD,"China Beach set new standards for television realism and quality, illuminating the daily life of the many women in-country whose stories had never been told. Created by William Broyles, Jr. and Charles Sacret Young (Broyles is a Vietnam Vet who has written many things, including the film ""Apollo 13th"" and the recent ""Jarhead""), ""China Beach"" gave us the beautiful but forever damaged nurse Colleen McMurphy (an extraordinarily luminous Dana Delany), K.C. (Marg Helgenberger) a prostitute/businesswoman with a past that has compressed her into a hard, stunning diamond, female soldiers, Red Cross workers, civilians, journalists--all trying to make their mark and do what had never been permitted to them before, and of course lots of men in various states of daily understated acts of bravery (generally called ""heroism"" by non-soldiers), profound friendship, love, and terrible physical and psychic anguish, all desperately trying to deal with who they were in that place at that time. For those who have only seen Robert Picardo on ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" he was exceptional in ""China Beach"" as both a doctor struggling to accept the draft (many doctors were drafted after few volunteered) that traded his quiet life as gynecologist and family man in Boston, to on-the-edge evac hospital surgeon facing wounds no one had ever seen before (much of our current trauma surgery's technique was learnt on the fly in Vietnam), and McMurphy's truest, deepest friend there. The holographic doctor he played never got close to the intensity of this role, and I hope people who missed China Beach someday soon get to see how good he could be. Also great were Jeff Kober (recently seen as the evil magic dealer who hooked Willow on mad mojo on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), as the silent, sensitive uber-grunt, Dodger; Concetta Tomei as Lila Garreau, the career army Major who has left nursing behind in order to try to join the ranks but never makes it to the top; young Nan Woods who, as the ""donut dollie"" who went to Vietnam to find her MIA brother, shone as she was transformed from girl to woman, but who never acted again. I should name them all, and will if this review gets a DVD to go with it. Suffice to say that few of the actors on this show ever got to work at such a level again (including Helgenberger, who may be on the #1- watched show, but whose show isn't even in the same league).

China Beach was so vivid and compelling that it was actually taken off the air during Desert Storm out of, apparently, governmental fear that it would generate anti-war feelings here at home (as though those feelings didn't already exist). I don't believe any other show has been taken so seriously. It was cancelled (that it had been on the air was a miracle in the first place), but with plenty of notice in its third season, allowing its creators to go into the future of its main characaters to see how, 25 yrs. later, they were coping (or failing to cope) with their experiences; it also allowed them to place their characters in important moments in history that especially affected vets (such as the Florida Republican Convention where Ron Kovic made his stand). Its final 2-hr. episode ends, appropriately enough, with a reunion that goes beyond the reception hall all the way through a long night drive to the Wall in Washington; we get the pain of Vietnam brought full circle for us, from McMurphy's first fumbling day in-country to a day a lifetime later, with all her former comrades-in-arms with her, weeping in the dawn light at the most astonishing War Memorial ever built. On the drive, we both see and she tells the grown daughter of K.C. about her last day at China Beach: ""I stood there watching before I left--and it was exactly the same as the day I got there,"" along with the moving story of her last patient on what is sadly his final day. During her years there we see her go from genuine optimism about life to paying for that optimism and compassion almost with her life, then, as with the others, unable to stop paying and find some capacity for joy again. McMurphy stands in for all those men and women we lost in one way or another so long ago, so far away, yet still live among us in varying states of wellness.

Having chosen to begin the show during the months before the war turned from American hope to American nightmare on 31st Jan 1968(after Tet and its devestation is over, Major Lila Garreau who is ""regular, career Army"" says mournfully, ""We've lost our wonderful, wonderful war.""), the creators were able to show how the morale of the soldiers eroded, how optimism became despair, how an emergency trip home exposes McMurphy to what's happened back in the World, where everything's both changed and just the same--she realizes that what's changed is her: she cannot bear that people are playing tennis as though nothing's wrong; America's willful myopia has become untenable). This myopia is revealed in many ways; even Lila's comment illustrates one of the problems of Vietnam--the generational perception gap that existed on the ground between the ""grunts"" in the field and their clueless superior officers who were still fighting a la WW II. For the grunts, it was never a ""wonderful"" war, but a muddy mess of blood and fear and courage despite it. For the officers, for Washington, it was a mystery that it couldn't be ""won."" Any of those so-called grunts could have told them why it would never be won, but no one asked them, so they slogged on and through it's intimate style, we're with them, with the nurses and doctors who have to try to put them back together when an anti-personnel device made by the VC of nails and screws and sharp bits of metal from a fallen chopper has torn their bodies apart, or after napalm has burnt all their flesh off. It's not always comfortable to watch, but doing so reminds one that this is still what it's like in much of the world (I always watch the ""X-mas, '67, VN"" ep on the 25th of December to remind me of just that), and reminds us that we can't forget. Ever.

CB was a gorgeous show that missed nothing, was completely fearless (dealing even with the issue of men who by '69 were shooting themselves in order to get home), and so solidly built on truth and exceptional performances that it has never been forgotten, either. And the stories were told with grace, humor, wit, allowing us to experience the joy of small moments of quiet or wild moments of desperation-tinged fun suddenly interrupted by incoming mortars. Nor were the Vietnamese marginalized or made into caricatures. One of the mysteries of this war is how many of the men fell in love with the people, the country, the culture (see Robert Olen Butler's books) and how many chose to desert the army to join it. Their stories are told, as are those of many Vietnamese. Broyles and Young make sure we don't fool ourselves into easy thinking, but rather examine the whole story. I doubt they'd be allowed such freedom in the current political climate. That they were at all is an exceptional thing. So good was it that many people showed up to participate: Diane Keaton directed the excellent ep ""Fever""; Gary Sinise directed, Kathy Bates played a key role in one of the ""home"" episodes; Chloe Webb, fresh from ""Sid and Nancy"" was a guest star in the pilot and 1st 6 eps; and it was here that Mimi Leder became a director--one whose ER episodes were instantly noticable and who went on to become the first woman action-film director (though I'd have wanted her to make different films).

In terms of production values, they were so high that the episode where a main character, Booney, ends up having to go home was perhaps the most difficult, challenging, cinematic television episode ever filmed by that point (1989-90). Its realism is beyond harrowing--one forgets this is ""fiction."" Maybe because it really isn't...

I, like another reviewer, still watch all 56 episodes on my tapes, but would really, really like to see it on DVD, with commentary, footage from the war perhaps, and more nurses and female soldiers telling their stories (they did some of this on the show).

It feels nearly criminal to have ""Bewitched, season 56"" on DVD, but not this show. Please, please get on it! Thank you!!

[For Dana Delany fans, might I recommend ""True Women,"" in which she plays the real woman who bravely led the women away from Santa Ana's army in Texas on what was called the Runaway Scrape; ""Light Sleeper,"" where her part is small but her performance excellent, and where she acts again for Paul Schrader, who gave her her first real role in ""Patty Hearst""; ""Wild Palms""; and ""Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story"" (M.S. founded Planned Parenthod and suffered for it). Search on her name to get a full list, and watch your Premium Channels for lesser-known movies. She also starred as a Healer in a remake of the film ""Ressurection,"" which I have on tape from TV, but seems never to have been sold. Sadly, she never really has gotten the chance to shine again as she did here. She also writes notes to her fans on the official Dana Delany fan site, for those who care about such things. It's a site worth at least a look, as it's warm and caring and a bit  unusual.]",1143849600,260,9224,4.69302038295244

China Beach, for me, embodied the spirit and the emotional climate of my adolescence.

I must admit that my first memories of a crush were born out of seeing Dana Delany, with her serenely cropped hair, mystify me with those majestic hazel brown eyes.

While I was one of those kids who actually DIDN'T spend a lot of time in front of the tube, baking my noodle on a daily basis, I must admit that I did make sure to have my back side planted on the couch when my parents tuned in to this show.

I, therefore,  adamantly and ardently stand behind, not only the fellow supporters on this site, but also the thousands of other China Beach fans out there, and re-enforce the continued request to have the ""powers-that-be"" conclusively provide this classic piece of television history on DVD, so that we may all finally reminisce in its ceaseless endearment.",1109980800,8,1052,4.639784946236559

These glimpses into characters and situations as well written as many novels led me to seek out discarded copies of recorded shows, occasionally  buying on ebay at usurious prices.

This speaks to the power of China Beach as classic television and timeless storytelling.  The depth and realism of the characters is the strongest element of the series.  As Socrates said and few of us remember, great virtue and miserable flaws exist side by side in the same person.  McMurphy, the protagonist and heroine contrasts the predictable characteristics of the ministering angel as a nurse in a field hospital during the VietNam war with the corresponding flaws of a self-righteous, hypocritical, sometimes misogynistic good girl.  The prostitute, K.C.,  has not only that well trammeled  heart of gold and a heart of greed, but both turn out to be armour for a strong woman avoiding as best she can the pain she knows life will inevitably dish out.

I recently purchased a copy of the pilot episode on VHS tape (China Beach)and once again was reminded how well the series was put together. Like many others I want to own all of the series on DVD and hope that chance will come. Dana Delany was outstanding in this role and touches the heart. Through her you see what it is like to see young men dying or dealing with terrible, life altering injuries and how hopeless she feels when she can not save them. Yet she knows the important part she plays to those dying boys as the voice and touch that represents the mothers, wives, lovers, and sisters of those who are dying far from home. They are not dying alone when she is there. Others in the cast are outstanding as well. The Gal that played Cherry the donut girl, and the back up singer turned lead, when the pretty one can't stay well enough to sing. She came to meet the boys-a-rama ,but soon was doing much more to touch the hearts of those at war. This is not a drama about the fighting in the field, but about the nurses and doctors in the field and the soldiers that go through their hospital. This is not Mash in Vietnam! This is a serious drama that will have you crying for all those dead and wounded soldiers wasted on battlefields around the other side of the world fighting an unpopular war. Each deals with the stress in their own way, but you can not watch this series without it touching you deeply and emotionally. If you lived during the Vietnam years then this will bring back the emotions of those times. If for no other reason this series should be put on DVD to honor the nurses, Doctors, entertainers, and donut girls that tried to bring a touch of home to the troops in Vietnam. To those who were wounded and survived and the many who did not this series should be available and remembered.

I hope they release the series out on DVD. I will definately buy the whole series lot.",1084233600,4,437,4.141176470588236
1490716,5,B00005JMSD,"I grew up as the war in Vietnam was ending, however, despite my age at the time I find myself being drawn to and fascinated by the era and the Vietnam War. I don't think any drama in TV history has better captured a real event like China Beach has captured the Vietnam War. The raw emotion that came through the characters seems unheard of anymore in TV. I fell in love with Dana Delaney, both her character portrayal and her. She was so perfect for the role. This is a great show that should be shared with other generations for years to come.
[PLEASE]release this show, all seasons on DVD, I will be the first to order it!",1083888000,3,624,4.2521008403361344
1490717,5,B00005JMSD,"With all the fluff and garbage out there on DVD , why has this gem been overlooked? Along with Tour Of Duty , China Beach is one of the best series about this period in our history, and tells a story that needs telling! Please bring us all three seasons on DVD as soon as possible. Five Stars!!",1083456000,6,294,4.086206896551724
1490718,5,B00005JMSD,"I remeber first watching this series in high school, and then occassionally in syndication.  Byfar and away the fourth and final season was my favorite; I remember seeing some of the episodes being rebroadcast on the History Channel in 2001.  During this time, I had just relocated to Chicago, had no friends or relatives in the area, and was starting my residency in Anesthesia. Needless to say, the angst I was experiencing at the time was often relieved each evening (when I was able to get home, that is!) by viewing some of my favorite episodes from the final season.  I explicitley remember viewing ""I Could Have Danced All Night...But Didn't"" and ""Hello Goodbye"" just prior to the September 11 events; my own worries/fears/insecurities regarding that day, my lonliness in a new profession and new city, and eventually, my willingness to survive after being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy while at the same time caring for others all made more relevant by what I had initially thought to be a ""cheesy medicowar drama"", but later regarded as poignent art.  Please rerelase this series on DVD; I will join the throngs of others willing to lay down my money in order to preserve the show's posterity.",1083369600,5,1244,4.937799043062201
1490719,5,B00005JMSD,"I really want this show to come out on DVD. I remember watching as a teenager and couldn't wait to for the next episode. It was an excellent show and I liked the fact that the main protaganist was a female, that meant a lot to me at the time. It showed a different aspect of the Vietnam War that many people might not have known.",1079481600,3,329,4.0
1490720,5,B00005JMSD,"This show was an amazing example of what television can be. The acting was unbelievable and the casting perfect. At a time when the Vietnam War period is just ancient history to younger people and while war is still being promoted, this drama shows how war affects not only the military personnel, but also the citizens of the country where the fighting is happening. Dana Delaney, Marg Helgenberger, Conchetta Tomei and Robert Picardo are stellar as is the sublime Chloe Webb. This show should be released so that people can remember it and it can be viewed by people who have never seen it before. This was the Vietnam War, but it could be any war. And, there is a killer soundtrack behind the drama.",1077840000,4,702,4.624
1490721,5,B00005JMSD,"This is one of the best shows in the history of Television.
PLEASE put this show on DVD. It was and remains one of the finest shows about the Vietnam Experience, I STILL rewatch the video of the pilot episode.
Why in heavens name have some of these subpar sitcoms been released on DVD and we're STILL waiting for this touching, funny, thoughtful show to make its way to the medium?
Dana Delaney is quite simply riveting. She inhabits the skin of the battleweary nurse Colleen McMurphy so well that I suspect people had a hard time accepting her as anything else. Marge Helgenberger manageds to show K.C.'s heart without compromising her strength. There are too many episodes that were brilliant I cant even pick one favorite! Every single episode was a rare gem.
Infidels! Get off your heinies and put this show out on DVD.
Please.",1076544000,12,831,4.659863945578231

This series was based on stories from nurses, Red Cross, USO,and others who were actually there.  In interviews you  hear them tell their stories, then later...there it is in the show.  It makes it real in a way I have never seen. You could put this series on the air today and it would blow everything else out of the water.  It's that good.  Dodger was my favorite.  He never said much, but he didn't have to...his face and eyes said it all.",1521849600,2,706,4.32824427480916

7939941,5,B00005JMSD,"A show that was never shown here in the UK, but which I kept reading and hearing so much about from forums and friends.

What can I say but wow, what a truly fantastic show with so many amazing episodes and so many clever storylines delivered with absolute conviction by an utterly stellar cast, anybody who thinks of Robert Picardo as a one note actor only has to watch him here to realise how he has been misused in the decades since, Dana Delaney also owns this series with her alternately heartbreaking and powerfully emoted scenes, special mention also goes to Jeff Kober who takes what could have been a stereotypical damaged vietnam soldier ""dodger"" and turns him into a multifaceted human being trying his best to survive and make the world a better place.

For an amazing look at the vietnam war from the perspective of those who lived it and approved it's storylines and themes you could not do any better than China Beach",1518048000,2,932,4.608433734939759

7939945,3,B00005JMSD,"This show says way, way, way more about the time it was made in than the one it is set in. But it still has some dramatic viewing worth. And Dana Delaney is a great looking lead. Realize one thing however. In 1956 North Vietnam committed a brutal mass-murder in a land reform. They killed tens of thousands of their own civilian NV's in it. You'd never hear about this on this show as a reason for being in Nam.",1509926400,,411,4.15
