189866,4,1572522321,"It's hard to say anything unkind about 'The 4 Musketeers', which I just saw and liked, though i'd say the first one ended more satisfactorily. 'The 3 Musketeers' could pretty much stand on it's own without the continuation of the saga, yet that saga does continue in part 2, 'The 4 Musketeers'.  Everything moves along in the same manner of elegance, 'Pythonesque' undertones, and dirty, yet chivalrous, brawling. If I had to criticize though, I'd say there seemed to be more fight sequences and less story in this one, or maybe just the story had not as many interesting elements as the first one. This time Raquel Welch (Constance) has been captured, while Faye Dunaway is dead set on having her and D'Artagnan, plus the king of England assassinated with the bishop's silent approval.  Heston continues to do a great job as the bishop - I don't think I've seen him in a more likeable role than this (no kidding).  He's multi-layered and subtle in his villainy - something I haven't come across in his acting in the few movies I've seen him in (where he usually just plays a macho guy).  Raquelle Welch is less prominent than in the first, while Faye Dunaway spends much more time on screen - she does an incredible job as a steely hearted snake-woman in the service of 'the state' and her own private vendattas.

As for the dvd, it's a real shame there are no English subtitles. I should mention my dvd is a Japanese zone 2 version, which has subtitles in other languages, but not English. I find subtitles really bring the script out (and the story) especially in a movie like this where antiquated British English being muttered or spoken quickly gets muddled, and I find myself having to concentrate harder than I would if the words were there in front of me, i.e. subtitles - this movie, of any, should have them - even for native speakers!

'The 4 Musketeers' was a good movie and I had to see it after enjoying the first one so much.  Still, part of the charm of the first one, and with more comic effect, was that D'Artagnan had to prove himself one of the musketeers - as being more than just a country oaf, that he was in fact a true swordsman with all the dignity and sense of 'honor' that was required (which was so perfectly taken to ridiculous proportions in the 'The 3 Musketeers').  As this has already been established when 'The 4 Musketeers' begins, what we are left with is a helluva lot of fight scenes which, while not bad (one in particular reminded me of Monty Python's 'the Holy Grail') also don't carry as much interest as the content of 'The 3 Musketeers'.  All the characters are still their same likeable selves which will be fun for any fan of the first to see, but expect less than what you got in the first and you'll probably have more fun with this one.  Of the two, 'The 4 Musketeers' is slightly darker, with Faye Dunaway's venomous intentions guiding much of the action and forming the plot.",1205625600,,2928,4.528409090909091
189867,3,1572522321,"Some directors should know when they have to stop transforming European or French popular literature into some kind of superficial merry-go-round circus. In this case, even the title is absurd. There has never been in the wide popular conscience of the French any fourth musketeer.

These are three even when they are legions. And everyone from seven to seventy-seven knows that the famous three musketeers were four and yet they remain three for all these people. The producer has been very careful to find another title for the French version of this film, of course. A king who is childish and infatuated with his own vanity. A cardinal Richelieu who is vicious and so easily tricked.

Fortifications in ruins in the 17th century. A monkey on some roost in Paris. A little bit of unrevealed, though suggested, sex and no nudity beyond the limits of normal bathing suits of the very early 1940s. Even some American Indians in London. A lot of horse-riding, with or without saddles.

More duels and fencing than real sword fights. Even some kind of a fire in some stables and at least two people killed, one by murder, the other by duelling, in a French Roman catholic monastery. All that superficial and exotic stuff for an audience that is seen as not able to look at some more profound reflections on this troubled century. That's what happens when a French classic is rehatched and rebaked in some Californian sauce and served with ketchup and cole slaw. It becomes champagne without the bubbles or Perrier without the water. Flat.

189868,4,1572522321,"In this entertaining sequel to THE THREE MUSKETEERS, Oscar winner and undoubtedly lovely Faye Dunaway steals the show as the wickedly deceptive Milady De Winter.  The film was actually shot at the same time as its predecessor, so director Richard Lester adds on some offscreen narrative to refresh the memories of those who might have forgotten the original.

Dunaway, however, maintains the most presence in this one, in which her sordid past is revealed, including a marriage to one of our musketeers! Dunaway preens, sneers, and plots deliciously, and gives an astoudingly realistic performance.  All of our original stars are back, and still after watching both movies, wonder why Richard Chamberlain wasn't given more to do; he's basically decorative and unnecessary except for maintaining the numbers.  Christopher Lee is dastardly as Dunaway's henchman; Charlton Heston chews up his scenes as the villainous Richelieu; Jean Pierre Cassel and Geraldine Chaplin return as the king and queen, but don't have a lot to do in this one; Raquel Welch in a smaller role, maintains her comic mastery; Simon Ward does little as Buckingham.  Oliver Reed and Frank Finlay continue their comic swordplay, although Reed's character takes on a somber tone.  Michael York, who looks positively anorexic, does have the flair and youthful innocence of D'Artagnan.

The movie itself is a lot darker than the original, and even though it has light moments, there is a more serious and deadly undertone in this one.

A delightful film nonetheless and both adventures are worth your time.",1095638400,,1572,5.2103174603174605
189869,5,1572522321,"Immediately following the events of the previous installment, Rochefort kidnaps D'artagnan's lover Constance. D'artagnan, unconscious after fighting the kidnappers, is taken in by the seductive Milady who is used by the control-hungry Cardinal Richelieu to distract him. With France at war with Protestants, The Duke Of Buckingham plans to send ships to aid the rebels. The Cardinal is going to have Milady assassinate The Duke by any means necessary. The Musketeers must prevent this for the sake of the Queen who is having an affair with the Duke. Not only this, but the Musketeers must also protect D'Artagnan and Constance from Milady (After Constance is rescued from the place where she is held), for she plans to wreck horrible revenge on both for humiliating her in the previous film.
This is not a sequel; it is merely different packaging since both film were supposed to be one. Aside from that fact, ""The Four Musketeers"" is an incredibly good continuation of the story. While it manages to blend slapstick and swashbuckling action well, the slapstick is less goofy and the action is more brutal (whether these are pros or cons I'll let you decide). Some may not enjoy the murders of many of the more significant characters, as they occur rather suddenly. The performances are very enjoyable, the humor is excellent, the final battles are intense towards the end, and the conclusion is extremely satisfying. See it!
Followed by: The Return Of The Musketeers.
Overall rating: 5 stars
Rated PG: contains brutal violence including a beheading, some language, adult themes, sexual encounters. However, I don't think many people will find this overly offensive.",1072137600,3,1666,5.1286764705882355
189870,4,1572522321,"Not nearly as much fun as the first film, The Three Musketeers, this conclusion to the story of D'Artagnon, Athos, Porthos & Aramis and their efforts to thwart the machinations of Cardinal Richelieu, de Rochefort, and Milady DeWinter, is much more plot-heavy and somber than the original, and includes some jarring assassinations and murders.
Benefiting greatly by having the same wonderful cast (both films were shot at one time), it continues where the first film left off, with clever and ironic period detail and wry observations, this time not only about the twit aristocracy, but about religious fanaticsm, persecution and wars (Protestant and Catholics)as well.
The wit and intelligence is still here, but some of the elan is missing.  There is so much plot to be disposed of that the film seems more hurried and less relaxed than the first.  There are some good fights, especially one clever and funny bit on an icy stream, and a brutal fight at the finale in a nunnery that climaxes with de Rochefort (the marvelously arch and disdainful Christopher Lee) and D'Artagnon (Michael York) dueling in the chapel.  Again, the sword fighting is FIGHTING, using both hands and feet, and with the participants becoming exhausted by their efforts.
The cast, as mentioned, is superb, with Heston as the wily Cardinal, Jean Pierre Cassel as the dim King, Geraldine Chaplain the ninny of a Queen, a wonderful Raquel Welch as Constance, the aforementioned Chris Lee & Michael York, and the great Oliver Reed as the moody and explosive Athos, Richard Chambelain the aloof Aramis, and Frank Finlay the vain & pompous Porthos.  I neglected to mention Roy Kinnear as the long-suffering servant, Planchet, in my review of the earlier film.  He's wonderful, as he always was, and lost his life in making this film.
Full of wry bits of business and humorous asides, and ironic contrasts, the Four Musketeers has the great benefit of continuity of cast and style and tone, although the tone shifts much darker and more plot-driven here.  Not as good as the first film, but well worth your while.  Compared to the witless films that more often than not make up our present world, these gems seem better and better for their audacity and intelligence. 4-1/2 stars.",1056931200,2,2249,4.949602122015915
189871,1,1572522321,"This one was actually filmed back to back with the first movie, and was released in 1975. It features the same great cast and finishes up the story from the book ""The Three Musketeers"".
Same cast as before. Oliver Reed as Athos, Richard Chamberlain as Aramis, Frank Finlay as Porthos, Michael York as D'Artagnan. Christopher Lee, Raquel Welch, Geraldine Chaplin, Faye Dunaway. Again, just about every performance is amazing. And what's sort of sad is that the actors signed up for one ""project"" - so even though they put in enough material to do two complete films, they were only paid once. Ah well, we the viewers benefitted!
This tells the second half of the story from the book. The Queen was saved for ruin, and the musketeers are sent up to fight the Huguenots. The Cardinal is still after them, as is M'Lady. There are more battles, more attempts to kill the musketeers, more threats and plots. The mood turns darker in this one, as the fellowship runs into serious situations. The ending matches the book - not necessarily a ""happy"" ending but a satisfying one.
Again, the BIG WARNING. I wore out several copies of this video tape before getting this on the first DVD available. Fox Lorber put out the DVD version. I was thrilled to have it on DVD. I was less thrilled when I saw what they did to the movie!! They literally cut off ALL FOUR EDGES of the movie, losing quite a lot of the picture. The special features are completely missing. There is a new DVD version out which is a two-pack of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" that has the special features and has the full version of both movies without missing content. AVOID THE FOX LORBER VERSION and get the other one.",1048464000,40,1698,4.588815789473684
189872,1,1572522321,"Since we have bought many DVDs and borrowed many DVDs and all of them have captions or subtitles, I was cheated with this DVD - it has no captions/subtitles and I cannot enjoy this movie. I am hearing-impaired. This is one of only 3 of many many DVDs that do not have captions.",1011484800,8,277,4.245283018867925
189873,5,1572522321,"This sequel is just as entertaining as ""The Three Musketeers.""  The performances are again very strong.  It has all the elements as the first movie, comdey, action, adventure, but wraps up the story from Dumas' novel.
The movie focues' on Milady and her revenge to have D'Artagan and his lover killed.  This movie was film concurrently with the first, and it shows as the actors are in full form and do not miss a beat.  The conculsion is great as it ends with D'Artagan fighting the Count of Rochefort (played by Christopher Lee) is a wonderfully cheographed sword fight  (it is gritty and realistic looking) and then the pronouncment of death on Milady.
Another must see movie.  These two movies would be followed up by the entertianing, (however, not nearly as good as these movies)  ""The Return of the Musketeers"" where the four musketeers are re-united.",1011398400,,858,4.835616438356165
189874,4,1572522321,"I rented ""The Four Musketeers"" because I deeply enjoyed its predecessor, ""The Three Musketeers.""  ""Four"" is just as good if not better than the original film.
France is at war with Protestant rebels.  During this period of tumult, Milady(Faye Dunaway) is instructed by the Cardinal(Charlton Heston) to kill the Duke of Buckingham(Simon Ward) if he actively supports the rebels.  In return, Milady calls for the death of both D'Artagnan(Michael York) and Constance(Raquel Welch).
""The Four Musketeers"" offers a rare moment where a sequel is just as good if not better than its predecessor.  Those who thrived on the lighthearted humor of ""Three,"" however, need to be forewarned about this film: ""Four"" is much more serious and tragic than ""Three.""  Oliver Reed is great as Athos.  I'm sorry Reed never became a superstar and that he died at a somewhat young age.  The elegant Faye Dunaway is the very last of the great movie actresses and certainly one of its greatest villainesses; she is pure evil as Milady.  Christopher Lee is one of the great movie villains but he has rarely been given roles that do real justice to his great talent.  The ""Musketeers"" movies offer one of the exceptions.  Some would argue that Lee is more effective as the suave Rochefort than he ever was as Dracula.  Charlton Heston is so effective as the ruthless Cardinal that I'm surprised he hasn't played more villainous roles.
I very rarely find action movies that are as intelligent, exciting, and heartfelt as the ""Musketeers"" movies.  ""The Four Musketeers"" is very well-recommended.",995500800,2,1565,5.023255813953488

189882,5,1572522321,"Love any version of the Musketeers, and actor Michael York. IMHO, for decades I said the final show-down sword dual between D'artagnon and Rochefort was the best swords play EVER filmed (until the CGI and hundred-cuts together editing cliche' standard MO came along).  It seemed they expertly mastered the entire multi-minute choreography that seems it was shot in a single, uncut shot!!! Absolutely amazing and highly entertaining.",1406592000,,432,5.447761194029851

189886,1,1572522321,"First of all, it was a half-baked idea to split an already horrible movie into two parts, when the original novel wasn't split into two books. So many inconsistencies with the novel by Le Grand Dumas, it's atrocious that this movie ever got made, much like the trashy 1970 version of ""Wuthering Heights"" starring Timothy Dalton. Whoever hired Richard Lester (the idiot behind the stupid ""Movies"" ""Help!"" & ""It's Hard Day's Night"" & the utterly abominable ""Superman III""; ""Superman II"" wasn't entirely his fault, but firing Richard Donner halfway through filming and replacing him with this moron of a director was Warner Bros.' fault) to direct and whoever hired the screenwriter should have their heads examined...seriously. Here are several of the most obvious liberties taken with the novel ""Les Trois Mousquetaires."" Again, there are simply too many for me to list them all.

I. D'Artagnan never has sex with either Kitty or Milady. He never has sex with Madame Bonancieux, either.

II. Rochefort isn't killed by D'Artagnan. Rochefort and D'Artagnan become friends after D'Artagnan wounds him the third time they fight (this happens in the Epilogue). D'Artagnan accidentally kills Rochefort at the end of ""Vingt Ans Apres,"" the 2nd novel in the trilogy. The sequel to this abomination set up an inconsistency by bringing back Rochefort when it clearly states that he dies here.

III. Grimaud, Bazin & Mousqueton are omitted from the movie(s). All four had servants in the novel, not just D'Artagnan, as shown here.

IV. Constance isn't strangled by Milady, but poisoned.

V. D'Artagnan doesn't show grief when he finds Constance dead, but just walks out of the room. In the novel, D'Artagnan is utterly heart-broken when he finds Constance dying.

VI. Rochefort and Milady are not lovers in the novel.

VII. The back-story of Milady with the executioner of Bethune is omitted entirely.

VIII. The Musketeers fighting Rochefort's guards to free Constance never occurs in the novel.

IX. D'Artagnan and Rochefort never fight on ice.

X. D'Artagnan joins M. de Treville's company AFTER the siege of the bastion St. Gervais, NOT before.

XI. Lord De Winter is omitted from the novel, and his role combined with Buckingham.

XII. Felton and Milady never have sex.

XIII. Athos, Porthos & Aramis never see Constance until the carriage carrying her to the convent is passing by.

XIV. Milady wasn't executed in the day-time, but at night.

XV. Milady and Buckinghsm NEVER have sex.

AVOID this monstrosity, and view the Disney version. At least, the Disney version retains the spirit of the book. I personally don't mind libertties being taken with a novel (that's to be expected), but for a movie to deviate so broadly from the source material as this garbage did is nothing less than atrocious.

I have to refute some comments that have been made on this review. Calling me a buffon with a sex obsession merely because I pointed out that in the novel, neither Felton, Buckingham or D'Artagnan have sex with Milady nor does D'Artagnan have sex with either Madamae Bonancieux, Kitty or Milady is shallow and pointless. Clearly the screenwriter was on drugs when he wrote the script. He was thinking, ""I'll take one of the most famous novels of all time and add in shallow comedy, sex anddistort the author's story altogether."" I guess that was his mentality when he ruined one of the greatest novels of all time. Read the book and see the Disney version.",1281139200,3,3451,4.984320557491289
