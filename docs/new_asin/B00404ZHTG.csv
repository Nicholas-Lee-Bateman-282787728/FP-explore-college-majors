Be careful and don't get fooled by false 7.1 discs, because some people are just ""enlarging"" old records with stereo->7.1 conversion utilities.",1473465600,,339,4.947368421052632
8412069,1,B00404ZHTG,"Apparently Alexander Jero removed all of his products from Amazon and then relisted them as brand new products, thereby wiping out all the 1-star reviews that had accumulated. It saddens me that new unsuspecting music lovers may be tricked into buying these cheaply-made Acoustic Reality/Surround Records audio-only Blu-ray recordings.

Look at the review history for all the 5-star reviews for this product, and you'll see a pattern: a cabal of 10-20 people from blu ray dot com who unilaterally support the producer of these sub-par products, Alexander Jero, despite the fact that the recordings do not deliver. The performances are average, the surround experience lacking, and the overall product quality amateurish. From typos on the jacket to the BD-R disc seemingly burned at someone's computer, this is NOT what should be representing the future of Blu-ray audio.

You'll note that some of the 5-star reviewers use the exact same wording in every review they post for a Surround Records release. And in many cases, those guys can barely write in English, which is suspect.

A lot of these recordings are actually stereo recordings that have been manipulated and remixed as 7.1 DTS surround, and despite the clever attempt, you can't escape the source material.

While the musicians aren't bad, they're not the stunning reference-standard performances one would expect from the hyperbolic 5-star reviews.

So beware, and just know that this recording (and all the others by Surround Records) do not exemplify the potential of the Blu-ray format for classical music. Let's hope that either Jero finds better orchestras that can record natively in 7.1 DTS HD, or that another company jumps on the bandwagon and releases catalog titles that take advantage of superior recording technique and overall product quality.",1318809600,19,1820,5.283737024221454
