Unlike most standard Hollywood films where you know who's the good guy, who's the bad guy and who's the damsel in distress, this film is full of clever shifts and turns and some very good acting.",1330732800,6,280,4.166666666666667
4960378,5,B00656Z0B2,I really loved this film.  From the beginning there were so many twists and turns that I found it really enjoyable.  I feel it was well written and the actors did a fine job too.  I have seen many of Jim Haggerty's films and I believe this is one of his best!  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes suspense.,1330732800,3,329,4.174603174603175
4960379,3,B00656Z0B2,"This starts off seeming like a torture porn home invasion thriller but turns into a crime thriller about half way in and is better for it. The usual Jim Haggerty traits (that I notice anyway) are here, nudity with girls you usually don't see naked (small boobs, average rears) but should. The odd couplings (fat guy pretty girl) and the incidental scenes.

This is not as good as Is This a Joke but it is the best Haggerty thriller I have seen. The actor playing the husband is quite good as are some of the supporting players. The fight scenes need work and one should fast forward thru the opening title song (it is the scariest thing in the picture), but all in all, I liked the true crime elements and low budget feel here.",1326499200,6,727,4.385185185185185

8493304,2,B00656Z0B2,"My friend said it was a good movie and it ad some potential but the acting was just horrible. This is a movie that i would grade a maybe not a F because it showed it had potential to be a good movie, but a d- because it didn't show that potential.",1362355200,,247,3.769230769230769
8493305,1,B00656Z0B2,"I have this rented for the next seven days, wish I could end my rental now. The actors must have been in their first week of acting school and flunked out. they were making up their lines no joke. Line: I am not getting paid to think, I am getting paid to be a detective. Was not ment to be a joke.",1357430400,2,298,3.8225806451612905
8493306,1,B00656Z0B2,"This doesn't even deserve one star... it's that bad.  The acting must be done by people who have never even taken an acting class.  Whoever directed/produced should probably find another career.  What I saw of the story was stupid, but I had to quit watching it because it was that ridiculous.  I never review movies even if they're not good but this one is really, really dumb.  Plus I felt like, since I want my own money back, maybe I could save someone else from wasting their money on this.",1356825600,,495,4.455555555555556
8493307,1,B00656Z0B2,movie was very low budget.silly plot.not very good acting.i give this movie a 1 star.i would give it a zero if there was one.,1346889600,3,125,4.25
8493308,1,B00656Z0B2,"This was by far the worst movie all around that I have watched in as long as I can remember. I am a HUGE fan of B movies and have sat through just about every Troma film ever made (kind of sad)...that being said those Troma films have Meryl Streep, Al Pacino caliber acting compaired to this rubbish but that can be overlooked because who rents this type of movie for the acting...the story line is terrible...I was looking for a Kidnapped or even Funny Games style movie but this was just blah...in a film you expect to see blood and guts and nudity this movie scores ZERO..maybe a 1 on nudity because in the begining they show some boobs...Save your $2.99 because this one I would be upset if it cost me .25 and I am serious!!",1339632000,2,728,4.282608695652174
8493309,1,B00656Z0B2,"I don't know who gave high rating for this crap, maybe producer friends?!? Keep your money. Except two minutes near the end this is a very cheap movie.",1333584000,2,151,4.428571428571429
8493310,5,B00656Z0B2,"Jim Haggerty's From the Inside is arguably the writer-director's best film and a very thrilling and entertaining experience.  Reportedly filmed prior to a few of his more recent releases but held up in post-production, From The Inside features strong work from an excellent ensemble cast and never fails to keep the viewer guessing as to which twists and turns will next occur.  I will not say much about the plot in this review as I do not wish to reveal any spoilers- suffice it to say that murder, deception, and sex are prominently featured, and the ending is tremendously shocking.  From the Inside is an exploration of the darker sides of human motivation and behavior and allows the viewer to make his or her own decisions about which characters (if any) to root for as the events unfold.  Jim Haggerty makes the most of an obviously limited budget, which, as a character and plot-driven vehicle, really does not ultimately harm the entertainment value of From The Inside, and helps further establish Haggerty as a meaningful voice in independent filmmaking.  Highly recommended!",1330819200,6,1086,4.9779005524861875
8493311,4,B00656Z0B2,"From the Inside is a film that is filled with suspense.  If you like thrillers and suspense, you will enjoy this one.  It is one of Jim Haggerty's best films.  The plot leaves you on the edge of your seat with anticipation.  Definitely worth checking out and not at all predictable.",1330732800,7,282,4.470588235294118
