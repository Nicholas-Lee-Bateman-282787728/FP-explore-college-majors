8051851,1,B0007U1Y8K,"All money from these products goes to the Children of God cult, now known as the Family International. This cult was founded by David Berg, a known pedophile, and since his death has been run by his wife Karen Zerby, another pedophile. The Family has always been defined by its horrific child abuse and forced child labor, as myself and thousands of other survivors who were born into this group can attest to. Don't support cults or child abuse. Do not buy these videos.",1457222400,,471,4.619047619047619
8051852,1,B0007U1Y8K,"Created by members of the family international (cog, children of god, the family of love) which is a pseudo christian sex cult with a background of child abuse, religious prostitution, brainwashing and much much more. Most people (like me) raised in this group grew up with this stuff and would tell anyone to just don't expose your kids to anything to do with this group. Also don't' sent them money by buying stuff from them.
Here's a bit about them:[...]",1457222400,,457,4.725
8051853,1,B0007U1Y8K,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product it supports well documented pedophiles.",1456704000,2,814,4.9416058394160585

8051855,5,B0007U1Y8K,"Can Jesus call kids?

 Follow the leader deals with Jesus calling us to follow Him.  Not for pastors, priests and nuns, but for kids - like yours and mine, who live in an everyday world -- today.  When I was a little boy, I really wanted to be called by Jesus, thanks to my dear mother, who taught me to love Him.  But I was taught, sometimes directly, other times just in the way things were presented, that the calling of God in people's lives, especially children, was only something that happened long ago.  It didn't seem to work the same today.  This story turns that idea around, and encourages the kids that God can and wants to use them!

  In Cherub Wings style, it's fun --even fascinating--, but it packs a message that's worth a lot.  It touches lightly, but it develops the idea that Jesus has a plan for each one of us, and that if we are open to that plan, and want to know what it is, He will lead us in it, even if we're only kids.

 As with the others I've seen in the Cherub Wings series (I haven't seen all of them), Follow the Leader is a strong Christian message, but it's not denominational or doctrinal.  That is to say, it seems to be made to be acceptable by most all Christians, without causing disputes over controversial doctrines.  It seems to be aimed at the grade school aged kids, but it's going to be hard for others in the family to leave the room while it's on.  The cartoon graphics are very simple, but somehow they are very appealing to young and old.",1166400000,4,1491,4.271428571428571
