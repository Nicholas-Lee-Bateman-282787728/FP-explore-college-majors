8444605,5,B004W7D21G,"Christmas 1964 I got a silvertone guitar/amp combo as a gift. it came with a play-along record and book. I learned to play bass and it was great. this is a modern version, but is great too. a fantastic way to learn guitar or bass. I am Bessie's son dennis and at 62 years old and I still remember every song and the enjoyment of learning. dennis",1414022400,3,345,4.164179104477612

8444607,5,B004W7D21G,this is a very detailed and accurate video. It'll take some work but the songs sound great and are accessible. There are no TABS but you can rewind and make your own. I find that that is actually a better way to learn. It takes longer initially but the material gets stuck in your head better. If that makes any sense. lol  Rock on!,1391904000,4,332,4.1875
