1039471,4,6305499608,"Myles is a creedy dude.  Narcistic beyond all belief, he seems to want to achieve all the things that elude him most.  The problem is that his various attempts at achieving the goals are misguided. He seems to be  always be saying: ""I deserve this, so why can't I get it?""  His  cameras and his life style invite comparision to Patrick Bateman from  AMERICAN PSYCHO.  Then again, he is sort of an every man.  His intentions  are honorable, but his execution is flawed.
Then again, this is the  ""Myles"" character that is being documented on film.  I think that  this is just an off-spring of Myles Berkowitz, the filmmaker.  The  ""Myles"" character is really just a composite sketch of all  Berkowitz's worst personality flaws.  This movie is a way for him to disect  himself.  That is probably why he has all of his friends and his agent in  the movie.  They list off all of his worst characteristics.  Surely, they  must have mentioned some good ones.  Berkowitz just decided not to include  them.  Berkowtiz is similar to Woody Allen.  The ""Woody""  character that you see in all of his movies is not Woody Allen.  He is just  a public personae to air the real Allen's dirty laundry.  Film making is a  cathartic release.
With that being said, I like this movie a lot.  There  are some things that are obviously staged.  I think that it is a pretty  good bet that the producer of the film is a fictional creation.  The ending  of the film, which is its one weak spot, is also staged.  The rest of it  simply seems to real to be staged.  Look at the footage of Berkowitz's  ex-wife.  Or ths reaction of the women when they find out they are being  filmed.  It's eithier phenomonal acting, or it's honest to God ""Candid  Camera"" stuff.  I think what I like most about it is the  uncomprimising honest.  He goes to AA meetings to meet women.  He uses  sleazy pick up lines (""Do you want porno movies?"" he asks  Elisabeth.)  He even films himself freaking out on his crew.  And I love  that the fact that he blew his one shot at fame because he couldn't star or  direct.  Berkowitz knows he looks like a jerk, but he doesn't care.  It is  all for the sake of the movie.
The real achievement of this movie is that  you root for ""Myles,"" regardless of his flaws.  He only wants  what we all want.  You can't blame the guy for trying.",964224000,7,2327,4.382422802850356
1039472,1,6305499608,"This is one of the most unpleasant (pseudo?)documentaries i've ever seen. Myles Berkowitz is truly obnoxious and the only feelings this movie inspired were ones of  sympathy for the women who suffer his company. The  constant  whining about the paltry $60,000 budget and the difficulties of  breaking into Hollywood really start to irritate. It's enough of an  injustice that someone invested more than $600 in Berkowitz's project.  Successful independent films are inventive with artistic merit, but this is  no more than self-conscious bitching and moaning by a Hollywood reject.  Here's a good rule: low-budget films by Hollywood wannabes make for  terrible viewing. Berkowitz seems to fancy himself a Woody Allenesque  personality, but he's neither witty, humorous, articulate or intelligent.  I'm surprised he has any friends.",964137600,6,831,5.568
1039473,1,6305499608,"This is like watching someone's bad home movies. Actually, it IS watching someone's bad home movies. Myles Berkowitz is the most irritating character I've seen in ages. The movie is supposed to be a comic documentary about  relationships, but keep these two things in mind--it's not funny, and all  of the ""real"" scenes seem staged (badly). Particularly irritating  here is the use of snippets from (some) classic movies. Myles comes off  like one of those quick! grabtheremotecontrol late-night TV motivational  speakers. One of the year's worst, no matter what year you see it.",960163200,4,579,5.182795698924731
1039474,5,6305499608,"I disagree with those reviewers for find all of this fake and scripted.  Obviously the last parts are.  But that is because Myles realized that he found true love.  This movie captures a divorced man's journey to find  himself both in the career and love markets.  Myles basically details the  different trials and tribulations he faced in making this movie with a nice  touch of wit thrown in.  The viewer really gets to know different sides to  Myles, both good and bad.  Yes, there are some difficult sides to Myles'  personality which strongly show in his scathing comments towards  Elizabeth's original unavailability. However, if Myles were Mr Goody Two  Shoes, would this be reality?  I doubt it.  None the less for a low budget  film, this flick sure seems like a winner to me.",956966400,3,785,4.746268656716418
1039475,1,6305499608,"Berkowitz loses our trust early in the film and never regains it. Immediately you realize that this movie is staged and what results is just bad writing and bad acting. On his dates Berkowitz nevers says anything  charming or intersteing.  On one date,  one woman is offended to learn  she's being photographed with a hidden camera.  She wounds Berkowitz's hand  which he says required stitches. We never seen the hand wound or the  stitches.  Each date is so fabricated and staged. I felt insulted and  cheated. He must think his audience is stupid to think that these dates are  real.",956880000,6,586,4.77
1039476,3,6305499608,"First of all....I liked it. Now this does not mean that you will necessarily like it, but if you are willing to take the film at ""face"" value, you will enjoy it. Myles Berkowitz directs and  stars in this film which is apparently his first attempt at making a major  movie. Think back a few years to the movie ""Clerks"", some young  filmakers trying their hand in the business. This film does the same, but  plays upon the audience to figure out if it is really a true story or a  made-up one to resemble a true story. Here is Myles making a movie about  love and in order to make the movie real, he decides to film himself going  on 20 dates. As we all know (okay maybe not all of us), but we have heard  that while not all dates go well, some of them are totally hilarious. So in  this film, you will see some pretty hilarious ones and some totally boring  ones....but that's the realness of the movie. I would suggest that you take  a chance and see the film....if you don't like it, well you at least  experienced something new in the movies. Bottom line...take a date to the  movie and try and figure out which one of the 20 dates best matches the one  you are currently on.",950400000,,1178,4.200892857142857
1039477,5,6305499608,"I heard about this movie on a review show and had to go see it. I heard some lines from it and thought it was funny. Since it was a low-budget art film, of which I'm not particular fan, I went into the movie with some  trepidation. I was quite surprised. Myles Berkowitz fills this movie with a  great deal of self-deprecating mockery. I found it difficult to tell which  parts were scripted and which parts were not, and truthfully that is a good  sign of a well-made pseudodocumentary.  One of the funniest characters  in the film is Berkowitz's film school mentor. The viewers just have the  sense that the character believes in what he says. Berkowitz's attempts to  attract women at any cost, including pimping his own nephew, are  hilarious. The whole scene really illustrates what we guys would stoop to in  order to pick-up women.  Berkowitz's insights into financing and selling  his idea of the movie are entertaining and enlightening because they really  delve into the workings of Hollywood.  I would highly recommend this  movie. It also happens to be a great date movie because of its romantic  overtones. A must-see.",946080000,7,1131,4.782383419689119
1039478,5,6305499608,"Staged or not, (I did not get the impression that it was) I think this movie is hysterical. Above that I think it really addresses some of the real issues between men and women. The film also shows how hard it is to  make a movie in hollywood and still stay true to your art or concept. The  movie also has the interesting side effect of being somewhat romantic. I  feel that Berkowitz has worked hard to make his first movie a hit, and in  my opinion has had success.",940118400,5,468,4.166666666666667
1039591,2,6305499608,"This is a fun movie, reflecting on the trials of dating in the modern age. The focus is Los Angeles but the same holds true in any relatively large metro area.

1039593,1,6305499608,"There's something terribly wrong with a movie that is centered on a charm-free guy who doesn't have a single interesting thing to say.

1039594,2,6305499608,"If Myles Berkowitz could just find a women that walked like him, talked like him, looked like him, whined like him... well you get the point. 20 Dates is like a longer version of ""Blind Date"" only not half as funny. Instead we are forced to hear Myles spew on about his notions of Hollywood romance. What would have made a better movie was to try and explain how a women like Elizabeth would ever go out with someone as myopic as Myles, then maybe some men would have actually learned something about women A.K.A. love. I gave it 2 stars because the producer lines while probably scripted made me laugh, and I actually made it to the end of the film.

1039598,5,6305499608,"Difficult to comprehend the level of fear/loathing directed at this wonderfully funny/fair & finally sweet winking quasi-documentary. Except by guessing that regular respectable adults do NOT feel AT ALL comfortable with transparent infotainment about how narrative concoctions of any sort happen? 20 DATES is lively humor, NOT regular deadly professional [t]wittiness, because Berkowitz refuses to ALWAYS spend time/effort falsifying for market. Yes there IS a bit of writing behind the game, sufficient semi-innocent schtick to remove the movie from the realm of abject natural disorder, but there is NO extended effort to fool anyone, either any young woman who felt victimized by the plot or any reasonably alert gentle viewer. In fact, since GENUINE invasions of privacy are mild/gentle, revealed quickly/straightly in real/mocktime, & will require subject/victim release, basis for audience taking offense is peculiar, may reveal much more about prim, or falsely dignified, audience than about Myles Berkowitz? Target of most of the comic barbs is Myles himself, naturally, & he DOES deserve his insults. Some of the dates get their fair share too, equally naturally, but a very nice paradox operates. Women who feel/express violation straightly, particularly the first date Berkowitz truly likes, appear very beautiful on screen, are allowed to shine, graciously thanked for being who they are in the only way artists can thank contributing live models. This scene is more moving than hundreds of professionally acted/affected imitations of the irritation most of us feel when closely parsed, unexpectedly exposed. Do we WANT anything this close to recognizable truth from a movie? Apparently not, though we accept/support more obviously overcooked/exaggerated/feigned hyper-reality without blinking? How do we normally respond if/when art neglects to pretend at the expected level of slick/glitzy escapism? Do we wish to be engaged, intellectually or emotionally? Or left alone?
20 DATES is certainly unusual in concept, but not unprecedented. Henry Jaglom's interesting, if more peculiar/abrasive (harder to LIKE), SOMEBODY TO LOVE, same primary subject/method, features Orson Welles, rather than Robert McKee, doing voice of cinema/romance wisdom duty. Welles is more deeply charming than McKee (or, when Orson wished to charm, anyone else in the world?), but Jaglom operates more heavily than Berkowitz. A late, if not final, Welles appearance, recommended to curious humans who witnessed too much of Welles the wine-shill.
Closing bows to Tia Carrere & Elie Samaha for appearing, plus executive producing. Given the state of the commercial marketplace for movies, every honest funny eccentricity helps?",993427200,7,2714,5.703703703703703
1039599,4,6305499608,"A comic love story documentary that worked out wonderfully by chance.  Berkowitz is random, hilarious and extremely creative.

Myles played himself as a typical good-looking, shallow, and self-adsorbed male looking for love. During his 20 dates, the women are just as shallow and self-adsorbed as he is, which makes for a lot of fun. But he really exposes is not only how shallow we are as modern humans, but also that romantic love is basically an illusion.

In order to re-watch this little known movie about a guy finding love on 20 real or fake dates mock-documentary movie. It took awhile to find the right movie title, i would of name the movie ""21 dates"" cause it would easier to remember then 20 dates (Blackjack).  Overall, i felt refresh with my online purchase for the movie, cause their was some value points about Love made within the movie about and finding love.  So if, u are of age and it's your birthday and still having found love to be in love, watch this mildly entertaining movie about a schmuck trying to find love without looking so much a jerk.",1290384000,,784,4.326530612244898
7890594,4,6305499608,"I adore everything about this film. I think it's pretty obvious that this film is not the 'documentary' it pretends to be, although I really wish it was. I personally don't believe it's likely to fall in true love with someone, knowing you are on camera; but hey, it is Hollywood.

Myles Berkowitz is a divorced, self-centered director/actor who makes a lot of bad decisions and can't keep his big mouth shut. He's decided to go on just 20 dates to chronicle trying to find love in Los Angeles, and attempt to find real people falling in true love.

Myles is incredibly annoying, and everything he does tells me he isn't looking for love(from his rude physical comments to disrespect for just about everyone), but that's why I adore it so much. Myles is every single one of us who thinks we are something we're not, or maybe it's just that we're just not ready for love, or we don't even know what love is. Purposely picking up on unsuspecting women in grocery stores, or even while they are at work; this guy is every man who tries to lay on a slick line that makes you cringe, until they finally leave you alone; and yet still, this man thinks he's looking for love.

My favorite parts of this film are with Robert McKee and Myles; discussing the brilliance of Casablanca to the very poignant facts about woman versus men and what we really want. They are great moments that bring a smile to my face with their sheer honesty and insightfulness.

I really wish this film would have ended at the first ending, instead of the ever so happy one, but it is a heartwarming, somewhat enlightening film I honestly enjoy.

But really Myles, try a little harder? I'd love to have just a little more faith in men.",1221868800,3,1704,4.483870967741935

He was boring, hideously dressed (wearing a plaid shirt and dorky jeans in L.A??? to supposedly meet the woma of his dreams).
