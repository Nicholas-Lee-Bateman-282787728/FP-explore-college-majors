8179590,4,B000NO1ZC0,"This shortish DVD was a delight for both adults and children. It not only tells a heart warming tale  but does so with beautiful painted animation in the style of Monet.  It's a visual treat. Children aged 3 to 9 have loved it and requested it again and again. After watching it, a four year old pointed out a painting in the art gallery as one by 'Mr Monet'. She was right.",1260316800,,374,4.180555555555555

I loved seeing Monet's paintings come to life and even jump off the screen!  It truly was a feast for the imagination and eyes!  It also teaches children great values of sharing with others and also caring for the life which grows around them!",1257379200,,604,9.39655172413793
