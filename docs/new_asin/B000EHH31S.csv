Most of the training shows adults ""swishing"" the baby around a bathtub or wading pool. Then, as if by magic, they show a toddler (est. 1-2 yrs.) who is thrown into the pool with clothes and shoes, and calmly recovers, and turns to float on her back. There are no instructions to show how this is accomplished.

Also, she recommends children use cheap vinyl float tubes to be safe in water play. Such tubes are very easy to puncture, hard to hold on to (slippery) and have no place where water safety is a priority. It's hard to believe a water-savvy person such as Esther didn't have any critical input as to how bad this video is. To see a 4 minute summary of the ""5 steps"" go to YouTube and search for ""Swim Baby, Swim WRONG.""",1409529600,,819,4.352941176470588
8109707,5,B000EHH31S,"First of all I am a devoted fan of Esther Williams.  I bought this to have another of her movies and after seeing it realized how informative and important a movie it was.  I can't swim so I am especially fond of this for new parents to begin the swimming experience for their babies soon after birth.  It's amazing.  Especially for new mother's and daddy's this is a must see movie presented by the beautiful, knowledgeable, and talented Esther Williams.",1374019200,,455,4.65
