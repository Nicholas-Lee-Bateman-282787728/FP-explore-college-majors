8273488,4,B0019CUM0G,"to say this 'film' is revoked of splendour would be 'comparing' marshmallows to fruitloops. haven't we done more for the 'cause' than these three be tens, I implore you. when I read the autobiography of Malcolm x I knew right then what it was. okay. this is a bit more elaborate; but by whose standard.
as public enemy always remained the progenitors of the 'cause', let's keep it knockin'....",1503273600,,393,4.7101449275362315
8273489,2,B0019CUM0G,No were near what was advertised.  Only provided were a few video clips.  Very disappointing!!,1444608000,,94,5.2
8273490,1,B0019CUM0G,I did not like this DVD movie because of the sound was terrible and the pictures were not clear fuzzy picture I recommend not to buy this DVD movie.,1435104000,,148,4.137931034482759
8273491,1,B0019CUM0G,Terrible....I was only able to view about 10 mins of DVD after that it froze up and wouldn't play.  Disappointed,1392940800,,112,4.6
8273492,5,B0019CUM0G,"Malcolm X was a patriot and humanitarian disguised as an angry man.

When things are wrong in the land people need to speak out. Malcolm spoke and prayed and spoke some more.

Being white I wanted to understand where he was coming from and in the end he
came from his heart with love for all of us.",1330992000,2,298,4.120689655172414
8273493,1,B0019CUM0G,"This is an awful video.  The voices are nowhere close to matching the lips.  The beginning of the film is interspersed with old movie clips containing African American actors, and this seriously detracts from the actual file footage of the video.  It appears that people with little or no technical background in putting videos together worked on this project.  I'd advise looking elsewhere for footage of Malcolm X.  This video is amateurish and not worth the money.",1293753600,9,467,5.012987012987013
8273494,3,B0019CUM0G,"When I received this DVD I was excited to listen to rare Malcolm X speeches, but I was a little disappointed at the use of excerpts from Jim Crow commercials and clips of ""Uncle Tom"" TV shows that were prevalent during this era.
I also would have liked to see more footage,
This could have been edited and produced much better, but overall I was engaged by the wit and conviction of the speeches and interviews that Malcolm gave in this DVD, However, I think a lot of speeches were missing and I was left wanting..",1242259200,16,514,4.364583333333333
8273495,1,B0019CUM0G,"The video and audio of this recording are so poor that it would be impossible to watch this DVD for more than a few seconds.  The opening black and white video footage was poorly copied from a possibly damaged tape source, so there is a bluish tinge in a spiral pattern that creates an almost psychedelic visual effect.  This caused a headache for me, and I'm convinced it would do the same for other viewers. The last recording on the film has the audio so totally out of sync with the video that it's impossible to tolerate watching it.  This is most unfortunate, because the content of the speeches are worth hearing, but not through this production.",1225324800,22,653,4.564102564102564
