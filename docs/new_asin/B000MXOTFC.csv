8173501,2,B000MXOTFC,I like independent films but this one had bad acting and the camera movements seemed to be very armature.  I personally did not like the movie and though that it had potential but it was not realized.,1372204800,,200,4.405405405405405
8173502,1,B000MXOTFC,"This was the worst picture I've ever seen, I'm not even gonna call it a movie because it wasn't. I really don't know what to call it, they haven't invented words in the dictionary yet to describe how terrible this picture was. About 5mins into the picture I was wondering how I could get my $1.99 back, now I wish I could've bought that one sock and AAA battery that crackhead tried to sell me earlier for $2 then pay to see this, wow..what a waste of time and money..that's 1hr & 15mins I gonna wish I had back when it's my time to leave this earth but I can't have it back because I wasted it on this crap! I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO GOD FOR WASTING THE PRECIOUS TIME HE'D GIVING ME AND I USED 1HR AND 15MINS OF IT TO WATCH THAT PIECE OF CRAP...(I'M SORRY LORD!). I wish Amazon had another rating symbol in front of the first star for the pictures that don't even deserve a one star rating.",1327968000,2,894,4.114285714285714
8173503,1,B000MXOTFC,"This was shot in some brother's house on a $2 camera! STOP, don't buy it!",1227484800,,73,3.933333333333333
8173504,3,B000MXOTFC,"Bi Chance is a decent movie, but with better editing the film could have been taken more seriously. The acting is okay, but with the subject matter I expected more. The comedy in the film drowns the real drama.",1207094400,,210,4.410256410256411
8173505,1,B000MXOTFC,"This movie was sooo bad, I stopped watching it after the first 30 mins. I mean some of the ladies are beautiful, but this is the worst low budget film I ever seen. Its more like low budget porn than anything. It could have been a better film if the story line was produced better and focused less on the man having sex w/ his woman. The way the film is structured, you would have thought that the man was bisexual himself. Just do yourself a favor and DON'T Buy This FILM!!!",1199577600,6,474,4.163043478260869
8173506,1,B000MXOTFC,All I can say is don't EVER buy this product.  I have never in my life seen such unproffessional work.  They should be apprehended for producing and selling such a low-budget product.  I would be asshamed to even have my name mensioned in the credits.,1198022400,3,251,4.533333333333333
