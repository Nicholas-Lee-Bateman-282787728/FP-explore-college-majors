8363593,4,B002C8NPM8,"I found this in the discount bin at a local store for $3.00 or so. At the time, I was looking for views of what it's like on the ground in Africa, so the ""African Savannah"" episode caught my attention. I got a fair sense of the landscape, and found the whole DVD to be fairly entertaining, so I wasn't disappointed.

The host is marginally charismatic, and seems to more or less know what he's talking about, but I have to say that some of the things he did in the name of survival were confusing at best. He scavenged a dead deer in Siberia, for instance, and decided that the leg would make a better walking stick than any of the actual sticks in the forest in which he was standing. It could be that there was a really good explanation for the choice, but none was given so I'm still slightly mystified by it. There were other things like that, but far more prevalent were demonstrations that seemed to have been staged for purposes that were more dramatic than instructive. Drinking liquid wrung from a pile of elephant manure, and a fair amount of theatrical bug eating come to mind. Bear is clearly an adrenaline junkie, possibly with a touch of attention deficit disorder, and reminds me of a somewhat less outdoorsy Steve Irwin.

I don't pretend to be any sort of survival expert, but I do spend a fair amount of time running around outdoors and I can say that I absolutely would not do 75% of the stuff that Bear did in these videos. The useful things that he did were often de-emphasized in favor of the Fear Factor stuff. That notwithstanding, it was fun to watch and pretty good TV in the end.",1335225600,3,1605,4.382550335570469
