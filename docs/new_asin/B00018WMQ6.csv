8007949,5,B00018WMQ6,"Seems like everyone has the names of Sanzo and his party of pilgrim/adventurers inscribed on their weapons of choice.  Carrying ascripture around in this alternate Chinese world is risky business.  The priest, Goku, Gojyo and Hakkai don't need any help to get into trouble though, but they are getting much more than they ever bargained for.
It seems that the god Homura's decision to rebel and gather the scriptures for himself has attracted some followers.  First Souto, head of a group of crack divine shock troops gets the assignment to take Sanzo down.  A little later, Homura and his own sidekicks, Zenon and Shien show up to demonstrate that Sanzo and Goku are completely outclassed in this contest.  As usual, the monk pulls through, but not without serious damage.
While all this is going on there are two visits from season one - first a pair of twins in the service of Gyokumen Koushu show up with utter destruction on their mind - and then the idiot impersonators show up again for a short sojourn into the more violent forms of comedy.  Somehow, our heroes keep up their attitude and return to each conflict determined to survive.
Production quality seems to have improved an order of magnitude since the last season.  In the previous DVD I wasn't sure whether to believe it or not, but with this second one it is clear that the show has iimproved, both in art and writing.  In the middle of all the action, the group finds time to develop as characters, and both animation and color have increased in intensity.
This series is a bit past the point where one can pick it up mainstream.  This isn't a bad thing from a watcher's point of view, but be prepared for a sudden urge to empty your wallet for the series.",1081555200,4,1725,4.611111111111111
