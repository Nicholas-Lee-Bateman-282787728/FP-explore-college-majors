8150259,1,B000JFXTA4,Only watched the one dvd which is effectively a bunch of no talent mean spirited journalists that seem to think their opinions matter. I will be returning it and do not recommend it. It was a gift for a major Queen fan and it was hugely disappointing for him.,1389916800,,259,4.3061224489795915
8150260,5,B000JFXTA4,"What else can be said about Freddie and Queen that has not already been written.  For those who enjoy concert videos, you will find yourself watching this over and over.  Sound quality is reasonable, video is not what you would expect today with complex cameras and placement, but this holds up well.  Above all, the music, and the talent of this band shines throughout.",1329436800,3,370,4.75
8150261,5,B000JFXTA4,"Who doesn't love Queen?  Who doesn't still mourn the early demise of Freddy Mercury?  Even the youth of today know who Queen is, their songs and love them.  Buy this and you'll see why and remember fond memories.",1259625600,5,212,4.526315789473684
8150262,2,B000JFXTA4,"I thought the Queen interviews and performances were great.  I got alot of background information that I didn't know before,making my appreciation of the performances greater.

One DVD however, didn't play at all.  The title screen said it can;t play.

I guess it gets a 50 overall.  One disc is great...one disc won't play.",1209427200,3,324,4.925925925925926
8150263,1,B000JFXTA4,What a waste of time to watch. Just a bunch of critics saying what they think of songs..hardly any Queen footage or interviews.  I returned it!!  Buy the videos of their music....it's much more entertaining.,1192665600,36,207,4.885714285714286
8150264,1,B000JFXTA4,"I wish I had known that this was just re-packaging of two titles I already have.  I wish that Brian May and Roger Taylor would sit down with a really skilled journalist and talk honestly about Queen.  There are so many myths about them, yet I can understand why they protect themselves and their families.  I love their music and I think it has survived the test of time very well.  I guess that has to be enough for now......",1191456000,26,426,4.2875
8150265,1,B000JFXTA4,"This ""collection"" is two previously released DVDs which I already own. Description should state what those titles are. If you already own ""Magic Moments"" and ""Under Review:1973-1980""- don't bother.",1190160000,54,197,5.827586206896552
