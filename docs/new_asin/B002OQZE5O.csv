3963210,4,B002OQZE5O,"Do you like 'horror'/'thriller' type movies?  Then do not miss out on this film!

I stumbled upon this movie and was so pleased.  The acting is excellent.  The camera-work is consistent with what would be expected given that much is filmed from a first-person point-of-view.

This film is very creepy... beware, the film's main characters are 2 kids.  Let's just say that if I had kids of this age bracket, I would probably have slept with my bedroom door locked after watching this movie.

The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  You are always waiting and anticipating.  The tension is built up early in the film and continues to maintain it's strength until the very end.",1337299200,5,685,4.641666666666667
3963211,4,B002OQZE5O,"Adrian Pasdar and spouse must deal with their two kids, whose actions are increasingly cruel and bizarre. The worst thing is that they are isolated. Also, they live in denial about just how bad the problem is.  Had these kids been sent into custody and treatment, maybe they wouldn't have....oh, I won't spoil it.  Rent it and be freaked out!",1325548800,,342,4.683333333333334
3963212,5,B002OQZE5O,"This is one of the new modern 2011 horror movies that is reality based.  I could not stop watching it, even though it was slow in parts, still an edge of your seat movie.  Better than Paranormal Activity 2 and the Last Exorcism, but on the same page.

Adrian Padsar is excellent in this movie, the kids are good, the wife the same.  All believable home movie charactures with a very scary situation going on at home.  I highly recommend.",1313020800,3,437,4.4125
3963213,4,B002OQZE5O,"This is a well-written thriller done on a low budget. It uses the same kind of hand-held, literal home-movie style that made the more recent movie ""Paranormal Activity"" a hit. This 2008 film has now unfortunately often been relegated to remainder shelves. But it deserves to be brought up front and center again. It's ominous and intelligent.

It shows how the hyper-active, desperate attempts of a couple to recreate the picture-perfect family turn horribly against them. Their children are twins, although not the usual identical twins that we've come to expect in horror films. Here we have a little boy and girl who have carried over their womb alliance into the larger world. Their closeness seems to have engendered a strange indifference in them, a propensity for cruelty to all things not them.

The blood-bonded twosome find the evil obverse to every ""wholesome"" activity their parents propose. Their father tries to interest them in playing baseball; they find another use for a baseball bat. Their parents don Halloween and Easter costumes and cavort; they assume diabolical masks to make them scarily impenetrable, impersonal. The father reads them bedtime stories; they take that as impetus to start to turn into fairytale monsters themselves.

The script ties up all the noose-loose ends - and the picture ends on just the right turn-about-is-fair-play image, with maximum macabre effect.",1294358400,2,1402,5.222222222222222
3963214,1,B002OQZE5O,"I bought this junk.  This movie goes on and on.  The kids are freaks but WE as the viewer will never know why.  There is some gore, but forget about seeing any.  There is a quick shot of the crucified cat... mom and dad are drugged... but again, why???  The best part of the movie was the end.  Only because it was over!",1265587200,7,320,4.0
3963215,3,B002OQZE5O,"For an indie film it's ok.
I have two qualms about the movie:
1.) The pacing of the movie should have been a bit faster, although I understand it's a ""Home Movie"", but some parts were dragging when it should have picked up.
and
2.) One thing that I did not like is the lack of background of the two children.  The viewer should have been given more insight to their upbringing.
Overall the movie is creepy during some of the scenes regarding some of the activities the children do to some of the animals.
Enjoy!!",1260489600,,512,4.333333333333333

3963217,5,B002OQZE5O,"Right up front, I have to say this was one of the creepiest (and awesome) found footage movies I've ever seen.

I'm a big fan of ""creepy children/bad seed"" horror, and FF, so to find this one on a few people's ""all time favorite"" FF lists over the last couple weeks prompted me to borrow a friend's copy on DVD (unfortunately, they don't seem to carry it on Amazon Instant or Netflix).  I'd never heard of this one, prior to stumbling across the lists on IMDB and elsewhere, so I was a both really stoked to see the largely positive reviews, and equally surprised, after a few years of digging for good FF movies, that I'd honestly not heard of it.

Home Movie tells the slowly but steadily evolving tale of two seemingly excellent parents (I though Dad was particularly fun as a parent), with two children who, from the outset, are definitely a little...off. That being said, I have to say here that, as the mom is Chief Resident in child psychology of an area hospital, I struggled with reconciling why and how she seemed to not notice or comment to the kids, or privately with dad, about why the kids were behaving like two mysterious, evil robots - this didn't seem to register with the good doctor for the first half of the film, though it's her specialty. Anyway, I had to point that out up front. I can't say more without giving away too much, so I'll just leave it at that...

As the home movies continue, and the odd behavior along with it, the parents struggle to understand why their children are getting progressively more distant and their actions more and more disturbing...then horrific.

Suffice to say, watching the slow deterioration of the family, driven by the children's frightening actions (and their inaction, in places) provided one of the creepiest found footage experiences I've yet come across. I definitely recommend this one, no question - and especially if you enjoy ""bad seed"" horror and the found footage genre.",1426982400,,1943,4.669590643274854
3963218,4,B002OQZE5O,"I really hate that they used ""found footage"" for this movie. But that being said, it's not a bad horror movie. Especially if you like creepy kids.",1418601600,,146,4.444444444444445
3963219,4,B002OQZE5O,"Being a movie buff I go on film binges,like a while back I was on a Denzell Washington binge,(cant go wrong there),then a 3D blu ray binge. Lately its been a found footage binge and I've enjoyed the trip!! A few real good ones(The Bay,The Frankenstein Theory,and many more)and a LOT of duds. Home Movie is a good one!!! While I never heard of it,one day I was googling top 50 good foundfootage movies and I've slowly been trying to see them all. Home Movie was on the list and it didn't disappoint!! The Poe family has a new video recorder back in the day and like a lot of us with our 1st one,they record everything. Hence the title..Home Movie. What s l o w l y starts taking place is a mental deteriation of the 2 kids. A real descent into madness kinda movie ..all caught on film. This movies finale was one that will make a person curse!!! I'll just say..WOW!!! A good movie for found footage buffs.",1411171200,2,904,4.292397660818714
3963220,5,B002OQZE5O,"Oooh. Ah, man. How do I find the words for this one. Every time I watch it I realize more how brilliant it is. The first time around I was so caught up in the moment-to-moment of it that I didn't even realize some of the key facts, like that the kids basically NEVER EVEN SPEAK through the whole first part of the movie, and that, with one fateful exception, no cast members besides the family of pastor dad, child-psychiatrist mom, and deeply screwed-up fraternal twins Jack and Emily. The reason I didn't notice was because the actors are so damn engaging.
It opens on a Halloween dinner. Father David (Adrian Pastar) and mom Clare (Cady McClain, proving she can rise way above the world of daytime soaps) are so ebullient and engaging that I almost wished they were my parents, except there's just something a little forced in it all. Slowly, so slowly the movie dissects their characters, uncovers their weaknesses. Are they bad parents? Are they bad people? Keep asking yourselves that question as you watch the movie and you'll keep coming up with different answers, and that's part of what makes it not just a horror movie, but a DAMN FINE WORK OF ART!!! Writer and director Christopher Denham is definitely saying something here, something deep and important. What is he saying? I'm not sure. I'm not certain that Denham even knows, and he doesn't have to any more than a great chef needs to be able to put into words what she was thinking and feeling as she whipped up some once-in-a-lifetime feast. The elements brought into play here, faith, science, our attitudes toward marriage, our attitude toward children, our strategies for coping with stressful situations, child abuse, self-hate, clinical hubris (damn I'm a good writer), they're all there, and none of it is faked.
For crying out loud, just WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! IT ROCKS!!!",1407801600,5,1843,4.780564263322884

3963222,5,B002OQZE5O,"But to get under your skin and wreck your nerves. And this one succeeds.

While Mom and Dad are happy in love and being parents, the kids are obviously seriously disturbed. In fact, they don't speak until about half way through the movie.

Mom and Dad try to act like everything is A-Ok, but the movie carries a heavy, doom-is-on-the-horizon feel to it. Like, there is a hand raised wating for the right moment to slap. And slap it does.

All the actors involved gave excellent, convincing performances.

And for being a camcorder movie, the shaking and video disturbance of the usual found footage type movies if, for the most part, missing here. You can focus more of the story and actors instead of trying to figure out what you were supposed to be looking at or what direction the shot is.

This movie will haunt and UN-nerve you. Which is what true horror is supposed to do!",1391385600,4,879,4.537974683544304

3963225,5,B002OQZE5O,"Very well made, very scary and well played by the actors involved.  If I had 10 year old kids after watching this they would probally be strapped to their beds while I sleep ROFL.  Worth the money, will watch again.",1349827200,2,215,4.35
8376348,1,B002OQZE5O,This is probably one of the weirdest and boring movies Ive ever seen.

8376357,1,B002OQZE5O,"The scariest horror movies are the ones that feature a story that can actually happen, and what's more terrifying than psychotic children? Like adults, kids can absolutely be crazed killers, and if they were, you'd never suspect it or see it coming. Even if you did, what could be done about a child under 12 whose obsessed with murder? This is a theme explored in the film Home Movie, which had all the makings of a classic and all the talent of a middle school play. I was disappointed right from the start, as this is yet another camcorder film. I understand they are the result of a small budget, but I hate these types of films, simply because it's nearly impossible to watch them without getting nauseous from the constant movement. The story isn't much better, as the film turns out to be nothing more than an experiment. Clare (Cady McClain) is a child psychologist, who just happens to have two psychotic children. Instead of getting them the help they need, she decides to observe them through a cameras lenses and record the findings for a purpose that is never known. Most of the time, the kids are quiet, angry, and bored, but occasionally they find something horrific that peaks their interest, and mom just lets them do it and films it for our benefit. This film is beyond slow, the story is absolutely pointless, and the parents, not to mention the actors portraying them are beyond stupid. Anyone who would read a script like this and agree to do a film like this must be hard up for work, because it was an absolute stinker!",1440028800,,1542,4.5703971119133575
