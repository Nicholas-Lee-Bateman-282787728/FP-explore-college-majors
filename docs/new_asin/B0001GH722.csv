8012197,5,B0001GH722,My husband has flashbacks every time he watches these. Our daughter loves trying to convince us to watch the whole DVD.,1360886400,,119,4.714285714285714
8012198,4,B0001GH722,"This dvd only has 4 Care Bear cartoons, one of which is on the Last Laugh dvd (The Show Must Go On), and one of which is on the Bedtime Stories dvd, (The Old Man and the Light House.) The other two stories are enjoyable if you like the regular stories, and were not previously released on dvd. And there is a Strawberry Shortcake short, but it's new, not an 80's SS cartoon, and I don't like the ""new"" SS, but it is better then the short which was on Care Bears to the Rescue.",1105574400,6,476,4.021052631578947
