2411043,1,B000BBOUWM,"I decided, even after reading many of the negative reviews, to give this movie a chance.  I thought that with Jaime Pressly in it, it couldn't be too bad?  Man, I was wrong.  The movie was just dumb.  I actually prefer the off the wall type comedies, that most reviewers don't like.  But this was just out there.  I never really laughed, except at myself for actually spending $5 to buy the movie.  It was a horrible movie, with an even worse ending.  I wouldn't even spend the money to rent this crapfest.  I would've given it 0 stars if I could've...",1178582400,6,552,4.333333333333333
2411044,3,B000BBOUWM,When I watched this Movie I was thinking I was going to see totally hot Babe Supermodels. The Hotest Girl there was jamie Pressly! The story is Jamies Character gets a Chance to make her big break with the photo shoot of her life if she can get them all to agree to go on to the Island. It takes its pot shoots at the modelling world with regards to diet and pills as all these movies do. These can be the high point. The photgraphers are to gays one who is constantly jealous of the other talking to any one else. These are also a funny pair at time. This is not something you run to the video store to get. It's more like the free one you can choose when you rent the new release. Jamie Pressly is the best the way she tries to keep it all together.,1176249600,,751,3.980132450331126
2411045,3,B000BBOUWM,"This is a comedy about a group of supermodels doing a photo shoot on an island and someone starts killing them off one by one. The biggest suspect is the wannabe ex-model who is coordinating the shoot (Jamie Pressly) and has a voice in her head which talks to her. I thought the concept of the movie was funny. Who doesn't want to see a bunch of dumb, stuck-up supermodels get whacked? Other than a few laughs, the movie falls flat and resorts to fart jokes and stereotypes. It's dumb humor along the lines of 'Scary Movie' or 'Date Movie' but somehow it just doesn't have the same charm as those movies. The ending also, I found unsatisfying and it didn't make as strong of a statement as the rest of the movie. A different ending would have made it a much better movie in my opinion. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of two was because I like Jaime Pressly. Jaime is a great and very versitile actress (see Poison Ivy 3, she plays a wicked sexy psyco chick) and I think she was the one factor that made this movie watchable. She played the role of the 'perky' former model very well and I'd like to see her in more movies. Personally, I think Jaime was the hottest woman in the movie. On the upside, it's got a lot of sexy ladies in bikinis to appeal to men and women will certainly appriciate seeing a bunch of vain, shallow models get killed off. Overall, this movie was not horrid, there are just way funnier comedies out there and I reccomend watching it on cable or renting it before you buy. I might watch it again but I would not pay for it!",1168214400,,1563,4.265993265993266
2411046,3,B000BBOUWM,"Just plain silly.  Liked the beginning, very funny start.  It is just a silly movie start to finish, if you don't like silly, don't buy this one.",1160697600,3,145,4.333333333333333
2411047,1,B000BBOUWM,"I like every actor/actress in this movie that I know of and I really tried to like it, but if a movie ever needed gratuitous nude scenes this was the one, but alas it had but one short meaningless nude scene performed by a unknown and it was her only scene. Sadly that was one of the films highlights. Now I say that because if it had few nude scenes thrown in here and there then the film would be at least veiwable or have fleeting moments of sophmoric humor ... somewhat. It did have a plot, a very weak, very predicable plot that left no room for surprises or guess work unless perhaps you are a little challenged mentally. The surprise ending was lackluster and overall a very poor effort for those involved. It did have Taylor Negron who as a rule is pretty funny, but I'm guessing the budget on this movie was so low that they couldn't afford to pay him to talk as he played a mute and Matt Winston said all his lines. The scenes with Matt Winston (Gerd) and Taylor Negron (Gunther) offered a few chuckles, but for rest of the cast Jaime Pressly, Brooke Burns, Maria Arc, Sung Hi Lee and others they seemed painfully out of place. Granted they are very easy on the eyes, but fall far from comedy they are trying so hard to perform. Even the quasi evil Merle played by Diane Delano who you might remember as Officer Barbara Semanski from ""Northern Exposure"" failed to deliver a quality performance it was for the most part her reviving her role as Semanski.
Overall the movie rambles and roams around never really grabbing your attention or tickling your funny bone. For all of it's effort to be funny it in the end falls to do so. Now for the record, I can handle a bad movie , I can handle really bad movies and I even enjoy them time to time, but somehow I doubt this movie will last long on my bad movie collection for it doesn't make it into the guilty pleasure or midnight movie class of films. Catch it on Comedy Central if you have to see it, it should be there real soon, but don't waste your money on it unless you can rent it for free.
The DVD extras are thin and not very funny, the overall transfer and sound is good but not worth the $3.00 I paid for it.

It would seem the reveiwer that said ""This Movie ROCKS"" has being running around to different review sites, tooting this movies horn, guess they are either in the movie or friends with someone who is, as every other reveiw sight has this film rated at 1 star or less. I know where the ""Rocks"" are and they are not on the screen but they are in Hollywood.",1158883200,10,2530,4.238095238095238
2411048,5,B000BBOUWM,"OK, this movie's hilarious. I saw it when it test-screened last year in LA. Back then I thought it was so funny and totally original that it would be in theatres. I guess a big studio bought it but didn't put it out theatrically. It's so clever and sarcastic you remember it a lot more than your normal popcorn studio comedy. First of all, the ""asexual"" photographers Gunther and Gerd are off the hook. They dress identically in these ridiculous outfits, and one is a mute while the other can read his mind. They point out that they're not gay, they only spoon. They're always fighting over who's gonna be the inner or outer spoon. LOL. The movie's about this magazine editor who organizes a photo shoot for the world's greatest supermodels. Jaime Pressly is so funny as the editor. She's obsessed with supermodels, has their posters all over her room and fantasizes that the supermodels will want to make her one of them. The main supermodel is played by Brooke Burns, Bruce Willis' old girlfriend. I thought she'd just be eye candy, but she's the funniest playing the German supermodel.

Guys will dig the movie because the hot supermodels are in bikinis for like the entire movie, but we like it because we get to see these vain creatures killed off in symbolic and really funny ways. It's a really smart comedy.",1128556800,23,1315,4.643776824034335

8084612,1,B000BBOUWM,I purchased this drek for 5.66 at Kmart and it was a waste of my good money. Jamie Pressly was horrible and the models was vulgar and self-centered. Stay away from this DVD. >:(,1436486400,,177,4.235294117647059

8084614,5,B000BBOUWM,Hilarious.  Jaime Pressly scores well in a slightly different but funny role,1404518400,,76,5.333333333333333

8084616,5,B000BBOUWM,"A funny movie.  Lots of surprises that I never saw coming, which is nice.  The humor is exceedingly juvenile, but they pull it off pretty well.  Some of the plot twists are completely over the top as well.",1357430400,,205,4.342105263157895

8084620,4,B000BBOUWM,"Before I begin my review, let me inform you about the DVD presentation.  Audio and video are excellent; there are English subtitles for those of us, including myself, who are hearing impaired.  It has a widescreen presentation with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  There is a montage of deleted scenes; an interview with P -one of the supermodels; and a host of trailers.  Strangely enough, I didn't see a trailer for ""Death to the Supermodels.""  Now for my review:

  During the eighties, there were numerous movies involving psychopaths murdering models, strippers, and ex-prostitutes, i.e., women, and men, who were gorgeous.  (One of the more famous ones is ""Calendar Girl Murders"" starring a young Sharon Stone.)  ""Death to the Supermodels"" is a silly spoof of such movies.  Though not as hilarious as the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, it will make you laugh and provide a diversion from your worries.

  The following tagline on the back cover of the DVD jacket grabbed my attention while summing up the film's simple plot:  ""They're hot.  They're stupid.  And they're about to get killed.""  Five of the world's greatest supermodels are lured to a secluded island for a photo shoot that will change the image of Merle Magazine.  Each one represents the stereotypical model.  Yo - the funniest of the models - is a black ghetto chic with a steroid pumped derriere who starred in a gangsta rap music video; P is a pouting Hispanic girl who only eats on Thursdays and takes bipolar medication; Hoo Chi is a beautiful Asian who breaks boards with her hands and seeks forgiveness from her deceased grandfather for having breast implants; Darbie is a mannequin-like model who never speaks and barely moves; and Eva is the beautiful German who never bathes or shaves her armpits (pittsies), wears a studded dog collar, and keeps insisting she is the number-one-ranked supermodel.  Tiffany Courtney (Jaime Pressly of ""Poison Ivy - The New Seduction"") is the perky assistant who has organized the weekend photo shoot; she is constantly hearing the disembodied voice of her self-help guru Ryan Reginald telling her she is a serial killer who is jealous of the supermodels.

  One by one, these silly, self-centered supermodels are killed by an intruder wearing a black ninja outfit.  I was hoping the effeminate, asexual photographers would be the first to die because they became tiresome and nauseating very fast.  Their constant bickering over spooning grated on my nerves.  More time should have been spent on the models, some of whom were very hilarious.

  ""Death to the Supermodels"" was filmed in gorgeous Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, which is rich with Spider Monkeys.  It provided the perfect backdrop for this spoof.  I wish I could travel there for vacation.

  ""Death to the Supermodels"" is recommended for those who love silly movie spoofs such as the ""Scary Movie"" series, the ""Airplane"" series, ""Date Movie,"" ""Epic Movie,"" etc.  Unless you can find it at a reasonable price, I recommend renting this movie before purchasing because everyone's tastes in humor are different.",1223164800,4,3073,5.027777777777778
