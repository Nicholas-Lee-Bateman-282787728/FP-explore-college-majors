7385825,5,B014DEGTYO,"What to say about Nurse Jackie? It did very correctly portray what it is like to have an
addict in one's life either as a family member, co-worker or friend.
What this series did poorly was overestimate the functioning capabilities of someone who
is high and their reliability to come to work on time and be functioning.
Even saying that I am glad that this series got made and Edie Falco did a wonderful, wonderful job.",1446336000,8,420,4.5394736842105265
7385826,5,B014DEGTYO,"Wow! Amazing season finale! I am so sad that this show is over--it was one of the most compelling TV shows that I can remember. The ending is perfect.

What I loved about Nurse Jackie was that it showed how painful life is; how imperfect both life and people are; and how we need to have compassion for everyone, because everyone suffers. Instead of judging, we should have empathy, and we should always try to help.

I find it interesting that all of the characters were judgmental of Jackie's drug use, but they were perfectly fine with their own drug use (Jackie and Carrie taking mushrooms) and excessive alcohol intake. It mirrors society's view of alcohol (despite it being the cause of more death and destruction than drugs) as a perfectly acceptable drug. Too bad the show never highlighted this hypocrisy.

(Interestingly, I got to hear Anna Deveare Smith speak at Stanford last month, and now I have a whole new appreciation for her as an actress.)

I'm sorry to see you go, Nurse Jackie!",1446249600,5,998,4.685714285714286
7385827,5,B014DEGTYO,"Great final season, and yes, it was time for the series to end, or at the very least change course, as Jackie's addiction and all that it entails was becoming monotonous.  Great finale.",1445558400,7,185,4.606060606060606

7385831,5,B014DEGTYO,"note: For anyone who is interested in Zoe, that actress is now part of the ""Walking Dead"" cast. She again plays a medical worker but one not skilled enough to do the complicated things the community wants.

One Amazon reader wrote to ask me to put in a SPOILER ALERT. I did everything I could to avoid spoilers but perhaps she has a point. Thus, you are now warned.

This is the final season of Nurse Jackie. I think it does a fine job of closing out the series. Jackie still has problems with drugs. As usual, she does everything in her power to deny she has this problem. She also does her usual amount of unsavory acts to other people to forward her drug agenda. God help you if you get in her way over drugs. Yet she still of course wants to be a nurse too.

All the usual characters are present. This season we also have Tony Shaloub (MONK) added to the cast as a doctor. He does a very good job and he is nothing like his Monk character. This character has a host of ex wives in his past plus some developing memory problems which seem to be escalating.

Gloria and Jackie fight almost through the entire season. Gloria no longer believes Jackie can ever get drug free. She believes Jackie should be kicked out of nursing. Jackie fights her tooth and nail. Zoe finally has Jackie's number on the drugs but she is a softie at heart and at several junctures still wavers. Zoe eventually begins to see a way to get free of Jackie and thus end her involvement in a relationship which is probably doomed. She is as likable as Jackie is unlikable. Eddie wants to marry Jackie and he is as much in love with her as ever.

This season has one episode which does something this show never has done before. I wish it had. It has one long scene where after Jackie has ingested a lot of cocaine, we the audience see the world as she sees it in her drugged haze. This is the only time the show visually shows us the enormous attraction this woman has  towards drugs. No amount of words could ever equal it. Jackie is walking on a idealized Manhattan street as we enter her mind for this interlude. She is on an entirely different plane of existence.

I liked the concluding episode. Some viewers did not. This is always a thorny issue when a series ends.",1440547200,52,2247,4.297872340425532

7385894,5,B014DEGTYO,"In its last season, nurse Jackie definitely was losing many of its humorous aspects and focused more on a more depressing reality which was finally happening with the MAJOR change at "" all saints hospital.""  Nurse Jackie remains consistent with her character until the last moment with a sad send off. I guess this could be a moral message, but we love Jackie and want the best for her
The significant reduction of humor makes it harder to watch Jackie and could garner lesser evaluations from others, but we must see that a more dramatic turn when you are expecting more humor will make you feel as if the series was failing when it actually was a realistic continuation of the drug addiction narrative. Things do not always turn out as we would hope Enjoy.",1471219200,2,758,4.614814814814815

This is the only show I can think of where I loved every character....even the ones that were the alleged ""bad guys.""  Edie Falco does an amazing job as Nurse Jackie.  And even while being a drug addict, her friends and family still stand by her in different ways.  I hope another show like this comes along that I can sink my teeth into like I did this one.  P.S.

7385926,4,B014DEGTYO,"So much humanness was how the Accolitus character described the series and I would agree.
I enjoyed the situations of Jackie and other characters and the dynamics.
This season had a great visit by Tony Shalhoub and he was excellent.
Much feeling throughout the series: laughter, tears, shock, joy and sadness.
Very realistic portrayals of drug use and abuse and relationship issues.
I know that there are plenty of homosexuals in New York, but I get tired of having that sick promotion shoved down my throat.
Two guys kissing and getting married?
The actors are doing their best to act like it's as natural as the sun setting and rising. NOT.
There are many instinctual and learned behaviors, and really, many of them are not to be indulged.
Natural behavior includes things like lying, stealing, crazy violence, murder, rape, sexual deviances, etc.
There have always been real people , less than perfect, and that's life.
The Catholic Church got into big trouble back in the day by selling indulgences.
I really enjoyed this series though.
Drama and realistic stuff.",1455494400,,1067,4.966480446927374

7385928,1,B014DEGTYO,"I liked the show until it shortly became clear it was typical leftist degenerate crap, with a mission to proselytize every liberal agenda imaginable. Everyone is a homosexual, a whore, a transvestite, drug addicts and glorified angles like getting free (of course they never mention someone eventually has to pay for whatever they want to steal) healthcare...Hollywood just can't help themselves but to ram their degenerate political agenda down everyone's throat...Of course they write characters that reflect themselves, and the constant crap they are fed from their fellow entertainment bags of crap, so I suppose I should expect no less.

The only thing that kept the show afloat was stealing Alcoholics Anonymous wisdom and storyline, and of course even that was stolen. The writers know full well that one of the tenets of AA is not to publicize for profit AA.",1454544000,2,866,5.141843971631205

7385947,3,B014DEGTYO,"Thank god, the show has ended. The sociopath Jackie comes to hopefully a completely dead end. Her reign of destruction, predatory behavior, corruption, lying, manipulation, criminal activity, pathology, and did I say, destruction, ends. Really liked it the first few seasons especially the hospital/workplace stories, dynamics, interactions. Showed how addiction can be so problematic for the individual and those who know them. Stayed with it because of the great cast and characters and humor mainly provided by Zoey and the endearing Coop, Akalitus, and O'Hara, even as the writers choices began to turn my stomach and the pathetic enabling and cluelessness by everyone around her became utterly ludicrous. And screwing Kevin's character with the mortgages twist putting Jackie on top again and out of reach of sustained, real accountability was stupid and a cheap shot at Kevin. When she used the dying nun to get the DEA and Akalitus off her trail I was repulsed and finally, no one takes that much drugs on duty for so long and doesn't get noticed and make medical errors. Doesn't happen. Fanciful, humorous, grotesque. Truly, thank god, she's dead.",1452988800,4,1155,5.21505376344086

You should watch it from the beginning of season 1 until the very last episode of season 7 or don't watch it at all.

She is, in essence, dating her ""dealer"".....but he WAS the only one who loved her for who she was when everyone else abandoned her. And I mean everyone. Pretty shitty for O'Hara to ditch, then show up in the final episode to give Jackie a high and mighty lecture...especially after her early role as enabler.  My absolute favorite scene was Dr. Roman and Zoe on shrooms in the park, bonding as gfs. So random.  Akolitus takes accountability for her misdirected power trip, but hardly soon enough. Her hypocritical evolution into pit bull was a fail on the writers' parts. Jackie's relationship with her Moon Pie-faced brat of a daughter had its obligatory wrap up with the college drop off. None too soon. See ya kid, punt. Sad to see Zoe become somewhat of a disillusioned nurse, albeit a mature one. Thank you, Showtime, for such a fabulous ride!!!",1532995200,,973,4.785714285714286
