7554650,5,B018TNKDOW,"In this new Hallmark ""Countdown to Christmas"" film, we watch Candace Cameron  Bure in another favorite lead performance as ""Paige Summerlind"". She is upscale herself and engaged to be married; a writer for an high-end Bridal Magazine being drawn to her latest issue in a store in the Los Angeles airport as she is contemplating catching her flight to Manhattan. Along with her is the firstly unknown and seemingly bitter counterpart aboard the plane who espouses opposing opinions, Dylan Smith (Peter Greene). We view them light up the screen with their chemistry in a sort of mixed-up and bantering back and forth tale.

While Paige is scurrying to board her flight to get to her wedding planned for Christmas Eve and to meet her new and high-profit family to be a few days beforehand - Dylan is not so happy to be hurting over his own lost relationship while contemplating it on the same flight. Paige must get to New York in order to meet her new future in-laws and is very upset as the plane is grounded because of a blinding snowstorm. Every plane is grounded, nothing is running and what's a girl to do? Candace Cameron Bure is her spunky self in this film as I always enjoy her to be while Peter Greene is able to match her quick wit flawlessly. I enjoyed their dialog in this film more than most and the pleasantly done scenery which didn't look like some of the Christmas features that are available. This story rings more truly for me.

Since their doomed flight had been grounded because of a massive blizzard, they must come up with another way to get where they are each going in enough time. It does become a battle of wills with her wedding plans until the time is right for Paige who is finding out the whole wedding is out of her own control, is planned by others and she is much scrutinized even though she has done all of her homework. Paige does have to drive through all of the bad weather first to get herself to the wedding on time to meet her in-laws and it does get dire; but is Paige changing her mind throughout that long ride and believing that opinion of Soul Mates being real in the form of a mutually shared love. Does she take on the buttoned-up life she is so craving for herself or will she want what real love may offer her - It does come in both of these forms so now only Paige can decide for herself.

I don't wish to give away too much of this enjoyable storyline in this Hallmark movie as I found it one of the better ones. I hope you agree. Kick back and enjoy this film - And have a Happy Holiday!",1449100800,12,2539,4.361522198731501

This is one of my favorite movies about the quest to find the one right person we were meant to marry. The actress has a check-list and she finds out, what she thought she wanted in her soul-mate - wasn't the soul-mate she was meant for. Cute story and love the characters and story.  Fun humor and storyline. You will love it as I did.",1520640000,,425,4.246913580246914

There are fresher story lines around and more interesting or charming ways to present them.  I did like the secondary story line very much.",1515283200,,269,4.680851063829787
7554678,5,B018TNKDOW,"This movie is about true love, friendship, and family.  It is one of my favorite Hallmark Christmas movies.  Paige learns somewhat the hard way what is truly important to her - not a storybook wedding but her, Happily ever after.  Besides that, who wouldnt fall for Paul Green?!  Candace is a beautiful actress and woman and I never miss one of her movies.
The description of this movie is wrong.  The other couple are on their way to visit their daughter and her husband.  They are very funny with their outlook towards each other but as Hallmark always manages to do in a Hallmark movie, even they learned what true love means.
If you haven't seen Christmas Detour, you should still watch it even though Christmas is over.  You will thoughrly enjoy it!",1515110400,,754,4.62406015037594
7554679,5,B018TNKDOW,Good Christmas show.,1514937600,,20,6.0
7554680,3,B018TNKDOW,"Meh. Candace Cameron-Bure's character was almost completely unlikeable in this, and they didn't even give her a good reason for being shallow, judgmental and unpleasant. Oh, except she grew up poor with a single mom! Of course she'd be that way (*eyeroll*).

It also follows the ridiculous-even-by-Hallmark standard of falling madly in love enough to leave your long-term relationship after literally only knowing someone, what, two days? And I could get on board with that (at least when it's just a movie) if they at least really sold me on the romance by showing some major, soulmate-level bonding happening over those two days. These two hardly spent any time alone together because of the other couple with them (which I get from a writing standpoint, because it would have been dangerous to send the message that it's normal for a woman traveling alone to go on a road trip with a guy she just met, but still), and the time they did spend together was almost all that juvenile, ""The woman shows her attraction by being rude and the guy shows his by being pushy and still trying really hard to get her attention in spit of her rudeness"" stuff.

It held my attention well enough, but the overall premise and the characters themselves didn't exactly tug at my heart strings.",1514505600,4,1277,4.773755656108597

7554692,5,B018TNKDOW,"My second favorite Hallmark movie from my favorite Hallmark actress, Candace Cameron Bure. (My favorite is Let it Snow also starring Candace.) A Christmas Detour is a cute story about a girl (Candace) trying to make it to her fianc's parents' home for Christmas to meet them for the very first time before their wedding. The winter storm has the plane detour and delays her trip when planes are grounded for days. She strikes up a friendship with a married couple and a single guy, who were on the detoured plane with her. They all stay in the same hotel overnight provided by the airlines, and they bond over their frustration of being stuck due to weather conditions. When the guy rents a car and invites the couple and Candace's character to drive to their destination instead, the roadtrip provides many insightful information. They learn not only about each other, but about themselves as well.",1511740800,2,899,4.806451612903226

7554697,5,B018TNKDOW,"Another good Christmas movie from Hallmark.  I saw it on TV first, and waited until it came out of video.  If you are familiar with the many Christmas type movies that Hallmark puts out each season, you will know what to expect  . . .  no foul language, no violence, no inappropriate content.  Its a simple plot about a woman (who is obsessed with her fantasy of being in love with the perfect man), traveling to meet her rich fiances family for Christmas. Then, a snow storm leaves her stranded with a man that she at first cannot stand, and another couple that seems headed for divorce.  A few days away from trying to live her dream of what love is, teaches her about real love.  A very simple plot,  but the actors make it enjoyable for the entire family.",1508198400,,759,4.371428571428571

7554780,5,B018TNKDOW,"I gave this a five, not because I liked the movie that much, but because I liked the character Candace Cameron Bure played. It was different for her in several places and it was nice to see her being a total ditzy, annoying person. She always plays someone who is so perfect or who starts out as totally snooty but becomes perfect. At times she seems almost to be an airhead, which was different and worth seeing. I loved the look on her face and the remark ""There was a spark"" when talking about her future husband. She actually snorts when she laughs (totally unacceptable in her husband-to-be's family.) It's not surprising how it's going to end and who is going to end up together but this one takes some surprising twists and turns. I liked it enough to buy it and I'm sure I'll watch it several times. A few times ""little Miss Perfect"" shows up but it's not often and I really enjoy seeing Candace be a regular person.",1483315200,,924,4.409356725146199

7554792,4,B018TNKDOW,"Two passengers on a flight to New York City.  One is a shameless braggart (Candace Cameron Bure as Paige).  She is presented as annoying, argumentative, demanding, entitled.........I must have an aisle seat!  She is a writer for Radiant Bride and is opulently impressed with her many opinions on practically everything.  She bullies her way into getting an aisle seat and gets more than she bargained for when her seatmate (Paul Greene as Dylan) questions her motives, opinions, her focus, and her dopey vision board that she drags everywhere (a visual aid to remind her of her own perfection).  Unfortunately, a snowstorm gets in her way, causing them to be rerouted to Buffalo, where they have to spend the night.  Not to be deterred by the weather, the next day Paige makes a stand in the airport, befriending a married couple with a long marriage and little to show for it.  She will make it to New York City or else!
Many complications ensue, not the least of which involves Paiges not so perfect fianc and his patronizing parents.  Romance never runs smoothly in a Hallmark movie, and this one is no exception.",1482710400,,1116,4.776041666666667

It's the reality of life- that the experiences we have presently matter more than what we ever thought possible.  Men can watch this movie too, but they may get annoyed with the main character's mentality of going on & on about her life the way she planned it to be- that's why I mentioned that women would relate likely more to this movie than men. Again, great movie & great reminder to live in the present moment, take the chance, and embrace it with love. ~",1481932800,,673,4.384

I usually find her acting to be insipid and somewhat gag inducing. I would have to say though that this movie is probably the best of her films, mostly because she is really convincing as a self-absorbed airhead.

7554830,5,B018TNKDOW,"Well, have to say first, I love Candace Cameron Bure,,,,, and liked this movie very much.  However, in my opinion, the ""other"" couple stole the movie from my perspective.  Why?  So many marriages seem to fall apart after a few years.  The couples seem to forget what they saw in each other in the beginning.  Which is where the 2nd couple in this story find themselves.  Candace's character, in her role as a magazine writer, doesn't seem to notice the couple's coolness to each other.  Nor does she hear their sarcastic jibes at each other.  All Candace's character wants, in her perkiness, is to interview them as they drive thru the snow.  The questions she asks them and their reaction as the story unfolds, is what was so important to me.  They answer her quickly, but then seem to ponder the questions and start to wonder for themselves when did it change.  One scene in particular told their whole story, as far I was concerned.  Late one night as they are starting to fall asleep,,,, the wife asks her husband, When Did We Stop Kissing Goodnight?  Hopefully, if this was real life, that would be the first step for this or any couple to start healing a limping marriage.  Cute movie,,,,, I'll watch it again and again.",1476144000,,1226,4.589861751152074

7554843,1,B018TNKDOW,"I'm a huge fan of ""Let it Snow"" and ""Christmas Under Wraps"" (as well as many other Hallmark/Lifetime movies), both of which starred Candace Cameron Bure.  So I was excited to see another Christmas movie starring Candace.  I was so disappointed in this one, though.  The main reason: the plot (formulaic), and the main character (whiny, self-centered, unlikable).  I just couldn't get on board with the protagonist.  I was also disappointed in the little town they stopped at along the way, I wanted it to be more magical, and it didn't feel that way (to me).

Note: even though I watch a lot of these types of movies, I don't universally love them all, just because they're holiday films or family entertainment.  I.e. I don't love Hallmark movies just because they're on Hallmark channel.  They still need to be good, they need to surprise me, they need to have characters I like with actors who give life to the roles and bring their personality into it.  Ditto Lifetime.  I would say that every year, the channel releases about 20 movies or more, and out of that 20, there are several that I think are great for a one time viewing and I never need to see them again, several that I think weren't worth my time (boring, predictible plots, or the actors didn't bring bright personalities to their characters), and maybe a handful that I want to see again, maybe only a couple I want to own.  It varies year by year (one year, I wanted to own 6 of the movies - it was a great year!  Another year, I didn't want to own a single one).

Favorite actresses in Hallmark movies: Candace Cameron Bure (but not this movie at all), Lacey Chabert, Danica McKellar (she knows how to read and pick a script!), Hilarie Burton (she was AMAZING in Naughty or Nice), Katrina Law (Snow Bride was adorable and mostly due to her comedic timing, but 12 Gifts of Christmas was not, there was not much Katrina could do with the character she was given).

Anyhow, if your tastes mirror my own, I would say to skip this one.  If you like ANYTHING Hallmark produces, no matter the quality, then by all means, you won't be disappointed in this one!  But if you like a little more substance, SKIP this.",1472342400,34,2175,4.510204081632653

7554885,5,B018TNKDOW,"Great Christmas movie.  I've always like Candace.  I've got several of her movies.  Paul Greene if fairly new to me.  Handsome and good actor.  The story line is good.  Two people meet by chance on a not so great trip from L.A. to New York.  The weather didn't cooperate with their plans.
Paige ( Candace) was going to New York to meet her soon to be in laws for the first time and Dylan ( Paul) to see his family after four years.
Frank and Maxine travel with them by car and are a delightful addition to the story.  As is always with Hallmark movies the end is just as you think it will be.  But as the saying goes ""It's not the predictable beginning and end but the journey you take getting there.  I loved the movie and recommend it to anyone that likes a romance/comedy.",1455753600,3,775,4.210884353741497

I loved it on the Hallmark Station this Season,It was a little pricey but After All the Activities are Done & the Christmas Stuff Is put away for Next Year, I really enjoy watching some of the BETTER DVD's from Hallmark. We are so busy preparing for The Big Day,I miss this show or that,the beginning or the end ,that's why I take My time after Christmas To enjoy All Over Again!",1452384000,,400,4.346666666666667
7554893,2,B018TNKDOW,"Candace Cameron Bure movies are always wonderful.  This one, I hate to say, is a bit of a dud.  Just wasn't up to her standards.  Maybe just wasn't written well for her.",1452124800,2,169,4.21875
7554894,5,B018TNKDOW,Totally disagree with the one review  saying it was creepy? There was absolutely nothing creepy about this charming romantic sweet movie! And when you're with the wrong person when the right one comes along there is nothing creepy about that at all....it's fate.... And both Cameron and Paul played this movie beautifully -the entire cast was good! And let's face is Paul Greene is one of the most beautiful actors on the face of the earth....huge Bitten fan and happy to see him in more Hallmark movies ahead in 2016 too! Highly recommend this movie it's adorable!,1451520000,5,565,4.824742268041237
7554895,5,B018TNKDOW,I just got this movie at Wal-mart today. I think this is a great movie. I just watched it on the hallmark network this year.,1451260800,3,124,4.0
7554896,1,B018TNKDOW,"Christmas Detour did not do anything for me.  It didn't give me feeling of Christmas.  It gave me the creeps!  And it was somewhat disgusting too.  I always felt like the Paul Greene character was on the make, walking around in his robe, trying to kiss Candace when he knew she was engaged.  And the other couple sort of encouraged him to do that.  Candace's fianc and family weren't very nice either so I didn't feel attachment to them or the Candace character.  I just felt like this was a very bad Christmas date.

The Let It Snow movie is far superior.  That rocks and I make a point to see it every year.",1450915200,2,609,4.271929824561403
7554897,4,B018TNKDOW,"If you enjoy films where everything seems to go wrong and plans constantly change, this may be the film for you. Paige (Candace Cameron Bure) is a businesswoman who is traveling to meet her future in laws for Christmas and to plan her wedding with her future mother-in-law. Enter cute-and-funny male lead Dylan (Paul Greene) who also happens to be at the right place at the right time to meet Paige as they are both traveling to NYC and just happen to sit next to each other on their first flight of the day.  You might be entertained as he has the typical ""I don't believe in true love"" attitude because of a past relationship that left him jaded. Spoiler Warning: They may or may not ""find love"" with each other.
  I tend to not enjoy films that include traveling issues because they hit a little too close to home (think RV starring Robin Williams). Like many of you, I have experienced several flight cancelations and changes during a layover once that made my trip home last over 30 hours. Although, I didn't reach my final destination with a new boyfriend because my life is not like a real life hallmark made-for-TV Christmas movie (thank goodness) Haha.
If you like hallmark films, Christmas Under Wraps is really cute and also features Candace Cameron Bure (or DJ from Full House, if you will) as a physician who moves to a small town in Alaska to begin her practice. I prefer it over A Christmas Detour but if you don't mind the traveling misadventures you will probably enjoy this cute film. Four stars because of Candace Cameron Bure and because I'd feel bad giving any less than that. Merry Christmas!!",1450396800,4,1615,4.600694444444445
7554898,4,B018TNKDOW,Bought it; good movie,1450224000,,21,4.5
7554899,4,B018TNKDOW,"Pushy and self-absorbed Paige Summerlind (Candace Cameron Bure) pens articles for Radiant Bride magazine, and check her out at LAX beaming over the magazine stand. The latest issue is out on display with her latest article, ""100 Ways to Find Your Perfect Mate,"" prominent on the cover. Good for her. Paige is check list happy. She'd probably be over the moon were someone to gift her with more boxes to tick off. With Christmas two days away, Paige catches a flight from LAX to NYC so as to meet her fianc Jack's parents. Not that weather systems give a crap about plans conceived by mere mortals. A massive snow storm paralyzes the eastern seaboard, diverts her flight and grounds it at Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

So here's Paige super-anxious to get to New York in time for the all-important meet and greet with the fianc's judgy parents. But with flights all over delayed to kingdom come and the transit system on strike, she may have to rely on cranky fellow passenger Dylan Smith (Paul Greene) to get her there. Except she can't stand Dylan, embittered bar owner and victim of a most heinous break-up. Dylan, turns out, has got the best excuse for not wanting to come home for Christmas. I'm surprised he even tried. Wouldn't it be a swerve if Paige and Dylan don't fall in love?

So Paige and Dylan fall in love. Just as we expected. The journey's the thing. What Hallmark does so well with its rehashed plot points is that it pairs up actors who work well together and who generate great chemistry. And Bure and Greene generate great chemistry with their exasperated looks and heated banter. Hallmark does throw in a swerve by including Frank and Maxine Harper (David Lewis, Sarah Strange), a jaded couple who after twenty years of marriage have grown lukewarm toward each other. But maybe, in their tagging along with our leads, Frank and Maxine will regain a measure of grace with each other. If they were just thrown in just to fill in those empty spaces in the movie, it worked. I found myself pretty invested in them.

Let's do our own Hallmark X-mas movie checklist. Single Caucasian girl as the lead? Check. Fianc/boyfriend who we right away know isn't right for her? Check. A quirky little town that seems to celebrate Christmas the whole year 'round? Check. Silly obstacle that develops late to keep our couple apart? Check. All that's missing is the big holiday festival. But here's the thing. A CHRISTMAS DETOUR executes its retread like a boss. The key ingredient is always to have a cast of well-liked actors, and that's so with this movie. Candace Cameron Bure, I say more than any other of this network's rotating roster of female leads, has become the face of Hallmark holiday movies. And there's a reason. Bure is perfectly lovable even when she's being insufferable. So, yeah, do watch this movie. It's dotted with good humor, a predictable yet dandy romance, and a warmth that perseveres despite Paige's peccadillos and Dylan's persistent cynicism. Also, here's a fun fact: Bure's real-life daughter sings the theme song.",1449878400,30,3060,4.802656546489564
7554900,5,B018TNKDOW,"It's Countdown to Christmas time, and here's a pretty good entry with ever watchable Candace Cameron Bure caught in a snowy, predictable (Of course they all are) romcom roadtrip Hallmark style.

Trying to get to NYC for Christmas and to meet her stuffy fiance's family, magazine writer, Paige(Bure) clashes with romance soured but handsome Dylan(Paul Greene).  Both obnoxious in their own ways, they constantly cross paths and words as the plane gets diverted to soon to be snow buried Buffalo.  Joining up with a veteran but stiff marriage couple, they end up trekking by car to the Big Apple via small town and various mild mishaps.

Expect all the usual Hallmark trappings, good, nice looking actors, good editing and direction(Ron Oliver- who did one of my all time favorite CTC super offerings- Love at the Thanksgiving Parade), too much Hallmark background music, some light humor, and getting caught under the mistletoe(with a bit of a twist).  This is my 2nd Christmas movie this season with Ms. Cameron Bure(Hallmark's Let it Snow)- I like this one better; however, if you like her, like we do, she's always fun to watch- showing warmth, humor and vulnerbility.

It's amazing to me how many of these almost by the numbers(but with pleasant differences) CTC movies we've watched and enjoyed.  What's wrong with us?  We love romance(especially if the leads match up well), clean humor and a gentle/simple moral story and happily ever after ending.  I guess it's a good thing- but of course!  4-4 1/2 stars.  I'll give it 5- Merry Christmas.",1449532800,,1547,4.957364341085271
