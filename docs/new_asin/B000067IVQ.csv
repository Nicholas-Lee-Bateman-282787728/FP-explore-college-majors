1715139,4,B000067IVQ,"The second season of Space 1999 was very different from season one. Monsters and humor abound in season two. Most of the episodes are ridiculous, but filled with guilty pleasures.
Every episode in set 7 is a real hoot!
""Seed of Destruction"" is about an evil mirror image of Koenig who takes over Alpha. Evil Koenig is a mean S.O.B.! The only thing better than an evil Koenig is when Koenig freaks-out in ""Bringers of Wonder"". Classic!
""The Beta Cloud"" involves a nasty cloud that sends a wild bug-eyed monster to steal the entire life support system of Alpha. The creature runs amok on the moon base for the entire episode
while the cloud tries to persuade the Alphans that it's a non-violent cloud and they should just give up the life support system and die, but the Alphan's just won't listen. They are a stubborn lot.
""A Matter of Balance"" features the lovely Lynn Frederick! There's also a bald translucent anti-matter spirit, a bug-eyed samurai creature, and Maya turns into a monkey! Tony makes more bad beer in this one too, and he makes Lynn drink it and then makes her cry! Who in their right mind would make the lovely Lynn cry?! Damn that Tony! First he get's Maya and now this!
""Space Warp"" is about Maya going bananas and transforming into various dangerous forms that attack the base, but the absolute best is that she turns into the bug-eyed monster from the ""Beta Cloud""! It's back and running amok and attacking Alpha again, BUT this time it's wearing a wild wig that looks like dread-locks! Plus, Barabara Bain and Nick Tate chase it around the moon's surface in a moon buggy! Keep plenty of oxygen on hand for this one!
""Bringers of Wonder"" is a two part episode with slimy aliens that only Koenig can see. There's nothing like a talented actor freaking-out with slimy aliens. This one includes the classic Koenig line: ""I haven't had this much fun since I burned grand ma's wig""! Nobody freaks-out like Koenig!
Set 7 is filled with addictive gems such as these. Ed Wood would be proud of these episodes. This is one of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.",1075680000,4,2078,4.60377358490566
1715140,5,B000067IVQ,"I just watched this set with some friends and had a blast! The monsters are cheesy, but oddly enough there's fine acting in the episodes and some really engaging moments along with all the cheese. The one consistent factor is that this is a very entertaining set of discs.",1073865600,,272,4.571428571428571
1715141,2,B000067IVQ,"I remember, as a kid, the second series was cool because of all the neat creatures the character of Maya would change into; boy, was I so easy to entertain back then?  Now, looking at series two, I wince at the changes Anderson made to the series.  Gone was Barry Morse, who added a very human element to the experience of Moonbase Alpha.  Gone was the dark, command center.  Gone was the tension even trying to survive against uncertain odds in space.  What replaced all this?  Gaucho skirts, more make-up and more action violence in the series.  Adding Catherine Schell and skirting all the females was an obvious attempt to sex up the series.  Good stories were now sacrificed for gratuitous fisticuffs.  Now Moonbase Alpha has become a love boat of joking and good vibrations, not to mention cheesier set designs, poorer film quality, and awful awful awful costumes!  Space Warp is complete garbage, while the Bringers of Wonder was no excuse for a two-part episode, let alone one.  A Matter of Balance is an anti-matter episode that was done much better in the first season with A Matter of Life and Death.  Beta Cloud is imbicilic, but that would be nothing compared to Brian the Brain, (which you can find on another set)!  Is this series worth watching?  Yeah, but abandon all expectation ye who go there.",1055116800,3,1313,4.701754385964913
1715142,3,B000067IVQ,"You can almost hear Spock saying a line such as that one. There are many lines and ideas and storylines Fred Friedberger continued to rip-off from Star Trek and shove into Space:1999. There are many ridiculous concepts and explanations in this series, but Season 2 adds more reasons why the general public never caught onto the program. There also seems to be a lack of creativity in monsters and alien races. The same ludicrous and dated alien/monster appears in three consecutive stories, only slightly altered so the viewer won't be able to tell the difference. And not to improve on imperfection, the teleplays(script editing) and acting can be really embarassing at times. Though the production values still look good as with the model effects. If there was one thing Friedburger achieved for Season 2, was that the characters are little more likable. Season 1 featured too many wooden performances and not enough character interaction. Now, some of the interaction between characters in Season 2 is just unbearable at times, it can be amusing. And, this is also the best looking of the DVD releases. The extras have a certain crispness to it. But those theatrical trailers are COD-awful!
Seed of Destruction: Ok, a remake of the last Star Trek serial from Season 3. Landau could've played it a little more hammier.
And the ending couldn't have been more rushed.
The Beta Cloud: A guilty pleasure with Anholt and Schell trying to steal the show with their acting. there are so many unanswered questions and ridiculous concepts in this one, you couldn't count them on repeated viewings. The bug-eyed robot/monster will appear re-dressed in the next 2 adventures. A Friedburger classic.
A Matter of Balance: Would've been tolerable without the ludicrous concept of antimatter. Shouldn't it have been ""another dimension""?
Space Warp: Is only good for it's model effects. The Eagle Hangar crash scene is not to be missed. Other than that, you were warned about another Friedburger classic.
The Bringers of Wonder Parts 1 & 2: The best of the lot, and one of the best of the season, but that's not saying much. There are discontinuity problems and of course ridiculous explanations. But Part 1 is great, with Landau completely overacting at the sight of the creatures. he also has some stupid lines at the beginnig: ""I haven't had this much fun since I burned Grandma's wig!"" and ""Big daddy's coming in!! Yaaaaaa!!!!"" Part 2 does let down, but there's a great Season 1 line at the end. But of course, all Season 2 serials end with a frozen laugh scene.
This show may be absolutely stupid, but I still enjoy it and get a guilty pleasure from a program I grew up with...",1048550400,2,2668,4.8659340659340655
1715143,3,B000067IVQ,"SPACE 1999: Set Number 7 is the second to last in a series of the episodes for the second season. I must admit these episodes are interesting but the overall acting needs a little to be desired. Catherine Schell and Tony Anholt really are trying, but with all the fake monster outfits and bad one-liners - its almost funny.
Technically again the show looks good. The costumes got colorful and they try and shoot lasers almost every episode. Its is interesting how the try to FORCE the humor in the show and it doesn't come naturally with the characters.
The comlocks, eagles and Stun Guns are still cool. See my reviews of the other 6 sets and the one to follow. I really did love the first season - and fell out of love in the second. You decide.",1027468800,3,747,4.381294964028777
1715144,5,B000067IVQ,"The latest installment in the A&E ""Space: 1999"" DVD sets serves up another helping of the discofied second season of this amazing sci-fi series.
Set 7 has much to recommend it, including a behind-the-scenes segment showing both the size of the Alpha Moonbase model, and an eagle rising on the launch pad lift. There are also copious notes on the history and contruction of Alpha, as well as some concept drawings from some early episodes.
Another good thing about this set is that it shows the change in quality from the early part of the season. After a strong start, episodes quickly degenerated into tripe such as ""All That Glisters"". However, those growing pains seem to come to an end over the course of this particular set.
Probably the worst episode here (""Space Warp""), still has a few things going for it. For one thing, there is a spectacular explosion in an Eagle hangar. Lots of good detailing in the models here, and a big helping of the show's signature sparkly explosions.
""Beta Cloud"" is another Year Two episode that gets a bad rap, but it too has some memorable moments. Tony takes command in a crisis and comes off looking pretty good (although he stupidly frees the monster he only just caught in the pressure chamber). Also interesting is that Tony and Maya flat out admit to loving each other, as opposed to the standard ""unspoken attraction"" that was the norm on many shows. We also get to see the forgotten Year Two extra, Bill Fraser, take some action as he sets up a last-ditch defense to stop the monster. Plus, Sandra (or ""Saan"", if you prefer), actually has a pretty good part in this one.
Included in this set is the two-part ""Bringers of Wonder"", which again highlights the wonderful ideas and concepts the creative staff were coming up with in Year Two, only to be hamstrung by poor execution and/or writing.
A case in point is Koenig's reaction to the aliens in ""Bringers of Wonder"". Knowing that his friends suspect his mental state, Koenig freaks out anyway, screaming, yelling, and basically going out of his way to look like anything BUT sane. After his initial reaction upon first seeing the creatures, a Year One Koenig would've tried to play it cool. But the Year Two Koenig just flips out, and it isn't until the second episode that he gets control of himself long enough to convince Helena and Maya that he's not bananas.
There are some truly bizzare lines in this one, too:
Koenig: ""I haven't had so much fun since I burned Grandma's wig!""
And then later, he turns around and says something crypticly cool, such as:
""It's better to live as your own man, than to live as a fool in someone else's dream!""
This half-and-half writing is typical of Year Two.
All of this plays out before some great new sets, ideas, lighting, and action. The interior of the nuclear waste dome is one of the best sets, large, expansive, and sensible (in other words, a pleasant throwback to Year One). The concept of the aliens hiding their true nature is wonderful sci-fi. The ""visions"" of Carter and the other affected Alphans are very well done. One thing to look for is the alien taking over the crewman in the Records Section. Note the great work by Frank Watts and his lighting crew! The alien is standing at a window, looking in on the crewman. As the camera swings around the alien, his face is kept in shadow, thus creating a menacing effect.
All in all, a nice installment despite the Koenig disco freak-out, and the pathetically obvious telescope-turned-prop Carter uses as a laser.
I have to admit that I'm really enjoying these Year Two episodes, which is something I never thought I would ever do. I see more in them now, and more to appreciate after all these years without them. Maya and Tony aren't nearly as dopey as I remember, and in fact, they're kinda interesting.
Year One is hands-down superior, but Year Two is still worth of buying as a fun, campy blast from your younger days.",1025049600,5,3924,4.639367816091954
1715145,5,B000067IVQ,"My favorate episode then and now. Maya saves the day . After Alpha is threatened by a huge monster bent on stealing the life support , its up to Maya to stop it. This is such a fun episode, particularly the chase scenes. Seed of Destruction and Space Warp are fun too. The Bringers of Wonder can finaly be seen after all these years. We can forget about that horrible patched together movie version.  I almost bought the Columbia House videos , but when I heard that they were coming out on dvd, i waited for over a year. The wait was worth it. Not only is the quality better than videos, you get all the bonuses videos lack. Set  7 has a huge gallery of behind the scenes photos and artwork. Its fun, fun, fun to watch the behind the scenes trailer. I hear there is an effort to revive this classic show... Lets have a season 3...",1024963200,3,831,4.220125786163522
1715146,5,B000067IVQ,"The best of Space 1999 is finaly out! Towards the end of season 2 there was a dramatic improvement in story and script quality. And the dvd quality has also improved with double the amount of bonuses of previouse volumes.
Seed of Destruction: Commander Koenig is held prisoner on an asteroid made of crystal while his doppleganger orders Alpha to use a giant laser to destroy the asteroid. In order to do this all power from Alpha will be drained.
The Beta Cloud: I have waited 22 years to see this great episode again, it was worth the wait! The Beta Cloud is like being on a rollercoaster ride its so fast paced. An alien creature tries to steal the life support system for power. Nothing can stop it,lasers,chloroform,electricity, even lack of air. Its unstoppable! Its Darth Vader! Before relocating to a farther away galaxy, David Prowse made a brief visit to Moonbasealpha.
This episode seems to be everyones favorate, I have to agree. The sets are amazing and the film techniques make this episode resemble Dario Argentoes' classic film Suspiria. From the primary and secondary hues that seem to bleed off the screen to the camera angles, this is a homage to the ""Italien Hitchcock"".
A Matter of Balance: An alien race, hoping to escape de-evolution, try to enter our dimension. The only problem is that they need people to exchange with.
Space Warp: A space warp causes Maya to become ill and to lose control of her shape-shifting powers. Changing from one life-form to the next, each is more hostile than the one before. At one point she morphs into a really cool Psychon warrior in gold armor. You also get to see more of the underground hangers beneath the launch pad. A very elaborate set with great explosions that are very realistic, loads of hardware.
The Bringers of Wonder: The only 2 part episode. Evil aliens arrive on Alpha and use mind control so that the Alphans think they are being rescued. The alphans are living in a world of virtual reality and Koenig is the only one to see through the deception. Back in the 70's virtual reality was a very new idea ,long before the Matrix came along.
And now the bonuses! We get to finally see pre-production artwork. Tons of blue prints for sets and space ships. Drawings for Maya and other aliens. There are 2 theater trailers for the 2 movies they made from the episodes, War Games and Breakaway, and The Bringers of Wonder. There is a photo gallery with behind the scenes photos, not stills from the episodes.
Then there is the BBC Behind the Scenes of Space 1999. You get to see the setting up and filming of an eagle coming up from the launch pad. Brian Johnson is shown setting up the Moonbasealpha model.
This is the dvd to own this summer, don't leave Earth without it!",1023840000,3,2741,4.618852459016393
1715147,5,B000067IVQ,"Okay, for an old Space:1999 fan that isn't the best news I've ever heard (Series 2 Lives!), but it is the best news since I heard that Series 1 was out. For those of you wondering, Space:1999 lasted for two seasons in the mid to late 1970's. Each season was a distinctly different approach to the same series, with many characters returning for Series 2, but new faces abound. And despite the fact that writing did not abound in Series 2, the quality of the acting by stars like Martin Landau make me wish that somehow, there was a Series 3 waiting for release somewhere. But, alas, this is it. The show was cancelled when it failed to sell well enough in American syndication. Just watch Landau in 'The Rules of Luton,' arguably the worst 1999 episode and you'll see what a pro he is!.
Don't expect much in the way of extras here (there are some, but nothing exceptional), but the video remastering is very good, worthy of a DVD in and of itself. And, with the eight DVD box sets released since last year, you get all of Series 1 and Series 2! Not a bad deal! And, heck, Series 2 may be ""Space:1999 Lite,"" but the elements that made this a high quality, underated, landmark television series are still present.
Lastly, you might be impressed with the quality of the sets, costumes, special effects and music if you keep it in mind that this is a 1976 production!",1023062400,7,1363,4.434262948207171

7962747,5,B000067IVQ,"Space 1999 was a diverse series that had it all and then some. It was fun like Doctor Who, as abstract as the Prisoner, as explorational as Star Trek, as light as Lost In Space, as philosophical as 2001, as dark and claustophobic as the most entertaining horror movies and disaster films, as funny as Plan 9, and it even featured pre-Star Wars space battles that were truly a blast. On it's own merit it was also quite a unique series. It was never locked down into just one pattern so it never got sterile. There are episodes for every mood and mindset. One can enjoy the serious episodes or the just plain fun escapism. The setting of 1999 only adds to the fun and the out of control moon idea was certainly original. Many episodes allow the viewer to come to one's own conclusions and there's little clear continuity after the first episode which also allows creativity on the part of the veiwer. It's a very expansive and wonderous universe that's explored in different ways. The diversity of styles and ideas are it's greatest strength. It's always a wild ride.",1138924800,2,1066,4.5863874345549736
