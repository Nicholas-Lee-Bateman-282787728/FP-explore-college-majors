3148894,5,B0015XHP4U,"First, all of these have shown on US TV over the past decades. Some have been in video and or DVD release separately before. The one I wanted had not, so I pounced on this set. Before I go on, let me say the copy quality of all four was fine to very good, no complaints. Order and delivery were a rapid process and no complaints on the condition of the product. All of the films are in black and white. And three of them deal with WWII  subjects and contain some great action stuff. One film, "" King and Country"" deals with a WWI subject, the trench trial of a British soldier accused of treason. Actors Tom Courtaney and Dirk Bogard work through a dreary set of a story better told by Stanley Kubrick in the earlier film ""Paths of Glory"" a very similar plot.
  The other three films are WWII classic plots. ""The Captive Heart"" about British POWs in German prison camps, actually filmed on location in the British zone of occupation postwar Germany.  Interesting, but a predictable end. Star is Michael Redgrave ( before he was Sir Michael).
 The next two films deal with the RAF in WWII and post war Britain. ""The Sound Barrier"" was directed in 1952 by David Lean, getting himself set up for his later greater works, about a Bridge, some guy in Arabia, and a Russian poet of sorts....on this film, David is not yet Sir David, yet we see the makings of greatness. The movie covers the experimental testing of aircraft in UK, though it could have been( and later was), set in the USA. The title was a controversy in its day, as the British did not break the sound barrier officially, and a really hokey aircraft controls situation solves the barrier problem. It does show the workings of Supermarine and Hawker-Siddley with cameras actually taken into jet engine test bays and on test flights. The star is Ralph Richardson( before the Sir was awarded), however, the opening credits state the film really stars the DH VAMPIRE, DH COMET, SUPERMARINE ATTACKER and the SPITFIRE.  And it does cover the screen with great flying shots of these then state of the art machines. This makes up for the jokiness of some of the plot. And Mr. Lean  went on to other films...
  Now, the final film. The one I bought the set for, ""Angels One Five"". Stars Jack Hawkins ( he became a Sir too, if I recall correctly) and John Gregson ( no Sir, but later married Natalie Wood, so he did good too!). The film looks at the efforts of a RAF fighter squadron during the Battle of Britain showing the physical and emotion effects on all including other base personnel and nearby townsfolk. We come to identify with all of them, drawn into their stories as well as the overall plot too. Predictable and yet surprising is how I' describe it. A satisfying program. A unique situation for the film production crew. Shooting in 1952 England, the studio could not assemble enough period correct aircraft to show a 1940 RAF  squadron. Hurricanes were leased along with flight and ground crews from the Portugese Air Force for the filming in UK, at RAF Kendley, south of London!  Spitfires were all late models and the only Hurricanes left in UK were in museums. Hawker aviation loaned their ""LAST OF THE MANY"" final Hurricane built, so the film was shot with five fly able Hurricanes and a few gate guards as set dressers!
  These films underscore that a movie does not have to be a wide screen, multibucks spent, full color blockbuster to be memorable, interesting, and entertaining.",1380758400,3,3452,4.575364667747164
3148895,5,B0015XHP4U,"This collection is a good transcript from the Uk. The jewel in the crown is the "" Sound Barrier"" but all are good. You gotta love the bit where actor Nigel Patrick says "" piece of cake"" - brilliant! Second favorite is Angels one Five.

3148896,5,B0015XHP4U,"These were all enjoyable clasic. Even though the acting at times was some what 'woody' this was easy to overlook because for me the main action stars were the machines (aircraft in particular)that only a few years earlier were engaged in world conflict, resulting in them being close to their orginal operational configuration.

I was very pleased to find out that all the films are excellent: great set for WW2 movie lovers. The quality of the transfers is excellent, again something I was not expecting. Apparently they have been digitally restored by Studio Canal +: great picture and excellent, clean sound.

Captive Heart is the only one I have seen.  It is very well done.  Michael Redgrave portrays an concentration camp escapee impersonating a dead British soldier.
