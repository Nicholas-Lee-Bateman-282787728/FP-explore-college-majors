4661383,2,B005DOSIBQ,"[China and Sex - 1994 - directed by Joe D'Amato (using the name Robert Yip) - 90 minutes - Full Frame] MYA's DVD for China and Sex is a typically mediocre affair from the label whose name is an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience'. It features a sub-par full frame transfer that looks no better than it might have on VHS. There's plenty of damage to the print and no restoration was even attempted. The film is fuzzy overall, lacks contrast of any kind and the colors are decidedly washed out. The two-channel mono sound isn't much to celebrate, but it's better than the image. Dialogue is clear enough, but any music or background noise is too diminished to really notice. And, typical of MYA, there are no extras. Predictable MYA fodder, abusive to those who purchase their products, which has become more than tedious through time (read my other reviews of MYA'S travesties, as I'm tired of trashing their releases here on Amazon).

Content wise, this film echoes many of the themes that D'Amato explored in his similarly-themed and equally awful film 'Chinese Kamasutra', which he also did under the name Robert Yip. The plot revolves around a dancer named Tama, who works at a sleazy brothel, but is unattainable unlike the other girls there (how does this work? You're there to make money and degrade yourself in the process, right? Am I missing something regarding the rules of engagement in such an establishment?). She is not the type of woman that money can buy; in fact the only way in which someone gets to spend the night with her is if they are chosen by her. Enter a wealthy man who sets his sights on her, only to be spurned time and time again. It is only when he is willing to let everything he has go that she finally picks him. Unfortunately what he seeks may not be what he is ultimately looking for. Let's just say that pleasure and pain goes hand in hand when it comes to conquering Tama. The erection-eradicating and shocking ending is the film's only merit, if you could call it that, but most of you will have drifted off long before it arrives. Oh Joe, what have ye done to us now?

People who actively seek out the films of Joe D'Amato have no real reason to skip 'China and Sex', but it's weaknesses are apparent from the get go. When Joe has his heart in a flick, the results can be surprising. That isn't the case here; the same can be said of any of his films from the 90's (except his hardcore flicks, which were far better than any of his soft-core sleep-aids from this period). It's worse than most of his work and features some very unintentionally funny, ultra-pretentious dialogue. It's a terrible movie by any employable standard of calibration, even by low-rent exploitation standards, and everybody else should definitely skip it. Save your coin and order Chinese take-out instead.",1360368000,7,2821,4.617529880478088

Good little movie  - glad to see it on DVD.",1355270400,,166,4.03030303030303
4661385,3,B005DOSIBQ,"The one and only reason to see this one may be Gene Tierney in her early prime, but the story is a hodgepodge.  I agree with the other reviewer that Montgomery plays his part like a Clark Gable wannabee and comes off looking less than the part.  The supporting cast does a fairly good job of trying to keep the story interesting but the mostly annoying performance of Montgomery keeps this only a middle of the road film.  There are some good special effects and action at times but the story lacks the punch of other films that use the ""woman gets guy to committ to effort in wartime"" theme.  See ""This Above All"" with Tyrone Power and Joan Fontaine for how it should be done.",1346457600,7,677,4.349206349206349

4661387,3,B005DOSIBQ,"In the month before the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, a photographer (George Montgomery) and a soldier of fortune (Victor McLaglen) escape from a Japanese prison in China. The Japanese are eager to recapture the photographer as he mistakenly took a notebook with information on the impending Pearl Harbor attack. Directed by Henry Hathaway (TRUE GRIT) from a screenplay by Ben Hecht (NOTORIOUS), this is an unexceptional WWII propaganda piece gussied up with a romance between Montgomery and a Eurasian girl (Gene Tierney). I think she's Eurasian because she has a Chinese father (Philip Ahn) but no attempt is made to make her look Asian. The film casually features some unpleasant racial aspersions, one character complains ""What's wrong with this buck toothed babes, they always play hard to get!"". That's one of the milder smears. While Tierney is always a welcome presence, Montgomery's brash performance becomes tedious after awhile. The score is an early effort by Hugo Friedhofer (BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES). With Lynn Bari as the ""bad"" girl who turns good for the hero, Myron McCormick, Sig Ruman and a young Robert Blake (IN COLD BLOOD) as the Hindu boy Montgomery takes under his wing.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a decent transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio. Audio is either English or Spanish with optional subtitles.",1323820800,6,1337,5.077272727272727

8467290,3,B005DOSIBQ,"""China Girl"" is war time propaganda. With a somewhat confusing screenplay by Daryl Zanuck using his pseudonym of Melville Crossman, the film appeared after Pearl Harbour and thereby focuses on the Japanese and the destruction they inflicted on China. The film stars George Montgomery who sounds like Clark Gable and looks like John Payne. His part is that of the anti-hero who Gable often played and Montgomery does OK.  The screenplay is full of holes really but that is not the point. There is plenty of action and enough confusion to keep the audience on their toes. Montgomery is supported by Victor McLaglan and Lyn Bari who are very good. In fact, Bari is outstanding and much much better than Gene Tierney who looks a treat as always but is subdued to the point of inertia. She plays the title role as an American educated daughter of a chinaman.

The film has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives series which means no extras, no scene selection, no nothing.  While the print is not restored, it is OK and preserves the outstanding photography for which Fox was renowned at this time.",1451865600,,1094,4.717277486910994
8467291,4,B005DOSIBQ,"Henry Hathaway is no slouch and it shows.  Montgomery does fine with a tough-guy persona, and he doesn't overdo it; I think my fellow reviewers are a little hypercritical in this regard.  TIerney also good.  I liked the comment, ""the Japanese can take Burma whenever they want""...which is what they did in 1942.",1444608000,,311,4.830188679245283
8467292,2,B005DOSIBQ,"Gene Tierney is a lovely mannequin. But, she seems incapable of expressing real emotion, even in supposed love scenes. The lead rogue character and later hero of the story is poorly played by George Montgomery (he's no Errol Flynn). Victor McLaglen does his usual good work as one of the movie villains but he gets little to no help from the rest of the cast.
 A dull script and lackluster direction don't help this very disappointing film!!!",1438905600,,442,4.740259740259741
8467293,5,B005DOSIBQ,"What a terrific movie. Anything with Gene Tierney was bound to be a hit. A 1940's movie in fantastic black and white. I have wanted this movie for a very long time. Last night I watched it as part of a double feature with another movie that I have wanted for a very long time, China with Alan Ladd and the beautiful Loretta Young. Having lived in Los Angeles for twenty six years before moving to the beautiful pacific northwest I recognized the famous Bradbury Building that doubled as the hotel in the movie.",1428537600,3,510,4.4361702127659575
