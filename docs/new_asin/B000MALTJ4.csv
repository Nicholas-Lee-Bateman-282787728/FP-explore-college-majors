8167571,5,B000MALTJ4,Even better then American Mormon. They learned from the first one and improved the product! The interviews with non LDS were again fun to watch and see the lack of knowledge people have about LDS but the interviews with European LDS blew me away. The devotion and faith they have as exhibited by the effort they need to make to go to Temple is inspiring. The stories about Berlin and the Wall both before and after the fall made me cry. A great follow up to American Mormon but easily stands on it's own as a inspirational picture! Great work guy's!,1237075200,2,549,4.445544554455446
