8425560,5,B004DL0R50,"Love it. I look at it over and over. Learned much from it.
I would like a second DVD on step by step micro macrame necklaces using a slightly
thicker cord; for example 1mm cord. It would still fall under the heading of micro-macrame.
This DVD is worth having as a beginner.",1426204800,,273,4.269230769230769
8425561,5,B004DL0R50,"It was everything I hoped it would be!  I've watched it several times because there is so much to learn from it.  I also practiced the knots as I watched, & of course, paused it whenever I needed to.  So glad I bought it.  I will certainly look for more from Joan Babcock.",1410307200,2,272,4.0754716981132075
8425562,5,B004DL0R50,I have purchased both of Joan Babcock's books and there was information in the DVD that helped me alot.  I believe this DVD would stand on it's own - without buying her books.,1391472000,5,175,4.303030303030303
8425563,4,B004DL0R50,"One of the few books I could find on Cavendola.  Well written and illistrated.
Great for beginner or advanced knowledge.",1366848000,7,120,5.0
8425564,5,B004DL0R50,"While I prefer books so I can quickly access info I'm looking for, it also doesn't hurt to have someone explain the step by step basics of micro-macrame.  I'm a beginner and I found a wealth of information along with Ms. Babcock's great explanations.  She uses larger cord for the demonstrations so you can easily see just how each knot is formed.  A must have tool for anyone interested in learning this craft.",1360368000,11,411,4.602739726027397
8425565,5,B004DL0R50,This is a beautifully done DVD with easy to follow instructions.  This is great for anyone who does macrame and wants to take it to another level.,1353974400,9,146,4.407407407407407
