2502457,5,B000E6FVVI,"This is essential viewing for drummers at all levels to fine tune technique and relaxation. In particular, matched and traditional grip, natural stick motion and accenting are covered in detail. Also a good section on buzz rolls. Morello's dry humor adds entertainment value. Maybe more on double strokes would have been useful.",1167868800,4,328,5.326923076923077
2502458,2,B000E6FVVI,"Unfourtunately, after the anticipation was over. I started into the program and found it never really got moving. It was nice to see Joe talk about things and demonstrate some things, but it didn't meet my expectations of Joe Morello. Thought he would of been more technical. For a begineer this could be a good DVD.",1153267200,2,316,4.660714285714286
8106766,2,B000E6FVVI,"If you are an absolute beginner, this could be useful, but WAY to short",1445990400,,71,4.142857142857143
8106767,1,B000E6FVVI,"Mr. Morello never took off his sunglasses the whole time he was giving ""instruction.""  His use of the English language was rather poor. His hands were all over the place making gestures that had nothing to do with drumming technique.  The tone of his voice and flippant attitude made me, the viewer, feel the whole time he was talking down to me.  There was nothing here of any value.  I learned so much more from the DVDs by Tommy Igoe.  I returned this DVD and got charged a hefty re-stocking fee by the vendor - avoid this trashy, useless DVD.",1433289600,,546,4.42
8106768,5,B000E6FVVI,"One of the most innovative drummers of all time, and a good and patient instructor. I started drumming late, at 45, and this video has improved my abilities immensely.",1426550400,,167,4.793103448275862
8106769,5,B000E6FVVI,"Includes a slow motion feature so you can better see the arm, hand and finger manipulation of the drumsticks.",1405468800,,109,4.7894736842105265
8106770,5,B000E6FVVI,"Joe has a casual and fun approach in this video. He's old but he's still got IT! I'm relatively new to drumming so I'm sucking in every tip and technique I can to find my own way. My father was buying and listening to Dave Brubeck records all through my childhood, now I know who Dave's drummer was.

I did learn some things from this video which justified the cost in my mind. It's not the worlds best but I like the casual style they used to produce this, that makes it fun to watch and informative.

Good luck and good music to all.",1388188800,,535,4.134615384615385
8106771,3,B000E6FVVI,"I thought I'd get more for my money!  Joe spends most of the DVD with the basics, far too basic for my taste as I'm been playing over 50 years.  It was a great review of ""fundamentals"" ... ""rudimental"" is a better description. It was strange seeing and listening to Joe now that he's old like me.  I was in Jr. High when Brubeck released Take Five (from the LP, Time Out); and worn out my record, yes ""record"" ... still have it and still love it.  But only buy this instructional CD if you have extra cash and really love Joe Morello ... or if you're a beginner.  Buy it for a young drummer and impress on him or her that they, first and foremost, need a good foundation in rudiments and how to use their body as well as their hands.",1377129600,,733,4.0979020979020975
8106772,5,B000E6FVVI,"Reviewer Derek Warren's description of this video is spot on. I would like to add a few other considerations that I hope will set your expectations.

First, Joe Morello's on-camera teaching style can be frustrating because he is whips through each lesson quickly. However, you can replay any segment of lesson as often as necessary, and Joe does provide a constant stream of advice and tips that - if you heed them and actually put them to use - will dramatically improve your technique.

Second, this is NOT a video to be watched from start to finish without interruption. Watch it one exercise at a time, breaking at the end of each exercise to actually perform the exercises, and repeat until you feel that you are comfortable with, and have met the objectives of, each exercise before proceeding to the next. Then, incorporate those exercises into your personal practice regimen. This may not sound like much fun (and at first it isn't), but it does build muscle-memory, which means that the techniques and exercise objectives are incorporated into your own playing, which is why you purchased this video in the first place, right?

Finally, regardless of your level of proficiency or ingrained style with respect to grip and technique, if you follow the exercises and work at employing the techniques Joe teaches, you can ""unlearn"" any bad habits you bring to the lessons and exercises. For example, I started playing in 1964, took a long break from drumming, and took it up again years later. I brought a plethora of bad habits and questionable technique, all of which I was able to rectify through diligently following the lessons and exercises presented here, and the hard work and frustration that entailed. I personally think it paid off significantly, making this one of the most invaluable instructional videos I had the good sense to purchase (and work through).

Complaints about the instructional style and pacing have some validity, but if you look beyond those and dig in and take the lessons to heart (and work through the exercises), this video can and probably will make a big difference in your abilities as a drummer. After all, your instructor is one of the top drummers ever, and is no longer with us to give personal lessons, so this is as close as you are going to get to unlocking the secrets to Joe's amazing technique.",1334793600,8,2347,4.830845771144278
8106773,3,B000E6FVVI,"Honestly, this video was ok.  I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of content.  Now, what he talks about is certainly important (different strokes, relaxed technique, etc), but most of it can be gathered without the video.  If you are just starting to drum, these might be good foundational instructions.  I would probably just recommend going to watch the videos at vicfirth.com.",1221609600,4,387,5.0
8106774,4,B000E6FVVI,"If you're looking for a flashy video packed with drum solos, don't go here (although, the couple of video clips of Joe with Brubeck are awsome).

But this DVD is more profound than it might first appear...to the casual viewer. If you think about it for just a moment, the way you grip your drum sticks actually determines your ability to make music. Anybody can grab a stick and bang on a drum; two-year-olds are especially adept at it. But to articulate real music is a completely different game. Joe shows you the ""magic"" used by himself and dozens of the greats (both past and present) that seem to bring the sticks to life.

Speed, be it slow or fast, and accuracy of note placement (in short, controlling the stick and it's bounce) are paramount to playing a groove, swinging, or playing ""in the pocket"". Joe breaks down the elements of an effective grip, as well as forearm and wrist motion, and then articulates the use of the fingers in the over-all stroke. If you can resist the urge for flashy, fast, and convoluted playing, and study meticulously  the form Joe is showing you (I found some fascinating secrets by advancing the movie frame by frame), and then work on it every day, it won't be but a few months before you notice a marked difference in your ability to play.

My only complaint is that I wanted more. I have many more questions now than when I started watching, but then isn't that a sign of good teaching? That Joe has got me thinking more deeply about my grip? For example, I wish Joe would have gone a little deeper in to when to use the index finger and when not to use the index finger in the left hand of the traditional grip. I think I got my answer by watching him, but he didn't address it much.

Short of those nitpicking points, any drummer who wants to play more musically today should start with studying Joe's DVD. Consider that Steve Smith and Dave Weckl, two formidable players today (regardless of whether you ""like"" their playing or not) both speak often of having studied with Freddie Gruber. What did they learn from Freddie? Maybe lots of stuff, but what both of those players mention is how much Freddie's teaching affected their grip and how their grip affected their over-all ability to play.

Watch Joe closley, practice it, and then start swinging!",1181692800,21,2299,4.554479418886198
8106775,5,B000E6FVVI,I would highly recommend this DVD as an excellent learning tool in basic drumming rudiment technique and style. Joe explains it in an easy to follow and relaxed manner.,1173312000,3,168,4.827586206896552
