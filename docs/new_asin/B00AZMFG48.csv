5532953,5,B00AZMFG48,"I'm actually watching this film right now and it truly sickens and disturbs me more than any documentary ever has.  What is even more disturbing than this film is that the city of New York has refused to compensate these men at all for destroying and stealing their lives and for destroying their families.  Elizabeth Lederer knew good and well that none of these juveniles were guilty, she knew their confessions were coerced, she knew there was no DNA evidence because they were not guilty, but they were expendable to her, and so she moved forward with the destruction of their spirits.  She continues to practice law and actually teaches at Columbia University today without a shred of apology or regret. This film will disturb you to the very core and it is a fantastic visual of racism and injustice in America.",1366070400,2,817,4.73943661971831
5532954,5,B00AZMFG48,"Let's see.  So five 14 year old boys...children are summarily railroaded and convicted of a rape and assault of a white woman.  Vilified by the press and Mayor Kotch, convicted in the media before they were even arranged -- these five boys who had never met before spent the better part of 14 years in jail for a crime they didn't commit.  Tantamount to the narratives of stolen innocence Burns delicately weaves in the stories of the youths families.  Adding yet another layer with deft delicate strokes Burns documents the inhuman illegalities perpetuated by the NYC Police Department in the ""case of the century,"" as Kotch called it.  Taking unfair advantage of Black and Hispanic children was and as Burns skillfully exposes, still is business as usual.  Under the umbrella of a racist political hierarchy that starts with the Mayor's office a systematic racist assures the perpetuation of unethical practices in the District Attorneys office and the law enforcement agencies.

This is a horror movie and if you are not white--the monster will get you.  Forget about Freddie Kruger, NYC is the sick psycho killer that captures and kills 14 year-old Black boys and returns them as the walking dead.  Shame on YOU!",1365724800,,1216,4.9507389162561575
5532955,1,B00AZMFG48,"Let me start out by saying that I to think they were innocent, but, Mr. Burns really lets the viewers down here.  Any good documentarian does not have his mind made while starting work on a good documentary, unfortunately Burns did not attempt to do any digging he only wanted create an opinion piece.  I'd also like to mention the recreation scenes in this film are almost laughable, with the burning amateurish cigarettes and ticking wall clock, etc.  Furthermore,I was literally gobsmacked by the inclusion of so called journalist Jim Dwyer in this film.  Mr. Dwyer goes through an important chronology that shows these boys could not have been guilty.  Yet, where was Mr. Dwyer he in the 80's or 90's? The answer is he was part of the problem.  Dwyer is a well known opportunist, and also jumped on the bandwagon with the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case.  Along with Fairstein and Lederer, Dwyer and his profession is partially responsible for the suffering of these boys.  The media hoopla at the time was unparalleled and they should be forced to pay damages.
All in all this documentary was poor.",1365292800,28,1095,4.756613756613756
5532956,5,B00AZMFG48,"My initial reaction to reading the Turfseer review of this film was a belief, based on the errors and the distortion of facts in the review,that the reviewer saw a different film from the one I saw or was merely ignorant of the truth because he didn't understand the film..  A closer reading leads me to believe that something more serious, perhaps even sinister, is afoot here: a deliberate attempt to mislead those without direct unbiased knowledge of the events discussed in the film, and to advance the unsupported theories and suppositions of some of those directly involved in the original miscarriage of justice.

To wit: Turfseer writes  ( I shall hereafter include Turfseer's accounts in quotes and my answers below them):

""the Central Park Five (CPF) were not only convicted of rape (in most cases) but also assaulting other people in the park that night. Burns and the CPF want you to believe that they merely observed two serious assaults in the park and acted 'shocked' by the brutality of the mob.""

They were NOT convicted of assaulting specific ""other people"", because, as the prosecutor, Elizabeth Lederer, admitted in her own opening statement to the jury in the initial trials, none of the ""other"" people assaulted in the park could identify their assailants among the five accused teenagers (let Truthseekers as opposed to Turfseers consult the film and public records to back up the assertions I make here) and that the only witnesses against them were their proximity, i.e. being in the park at the same time, and their own confessions which they asserted had been coerced and tricked out of them, and which they had by the time of the trial repudiated.

'Burns trots out the five victims who all seem fairly articulate and reasonable as they recount their stories from their perspective as adults.""

One of those ""articulate"" victims has an IQ of 70 and a hearing disability. (Burns mentions this in the film) Only one of the five at the time of their arrest had attained his 16th birthday and all were initially questioned without the presence of legal guardians or counsel. This is also covered in the film.  One wonders how ""articulate"" as Turfseer describes them, these frightened boys were then.(The NYPD would not make its video and written records available to the film makers)  All the defendants testified in the film that they were bullied and terrified of the police who questioned them and assured them that if they ""cooperated as witnesses"" they could go home. If Turfseer finds them so ""reasonable,"" at the point of their initial questioning as frightened and confused youths, why then does he proceed to question their adult assertions of innocence now.

""at his PAROLE HEARING, Raymond Santana (one of the CPF) denied the rape but READILY ADMITTED that he and seven or eight of his friends planned to go to the park to rob and assault people. He also admitted that they let one man go because he was with his girlfriend and also admitted (he himself) had beat a man.""

All of the five say they were coerced into admitting participation in the other crimes committed in the park that night, and though I have no specific proof of the fact, I suspect they had not gone into the park that night to conduct prayer services.  Unlike Turfseer, however, I am unwilling to draw conclusions about the fives' innocence or guilt based solely on my or anyone else's speculations and syurmises.
It should also be noted that at PAROLE HEARINGS steadfast refusal to admit to the crimes for which you have been convicted counts against your chances of being paroled. Did Turfseer not know this when highlighting the parole hearing above, or simply believe that others would not? Either speaks ill of Turfseer's probity and thoroughness.  Remember this when reading Turfseer's other parole testimony analyses.

""Numerous accomplices implicated all five defendants""

Name them. Raymond Santana stated he had counted 33 boys going into the park that night. In such a group you could only be certain of the presence of people you knew. Collectively, it has been asserted, the ""CPF"" knew six to nine other boys in the initial group, and none well.  So far as I have been able to ascertain, only two of these others have implicated any of the ""CPF"" and none has implicated them all.  If Turfseer has superior proven information on this, I'd be glad to have it..

""Another fact about the case that Burns conveniently ignores is that only two of the CPF, Richardson and Santana, were actually arrested in the park. How is it, that the other three were eventually linked to the two found in the park? Long before the alleged 'coercion' during the DA interviews, there was obvious PROBABLE CAUSE to arrest the other three. That's because when police initially encountered the mob of kids, only Santana (and separately charged Stephen Lopez), remained at the scene. They were observed to be 'wide-eyed' and in 'shock'. Richardson fled and was apprehended. On the way to the precinct, Richardson (and another youth, Clarence Thomas) both fingered McCray as the 'murderer'. Statements by Richardson and others implicated both Santana and Lopez as being part of the mob. Later, the other three were linked by Richardson and Santana, as well as other witnesses, to each other.""

I am not sure of the point of this paragraph. The Five all testified that they were coerced FROM THE BEGINNING into implicating others and that the only others they could specifically implicate were others they knew. Burns does not ignore this but uses it and the language of the statements made to show how the teenagers had been coached by the police. As to ""wide eyed and in shock"" why would they not be upon being accosted by police on leaving the park where they had witnessed - or participated in - any of what was going on there?

""Judge Galligan found, except for one instance, there were no grounds to suppress any of the statements or evidence taken from the statements.""

Judge Thomas Galligan's choice by the prosecution represent's one of the more tawdry and abusive aspects of this whole affair, both in the manner of its occurrence and the reason for the same.  Normally a criminal trial judge, to avoid the appearance and possibility of bias, is chosen by turning a wheel with names in it and assigning the case to whatever Judge whose name comes out.  In the case of the ""CPF"", the administrative judges of the Criminal Courts, as they had every legal right to do but rarely did, directed the initial hearing Judge to give the case to Judge Thomas Galligan specifically. Judge Galligan was known throughout New York City's criminal justice community as a ""prosecutor's judge"" for his tendency to favor the prosecution. In fact so many of the inmates at Riker's Island, the city's huge jail facility, had been sent there by Judge Galligan, that they often referred to it as ""Galligan's Island"".  This choice greatly enhanced the chances of prosecutorial misconduct and conviction by a prosecution that had no physical evidence linking the accused to the crimes and no eyewitnesses except the statements of the accused themselves which they had now repudiated.

""If Burns is guilty of the sin of omission, he's on far shakier ground when he asserts as fact, that there was some kind of 'time line' that contradicted the police and DA version of events. The Findlaw report concluded otherwise: ""In fact, no accurate time line can be constructed because the evidence regarding the timing of the various events and the individuals who participated in them is not sufficiently precise to allow any exact conclusion.""

What exactly ""the Findlaw report"" is I cannot say. ""Findlaw"" is an online site for legal professionals.  I could not find nor do I know of any report the site issued on the ""CPF"" but unhappily for Turfseer,  the evidence he cites favors the defense not the prosecution, as anyone closely examining the case would know, for it was the prosecution, not the defense, that presented a particular timeline that was argued to be inconclusive at best and contradictory at worst. This was argued initially by the defense and then later by the New York City District Attorney's investigation into the weakness of THEIR original case, and the apparent validity of Reyes' confession.

Reyes' confession, in addition to the presence of his DNA on the jogger and none of that of the accused, included details not released to the press OR DISCUSSED WITH THE CPF. The five other rapes for which Reyes had been convicted (three of which occurred after that of the Central Park jogger's) were similar in their method and details to the each other and the jogger's.  This is the kind of evidence that would normally represent a slam-dunk in a criminal prosecution, and is the dream of those who capture and try criminals.  In this case however the police, the prosecutors, the media, and the Turfseers of the world all had varying vested interests in sustaining the original miscarriage of justice.  The prosecutors, to their credit, followed the dictates of the law, even when it seemed to indict and convict their own office's original conduct of the case.  The police, who could be held responsible for  permitting the rape and murder of others while focusing on and pursuing the wrongly accused, could not.  The media, and the Turfseers of the world, in varying and sundry degrees, have not fully resigned to what the DA's investigation found and did to rectify what appears to have been a monstrous error.

In addition, neither the Police Department's competing investigation of its conduct of the case nor any of the articles written by the original prosecutors or their defenders has ever found a specific and definitive error of fact or law in the report the District Attorney's office issued upon vacating all the convictions of the Central park Five.  Even if the DA had decided to let the non-rape charges stand, they could not in either law, or justice keep the five  behind bars,  because once any part of their confessions was shown to be tainted, the whole became insubstantial, and the time they would have received for any of the other charged offenses had already been  well more than served .
The film is not the in-depth examination one would need to dismiss the biased and insubstantial record of the Turfseer case view presented here.  For that one would need to examine the records of the case available to the public, or short of that, read the more in-depth companion book to the film.

In closing, I should explain, why I have taken so much time with this revie:

Before the exoneration and release of the CPF, I was a firm believer in the basic fairness and rectitude of the American system of justice.  There might be the odd slip-up or act of police misconduct from time to time. This I was willing to overlook for the sake of better overall societal security, but I did not believe, until seeing this film and researching this case the routine criminality and incompetence of many law enforcement personnel or the callousness and compromised integrity of much of the criminal justice system and those who administer it.

Further, I was a firm believer in the death penalty for acts of murder, a life for a life.

Finally, I believed the five guilty and quoted Oscar Wilde to my correspondents at the time, ""It was for sinners such as this, Hell was created bottomless"".

By God's grace, or the luck of the draw, I was in no position to have sent these boys to their deaths, for I should have done so with a clear conscience, and having done so should not have been able to live comfortably with myself for the rest of my life. I no longer support the death penalty, not even when in the depths of my heart, I might believe myself capable of executing it. Men, their judgmens, and their institutions are fallible, and while a wrongful death may compensate one's heirs, death itself cannot be reprieved or repealed.

I urge all to see tis film, read the companion book to it, and whatever other public records to which you may have access, then make up your own minds.

N.B. There is no such thing as a ""Finlaw Report"" What Turfseer refers to as such is just the ""Executive Summary of  New York City Police Departmen's examination of its policies and procedures in light of the Central Park jogger case"" It's the NYPD's self-exoneration in the wake of the New York City Districtt Attorney's re-examination of the case after Reyes' confession.  It is just published on the Findlaw site, an on-line site for legal professionals. One wonders why Turfseer didn't present it as it is,for what it is instead of giving it a phony name that hides its nature and purpose.",1360195200,76,12689,4.813707451701932
5532957,4,B00AZMFG48,"In late 2011, Sarah Burns published the ""Central Park Five"" book, and in late, 2012, the documentary based on this book, or perhaps more accurately stated, made in conjunction with this book, was released in the theatre (I saw it at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington DC about a month ago). This co-documentary is directed by the book's author as well as David McMahon and Ken Burns (yes, that Ken Burns).

""The Central Park Five"" (120 min.) brings in excruciating (but riveting and enraging) details the background of the infamous ""Central Park jogger"" case of a woman who was savagely attacked, raped and left for dead while jogging in New York's Central Park in 1989. By coincidence that very same evening a bunch of black and latino 14 and 15 yr. old teenagers were hanging out in Central Park and pretty quickly the New York police rounded up a number of them, eventually causing 5 of them to admit to a crime they did not commit. This of course then goes to the very heart of this documentary: why did the 5 innocent teenagers confess to a crime they did not commit? Just watch!

Several comments: first and foremost, this documentary is clearly the result of painstaking background work into the details of the case. The initial part of the documentary does a great job setting the table of what New York was like in the late 80s (pre-law and order days of Rudolph Giuliani's administration in the 90s). The documentary also gives some amazing insights on why the media were not more thorough and critical while covering the case and the trial (one of the interviewees is a New York Times reporter who basically admits that 'we failed to do our job'). Also appalling is the dumbfounding absence of a strong legal defense during the trial, when not a single lawyer for the defendants points out that it was physically impossible for the teenagers to be at the spot of the crime when the crime happened. And on and on. This movie is gathering strong buzz, and hence I was surprised that it did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary. Nevertheless, ""The Central Park Five"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1358726400,66,2117,4.672922252010724
5532958,2,B00AZMFG48,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'The Central Park Five' is noted documentarian Ken Burns' take on the infamous arrest, subsequent trial and eventual legal exoneration of five minority youths accused in the assault and rape of a Central Park jogger in 1989. It's Burns' position that in a haste to make arrests, the investigating detectives and representatives from the NYC DA's office, 'force fed' their own versions of events and 'coerced' the youths to make statements implicating themselves, both in written and (in some of the defendants' cases) videotaped confessions. Burns is also satisfied with the confession of serial killer Matias Reyes, who claimed he acted alone and whose DNA was linked directly to the Central Park jogger.

  For those looking for easy answers, 'The Central Park Five' upon first glance seems to tie things up quite nicely, making the case that the five youths were victims not only of a police and DA's office 'rush to judgment', but of being victims of the racism endemic in society as a whole. Burns trots out the five victims who all seem fairly articulate and reasonable as they recount their stories from their perspective as adults.

  One of the problems that Burns fails to explore in enough detail is that the Central Park Five (CPF) were not only convicted of rape (in most cases) but also assaulting other people in the park that night. Burns and the CPF want you to believe that they merely observed two serious assaults in the park and acted 'shocked' by the brutality of the mob. The CPF all insisted during the documentary, that they were not guilty and that's why they all refused to accept a plea bargain from the DA's office prior to trial. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1994, at his PAROLE HEARING, Raymond Santana (one of the CPF) denied the rape but READILY ADMITTED that he and seven or eight of his friends planned to go to the park to rob and assault people. He also admitted that they let one man go because he was with his girlfriend and also admitted (he himself) had beat a man.

  When Anton McCray went before the parole board, in November 1994, he also admitted all the crimes in the park except the rape. In 2002, Kevin Richardson and Santana were interviewed by detectives and they both admitted their participation in the assaults but not the rapes. Just as an example, 23 people were identified as participating on the assault of a victim, Antonio Diaz in the park. Numerous accomplices implicated all five defendants; both Richardson and McCray admitted participation and Salaam and Wise, admitted being present and Santana observed some ""commotion"" in the distance. Not a word from Burns on these facts as it's clear he doesn't want to tarnish the image of the Central Park Five, as it looks a lot better if they're depicted as total and complete victims and not individuals who might be capable of violence. Of course some will say, even if the Central Park Five committed assaults, it doesn't make them rapists. But Burns doesn't even let on that the CPF might be guilty of ANYTHING!

  Another fact about the case that Burns conveniently ignores is that only two of the CPF, Richardson and Santana, were actually arrested in the park. How is it, that the other three were eventually linked to the two found in the park? Long before the alleged 'coercion' during the DA interviews, there was obvious PROBABLE CAUSE to arrest the other three. That's because when police initially encountered the mob of kids, only Santana (and separately charged Stephen Lopez), remained at the scene. They were observed to be 'wide-eyed' and in 'shock'. Richardson fled and was apprehended. On the way to the precinct, Richardson (and another youth, Clarence Thomas) both fingered McCray as the 'murderer'. Statements by Richardson and others implicated both Santana and Lopez as being part of the mob. Later, the other three were linked by Richardson and Santana, as well as other witnesses, to each other.

  In watching 'The Central Park Five', you'll get the distinct impression that the defendants were 'railroaded'; that there was no opportunity for them to dispute their allegations that the initial arrest was invalid, their statements were obtained by trickery or outright deception, the Family Court Act and Criminal Procedure Law provisions mandating parental notification and presence during questioning were not followed, false promises were made that they would be released, physical force was used and they were deprived of food and sleep. In reality, there was a six week pre-trial hearing involving testimony from twenty-nine prosecution witnesses, testimony from Wise, Richardson, Santana and Salaam, Lopez, parents, siblings, relatives and friends of the defendants. Judge Galligan found, except for one instance, there were no grounds to suppress any of the statements or evidence taken from the statements. You can read about all the motions the defense submitted in their attempt to suppress evidence and why almost all of their motions failed. It's chronicled in this special report at Findlaw.com commissioned by the Police Commissioner for the purpose of determining whether the new evidence indicated that police supervisors or officers acted improperly or incorrectly: news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/cpjgr/nypd12703jgrrpt.pdf.

  Despite all the claims during the documentary that the CPF were ""coerced"", only Kharey Wise claimed he was ""fed"" answers. As the prosecutor pointed out during the trial, ""McCray testified that the police said he should put himself in it, and that was all the information that was given to Antron McCray about what he was supposed to put in his statement."" If Burns is guilty of the sin of omission, he's on far shakier ground when he asserts as fact, that there was some kind of 'time line' that contradicted the police and DA version of events. The Findlaw report concluded otherwise: ""In fact, no accurate time line can be constructed because the evidence regarding the timing of the various events and the individuals who participated in them is not sufficiently precise to allow any exact conclusion.""

There's plenty more in the report commissioned by the Police Department including collaboration by outside witnesses (and not just the defendants themselves), that the CPF were involved in the assault on the jogger.  One such witness, Melody Jackson, was a sister of one of Kharey Wises' friends, Corey. After the pre-trial hearing, she told the police that she was at her sister's house when she took a call from Wise from Riker's Island, who admitted that he held the jogger's legs down while Richardson sexually assaulted her.  Jackson thought this information would be helpful to Wise (obviously unaware that by placing Wise at the scene, he could be charged with rape).  Not only did she testify at the trial but in 2002, she re-confirmed her statement.  Jackson also explained that by inculpating Wise, it had a negative effect on her for the rest of her life (her community obviously regarded her as a 'traitor').  Here is somebody who had everything to lose by telling the truth about what Wise told her, but she continued to stick to her story, even years later!

  'The Central Park Five' is the 'Mickey Mouse' version of what happened. In reality, the entire story is extremely complex. Read the report at the Findlaw site if you're interested in DETAILS. Otherwise, watch Burns' sanitized version. A civil lawsuit is still pending, with all defendants seeking compensation. If they can prove their case, they deserve all the compensation in the world. Let the chips fall where they may.

UPDATE: New York City's left-leaning Mayor has now given the Central Park Five the payday they were looking for.  Doubts still remain.  Significantly the NY Post reported this in their 6-20-14 edition: In 2002, a judge granted a motion to vacate the 13-year-old convictions after a serial rapist who was already in jail said he committed the crime, a confession backed up by DNA evidence. The Wall Street Journal, however, reported Thursday that two doctors who treated Meili said in recent interviews that some of her wounds were not consistent with Matias Reyes' account of the attack. The revelation castes doubt on the claim that Reyes was the only attacker.",1358640000,68,8286,5.033625730994152

What those cops did was an absolute CRIME!!! They didn't really say it in the documentary... they just touched on it... that the same cop who caught the real rapist/murderer/monster was working both cases! THEY F'n KNEW THOSE KIDS DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT CRIME!! They just manufactured a perpetrator (5 of them) to satisfy the public! The cops were the real monsters!! Those kids were 14-15 years old!!! Never been in any trouble! That's what really hurt them... If they were even just a little bit street smart they would've know to NEVER trust or talk to the police. I bet they rounded up most of those 25 kids who were out there that night... apparently 20 of them KNEW to ask for lawyers or to never implicate themselves in some story just to go home!! They didn't say it but the kids who went home that first night were probably real troublesome kids that KNEW that the cops were not to be trusted. THOSE COPS PREYED ON THOSE 5 KIDS!!

The irony of the whole story is that it wasn't some great effort by some legendary journalist that brought the truth out... IT WAS THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ACTUAL RAPIST/MURDERER that brought the truth to light!!! Shame!!! If anyone if familiar with the ""How to make a murderer"" saga.... this is Exactly that!! Intimidation coercion and Conspiracy by the police on helpless Innocent law abiding citizens!!! Its bigger than racism... Its a disgrace!!

As black people we are taught at a very young age to Never trust the police. These kids and their parents, journalists, and the general public were all duped by the police Dept.!!

How could a man treat a woman in the way the jogger was attacked? What made this man a rapist? And what about the other crimes these five committed? How did that play into their arrest? Would these acts have escalated to something worse, such as this incident?

The case was a grave miscarriage of justice, and the volatile atmosphere along with the crushing effects this case had on the lives of the wrongly accused and their families are captured very well.

Unfortunately, the documentary moves along at a fairly slow pace in seemingly odd moments, and the music choices only seem to exacerbate the plodding pace when this occurs, which is something I find especially troublesome considering the amazing Ken Burns is involved. I don't think it detracts terribly from the proceedings, but it's a notable issue given the pedigree.

Additionally, ***SPOILER!*** the man who ends up coming forward has a much more interesting story than what is portrayed here, and although it seems like more details emerged after the documentary was filmed, there are pieces that were certainly available at the time of this film's creation but they are missing in the narrative, and I felt like that was somehow telling, even though I didn't know that until after I watched it. In other words, the last ""act"" of the film feels like it comes out of nowhere, somewhat contrived, and that's because it does pretty much show up without any real motive given.",1492300800,3,1296,4.967741935483871

Lived through the time of the arrests and trials of these teenagers. Definitely treated by prosecutors and some of the press in a racist matter.  Really conned these young men to implicate themselves and their friends in this brutal crime. And despite no physical evidence and the conflicting stories of the accused, a jury found them guilty of the brutal crime, when the real perpetrator was in their midst and continued to rape other women.  It disturbs me that despite the future confession and DNA evidence linking the real perpetrator of this crime, the police and DA did not admit to wrongdoing after the Central Park 5 all spent several years in prison for a crime they did not commit.  And now Donald Trump who at the time of the crime was calling for the death penalty for the Central Park 5 has refused to apologize for such after their innocence was revealed years later.",1477267200,4,994,4.689655172413793

Burns shows how politics, the media and public opinion  came together to carry out a gross miscarriage of justice; how the terms ""wilding"" and ""wolfpack"" were introduced by the media and consequently inflamed racial tensions in New York City during the late 80's and early 90's.

5533420,5,B00AZMFG48,"This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, painstaking in detail and richly evocative of a raw and painful time in the history of NYC. Most of all, though, it is an accurate and horrifying description of how justice and the presumption of innocence can be completely lost when we are collectively fired up in a frenzy of rage and scapegoating and racial stereotyping. In fact, I would say this is a must-see for any citizen who claims to believe strongly in the importance of a fair and impartial justice system.  We all need to understand how it is possible for even fair people to lose their usual skepticism and go along with anger instead of analysis; to latch onto a comfortable guilt narrative even when so many holes in that narrative are all too apparent.

 To see and to hear the voices of the young men who were victims of this frenzy should be an obligation of citizenship. Responsible citizens need to know how easy it is to make completely and horribly wrong judgments, especially at moments when a judgement seems to be so clear, such an easy call.  Listening to them, and hearing what we as a society collectively put them through, is excruciatingly difficult.

But even all these years later, their voices must be heard. We lost our way, and they paid the price.",1425945600,,1276,4.628318584070796

5533476,5,B00AZMFG48,"This beautifully made documentary tells a compelling tale of misjustice. What makes it so wrenching is that many of the people involved in railroading 5 innocent kids into a guilty verdict for a horrible crime are well known to me and generally highly respected. It is a morality tale about the power of obviously coerced confessions and how even the best intended DA and prosecutors could ignore blatant contradictory evidence when their self-interest is better served by failing to investigate further. It is yet another story of police lies and abuse amounting to criminal child abuse. I hope this film helps in legalizing a requirement that juveniles be filmed the entire time they are in police custody, not merely when they have broken down and are willing to say anything for a promise of release. It shows how a lone holdout juror was similarly broken down. All children need to be taught to say nothing without their parents and an attorney present. All kids should see this film to understand the dangers of bowing to police pressure. I am sure that almost all of the time the police pressure is used to extract confessions from the guilty, but safeguards are still needed to protect the innocent.",1410998400,,1207,4.864077669902913
5533477,1,B00AZMFG48,"This was a completely inaccurate, intentionally deceptive agenda driven production. For example no mention was made of the highly competent, articulate, credible black detective that made the arrest, has a command of the facts. No interview either, and he is no longer under a gag order and has a far better grasp on the facts of the case, since he was there. Viewers might question why it was cleverly concealed, the race of this detective, by the Burns clan.

No mention was made of the vast majority of forensic medical evidence Burns and his daughter had at their disposal but intentionally, deliberately overlooked, because that blood and semen, found on the actual female attempted murder victim's clothing did NOT match Matias Reyes, therefore squashing their sole attacker narrative. There was also blood, semen found on those innocent boy's clothing, also not mentioned. DNA was also in its infancy at the time or the unbiased forensic evidence to convict the five admitted rapists, along with Reyes, would have been more complete. They were not even the only attackers, just the ones charged in the gang rape, attempted murder.

Also if Burns wanted to make a documentary highlighting race relations, racism, why not interview Al Sharpton, who blamed the victim, calling her a whore, claiming her white boyfriend was the rapist? I guess that does not fit the narrative of the tale Burns is spinning here. Has anyone with actual investigative experience from a police agency ever been given access to Matias Reyes to find out his real version of events with cross examination of glaring inaccuracies? The story that would rationally deduce multiple attackers? Of course not, because Reyes did not cause all the damage to the victim, nor could he simultaneously scratch, gouge her inner thighs, hold her arms down, with two arms. Reyes is guilty, but he shares that guilt with 5 millionaire violent sexual predators walking the streets.

The Central Park Five is indeed a travesty of justice, an assault on the criminal justice system, the character of the much maligned hard working cops, including the black cop that made some of the initial arrests, and further victimization of the real victims that night, the woman left for dead, and other victims robbed, beaten. Now we can add NYC taxpayers robbed to the tune of $40 million by a conspiracy of immoral racial arsonists,self important incompetents like Morganthau looking to secure his legacy, and white apologist Marxists like Bill deBlasio, concerned more with an agenda, appeasement to secure votes, than the truth.

5533550,5,B00AZMFG48,"A group of five African American teen-agers were railroaded in New York in 1989 to admit to a horrible assault on the Central Park Jogger. Young, black, without representation even by their parents, these five were vilified in the press for something called ""wilding,"" a name given to the horrible assault. The DAs and the detectives had to have known the evidence was false, but there was so much pressure to convict someone, anyone, that these young men were convicted and served their full sentences before it was proven that they had not committed the crime. It was the honesty of a prisoner who met one of the convicted men in prison, realized he was serving a sentence for the crime this prisoner had committed, and admitted to the crime to get the other person released.

The film was produced by Ken Burns, his daughter Sarah, and her husband David McMahon, and bears the hallmarks of a Burns production: excellent research, primary sources, media clips, interviews with the now exonerated men who have yet to put their lives back together, and excerpts of the forced confessions. The film is wonderful and leaves you wondering about justice in this country, and the book expands on sections that couldn't be included in the film.

I used the film in a course on media and conflict to examine how race is presented in the media and how media coverage can contribute to racial conflict. I lived in New York at the time, and everything that is shown in the film is what I remember. A bit more attention to how the minority press covered the story would have been helpful, but that topic became part of the assignments.

You need not be teaching a course to see just how good this film is and how important it is for everyone to see. The wrongly-convicted men sued the state for compensation to which they are entitled.

The five young men accused in the case were eventually exonerated by DNA evidence after many years, but Burns briefly explains enough about that to illustrate how tragic the whole situation is, how it was a matter of chance that the guilty person was able to convince police that these innocent men were innocent.  Last I checked, the city had spent millions defending itself from the civil rights suit brought against them.

This film makes you appreciate why someone in their situation would file a lawsuit, gather the information and put their story together.  We do need to recognize what happened, so that such errors are not repeated.

5533631,3,B00AZMFG48,"Spoiler alert ***

The ""CP5"" were not all innocent of crime that night and I noted how the film skillful skirted that issue. These ""charming young boys"" were, in reality,  kids who were acting on the group mentality and ""wilding"" (as the media loved to repeat).

The crime was solved with DNA, but honestly, just because there was no DNA does not mean the boys were not there or did not take part in something: holding down, dragging, kicking, etc. I do not know enough about this case to go into long detail about why they are or are not 100% innocent. But police DID have probable cause to question.

America is a racist country, folks; let's be honest. It was founded on discrimination: tribe vs tribe, white vs red, everyone vs Mexicans, black vs white. Too many people tend to look first at color then at religion. The film seems angered that the city suspected these 5 black kids, but in reality a black kid DID the rape (per DNA). But one young white female really spoke the truth on film when she says it should not be about race, but about such a heinous crime against someone who should have felt safe. That was reduced to a soundbite.

Was it a bad thing these kids were accused and found guilty despite lack of evidence, DNA, and based solely on the words of the police and witness testimony? It happens in more cases than I care to count.",1391990400,,1351,4.409638554216867

5533634,5,B00AZMFG48,"Living in NYC, there hasn't been a year that has gone by that I have not talked about this case. NYC in the 80s and 90s was a different place for me. Yes, a lot has changed. Yet, there are many things that remain the same such as how the justice system continues to railroad the Black and Latino male population.

This is certainly one film that should be watched by all teens and their parents. It shows how something so minor like being in the park can change your life forever. It is also a film that should be watched by individuals wishing to join the criminal justice system. The public requires criminal justice servants to have the courage to stand up for families and their kids who find themselves in a similar situation. When it doesn't make sense, that should be your call to LEAD. You have the lives of individuals in your hands, it is not a responsibility to be taken lightly. Don't follow behind the bureaucrats who don't care because these kids and their families are not theirs. They only want to make a ""name"" for themselves such as what happened here. It should be watched by anyone who can serve on a jury. The jury was their last hope but because of negative pressure and lack of common sense, they sealed the nail on the lives of these kids and their families.

There are many times when I cried watching this film. I have a 14 year old son who looks very similar to one of the young teens. The heartache these children and their families suffered was painful to see again. I always wondered how do you explain to your young son that your best just didn't work - it wasn't enough. As a parent, there is no peace while your young son is locked away at Spofford (aka Rikers Training Camp) or Rikers with the label of ""rapist"" over his head. The prosecution, journalists, cops, etc celebrated Christmas and went on vacation. As you can see, time stood still for these families.

I still remember when they were cleared but the world was too busy focused on what happened the year before to The Towers to really care about these five men. It was a slap in the face for many reasons because their innocence needs to be proclaimed every year. The real criminals are the evil prosecutors, attorneys and cops who made careers out of their unforgivable and racist rampage against these young kids and their families. It is ridiculous that after all this time their lawsuit has yet to be resolved. Trisha Meili was a victim who received compensation and is now a paid spokesperson. These men were victimized too. They deserve every dollar from everyone who ensured they would never see the light of day again. I have yet to hear of anyone involved in this witch hunt apologize to them publicly for their heinous actions. Matias Reyes is an awful a person to have done this and not speak up back then. Yet, even he still managed to have some kind of sense to apologize. Some of them were stupid enough to say they stand behind their actions. We all know had it been your family, the story would have played out much differently.

Again, a lot has changed but a lot has remained the same in NYC. This film shows exactly how NYC's (I'm sure other cities too) ""justice"" system continues to operate for young Black and Latino men. It's no longer front page news. Please help change it so it stops destroying innocent people and their families.",1391904000,,3350,4.4868852459016395

It is a careful examination of the events, the players, and the refusal of some of those players to acknowledge the errors made, which in turn makes it difficult to have any faith that such a miscarriage of justice will not be repeated.",1391472000,,518,4.5
5533648,5,B00AZMFG48,"Brilliant documentary laying out a set of social injustices in 1989 New York City.  I remember being roughly the same age as these 5 teenagers and in high school in Brooklyn when it happened.  I recall my history teacher pulling out the newspaper and showing us the front page with the headshots of these kids and the term ""wilding"" appearing in large bold letters.  I also remembered sitting next to a black classmate and both of us discussing how the kids were all black and Hispanic.  This in a predominately black and Hispanic high school and I remember the awkwardly tense environment this popular case created in my school among the student body.  The film even dealt with that in a very straight forward manner that I very much appreciated.  Thats an easy thing for people to want to shy away from and it takes some courage to admit it and bring it to light.

Another thing this film portrays is how the police and district attorneys regarded these kids as guilty from the beginning before it even reached the newspapers.  Then they became guilty in the eyes of the media, which then landed the final blow by creating the same guilty conclusion in the minds of much of the public.  ""The Crime of the Century"" it was called.  And in the end of it all, it turns out they were actually innocent.  So I guess it was the crime of the century---just not one perpetrated by these kids, but instead the one perpetrated by the system.

The original case received so much media attention in 1989 that I think it was impossible to not hear something about it and this was the days before the internet and easy 24-hour access to news.  Meanwhile, when a black woman was raped and thrown off of a roof in Brooklyn on the same day, it got very little attention.  The racial implications in this Central Park jogger case were very disturbing and well elucidated in the film.

Taking 5 14-16 year old kids and coercing them into giving false statements of guilt just to close a case under pressure.  It sadly also resulted in the actual guilty person to roam free and commit more rapes while these innocent kids were being convicted.

This is an incredibly sad tale and I had been wanting to see this film since it first came out in theaters.  It brought back a lot of memories.  It is tragic indeed and not something that should be forgotten, but unfortunately their exoneration got very little attention so most people from the time Im sure have no idea of how this all turned out.  I didn't even know until I heard of this film, which was 23 years later.

The film is an important film for that reason.  It is the greatest public statement of the injustice that was carried out in a number of different ways by different criminal justice departments of our system.  Legendary documentarian Ken Burns and his daughter Sara, as well as her husband, did an excellent job of bringing the social/political implications and ramifications to light with both heart and a commitment to factual rigor.

This film really should be watch by many more people, especially those of us from this time period.  I conveniently saw it on netflix.",1391385600,3,3121,4.5801801801801805

5533650,5,B00AZMFG48,"I clearly remember this incident. At the time I felt the same shame and disgust the rest of the country felt. But, to know that these poor kid's lives were ruined by lies and that they were ""railroaded"" in the truest sense of the word gives new meaning to the emotions. The facts presented by this documentary should make everyone angry. And, should force each and every one of us to question any case that is ""quickly solved.""

And, there's one more thing that should anger us.

Once it became clear that the wrong people had been convicted many seemed not to care. And, apparently, to this day, some NY police and prosecutors are totally reluctant to admit their mistake. That is as wrong as the original crime.

Watch this - and remember it - so that the next ""quickly solved"" horrific crime is viewed with the appropriate skepticism it deserves.

And when it came out that they were indeed innocent and the police refused to admit they got it wrong and the DA refused to admit they got it wrong I wonder, 'How far have we really come?'

Any New Yorker knows and will tell you, that it is just asking for trouble to do what she did. The prosecutors who made sure the lives of these 5 young men would be ruined forever, and the court that permitted and propagated this injustice and of course the conviction-hungry cops should be rewarded for their crimes by serving the same 13 years in prison that these young men received.

My heart breaks for these boys and the men they had to become too soon. Fortunately, they seem to be handling it better than I think many would have. Once again, the corruption in NY is aiding the delay in the suing of the police and prosecutors involved who deserve their just desserts for the crimes THEY committed.

I was really surprise about this case because I remember hearing about it but never found out the outcome.  I remember feeling very sorry for the woman attacked and wanting the attackers to serve the maximum time.  As a woman living alone, I felt outrage about the incident.
I never suspected all the behind-the-scenes dealings of the district attorney and the police against the youths.  I feel outrage now that they had to spend so much time in jail for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  What I wonder is why none of the parents opted to speak with an attorney when asked if they wanted one.  I know that I would never have allowed a child of mine to admit to being guilty if I believed they were innocent.  It was a huge miscarriage of justice that will probably never be put right.
They should not have suffered for so long for being nave and immature.  Those years are gone and they will never get them back.  Their lives was permanently change and the repercussion will live with them for the rest of their days.

5533801,2,B00AZMFG48,"The kids apprehended for the Central Park Jogger Rape and their families are interviewed about getting railroaded into ""confessing"" to the crime. I am convinced that this happens after seeing a lot of police interrogation videotapes on true crime TV shows. I thought suspects could just say they want an attorney present before answering any more questions, but I can see how a naive kid would be intimidated. That said, the interviews got rather repetitive and the view point extremely one-sided. It left me wondering just what were these kids doing out there at night given the lawlessness and mob violence that was a regular occurrence in Central Park during the 1980's. It would seem given the very young ages of some of these boys that their parents must have been missing-in-action for this to have been acceptable. I believe these kids were very likely up to no good out there but I also feel there was an inadequate investigation and rush to judgment. It was insane for the Central Park Jogger to venture out there at night too, but she definitely suffered the consequences for her decision.

Anyway, the interviews just kept repeatedly rehashing things so much that about halfway through the movie I decided that there must be no more information to impart on the subject and I quit watching it.",1382400000,4,1304,4.8475336322869955

Some 20+ years later I was astonished at how this whole thing played out.  The filmed statements from the 5 men were especially telling to me.

5533968,1,B00AZMFG48,"The Central Park Five is an interesting documentary with an entirely biased viewpoint that spoils the entire film. While the case is interesting and the fact surrounding the case are certainly documentary-worthy, the film's central narrative is that five black kids in New York, amidst an out-of-control crime problem that plagued New York City, were railroaded by an evil, white society hell-bent to make this crime fit the suspects.

I am a HUGE fan of Ken Burns, even though he can get a bit preachy. While I will not argue that the film highlighted some issues worth discussing, I am far from convinced of its central premise. Some thoughts:

1) Too much focus is placed on the methods by which the detectives obtained confessions. Yes, it is entirely likely that these detectives, who had sworn to protect a community that was fed up with violent crime, were under a lot of pressure to catch the culprit(s) of this crime. As a result, yes, they likely pushed these kids to confess and pushed them hard.

However, they confessed. I can understand re-examining these confessions, but the fact remains that it was the fault of these kids who confessed- not the fault of the detectives who obtained the confessions with having read them their Miranda rights, videotaping them and in the presence of their parents. I'm sorry if they thought that by admitting a crime of rape that they would be going home that afternoon, but that's not how it works.

2) The film also criticizes society for willing to believe in the guilt of these kids. Americans were aghast at this crime and the newspapers reported that the kids had confessed. Of course, the legal system must still runs its course, but America's willingness to believe these kids did it was a result of everybody (including the kids) agreeing that they had done it.

3) The underlying racial tone of this film is that Americans were all-too-ready to believe and jump-to the bestial stereotypes of black youths. But, what the film conspicuously neglects to outline is that the rapist who had raped and beat the jogger WAS a young, black man. Perhaps New Yorkers' reaction to the grisly attack was appropriate, but just aimed at the wrong kids.

4) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: These kids were not saints. We should remember that their excuse for why it was impossible for them to be raping and beating a woman was that at the time of the attack, they were in a different part of the park, participating in a ""Wilding"" crowd that was beating other innocent people.

The film unfairly portrays the reaction by the people and the police to this crime and unfairly characterizes the Central Park Five by omitting a discussion of their culpability in aiding in their own prosecution and their low respect for civic-mindedness.

Overall, the film is an interesting documentary ruined by the placement of an obvious agenda. Burns could have done much better by providing a more balanced discussion.",1370563200,40,2938,4.838645418326693

5534001,5,B00AZMFG48,"I can remember the story of the Central Park Five very well due to the almost constant news coverage even though I lived thousands of miles away from New York.  The stories about ""wilding"" where gangs of inner city youth were running amok and terrorizing citizens was like something out of a horror movie.  At the time, I was probably about the same age as some of those young men who were convicted.  I saw their pictures on television and condemned them due to the stories that were being reported by supposedly reputable news agencies.  Watching this movie made me realize how easily I accepted the idea of their guilt due to my own prejudicial ideas.  They were young, black or Hispanic men from a rough section of New York who were confessing to commiting the crime.  If the group had been white guys from Manhattan, would everyone have been so quick to condemn them?  Of course not.  The horror that all of the young men have been through is inexcusable.  There was too much conflicting testimony during their trials.  It should have at least raised questions in the prosecutors minds but they needed a culprit or culprits to convict and it was easier to ignore what didn't fit than to try and explain it.  While the convictions were overturned, nothing can ever repay the five for the years they lost.  All seem to have moved on as much as was possible but their pain is still so obvious as you hear them tell their stories.  This film is moving and I hope in some small way helps the Five to regain part of the faith in humanity that was taken from them.  If you're 40 or over, you need to watch this to understand how our justice system went so wrong.  If you're younger, you need to watch this film to see the injustice of our history so that we don't repeat it.  In other words, everyone over the age of 15 or 16 should see this film. I understand that the five are now suing the City of New York for their mishandling of this case.

5534026,5,B00AZMFG48,"In the early evening hours of April 19, 1988, a 28 year old investment banker named Trisha Meili was jogging in Central Park when she was attacked and brutally raped. Several suspects were brought in for questioning who described their activities that night as ""wilding,"" slang for making mischief in the form of assault, robbery and general hooliganism in the park. With the young woman in a coma and not expected to live, the five Hispanic and black youths were quickly rounded up by a Police Department that was under pressure to find the hoodlums and bring the case to justice.

Adding fuel to the fire was Donald Trump, never missing a moment for self-promotion, put out full page ads in the major New York newspapers calling for a reinstituted death penalty. Former Mayor Ed Koch helped contaminate the jury pool by saying in front of the camera ""we have to call them suspects"" implying that it was a nicety applied to the guilty. Even the mainstream media jumped on the bandwagon publishing the names and the addresses of the suspects, even those that were under-age. Minority newspapers retaliated outraging white New Yorkers by publishing the name of the victim.  The pictures of the guilt- and shame-ridden faces revealed their guilt to everyone white. It was a D.W. Griffiths nightmare-- the evil black men were raping ""our white women,"" just as portrayed in the movie that glorified the Ku Klux Klan a hundred years earlier.

Interrogated hour after hour, each suspect was worn down from the coaxing and cajoling, finally admitting to the crime or implicating someone with them in the belief that they could go home if they just confessed. The parents, as ignorant of the judicial process as their offspring, encouraged them to confess. To their surprise indictments followed, but that was only part of the nightmare. One parent hired a divorce and real estate lawyer to defend her son. One of the defendant's lawyers slept threw some of the testimony.  And while judges in criminal cases are generally chosen by the name falling out of a tumbler, a judge was assigned to the case, a judge who had the reputation for siding with prosecutors. Couple all these phenomena with the power of confessions, the fate of the defendants was sealed even though the D.A. had no physical evidence that put any of them at the scene of the crime.

Fate, career and relationships often turn on coincidences, and sometimes justice does too. It is clear that the five would have served out their entire sentences because they were unwilling to admit to any parole board that they committed the crime. But one of the five saw Matias Reyes, another inmate in prison. Reyes sensing trouble from their previous meetings on Rikers Island was surprised when he held out his hand to Reyes in friendship.

Now for the confession that really mattered. Touched by the offer of friendship, Reyes confessed to the crime, and gave New York City detectives details that weren't released to the public. The real coup d' grace was that his D.N.A was a perfect match to that found on the victim. A timeline search by reporters discovered that the Central Park Five could not have been in the same place as the jogger who followed a routine workout and route schedule.

The five were set free and tell their story here. Ken Burns once again demonstrates his talent for documentaries that is sobering, shameful, enlightening.  You feel the deep sense of loss that each felt at the injustice that robbed them of years of their lives. As one said, by this time in his life, he should have been married, had kids, and living in his own home. He wonders where to go to get his life back. And while any one of us will deny that our search for justice was racist, one woman who was interviewed asked: ""Would anyone have noticed if it was a black woman who was raped in Harlem?""

This is powerful and disturbing.

Update:

Several personalities come in for a roasting which includes conservative pundit, author and lawyer, Ann Coulter who claimed in her book, ""Demonic,"" that liberals are only interested in the rule of law when it comes to protecting criminals. Coulter, of course, uses the Central Park Five as her example. Coulter wailed and gnashed the following in a column: ""Consider only the odds of a false confession leading to a conviction. If the judge believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If the jury believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If an appeals court finds the confession was not voluntary, it will be thrown out. If the police fail to read the suspect his Miranda rights, the confession will be thrown out. If the defendant lyingly [sic] claims he was not read his Miranda rights and gets some appeals court to believe him, the confession will be thrown out. If the police question a juvenile outside the presence of his parents, the confession will be thrown out.""

Not so fast, Goldilocks!

1) There are plenty of examples of people making false confessions and being convicted.

2) Confessions are a powerful influence with juries. In many cases juries will ignore or dismiss evidence that contradicts the confession. This jury did with the exception of one who held out until he was browbeaten into changing his verdict.

3) Coulter ignores that Reyes' DNA was a perfect match with semen found on the jogger.

4) As one blogger wrote the Police videotaped the confessions, not the questions.

5) The Police treated this almost as a murder, having homicide detectives investigate the case instead of sex crimes detectives.

6) The Police discovered the DNA several years before and did nothing about it.

Donald Trump tweeted ""What were the Central Park Five doing in the park?"" There are two possibilities: a) they had no business being in the park because they're black and Hispanic, which makes perfect sense if one thinks like a racist, or b) it was none of Trump's  business. He deleted his tweet shortly after. It looks like the Donald wanted to be thought of as a ""b"" rather than as a first class ""A.""

Matias Reyes went on to rape more women and even killed one in the time of the arrest of the Central Park Five and their incarceration.

Mayor Bloomberg refuses to settle a lawsuit brought by the Central Park Five. Could it be if the city did, they would or could be sued by the families of Matias' other rape victims?",1368057600,15,6429,4.736794986571173

5534034,4,B00AZMFG48,"Living near New York City my whole life, I was around when the subject of the 2012 documentary THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE was referred to by all as ""the Central Park jogger case.""  But the white woman jogger who was assaulted in Central Park that evening of April 19, 1989, proves not to be the only person victimized.  Five non-white teen males as young as 14 go to jail for the crime even though they didn't do it and would have beaten the rap had responsible people based decisions on fact instead of conjecture and, much worse, not exploited these youngsters for political purposes.

THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE emphasizes original interviews with the wrongly accused Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise telling their side of the story.  Others such as journalist Jim Dwyer and the late mayor Ed Koch appear, too, but the five men who as teen-age boys were railroaded by the police and the criminal justice system are up front and center.  God knows enough people who didn't know what they were talking about got too much attention in 1989.  Even the involvement of famed people's attorney William Kunstler goes unmentioned in this film, though I imagine were he still alive, he would have been interviewed.",1367539200,,1243,4.812206572769953
5534035,5,B00AZMFG48,"This film shows how the gears of fate bear teeth of truth, and compromise, of ambition and bad luck, how events mesh with emotions  to railroad justice.  New Yorkers like myself, especially, remember the lurid headlines in those days of exploding crack vials - a female jogger assaulted by 'wilding' kids.  The tenor of the times is evoked with clips from Ed Koch, and Berhard Goetz, the 'subway vigilante', among others.

Each of the kids emerges as a unique personality, both at the time, and after their exoneration, through the use of well-chosen video.  Reyes, the actual perpetrator, who was never charged, or even investigated, though there was reason to do so, remains a shadowy presence, and, in the end, an unlikely savior.  There is no sugar-coating here:  Jim Dwyer, the excellent NY Times reporter, speaking of the timeline journalists so crave, says,  ""given the jogger's usual pace through the park, and her starting time, she couldn't have been assaulted by these kids at the time and place the cops asserted, because the kids, at that time, were elsewhere in the park, harassing others.""

One is reminded of the fiction work, Mystic River, in which terrible events change the course of lives, even as they are subsumed by the tides of time.  Burns here burnishes an already superlative resume, with a salvage of things forgotten, of lives underwater for years, of truth that was forced to hold its breath so long.

If you are moved by the ironies of politics, and the tragedies that are lived in their aftermath, this film will be enjoyable, in the astringent way that addressing a wound begins the healing.",1367366400,,1624,4.869090909090909
5534036,3,B00AZMFG48,"There is clearly no question that a grave injustice took place in this case, and the film is (like all of Ken Burns' works) compelling watching.  But the producers overplayed their hand here, and the result is a movie that on a close analysis -- just from its own content, without doing any external research about the case -- overstates the case to the point of misrepresenting what exactly happened.

There is a general principle in journalism that you make the strongest argument you can, and if somebody says something, the viewer/reader can infer that nothing stronger could have been said.  An easy example is, ""The Yankees have lost 13 of their last 15 games.""  When you read that, you know two things:  they lost 13 of their last 15 games, and 16 games ago, they won.  Otherwise, the story would have been that they lost 14 of their last 16 games.

This principle compels certain inferences that seriously undermine the overall message of the movie.  In fairness, sort of, the producers often include the information that shows ""the rest of the story"", but generally it goes so fast that if you blink, you miss it.

First of all, there was no ""Central Park Five"".  Initially it was something like the Central Park 30.  Then when it came to seeking indictments it was something like the Central Park 12.  Then when it came to actually going to trial, it was the Central Park Eight.  Three were allowed to plead guilty to offences other than the attack on the jogger.  This all comes at the endnotes to the movie, which all tend to contradict the entire premise of the movie:  they picked these five innocent kids, and went all-out to convict them, regardless of the truth.  Well, no.  The fact that some were not indicted, and some were NOT taken to the end shows that the prosecutors were making principled decisions regarding the conduct of their case.

Second, early in the film, they show one of the Five's supporters, Rev. Calvin Butts, saying, ""The first thing you do in the United States of America when a white woman is raped is round up a bunch of black youths, and I think that's what happened here.""  That's a great quote, but Burns knows that that is not what happened.  Two of the five were arrested, with others, in Central Park that night.  They, and others, told police who else was there, and police subsequently arrested those people who were named -- Yusef Salaam says so himself.  The arrests weren't some sort of arbitrary rounding up of anyone who was young and black.  As one of the commentators says at one point in the film (again, blink and you'll miss it), the police had probable cause to arrest the kids.  The problems that led to the miscarriage of justice happened after that.

Third, in the description of the trial, Burns says that one of the five lawyers ""didn't even challenge the admissibility of his client's statement.""  Well, hold on there, partner.  ONE of the five?  So that means four of the five did challenge it, which means there was a judicial hearing (called a voir dire) where a judge (without a jury) hears evidence about the taking of the statement, and makes a ruling on its admissibility.  The prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was not coerced, and on a balance of probabilities that their civil rights weren't violated.  Obviously, the hearing was held, and the statements were ruled admissible.  Again, in a ""blink and you'll miss it"", there was a brief, passing mention of that fact when the prosecutors are quoted saying, among other things, that the confessions withstood the attack at two separate trials.  But why was there not a lengthier (and more unambiguous) mention of that -- the evidence led during the voir dire, and the conclusions of the judge?  Because it doesn't help advance their argument.

Fourth, and most damning, Burns quotes each of the Five talking at length about how they never admitted to participating in the attack on the jogger.  According to them, they were just witnesses who pointed the finger at the other boys.  Well, there are two problems here.  The first is that throughout the film, they show print and t.v. reports which refer to the boys' ""confessions"".  The film never challenges that.  At no point did somebody other than the Five say, ""I listened to those so-called confessions, they never admitted doing anything.""  Even the juror who was interviewed never said that.  Why didn't they have somebody other than the Five say they never confessed?  Because they couldn't.  The boys' recollections of what they told the police are, understandably, inaccurate.

There's another point regarding their statements, which wouldn't be obvious to a non-lawyer.  A person's statement is only admissible in evidence against himself, not against other co-defendants.  If it was indeed the case that each of the five did no more than point the finger at the others, while maintaining their own innocence, there would have been no admissible evidence against any of the five, and the jogger-related charges would have been dropped against them, as they were against the other three defendants (who did not admit to participating in that attack).

Pure and simple, by showing the Five telling us ""I never admitted anything"", without something more reliable giving the contrary view, I was left with the feeling that Burns lied to us.

The movie overall has too much of this kind of content, which comes across as biased.  They repeatedly have people giving commentary and opinions that fall outside their field of expertise:  journalists and historians talking about issues that should have been discussed by lawyers and psychologists, for example.  Also, they really cherry-pick the media reports from the day.  One example is what we are supposed to see as a damning interview with Elizabeth Federer, where she's asked if she was concerned about the lack of DNA evidence.  She says she can't answer the question because there's another trial pending.  Well, why put that in the movie?  Of course she couldn't answer the question!  I find it hard to believe that she was never asked about that subsequently, after the second trial was over.  But she might have had an answer that, again, didn't further the agenda of the film.

I don't get why Burns thought that the actual story wasn't strong enough to be worthy of a documentary.  It is a notorious fact in the criminal justice system that, until fairly recently, the methods of police investigation and interrogation were seriously flawed, and resulted in many false confessions and wrongful convictions.  Similarly, there were (and still are) pockets in every prosecutors' offices where the primary goal is to get convictions, not to achieve a just result.  The fact that five young men could spend so much time in jail, without anyone doing anything that was clearly wrong (by the standards of the time), for me is a lot more scary than the story presented, of isolated police misconduct.

The film itself is extremely well put-together from a movie making perspective.  It is very compelling to watch.  Just know that it's more like Oliver Stone's JFK than a real documentary.  As a result, Ken Burns, for me, has really tarnished his brand with this one.",1367193600,47,7238,4.83726606997559
5534037,4,B00AZMFG48,"the importance of the subject matter and the fact that Ken Burns got the truth out there gives it the fourth star, but it wasn't done especially well.  The descriptive titles were ridiculously hard to read--tiny, white, on a busy background.  There wasn't enough depth and virtually nothing about the jogger.  I've seen much better, more thorough documentaries on the subject of false confessions.  If you want to see something that will blow your mind with the outrageously ridiculous false confessions and the absolute abuse of power by the interrogator, check out Frontline's The Confessions about the Norfolk Four.  That will give you a clearer idea of how someone can cave in to the pressure of interrogation.",1367107200,,714,5.068376068376068

Sadly, I was 19 when this event happened and I do not remember ever hearing of it before.  It was very informative, and the reason I feel it was objective is that it presented facts in a direct, nonoccusatory manner.  It wasn't about bashing the completely inexcusable manner this case was handled, but simply about putting out the information of how certain things were done that shouldn't have been and vice-versa.  I am glad for the Central Park Five that the truth came out, yet it is so distressing that it took so long and upsetting that the people and entities involved still have not truly acknowledged their inexcusable mangling of the case that took a childhood away from these men.
