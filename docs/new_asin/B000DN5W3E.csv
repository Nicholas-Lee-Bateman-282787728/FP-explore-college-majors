8102621,5,B000DN5W3E,We had a similar experience to Steph L! My nearing 3 year old has been dancing and acting out the stories with the DVD. She takes dance and it's great to show her some dancers in action. Great series!,1408233600,,200,4.153846153846154
8102622,5,B000DN5W3E,"We just so happened to check this DVD out from our public library. I had never heard of it. Our two little girls, ages 2 and 5, were enraptured while watching this. It's wonderfully creative and artistic. Also, it's educational yet they were so entertained! It's nice that it's broken down into shorter segments, but you can also watch the entire thing. I'm going to purchase our own copy. And I'll be checking out other videos of this same program.",1347840000,,449,4.625
