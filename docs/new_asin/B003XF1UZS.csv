4216407,4,B003XF1UZS,One of the classics. No true horror aficionado skips this one. Younger movie viewers might not appreciate its place in horror history though.,1376352000,2,141,5.173913043478261
4216408,4,B003XF1UZS,"Hey 1960's thriller fans, don't get yourself all wound up over the fact that this is not a high budget Hammer film and you'll do fine and enjoy the flick. Bava has a style all his own, and folks it's here in spades. Haunting music, erie lighting, minimalistic effects, all used to his advantage to deliver a very moody, atmospheric chiller that will set you on the edge of your seat. Make some popcorn on a Friday night and break out some ice cold bottles of soda and have good ol time watching this flick in a dark living room right around midnight.",1364083200,7,550,4.349514563106796
8408008,5,B003XF1UZS,"What a brilliant film by Mario Bava. A must own! They did a fantastic job with the set design on this one... the knights arms holding the candles in the hallway, freakin' killer. That's a 5 star movie for me.",1524873600,,208,4.225
8408009,3,B003XF1UZS,"This is a typical horror movie of the era... which means that it's well shot, has rich atmospherics, and carries a creepy vibe throughout.  However... it never delivers on the horror.  For the times that it was shot in, it was probably groundbreaking, and the title is provocative.  I ""liked it"" for the sets, old Italian ruins, and character creations.",1506038400,,353,4.85
8408010,5,B003XF1UZS,Beautiful horror film! Mario Bava at the top of his game as a visual artist.,1495497600,,76,4.133333333333334
8408011,5,B003XF1UZS,Great little flick!,1484697600,,19,5.666666666666667
8408012,5,B003XF1UZS,"Sooooooooo cheesy it's soooooooooo good!  And the cinematography is awesome!  LOVE this movie.  This probably wasn't meant to be a comedy, but I laughed all the way through it!",1483920000,,176,5.0
8408013,5,B003XF1UZS,Great price. Great product. Great shipping. What more could one want.,1470960000,,69,5.363636363636363
8408014,1,B003XF1UZS,"This rating (one star) is for the quality of the disc. It's been filmed from a TV screen. It's hard to tell, but the source may be a VHS tape. In any case, the result is very, very low resolution. Simply not worth it unless you're absolutely desperate to see this movie. I purchased a proper DVD version after receiving the Sinister Cinema disc, but it won't work for all audiences as the subtitles are French only. In case of interest, it's available on Amazon.fr with the French title ""Opration peur"". Arrow Films (UK) announced plans to release the film on blu-ray, but that was 2/more years ago. I'm not sure where they are with these plans.",1468800000,,645,4.521367521367521

8408017,4,B003XF1UZS,"What I expected from Mario Bava .the sets, the lighting. check out the color of the grass and of the stone walls in several shots for instance, my complaint is with the disc having no chapter selections ! Fall asleep 1/2 way through this one, and you will not be able to take up where you left off.",1384300800,3,298,4.155172413793103
