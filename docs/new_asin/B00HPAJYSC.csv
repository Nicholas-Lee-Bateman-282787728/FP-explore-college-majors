Liberace comes across as a gentleman with a musical background. Not only is his piano playing perfect, but he doesn't have a bad singing voice either. The episodes are based on a theme, San Francisco, Christmas, famous personalities... It's a happy and light show for everyone.",1390435200,3,403,4.771428571428571
8634077,1,B00HPAJYSC,"Don't get me wrong because I am one of the BIGGEST Liberace fans around. I have a fantastic Liberace gallery in my home.
I am always hoping that more unseen or rare footage of Liberace will be available for everyone to see.
This collection is just the same old shows that have been re-released over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and again. Just another company trying to make some money on the Liberace name.
When will some company come up with something that has not been seen hundreds and hundreds of times!!!!!!",1390435200,6,564,4.4326923076923075
