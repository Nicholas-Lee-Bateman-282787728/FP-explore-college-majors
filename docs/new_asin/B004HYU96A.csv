It shows lots of great things to do in Key West than I would have found on my own, and it was fun & enjoyable to watch. The host is pretty funny, and there are interesting guides who told me what I need to see and I also now know what to skip. It's so beautiful there! Now I'm even more excited for my trip.",1295308800,,408,3.8
8606140,4,B004HYU96A,"I've been to Key West a number of times.  It is a favorite place to relax and explore.  I watched Florida Key Adventures out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised to learn I only skimmed the surface of Key West's unique history, eclectic community and wild places.  If you want to make the most of your trip to Key West or in general appreciate the area, I recommend it.",1294358400,,374,4.391304347826087
