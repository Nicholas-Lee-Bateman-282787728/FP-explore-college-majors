I purchased Senior / Elderly Sitting Excercise DVD without light weights and was alternately using a walking exercise DVD that used weights. Then in September I was in an auto accident and broke my ankle. I couldn't do the walking exercises but I still needed to get some weight work. I showed this DVD to my Physical Therapists and they told me it would be very good for me. So I have been faithfully doing these exercises and it has helped me to get back on track with exercising almost daily. I am 65 years old and would recommend this DVD to anyone either Senior or someone who needs to excersise but cannot stand.",1224806400,5,948,6.059701492537314
2674788,5,B000JJS42I,"I am disabled and must walk with a cane or walker, so I am unable to do the usual types of exercises.  I can do this easily and feel refreshed  aftrewards.  I like it so well, I have purchased two more for friends.",1224547200,9,214,3.9302325581395348
2674789,5,B000JJS42I,"This is a great workout for the mobility impaired-- the exercises are done at a good pace, slow enough to follow, but fast enough to make you work.  All the exercises are performed sitting.  There are some leg exercises, but those unable to move their legs at all could skip those and replay the upper body exercises.

It's also a very flexible workout: the DVD is divided into a 20 minute exercise section, preceded by a five min warmup & a five min cool down.  This provides a nice, fast half-hour for those in a hurry.  But parts can easily be replayed for a longer workout; I usually do the 20 minute exercise section twice.  You can also rewind to do additional reps of particular exercises, use heavier or lighter dumbbells, or do some of the exercises while seated on a balance ball.  Sunshine uses dumbbells mainly for the upper-body exercises in the first half of the exercise section; for more exertion, I place my dumbbells longways along my thighs to do the leg exercises in the second half as well.

The sunny beach setting for the tape is great.  The music is also upbeat, generic and cheerful.  The music could possibly start to get old after several uses; but at that point you would be familiar enough with the routine that you could mute the sound and play your own music if you wanted.  All in all, a great way to help stay fit for people with mobility impairments, at a really great price.
Note: It also comes in a VHS format if you don't have a dvd player.",1198800000,50,1477,4.433333333333334
2674808,5,B000JJS42I,I'm not quite elderly yet but I just love this workout. I can feel the results after only one day; I plan on doing it every morning.,1381104000,,132,3.925925925925926
2674809,1,B000JJS42I,"As senior in a wheelchair, I have used other senior, sitting down exercise DVDs on a regular basis. I was hoping to add another useful DVD to my collection.

One time through this video was enough to tell me that I will NOT be using it again. In fact, it is going in the trash. Why?

1. The exercises using hand weight are done at a very rapid pace and could easily cause pain and even injury to anyone with osteoarthyritis or any other damage to the joints, such as the knees, shoulders or back. It is a good thing that there is a disclaimer at the start of the DVD, stating that the producers of this DVD are not responsible for harm done to anyone using this video. Someone is going to get hurt someday, if they try following the instructions and the pace of these exercises.

2. The 'model' for the exercises is a mute blonde with a perpetual grin throughout the whole program. She might as well be a cartoon drawing, as she is without personality and totally non-motivational. This woman named 'Sunshine' is no one that I can relate too as role model.

3. The only voice for this video is an unidentified female who keeps repeating the words 'Good' and 'Breathe' with every cycle of activity.

4. The continuous, background music is a fast paced, never changing, latin/jazz type of music that becomes irritating after the first 5 minutes. Only in the final section of the video are you freed from the constant trumpeting music.

5. Speaking of the 'final section' of the program, entitled Relaxation, there needs to be a warning for this part of the video as well. For the last 5 minutes, you are given an unsolicited introduction to meditation and religious idea of the 'Universal Light'. While Sunshine sits in a lotus position on some rocks by the sea, the video begins to give you indoctrination into the producer's religious concepts.

The moderator will give you the first steps to practicing mediation and adds some mantras from some New Age religion.

As a Christian, I found these unwelcome religious messages offensive. You are expected to repeat or at least internalize messages like: ""I have faith in me."", ""My health is my wealth."", ""Inhale positive energy."", ""Exhale negative energy."" and then...""Bring all the universal light into your heart.""

That was enough for me. My other exercise videos are much better produced, safer to use and don't throw in unwelcome religious indoctrination. This DVD will go in the trash.",1373414400,8,2438,4.704225352112676
2674810,5,B000JJS42I,I would recommend this to anyone wanting to develop strength.  It is slow and easy.  Can be done standing or sitting.,1372636800,,117,4.523809523809524

2674812,5,B000JJS42I,sunshine is great. Everything is done sitting in a chair (wheelchair) for example or can be done standing. A set of weights is needed. Half of the video is upper extremities using the weights and the other half is lower extremities which do not require the weights. However it is beneficial as a 30 minute video to do all extremities so it is great and the elderly love her. I work in a nursing home and they actually like to participate!,1345593600,,438,4.419753086419753
2674813,5,B000JJS42I,"This video is comprised of a 30 minute exercise workout using light weights.  It can be done sitting and or standing and is excellent for seniors or anyone who
has physical limits on many of the standard excercise routines.  You never have
to get down on the floor. The excercises are easy to follow, safe and fun.  Over
time they do increase your strength and mobility.",1329350400,,370,4.575757575757576
2674814,5,B000JJS42I,This video is very helpful for those individuals who cannot stand and do exercises.  Video arrived promptly - as described.,1319760000,3,123,5.15
2674815,2,B000JJS42I,"Some time ago I purchased ""Easy Chair Exercises, Easy Sitting Pilates & Calisthenics"" - with Sunshine. It's a strange presentation. Sunshine's almost like a robot. She never speaks, just does the exercises. The woman who does is clearly not a polished speaker, and she stumbles on a few occasions as she gives directions. The exercises themselves are good ones; I wish I didn't find watching Sunshine so unappealing.

However, I did somthing contradictory recently. When I searched Amazon for sitting exercises with weights, I found few. The one I chose (what WAS I thinking?!) was ""Sitting Light Weights, Sitting Dumbells & Pilates Exercises"" - with Sunshine. I'm in great need of upper body strengthening, and decided I could ignore the negatives in return for weight training.

What I received was what I ordered, but not what I expected. The DVD is like the one I already have; it's simply been edited in places to include weights. The major change is the use of weights in the FUNS section. The weigths just appear in Sunshine's hands - there are no cautions given, no suggestions about size of weights. After that weight section, the DVD seems just like the former. At various times throughout the presentation, Sunshine and the voice are not in sync.

My suggestion: think carefully before you purchase any DVD's in this series.",1315958400,12,1335,4.950892857142857
2674816,5,B000JJS42I,"I bought 2 DVDs  for my elderly aunt and she is very happy. The Doctor advised her to start exercising, a friend recommended this DVD, I am glad she did, its exactly what my aunty needed. The exercises are very easy to follow along and are doable by her. Sunshine very clearly explains and shows first how the exercise is to be done then she starts doing a set of 10 times of the exercise. Sunshine is always smiling and giving positive cues. Aunt loves the beach setting and likes the music I am glad to have got these DVDs for her. Recommended.",1313539200,3,546,4.300970873786408

This is a very gentle workout, and would be perfect for very elderly people.  The woman in the video sits on a chair at the beach, with lovely soft music playing.  I've found that this one is just a bit too light for my preference, however.",1312416000,3,374,4.082191780821918
2674828,3,B000JJS42I,I purchased this item for my mother who has had a stroke.  She did not like the model in the video saying that it looks like the head does not belong to the body.  The model has the same expression all the way through the workout--a silly grin that looks like it's painted on.  It's so monotonous and fake.  The exercises are o.k.,1310947200,2,330,4.190476190476191
2674829,2,B000JJS42I,"This program was designed for seniors/rehab, but the pace is very fast. The repetitions are much too fast for older folks or those who may be recovering from injury.

The exercises were very good for a chair workout. However, the program was narrated while Sunshine sat on her stool by the ocean with a frozen smile on her face the entire time she was following instruction. I thought this presentation was bizarre and awkward. It would have been better if she herself talked into the camera and engaged the audience. The narrator said ""You're doing great!"" after every exercise. It was supposed to be serious, but was quite funny. Sunshine never spoke, but waved goodbye at the end. It was really pretty comical. I would not use this series again.",1306108800,2,748,4.753846153846154
2674830,4,B000JJS42I,"Take one old lady, very stiff, much too heavy weight-wise, with breathing problems.
It's not pretty when I want to exercise. Loose, comfortable clothing a MUST.

First, I have to wake up! Giant cups of coffee anyone? Whoops... almost forgot to let the dogs out! Then, I have to pry my eyes open... and shuffle to the chair. Moaning and groaning, I reach down beside the chair for those dumb dumbbells ... I use the pretty pink 1 lb. ones... to avoid strain.
Next, I locate the cell phone, the kindle and the computer and check their charges and plug in when necessary. Of course that's all right beside my chair! I believe in efficiency!
 Finally... after a final petting of the dogs and a shifting around... lightly stretching my arms and toes and ankles... very lightly I might add... I look for the remote. Ah... there it is! I'm leaving this exercise DVD in the DVD player all the time.

Whoa.... slow down... I can't go that fast! Okay, okay... I'll do it. Whoops... are my arms jiggling again? Wiggle, wiggle. Groan and moan.

It's not pretty, but actually using the DVD on a fairly consistent basis is helping me with self-esteem issues too... after all, I am working to improve my body and health!  And it is honestly helping me.
I highly recommend this DVD... and I promise I'm not seen anywhere on it! <grin>

Since I had to have my left shoulder replaced 15 years ago due to a car accident, I have lost more than 50% of my range of motion in that shoulder. Today I was able to do many of the exercises for the upper body.  Since I was sitting in a chair, I did not have to worry about losing my balance and falling.

1) Warm-up calisthenics

2) About 8 minutes of actual lifting with dumbbells. The fact that this is a seniors and rehab video does not make it necessarily ""easy.""
