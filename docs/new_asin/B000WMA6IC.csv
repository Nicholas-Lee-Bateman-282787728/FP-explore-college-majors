2983583,5,B000WMA6IC,"Considering John Ford's reputation as one of the greatest and most influential American directors who won four Academy Awards for Best Director in the early sound era, it's about time some of his silent films were also released on DVD in a nice set which they deserve.  And this new set of five films lives up to expectations with beautifully restored clear picture quality and newly created orchestral music accompaniment to match the superior quality of each film.  Although well known to many as a director of Westerns with John Wayne, John Ford was also an actor, writer and producer, starting his career in films in the early 1910s, and by 1920 his skills had already been well developed, as the first film in this set, ""Just Pals"" clearly shows.  Equally skilled in any genre, Ford can bring out the best in a story with careful attention to drama and detail which express the emotions and depths of his characters.  This is perhaps most poignant in ""Four Sons"" which I found very moving, as well as impressive in its attention to the beautiful and detailed setting in Bavaria before and during World War I.  Just as much careful attention to detail was given by the modern music composers for these DVD releases, choosing tunes, instruments and moods which make the story and scenes become vividly real.  Cowboy tunes on guitar for some of the Westerns and German melodies for the setting in Bavaria are just two examples of this finely-tuned marriage of silent film and music presented on each of these discs.

No doubt one of his greatest Western epics, ""The Iron Horse"" is about the laying of the first railroad across the West to California, with emphasis on historic authenticity in every imaginable aspect, from featuring two of the original locomotives which were used in the real construction project, to the individual workers and their lives and personalities, at times seasoned with a touch of humour.  This grand production would rival a Cecil B DeMille epic in the number of people involved, as well as the moving and exciting historical event in itself, but there are similar such impressive grand-scale scenes in the other quite different Western in this set, namely ""3 Bad Men"", which focuses more on individual people and their personalities, and what really defines the word `bad'.  A similar examination of true characters in people is ""Just Pals"" about a lazy town bum and the homeless boy he takes under his wing as he tries to change his image and prove himself.  Quite different in setting but also very intriguing for some of its particularly wicked characters is ""Hangman's House"" which is actually set in Ireland, and along with a superbly eerie old house, it has a tight and complicated plot which unfolds at an exciting pace.  And for another change of pace, this time a human family drama oozing sentimentality and `old world charm', ""Four Sons"" is quite unforgettable, perhaps because it feels so real, and no doubt many families did indeed share a similar fate during WWI.  No matter which genre or type of story, Ford's expertise as a director and also producer make this excellent selection a worthy addition to any film-lover's collection, not just for silent film enthusiasts alone.",1198627200,14,3224,4.873857404021938
2983584,5,B000WMA6IC,"JOHN FORD'S SILENT EPICS which is part of the much larger FORD AT FOX collection is a most welcome addition to the catalogue of available DVDs and fortuntaely for silent film fans you don't have to buy the entire set. Of the 5 films in this set THE IRON HORSE is the most famous and has already been reviewed by me so I'll focus on the remaining four films. The title SILENT EPICS is a little misleading as two of the films JUST PALS from 1920 and HANGMAN'S HOUSE from 1928 are much smaller in scope dealing as they do with smalltown America and rural Ireland. FOUR SONS (1928) with its World War I setting and 3 BAD MEN (1926), another large scale Western, are certainly more deserving of the title.

All 5 films have newly commissioned musical scores by five different composers (Christopher Caliendo, Tim Curran, Dana Kaproff, and John & Alexander Kaplan) which their respective films perfectly. 4 of the 5 films begin with a gentle warning about bringing the film to DVD using the best available source materials which is another way of saying that they haven't been fully restored. Despite some scratches early on these movies look great considering their age and the fact that no original Fox silent negatives exist anymore. While the technology does exist to completely restore these films one can't expect Fox to spend a fortune on what is clearly a niche market and we are lucky to still have these titles at all.

3 BAD MEN presages Ford's 3 GODFATHERS (1948), HANGMAN'S HOUSE is the start of his love affair with Ireland (and John Wayne's first visible film appearance), and JUST PALS is an early vehicle for ill-fated Fox star Buck Jones who would die in Boston's notorious Coconut Grove fire in 1942. It was also Ford's first film for William Fox. The real treasure here in my opinion is FOUR SONS which combines Ford's epic and intimate qualities outside of the Western.

8223796,5,B000WMA6IC,"This collection from Fox includes:
Just Pals(released Oct/20), and stars cowboy star Buck Jones. This is a surprisingly pleasing film about Jones who is the town lag about or""bum""as some call him. He befriends a homeless boy and also has a hankerin' for the local school marm. The marm is taken advantage of by a local yokel who has embezzled local funds and wants her to hand over the fund SHE looks after in order to cover him. When the committee asks for the funds the marm holds and that she can't provide,she tries to kill herself. It's Jones to the rescue, but they accuse him of stealing the funds. When the smoke clears Jones is free,has $10,000 in his pocket(due to the finding of another stray boy whose father has paid handsomely),has his lady love and his best little pal. The chemistry between Jones and his orphan(Georgie Stone)is palpable and disarming. It's a simple story but an effective heart string tugger. 4-4 1/2 stars.
The Iron Horse(released Aug/24) stars,among others,George O'Brien and Madge Bellamy. This is an epic DW Griffith would have been proud to have made. It claims from the outset to be an historically accurate account of the building of the transcontinental railway in the U.S.The film starts out as a young O`Brien and his father depart their hometown for a surveying job in the western wilderness. The father is jumped and killed at their camp by a two fingered half breed, while his hidden son watches in horror. Years later O`Brien is now a pony express rider and is being chased by Indians when he is able to board a train to escape. There he meets his old girlfriend from his childhood who is now betrothed to a member of her fathers survey team.`The team has been unsuccessfully looking for a shorter route. O`Brien agrees to show his old girls fiance` where he and his father surveyed years before which would be ideal. However `two fingers`` now works for both the Indians, and into the confidences of the white folks, and wants the fiance to kill O`Brien to prevent the railroad from going through Indian land. The fiance almost,but not quite,does it. Soon after, O`Brien returns and gets the railroad back on track to the pass he discovered. He eventually kills the fiance(in a bar room brawl), and `two fingers`during an Indian ambush. His old girl rebuffs him and he transfers to the railway company coming in from the opposite direction. In the end the two railways meet, as do the young lovers who make up and live happily ever after. The film tries to be authentic as much as it can. At the driving of the last spike ceremony, the very same engines used in 1869 were used for the film. Lincoln is portrayed ,as is Wild Bill Hickok. The rest is pure Hollywood, but it is enjoyable to the nth degree. The interplay between three or four work hands in particular always brings a smile to the face and a break in the seriousness of the proceedings. Here we have both the U.S.version(150 minutes) and the International version(133 minutes).4 1/2-5 stars.
Three Bad Men(released Aug/26)stars,among others,George O'Brien and Olive Borden. Borden and her father are headed west to get in on the new land rush about to start in the Dakotas of the late 1800s. Along the way Borden and OBrien meet and flirt some. They part and soon Borden and her dad are ambushed and her father gets killed. The murderers themselves are set upon by three ne-er do wells who take Borden into their crooked bosoms and look after her by taking her with them to her destination in the Dakotas. There she again reunites with OBrien and the crooks take it upon themselves to pronounce OBrien as Bordens new groom. Through much hardship in the temporary town they stay at(a corrupt sheriff in particular who kills one of the crooks sisters), the couple are finally brought together and live happily ever after. A nice story of three crooks who try and create some meaning in their lives by helping out first a young girl,then later get her safely married to a man of their choosing. A solid cast. 4 stars.
Hangmans House(released May/28)stars,among others,Victor McLaglen,June Collyer,and Larry Kent. McLaglen is a soldier stationed in North Africa and receives a telegram begging his return to Ireland. He must return in secret as he is a wanted man there. He meets up with is old friend Kent. Kents love is being married off by her father(a hanging judge and hence the title) to a drunken socialite who wants nothing but her money. Hogan has his issues also with the socialite. In the films climax McLaglen and Kent confront him,who ends up falling to his death as the titled house goes up in flames. Not up to the caliber of the other films here,I give it a 2 1/2- 3 star rating.
Finally there is Four Sons(released Feb/28) which stars,among others, Margaret Mann,James Hall and Charles Morton. The story is set in pre war Germany where a dear mother and her four sons live. When war comes one son has emigrated to the States while two others go off and are killed. The third one is eventually conscripted and is also killed. When the war is over the last son sends for his mother,who comes to live with him. This film was a gamble to make as anti-German sentiment was still high among a lot of Americans. But the film works on many levels and its themes are universal. When her only son in the States also goes to war for the U.S.,a pal says to him during a bad moment over there-I guess Heinies got families too. There are so many strong characters in the small German village,such as the postman whose heart breaks worse with each telegram he has to deliver to the poor mother. In fact every character rings true and it is why this film succeeds so well. 4 1/2 -5 stars.
The films over all are in great condition considering their ages,and the soundtracks are quite well done in enhancing the viewing experience. Three Badmen and Hangmans House are a double sided disc. The Iron Horse has two discs,one for the American,and one for the International version. There is also a facsimile program from its debut at Graumans. The other two are single discs. Ford I found did better at more serious subjects than he did at comedy(see my review on his comedy collection at Fox).That ,along with populating all his films with strong and identifiable characters,were his two strong suits. All in all this is a must have collection by director Ford.",1484611200,,6366,4.664590747330961

8223798,4,B000WMA6IC,"I mainly picked this up for 'Four Sons', as I already had a copy of 'The Iron Horse'. Little did I realise that the best film in the box set is '3 Bad Men', which is a near masterpiece that certainly ranks alongside Ford's later work such as 'Stagecoach', 'Fort Apache' and 'The Searchers'. A film that is part satire and part drama, but doesn't go over the top and the story is grounded and balanced, with superb performances by the entire cast. It is probably the best silent Western I have ever seen and now ranks amongst my favourites of the genre.

As for 'Four Sons' I was really expecting it to have the movietone soundtrack and was perplexed as to why it wasn't included. The movietone soundtrack was one of the more intelligent and powerful uses of sound during the late silent era. That said the picture quality (as with the other films in the set) is of a very good standard and has been well restored. The film itself is a solid, if somewhat unrealistic account of a family's experience during The Great War. At times it is a bit too steeped in sentimentality, but that said the film remains engaging and enjoyable throughout.

'The Iron Horse' is perhaps Ford's most famous silent film and even today it remains above the majority of other silent Westerns of the era, mainly due to Ford's infamous landscape shots on location. The film never feels faux and the retelling of the great birth of the transcontinental railway is given the epic treatment the story deserves. Perhaps some scenes are a bit hokey, but for any Ford fan, this is a great place to start with his silent movies, as most of the themes and techniques used here, would become a staple of Ford's later films. This copy includes 2 different versions (I would recommend the full 150 minute cut).

I haven't watched the other 2 films yet, but am looking to watch Hangman's House with John Wayne's screen debut and Ford stalwart Victor Mclaglen starring. I only knocked 1 star of this set, because of the movietone omission on 4 sons, this was a glaring error by Fox and I hope one day they will issue the other version on it's own.",1475625600,,2109,4.515706806282722

Hangman's House is stylistic tour de force, heavily influenced by Murnau it is Ford at a visual peak.  Victor McLaglen does a nice turn here as well, one can feel a strong screen presence here long before he became a caricature of a drunken Irishman in later years.  (Come to think of it, even his drunken Irishmen had a strong presence as well).
The Iron Horse is an epic that must be seen by every film buff, it's reputation as a sweeping large scale production does not disappoint.  3 Bad Men is also a quintessential Western of its day and exhibits much of the folksy humor that Ford would display for the rest of his film life.
I've still yet to process the remaining two but, recommendation-wise, if one were to consider buying The Iron Horse separately one would be better off buying this box for a few extra bucks for the inclusion of Hangman's House.  I'm glad I did.",1364860800,7,1076,4.41919191919192
8223804,4,B000WMA6IC,"This is a dvd set really worth purchasing for those who love silent movies and for all vintage movie buffs. The two highlight films are ""The Iron Horse"" (1924) which has two versions. The international version, which is shorter than the american version, which runs two and a half hours. This truly is the first great epic western and certainly John Ford's. Tall and handsome George O'Brien stars in this and ""3 Bad Men"" (1926), a big star particularly in the twenties. J. Farrell MacDonald also features prominently in ""The Iron Horse"" and ""3 Bad Men"", a great charactor actor, who played a lot of irish policemen , with a sense of humour, in the thirties. The other highlight film is ""Four Sons"" (1928) which features James Hall, who was to later star in Howard Hughes' ""Hell's Angels"" (1930). I was disappointed that ""Four Sons"" did not have the originally recorded music and sound effects soundtrack ( which was featured in the ""Hollywood"" tv series in the seventies, about silent cinema), however the new score created for all the movies was excellent.""Hangman's House"" (1928) is also a great Ford film starring the legendary Victor McLaglen, who later starred in the classic Ford film ""The Informer""(1935). Interesting to note that in ""Hangman's House"", featured in his first film appearance ,is John Wayne, clearly glimpsed in a crowd scene. For all those who collect John Wayne movies, I bet you don't have this one.""Just Pals"" (1920) is an early example of Ford's magnificent directing and shows just how far back his career really went. All movies are digitally remastered with a crystal clear picture quality , for such vintage films. I wish, though, that they had given some extra features and sound over reviews, however this dvd set is really worth getting and I know you vintage movie buffs, out there, won't be disappointed, as I was delighted.",1216080000,9,1860,4.889240506329114
