2878743,3,B000S1KUME,"This is the second Nora Roberts adaptation that I've seen, after ""Angels Fall"", and the first one where I've read the book. The book Blue Smoke was pretty good but not without flaws, and the movie shares some of its flaws. The biggest one is how long it takes for Reena to figure out who her nemesis is (although this was less obvious in the movie than in the book). One bad thing that the movie adds is that the climax feels more silly than suspenseful (especially because the bad guy actor speaks in a really silly voice, supposedly because he had cancer - anyway it was way too over-the-top).

I did like this movie better than ""Angels Fall"", which somehow felt cheaper. Alicia Witt did a pretty good job playing Reena, but the best performance was by the still very beautiful Talia Shire playing her mother. But overall, it's an average tv-movie, no better or worse than most of its kind, but definitely not good enough for a theatrical release. Recommended for Roberts fans and fans of romantic suspense made-for-tv-movies. Others needn't bother.",1190678400,8,1051,4.711956521739131
2878744,1,B000S1KUME,"I hope the book was better, because this movie had an unbelievably terrible script, terrible acting (even from Scott Bakula) - I've rarely heard lines delivered so badly from an ensemble, but not only are the lines ridiculously bad, they're spoken badly, too, by almost every character) - and not much of a mystery. Makes me believe the book was written by a 12-year-old, unless the teleplay was just butchered. The pacing was too slow, the characters were ridiculous (the main character cannot seem to focus on getting out of a ""fire maze"" alive ... what an idiot; her love interest, Goodnight, follows a ridiculously puerile fairy tale arc; and so on). Ghastly.",1190332800,2,663,4.876106194690266
2878745,3,B000S1KUME,"Readers of Nora Roberts books will doubtless want to watch this adaptation of one of her popular novels (to date there are four of her books translated into made for television movies).  The story, as adapted by Ronni Kern, is straight forward with enough of a mixture of love scenes and action scenes to please the audience. No, this is not a major league film, but it is made with a fine cast of actors who bring the drama to life.

Reena Hale (Alicia Witt) watched as her family's pizzeria burned to the ground after a scuffle between Reena's father Gib (Eric Keenleyside) and neighbor Joe Pastorelli (David Brown).  Pastorelli is convicted of arson and swears to get even.  Jump years later and Reena is now an arson investigator under the tutelage of Officer John Minger (Scott Bakula) who had solved the case in Reena's family's loss.  Once credentialed, Reena finds herself stalked by an arsonist who just happens to include two of Reena's boyfriends as victims of deaths by fire.  The story is a search and destroy mission to discover the identity of the arsonist and Reena is aided by her newest love interest Bo Goodnight (Matthew Settle) in a taut, well paced and well filmed adventure: if the identity of the arsonist is rather apparent early on, that doesn't diminish the suspense  aspect of the film.

The supporting cast includes fine actor Talia Shire as Reena's mother, a role that adds a touch of human comedy as well as unconditional love that lifts the story just when it needs grounding, as well as some very fine fresh faces with promise.  David Carson directs the many fire scenes with a good sense of 'reality' and delivers a sound message about the worth of arson investigators and firemen. But in the end it is Alicia Witt's movie and she carries her character well.  Good entertainment.  Grady Harp, September 07",1189814400,10,1839,4.733542319749216
2878746,4,B000S1KUME,"This is a good, entertaining movie, but the book is better. There are several storylines and characters missing, but none that really hurt the storyline. My biggest dissapointment was that they really under-developed the character of Pasterolli, who I believe is one of Robert's best villians in the books.

Characters not included in the movie are Reena's partner, McDonnal, Reena's sister, Bella, as well as Bella's husband, and Reena's ex-boyfriend Luke.

Some of the details have changed, such as the deaths of some of the characters. Though the same characters still die, (I won't say who, for those that haven't read the book,) but they die differently.

The book is more suspenseful then the movie. The movie is good as a stand-alone, but don't expect it to be better then the book.",1189641600,2,789,4.962121212121212
2878747,4,B000S1KUME,"""Blue smoke"" is a fast paced film, based on a novel of the same name written by Nora Roberts. This movie has ingredients of mystery and romance, and is likely to please those that are just looking for entertainment.

The main character is Reena (Alicia Witt), a young woman that doesn't like fire but  decides to turn into an arson investigator in order to fight her fear. Things aren't easy for her, though, as she loses people she cares about to fire. Traumatized, Reena begins to suspect that a pyromaniac is stalking her, waiting to kill the people she loves. But is Reena right, or is her imagination too active?

All in all, I think that ""Blue smoke"" is a movie you shouldn't miss if you are a fan of Robert's books, and one you will probably like if you are not. From my point of view, this is not an outstanding film, but I believe it is good enough to engage your attention, and keep it. That is the reason why I give ""Blue smoke"" 3.5 stars.

2878763,4,B000S1KUME,"This is one of those television movies that is pretty good and is for someone who like romance with something else within it to keep their interest.
This is basically about Rina Hale, a woman who loves fire but hates how it has hurt both her and her family, so she becomes an arson investigator.  Meanwhile, Beau, a guy who has seen her only once, is in love with her but has no idea who she is.  In her life, both Rina's first real boyfriend and her fiance to be Hugh were killed in fires and Rina suspects that it was done by the same person.  So Rina investigates and won't let up.  Rina ends up moving next door to Beau and after hearing his incredible story they very quickly get into a relationship.  Rina also figures out that she was never a direct target, but the people she cares about have been.
Rina tries to scare Beau off.  But, he won't go away.  Rina finally figures out that the person doing all of this is a boy that she knew as a child who loves fire just as much as she does.  This boy, Joey, now a man, ambushes Rina in her own house.  He admits to killing her boyfriends and tells her that he has terminal cancer.  Joey tries to burn them both alive and Beau arrives just in time to help Rina save both him and herself.  Joey dies in the fire.

At this point she decides she wants to be a fire-fighter when she grows up. She becomes even more determined to pursue this career after incidents that happen to her in college. Her boyfriend Josh (John Reardon) is burnt to death in his apartment - seemingly an accident caused by the lighted candles he used. In school she was bullied by Joey Pastorelli. Her father had an argument with Joe Pastorelli Sr. about this and he is subsequently arrested for the pizzeria fire. Reena is now a fire investigator working for the police under the mentorship of John Minger (Scott Bakula).

2878769,4,B000S1KUME,"This made-for-TV adaptation of ""Blue Smoke"" is by far the best translation of book to movie in the Nora Roberts collection. In particular, strong performances from Alicia Witt and Matthew Settle anchor a solid story, one focused as much on the fire investigations Reena pursues as her growing relationship with Bo. Settle has the perfect blend of puppy-dog loyalty and strong, secure masculinity to portray the blue-collar hero who fell in love at first sight, and Witt's intensely focused Reena is well balanced by the soft, sad memories that haunt her. Scott Bakula shines in the role of Reena's mentor, grounding her but letting her take the lead. Talia Shire is the fiery matriarch of Reena's family; unusually for Roberts, here she gives us a heroine embedded in a loving, close family.

It's not all that hard to figure out who the villain is, but that's beside the point in a romance. The real focus of this story is on the feisty, never-say-die heroine, a woman finding her way in a traditional man's career, with drive and energy. Roberts has a penchant for these strong women -- Eve Dallas, Phoebe MacNamara, and a host of other overcaffeinated but sensitive heroines populate her books. Reena is another in this mold, a woman whose gradual discovery of real love brought me back to the book, and to this movie, several times.",1308614400,,1336,4.834061135371179
2878770,1,B000S1KUME,"Having recently seen the movie ""Something Borrowed,"" I grew curious about Colin Egglesfield and saw he would be in Carnal Innocence, another Roberts adaption. Read the book, saw the movie and was pretty satisfied with the outcome so I decided to invest in the other books-to-movie adaptions. So far it's been a pretty big disappointment, starting with Blue Smoke.

I couldn't have been more devastated when I found out that Alicia Witt was to play Reena. I have nothing against Miss Witt, but the girl cannot act to save her life, in addition to the fact that Reena is supposed to have a bundle of curly blonde hair. How hard would it have been to find a blonde actress for the part? She was completely unbelievable in the role and it was just overall very disappointing.

Granted, I can't pass full judgment as I didn't continue watching the movie, but it's rare for me to stop only twenty minutes or so in and not pick it back up.

I found Bo to be an idiot in the movie and he definitely wasn't what I envisioned for Bo Goodnight. I was really disappointed with the acting in the movie. There have been plenty of Lifetime movies that have had good acting, but this was not one of them. If you want a good/better movie adaptation of a Nora Roberts book, check out Carolina Moon and/or Carnal Innocence. I may finish this movie some day, but I doubt it. I'd rather have the world I created in my own head than the mess viewers were given instead.",1308268800,2,1447,4.452830188679245

Granted the ending was similar to the book, and a few parts, like Bo seeing Reena for the first time matched the book, but that's pretty much were it ended.  A lot of liberties were taken with the manuscript and a lot of characters were either changed, hence the firefighter Hugh went from a couple dates in the book and being shot and burnt to he and Reena being engaged and him blown up in a florist shop, and other good characters left out all together.  Also, the cat and mouse game of who was setting the fires was greatly played down to the point the plot was virtually lost.

So it is no surprise as we flash forward and we see that she has become an arson investigator herself.

8203863,3,B000S1KUME,"This is a likely made for TV movie.  If you're finding this in physical stores these days you're only paying a couple of dollars for it, it's amongst a wide range of budget DVDs with a big name to get you to pick it up. In fact you can also get this one with three other movies based on Nora Roberts books for the same couple of dollars price the other single movies go for. So I base my rating on the fact you're likely only paying a dollar or two for this or watching it on TV. Of course if you're buying this in a few years time and having to pay a regular movie DVD price or even more, well you might be a bit more critical. But for me, for a cheap budget movie, Blue Smoke, although not as good as Angels Falls and Montana Sky, two of the other three 4 pack movies I've watched so far, is a lot better most of the other movies you'll get for the same price.

Following the formula the cast including the lead are pretty much unknown actors, with the big pay cheque obviously going to Scott Bakula (NCIS New Orleans, although he was obviously famous from other TV shows as Blue Smoke was released in 2007), to have some sort of guaranteed return from fans of the shows he was in.  He's not the main character though, he's the fire investigator chief, the main character is Reena (played by Alicia Witt).  Reena as a girl watched her parent's pizza restaurant burn to the ground and was fascinated by the flames.  She met Bakula when sneaking under the caution tape who told her she was very observant and now as an adult is one of his employees.  However she's also constantly freaking out when seeing flames, since a guy she slept with when at a teen party burnt to death in the bed that she helped light ridiculously over sized candles nearby to set the mood, and because as we said they both knew she loved flames.  Now in her adult life any guy who seems interested in her also meets a crispy demise.  The point of the film is we the viewer are supposed to work out who of the men in her life is the one who is murdering these guys.  Or perhaps it's even her as we've seen in many similar telemovies, sometimes the victim is just crazy.  I found this premise really didn't hold up long into the movie, I also found the lead character to be too ditzy to really care much about her survival or happiness either.  When her kid was a character she was really intelligent and strong willed, but the adult version was almost a bimbo.  The second murder also was very cheaply shot, it was obvious video game like computer graphics on top of the shot footage.

I kind of can't really talk more about why this was only really an average movie, even for a made for TV film without giving away spoilers, so if you haven't seen it yet but likely still will, I'd stop reading this review here.

I actually thought two characters were the same one as the two actors looked so similar, until the florist shop bombing victim was killed, and we see the party love at first sight guy again running to her car in the snow when she's stopped at an intersection.  Surely they could found two slightly more different looking actors than these two.  At times Reena wasn't the only really dumb character, early in the film some other bimbo sits on a stove with high flames, now if it was just a regular hot plate that was left on for some reason and she didn't know that would be one thing, but these were high flames.  The end scenes were also ridiculous, what was with the pointy stick out ears and weird voice of her stalker. Would have blended in a bit more if he just talked and looked normal.  How did he know the fireman was going to buy flowers to set a bomb in that shop?  How did she not think the guy who tried to rape her as a kid was not the main suspect?  How did she not even mention this occurred to everyone else trying to find her stalker?

Does fire training in the US really involve a game of finding hidden doors and fake walls and crawling over the top of monkey bars with huge flames underneath while running out air where if you fail you will at least be severely burnt if not die.  And if so would you really let a woman you know freezes and goes into memory flashbacks where she isn't aware of the current world for long periods of time when she sees a particularly interesting flame wobble, do that course?",1457913600,,4317,4.232643118148599
