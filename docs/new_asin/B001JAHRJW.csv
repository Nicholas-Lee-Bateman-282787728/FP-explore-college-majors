8312641,4,B001JAHRJW,"I loved Picket Fences when it aired on TV back when I was a high school kid in the 90s. I always remembered the quirkiness of the show and some of the episodes that tackled by putting a mirror up so to speak for reflections on opinions of the time,and how society dealt with them, through the plot. It also showed how possible scientific breakthroughs might affect the law in the future on some issues. Season 3 has no extras, just the episodes, a lot of times the picture is stretched or squashed to fit the widescreen format, but all of Season 3's episodes are on here. Season 3 starts off with a pretty weak episode where Kenny appeals to a suspect's religious side to tell him where the body is after his lawyer (Wambaugh) tells him not to speak to the police. Should this testimony and everything it turned up be thrown out is the question argued before Judge Bone. This storyline will pop up every now and then throughout later episodes as well.

Then we get to the busing episodes where a state judge has ordered kids from a poor high crime area in Greenbay be bused two hours away into Rome where they will attend school amongst Rome's kids. Of course Rome wouldn't be Rome if they didn't object to dark skinned kids being bused in so Jill (acting mayor) and Jimmy will of course make the situation worse than it would have been by simply allocating more resources to the school for the extra kids. Whenever I have thought of Picket Fences over the years I have always remembered the school buses and the over the top police in riot gear scenes. The season is worth getting for the episodes revolving around this topic including Zachary's racist school report (which he innocently believes to be the truth after reading racist information in an old encyclopedia) as well as the scene in a later episode with how he reacts to the fallout with some angry dark skinned kids in the bathroom. These are also scenes I'd remembered all these years, you know a show was good when it does that.

But as I mentioned Season three has a few duller episodes after the bus ones revolving back to the events of episode one that have D.A. Littleton and Wambaugh getting to go to the supreme court. But season three redeems itself with probably Picket's most bizarre episode ever, that starts off with Carter insisting that he gets to have a look at a farmers cows because he insists he's heard DNA from aliens is being injected into them. Of course what is really going on is way more bizarre.

Other interesting stuff you might remember from when you watched this in the 90's, the Squiggly secret that most women in town have been enjoying and how this affects everyone in town when a little black book is discovered at a murder scene which is the second death in a run on body's found in a certain kitchen appliance. One of the previous season's character's on the DVD cover is the first victim, so it is a bit odd that they appear on the cover of this DVD set, when they, other than their corpse weren't in the entire season at all.

Kenny and Kimberly decide to date, which of course doesn't impress Jimmy one bit. A woman is accused of witchcraft and therefore the question can she be a fit parent? Jill has a couple of bad episodes in a row starting when she punches Matthew in the face after he get into their car trying to move it so they can play ice hockey and nearly kills Zachary when he puts it in drive instead of reverse. Jill can't cope with the fact Matthew won't accept her apology which was delievered in her usual well you know it was your fault tone, when he tells her he hates her and evidentally hasn't felt loved by her for quite some time. She in a later episode is put on trial for murder after Jimmy decides to crack down on Rome citizens living secret lives of crime by ordering autopsies on anyone who died. The priest and pastor hope not but suspect Zachary may have experienced the Stigmata. The Brock boys decide to take part in a hockey game using a swan instead of a puck, Wambaugh finally decides he has some morals when he refuses to help a man who is being discriminated by citizens of Rome against due to crimes he did against children and was jailed for who has moved to Rome upon his release. Judge Bone has his own reasons for not liking the man.

Season three doesn't have as many well known guest appearances that filled the first two seasons, but does have Jane Kaczmarek (Lois, Malcolm in the Middle) who comes to town expecting a slam dunk trial prosecution win after The Dancing Bandit fugitive (Marlee Matlin, Deaf Lineswoman Seinfeld) returns and is arrested visiting Zachary on his birthday. A younger Mandy Patinkin that he is in shows he would later become a household name in (Dead Like Me, Homeland, Criminal Minds) plays a brilliant medical specialist surgeon at Chicago Hope hospital who Jill doesn't like at all because he's everything she's not, when she takes one of Rome's most well known residents there for treatment and expects to boss everyone around the surgeon won't do what she says or agree with her.

Season three ends with a rather boring town play episode that starts off interestingly when a kid takes an uzi into the confession box but gets pretty boring after that.

Picket Fences was one of the most quirkiest shows on TV, at times such as The Busing episodes we see glimpses of its brilliance that was in seasons one and two, but at others it seems to have run out of ideas and just plods along with instead of quirky happenings, they are substituted for Brock family dilemmas involving Kimberly's biological mother, Jimmy's dad and things like this during this third season. It's a shame there's no interviews with the cast who are still alive, audio commentaries or any extras at all on this DVD.

Still there's one more season to wait to come out on DVD and relive after all these years and I very much look forward to it.",1458864000,,5893,4.490671641791045

ALL OF THAT ASIDE - IT WAS A WONDEROUS SHOW FOR 3 SEASONS, WONDERFUL CHARACTERS, GREAT QUIRKY STORIES, AND RATHER INTELLEGENT DISCUSSIONS ON TOPICS THAT ARE STILL RELEVANT FOR DISCUSSION TODAY. GREAT IDEA HAVING LAW AND MEDICINE AT LOGGERHEADS IN THE ONE FAMILY - CUTE KIDS - CARTER IS A RIOT - MAXINE IS A STUNNER AND FUNNY AS A FIT ALL DECKED OUT IN HER RIOT GEAR - KENNY'S ""THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE MOMENTS ARE A SCREAM; AND THE OLD BEAUTIFUL JEWISH LAYWER IS A LAUGH A MINUTE - PRICELESS FIND IN THAT GREAT ACTOR - AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE JUDGE IS A FANTASTIC ANCHOR FOR THE WHOLE SHEBANG-
WHAT A SHOW AND WHAT A SHAME TO WHATEVER COMPANY OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THIS SHOW THAT THEY HAVE STILL NOT PUT THE WHOLE THING OUT ON DISC ALREADY. THE ONE SHOW I HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING NO MATTER HOW LATE IN THE NIGHT IT GETS - ONE OF THOSE RARE 'JUST ONE MORE EPISODE BEFORE BEDTIME' SHOWS.
THE MUSIC IS ALSO WONDERFUL.
WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT SHOWS THAT ARE LABELLED ""THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THAT ANYMORE"" HOWEVER, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS WHERE SUCH A LABEL IS ACCURATE, (I WOULD ALSO ADD NOTHERN EXPOSURE TO THAT SHORT LIST - IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, GET IT IMMEDIATELY - SAME OLD NEW AGE LEFT WING TWADDLE, BUT PRICELESS CHARACTERS AND STORIES ALL THE SAME, THE EPISODE ""SLOW DANCE"" HAS AN ENDING THAT RANKS WITH THE ENDING OF CASABLANCA - I KID YOU NOT!).

8312647,5,B001JAHRJW,"With crap like the TV version of Casablanca being released, and even failed shows like The River, not to mention such ""classics"" of ""great"" television as Petticoat Junction, Gilligan's Island, and (I wouldn't be a bit surprised) My Mother The Car, why, oh WHY can't the rest of Picket Fences be available?

I mean, it's not like it was the GREATEST show ever to air on U.S. television.  Oh, wait, IT WAS!

So, could someone explain why it hasn't been released?  Who should we blackmail, extort, or even KILL to get this done?

(Of course, that would be wrong.)",1341446400,5,560,4.616161616161616
