8485869,4,B005T5OBKQ,"Limited selection of shows... does show impact of cable.  Denies mentioning that cable is a commercial transaction...not exactly like Cadillac and cornflakes, but cable sells entertainment to mass audiences who can or will watch mesmerizing insanity, much the way a hanging, beheading or public humiliation/execution fascinated crowds of earlier centuries.

The comment by Edie Falco that the Sopranos was about a ""family"" had me reaching for a flight bag to puke.
It reminded me of the old joke:
""So, Mrs. Lincoln, otherwise, how did you like the play?""",1441324800,,554,5.284090909090909
8485870,5,B005T5OBKQ,"I grew up watching  most of the shows and performers in this series and it only points out to me how the artistic development of  television has stymied. Though the ratings were important for most of the shows/people included in this retrospective, it was also the a pride in ones performance as an artist/writer/director etc. I learned and relearned about the hey-day of television and the artists who have made most of what we now see possible, though we don't live up to the previous standards. Enjoyable, educational, and a must for budding actors, film makers, writers and the list goes on and on. Watch and you will laugh, cry and learn much about the performing arts, not just television.",1382486400,,695,4.783333333333333
8485871,5,B005T5OBKQ,"If you don't see this you will miss out on a wonderful experience.  The documentary tracks TV from the post WWII era to the present day and if you were watching over the decades you will not only appreciate the well edited clips from various shows you have watched and loved but also the comments from directors, actors and writers are entertaining and informative.  I saw it on TV but was so impressed I am going to buy the DVD so I can watch it again.  Enjoy.",1355097600,,461,4.275862068965517
8485872,5,B005T5OBKQ,This has been one of the most informative and entertaining documentary series I have ever seen. I must have in any 20th century social historian's collection.,1351555200,,158,5.115384615384615
8485873,4,B005T5OBKQ,"PBS continues to mine the archives of commercial TV to create new documentaries about its competitor. In 2002 they created a program titled ""Pioneers of Television"". This was followed on 2008 by a four part series ""Pioneers of Prime Time"". This new four-part, four-hour, series focuses on new shows, while briefly remembering the past. Depending on your age, you probably are familiar with either the shows of the 1950s and early 60s (""Father Knows Best"", ""Leave it To Beaver"", ""The Rifleman"" and ""Dragnet""). Or the newer series - mostly on cable (""The Sopranos"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", ""24"", ""House"" and ""Weeds""). Not having cable TV, many of the newer shows were unfamiliar to me, but may not be for you. Still I'm willing to bet that, after watching this series., there will be shows you've only heard of that you'll look for either on TV, hulu or on DVD sets.

The series is divided into chapter on the ""man of the house"" (from ""Father Kows Best"" to ""All in the Family"" to Tony on ""The Sopranos""), ""The Independent Woman"" (from Lucy and Mary Tyler Moore to Roseanne and on to ""The Good Wife"", ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Weeds""0, ""The Misfits (""Taxi"", ""The Office"", ""30 Rock"" and ""Glee"") and ""The Crusader"" (from Joe Friday on ""Dragnet"" to ""Homicide: Life on The Street"", ""NYPD Blue"" and on to ""Dexter"" - with sops at ""MASH"" and ""Superman"").

There are many interviews with actors, directors and writers (and Rob Reiner fills all three shoes) as well as short clips. The story is interesting and will certainly appeal to pop culture folks (of which I count myself among them.)

There are few weakness which resulted in my four star rating. For one, the font used to identify those being interviewed (important in cases of writers or directors who are not easily identified by their face) is way too small, too fancy, and in yellow, making them hard to read. And they go by fast! The other issue is the music. Possibly because of ""rights"" issues, there is virtually no original music from the shows to accompany the clips. There is a completely new score. Imagine seeing the title scene from ""The Rifleman"" or ""NYPD blue"" without the iconic theme, I think I heard ONE original TV theme in the four hours. These TV themes are part of the DNA of classic TV shows.

The bonus feature - there is just one - consists of interview outtakes with 20 of those interviewed in the series. These total 35 minutes so they are aren't - individually - very long but still fun to watch.

If you missed the series when it aired on PBS, you'll enjoy watching it on DVD. And you will probably find yourself making a list of series you want to buy on DVD sets.

I hope you found this review both helpful and entertaining.

8485874,5,B005T5OBKQ,"PBS's documentary series ""America in Primetime"" features original interviews with some of the best minds that TV and film have to offer, painting a picture of the evolution of American television across the last 60 years: David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Dr.), Matthew Weiner (Mad Men), Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad), David Chase (The Sopranos), Diablo Cody (Juno, The United States of Tara), James Manos Jr. (The Sopranos, Dexter), Alan Ball (Six Feet Under, True Blood), and many other notable creators of television.

""America in Primetime"" is entertaining and educational, and an insightful look into the medium of narrative television.
