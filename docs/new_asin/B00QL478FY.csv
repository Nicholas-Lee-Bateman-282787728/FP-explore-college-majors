6876389,5,B00QL478FY,"Although the resetting in the Paris Opera house loses some of the sweep of the more traditional setting, it flows well, sings well, and the forces are well controlled , as usual, by Pappano. Any plans for Les Huguenauts or L'Africaine?",1427328000,,235,4.7560975609756095
6876390,4,B00QL478FY,"This is a beautiful performance excellently sung by both chorus and principal singers, although it seemed Lianna Haroutounian's voice could not meet all of Verdi's demands. In her aria ""Arrigo ah parler  un noyau"" the lowest notes were interpolated to higher pitches in that famous descending passage which covers over two octaves, I suspect because her voice was inaudible at the lowest pitches. But that is a minor quibble. Also, at the very end of the opera the character Procida, sung by bass Erwin Schrott appears in a gown, out of his character. The staging has many surprises throughout but musically it is superlative.",1427068800,6,626,5.019230769230769

6876392,2,B00QL478FY,"Verdi's 19th opera is infrequently performed, its splendid overture, however, a concert hall favorite.  For the 1855 premier in Paris, the composer included an obligatory ballet, ""The Seasons"", containing Verdi's richest and most extensive dance music which anticipated Tchaikovsky in many of the melodic woodwind passages.  Originally choreographed by Petipa, there have been newer versions choreographed by MacMillan, Prokovsky and Jerome Robbins.

Verdi later authorized the ballet to be deleted from the opera if desired, reducing the opera's length by some 30 minutes - but even with the ballet included the opera is considerably shorter than the likes of Die Walkure and Les Troyens.  It is a pity that the Royal Opera House management chose to cut The Seasons - it might have helped (particularly if danced by the incomparable Royal Ballet) to redeem one of the most damnable productions ever staged at Covent Garden.

As a conductor of Verdi, Pappano is without equal.  The principals are excellent, the chorus splendid, the orchestra superb.  The set, a theater within a theater (by no means original) is impressive but, with only minor variations, after two hours becomes claustrophobic.

With the opening bars of the overture there is the realization that under Pappano's direction and modern recording techniques we are hearing this famous piece as never before.  Suddenly, rudely, our concentration is shattered with a bevy of ballerinas mincing around the stage, who, as the music intensifies, are ravished by militia.  It is a very busy stage, the music lost.  Before the overture reaches its conclusion the audience is subjected to a brutal rape, center stage.

In the first Act we are distracted by Helene wandering around the stage carrying the decapitated head of her dear brother in an obvious state of advanced decomposition (the darling brother, not Helene) before it finally becomes used as a football.  The ballerinas mindlessly come and go, as they do in every scene, serving no purpose other than to distract.

The opera has been re-set in 1855 or so we are told.  In the scene where beheading is imminent, surely a guillotine would have been appropriate?  Instead, a medieval execution block and ax appear on stage along with a silly little 10 year old - or thereabouts - cupid as an executioner.  It was hoped that cupid would reward viewers by beheading the choreographer and director.  Alas no!  There is worse to come: towards the end of the opera Procida returns to the stage, this time in full drag, very fetching.  Could it be Conchita Wurst recreating her Eurovision triumph?  Or Baba the Turk from The Rake's Progress who has wandered onto the wrong stage?.

Far removed from the world's great opera houses down here in the South Pacific, perhaps we are too unsophisticated - or not jaded enough - to appreciate the growing tendency to reduce operatic masterpieces to the absurd.  The appreciative audience at Covent Garden would suggest that it could be a different experience far removed from the stage to be distracted by endless aberrations, than those of us who can only experience great operas on video.  With filming in high definition, extreme close-ups and viewed on large ultra high definition screens, the absurdities in opera performances like Les Vepres Siciliennes, such as the decapitated, decomposing head, the brutal rape, Procida in drag - and lets not forget those bloody ballerinas - are so full in your face that there's no escape.

After a grotesque Flying Dutchman from Nederlands Opera followed by a nonsensical version from Zurich (despite Tyrfel and Salminen), an outrageously awful staging of Lohengrin from Munich which not even Kaufmann and Harteros could save, and a pretentious 1960's Las Vegas-style Rigoletto from the Met, we now have a performance from hallowed Covent Garden, which, combined with the aforementioned, is more than enough to deter opera lovers from purchasing any new releases in high definition.  We are better off enjoying our collection of great recordings on CD.  If the manufacturers of blu-ray and dvd want us to continue purchasing their new opera releases, then give us back operas the way their composers intended them to be produced.",1426896000,39,4229,5.126822157434402
6876393,5,B00QL478FY,"Les Vepres Siciliennes is one of Verdi's middle operas and his first written in French, written in 1854 for the Paris Exposition of 1855 and was well received at the Paris Opera. It was shortly afterwards translated into Italian for the Italian premiere.
The topic is the 13th century Sicilian revolt against the occupying French troops,and the conflicts between politics and personal affiliations.
It followed Rigoletto, Il Trovatore and La Traviata but has not proven as popular. Despite some excellent writing, it's a longer work, includes a ballet and is harder to cast, as the hero role is for a high tenor. It doesn't have as many portable arias, many arias written for voice and chorus or as duos/trios and more dependent on context.
The hero Henri (Arrigo in the Italian version) here is sung by Bryan Hymel with an incredible lyric-heroic French Tenor voice and technique to burn. His voice opens as the pitch ascends, much like that of Escalais a century before. All the principal voices are big, flexible and well shaded. Hymel fits in well.
A newcomer to video is the heroine Helene (Elena) in sung by Lianna Haroutounian and another great find, with a big rich soprano voice, that reminds of Cheryl Studer, who sang the role in the 1991 La Scala production.
Monfort is sung by Michael Volle with a powerful, well centered voice, even better than his Salzburg Hans Sachs.
The Procida is Erwin Schrott who does well although the role is often taken by a lower bass. He has the voice and does a good job filling even that large a house.
All four voices are well matched and they are all effective actors as well.

The Director, Stefan Herheim has contributed a superb production. The setting is the Paris Opera of the 1850s and is ambiguous enough to be supportive and harmonious of the action and the other concepts he sees running through the story.
One device Herheim uses involves dancers to fill in parts of the story not in the libretto during the prelude and instrumental interludes. The long third Act ballet has been broken and the music used for short ballet interludes to clarify the story where the libretto skips over details.
The level of production given this opera is in contrast with the more modest productions on the other videos available. It brings additional dimensions to the opera and this becomes the version of choice. Even without comprehending it yet I know there is much there still to discover, and the level of physicality and dramatic expression of the principals brings the story to life.

Pappano and the orchestra are superb and well recorded; the stage is recorded in perspective without noticeable body mics. Solos are brought closer but not where the chorus is also involved. There is subtle spaciousness but little directionality, which is about what you'd hear from a decent seat.
The booklet has a readable essay looking into Verdi's thoughts on ""theatrical truth"" and the artists' place. Herheim uses ballerinas on stage as well as the usual peasant-costumed dancers to develop those concepts.
Of the six video productions available, this is the second in the original French. The other French language production from de Nederlandse Oper offers a production that is intrusive, austere and frankly revolting. No longer competitive.
The Studer/Muti/La Scala, Nizza/Renzani/Busseto and Dessi/Zanetti/Parma videos are all in Italian in smaller houses and all have their strengths and attractions, but they can't match the sweep, drama and depth of this new Pappano set.",1425945600,20,3518,4.9812925170068025
8691833,5,B00QL478FY,"This is a compeltely underperformed opera from verdi's middle period.  The plot makes ZERO sense, but the music is absolutely glorious and Bryan Hymel and Michael Volle are masterful in their roles.  The production is exhilarating.  I am very fond of the productions of Stephan Herheim.",1457136000,,286,5.173913043478261
8691834,5,B00QL478FY,Verdi's opera written to a French libretto! I didn't know this. Music is beautiful nonetheless! Wonderfully performed and in a great setting too.,1447200000,,145,5.3478260869565215
8691835,5,B00QL478FY,"Well, it was between this production and theNetherland's, so I went for this one.  Having no preconceived notions, I found quite easy to accept the mise-en-scene, which I expected, from having read the reviews, to be much worse.  I loved the way ballet was used much more creatively than in the original.  And I loved the singing.  First, there was Callas.  Then Caballe.  I have the Italian version with Studer, which I also love.  By the way, it is among my favorite Verdi operas!!!!!",1443225600,2,486,4.714285714285714
8691836,5,B00QL478FY,"A really god recording of an excellent opera. I Saw Thisted in Copenhagen, and I must admit that I like non-traditional staging of operas. The singers are all very good. All in all - Worth listening to and watcing.",1436572800,,214,4.512820512820513
8691837,5,B00QL478FY,"This is a well sung account of the opera in a rather controversial production.  To heighten the drama, the third act ballet is left out but ballerinas dace in most acts.  They portray the Sicilian people. I and a friend found the production very dramatic and were quite moved by what we experienced.  Others have expressed their hate for it.

By the way, the Blu-ray did not play on my machine and so I had to get the DVD version.  It plays on other Blu-ray players however.",1436400000,,474,4.402298850574713
8691838,4,B00QL478FY,"There is much to recommend this recording of Verdi's grand opera ""Les Vepres Siciliennes"". First of all it's done in French the language in which the libretto was written. This was Verdi's attempt to write a ""grand opera"" a la Meyerbeer for the grandest opera house in the world: L'Opera, Paris. The sets and concept of an opera within an opera house is clever. Contrary to what it says in the production notes included in this recording, this was not Verdi's first opera written in French for the Paris opera. The first was called Jerusalem and premiered 22 November 1847 long before Les Vepres of 1855. However Les Vepres Siciliennes was the first in the old French Grand Opera style - and grand it is with five acts and full ballet.
Having Rigoletto, Trovatore and Traviata under his belt, Verdi was master of music and drama; a man of the theater where truth is what you make it. There are few separate arias in this opera (no. 20) because the drama and music are so intricately melded together.
The cast is almost ideal. The Henri of Bryon Hymel is exquisite! His performance during the recognition scene  with Monfort; enemy, adversary is in reality your father, is gripping. His pleading with Helene that he loves her and Sicily even if he is the son of the oppressor is superbly emotional. The extremely well sung and acted Monfort of Michael Volle was so moving that you could almost feel that he had a human side to him. Lianna Haroutounian was a little weak of voice for the part of Helene. Her voice has a nice sound to it but is not large enough with all the other large voices on stage. Erwin Schrott was a good Jean Procida. the idealist patriot with a wide dull streak to him.
In the several other productions of this great opera (as I Vespri Siciliani) I have often complained about the lack of direction for the cast as there  was little action by the cast; just get into costume and park and bark your role. Here in this production directed by Stefan Herheim the problem is just the opposite; it's busy, busy, busy. Those ballerinas keep coming out of nowhere (there is no ballet!). They get literally raped and go away - only to come back again. I'm no prude, but the onstage rape by Monfort was beyond good taste. Suggestion of an event is much more effective than actually seeing it; particularly in the theater. Otherwise the sets, costumes, acting, brilliant orchestral playing under the brilliant Antonio Pappano is all great; this is truly Grand Opera.
""a note about Les Vepres Siciliennes and I Vespri Siciliani. This is no. 20 in the Verdi canon of 27 operas/ 32 with revisions. He  is a profound man of the theater as well as a master musician and composer. He had had one success in Paris with Jerusalem in 1847 but it was an Italian style opera and now he wanted to meet the challenge and succeed and master in the French Grand Opera Style. He consulted the leading French librettist of the tome Eugene Scribe. Among other things he suggested a reworking of the plot of an unperformed opera Duc d'Alba, a story about the cruel Spanish in the Netherlands but they changed it to an even of the cruel French in Sicily. The action of the opera (Les Vepres..) is a fable based on historical events. It takes place in 1282. Most of Italy is dominated by the Hohenstafen family in the Holy Roman Empire and had wanted to take over Naples and Sicily. They were opposed by the Pope who asked the French king Louis IX to send an army to save it from the Germans.  Louis sent Charles of Anjou to take over Naples and Sicily with Guy de Monfort as governor of Sicily. La Duchese Helene is the sister of Duke Frederick (of Austria) who is executed by the French. Jean Procida is a Sicilian  doctor who organizes some unsuccessful riots. The above is historical fact. The story in the opera is fiction. Uprisings against the autocratic French occurred several times in Sicily and the French were finally expelled. Jean Procida was in Aragon trying to enlist the Spanish to retake Sicily when some riots took place and with the help of the Spanish the French were expelled and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilys was set up in time. We are still in the 13th century however. Of the dozen or so recordings of the opera I know only a very few keep the action n the 13th century. This recording and most other move the action to the 1800s somewhere. Of course Montfort, Helene, Henri and Procida are all long since dead but this is theater afterall, anything goes!.",1431734400,5,4473,4.530940594059406
8691839,3,B00QL478FY,"Disclosure: I am a huge Verdi fan but nothing can ever save the first act of this opera: not a rape or other sexual shenanigans; not a superfluous and totally out of place ballet; not 4 first rate singers.

But even when, in the 2nd act, the opera - and Verdis music - finally take wings, Michael Volles superbly sung opening aria cannot be enjoyed because of the deathly distraction of his having to struggle with a totally extraneous, horrible little tyke. This half-naked thing"", later supposedly an executioner (!!), completely destroys an otherwise totally gripping prison scene.

And the final scene, where Procida first in disguise of a woman (why, for heavens sake?) and then busy  having his own little massacre by poking people to death with a French flag (???), is beyond the pale.

And then, where was Sicily? I still remember the Mets 1974 production- with Caballe, Gedda, Milnes and Diaz -  where the last scene had a huge sunny flight of stairs and a church at the top for the fatal bells to toll. This totally indoors opera could have taken place anywhere.

Its not Verdis best opera but with four truly outstanding singers and a basically conventional production, it could have been pretty wonderful. Why oh why cant directors leave well enough alone and have to throw in nothing but superfluous gimmicks that belong nowhere and have no place.",1431475200,3,1360,4.7905982905982905
8691840,4,B00QL478FY,"Vespri (Vepres) is probably my favorite Verdi opera, and I've long wanted to see the French version. I saw the ROH film at the movies last year and was excited to buy the blu-ray. Bryan Hymel is spectacular in his role, although quite chubby (baby weight?), and the rest are excellent. The downside is the production. The concept is interesting, but some of the stage images are laugh out loud ridiculous just when the tension is at its height. Highly recommended, but turn away from the screen at the last scene and enjoy the great music.",1429315200,,539,4.625
8691841,3,B00QL478FY,I still prefer the italian version and this recording seemed to drag on f o r e v e r.  Enough said....,1428451200,,103,3.6818181818181817
8691842,1,B00QL478FY,"I love opera and I love ballet, but I do not like many opera ballets even those created by the composer. I do not like the Gioconda, Faust, Don Carlo and Vespri ballets. I like most Russian operas ballets.  I feel that the use of the Overture to Vepres to present a shocking and disgusting sexual assault, to have Helen sing her first act aria with the half rotten head of her brother, later used as a football. and to hear O toi Palerme with a bunch of sylphides is unimaginable, senseless and preposterous. Compare this production with the beautiful Scala Vespri with Zancanaro, Merritt and Studer and you will forget the awaited recording of Vepres. I am not an English speaker and I can not express myself as well as I would like to discourage people from buying this DVD. I have not yet played the second disc, but I will probably play without video.",1427760000,14,855,4.480769230769231
