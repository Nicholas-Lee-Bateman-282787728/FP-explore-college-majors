3159846,4,B0016MJ6LA,"OK, the Ultimate Collection is pretty darn good and WWE wants to suck old time fans like me out of some more cash so they're going through with this ""Definitive Collection"".

The first thing we need to say here is that I am hoping for a comprehensive documentary on Flair and his career and life.  We got a darn good one on the Four Horsemen DVD but on the Ultimate Collection, Flair just talks and introduces matches and angles and then they show them.  Sure, he gives us a little insight on the motivation at the time but a guy like The Nature Boy needs the full documentary treatment like Dusty, HBK, and Bret have had on their DVD collections.  Plus, they need to do this or it isn't going to sell as well as the Ultimate Collection did because a lot of fans are going to hate the inevitable overlapping of matches between the two DVD sets.

They need to have the 1993 Starrcade career vs. WCW title match with Vader on this new set.  That to me was the most glaring omission from the Ultimate Collection.

Also, bet your bottom dollar that the run-up to this past Wrestlemania and emotional final match with HBK will be on the new set because Vince knows we are all going to go out and buy the WM24 DVD for Flair's HOF stuff and the final match and then he can soak us again a few months later for the Definitive Collection.  Why, because Ric Flair is the freaking man.

3159878,4,B0016MJ6LA,"The documentary portion of this is very good.  The matches are fun to watch but seem sort of random.  I think there would've been better and more historically significant offerings from the same time periods, even featuring the same opponents.",1463875200,,243,5.05

3159880,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I remember in my review for the ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" that I said Ric Flair was ""arguably"" the greatest of all time--but after watching the ""Definitive Collection"", it's hard to think of anyone who you could make an argument for against the Nature Boy. Quality wise, I think I might give the edge to the ""Ultimate Collection"" as far as match quality--but that collection used 3 Discs for matches, so naturally I think that would give it the edge, especially since some of Ric's greatest matches with the likes of Steamboat and Barry Windham were used.

But, the Definitive Collection gives us the fans, an all new documentary with the man himself--covering Disc 1--as Slick Ric reflects back on his legendary career; from the glory days of the NWA, to the problems at the end of the 80s and into the early 90s when Jim Crockett was bought out and the NWA became WCW, and Ric left not long after to jump to the WWF. And Ric's return to WCW and his last run in WWE.

As far as Discs 2 & 3, the match quality is excellent, but then again what would you expect with Ric Flair--a man who in his prime could go in the ring with a broom and deliver a 4 or 5 star classic. Some standouts for me; Flair and Kerry Von Erich, Flair and Sting, and of course, anytime Flair got in the ring with Steamboat.

Disc 3 also contains some of the best--and funniest--Flair promos of all-time; 2 of my favorites being ""What's Causing All This"" and ""Golden Spoon."" Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face.

Overall--if you're a fan of Slick Ric--then this is required viewing. 5 stars",1456531200,,1579,4.43448275862069

3159962,4,B0016MJ6LA,"Very good documentary that clocks in at over an hour and a half. Ric Flair himself spends a great deal of time in the documentary discussing about his life and career. To me he came across as frank and sincere, willing to expose his inner self for the world to see. The only thing about the documentary that I didn't like was the frequent appearance of HHH. I know they teamed up towards the end of Ric's career, but Hunter was a non factor for the majority of the Nature Boy's career(but of course I understand why HHH is there so much with the power that he holds).

The matches for the most part are pretty good(no match list will please everyone of course). But this is not the only DVD set out there for Ric Flair. Get his other sets for a more complete showcase of his wrestling career. And lastly the included promos were fun to watch. The Nature Boy is pure gold behind the mic. If you are a fan of Ric Flair or just a wrestling fan in general, there is no reason not to get this set as it is pretty cheap nowadays(just under six bucks on Amazon) and you get many hours great wrestling entertainment from one of the masters of this profession.",1421107200,,1151,4.255707762557078

3159998,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This was an awesome dvd. The documentary was great covering Flair's career from start to finish. He talks about his personal feuds with Jim Herd and Eric BIschoff. He covers his sections on rivalries with great wrestlers such as Ricky Steamboat, Sting, and HBK. After being buried in WCW he had a nice little run in WWE before he finally retired. The dvd features matches with Steamboat, HBK, HHH, Orten, Harley Race, Piper and Von Erich. They could have included more matches but the ones they did where pretty good and some rare. This is a great dvd for any true wrestling fan. It's great for new fans who want to learn about Flair and his full career. Ric Flair was the man and will always be the man. It's great to have dvds like this so fans can relive the great days when Flair was jet flying, limousine riding and you know the rest. In closing I have only one thing to say WOOOOOO!!!!

3160022,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I fell out of favor of the WWE since about 2004 or so when things started getting really predictable and stale, but came upon this documentary on Netflix earlier in the year and thought I'd give it a watch. I'm glad I did as it is a very comprehensive and detailed look into the life and career of one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time, and one of my personal favorites. I was very glad to sit down and take the time to get into this despite the fact that I haven't liked the WWE product in quite some time.

This documentary (and several others) took me back to the glory days of wrestling, when I was a kid/preteen totally into everything about the wrestling business, and made me pine for the good old days of professional wrestling. It made me hope the good old days would return sometime and I could get back into wrestling once again.",1388966400,,849,4.30625

3160029,5,B0016MJ6LA,"There is no one person who will ever be as great an all around professional wrestler as Ric Flair.  He sacrificed a lot (probably too much) to create his legacy.  The documentary showcases his rise to the top, and what he gave up along the way.  He seems to truly regret not being around for his kids when they were younger.  (And they certainly regret having their dad working just about every day of the year.)  But, he was clearly driven to greatness at any cost, and he achieved it.

3160045,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This release coming as a sequel to the ultra successful ""Ultimate"" collection does not or will not disappoint. If you love pro wrestling, if you love Ric Flair, you will find it essential to not only own this DVD, but also the ""Ultimate Flair Collection DVD"" itself.

I will rate everything on a 10 point scale. 1 being the lowest and 10 perfection.

Disc 1:

Documentary (10/10) - Flair really opens up and isn't afraid to pull any punches and tell it like it is. You really gain more respect of Ric Flair, while the Ultimate Collection was more about Flair's matches this documentary is more about Ric Flair the man. Toward the end of the documentary it becomes more of a tribute by fellow WWE superstars Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, HHH, HBK, Batista, and Randy Orton, but also you see an emotional Flair who really chokes up toward the end. This is a must watch.

Special Features w/Flair Tribute video (8/10) - nothing really earth shattering, but you get awesome 2 minutes vignettes of short stories that Flair tells you about his life. Also is the Flair Tribute video which is really nice put together. Nothing earth shattering but worth checking out.

Discs 2 & 3: Matches

Jack Brisco - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 8-18-1982 (8/10) - This was an impromptu bout but what you see is Flair wrestle more of a scientific bout and push his wrestling acumen. It is a really good bout has some down time in it but it is a solid match in this set.

Kerry Von Erich - World Class Championship Wrestling 8-24-1982 (10/10) - This is probably going to be the most under-rated bout on this set. Diehard fans know how great Kerry Von Erich is and Flair and Kerry put on a classic bout which is 2 of 3 falls title match. You will not be disappointed

Harley Race - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 8-31-1983 (9/10) - The precursor to Starcade 1983, the fued of Flair and Race heats up here for a classic title bout. You really start to see here Flair take over as a star and Race performs legendary as well

Ric Flair, Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez - World Wide Wrestling 12-15-1985 (10/10) - The match is solid, not great and not bad either but you get a Four Horseman bout in somewhat of a stable match. Flair had injured Dusty Rhodes and everyone rounds their men up.

Sting - Clash of the Champions I 3/27/1988 (10/10) - This is probably the signature bout on this DVD, if I could I would rate this bout 100. It is a personal favorite of mine and you will not be disappointed. It is 45 minutes of mayhem and J.J. Dillon is suspended above the ring!

Terry Funk - Great American Bash 7/23/1989 (9/10) - This is a great bout from two good rivals. You will not be disappointed!

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - Madison Square Garden 10/28/1991 (7/10) - This is a solid match between two great rivals. Piper who never looked up to anybody and Flair who looked down at everybody. It is a good brawl and is a match more so to remind of how good Roddy Piper can be against the elite!

Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat - Spring Stampede 4/17/1994 (8/10) - A Flair/Steamboat bout is as good as a match as any you can have, but it is disappointing that the WWE didn't put the Chi-Town Rumble bout on this match to complete the trilogy of legendary bouts between Flair and Steamboat. While I can rant over and over about why that match should be on here, this match is really the last great match by Steamboat and the two put on a classic bout here.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley - Taboo Tuesday 11/1/2005 (8/10) - You really learn how special Flair can be in this bout for the Intercontinetal title bout in a Steel Cage. In my eyes Flair puts out that last classic match and both get bloody you won't be disappointed.

Shawn Michaels - Wrestlemania XXIV 3/30/2008 (for the match (10/10) for the sentimental value 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/10) - The match that ended Ric Flair's career is a classic bout you knew Flair couldn't dodge any more bullets but he puts on a great show. You really can not measure how much Flair means to fans and fellow wrestlers. You can argue that you might rather have another match from the 1980's or 1990's from Flair but this match is great.

Disc 3: Special Features

Ric Flair's Farewell Address - I can not score it, it is immeasurable the emotion that night. I remember watching it that night and having a tear in my eye. To me it is not a farewell, but a celebration of excellence and only one man could have commanded that and that was Ric Flair!

Promos (100/10) - I am serious these are hilarious and great. This is what you call mic skills and if you are a wrestler today, or you want to be one, or you just want to learn to be cool watch these. Slick Ric is the the Limousine Riding, Jet Flying, Woman Stealing, Styling and Profiling!!!!!

Overview - While I almost thought is was impossible to top the Ultimate Flair collection, the WWE did. They put together another DVD set that you will not be disappointed in. This set is priceless",1248998400,15,5019,4.471553610503283
3160046,5,B0016MJ6LA,"Being a huge fan of Ric Flair, I wasn't sure about a second three disc compilation of some of his matches.

But the DVD collection was actually fantastic.  The matches were, naturally, top notch.  And despite a repeat from the first set of discs, it was great.  I highly recommend purchasing if you are a fan of Ric Flair.",1232928000,,322,4.406779661016949
3160047,5,B0016MJ6LA,"The first DVD has a lot of new interview time where Slick Rick talks about everything from the plane crash to retirement.  Stuff that wasn't in his previous 4 DVD set.  Some of the matches are the same and not much about the Horsemen as I would want.

Highly recommended!",1231632000,,271,4.38
3160048,2,B0016MJ6LA,"I've been a fan of the Nature Boy for quite some time.  This dvd came out to a lot of hype, but didn't live up to it.  It seems as though they just put a lot of the information in it that was told in the first Ric Flair dvd that was released, with the exception of his retirement. The song that they put to the story line was good, but it is grossly over used in the dvd.  It looks like it was rushed, which the WWE is becoming famous for, and poorly put together.  The matches they included are average at best, and definately not the definative collection.  Had I known what this dvd was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have wasted my money.  I watched it once and haven't looked at it since.",1231459200,,698,4.021739130434782

3160050,4,B0016MJ6LA,"While Ric Flair's first release in 2003 was indeed the Ultimate Collection as it stated to be. This Definitive Collection isn't quite definitive. But the documentary sure is & the reason why this gets a 4 stars. I was also pleased that they put Ric's Farewell Address from RAW in it's entirety. So I give props to WWE for that.

The first disc only holds the documentary along with  the Ric Flair tribute video & a couple of stories about Ric. Discs 2 and 3 are only matches with the third disc also having a couple of Ric Flair's promos from his NWA days & his Farewell Address on RAW (which is in it's entirety) the night after Wrestlemania. Lets get into disc one...

Lasting nearly 2 hours the documentary in my view really talks about the most important & interesting aspects throughout Ric Flair's career. You will hear from Ric himself & his family, legendary icons including Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Kevin Von Erich, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, former NWA owner David Crockett, Jack Brisco, JJ Dillon, Barry Windham, & others. It covers many of Flair's past from his beginnings in the AWA, Mid-Atlantic wrestling. And his near fatal plane crash Flair suffered very early in his career. Coming back & being the NWA World Champion, forming the Four Horsemen, his feuds with Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, & Sting. Having problems in WCW & coming to the WWE for a short period. More problems for Flair once going back to WCW. Returning to the WWE again & having epic matches with the likes of the Undertaker from Wrestlemania X8 & Triple H for the World Title from RAW in 2003. Forming Evolution with Triple H, Randy Orton, and Batista. And his final days in the business along with going into the Hall of Fame.

Disc 2
Mid-Atlantic Wrestling 8.18.82
Vs. Jack Brisco
This was during Flair's first run as NWA champion. Brisco was the former World champion. Not a match that was originally suppose to be here but one of those matches that Flair got himself into kind of deal. 4/5

World Class Championship Wrestling 8.24.82
2 out of 3 Falls Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Kerry Von Erich
This match was just a straight up war. Flair & Von Erich really fought the living day lights out of each other. If you're not familiar with the Von Erichs then this is a perfect match to see one in. A terrific match for the World Title. 5/5

Mid-Atlantic Wrestling 8.31.83
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Harley Race
At the time, this match was very rare because this match happened on television. And back then they rarely put World title matches on free TV. Race & Flair had far better matches together but this is a match that led to their epic Steel Cage match at Starrcade later that year. 4/5

World Wide Wrestling 12.15.85
w/ Arn Anderson & Ole Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez
Little surprised that this match was on here. It seemed like this is a match that they would've put on the Four Horsemen DVD. But it is a wild & crazy six man tag bout. I would've liked to have the Steel Cage match between Flair & Ricky Morton from the Four Horsemen DVD on here rather than this. But still a good match. 4/5

Clash of the Champions 3.27.88
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Sting
This is the match that put Sting on the map. The crowd was very into this one. Sting did an outstanding job in the ring against the Nature Boy. The only bad thing to say about this match is that since this being on TBS it only had a 45 minute time limit and not a 60 minute time limit. Phenomenal match though nevertheless. 5/5

Great American Bash 7.23.89
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Terry Funk
This match is unusual because its one of the first times that Flair is the face & not the heel. I liked this match very much but I personally like their I Quit match better. Flair gets very bloody here. The end was very sudden though, I must say that. The after math added some good value to it too with the Great Muta & Sting coming out and having a big postmatch brawl with Flair & Funk. 4.5/5

Disc 3
Madison Square Garden 10.28.91
Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper
I wasn't really all too fond with this match with Piper. It didn't suck but it just wasn't my cup of tea so a speak. But it is a rare match to see & a good one at that. 4/5

Spring Stampede 4.17.94
WCW Championship
Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat
While this match being a great one, it just wasn't the same as from their classics in 1989. But I do have to say either way, you will still get a great match up whenever The Nature Boy & The Dragon tie it up and this is no exception. You will still be pleased with this one. 4.75/5

Taboo Tuesday 11.1.05
Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Vs. Triple H
One of the greatest steel cage matches ever. This shows with Flair being north of 50 that Flair can still dish out & take a beating at the same time. In my opinion this is a classic match. A great match up right here. 5/5

Wrestlemania XXIV 3.30.08
Vs. Shawn Michaels
With this match happening 2 months before this release, it shouldn't have been on here. It is a great match but this could've been saved for another Flair classic from the 1980's. But with all do respect, a great match from two of the greatest performers of all time. 4.5/5

As I stated before this is not a Definitive Collection but I think most fans will be satisfied. It wasn't a waste of money & I'm glad I bought it. I also recommend the Ric Flair: Ultimate Collection set along with this DVD. I think the match selection could've been more thought out but overall I was pleased with the product. Very well worth it to me.",1229990400,,5617,4.430232558139535
3160051,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD set picks up where a previous set, The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, released in 2003, left off, and features extensive interviews with the 16-Time World Heavyweight Champion, as well as close friends and former rivals such as Triple H, Shawn Michaels, David Crockett, Cowboy Bob Orton, Randy Orton, Batista, Edge and Harley Race. There are several bonus features, such as the farewell address on Monday Night Raw on March 31st of this year, several promos, as well as extra stories from his family. Matches include opponents Ricky Steamboat, Sting, Kerry Von Erich, Harley Race, Triple H, Michaels, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Magnum T.A. The American Dream Dusty Rhodes, Manny Fernandez and Terry Funk. Owning all three of the DVD sets on the Nature Boy produced by WWE, you have a pretty complete record of Flair's career in all three sets. I highly recommend this one, most assuredly. Get this one for your wrestling DVD collection.",1229644800,,937,5.012820512820513
3160072,2,B0016MJ6LA,"Finally the DVD documentary that Flair fans have been waiting for! Well, not quite... The documentary part leaves areas uncovered and focuses more on the successes of Flair rather than exploring many controversies surrounding his career. Case in point:
-The reason why he didn't have a real program with Hulk in 1992
-His riot matches in Puerto Rico
-His opinion on Bret Hart
-The nWo Horsemen skit
-His 'feud' with Scott Steiner
-His fallout with Bischoff
-etc, etc
All those things are NOT properly covered in the DVD. Now the matches... Part entertaining, part laughing stock puts it best! A match with Jack Brisco in front of 30 people? Yes, they got that! Hahaha On disc 2, Ric wins one match out of 6! Ric Flair is the greatest just because he was the only one who would do jobs for anybody in a period when egos were overinflated! Ever heard: 'He could have made a broomstick look good'? Impossible! A Ric Flair match is 40% stalling and 55% selling... He couldn't amount any offense if his life depended on it! And I don't see him pretending to be hit by a broomstick! Oh well, I can actually (and he'll probably get color too)! Granted he's been in a lot of 60 min broadways that happened to include 15-20 minutes of wrestling spread throughout the stalling, but this is no Bret/Michaels 60-minute type match!

On the plus side, watch the Harley Race/Flair match on Disc 2 and try not to laugh... I defy you!

So 2 stars out of 5 for historical and camp value! Whoooo!",1222819200,,1477,4.548872180451128
3160073,5,B0016MJ6LA,Anything with the Nature Boy is a must buy.  This DVD set has some unseen matches and lives up to it's advertisement.  Definately worth the price.  You get your money's worth and more.,1222214400,,184,4.515151515151516
3160074,5,B0016MJ6LA,"If you're a fan of Ric Flair and his rich wrestling career then you must own this DVD, I know it may lack some matches as other people have said, but hey, the man had an enormous and long career, you can't get all his matches in one set, besides, and probably here's the thing, this DVD set complements the other one: Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen. I own both and I think I have the most complete collection of Ric Flair matches and bio one can have.

My suggestion is to get both because this DVD set concentrates on Ric Flair only with a little on the Four Horsemen, the matches it has are quite good and very good example of his career. I strongly recommend you get this if you're a serious wrestling fan.",1222128000,,708,4.1678832116788325
3160075,5,B0016MJ6LA,"A great guy and, entertainer. I haven't seen every Nature Boy moment so it was nice seeing all these stories from an amazing career. Slick Ric was my favorite part because, of how we know Ric can be with the expensive stuff. And after the story about his plane crash the guy was truly meant to be in this business. Now i want Natch to come back lol. This DVD is not a waste of time!",1220745600,,382,4.0394736842105265
3160076,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I am adding a comment to my review since Amazon has no link to address complaints.  Amazon has decided to sell an E-book that promotes child molestation and pedophilia.  I am now boycotting Amazon until they drop this item.  If you feel the same way about this, I encourage you to boycott Amazon as well.

This is the one.  This set is worth the money for one match alone- the infamous showdown with Sting.  The rest is all frosting (pink frosting at that) on the proverbial cake.  It also covers Ric's struggle to break into wrestling, his influences, and quite a few hilarious interviews.  Also shows highlights from the big WWE tribute.

Highly recommended to wrestling fans in general.",1220054400,,689,4.722689075630252
3160077,3,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD's documnetary is good. However, most of the main topics in the documentary were already included in the Ultimate Flair and Horsemen DVDs. It was interesting to listen to Flair's opinions of Ole Anderson, Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Bischoff. The matches from the 1980's were good to include. However, WWE should have also includeed Flair vs. Vader(Clash Nov.'93 and Starrcade '93). Those two matches were extremely well worked. Steamboat vs. Flair from Spring Stampede'94 was a decent choice, but they may have been better off including his world title win against Savage from Sept.'92 instead. Furthermore, they could have included Flair and Arn Anderson vs. Hollywood Blondes from the Clash of Champs(June'93). Flair vs. Hogan from Uncensored'99 and a Nitro from Jan.or Feb. 96 would have also been intersting. Flair's retirement match was awesome, but the match is too recent to include in this collection compared to other classics ""Naitch"" has had in the '80s and '90s. It would have been better to include HBK from his Rocker days vs. Flair from late '91.
Overall, this DVD was good. However, this DVD should have been great. After all, Flair only deserves the best. This DVD has great promos. The Space Mountainettes promo is awesome. Flair's promos truly made him unique. ""Lookin' only as I can look. What's causin' all of this? Diamonds are forever and so is Ric Flair/Four Horsemen.""",1219881600,,1397,5.0519480519480515
3160078,3,B0016MJ6LA,"Its mainly commentary from HHH and HBK (go figure) pretty much talking about Flair's entire career, which is fine, but what really bugs me is there are very few interviews or less interview time with alot of the old timers in the business who wrestled Flair back in his glory days. Arn Anderson must have had 5 minutes of interview time THE ENTIRE DVD and he was Flair's best friend for so many years. Harley Race had a few minutes,Dusty had 2-3 mins, Tully had 2-3 mins, Terry Funk had NONE, Steamboat had a few minutes. JJ Dillon very few minutes etc.

Anyway, the earlier parts of Ric's career are talked about as they even show a clip of him winning his FIRST NWA World Title. Orton and Batista make brief appearances late in the DVD when Flair talks about Evolution. Ric's first WWE run in the early 90s was barely touched on and no reason was given to even why he left. Also, no reason given as to why they didn't book Flair Vs. Hogan at Wrestlemania 8. Alot of Flair's early career is covered though. I didn't know he was adopted. Talked about how he trained with Ken Patera and how they both started in AWA with Vern Gagne. They briefly skimmed the Four Horsemen era, but that's because of the Four Horsemen DVD. Really the only part of Flair's career that is really touched on in depth is his early career in the early 70s to 80s. Also, the plane crash Flair was in with a couple of other wrestler including Johhny Valentine (Greg's father.) Most of Flair's late career was just glossed over very quickly (even his late wcw days) which was very disappointing. All in all it was a good DVD, but it could have been better IMO. I enjoyed Jake Robert's, ECW, Pillman's, Piper's, Hart's DVDs much more.

P.S.: I'm just glad Sting Vs. Flair from Clash of The Champions was finally released on DVD, its a timeless classic. Also, Michaels Vs. Flair from Wrestlemania 24 is a MUST watch! There have been very few 5 star matches in wrestling history and this is one of them!",1218672000,3,1973,4.432506887052342
3160079,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD is absolutely amazing! :D
Its for any ric flair fan out there, or better yet, Its for any Wrestling fan out there, because as we all know, Ric Flair is the Greatest wrestler of all time.
Woo!! 5 star DVD.",1218067200,,213,4.095238095238095
3160080,4,B0016MJ6LA,"It's hard to condense Ric Flair's pro wrestling career, even on 3 full DVD's.  WWE already did a 3 DVD set hosted by Flair in 2003 (The Ultimate Collection Set).  This complation basically picks up where that one left off with more interviews and behind the scenes footage and fewer matches.

Here you get a two hour long biography where Flair takes you threw his career, from his earliest days in the AWA to the ""Win Or Retire"" angle that played out until this past March at WrestleMania 24.  A veritable who's who of wrestling, from Nick Bockwinkle to HHH add comentary at different points.  Flair is definately honest, and not always nice, although much of what he says has already been printed in multiple books, etc.  Not a lot of new ground, just Flair in his words better explaining a lot of ""old ground"", along with plenty of match highlights and promo interviews from his heyday on TBS Saturday Night Wrestling show.

There are extras such as ""Flair's Final Weekend"" as WWE cameras follow the Nature Boy around Orlando during the WrestleMania Weekend (which included Flair's induction into the Hall Of Fame), and Flair receiving a key to the city in for his charitable work one week prior to his final match.  The complete tribute to Flair from the post-WrestleMania Monday Night Raw TV broadcast is shown, including footage not seen on live TV including Vince McMahon and The Undertaker, among others.

Match wise you get an eclectic mix of famous matches not included in the first set from 5 yrs ago (Sting from The Clash Of Champions TV Special, March 1988 and vs Terry Funk from the 1989 Great American Bash PPV) as well as never before released classics like his impromptu battle with fellow Hall Of Famer Jack Brisco on Mid Atlantic Wrestling TV in 1982 (an exceptionally good match for free TV) and a never before televised battle with ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper from Madison Square Garden in 1991 after Flair first arrived in the WWE.

None of the matches are bad, in fact every one is 4or 5 star quality. Some famouse Flair matches were left off.  Flair's TLC (Tables, Ladders, and Chairs) Match vs Edge from Jan 2006 and his ""I Quit"" Match vs Mick Foley from SummerSlam 2006 are obvious missed from his later years, although both have been issued on other DVD releases. There is a rumored ""Best Of Starrcade"" set supposedly in the works by WWE which may explain why such matches as vs Lex Luger (Starrcade 88, arguably Luger's best ever Main Event Match) and his win or retire match vs Vader (Starrcade 93)were excluded.

Personally, I would like to have seen a Flair/Piper match from their wild early 80's days, although the one here from Flair's first WWE run is pretty good.  Likewise I personally think the last ever televised Flair vs Steamboat Match from May 1994 which ended their feud is better than the April, 1994 Pay Per View bout included here but this is an excellent match.

Combined with the first ""Ultimate Collection"" you get a pretty good overview of the most decorated career in pro wrestling.  On it's own it's better than average, a B plus.  Fact is, Flair's career had so many terrific moments it is hard to condense them, even in a 3 disc set. You definately will be entertained, and the less well known matches are true keepers.  The biography portion is at times moving, and the emotional final tribute from RAW is an absolute collectors must have, easily the single biggest send off anyone in pro wrestling ever got, hands down. If you are a Flair fan you will really enjoy this set, if you are a pro wrestling fan, especially from the last 25 yrs, this set will not leave you disappointed.  Is there more material that could have been added, yes, but this set is still worth the investment.  Plus, if WWE does finish the ""Best Of Starrcade"" set than many of the matches fans have lamented missing here will be on DVD.",1216252800,10,3856,4.627565982404692
3160081,5,B0016MJ6LA,This was a very well made dvd to me. A great story of Ric Flair's career. This dvd was not intended to give us a bunch of matches it is basically a tribute to the career of Ric Flair. This dvd does have some good matches however as said it is not many. They have the ultimate Ric flair dvd that has tons of matches on it this is not that dvd I would call this dvd more of a companion to the Ultimate Ric Flair dvd. If you want the story of Flair's career to go along with the other dvd set I defintely reccomend this dvd. I did not buy this dvd for matches I bought because of the documentary of Ric Flair. If you want to buy a dvd with lots of matches then you want the Ultimate Ric flair. To me you would be missing out by not picking up this dvd as well.,1215993600,,757,3.7974683544303796
3160082,5,B0016MJ6LA,"Just picked up the new Flair DVD. The doc on Disc 1 is amazing along with the stories and tribute video. As for Discs 2 and 3, I want to try to squash a notion I've seen in these reviews.

People are complaining about the matches used for the DVD. The Sting and Funk matches aren't on any other DVD. The Michaels match is mandatory and you know they are going to put a Triple H match on there. The other Steamboat stuff is already on DVD. My only complaint about the DVD is I think they skimped him on the promos a bit for Disc 3 a bit.

This guy essentially has 8 discs devoted to his career which is unheard of and amazing. He's the man. Enjoy what you have folks!",1215907200,,666,4.0
3160083,4,B0016MJ6LA,"I just bought this release yesterday and let me say that it gets four stars because of the documentary, the stories section, tribute video and for showing the RAW tribute segment in its entirety! Now, let's break this one down:

Disc 1 features a near 2 hour documentary on Ric Flair with comments from former NWA announcer David Crockett, Harley Race, Kevin Von Erich, Dusty Rhodes, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, Arn Anderson, JJ Dillon and others. It covers his beginnings from his early life, the AWA, the Mid-Atlantic area (including that near fatal plane crash), his days at NWA champion, The Four Horsemen, his feuds with Dusty Rhodes, Rick Steamboat and Sting, his time in WWF/WWE, his problems in WCW, his WWE return (including Evolution, his Wrestlemania X-8 bout with The Undertaker and his final days as a wrestler).

Disc 1 also features some short stories from the man himself and a tribute video to Flair.

Disc 2 and 3 are just matches and promos. Let's go into Disc 2 for a bit:

Vs. Jack Brisco - Flair was in his first run as NWA champion as he took on former NWA champion Jack Brisco in a mostly scientific match. This wasn't for the title by the way, it was more of an impromptu match.

Vs. Kerry Von Erich (NWA World Title match/2 out of 3 falls) - If all you know of Kerry Von Erich is the ""Texas Tornado"" or just a member of the tragic Von Erich family, you really need to see this! I personally think he was better here than the day he won the title from Flair in 1984! This one felt like a war! This match also led to the infamous cage match that began the epic Von Erich/Freebird story.

Vs. Harley Race (NWA World Title Match) - This was notable because it happened on television and it was rare for a title match to be on TV. It gives you a glimpse of what was to come at Starrcade '83 later that year.

Ric Flair, Ole & Arn Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. & Manny ""Ragin' Bull"" Fernandez - This was a wild six man tag that came on the heels of Dusty's injury at the hands of Flair and the Andersons. My problem with this one isn't the match itself, its great! It is because this entry was more appropriate for the Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen release than this set. I kind of felt the same way about Ric Flair's bout with Ricky Morton on the aforementioned set. That bout would've been a great entry on this one.

Vs. Sting (Clash Of The Champions) - I originally stated that this match was overused. That was an error on my part as I thought this bout was on Ultimate Ric Flair when in fact it was another Sting/Flair encounter. As for this match, I won't knock much because this match proved why Flair is a legend and this match made Sting a legend in his own right.

Vs. Terry Funk (The Great American Bash) - I personally like this bout better than their more famous ""I Quit"" match that took place later that year in 1989. The Flair neck injury angle added drama to the match up. I haven't looked at WWE's version of this match but I do know that afterwards was one of the wildest post match brawl I've ever seen with both Sting and Japanese star The Great Muta getting involved with Flair and Funk!

Disc 3

Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - I will say that I wished they would've put one of Piper Vs. Flair matches from the Mid-Atlantic area on here. Still, its a rare match and it is pretty good. Nothing on the level of Flair/Steamboat or Flair/Sting but it doesn't suck either.

Vs. Ricky Steamboat (WCW World Title Match) - While a great matchup from 1994, it falls short of their classics in 1989. Still, when these two got together, you are hard pressed to find a bad match between ""The Nature Boy"" and ""The Dragon.""

Vs. HHH (Taboo Tuesday 2005) - One of the best cage matches ever! While I do think this could've been left off for another Flair classic from the 1980's, the match itself is great!

Vs. Shawn Michaels (WrestleMania 24) - Another that could've been left off since this WM is now available. But the match itself is a classic so I have nothing bad to say about the match in itself.

This disc also has the Flair Farewell Address along with some promos from his NWA days.

Overall, it isn't a total waste of money in my view but it could've been better. Interesting to note that when discussing the Greenville reunion of the Horsemen, they actually show Chris Benoit (though he isn't mentioned directly). While my opinion of the man is low, I am glad WWE didn't alter the footage just to please people.

Anyway, WWE's latest release falls short on the matches but makes up for it with the documentary and the promos and, of course, the farewell address. On this one, you will have to decide if its worth the price. For myself, I was mostly pleased though I agree that the selections of matches could've been better or at least another disc which I would've gladly paid more money for.",1215820800,46,4841,4.379041248606466
3160084,2,B0016MJ6LA,"Of the millions of classic matches that Flair had, why were we treated to the ones we saw, like the forever showed Clash 1 with him and Sting.....that was on volume 1. Where was the Starrcade 84 vs. Dusty Rhosed, Starrcade 86 vs. Nikita, July 11 1987 match against Jimmy Garvin? I only watched the Terry Funk match so far. I do have another complaint, but not about the DVD, but about Flair himself in the documentary. He was talking way too low, and at times, I had to turn the volume up to hear what he was saying. He was almost mumbling. Vince, this is another DVD that you didn't put together right.",1215820800,,603,4.298245614035087

What makes this great is that it's a documentary as well as a classic lineup of bonus features that include the best matches ever and some great segments.  His Raw send off was my favorite Raw moment.  Before this DVD, I was reliant on YouTube for the Undertaker and Vince coming out and hugging Ric, so this DVD does justice to that day that bookended Ric's career.  Beyond that, this DVD gives some great insight (more) into what really was happening with WCW.  Get this DVD if you have even the smallest interest in professional wrestling.  The Naitch has done it all and is chronicled in this larger than life DVD!",1215561600,,649,4.4576271186440675

3160087,3,B0016MJ6LA,"This dvd set could be much better. They should have focused more on his wrestling matches than documentaries. I mean his last dvd already covered the plane crash for instance. Some day I'd love a dvd set that has all 16 World title wins. I was hoping this would be that set but they have just been releasing too small of sets of late. Plus this is Ric Flair, who cares if you have to pay $30 to $60 for a dvd set worthy of his career. Because this cheap set sure isn't worthy to it. It's nice that it does have 3 rare matches at least but he deserves more. Especially if this is the last time they release a Flair dvd set.

  What I actually want to see is Flair vs Steamboat in early matches before the World title feuds. Flair vs Sting where Flair won the title back in the early 90's has never been on dvd. Flair as the Black Scorpion vs Sting was a classic as well since Flair did moves he has never done so you wouldn't know it was him.

3160088,1,B0016MJ6LA,"This is ridiculous.  The fact that the WWE owns many of the matches from Flair's days in the Mid-Atlantic and his traveling days as the NWA Champ to the territory's such as Florida (CWF), World Class, Georgia, and Mid-South is no excuse to put together a sloppy compilation as this.

Here is what should be on the DVD in my opinion:

Flair becoming the Nature Boy after starting off his career weighing well over 300 pounds and looking anything like the Naitch!

His first few years in the Mid-Atlantic and his feud with Wahoo McDaniel.

His partnerships with Greg Valentine and Blackjack Mulligan.  Winning the NWA World Tag Team title with each and then having subsequent fall outs and brutal wars with both men over the US title.  The hat and robe incident with Mulligan that lead to Flair and Valentine having brutal matches with Mulligan.  The angel where Flair now a babyface asked Valentine to be his partner against Jimmy Snuka and the Iron Sheik, only to have Valentine turn on him and legitimately break Flair's nose with Gene Anderson cane.

His early wars with Rick Steamboat and the infamous ""ugly face"" angel.  Many of thoe matches were classic 30-60 minute draws.

His wars with Jimmy Snuka over the US title and the belt changing hands.

His first shot at the NWA World Title against Harley Race back in 78/79. A sign of things to come.

Champion vs Champion match against Bob Backlund in the Omni from 7/82

The Von Erichs- Flair had classic matches against David, Kerry, and Kevin, including the Steel Cage match vrs Kerry that lead to their famous fued with The Freebirds.

Flair's fued with Roddy Piper and their classic interviews over the US Belt. First with Flair as the babyface and later Piper.

His matches in Florida against a young Barry Windam, Dusty Rhodes from the 84 orange bowl ""Champions of Champions"" or as the Midnight Rider, Matches vs other Florida greats such as Lex Lugar.

Flair rekindles his fued with Wahoo McDaniel only this time McDaniel is the heel and teams with Tully Blanchard while Flair teams with Dusty Rhodes.

More Ricky Steamboat matches from 83/84 when Steamboat comes out of retirement and their match at the Meadowlands in NJ 1984.

I want to hear from the mans mouth about the other title changes and his life on the Road.

Im just saying with all the choices to put on the DVD this is what they came up with?  In the words of the late Gorilla Moonson, GIMME A BREAK!  Vince always talks about giving 110% but this is just not it!",1214697600,11,2489,4.621867881548975
3160089,5,B0016MJ6LA,"Ric is the ultimate showman on camera and inside the ring, and the ultimate gentlemen outside.  I would love to see a 500 disc set featuring every match the man ever had but being realistic this is a great set.  The Flair/Sting Clash of Champions match and Kerry Von Erich 2 out of 3 falls is worth the price alone.

WWE is at their best when making these types of sets and I expect nothing less than a phenomenal offering.

I can't wait to sit down once again and re-live my youth with the greatest to ever lace up his boots.

I just wish I had some reason to watch WWE programming today.  Too bad it is such crap.",1214265600,,615,4.126050420168068

Never the less it looks like it should be a good investment!",1213315200,,325,4.015384615384615

3160103,1,B0016MJ6LA,"looking through the other reviews on this, please tell me I am missing something. With a man that had such a great career with many great matches those are the only matches we get?

if this was his first dvd I may have given it two stars but most of the backstory of flair can be found on the 1st DVD in some fashion.

Such a great career and these are the matches WWE wants him remembered for, sad.",1212796800,,399,4.037974683544304
3160104,1,B0016MJ6LA,"There is NO reason why this dvd does NOT include the match with Savage from WM8.  I have absolutely no idea why WWE chose to leave that match off of here.

3160105,1,B0016MJ6LA,"I was very dissappointed to read the match selection for the DVD.

Not only are one on one classics like Flair vs Luger, Magnum TA, Koloff, Vader and Savage are missing but they have taken 5 of the opponents from the first Flair set and put in matches against them on this set.

The Flair vs Steamboat 94 is not their best confrontation, as the CHi Town Rumble from 89 and their mid atlantic battles are considered superior. Same can be said of Flair vs Piper as their MSG match was not their best match.

Opponents from the first set take 50% of the matches (including Mr. Backstage Politics HHH). The one true gem is the match against Kerry Von Erich.

The 6 man tag is the only match I have never seen (or do not remember) but having Magnum on the DVD can only be a plus.",1210550400,5,774,4.20945945945946
3160106,5,B0016MJ6LA,"The Ultimate Collection went into Flair's famous feuds, The 4 Horsemen went into the history of the legendary group, but now...we get the story on the man himself in Ric Flair.

The documentary begins with Flair being a ""black market baby"" & growing up playing football before going into how he met Verne Gagne through Ken Patera & eventually go into the NWA though Wahoo McDaniels.  The story behind the plane crash that forever effected his life was gone into before the story of how he became ""The Nature Boy"" was heavily discussed & the importance of his United States Championship run.  Flair's first NWA Championship run, all the politics surrounding it, the responsibility of behind the WORLD champion, and how it effected his family was heavily discussed here before going into the buildup for Starrcade & how his second NWA Title reign was different from the first one.  Flair's ""stylin' & profilin'"" image & lifestyle along with stories behind his memorable catchphrases is talked about next before going into a brief story behind the formation of the Horsemen & their feud with Dusty Rhodes.  Flair's classic matches with Sting, Ricky Steamboat, and Terry Funk are talked about next before all the problems Jim Crockett Promotions encountered leading to Turner buying the company & Flair eventually leaving.  Flair's run as the ""Real World's Champion"" is discussed along with why the feud with Hogan didn't really happen before Flair's return to WCW & how there was problems from day one is also touched upon.  Flair's involvement with Hogan & Savage coming to WCW, the misuse of his character, and problems regarding Eric Bischoff was discussed next followed by Flair reflecting on the last Nitro & WCW going out of business.  Flair's return to the WWE & all the confidence issues he had for months were dove into before talking about his importance in the group of Evolution with Orton & Batista giving their favorite Flair moments before briefly talking about his feud with Mick Foley.  The documentary wraps up with comments about Flair's WrestleMania weekend by going into the Hall Of Fame, his match with Shawn Michaels, and his farewell on RAW.

DVD Extras spread across all the disc are bonus stories regarding Superstar Billy Graham helping Flair bleach his hair, tales of hanging out with Dusty Rhodes & Dick Murdock, how Flair buying wrestling boots foreshadowed his future ""Nature Boy"" lifestyle, Flair's current wife talking about his relationship with Shawn Michaels & Evolution members Triple H & Batista, and two hidden stories about Flair hitchhiking from Minnesota to Florida & a story regarding the plane crash.  Along with the bonus stories come 9 Flair promos (1 was a hidden extra on Flair's first DVD), the tribute music video, highlights of Flair receiving a key to the city of Columbia, SC, and the farewell on RAW with bonus footage of what happened off the air with Undertaker & Vince McMahon making their appearances.

Matches include:
vs. Jack Brisco - This was during Flair's first run as NWA Champion & nothing more past a short encounter that showcased some good old school wrestling & great storytelling by both men.
""Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '82

2 Out Of 3 Falls vs. Kerry Von Erich - This match is very much like a lot of the matches on this disc in that it's a ""lost classic"" that gets overshadowed by their more popular encounters.  While everyone remembers their cage match & the match were Kerry won the title, this was better than both of them.  They went hard for 45 mins. with the first fall not even happening until half way into the match...this was a wrestling war.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '82

vs. NWA Champion Harley Race - This was more of a preview for the upcoming cage match at Starrcade as they went back & forth here in a good wrestling encounter that gets overshadowed by the ending of Bob Orton & Dick Slater collecting the bounty for injuring Flair.  As a side note, you can see why they call Harley one of the toughest men in wrestling as he just kept using head butts throughout the match to hurt Flair knowing those got to hurt himself.
(The conclusion of his match can be seen on Ultimate Ric Flair Collection)
""Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '83

w/Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A., Manny Fernandez - This match didn't last long (around 10 mins.) but from bell to bell between all 6 men, this was a fun match to watch. It wasn't a classic wrestling match by any means but just each man doing what they do best as far as being entertaining & being able to hold the hot crowd in the psalms of their hands.
""World Wide Wrestling"" Dec. '85

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Sting - This was the match that made Sting a household name overnight. James J. Dillion was suspended over the ring in the cage to prevent interference in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today. They went to a time limit draw & had a split decision with judges (which defeats the purpose of the judges in the first place but whatever). When Flair said on the Horsemen DVD that ""we made a career making guys..."", this was the best example possible that fits that statement.
(The conclusion of this match can be seen on the Ultimate Ric Flair collection)
Clash of the Champions I

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Terry Funk - This match gets heavily overshadowed by their ""I Quit"" match later in the year or even by the infamous Thunderdome Cage Match with Sting & Muta at Halloween Havoc the month before that but this match was the one that kicked the whole feud off after Funk attacked Flair at WrestleWar. Just classic Funk in that the match was wild with them beginning the fight on the floor for keeping it on the outside for various parts of the bout. The rest of the match was Flair & Funk one upping each other by focusing on each other's necks & even using the branding iron against each other at one point or another. I consider this a lost classic & a different type of match than what you would see from Flair before this feud.  And keep watching afterwards as they show one of the wildest post-match brawls in wrestling.
Great American Bash '89

vs Roddy Piper - Flair's MSG debut for this WWE run (his original MSG debut is on the ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"").  I made the note on Piper's set that he was missing a Flair match so I'm glad a match from their feud is here.  While this wasn't a great wrestling match, it was very entertaining as Flair tried to play Piper's game of brawling along with both men pulling off their comedic spots just made you chuckle a time or two.
""MSG"" Dec. '91

vs. Ricky Steamboat - They meet in same city that started their famous trilogy 5 years earlier. The match was a nice back & forth encounter between the two that features various ""deja vu"" moments.  However, Steamboat & Flair had 5 years worth of hype & a legacy of their previous trilogy to live up to which they couldn't top in this match.
Spring Stampede '94

Steel Cage Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship vs. Triple H - Without a doubt, match of the night for this PPV & one of the best matches of this year that's heavily forgotten about. Both guys bleed hard (Flair gets busted over in the opening minutes) with Triple H being just vicious & even using a steel chain while on Flair just never gave up & kept fighting back. Great match with the bonus of Joey Styles doing his old fashioned style of commentary which added to the storytelling of the match...even to the point where Joey pointed out at the beginning just how important the Intercontinental Championship meant in this match.
Taboo Tuesday '05

Career Threatening Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Shawn gave Ric the best match he's had since the 2005 series of matches with Triple H. This match was an emotional rollercoaster as you saw Ric Flair pulling out some of his old ""dirtiest player in the game"" tricks on HBK throughout the match while HBK was conflicted with ""putting 'Old Yeller' out of his misery"" & even held back from taking Flair out with sweet chin music early in the match. During one point, HBK returned Flair's slap from RAW & drew ""first blood"" on Flair by making his mouth bleed while later, Flair looked like he was fighting for his life in HBK's figure four & even ripped off the bottom turnbuckle post in the process of trying to get out of it. However, Flair's career was ended with the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"" & the third sweet chin music. This was the type of performance that Ric Flair needed to end his career on...and he got it.
WrestleMania 24

In the end, the documentary covered what wasn't already covered in Flair's previous sets without repeating the a lot of the information & heard from people that we don't normally hear from like David Crockett, Jack Brisco, and Harley Race.  As for the matches, people are going to have varied opinions about this set since Flair had over 30 years of matches to choose from but I felt that all the matches showcased things that either weren't acknowledged in his previous sets like feuds (Von Erich & Piper) or time periods in his career (first NWA title run, WCW run, last WWE run), lost classic matches (Sting), or Flair wrestling different types of styles that were rarely seen from him (Terry Funk). So in the end, I'm still saying this is a 5 star release from WWE that I highly recommend.",1210550400,9,9432,4.644057623049219

3160108,5,B0016MJ6LA,"OK, I just watched the documentary and it is EXCELLENT! The 1st hour is Fantastic! However, it drops off after Flair Comes back to WCW in 1993. Basically Ric says that WCW SUCKED from 1993-2001 and he was glad it was shutdown. I find that hard to believe. His fued with Savage was awesome and that was not even touched on. His 1999 championship is also not touched on. The documentary does pick back up after Ric Returned to WWE in 2001. The last WWE years are covered pretty good(as one would expect!).

Of course everyone is screaming there is not enough matches. I agree. I really wanted to see more Mid-Atlantic stuff with Greg Valentine. His US Title matches from the late 70s etc etc..

All and all I am VERY pleased with the set. However, I have basically every Importnat Ric Flair Match from 1985 Up. Just would be nice to have the all in DVD quality..lol

Ric Flair Tribute Video

Disc 2

Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling 08/18/82: Jack Brisco Vs. Ric Flair - A nice number of derogatory comments from Flair to start off this event. Flair plays the traditional heel here being scared of the face, but still taking it to him when he could get the advantage. Kind of a short match, but very good on the technical scale. Still very funny seeing Flair tried coming off the top rope even way back then.

World Class Championship Wrestling 08/24/82: 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship: Kerry Von Erich Vs. Ric Flair - This was long before the late Von Erich had become WWE's ""Texas Tornado."" This match went over forty minutes and is a huge slugfest between two men that couldn't stand one another. Flair became a bloody mess as he usually does and it ended in a gigantic pull apart brawl. Some really good moves and techniques were used by both men, but they were more focused on just beating down each other. Fun match.

Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling 08/31/83: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Ric Flair Vs. Harley Race - Oddly enough Flair was the face here while the crowd really gave it to Race. I've never seen too many Harley Race matches, but I can see what the big deal was. He was a great heel and really showed it in the ring with his mannerisms and sheer brutality. These guys beat the hell out of one another for close to thirty minutes and I'm amazed they could keep going on. A screwjob finish full of interference doesn't take away from how good the match was throughout, but it would have been nice to see it end cleanly.

World Wide Wrestling 12/15/85: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, & Ole Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez - Flair was the champion at the time and the Andersons were tag champs. These were some heated rivalries back then and the crowd was going nuts during this match. Dusty had an injured leg and was doing all he could just to stand up at times, but the heels made it a point to show how dirty they truly were. Rhodes and TA were known as ""America's Team"" so taking it to them really got the heel heat going for Flair, Arn, and Ole. Not a bad tag match though that ended up turning into a huge brawl near the end.

Clash Of The Champions 03/27/88: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Sting Vs. Ric Flair - Flair's (the Four Horsemen's) manager JJ Dillon was locked in a cage for this match and raised high above the ring. Sting had the blonde flattop and bright face paint which made him insanely over with the crowd. This was a big-time feud from back in the day which I recall seeing numerous times on different Clash Of The Champions events. At the beginning of the match, the announcers beat home the fact that there is a television time limit for this bout. Needless to say it went the distance and went to the judges' score cards. For the three-judge panel, one was in favor of Sting, another for Flair, and the last called the contest a draw. Flair remains champion, but this was the match that made Sting. Totally in his element.

Great American Bash 07/23/89: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Ric Flair Vs. Terry Funk - Flair makes his way to the ring with four beauties in long silver dresses. This was before Funk's body was broken and totally in shambles and...hey, is that Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts as one of the ringside security? Weird because I really think it was.

Another good match here as Flair used every bit of technical expertise he knew and really laid into Funk. But Funk is a brawler and, according to what I hear from the announcers here, Flair had a bit of a neck problem. They built it up the entire match that one piledriver from Funk could probably end Flair's career. Funk brought the brutality and kept working on the neck hoping to wear down the champion. Things started breaking down though as Gary Hart interfered on Funk's behalf as did the Great Muta. And an unlikely ally in Flair's former enemy Sting came to his aide.

Disc 3

Madison Square Garden 10/28/91: Ric Flair Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - I remember this feud and it honestly seemed as if they both hated each other's guts. Piper never really had a style because he could be technical one second and then brawl with you the next. There is also a fun bit of humor from Piper included in this match. If you're looking for a match including two of the dirtiest players in the game though, this is it. There is some good brawling and a bunch of behind the ref's back tactics here making this not the most technical match ever, but a fun one.

Spring Stampede 04/17/94: WCW Championship: Ric Flair Vs. Ricky Steamboat - These two had some of the best matches in the history of wrestling and this is no exception. It amazes me just how great these two complimented each other. Never did they have to try and pick up the pace or their own game so that they could make the other look good; they did it on their own. And having Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan calling a Flair match is the icing on the cake because he had this freakish love affair with the Nature Boy that was hilarious. A good number of restholds slow this match down at times, but the near falls and close calls keep the tension mounting.

The ending of this match was a double-pin which wasn't the type of clean ending one would hope for from a great match like this. Flair retained at the time and the double pin didn't ruin it, but later forced the title to be vacated at the time.

Taboo Tuesday 11/01/05: Steel Cage Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship: Triple H Vs. Ric Flair - Future good friends Triple H and Ric Flair would battle it out over Flair's Intercontinental Title in a match decided on by the fans. It was between a steel cage, a regular match, or a submission match. Steel cage won out by a large margin and paved the way for a bloody battle between two of the greatest.

The match went back and forth a lot in the beginning, but then they would eventually exchange control. Triple H went to great lengths breaking out a steel chain and even getting a chair in hopes of beating the Nature Boy. Flair was busted open and had that bloodied hair look early on so it is a wonder how the man loses so much blood and can always continue. Overall this wasn't perhaps one of the matches I would have chosen to be in this set, but it's still a good match nonetheless.

WrestleMania XXIV 03/30/08: Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair Vs. Shawn Michaels - For months Ric Flair had been fighting for his wrestling life. Vince McMahon told Flair that he didn't have to retire as long as he could keep winning, so every match was a possible career ending match. No matter what was thrown at him, Flair still somehow was able to show that the ""dirtiest player in the game"" was not going down without a fight. For thirty-five years he had been the ultimate name in both sports entertainment and wrestling while fans both new and old respected and loved him. This night would be one of his greatest matches and also his last.

Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels are two favorites that have been around for a very long time. Not only have they made themselves look good, but they also make every single person they step into the ring with look good. This match would just go to prove that they deserve every piece of recognition, all the compliments, and each of the accomplishments they have achieved in their careers. This match portrayed them as the awesome competitors they are and they just put on an absolute masterpiece. Flair gave it everything he had, but in the end it was just too much. The Heartbreak Kid wasn't too happy about it, but he is the one that retired the Nature Boy. It was truly a classic moment as Michaels mouthed ""I'm sorry. I love you!"" to Flair before delivering the final blow. No wrestling fan should go without seeing this match.

Extras
Ric Flair's Farewell Address: Raw 03/31/08 - If you haven't already seen this, then I don't know how you can call yourself a wrestling fan. This is from Raw the night after Flair's last match at WrestleMania XXIV, and it is simply fantastic. I believe it lasted about twenty minutes when it first aired and had Flair's farewell speech, Triple H's speech, all his friends and family coming to the ring, and then the entire WWE roster coming out. At about the twenty minute mark is when the WWE exclusive footage kicks in if what happened after Raw went off the air and it needs to be seen to be believed and appreciated.

I hope they put in some 90's WCW Nitro stuff and WWF/E stuff.  I don't think they should put the Hall of Fame induction unless they add the tribute to him on Raw W/Undertaker & McMahon.  If they put the HOF and not the Trib.  i think it's a waist to have the WM 24 DVD and the new Ric Flair DVD

3160110,3,B0016MJ6LA,"Some things that I am hoping for:

1.) PLEASE have both a standard DVD release of this title as well as a HD (Blu Ray) version. I see that the WWE is going to be offering a Blu Ray disc version of WrestleMania this year and so I REALLY, REALLY wish they would go to the trouble of making this available in Blu Ray as well.

2.) Whether or not it's in Blu Ray and whether or not this is included in their WrestleMania DVD package this year - this DVD absolutely needs to have the following:
The match between Flair and Michaels from WrestleMania 2008, his 2008 WWE HOF induction, and the final 25 minutes of RAW where they had the Flair Tribute (and this NEEDS to have the footage of the Undertaker and Vince McMahon that was not televised on USA).

3. The earlier poster was correct about needing the Sting Vs. Flair match up from Baltimore when Sting won his first NWA/WCW World title. He was also making a good suggestion for requesting the Lex Luger/Ric Flair match from WrestleWar 1990. I would like to see the Ric Flair and Arn Anderson Vs. Doom match from the 1990 Halloween Havoc and some of the promos that Ric did for that Horsemen/Doom feud.

4. It also always seems to me that some of Flair's best promos from his WCW days are omitted from the WWE DVD sets. It's like they almost want to ignore 1989-1992 when it comes to his promo's and matches in WCW.
Which is a shame because there were some great ones.
I would like an hour or more of nothing but his promos and interviews from 1988-1994.

5. I also remember a few sets of promos Flair did with Shawn Michaels back in 2003 or 2004 that were REALLY good. I wish those series of promos and interviews would be included as well as all of the interviews and promos leading with Shawn leading up to this years WM match up.",1209081600,2,1782,4.275964391691395

Some matches are Ric Flair V.S. Sting (Great American Bash) Ric Flair V.S. Sting (Clash of the Champions I) Rivalry with Macho Man from WWF, Ric Flair V.S. Vader (Starrcade), Ric Flair V.S. Lex Luger (Wrestle War 1990), Ric Flair V.S. Ricky Steamboat (Spring Stampede 1994), Flair returns to WCW to put the belt on Barry Windham, plus there match, And a lot more NWA footage here.",1208908800,4,562,4.352380952380952
3394343,4,B0016MJ6LA,"OK, the Ultimate Collection is pretty darn good and WWE wants to suck old time fans like me out of some more cash so they're going through with this ""Definitive Collection"".

The first thing we need to say here is that I am hoping for a comprehensive documentary on Flair and his career and life.  We got a darn good one on the Four Horsemen DVD but on the Ultimate Collection, Flair just talks and introduces matches and angles and then they show them.  Sure, he gives us a little insight on the motivation at the time but a guy like The Nature Boy needs the full documentary treatment like Dusty, HBK, and Bret have had on their DVD collections.  Plus, they need to do this or it isn't going to sell as well as the Ultimate Collection did because a lot of fans are going to hate the inevitable overlapping of matches between the two DVD sets.

They need to have the 1993 Starrcade career vs. WCW title match with Vader on this new set.  That to me was the most glaring omission from the Ultimate Collection.

Also, bet your bottom dollar that the run-up to this past Wrestlemania and emotional final match with HBK will be on the new set because Vince knows we are all going to go out and buy the WM24 DVD for Flair's HOF stuff and the final match and then he can soak us again a few months later for the Definitive Collection.  Why, because Ric Flair is the freaking man.

3394377,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I remember in my review for the ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" that I said Ric Flair was ""arguably"" the greatest of all time--but after watching the ""Definitive Collection"", it's hard to think of anyone who you could make an argument for against the Nature Boy. Quality wise, I think I might give the edge to the ""Ultimate Collection"" as far as match quality--but that collection used 3 Discs for matches, so naturally I think that would give it the edge, especially since some of Ric's greatest matches with the likes of Steamboat and Barry Windham were used.

But, the Definitive Collection gives us the fans, an all new documentary with the man himself--covering Disc 1--as Slick Ric reflects back on his legendary career; from the glory days of the NWA, to the problems at the end of the 80s and into the early 90s when Jim Crockett was bought out and the NWA became WCW, and Ric left not long after to jump to the WWF. And Ric's return to WCW and his last run in WWE.

As far as Discs 2 & 3, the match quality is excellent, but then again what would you expect with Ric Flair--a man who in his prime could go in the ring with a broom and deliver a 4 or 5 star classic. Some standouts for me; Flair and Kerry Von Erich, Flair and Sting, and of course, anytime Flair got in the ring with Steamboat.

Disc 3 also contains some of the best--and funniest--Flair promos of all-time; 2 of my favorites being ""What's Causing All This"" and ""Golden Spoon."" Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face.

Overall--if you're a fan of Slick Ric--then this is required viewing. 5 stars",1456531200,,1579,4.43448275862069

To me he came across as frank and sincere, willing to expose his inner self for the world to see. The only thing about the documentary that I didn't like was the frequent appearance of HHH. I know they teamed up towards the end of Ric's career, but Hunter was a non factor for the majority of the Nature Boy's career(but of course I understand why HHH is there so much with the power that he holds).

The matches for the most part are pretty good(no match list will please everyone of course). But this is not the only DVD set out there for Ric Flair. Get his other sets for a more complete showcase of his wrestling career. And lastly the included promos were fun to watch. The Nature Boy is pure gold behind the mic.

3394542,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This release coming as a sequel to the ultra successful ""Ultimate"" collection does not or will not disappoint. If you love pro wrestling, if you love Ric Flair, you will find it essential to not only own this DVD, but also the ""Ultimate Flair Collection DVD"" itself.

I will rate everything on a 10 point scale. 1 being the lowest and 10 perfection.

Disc 1:

Documentary (10/10) - Flair really opens up and isn't afraid to pull any punches and tell it like it is. You really gain more respect of Ric Flair, while the Ultimate Collection was more about Flair's matches this documentary is more about Ric Flair the man. Toward the end of the documentary it becomes more of a tribute by fellow WWE superstars Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, HHH, HBK, Batista, and Randy Orton, but also you see an emotional Flair who really chokes up toward the end. This is a must watch.

Special Features w/Flair Tribute video (8/10) - nothing really earth shattering, but you get awesome 2 minutes vignettes of short stories that Flair tells you about his life. Also is the Flair Tribute video which is really nice put together. Nothing earth shattering but worth checking out.

Discs 2 & 3: Matches

Jack Brisco - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 8-18-1982 (8/10) - This was an impromptu bout but what you see is Flair wrestle more of a scientific bout and push his wrestling acumen. It is a really good bout has some down time in it but it is a solid match in this set.

Kerry Von Erich - World Class Championship Wrestling 8-24-1982 (10/10) - This is probably going to be the most under-rated bout on this set. Diehard fans know how great Kerry Von Erich is and Flair and Kerry put on a classic bout which is 2 of 3 falls title match. You will not be disappointed

Harley Race - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 8-31-1983 (9/10) - The precursor to Starcade 1983, the fued of Flair and Race heats up here for a classic title bout. You really start to see here Flair take over as a star and Race performs legendary as well

Ric Flair, Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez - World Wide Wrestling 12-15-1985 (10/10) - The match is solid, not great and not bad either but you get a Four Horseman bout in somewhat of a stable match. Flair had injured Dusty Rhodes and everyone rounds their men up.

Sting - Clash of the Champions I 3/27/1988 (10/10) - This is probably the signature bout on this DVD, if I could I would rate this bout 100. It is a personal favorite of mine and you will not be disappointed. It is 45 minutes of mayhem and J.J. Dillon is suspended above the ring!

Terry Funk - Great American Bash 7/23/1989 (9/10) - This is a great bout from two good rivals. You will not be disappointed!

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - Madison Square Garden 10/28/1991 (7/10) - This is a solid match between two great rivals. Piper who never looked up to anybody and Flair who looked down at everybody. It is a good brawl and is a match more so to remind of how good Roddy Piper can be against the elite!

Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat - Spring Stampede 4/17/1994 (8/10) - A Flair/Steamboat bout is as good as a match as any you can have, but it is disappointing that the WWE didn't put the Chi-Town Rumble bout on this match to complete the trilogy of legendary bouts between Flair and Steamboat. While I can rant over and over about why that match should be on here, this match is really the last great match by Steamboat and the two put on a classic bout here.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley - Taboo Tuesday 11/1/2005 (8/10) - You really learn how special Flair can be in this bout for the Intercontinetal title bout in a Steel Cage. In my eyes Flair puts out that last classic match and both get bloody you won't be disappointed.

Shawn Michaels - Wrestlemania XXIV 3/30/2008 (for the match (10/10) for the sentimental value 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/10) - The match that ended Ric Flair's career is a classic bout you knew Flair couldn't dodge any more bullets but he puts on a great show. You really can not measure how much Flair means to fans and fellow wrestlers. You can argue that you might rather have another match from the 1980's or 1990's from Flair but this match is great.

Disc 3: Special Features

Ric Flair's Farewell Address - I can not score it, it is immeasurable the emotion that night. I remember watching it that night and having a tear in my eye. To me it is not a farewell, but a celebration of excellence and only one man could have commanded that and that was Ric Flair!

Promos (100/10) - I am serious these are hilarious and great. This is what you call mic skills and if you are a wrestler today, or you want to be one, or you just want to learn to be cool watch these. Slick Ric is the the Limousine Riding, Jet Flying, Woman Stealing, Styling and Profiling!!!!!

Overview - While I almost thought is was impossible to top the Ultimate Flair collection, the WWE did. They put together another DVD set that you will not be disappointed in. This set is priceless",1248998400,15,5019,4.471553610503283
3394543,5,B0016MJ6LA,"Being a huge fan of Ric Flair, I wasn't sure about a second three disc compilation of some of his matches.

But the DVD collection was actually fantastic.  The matches were, naturally, top notch.  And despite a repeat from the first set of discs, it was great.  I highly recommend purchasing if you are a fan of Ric Flair.",1232928000,,322,4.406779661016949
3394544,5,B0016MJ6LA,"The first DVD has a lot of new interview time where Slick Rick talks about everything from the plane crash to retirement.  Stuff that wasn't in his previous 4 DVD set.  Some of the matches are the same and not much about the Horsemen as I would want.

Highly recommended!",1231632000,,271,4.38
3394545,2,B0016MJ6LA,"I've been a fan of the Nature Boy for quite some time.  This dvd came out to a lot of hype, but didn't live up to it.  It seems as though they just put a lot of the information in it that was told in the first Ric Flair dvd that was released, with the exception of his retirement. The song that they put to the story line was good, but it is grossly over used in the dvd.  It looks like it was rushed, which the WWE is becoming famous for, and poorly put together.  The matches they included are average at best, and definately not the definative collection.  Had I known what this dvd was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have wasted my money.  I watched it once and haven't looked at it since.",1231459200,,698,4.021739130434782
3394546,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas, and he was so excited he said WOOO!",1231286400,,89,3.736842105263158
3394547,4,B0016MJ6LA,"While Ric Flair's first release in 2003 was indeed the Ultimate Collection as it stated to be. This Definitive Collection isn't quite definitive. But the documentary sure is & the reason why this gets a 4 stars. I was also pleased that they put Ric's Farewell Address from RAW in it's entirety. So I give props to WWE for that.

The first disc only holds the documentary along with  the Ric Flair tribute video & a couple of stories about Ric. Discs 2 and 3 are only matches with the third disc also having a couple of Ric Flair's promos from his NWA days & his Farewell Address on RAW (which is in it's entirety) the night after Wrestlemania. Lets get into disc one...

Lasting nearly 2 hours the documentary in my view really talks about the most important & interesting aspects throughout Ric Flair's career. You will hear from Ric himself & his family, legendary icons including Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Kevin Von Erich, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, former NWA owner David Crockett, Jack Brisco, JJ Dillon, Barry Windham, & others. It covers many of Flair's past from his beginnings in the AWA, Mid-Atlantic wrestling. And his near fatal plane crash Flair suffered very early in his career. Coming back & being the NWA World Champion, forming the Four Horsemen, his feuds with Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, & Sting. Having problems in WCW & coming to the WWE for a short period. More problems for Flair once going back to WCW. Returning to the WWE again & having epic matches with the likes of the Undertaker from Wrestlemania X8 & Triple H for the World Title from RAW in 2003. Forming Evolution with Triple H, Randy Orton, and Batista. And his final days in the business along with going into the Hall of Fame.

Disc 2
Mid-Atlantic Wrestling 8.18.82
Vs. Jack Brisco
This was during Flair's first run as NWA champion. Brisco was the former World champion. Not a match that was originally suppose to be here but one of those matches that Flair got himself into kind of deal. 4/5

World Class Championship Wrestling 8.24.82
2 out of 3 Falls Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Kerry Von Erich
This match was just a straight up war. Flair & Von Erich really fought the living day lights out of each other. If you're not familiar with the Von Erichs then this is a perfect match to see one in. A terrific match for the World Title. 5/5

Mid-Atlantic Wrestling 8.31.83
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Harley Race
At the time, this match was very rare because this match happened on television. And back then they rarely put World title matches on free TV. Race & Flair had far better matches together but this is a match that led to their epic Steel Cage match at Starrcade later that year. 4/5

World Wide Wrestling 12.15.85
w/ Arn Anderson & Ole Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez
Little surprised that this match was on here. It seemed like this is a match that they would've put on the Four Horsemen DVD. But it is a wild & crazy six man tag bout. I would've liked to have the Steel Cage match between Flair & Ricky Morton from the Four Horsemen DVD on here rather than this. But still a good match. 4/5

Clash of the Champions 3.27.88
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Sting
This is the match that put Sting on the map. The crowd was very into this one. Sting did an outstanding job in the ring against the Nature Boy. The only bad thing to say about this match is that since this being on TBS it only had a 45 minute time limit and not a 60 minute time limit. Phenomenal match though nevertheless. 5/5

Great American Bash 7.23.89
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Terry Funk
This match is unusual because its one of the first times that Flair is the face & not the heel. I liked this match very much but I personally like their I Quit match better. Flair gets very bloody here. The end was very sudden though, I must say that. The after math added some good value to it too with the Great Muta & Sting coming out and having a big postmatch brawl with Flair & Funk. 4.5/5

Disc 3
Madison Square Garden 10.28.91
Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper
I wasn't really all too fond with this match with Piper. It didn't suck but it just wasn't my cup of tea so a speak. But it is a rare match to see & a good one at that. 4/5

Spring Stampede 4.17.94
WCW Championship
Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat
While this match being a great one, it just wasn't the same as from their classics in 1989. But I do have to say either way, you will still get a great match up whenever The Nature Boy & The Dragon tie it up and this is no exception. You will still be pleased with this one. 4.75/5

Taboo Tuesday 11.1.05
Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Vs. Triple H
One of the greatest steel cage matches ever. This shows with Flair being north of 50 that Flair can still dish out & take a beating at the same time. In my opinion this is a classic match. A great match up right here. 5/5

Wrestlemania XXIV 3.30.08
Vs. Shawn Michaels
With this match happening 2 months before this release, it shouldn't have been on here. It is a great match but this could've been saved for another Flair classic from the 1980's. But with all do respect, a great match from two of the greatest performers of all time. 4.5/5

As I stated before this is not a Definitive Collection but I think most fans will be satisfied. It wasn't a waste of money & I'm glad I bought it. I also recommend the Ric Flair: Ultimate Collection set along with this DVD. I think the match selection could've been more thought out but overall I was pleased with the product. Very well worth it to me.",1229990400,,5617,4.430232558139535
3394548,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD set picks up where a previous set, The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, released in 2003, left off, and features extensive interviews with the 16-Time World Heavyweight Champion, as well as close friends and former rivals such as Triple H, Shawn Michaels, David Crockett, Cowboy Bob Orton, Randy Orton, Batista, Edge and Harley Race. There are several bonus features, such as the farewell address on Monday Night Raw on March 31st of this year, several promos, as well as extra stories from his family. Matches include opponents Ricky Steamboat, Sting, Kerry Von Erich, Harley Race, Triple H, Michaels, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Magnum T.A. The American Dream Dusty Rhodes, Manny Fernandez and Terry Funk. Owning all three of the DVD sets on the Nature Boy produced by WWE, you have a pretty complete record of Flair's career in all three sets. I highly recommend this one, most assuredly. Get this one for your wrestling DVD collection.",1229644800,,937,5.012820512820513
3394569,2,B0016MJ6LA,"Finally the DVD documentary that Flair fans have been waiting for! Well, not quite... The documentary part leaves areas uncovered and focuses more on the successes of Flair rather than exploring many controversies surrounding his career. Case in point:
-The reason why he didn't have a real program with Hulk in 1992
-His riot matches in Puerto Rico
-His opinion on Bret Hart
-The nWo Horsemen skit
-His 'feud' with Scott Steiner
-His fallout with Bischoff
-etc, etc
All those things are NOT properly covered in the DVD. Now the matches... Part entertaining, part laughing stock puts it best! A match with Jack Brisco in front of 30 people? Yes, they got that! Hahaha On disc 2, Ric wins one match out of 6! Ric Flair is the greatest just because he was the only one who would do jobs for anybody in a period when egos were overinflated! Ever heard: 'He could have made a broomstick look good'? Impossible! A Ric Flair match is 40% stalling and 55% selling... He couldn't amount any offense if his life depended on it! And I don't see him pretending to be hit by a broomstick! Oh well, I can actually (and he'll probably get color too)! Granted he's been in a lot of 60 min broadways that happened to include 15-20 minutes of wrestling spread throughout the stalling, but this is no Bret/Michaels 60-minute type match!

On the plus side, watch the Harley Race/Flair match on Disc 2 and try not to laugh... I defy you!

So 2 stars out of 5 for historical and camp value! Whoooo!",1222819200,,1477,4.548872180451128
3394570,5,B0016MJ6LA,Anything with the Nature Boy is a must buy.  This DVD set has some unseen matches and lives up to it's advertisement.  Definately worth the price.  You get your money's worth and more.,1222214400,,184,4.515151515151516
3394571,5,B0016MJ6LA,"If you're a fan of Ric Flair and his rich wrestling career then you must own this DVD, I know it may lack some matches as other people have said, but hey, the man had an enormous and long career, you can't get all his matches in one set, besides, and probably here's the thing, this DVD set complements the other one: Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen. I own both and I think I have the most complete collection of Ric Flair matches and bio one can have.

My suggestion is to get both because this DVD set concentrates on Ric Flair only with a little on the Four Horsemen, the matches it has are quite good and very good example of his career. I strongly recommend you get this if you're a serious wrestling fan.",1222128000,,708,4.1678832116788325
3394572,5,B0016MJ6LA,"A great guy and, entertainer. I haven't seen every Nature Boy moment so it was nice seeing all these stories from an amazing career. Slick Ric was my favorite part because, of how we know Ric can be with the expensive stuff. And after the story about his plane crash the guy was truly meant to be in this business. Now i want Natch to come back lol. This DVD is not a waste of time!",1220745600,,382,4.0394736842105265
3394573,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I am adding a comment to my review since Amazon has no link to address complaints.  Amazon has decided to sell an E-book that promotes child molestation and pedophilia.  I am now boycotting Amazon until they drop this item.  If you feel the same way about this, I encourage you to boycott Amazon as well.

This is the one.  This set is worth the money for one match alone- the infamous showdown with Sting.  The rest is all frosting (pink frosting at that) on the proverbial cake.  It also covers Ric's struggle to break into wrestling, his influences, and quite a few hilarious interviews.  Also shows highlights from the big WWE tribute.

Highly recommended to wrestling fans in general.",1220054400,,689,4.722689075630252
3394574,3,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD's documnetary is good. However, most of the main topics in the documentary were already included in the Ultimate Flair and Horsemen DVDs. It was interesting to listen to Flair's opinions of Ole Anderson, Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Bischoff. The matches from the 1980's were good to include. However, WWE should have also includeed Flair vs. Vader(Clash Nov.'93 and Starrcade '93). Those two matches were extremely well worked. Steamboat vs. Flair from Spring Stampede'94 was a decent choice, but they may have been better off including his world title win against Savage from Sept.'92 instead. Furthermore, they could have included Flair and Arn Anderson vs. Hollywood Blondes from the Clash of Champs(June'93). Flair vs. Hogan from Uncensored'99 and a Nitro from Jan.or Feb. 96 would have also been intersting. Flair's retirement match was awesome, but the match is too recent to include in this collection compared to other classics ""Naitch"" has had in the '80s and '90s. It would have been better to include HBK from his Rocker days vs. Flair from late '91.
Overall, this DVD was good. However, this DVD should have been great. After all, Flair only deserves the best. This DVD has great promos. The Space Mountainettes promo is awesome. Flair's promos truly made him unique. ""Lookin' only as I can look. What's causin' all of this? Diamonds are forever and so is Ric Flair/Four Horsemen.""",1219881600,,1397,5.0519480519480515
3394575,3,B0016MJ6LA,"Its mainly commentary from HHH and HBK (go figure) pretty much talking about Flair's entire career, which is fine, but what really bugs me is there are very few interviews or less interview time with alot of the old timers in the business who wrestled Flair back in his glory days. Arn Anderson must have had 5 minutes of interview time THE ENTIRE DVD and he was Flair's best friend for so many years. Harley Race had a few minutes,Dusty had 2-3 mins, Tully had 2-3 mins, Terry Funk had NONE, Steamboat had a few minutes. JJ Dillon very few minutes etc.

Anyway, the earlier parts of Ric's career are talked about as they even show a clip of him winning his FIRST NWA World Title. Orton and Batista make brief appearances late in the DVD when Flair talks about Evolution. Ric's first WWE run in the early 90s was barely touched on and no reason was given to even why he left. Also, no reason given as to why they didn't book Flair Vs. Hogan at Wrestlemania 8. Alot of Flair's early career is covered though. I didn't know he was adopted. Talked about how he trained with Ken Patera and how they both started in AWA with Vern Gagne. They briefly skimmed the Four Horsemen era, but that's because of the Four Horsemen DVD. Really the only part of Flair's career that is really touched on in depth is his early career in the early 70s to 80s. Also, the plane crash Flair was in with a couple of other wrestler including Johhny Valentine (Greg's father.) Most of Flair's late career was just glossed over very quickly (even his late wcw days) which was very disappointing. All in all it was a good DVD, but it could have been better IMO. I enjoyed Jake Robert's, ECW, Pillman's, Piper's, Hart's DVDs much more.

P.S.: I'm just glad Sting Vs. Flair from Clash of The Champions was finally released on DVD, its a timeless classic. Also, Michaels Vs. Flair from Wrestlemania 24 is a MUST watch! There have been very few 5 star matches in wrestling history and this is one of them!",1218672000,3,1973,4.432506887052342
3394576,5,B0016MJ6LA,"This DVD is absolutely amazing! :D
Its for any ric flair fan out there, or better yet, Its for any Wrestling fan out there, because as we all know, Ric Flair is the Greatest wrestler of all time.
Woo!! 5 star DVD.",1218067200,,213,4.095238095238095
3394577,4,B0016MJ6LA,"It's hard to condense Ric Flair's pro wrestling career, even on 3 full DVD's.  WWE already did a 3 DVD set hosted by Flair in 2003 (The Ultimate Collection Set).  This complation basically picks up where that one left off with more interviews and behind the scenes footage and fewer matches.

Here you get a two hour long biography where Flair takes you threw his career, from his earliest days in the AWA to the ""Win Or Retire"" angle that played out until this past March at WrestleMania 24.  A veritable who's who of wrestling, from Nick Bockwinkle to HHH add comentary at different points.  Flair is definately honest, and not always nice, although much of what he says has already been printed in multiple books, etc.  Not a lot of new ground, just Flair in his words better explaining a lot of ""old ground"", along with plenty of match highlights and promo interviews from his heyday on TBS Saturday Night Wrestling show.

There are extras such as ""Flair's Final Weekend"" as WWE cameras follow the Nature Boy around Orlando during the WrestleMania Weekend (which included Flair's induction into the Hall Of Fame), and Flair receiving a key to the city in for his charitable work one week prior to his final match.  The complete tribute to Flair from the post-WrestleMania Monday Night Raw TV broadcast is shown, including footage not seen on live TV including Vince McMahon and The Undertaker, among others.

Match wise you get an eclectic mix of famous matches not included in the first set from 5 yrs ago (Sting from The Clash Of Champions TV Special, March 1988 and vs Terry Funk from the 1989 Great American Bash PPV) as well as never before released classics like his impromptu battle with fellow Hall Of Famer Jack Brisco on Mid Atlantic Wrestling TV in 1982 (an exceptionally good match for free TV) and a never before televised battle with ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper from Madison Square Garden in 1991 after Flair first arrived in the WWE.

None of the matches are bad, in fact every one is 4or 5 star quality. Some famouse Flair matches were left off.  Flair's TLC (Tables, Ladders, and Chairs) Match vs Edge from Jan 2006 and his ""I Quit"" Match vs Mick Foley from SummerSlam 2006 are obvious missed from his later years, although both have been issued on other DVD releases. There is a rumored ""Best Of Starrcade"" set supposedly in the works by WWE which may explain why such matches as vs Lex Luger (Starrcade 88, arguably Luger's best ever Main Event Match) and his win or retire match vs Vader (Starrcade 93)were excluded.

Personally, I would like to have seen a Flair/Piper match from their wild early 80's days, although the one here from Flair's first WWE run is pretty good.  Likewise I personally think the last ever televised Flair vs Steamboat Match from May 1994 which ended their feud is better than the April, 1994 Pay Per View bout included here but this is an excellent match.

Combined with the first ""Ultimate Collection"" you get a pretty good overview of the most decorated career in pro wrestling.  On it's own it's better than average, a B plus.  Fact is, Flair's career had so many terrific moments it is hard to condense them, even in a 3 disc set. You definately will be entertained, and the less well known matches are true keepers.  The biography portion is at times moving, and the emotional final tribute from RAW is an absolute collectors must have, easily the single biggest send off anyone in pro wrestling ever got, hands down. If you are a Flair fan you will really enjoy this set, if you are a pro wrestling fan, especially from the last 25 yrs, this set will not leave you disappointed.  Is there more material that could have been added, yes, but this set is still worth the investment.  Plus, if WWE does finish the ""Best Of Starrcade"" set than many of the matches fans have lamented missing here will be on DVD.",1216252800,10,3856,4.627565982404692
3394578,5,B0016MJ6LA,This was a very well made dvd to me. A great story of Ric Flair's career. This dvd was not intended to give us a bunch of matches it is basically a tribute to the career of Ric Flair. This dvd does have some good matches however as said it is not many. They have the ultimate Ric flair dvd that has tons of matches on it this is not that dvd I would call this dvd more of a companion to the Ultimate Ric Flair dvd. If you want the story of Flair's career to go along with the other dvd set I defintely reccomend this dvd. I did not buy this dvd for matches I bought because of the documentary of Ric Flair. If you want to buy a dvd with lots of matches then you want the Ultimate Ric flair. To me you would be missing out by not picking up this dvd as well.,1215993600,,757,3.7974683544303796
3394579,5,B0016MJ6LA,"Just picked up the new Flair DVD. The doc on Disc 1 is amazing along with the stories and tribute video. As for Discs 2 and 3, I want to try to squash a notion I've seen in these reviews.

People are complaining about the matches used for the DVD. The Sting and Funk matches aren't on any other DVD. The Michaels match is mandatory and you know they are going to put a Triple H match on there. The other Steamboat stuff is already on DVD. My only complaint about the DVD is I think they skimped him on the promos a bit for Disc 3 a bit.

This guy essentially has 8 discs devoted to his career which is unheard of and amazing. He's the man. Enjoy what you have folks!",1215907200,,666,4.0
3394580,4,B0016MJ6LA,"I just bought this release yesterday and let me say that it gets four stars because of the documentary, the stories section, tribute video and for showing the RAW tribute segment in its entirety! Now, let's break this one down:

Disc 1 features a near 2 hour documentary on Ric Flair with comments from former NWA announcer David Crockett, Harley Race, Kevin Von Erich, Dusty Rhodes, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, Arn Anderson, JJ Dillon and others. It covers his beginnings from his early life, the AWA, the Mid-Atlantic area (including that near fatal plane crash), his days at NWA champion, The Four Horsemen, his feuds with Dusty Rhodes, Rick Steamboat and Sting, his time in WWF/WWE, his problems in WCW, his WWE return (including Evolution, his Wrestlemania X-8 bout with The Undertaker and his final days as a wrestler).

Disc 1 also features some short stories from the man himself and a tribute video to Flair.

Disc 2 and 3 are just matches and promos. Let's go into Disc 2 for a bit:

Vs. Jack Brisco - Flair was in his first run as NWA champion as he took on former NWA champion Jack Brisco in a mostly scientific match. This wasn't for the title by the way, it was more of an impromptu match.

Vs. Kerry Von Erich (NWA World Title match/2 out of 3 falls) - If all you know of Kerry Von Erich is the ""Texas Tornado"" or just a member of the tragic Von Erich family, you really need to see this! I personally think he was better here than the day he won the title from Flair in 1984! This one felt like a war! This match also led to the infamous cage match that began the epic Von Erich/Freebird story.

Vs. Harley Race (NWA World Title Match) - This was notable because it happened on television and it was rare for a title match to be on TV. It gives you a glimpse of what was to come at Starrcade '83 later that year.

Ric Flair, Ole & Arn Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. & Manny ""Ragin' Bull"" Fernandez - This was a wild six man tag that came on the heels of Dusty's injury at the hands of Flair and the Andersons. My problem with this one isn't the match itself, its great! It is because this entry was more appropriate for the Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen release than this set. I kind of felt the same way about Ric Flair's bout with Ricky Morton on the aforementioned set. That bout would've been a great entry on this one.

Vs. Sting (Clash Of The Champions) - I originally stated that this match was overused. That was an error on my part as I thought this bout was on Ultimate Ric Flair when in fact it was another Sting/Flair encounter. As for this match, I won't knock much because this match proved why Flair is a legend and this match made Sting a legend in his own right.

Vs. Terry Funk (The Great American Bash) - I personally like this bout better than their more famous ""I Quit"" match that took place later that year in 1989. The Flair neck injury angle added drama to the match up. I haven't looked at WWE's version of this match but I do know that afterwards was one of the wildest post match brawl I've ever seen with both Sting and Japanese star The Great Muta getting involved with Flair and Funk!

Disc 3

Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - I will say that I wished they would've put one of Piper Vs. Flair matches from the Mid-Atlantic area on here. Still, its a rare match and it is pretty good. Nothing on the level of Flair/Steamboat or Flair/Sting but it doesn't suck either.

Vs. Ricky Steamboat (WCW World Title Match) - While a great matchup from 1994, it falls short of their classics in 1989. Still, when these two got together, you are hard pressed to find a bad match between ""The Nature Boy"" and ""The Dragon.""

Vs. HHH (Taboo Tuesday 2005) - One of the best cage matches ever! While I do think this could've been left off for another Flair classic from the 1980's, the match itself is great!

Vs. Shawn Michaels (WrestleMania 24) - Another that could've been left off since this WM is now available. But the match itself is a classic so I have nothing bad to say about the match in itself.

This disc also has the Flair Farewell Address along with some promos from his NWA days.

Overall, it isn't a total waste of money in my view but it could've been better. Interesting to note that when discussing the Greenville reunion of the Horsemen, they actually show Chris Benoit (though he isn't mentioned directly). While my opinion of the man is low, I am glad WWE didn't alter the footage just to please people.

Anyway, WWE's latest release falls short on the matches but makes up for it with the documentary and the promos and, of course, the farewell address. On this one, you will have to decide if its worth the price. For myself, I was mostly pleased though I agree that the selections of matches could've been better or at least another disc which I would've gladly paid more money for.",1215820800,46,4841,4.379041248606466
3394581,2,B0016MJ6LA,"Of the millions of classic matches that Flair had, why were we treated to the ones we saw, like the forever showed Clash 1 with him and Sting.....that was on volume 1. Where was the Starrcade 84 vs. Dusty Rhosed, Starrcade 86 vs. Nikita, July 11 1987 match against Jimmy Garvin? I only watched the Terry Funk match so far. I do have another complaint, but not about the DVD, but about Flair himself in the documentary. He was talking way too low, and at times, I had to turn the volume up to hear what he was saying. He was almost mumbling. Vince, this is another DVD that you didn't put together right.",1215820800,,603,4.298245614035087

What makes this great is that it's a documentary as well as a classic lineup of bonus features that include the best matches ever and some great segments.  His Raw send off was my favorite Raw moment.  Before this DVD, I was reliant on YouTube for the Undertaker and Vince coming out and hugging Ric, so this DVD does justice to that day that bookended Ric's career.  Beyond that, this DVD gives some great insight (more) into what really was happening with WCW.  Get this DVD if you have even the smallest interest in professional wrestling.  The Naitch has done it all and is chronicled in this larger than life DVD!",1215561600,,649,4.4576271186440675

3394584,3,B0016MJ6LA,"This dvd set could be much better. They should have focused more on his wrestling matches than documentaries. I mean his last dvd already covered the plane crash for instance. Some day I'd love a dvd set that has all 16 World title wins. I was hoping this would be that set but they have just been releasing too small of sets of late. Plus this is Ric Flair, who cares if you have to pay $30 to $60 for a dvd set worthy of his career. Because this cheap set sure isn't worthy to it. It's nice that it does have 3 rare matches at least but he deserves more. Especially if this is the last time they release a Flair dvd set.

  What I actually want to see is Flair vs Steamboat in early matches before the World title feuds. Flair vs Sting where Flair won the title back in the early 90's has never been on dvd. Flair as the Black Scorpion vs Sting was a classic as well since Flair did moves he has never done so you wouldn't know it was him.

3394585,1,B0016MJ6LA,"This is ridiculous.  The fact that the WWE owns many of the matches from Flair's days in the Mid-Atlantic and his traveling days as the NWA Champ to the territory's such as Florida (CWF), World Class, Georgia, and Mid-South is no excuse to put together a sloppy compilation as this.

Here is what should be on the DVD in my opinion:

Flair becoming the Nature Boy after starting off his career weighing well over 300 pounds and looking anything like the Naitch!

His first few years in the Mid-Atlantic and his feud with Wahoo McDaniel.

His partnerships with Greg Valentine and Blackjack Mulligan.  Winning the NWA World Tag Team title with each and then having subsequent fall outs and brutal wars with both men over the US title.  The hat and robe incident with Mulligan that lead to Flair and Valentine having brutal matches with Mulligan.  The angel where Flair now a babyface asked Valentine to be his partner against Jimmy Snuka and the Iron Sheik, only to have Valentine turn on him and legitimately break Flair's nose with Gene Anderson cane.

His early wars with Rick Steamboat and the infamous ""ugly face"" angel.  Many of thoe matches were classic 30-60 minute draws.

His wars with Jimmy Snuka over the US title and the belt changing hands.

His first shot at the NWA World Title against Harley Race back in 78/79. A sign of things to come.

Champion vs Champion match against Bob Backlund in the Omni from 7/82

The Von Erichs- Flair had classic matches against David, Kerry, and Kevin, including the Steel Cage match vrs Kerry that lead to their famous fued with The Freebirds.

Flair's fued with Roddy Piper and their classic interviews over the US Belt. First with Flair as the babyface and later Piper.

His matches in Florida against a young Barry Windam, Dusty Rhodes from the 84 orange bowl ""Champions of Champions"" or as the Midnight Rider, Matches vs other Florida greats such as Lex Lugar.

Flair rekindles his fued with Wahoo McDaniel only this time McDaniel is the heel and teams with Tully Blanchard while Flair teams with Dusty Rhodes.

More Ricky Steamboat matches from 83/84 when Steamboat comes out of retirement and their match at the Meadowlands in NJ 1984.

I want to hear from the mans mouth about the other title changes and his life on the Road.

Im just saying with all the choices to put on the DVD this is what they came up with?  In the words of the late Gorilla Moonson, GIMME A BREAK!  Vince always talks about giving 110% but this is just not it!",1214697600,11,2489,4.621867881548975

I would love to see a 500 disc set featuring every match the man ever had but being realistic this is a great set.  The Flair/Sting Clash of Champions match and Kerry Von Erich 2 out of 3 falls is worth the price alone.

WWE is at their best when making these types of sets and I expect nothing less than a phenomenal offering.

I can't wait to sit down once again and re-live my youth with the greatest to ever lace up his boots.

Not only are one on one classics like Flair vs Luger, Magnum TA, Koloff, Vader and Savage are missing but they have taken 5 of the opponents from the first Flair set and put in matches against them on this set.

The Flair vs Steamboat 94 is not their best confrontation, as the CHi Town Rumble from 89 and their mid atlantic battles are considered superior. Same can be said of Flair vs Piper as their MSG match was not their best match.

Opponents from the first set take 50% of the matches (including Mr. Backstage Politics HHH). The one true gem is the match against Kerry Von Erich.

The 6 man tag is the only match I have never seen (or do not remember) but having Magnum on the DVD can only be a plus.",1210550400,5,774,4.20945945945946
3394603,5,B0016MJ6LA,"The Ultimate Collection went into Flair's famous feuds, The 4 Horsemen went into the history of the legendary group, but now...we get the story on the man himself in Ric Flair.

The documentary begins with Flair being a ""black market baby"" & growing up playing football before going into how he met Verne Gagne through Ken Patera & eventually go into the NWA though Wahoo McDaniels.  The story behind the plane crash that forever effected his life was gone into before the story of how he became ""The Nature Boy"" was heavily discussed & the importance of his United States Championship run.  Flair's first NWA Championship run, all the politics surrounding it, the responsibility of behind the WORLD champion, and how it effected his family was heavily discussed here before going into the buildup for Starrcade & how his second NWA Title reign was different from the first one.  Flair's ""stylin' & profilin'"" image & lifestyle along with stories behind his memorable catchphrases is talked about next before going into a brief story behind the formation of the Horsemen & their feud with Dusty Rhodes.  Flair's classic matches with Sting, Ricky Steamboat, and Terry Funk are talked about next before all the problems Jim Crockett Promotions encountered leading to Turner buying the company & Flair eventually leaving.  Flair's run as the ""Real World's Champion"" is discussed along with why the feud with Hogan didn't really happen before Flair's return to WCW & how there was problems from day one is also touched upon.  Flair's involvement with Hogan & Savage coming to WCW, the misuse of his character, and problems regarding Eric Bischoff was discussed next followed by Flair reflecting on the last Nitro & WCW going out of business.  Flair's return to the WWE & all the confidence issues he had for months were dove into before talking about his importance in the group of Evolution with Orton & Batista giving their favorite Flair moments before briefly talking about his feud with Mick Foley.  The documentary wraps up with comments about Flair's WrestleMania weekend by going into the Hall Of Fame, his match with Shawn Michaels, and his farewell on RAW.

DVD Extras spread across all the disc are bonus stories regarding Superstar Billy Graham helping Flair bleach his hair, tales of hanging out with Dusty Rhodes & Dick Murdock, how Flair buying wrestling boots foreshadowed his future ""Nature Boy"" lifestyle, Flair's current wife talking about his relationship with Shawn Michaels & Evolution members Triple H & Batista, and two hidden stories about Flair hitchhiking from Minnesota to Florida & a story regarding the plane crash.  Along with the bonus stories come 9 Flair promos (1 was a hidden extra on Flair's first DVD), the tribute music video, highlights of Flair receiving a key to the city of Columbia, SC, and the farewell on RAW with bonus footage of what happened off the air with Undertaker & Vince McMahon making their appearances.

Matches include:
vs. Jack Brisco - This was during Flair's first run as NWA Champion & nothing more past a short encounter that showcased some good old school wrestling & great storytelling by both men.
""Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '82

2 Out Of 3 Falls vs. Kerry Von Erich - This match is very much like a lot of the matches on this disc in that it's a ""lost classic"" that gets overshadowed by their more popular encounters.  While everyone remembers their cage match & the match were Kerry won the title, this was better than both of them.  They went hard for 45 mins. with the first fall not even happening until half way into the match...this was a wrestling war.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '82

vs. NWA Champion Harley Race - This was more of a preview for the upcoming cage match at Starrcade as they went back & forth here in a good wrestling encounter that gets overshadowed by the ending of Bob Orton & Dick Slater collecting the bounty for injuring Flair.  As a side note, you can see why they call Harley one of the toughest men in wrestling as he just kept using head butts throughout the match to hurt Flair knowing those got to hurt himself.
(The conclusion of his match can be seen on Ultimate Ric Flair Collection)
""Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '83

w/Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A., Manny Fernandez - This match didn't last long (around 10 mins.) but from bell to bell between all 6 men, this was a fun match to watch. It wasn't a classic wrestling match by any means but just each man doing what they do best as far as being entertaining & being able to hold the hot crowd in the psalms of their hands.
""World Wide Wrestling"" Dec. '85

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Sting - This was the match that made Sting a household name overnight. James J. Dillion was suspended over the ring in the cage to prevent interference in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today. They went to a time limit draw & had a split decision with judges (which defeats the purpose of the judges in the first place but whatever). When Flair said on the Horsemen DVD that ""we made a career making guys..."", this was the best example possible that fits that statement.
(The conclusion of this match can be seen on the Ultimate Ric Flair collection)
Clash of the Champions I

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Terry Funk - This match gets heavily overshadowed by their ""I Quit"" match later in the year or even by the infamous Thunderdome Cage Match with Sting & Muta at Halloween Havoc the month before that but this match was the one that kicked the whole feud off after Funk attacked Flair at WrestleWar. Just classic Funk in that the match was wild with them beginning the fight on the floor for keeping it on the outside for various parts of the bout. The rest of the match was Flair & Funk one upping each other by focusing on each other's necks & even using the branding iron against each other at one point or another. I consider this a lost classic & a different type of match than what you would see from Flair before this feud.  And keep watching afterwards as they show one of the wildest post-match brawls in wrestling.
Great American Bash '89

vs Roddy Piper - Flair's MSG debut for this WWE run (his original MSG debut is on the ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"").  I made the note on Piper's set that he was missing a Flair match so I'm glad a match from their feud is here.  While this wasn't a great wrestling match, it was very entertaining as Flair tried to play Piper's game of brawling along with both men pulling off their comedic spots just made you chuckle a time or two.
""MSG"" Dec. '91

vs. Ricky Steamboat - They meet in same city that started their famous trilogy 5 years earlier. The match was a nice back & forth encounter between the two that features various ""deja vu"" moments.  However, Steamboat & Flair had 5 years worth of hype & a legacy of their previous trilogy to live up to which they couldn't top in this match.
Spring Stampede '94

Steel Cage Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship vs. Triple H - Without a doubt, match of the night for this PPV & one of the best matches of this year that's heavily forgotten about. Both guys bleed hard (Flair gets busted over in the opening minutes) with Triple H being just vicious & even using a steel chain while on Flair just never gave up & kept fighting back. Great match with the bonus of Joey Styles doing his old fashioned style of commentary which added to the storytelling of the match...even to the point where Joey pointed out at the beginning just how important the Intercontinental Championship meant in this match.
Taboo Tuesday '05

Career Threatening Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Shawn gave Ric the best match he's had since the 2005 series of matches with Triple H. This match was an emotional rollercoaster as you saw Ric Flair pulling out some of his old ""dirtiest player in the game"" tricks on HBK throughout the match while HBK was conflicted with ""putting 'Old Yeller' out of his misery"" & even held back from taking Flair out with sweet chin music early in the match. During one point, HBK returned Flair's slap from RAW & drew ""first blood"" on Flair by making his mouth bleed while later, Flair looked like he was fighting for his life in HBK's figure four & even ripped off the bottom turnbuckle post in the process of trying to get out of it. However, Flair's career was ended with the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"" & the third sweet chin music. This was the type of performance that Ric Flair needed to end his career on...and he got it.
WrestleMania 24

In the end, the documentary covered what wasn't already covered in Flair's previous sets without repeating the a lot of the information & heard from people that we don't normally hear from like David Crockett, Jack Brisco, and Harley Race.  As for the matches, people are going to have varied opinions about this set since Flair had over 30 years of matches to choose from but I felt that all the matches showcased things that either weren't acknowledged in his previous sets like feuds (Von Erich & Piper) or time periods in his career (first NWA title run, WCW run, last WWE run), lost classic matches (Sting), or Flair wrestling different types of styles that were rarely seen from him (Terry Funk). So in the end, I'm still saying this is a 5 star release from WWE that I highly recommend.",1210550400,9,9432,4.644057623049219

3394605,5,B0016MJ6LA,"OK, I just watched the documentary and it is EXCELLENT! The 1st hour is Fantastic! However, it drops off after Flair Comes back to WCW in 1993. Basically Ric says that WCW SUCKED from 1993-2001 and he was glad it was shutdown. I find that hard to believe. His fued with Savage was awesome and that was not even touched on. His 1999 championship is also not touched on. The documentary does pick back up after Ric Returned to WWE in 2001. The last WWE years are covered pretty good(as one would expect!).

Of course everyone is screaming there is not enough matches. I agree. I really wanted to see more Mid-Atlantic stuff with Greg Valentine. His US Title matches from the late 70s etc etc..

All and all I am VERY pleased with the set. However, I have basically every Importnat Ric Flair Match from 1985 Up. Just would be nice to have the all in DVD quality..lol

There are 2 Easter Eggs on Disc 1! Be on The look for them. They are awesome! The first one talks about Tim Woods and the 2nd talks about Rics first Trip to Japan in 1973! Funny Stuff!

This is a three disc set with a comprehensive professional biography and more than two discs filled with matches spanning the 30+ year career of the ""Nature Boy."" It's filled with exclusive footage from WrestleMania weekend, as well as the emotional sendoff Ric received at Raw the night after WrestleMania XXIV, including footage that never aired on television. Features several matches that have never before been released on DVD, from Mid-Atlantic, World Class Championship Wrestling, WCW, and more.

Ric Flair Tribute Video

Disc 2

Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling 08/18/82: Jack Brisco Vs. Ric Flair - A nice number of derogatory comments from Flair to start off this event. Flair plays the traditional heel here being scared of the face, but still taking it to him when he could get the advantage. Kind of a short match, but very good on the technical scale. Still very funny seeing Flair tried coming off the top rope even way back then.

World Class Championship Wrestling 08/24/82: 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship: Kerry Von Erich Vs. Ric Flair - This was long before the late Von Erich had become WWE's ""Texas Tornado."" This match went over forty minutes and is a huge slugfest between two men that couldn't stand one another. Flair became a bloody mess as he usually does and it ended in a gigantic pull apart brawl. Some really good moves and techniques were used by both men, but they were more focused on just beating down each other. Fun match.

Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling 08/31/83: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Ric Flair Vs. Harley Race - Oddly enough Flair was the face here while the crowd really gave it to Race. I've never seen too many Harley Race matches, but I can see what the big deal was. He was a great heel and really showed it in the ring with his mannerisms and sheer brutality. These guys beat the hell out of one another for close to thirty minutes and I'm amazed they could keep going on. A screwjob finish full of interference doesn't take away from how good the match was throughout, but it would have been nice to see it end cleanly.

World Wide Wrestling 12/15/85: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, & Ole Anderson Vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, & Manny Fernandez - Flair was the champion at the time and the Andersons were tag champs. These were some heated rivalries back then and the crowd was going nuts during this match. Dusty had an injured leg and was doing all he could just to stand up at times, but the heels made it a point to show how dirty they truly were. Rhodes and TA were known as ""America's Team"" so taking it to them really got the heel heat going for Flair, Arn, and Ole. Not a bad tag match though that ended up turning into a huge brawl near the end.

Clash Of The Champions 03/27/88: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Sting Vs. Ric Flair - Flair's (the Four Horsemen's) manager JJ Dillon was locked in a cage for this match and raised high above the ring. Sting had the blonde flattop and bright face paint which made him insanely over with the crowd. This was a big-time feud from back in the day which I recall seeing numerous times on different Clash Of The Champions events. At the beginning of the match, the announcers beat home the fact that there is a television time limit for this bout. Needless to say it went the distance and went to the judges' score cards. For the three-judge panel, one was in favor of Sting, another for Flair, and the last called the contest a draw. Flair remains champion, but this was the match that made Sting. Totally in his element.

Great American Bash 07/23/89: NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Ric Flair Vs. Terry Funk - Flair makes his way to the ring with four beauties in long silver dresses. This was before Funk's body was broken and totally in shambles and...hey, is that Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts as one of the ringside security? Weird because I really think it was.

Another good match here as Flair used every bit of technical expertise he knew and really laid into Funk. But Funk is a brawler and, according to what I hear from the announcers here, Flair had a bit of a neck problem. They built it up the entire match that one piledriver from Funk could probably end Flair's career. Funk brought the brutality and kept working on the neck hoping to wear down the champion. Things started breaking down though as Gary Hart interfered on Funk's behalf as did the Great Muta. And an unlikely ally in Flair's former enemy Sting came to his aide.

Disc 3

Madison Square Garden 10/28/91: Ric Flair Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - I remember this feud and it honestly seemed as if they both hated each other's guts. Piper never really had a style because he could be technical one second and then brawl with you the next. There is also a fun bit of humor from Piper included in this match. If you're looking for a match including two of the dirtiest players in the game though, this is it. There is some good brawling and a bunch of behind the ref's back tactics here making this not the most technical match ever, but a fun one.

Spring Stampede 04/17/94: WCW Championship: Ric Flair Vs. Ricky Steamboat - These two had some of the best matches in the history of wrestling and this is no exception. It amazes me just how great these two complimented each other. Never did they have to try and pick up the pace or their own game so that they could make the other look good; they did it on their own. And having Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan calling a Flair match is the icing on the cake because he had this freakish love affair with the Nature Boy that was hilarious. A good number of restholds slow this match down at times, but the near falls and close calls keep the tension mounting.

The ending of this match was a double-pin which wasn't the type of clean ending one would hope for from a great match like this. Flair retained at the time and the double pin didn't ruin it, but later forced the title to be vacated at the time.

Taboo Tuesday 11/01/05: Steel Cage Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship: Triple H Vs. Ric Flair - Future good friends Triple H and Ric Flair would battle it out over Flair's Intercontinental Title in a match decided on by the fans. It was between a steel cage, a regular match, or a submission match. Steel cage won out by a large margin and paved the way for a bloody battle between two of the greatest.

The match went back and forth a lot in the beginning, but then they would eventually exchange control. Triple H went to great lengths breaking out a steel chain and even getting a chair in hopes of beating the Nature Boy. Flair was busted open and had that bloodied hair look early on so it is a wonder how the man loses so much blood and can always continue. Overall this wasn't perhaps one of the matches I would have chosen to be in this set, but it's still a good match nonetheless.

WrestleMania XXIV 03/30/08: Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair Vs. Shawn Michaels - For months Ric Flair had been fighting for his wrestling life. Vince McMahon told Flair that he didn't have to retire as long as he could keep winning, so every match was a possible career ending match. No matter what was thrown at him, Flair still somehow was able to show that the ""dirtiest player in the game"" was not going down without a fight. For thirty-five years he had been the ultimate name in both sports entertainment and wrestling while fans both new and old respected and loved him. This night would be one of his greatest matches and also his last.

Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels are two favorites that have been around for a very long time. Not only have they made themselves look good, but they also make every single person they step into the ring with look good. This match would just go to prove that they deserve every piece of recognition, all the compliments, and each of the accomplishments they have achieved in their careers. This match portrayed them as the awesome competitors they are and they just put on an absolute masterpiece. Flair gave it everything he had, but in the end it was just too much. The Heartbreak Kid wasn't too happy about it, but he is the one that retired the Nature Boy. It was truly a classic moment as Michaels mouthed ""I'm sorry. I love you!"" to Flair before delivering the final blow. No wrestling fan should go without seeing this match.

Extras
Ric Flair's Farewell Address: Raw 03/31/08 - If you haven't already seen this, then I don't know how you can call yourself a wrestling fan. This is from Raw the night after Flair's last match at WrestleMania XXIV, and it is simply fantastic. I believe it lasted about twenty minutes when it first aired and had Flair's farewell speech, Triple H's speech, all his friends and family coming to the ring, and then the entire WWE roster coming out. At about the twenty minute mark is when the WWE exclusive footage kicks in if what happened after Raw went off the air and it needs to be seen to be believed and appreciated.

3394606,5,B0016MJ6LA,"I also have both Ric Flair's DVD's

I hope they put in some 90's WCW Nitro stuff and WWF/E stuff.  I don't think they should put the Hall of Fame induction unless they add the tribute to him on Raw W/Undertaker & McMahon.  If they put the HOF and not the Trib.  i think it's a waist to have the WM 24 DVD and the new Ric Flair DVD

Brian",1209600000,,337,3.757142857142857
3394607,3,B0016MJ6LA,"Some things that I am hoping for:

1.) PLEASE have both a standard DVD release of this title as well as a HD (Blu Ray) version. I see that the WWE is going to be offering a Blu Ray disc version of WrestleMania this year and so I REALLY, REALLY wish they would go to the trouble of making this available in Blu Ray as well.

2.) Whether or not it's in Blu Ray and whether or not this is included in their WrestleMania DVD package this year - this DVD absolutely needs to have the following:
The match between Flair and Michaels from WrestleMania 2008, his 2008 WWE HOF induction, and the final 25 minutes of RAW where they had the Flair Tribute (and this NEEDS to have the footage of the Undertaker and Vince McMahon that was not televised on USA).

3. The earlier poster was correct about needing the Sting Vs. Flair match up from Baltimore when Sting won his first NWA/WCW World title. He was also making a good suggestion for requesting the Lex Luger/Ric Flair match from WrestleWar 1990. I would like to see the Ric Flair and Arn Anderson Vs. Doom match from the 1990 Halloween Havoc and some of the promos that Ric did for that Horsemen/Doom feud.

4. It also always seems to me that some of Flair's best promos from his WCW days are omitted from the WWE DVD sets. It's like they almost want to ignore 1989-1992 when it comes to his promo's and matches in WCW.
Which is a shame because there were some great ones.
I would like an hour or more of nothing but his promos and interviews from 1988-1994.

5. I also remember a few sets of promos Flair did with Shawn Michaels back in 2003 or 2004 that were REALLY good. I wish those series of promos and interviews would be included as well as all of the interviews and promos leading with Shawn leading up to this years WM match up.",1209081600,2,1782,4.275964391691395
