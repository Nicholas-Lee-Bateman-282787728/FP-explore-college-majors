8153969,3,B000K2NHC6,"Produced by Hal Roach in 1939 and released by United Artists, ZENOBIA is a modest comedy set in the Old South and is based on a novel, ZENOBIA'S INFIDELITY, by author H. C. Bunner. Oliver Hardy is benevolent Henry Tibbett, a country doctor who'd rather put a smile on his patients' faces than get paid by them. He comes home one day and learns that his daughter Mary (Jean Parker) means to marry rich and manor-born Jeff Carter (James Ellison). Mary gets her father's blessing, but the same can't be said for Jeff's snooty, blue-blood mother (Alice Brady).

To deepen the plot and introduce the titular character, the circus comes to town with an ailing elephant by the name of Zenobia. Doctor Tibbett is called upon to try to cure Zenobia and succeeds quite admirably, garnering the affections of the pachyderm, who then begins to follow Tibbett around like an imprinted puppy. This wreaks havoc in the good doctor's social standing as Zenobia's persistent presence causes several moments of embarassment for him and his family. To make things worse, the owner of the elephant (Harry Langdon) becomes disgruntled at Zenobia's defection and sues Dr. Tibbett.

Hal Roach originally had Roland Young in mind as the doctor but instead opted to have Oliver Hardy play the role. This is the first time Hardy has ever starred in a film without his longtime comedy partner, Stan Laurel, who had temporarily left the partnership after a contract dispute with Roach. The only other movie he would be without Laurel is the entertaining THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN, where he teams up with the Duke. As Henry Tibbett, Hardy does tone down his familiar comedic persona and engages in some decent character acting, even though some of his patented mannerisms can still be sighted. The rest of the cast are adequate, as well, but no one really stands out, despite some fairly known character actors in Alice Brady, Hattie McDaniel, and Billie Burke, whose defining role, by the way, will always be that of Glinda the Good. Also and unfortunately, the romantic pairing of James Ellison and Jean Parker proves to be so bland as to make the love story negligible.

ZENOBIA is touted as a comedy, but the humor is quite dated. So, if you're not into the notion of elephants gently rampaging in the town passing as comedy, then the film's allure lies in the slice of life depiction of the denizens of the mannered South. I did find the scene of Zenobia at the ball and later in court pretty cute, though.

Be aware that, since this movie was made in the '30s and certain attitudes are consequently reflected, black characters aren't exactly portrayed in the best of light. Here, Stepin Fetchit plays his role of Zero as dim-witted and typically kowtowing, which was a fairly normal depiction for the times back then. Fetchit's portrayal of the subservient black character becomes an ironic element when juxtaposed with Tebbitt's righteous riffs about the Declaration of Independence. It becomes even harder to swallow Tebbitt's heavy handed speeches of equality when, as laudable as they may have been, they're placed right next to his other comments, as in his talk with a little black kid: ""You don't go to white folks' parties. I don't go to colored folks' parties. But that makes no real difference. You understand?""

Hal Roach tried to sell this movie as a comedic pairing of Oliver Hardy and erstwhile silent film comic Harry Langdon, but, honestly, the chemistry just wasn't there between the two. In fact, Hardy shared better screen vibes with the elephant as the scenes involving this particular duo provided the film's funniest bits. So, two and a half stars for this hit and miss comedy, but the stars are mostly for the performances of Oliver Hardy and the elephant.",1168732800,3,3754,4.859375
