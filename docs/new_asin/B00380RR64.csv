8390939,3,B00380RR64,"A well done suspense mystery with a bit of action, more than a bit of romance plus some double crosses, misdirection, and deception. Has a bit of a Hitchcockian flavor to it.",1323820800,,174,4.46875
8390940,3,B00380RR64,"The director earned a nomination for the European Film award in the European Discovery of the Year category.
