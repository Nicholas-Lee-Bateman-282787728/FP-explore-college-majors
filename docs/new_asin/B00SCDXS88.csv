6979888,4,B00SCDXS88,It would be nice if Time Life would just lower their costs on the complete collection and there would be no need for all these other titles with less content they would probably sell triple the amount,1423440000,8,200,4.4324324324324325
6979889,4,B00SCDXS88,"...and yes... I already have all of these programs on ""ancient"" DVDs from years ago... what a PRICE-breaker!

Wow!
What a great collection! I pieced together---from various sellers, here at Amazon dot com---a complete collection of the roasts...
on d-o-z-e-n-s of discs... then, TIME/LIFE came out with a complete set... certainly NOT as inexpensive as THIS.
You will NEVER see a show that was consistantly funny as THE DEAN MARTIN CELEBRITY ROASTS. And,---I dare say---MOST of the
roasters/roastees are makin' toasts in heaven now... Dean Martin; Bob Hope; Jack Benny; George Burns; talk about a historic cast!
These programs---in themselves---originated from 16-18 minute segments from THE DEAN MARTIN VARIETY HOUR... then 60-minute and 90-minute SPECIALS!

Since---due to copyright laws and lawyers---you'll never see UN-edited singin' on Dean's shows, I say why not enjoy "" sting'in' 'n' zingin' ""?!",1421971200,5,903,5.536231884057971
8698114,5,B00SCDXS88,"It was so nice to go back in time when there was real comedy, good clean comedy. Back in this time comedians could be funny without having sexual undertones and having to give derogatory comments of a particular political party. They would make some comments like it but it was not continuous like todays so called comedians it is not pc so if you are easily offended you will not enjoy this classic comedy, but if you appreciate good comedy I recommend purchasing all the Dean Martin roasts as I did.",1531180800,,501,4.516483516483516

8698123,4,B00SCDXS88,"This set, along with the ""Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts""(Red packaging) and ""Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts: Fully Roasted""(Blue packaging), make up 53 of the 54 total roasts done by Dean! Sadly, the one missing roast is Frank Sinatra!!!!  Leaving Frank out of these is unforgivable!! I would have given this 5 stars but for this oversight! They pretty much are forcing people to buy the entire full set at an ungodly amount just for this roast!! How sad!! This set actually has some of the shows that are on the other sets! But, in spite of these omissions and repeats, these three sets are pure gold! Just a word of advise though, don't watch these 53 shows one after another! They get a little repetitious! Better to watch a disc or two, then go a week or two then watch another couple!! RP",1447977600,11,790,4.563380281690141
