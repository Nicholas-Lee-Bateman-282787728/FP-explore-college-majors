3627982,5,B001HAO8NM,"This set of videos is a great all-in-one for those who want to learn yoga because of the amount of things to do on them.  There is a lot of material to work with if you are totally new and need help, such as the one video for inflexible people, but there is also a lot for later on.  The inflexible people alone has things for when you improve.

The other videos are much in the same way in having easier things to work with, and other things.  They are more geared to working on certain issues, such as aches or pains, and also providing general relaxing and energizing workouts.

A great way to get a lot of yoga for those looking to start and have things they can work with for quite a long time.  I like it.",1273708800,3,711,4.079136690647482
3627983,5,B001HAO8NM,"This a great way to learn.  I have been using this awhile and have been very pleased with it so far.

There is one DVD that really helps get you started with modified routines and some regular routines, while the other two are more general with poses that are good for beginners and other things added on to the things to do.

I have been able to work on my flexibility with the DVD that is designed to help inflexible people and also have been able to work on specific issues with the stress relief DVD.  The AM/PM is a nice general DVD with things to energize and relax depending on the time of day.

With the amount of material on all the DVDs it is a great collection even if you do not use all of it.",1271721600,21,705,4.079710144927536
3627984,5,B001HAO8NM,"A good collection of yoga to handle whatever level you are.

Some real good basics to start you out (Inflexible) while other two DVDs provide routines that can be used for beginners and help target things some more.

Great value for what is included.",1268784000,23,250,4.659090909090909
3627985,4,B001HAO8NM,"This is my first set of yoga DVD's. I have used them about three times so far. I found them to be quite slow. I understand that yoga is meant to slow you down, relax and breath, but it still felt like I was just lying there a little too much. Overall I thought the quality was very good I just wish it were a little more intense. I could quite possibly be an intermediate instead of a beginner so this actually might not have been the right product for me personally but if you are a TRUE beginner this is the DVD set for you!",1267660800,5,526,3.9716981132075473
3627986,5,B001HAO8NM,"This set of DVDs covers everything you need - if you are starting out and need extra work, to targeting issues to having workouts to wake up and go to sleep to.

I borrowed one of the DVDs for a couple of weeks from a friend who has been practicing a few years and who started out with the one to increase flexibility.  (She also has the other DVDs and uses them all the time) This DVD is very good to get you started if you have not done yoga or are early in your yoga practice, really helped me get a basis with assistance and then move along.

Stress Relief is usuable by pretty much anyone with routines designed to help stress issues, digestion, hips, neck and so on.  The relaxtion routines are easy to do and very effective.  Though Stress relief has some routines for morning and evening, AM/PM has a wide variety of routines for the morning and evening.

I was able to mix and match as I worked through things and there is a ton of variety.  Will be able to use this for a long, long time.",1265500800,573,998,4.166666666666667
3627987,4,B001HAO8NM,I have only begun to use the video set but was pleased to find it meshes with the routines I have been given in my weekly Yoga class which I sometimes find too strenuous.  So I am grateful for the less intense video sessions.,1262044800,5,225,4.113636363636363

3628051,4,B001HAO8NM,"I have several of Barbara Benagh's DVDs and I find this set a very useful one; I am less interested in the Yoga for Inflexible people, which is funny because that was the main draw for me when I bought this set. To be fair, I did it once and have not gotten back to it and it's been a long time, so perhaps if I tried it again now that I am more experienced in yoga I would like it better.

You can really choose longer or shorter practices with the AM/PM and Stress Relief DVDs. The short relaxations are great for unwinding when I've had a very long day and just want to take a pause but don't have the time and energy for a longer practice. The morning routines can also be just a quick 15 minutes to get moving or else an extended routine, 35 to 45 minutes.

I find that Barbara Benagh explains the movements and their benefits clearly, demonstrates the poses well, and gives me plenty of time to move from one pose to the next. I've been practicing for about a year and a half (but I kinda took some breaks in there, so it was not straight on through) and she and Rodney Yee are among the best for  beginners and the less flexible.

3628103,2,B001HAO8NM,"I had high hopes because of the other positive reviews, but be aware: Reviewers who note the lack of fluidity are correct.  There is very poor flow.  Also, if you're a beginner and wanting to do some of the ""inflexible people"" routines, be aware that you will need a chair.  This sounds like something everyone has, right?  Well, I don't have a chair suitable to the task, which means the vast majority all of the routines couldn't be used as intended.

Also, the guidance in these routines sounds a lot like I did at age 16 trying to talk to a toddler.  Suddenly, rather than using all the simplest words I could think of to communicate, I became excessively technical, using words like ""dexterity.""  In these routines we get references to obscure muscle groups or postures without any explanation at all, and sometimes they're quite important to the instruction in the routine.

Perhaps because I didn't have a chair, the routines I tried were also quite demanding.  Not impossible to do and even embarrassingly simplistic at times, but challenging in the sense of their strength and endurance demands.  I was discouraged quickly by how inept I felt at these ""beginner"" and ""inflexible"" poses.  I needed a better lead-in and build-up to the little-muscle-stamina required for the poses, not just the flexibility.  I think I would've been much better off with a standard yoga DVD, where at least you don't have the psychological pressure of the claim that this is for people who can't do anything...so why are you breathing so hard?

In short: Not relaxing.  Not effective.  Discouraging.  Unpleasant.  Bad flow.

Overall, I felt this was a failed purchase, and would not recommend it.",1471305600,3,1686,4.876760563380282

3628116,2,B001HAO8NM,"This dvd set is a good way to grow your home yoga routine collection due to the sheer number of routines to choose from. The downside is that each routine is made up of several separate video clips.  Because of this the routines do not flow well. The instructor will finish one clip in a relaxing pose, then as the next clip starts the viewer needs to scramble to get into a new position. Very poor flow. Also disappointing that clips are re-used between routines (example: the same video clip for ""modified child's pose"" comes up in the insomnia relief routine and the letting go of the day routine--these two routines were almost identical as we discovered when trying to do them back to back one night).

The pace and explanation are absolutely perfect for a beginner and you can easily increase your challenge levels on your own or with other sessions.

3628159,4,B001HAO8NM,I like 2 of the 3 DVDs in this set.  The ones that have Barbara Benaugh as the instructor are awesome.  There is a different person in the Yoga for Inflexible People DVD and she rushes through the poses.,1456790400,,203,4.17948717948718

3628162,4,B001HAO8NM,"This product is a great deal, however, the video quality is just ok and the transitions between poses is a little jarring. When you go between poses, the screen blacks out and then reappears and she is in a different position. They just took a whole bunch of separate clips of poses and exercises and strung them together (kind of poorly). That being said, I do like all of the different options and will continue to use these disks until I find something better.",1454544000,3,463,4.523809523809524

3628169,1,B001HAO8NM,"The way these yoga sets are assembled is terrible.  Each small block of poses is saved as a separate chapter.  They workouts are comprised of bits and pieces of each set.  There is no fluid transition from one chapter to the next.  For example, I selected a 30 minute session.  At one point I was in child's pose, then the chapter changed and, with no transition, she was standing at the front of her mat ready for the next set.  It really breaks the groove of the session.

I paid $22.48 for this.  I opened it the day after I received it and tried it.  I turned it off and immediately processed the refund.  I only received a $6.93 refund.  What a waste of money.  I'm highly disappointed by the entire order.",1452124800,6,711,4.303030303030303

The narrator actually says that flexibility goals may take years, but that the key is persistence, relaxation, breathing and not forcing the poses.  I would recommend this to any person who prefers to learn on their own rather than heading to a class.

3628201,4,B001HAO8NM,"I'd like to say that I selected this set in because getting 3 DVD's for the price seemed like a pretty good deal, and because the titles and reviews seemed to allow for progression as I get more familiar with yoga, but the reality is I bought this set because of one title:  Yoga for Inflexible People.  Out of dozens of 'beginner' level DVD's that I read about or actually tried from the library, this title alone told me that it is truly for someone who has never done yoga before.  It's the only one of the three DVD's I've actually done (thus 4 stars rather than 5, I just don't know about the others yet), but it's a keeper.  The setting seems peaceful and calming without appearing to be fake or staged, the pace is nice and slow, and the voiceover is detailed enough that I can follow along.  And I LOVE that each series of moves is repeated - so many programs show you the move once and then move on to the next one, so I never really know if I did it right or not.  This DVD does a series of moves, then does it again, complete with the same detail in instructions.  And the 'for inflexible people' is dead on - I feel like I'm being stretched but am not worried that I won't be able to get out of bed in the morning.  Perfect program for those of us who have never done anything remotely yoga related before.",1437523200,5,1318,4.161417322834645

I have done a few routines so far and was not too thrilled with this DVD.  I didn't know who the person who was doing the narration, who I'm assuming is the same person doing the yoga (unless I missed an introduction somewhere).  I didn't really like that it was just the woman doing the poses and the narration over it.  I would have preferred someone actually talking to me while I'm doing it & guiding me through the poses.  The thing that bothered me the most was it was not mirrored - meaning she would say something like 'bring your left leg out'; but it would look like her right leg that she was using, so it was a little confusing to keep up with it without making sure you were using the correct side.  Other than that it is ok.  I'll probably keep using it but will look for something else.",1424736000,2,910,4.255813953488372

I've been using these DVDs for about 6 weeks (4x week or more if I can!) and I'm seeing results I really like.  If you are new to Yoga - I highly recommend this DVD set.  You don't have to be thin, in shape, or flexible to do this.  As a plus - there are several PM routines to help relax and sleep and I sleep like a child when I do these right before bed.  I have never looked forward to 'exercising' but I look forward to Yoga and miss it on days I can't get it in.  You'll need a Yoga mat and that's really it.

3628338,5,B001HAO8NM,"This is a perfect set for beginners to yoga and takes you further as you progress.  I took a couple of classes but could not fit more into my schedule and this is just as good as being in class as far as I am concerne

There are breaks from time to time between movements, with sections normally being 5 minutes or more,much like I have found to be the case in class where you do a pose, then get prepared for the next pose.  After reviewing the material once, it is easy to follow through. There is also some prop used, such as a chair, but it is not throughout all the titles.  Even the inflexible video does not use chairs in every pose and in sections the chair is also just a substitute for a wall.

Bottom line is if you want a power yoga type workout, you want a different set.  If you want to learn general hatha yoga, and use general hatha yoga for things like stress, this is a good selection.  My experience has been more to what Dr. Beth mentioned by far.",1407283200,2,967,4.111702127659575
3628339,2,B001HAO8NM,"Firstly, I'm a beginner. I've never been to a class, and my knowledge of what happens in yoga comes from watching TV. I didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't what was on the DVDs. Everything was discussed in depth in other reviews, so I'll say what particularly irked me about this set.

1) It's slow. I expected to break a sweat and feel like I did some work somewhere, but it never happened. I haven't done the longest ones yet, so perhaps it may happen then, but I'm not holding my breath.
2) the cut aways after each pose is very annoying. I read about it in the other reviews, but thought they were being petty, but they aren't. The bad thing about the cutaways was that the next pose starts from a totally different position than the one previous. So for example you do a pose that ended with you lying on your back, with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, the scene cuts away and then next pose comes on with you sitting on your heels, your torso upright. It would have been better if the next pose started from a position of you lying on the floor so that they is a proper rhythm.
3) The yoga for inflexible people all happen with a chair. I'm inflexible, but not that inflexible. I was expecting some modified poses that you can do when you can't bend over and touch your toes, but can at least reach your shins. This DVD is for a whole level of person, and should not have been included in the set. They could have included Yoga for weight loss instead, and maybe that may have been a little faster, and I would have broken a sweat.

Perhaps I expected too much.",1407283200,11,1590,4.244224422442244

I have discovered since buying the discs that I am more partial to vinyasa yoga, or something with more of a flow from movement to movement. These videos simply direct you to a position and have you hold it, sometimes using a chair, which I did not like.

Though Benagh is clearly a well informed practitioner and educator of Yoga, I found her DVD's very difficult if not impossible to focus on.  She doesn't offer many modifications, which can be frustrating for someone who is less flexible.

I also have to comment on the presentation.  This does not feel warm or inviting, at least to me.  She does a voice over for herself while she sits on the set and does poses.  It is not a conversational style of teaching, in fact, it is not particularly like teaching.  More like guiding (I feel there is the assumption you have done all the poses before). The language she uses can be confusing as well.

I would not recommend her to anyone beginning yoga practice.  Her cold delivery, and the fact she doesn't do the poses while speaking to the viewer took me out of the experience immediately.",1404691200,3,945,4.47953216374269

I've felt progressively stronger and more limber in only a few weeks and truly enjoy the relaxation that the practice confers. I have also noticed that my feet and toes, which had become misaligned and peculiar looking, are now stronger.  My toes are repositioning themselves to their correct conformation and my feet hurt less. What a blessing. The evening exercises are very relaxing and prepare me for sleep. The morning routines are invigorating. Also, if you are having digestive problems there are very effective routines for this as well.

Unfortunately I ran the DVD to the ground. Played it twice a day everyday and now i have to buy another one.  This is the one i bought.  She is amazing.  She explains how to do everything, how to breathe, not to push to hard and not to expect to do what she can do.  I believe in her and listen to her knowing if i just keep at it, i will progress. and I am slowly.  I was sick for several weeks and now just getting back when i saw the DVD was not working. i have express delivery at amazon on its way for tomorrow.  so many people tell me yoga is hard and they can't keep up.  well, i tell them they need this DVD.

I have been doing the AM/PM disc in this set for about a month and a half now and I have seriously improved my overall heath. The first week I was pretty discouraged because I could barely do anything at all, but I persisted. There is one part in particular where you are laying down on your belly with your arms stretched out in front of you; in the beginning, I couldn't even think of trying to lift them even a millimeter, and now I can raise them about 5 inches off the floor!

3628393,3,B001HAO8NM,"So I am starting yoga for the first time and thought that a ""beginners"" DVD set would be right up my alley.....I was wrong.

The DVD set is well boxed and looks nice sitting on a shelf. There are three discs in the set and they are labeled so that you can guide yourself towards the correct starting point. Well at least thats what I assumed.

I placed the AM/PM disc into my DVD player and rolled out my mat. I saw an interview with the Dalai Lama and thought I would give it a listen. This was at 7:30am and I had just risen from the bed so I though maybe a little inspiration from His Holiness would do me good.........BORING. I nearly fell asleep listening to how wonderful we are and how much inner peace we can find if we open our minds. At this point I had a feeling this DVD set would not be for me......and I was right.

After fast forwarding through the Dalai's words of wisdom I moved on the the AM yoga. Now this is disc one and you would expect some sort of intro to yoga since this is a beginners set. Nope, they dive you right into doing poses and most have your head tucked between your arms and into your chest so you can't see what is going on in the video. I had to stop multiple times and look up at the TV to see what the narrator was describing. Many of these moves hurt me and I was under the impression that yoga was low impact.

Let me give you some insight into who I am. I am 5'9"" tall and weight in at 330lbs.....yes I am obese. I am in the process of trying to get healthy and thought I would give yoga a try as I have been told it does not require strenuous movements and thus not hard on the body. This DVD hurt my body.

I tried moving to the disc labeled yoga for inflexible people and it too did not do a lot more then the first DVD. In fact the first pose put me right back into the same pose as disc one that I was not flexible enough to do. You would expect a DVD titled ""Yoga for inflexible people"" to show you alternative poses.....nope.

I am disappointed in two aspects of this DVD set. One, as titled for beginners, I think it can be deceiving and cause people to purchase them based on wanting to learn about yoga. There is no learning in this set, only doing. Two, they need to teach you the poses separate from the routines. Having to stop and learn the moves as they are being done is horrible and cause you to have to start and stop your movement, not how yoga was intended to be done.

With all that said, if you are in good shape and maybe know the yoga poses this could be a great set for you. There is a lot of routines across the three discs and plenty to keep you occupied.

So in the end I gave it three stars, it did not work for me. It was a little too guru for me. It was too peaceful and serene for my likes. I don't want to fall asleep during the program. I am more a DDP Yoga fan. I need motivation and did not find any in this set.",1395273600,6,2892,3.9655765920826163

3628421,4,B001HAO8NM,"These DVDs are great. The one for inflexible people modifies the poses into easier versions.for people who aren't too limber just yet. Even I can manage to do the easy routines on this disc, and I'm an obese couch potato, trying to lose weight, at 260lbs.

I've had to choose the easiest parts of each routine and put them into action, because my heart and weak sedentary-life body can't handle the more demanding poses just yet, but someone who ISN'T obese and keeps at least a somewhat active lifestyle, should find all these routines a breeze to complete.

The voice over is pretty straight forward, enough that you can follow what it says and not have to constantly look at the screen to see what the model is doing. Sometimes the voice over is a bit behind the actual motions in the video, but I think this only happens in the second time around for certain poses.

I like how the people who do the Yoga in these DVDs, aren't the perfect-body, slender, sexy, zero body fat, model types. But instead, they are regular, middle aged women (one of them is the Yoga teacher who's famous, yet her name escapes me), with average bodies and even if they are incredibly flexible and strong, you can also make out a lil belly fat on them and that very lack of perfection is something that I find very interesting and useful for one of these DVDs. I can actually RELATE to these people.

The AM-PM yoga is amazing as well. Again, some poses are too demanding for me, but for a younger, less chunky person, it should all go easy and once you master all these, you'd be well on your way to a better, healthier body and mind.

My favorite is Yoga For Stress Relief, because it has relaxing guided meditations and breathing exercises that truly put you in a mood that can't happen without such sessions. It puts an easy smile on your face and your body feels amazing. Corpse pose is a godsend.

Highly recommend this boxset, as you may notice.",1390867200,2,1933,4.4772727272727275

But really nothing compared to RMs CDs. They are very boring and uninspiring :(",1390608000,,244,4.326086956521739
3628423,5,B001HAO8NM,"I have been using these DVDs for 6 months. I am not new to yoga practice but found that the ""Essential Yoga for Inflexible People"" DVD provides excellent step by step guidance about how to perform each pose that is lacking from the other DVDs that I have been using for the past 2 years. I will admit that I was annoyed a bit by the repetition once I was familiar with each routine but stuck with it because I wanted to make sure I did not hurt my back. Her consistent reminders to lift the spine before moving further into a pose have become habit for me and I feel that I no longer risk injuring my back by pushing into the poses. Working through these routines has enabled me to practice yoga with more advanced DVDs because I know the correct way to get into (and out of) many of the poses.
A downside is that they use cut and pasted sequences to create the full routines (less expensive to produce) so if you do a  focused routine (leg work, for example) and then a full routine, there will be repetition. However, the variety of routines on the 3 DVDs is very good, almost too much in the beginning, but a lot to choose from once you become familiar with the offerings. I use stickie notes to remind myself what is on each DVD so that I can choose the one that suits my needs for each yoga session.
These DVDs attempt to provide the more spiritual side of yoga with the beach setting but are really more for someone who is trying to learn the poses and/or strengthen specific areas of the body.
I rated this set a 5 because I believe that they deliver what they promise for a very reasonable price.",1390089600,3,1604,4.241830065359477
3628424,3,B001HAO8NM,"I like the explanations in this DVD. However, it doesn't flow well. The routines seem jumpy like there is no transition from one move to the next that is smooth. The DVD just seems to go from move to move without telling you to like stand up or sit on your legs, all of a sudden they are just starting a move from standing when the last move ended in laying down.

Overall I like the set, and as a beginner/newbie to yoga I like that this is a multi disk set that I can learn from. I like that the routines have the times on them so I can pick a short session or longer depending on what I want to do.",1389744000,,601,3.886178861788618

I have mainly stuck with disc number 1 and find myself doing multiple routines a day because they are that easy.

They always recommend that you watch the exercise routines before you actually do them, but who actually does that!?  Well, not me.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it would be nice if before each routine they tell you exactly what equipment you will need (i.e. for this routine you will need 1 block, 1 strap, and 3 blankets).  This way you are fully prepared and have all necessary equipment at your fingertips.

3628439,2,B001HAO8NM,"After viewing some of the Yoga for Stress Relief videos, I was surprised to see why the reviews are so high on this product. I seriously regret not going through all of the 362 reviews to get the full picture. The video has no flow with the camera fading to ocean after every few moves and then the instructor is suddenly standing versus sitting or in some other position. The instruction is not the best I've seen.

Despite my previous yoga experience I feel some of her poses are definitely NOT for BEGINNERS. While I am by no means inflexible and have done many twists and backbends in other yoga classes in the past. I managed to hurt my back a few minutes into one of her videos.

First of all, if the routines are meant to be stand alone, not all of the routines provide proper warmup of the back and spine. In other classes/videos, less extreme twists are performed first, slowly working up to the full twist.

Second of all, other videos provide more warnings and say things like ""for more advanced students/for a deeper twist do...."" This video lacks these warnings so it is easy for a true beginner falling along. Fortunately, from previous yoga classes, I could recognize some of the poses and knew where to stop before I seriously hurt myself. This video makes it very difficult for me to trust the video and follow along instead of constantly worrying that a pose will end up straining my back.",1386633600,36,1407,4.531496062992126

I wasn't sure which would kill us first, the fact that I practically needed a protractor and right angle to do some of the positions, ""Now turn your right leg so that it is 60 degrees and your left foot is perpendicular to the wall behind you...""  WTH?  I'm trying to stretch and relax not do math word problems, which I suck at anyway!  Talk about added stress!  Or the grating voice of the narrator.  The Yoga for beginners video was a little better, at least they had someone with a soothing voice you could listen to while you faded in and out of consciousness, but at least you're on the floor so the whole passinhg out thing wasn't a problem.  The best thing I can say about this set is to buy it and invite all your friends over and make it a drinking game.  Make up a color chart going from an actual skin color found in the human race to um, death.  Then have someone attempt a position.

Even when you choose one of the sessions for, say, beginning your day...I feel that the video should consistently take us from one pose to the other, but it doesn't. Instead we do one pose, the example I will use is warrior pose, then the camera cuts away and all of a sudden she pops up on the screen sitting indian style on her yoga mat. So instead of a continuous flow of a session, now you have to stop and set your own pose up as she is all of a sudden and there is no smooth transition from one pose to the other. I don't like that.

This instructor provides a detailed description of how to move from one pose to the next, so it is much easier to focus on the movement and breath.

After getting a different DVD a while back (Weight Watcher's starter kit with yoga block and yoga strap), I decide to get something a bit more varied and that had more moves. This DVD set turned out to be just what I was looking for!

It has easy to follow moves (after a few times going through, the position changes aren't so awkward) and even has one DVD specifically for people who are not quite as flexible as the average person (people like me). There are many, many routines on each disc, each one a slightly different time-length and different moves.

But not for someone who is looking to advance their practice from beginner to intermediate.",1364774400,,422,4.957746478873239

3628564,3,B001HAO8NM,I do not know what I was looking for but this is kind of drab and the explanations of positions is not very good.  It will suffice but I would rather take a class,1364342400,,162,3.764705882352941

3628568,4,B001HAO8NM,"As a beginner, I want to dive into yoga, but this dvd sets the place at the basic level, of breathing. I am quite the impatient person so I kind of found it annoying that it focuses so much on breathing and yet, at times, fails to explain how to get into certain positions. But I'm going to keep going at it and hopefully see some results.",1363219200,,339,4.074626865671642

3628571,2,B001HAO8NM,I bought this set hoping to find a good guided practice to replace the class I had been taking. If I tried to close my eyes are really focus on the movement I found myself missing poses because the guiding was quite lacking. It just wasn't relaxing and peaceful although they tried very hard what with the water in the backdrop.,1362614400,,328,4.39344262295082
3628572,3,B001HAO8NM,"These videos are OK, just not as great as my in person yoga instructor.  I did not like the background music - cheesy relaxing music mixed with sounds of surf.  I much prefer the meditation style of Ravi Shankar type music my yoga instructor uses in our class.",1362614400,,260,4.395833333333333
3628573,4,B001HAO8NM,"These is a great box set, AM and PM 30 min, but teaching you proper breathing and practice lengthening of the spine.  Worth the money.",1362528000,,134,4.36
3628574,5,B001HAO8NM,This boxed set was everything I was looking for. It is very informative and easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to try out Yoga for the frist time. It is fantastic.,1362355200,,190,4.162162162162162

3628576,5,B001HAO8NM,Awesome. I love this video. I am a beginner and this gives me some options based on how I feel. I can also dig into some more advanced stuff a little at a time. Her voice is very relaxing and she is very good at explaining poses and what you should be feeling to keep you on track. Loving it.,1362182400,,292,3.8833333333333333

So, I ordered this set for her so she could begin at home.  She has tried several of the programs on these DVD's and is pleased with the instruction and the easy format. There are programs lasting from 10 minutes to 45 minutes so she can choose a program based on how much time she has to spare.  I also have used Barbara Benagh's Yoga DVD's and have been exceptionally pleased with her style.",1362009600,,567,4.423076923076923
3628578,4,B001HAO8NM,These DVDs are fine to use.  Beginners need to understand that some of these are for beyond beginning level & need to be used with some common sense.  They show a variety of poses.,1361923200,,180,4.264705882352941
3628579,5,B001HAO8NM,"I love it! I have tried all three of these DVDs; they have an amazing value. I particularly like the two Barbara Benagh DVDs, but there is a wealth of material included here, all of which might be applicable, depending on your level. It's very useful indeed",1361491200,,257,4.48936170212766
3628580,5,B001HAO8NM,"Yoga for Beginners is excellent - still haven't made my way to Yoga for Stress Relief or Yoga for Inflexible People.  Easy to follow instructions, lots of gentle encouragement, plenty of options based upon one's ability to commit time to the practice, from fifteen minutes on up.  Barbara helps a yoga beginner get true benefit from the exercise without a superior attitude.  Highly recommend this one!",1361318400,,402,5.0606060606060606
3628581,1,B001HAO8NM,I bought this because it said it was for beginners but I really have to say I'm not fond of it. It doesn't teach you the moves ahead of time and moves pretty quickly. Maybe for someone who had already had some yoga experience it would be okay but I never have and found it hard to follow. When you're face down on the floor and they tell you to do a specific move you have to continually look up at the tv defeating the purpose of the stretching. I'll keep using it and maybe it will get easier as I go. The seller was great though.,1361232000,24,532,3.9813084112149535
3628582,5,B001HAO8NM,I have a quite few yoga DVDs but this one is my favourite.  I don't often have the time to spare so perfecting techniques and poses is a discouragement. This set has a variety of options with several are short and easy to do routines that do not require a great deal of expertise.,1360972800,,280,4.185185185185185
3628583,5,B001HAO8NM,"This set of DVDs has everything you need as a beginner - if you are starting out it helps you to walk through each pose, slowly, targeting perfection. Plus the beach background is stunning and its sound brings a peaceful sensation during the exercises. I am so happy with this set.",1360886400,,281,4.529411764705882

3628585,5,B001HAO8NM,"Since I can only attend one yoga class a week, I wanted to add at least one additional session at home.  This set really helped me. There are so many programs on the set, I don't think I will ever get bored.  The sessions are carefully demonstrated and explained, and I was able to keep up with the poses even though much of this is quite new to me. I'm really happy with this purchase.",1360454400,,386,4.133333333333334
3628586,2,B001HAO8NM,This video is great for absolute beginners who want to focus on the breathing and meditation aspect of yoga. I wasn't an absolute beginner and I definitely didn't want to just focus on the meditation. What really ruined it for me was the lack of variation in routines. Every routine was essentially the same one made longer or shorter.,1360454400,,335,4.694915254237288

3628589,5,B001HAO8NM,"This is an excellent DVD for people who are wanting to do yoga but are not advanced nor flexible. There are several DVDs in the package, which of course is great so you don't get bored with the same one all the time. I put it in my laptop which has a big screen, and there is one lesson that is situated right by the beautiful ocean, soooo nice if you are wanting to relax, and who isn't? And a special treat is a section with HH the Dalai Lama, which I did not expect, but really am happy about. I find the directions to be easy to comprehend, very straightforward.
A good DVD for beginners!",1359849600,4,592,4.112068965517241
3628590,5,B001HAO8NM,Love this CD.  Yoga is a great love of mine and this one is very easy to understand and do the poses.  I would highly recommend these DVD's.  You can't go wrong with them.,1359849600,,171,3.9705882352941178
3628591,3,B001HAO8NM,"The first disc, AM/PM yoga, has great poses, but I quickly realizes the poses are roughly cut-and-pasted together. The second disc, essential yoga, has mis-matched video and audio. The video part of the demonstration is great, the postures are very professional. The accompanied vocal instruction, however, does not match up to the moves of the video. The narrator frequently mistakes the left and right side and often leaves out narrating the next steps. This can be very confusing for people following the videos at home. The instructor also does not provide cool-down poses.",1359763200,5,577,5.21505376344086

The ""Yoga for Inflexible People"" dvd is great for those days when you wake up stiff and sore and don't feel like you can move very well, or as a nice, gentle warm-up for one of the longer workouts.  The AM-PM yoga is great for any time of day.  You can't go wrong with this set!

He wanted to become more flexible and have something for stress relief and I wanted to start it after having my son until I get back in shape to doing Pilates and more intense workouts! It is a great starter set, we really enjoy it! I love the different time ranges so somedays if we are running late we can do a quick one or when we need a longer one we have that option too!

3628597,5,B001HAO8NM,"So far I'm very happy with this set.  I've done about 3 programs from 2 of the DVDs and they were all good.  I'm finding this style of yoga very helpful for getting rid of the tension in my muscles and I'm getting back some of my flexibility I haven't seen for years.  These are beginner programs.  I've done very little yoga before and not since quite a long time ago.  I'm able to do everything I've tried so far, some poses with a bit of modification for now.  If you are really inflexible and have any trouble with the programs for stress or the am/pm, definitely start with the inflexible programs first.",1358812800,,609,4.345132743362832
3628598,2,B001HAO8NM,"This is very basic - even too basic for a beginner.  I did not care for how there is a voice over rather than the instructor speaking.  Oddly, I found it to be very distracting.  I was hoping to learn techniques geared toward mind as well as body relaxation, unfortunately, this was not the case.  I am sure many getting into yoga do so to learn those relaxation methods yoga is known for, myself being one of these individuals.  It just did not assist in this area as I thought it would based on the product description.  I am sure many people will enjoy this - it was just not for me.",1358726400,,586,4.1875

3628600,3,B001HAO8NM,"I've had these tapes for two weeks now and what I don't like about them is that the routines are pieced together from individual segments and there is no continuity, no flow.

For example, it seems that each pose is filmed as its own separate entity, and routines are just combinations of these poses, so one pose can start off sitting and then the next pose in the sequence starts off standing and there's no instruction on getting from one pose to the other.  You just end up sitting from the first pose then all of a sudden have to find yourself standing to start the next one.  I just don't like that, but maybe it's just me.  I only have 2 other yoga tapes and those were filmed as a continual sequence so I'm used to that.

I do like the woman that does these videos though.  She's very calming and good with explanations on how to modify poses if you need to.  She's inspiring and doesn't talk too much or too little.

If the routines were filmed as one solid piece I would like this set better, but it's not the worst I've seen either.",1358640000,3,1043,4.258883248730965

This man last 140 pounds and is now running.  I thought I would try yoga for myself and after finding this tape and trying it myself just 4 days ago I can boost that I have improved at least 30 %.  I am no longer wobbling and even my knees feel better and they have hurt for years.  I will say today is 5th day and I have not worked it and already feel like I am  missing a very valuable part of my day.

One year later, I still do these daily. It's great not only for your body, but also your mind. Barbara Benaugh has a very soothing voice and teaches you good breathing techniques to decrease anxiety and stress. It really works! There are also so many different segments that you can pick and choose (which is why I don't get bored doing one everyday). Highly recommend this product!!!",1358380800,3,539,4.510204081632653

And there is so MUCH and so MANY different segments to follow with a wide variety of times. So if you only have 15 minutes or if you have 45 minutes there are many different workouts to follow.  The instructor is also great and shows many modifications or talks about modifications and safety throughout the video and I never feel like I can't follow along being a beginner in Yoga practice.  The only thing I do not like is the DVD that is for inflexible people, it uses a chair in every segment and I personally don't use a chair so that DVD is the only one I do not use.",1357084800,,684,4.097014925373134

The wide range of routines and the positive reviews prompted me to purchase this set.  I've never attended an actual yoga class, which I'm sure is unwise, from a possible injury perspective.  So far, so good - knock on wood!  I found most of the routines easy to follow along to, although, as a beginner, I spent more time focusing on the instructor, rather than myself.  I'm sure that will change as I improve and gain experience.

I enjoy doing a short routine on a weekend morning and a longer routine to wind down at night during the workweek.  I have not yet tried the ""Inflexible People"" routines, as that's not a problem for me, but I plan to check it out to see if there are some useful stretches.

I do feel more relaxed and have developed more flexibility as I have been doing this, which are two things that I was hoping for.

The teacher's are very good in describing what to do and giving tips along the way as you move through things, such as saying ""if you cannot bring your arm all the way up, bring it as high as you can"" which makes things less intimidating.

Happy with my selection.",1355616000,,658,4.125

And at that point there was still alot to do.  After the first couple of lessons on the first DVD, I started learning more moves and had more challenges.  There is even more to do still.  On the others I could do some of the things, and picked up more as I went on.

3628644,1,B001HAO8NM,"I bought this CD with the intention of learning basic yoga and strengthening my flexibility skills since for my age (26 years old) I am not flexible the least compared to other girls my age, and I must say that this CD was not very helpful. It did nothing to aid in strengthening my flexibility skills and as far as the yoga aspect of it, I found it boring simply because there is not much to it! The fact that it came with 2 discs was what had made me purchase it above all, as I thought it would be quite diverse, offering many options as to what kind of exercises one can do. Unfortunately the discs barely have any diversity, I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over.
If you are looking for something that is enriched with all kinds of exercises and that aids in strengthening one's flexibility skills do not purchase this you will be disappointed.
On the other hand, if you are looking for something that is extremely basic and has only a few exercises, then this may turn out right for you.
I just don't see the point, even for beginners, to chose this cd cause after a few exercises it's over and one is left feeling as if they didn't really do anything.
What I was looking for was something that would be easy as far as exercises, yet it would have so many of them that one would feel they are really learning something, as well as getting a good basic level work out from it.
I advise women below the age of 40 to stray away from this, it is so basic and ""poor"" as far as the number of exercises that I could only see older women in their 50's and above to enjoy it, that is if they are not the athletic type. Any other woman who is active in her life and doesn't minds sweating a bit when exercising will be disappointed from this. It seems to be designed not only for people who have 0 flexibility but also for people who do not like to sweat or put any effort when they work out.
I wasn't looking for something challenging, like I said, it's for beginners and I am one. But I expected something that would keep me immersed in its exercises instead of saying to myself in the end ""that's  all there is to it?""",1347494400,14,2132,4.174757281553398

As a yogi who has seen the positive effects of yoga on the mind and body, I was always encouraging her to sign up for a class. She finally said she just didn't have the time, energy, or money to commit to a class but would be interested in a DVD she could use at home. I had this one mailed right to her door for Mother's Day. After discussing the potential effects yoga could have on her, she committed to doing it every day for 10 days. She has gotten so excited about trying out all of the routines she has been doing the 15 min yoga for beginners in the morning PLUS a 20 minute session of the other ones at night and is loving it! For someone who has been to the gym maybe 3x in 5 years she has found a true enjoyment out of the simple exercise for beginners in this video!

I knew I had to do something, and since I had never tried yoga before, I thought I would give it a shot. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on this 3 dvd collection. What convinced me was the words ""For inflexible people"" - that was me, totally inflexible. The first day I barely made it through the 5 minute warm up, but I persevered, and now, after just 4 short weeks, I do a 50 minute workout, have lost 4 pounds and 2 inches off of my waist, I feel a lot more energetic (as opposed to the zero energy I had before), my back feels great!!!, my headaches are almost completely gone, and I have been getting the best sleep I have had in years. I am a complete convert to yoga. The dvd ""Yoga For Stress Relief"" is my favorite because it lets you target real problem areas which for me is my lower back and hips. I am amazed at how much good these poses can do a person in such a short amount of time. I just wish I had started doing yoga years ago.

On the inflexible dvd, start with the first lessons, it may be easy, but worth a start and you can move on.  On the other two videos, pick some sections you want to start with.  The AM/PM has 6 for the morning and evening, pick one of each even if just relaxtion/lying down to start.  Helps with the breathing.  Look over the general things the stress relief also.

Maybe they mentioned it for one or two times but did not took time to show the easier versions.  What I have seen in other videos is that the instructor gets two assistants, one highly flexible and other shows the easy version of the exercises. Not in these videos.

Also I do not feel inspired by the instructor. If after doing Yoga you get in the shape the instructor is in then you definitely do not want to do yoga.

BUT each set that says its for indigestion, anxiety, or whatever are all the same moves put in different orders. The instructor for the stress relief yoga is alright, and has an okay voice. As for the other DVD's, they're CRAP. AM-PM yoga wakes up your body, but the explanations are awful. The worst is the ""Essential yoga for inflexible people"", the narration is HORRIBLE. Whoever is talking and directing the moves continually stutters, saying the wrong word, then correcting herself in a stutter of the right word. Her instructions DO NOT always match the person actually doing the moves. This makes for an irritating exercise. Also, there is no flow to the yoga DVD's. You don't have the option to play all the sets at one time from any of them. Some are only 8 minutes long, so its tedious having to do a short yoga position, then break rythym and change to the next. There's got to be something better out there, and I have no idea how this got 4 1/2 stars.

The first one I did off this dvd was an AM one for 45 minutes.  Barbara has a voice that is soothing enough, but I still prefer Shiva's.  What I did not like AT ALL was that instead of flowing from one pose to another, it cuts right into her already in the next pose, so there's no smooth transitioning from one to the next.  I was still in downward dog, and scrambling to the next thing, which to me is not relaxing.

Stress Relief has 5 major sections of things to work on, such as insomnia, neck and back pain and also general selections.  The AM/PM is morning and evening things to do.  These last two videos have routines that can be done by beginners, but also have a great number of poses to work with which makes them good also for overall use.

Some of the poses are done in a very calm, slow fashion so that you are able to get the hang of it. I read some other reviews that said the video was choppy because there is no fluid transition between the exercises, but honestly, there isn't a very fluid way to get from a sitting position to a standing position.

I gave the inflexibility Dvd to my brother because he likes yoga but he cant touch his toes. Its working wonders for him. If you're a beginner I highly suggest you use it.

Has many routines for Am & Pm and different lengths depending on how much time you have and longer routines for when you`re ready to move forward. Ane believe me Yoga is Not a walk in the park. Its a very nice workout and wonderful for stiff muscles... Just ordered the Yoga for weight loss with Maggie Rhoads--(one of the instructors on the beginners dvd) I really like her instruction & although I don't need to lose weight-just want to do a little more challenging workout as I get better at it..Its a really good set of DVDs and a Lot for the money!,1327190400,,946,4.146739130434782

After 7 years of more challenging and satisfying practices, this was quite depressing. Much to my surprise, these DVDs turned out to be just what I needed, however! Not only was I able to ease back into my yoga practice with comfort and confidence, I gained new insight into old poses. Some of the poses were brand new to me and all of the old poses had new interpretations. The DVDs are divided into small 15 minute segments to mega 90 minute segments - no excuse to not do your daily yoga. The Yoga for Stress Relief DVD is amazing! I was able to alleviate most of my neck, shoulder and lower back pain within 3 sessions.

I've participated in yoga before but always struggled with breathing and making accomodations for the poses I didn't have mastered or wasn't flexible enough to accomodate.  These videos address those concerns!  One video is focused on inflexible joints and how to accomodate and how to work to increase flexibility.  A second video focuses on specific target areas or problems:  headaches, stress relief, constipation/diarrhea, etc.  The third video has become my mainstay for a.m. and p.m. yoga work outs.  I find I enjoy the a.m. yoga the best, but when I don't have time or don't feel like getting up early to do the a.m. workout, I use the p.m. workout as a refreshing and relaxing alternative.  I really appreciate how the poses are described as well as detail on what to focus on as a beginner.  I've even been able to get my husband to do a few of the workouts and he was impressed with just how difficult yoga and these workouts can be.  Don't let ""difficult"" make you shy away.

The instructor uses a chair and yoga props to modify poses to the most remedial flexibility level to start then works things up.  I never thought I'd be able to get anything out of yoga until now.

I've tried other DVD's and everything was too hard and I couldn't even begin to do it.

I got these DVD's in the mail yesterday and tried it out today.  I started with the AM Yoga for Beginners DVD.  It was too hard!  I couldn't even make it 5 minutes in.  I felt like I would fall over any second and I couldn't make it into most of the positions.  Feeling very disheartened I put it in the DVD for inflexible.  Apparently I'm that bad!  But it worked.  I Yoga'd like an inflexible pro for 30 minutes and I felt great after.  I think the inflexible was meant for seniors, that I am not!  I am a 31 year old woman who is just very inflexible.

I also really enjoy the am-pm yoga dvd as it has very nice routines for getting ready to start your day, or slowing down and relaxing in the evening. I really like that it provides customized routines so you can pick a routine based on what is provides, and it tells you the length, so if you only have 30 minutes you can pick a yoga routine that works for you and your time constraints. For example, the yoga for stress relief dvd has various routines based on different issues (stomach upset, tension headache, lower back pain, neck/shoulder pain or tightness, and so on. I also use this dvd regularly to relax my neck and shoulders from tension I get due to migraines.

3628708,4,B001HAO8NM,"(Updated at end of review)This video was really not what I was looking for. I was really disappointed to find that the ""routines"" in this video series were not actually routines, but a collection of individual poses edited together. The video actually ""fades to black"" after each pose. There was no transition from one pose to the next. This made the video feel extremely choppy and not at all conducive to relaxation. I was really hoping for a video that would mimic the experience one might have if one were to attend a yoga class at a studio. Instead, it felt like more like a catalog of poses that that a more experienced yoga practitioner might use to form their own routine.

Update: After spending a bit more time with this video series, I had to come back and change my review from one star to 4 stars.  Indeed, it really was not what I was expecting or looking for.  I wanted a traditional exercise video and this is not one.  However, the sheer volume and variety of routines on this video makes it worth owning.  I still don't love the ""fading to black"" after each pose, but this has become less distracting over time. I particularly enjoy being able to choose a 10 minute session or a 50 minute session depending on the time I have available.

I am out of shape and inflexible, so doing the beginner yoga is still too advanced for me. I prefer doing the sun salute and the yoga for neck and back pain. I do this 7 days a week, so far this is my 2nd week in doing the sun salute (inflexible people dvd) and neck, shoulders and back pain (yoga for stress relief dvd). I feel great and my body yearns for more. I am excited to do these everyday (7 days a week, 1 hour each day). I am 38 y/o female, 214 lbs, 5'1"", I have large breasts which tends to add to any pain or stress I feel. I do whatever my body can do and I do a little more each day. Not pushing my body but gradually do a little more each day.

I do modify a few poses because I am just not that flexible yet nor do I have upper body strength. Take the poses at your own pace. Just keep working at it. I feel a lot better mentally and physically and it's only been 2 weeks. That's enough motivation for me to keep going. I do my yoga dvd 1st and then I do 1 to 2 circuits from Jillian Michael's dvd ""No more trouble zones"". I feel really gooooood right now. If you thinking about, do it, even if it's just for 1 minute, just do it.
At this point any exercises I can't do, I modify it, in the way that's easier for me, then within 2 to 3 days I am actually doing it gradually. Did I tell you, I feel really good!!",1313280000,191,1493,3.831715210355987

This is one of the best investments anyone could ever make not only for your health but for everyday life. I love how the DVD's are separated into moves for different times of the day and for chronic issues like back pain, neck pain, etc. So you know where to go on the DVD depending on the issue you're trying to work on. The third DVD (for inflexible people) is a bit fast, and doesn't explain the reason for the stretch just tells you how to do it. So it's not as relaxing.

3628716,5,B001HAO8NM,"So many people I know rave about yoga but I'm just not ready to go out and pay $10 each class for something I won't get the full benefits from because I'm such a beginner. I thought maybe I should start with some videos in the privacy of my own home. I just searched on here for ""Beginner Yoga"" and this popped up. I saw ""Essential Yoga for Inflexible People"" and knew I had to get this! Having read several of the reviews, I knew all 3 discs would come in 1 DVD case--I actually prefer this because it takes up way less room. Anyway, I've done routines off of all the discs now and have appreciated each of them. I initially skipped over the short routines on the ""Inflexible"" disc, thinking, ""Okay, I'm not very bendy, but I don't need a chair... that's probably for seniors or people who have had surgery!"" But when poses using the chair or other props (a block, some blankets, or the wall) have come up in the longer routines, I have found that I get way more out of doing the modified poses because the props really help me keep the proper form. I can concentrate on feeling the stretches and my breathing rather than trying desperately just to hold the poses! I'm definitely enjoying doing this a few nights a week and am ordering a couple more videos from the same company.

Some of the other things I appreciate about this set:

*There are very short intros to the discs (most other workout DVDs I have used have LONG introductions that you cannot skip through... those drive me crazy! These discs all go almost immediately to the main menus)
*There are many routines on each disc. I've been using these for a few weeks and have barely repeated any routines (many of the routines have some of the same elements, but having them in a different order keeps it from getting boring, at least for me)
*The routines on all the discs are labeled pretty specifically (e.g., ""Breath Work"") and include the length of time for each routine. I was surprised by the lengths of some of the routines (there's everything from a few minutes to over an hour)

And a random side note: I especially love the relaxing and unwinding parts of the evening routines on the AM/PM disc.

Also: I can almost touch my toes now :-)",1312070400,2,2209,4.42014742014742

The programs are divided out according to what you want/need and the time for each segment is listed.  I was surprised at how many options I had to choose from.  If you are looking for a flowing 30-60 minute yoga routine you will not like this format.  It is pieced together and each segment is in the menu.  I also purchased a 3 dvd set for my 24 year old son who is just starting yoga and he loved the hip segments; he works at an office and sits all day. He too noticed the quick relief on the hips.  The leader talks and moves very slowly which helps get the full effect from the poses.  Highly recommended for anyone with hip, neck and back issues - I love it!",1311552000,,773,4.1066666666666665

This DVD is my favorite of the three, and one I still use quite often.  The practices are broken down into four different areas of concern:  1) Beginning and Ending Your Day, 2) Neck, Shoulder, and Back Issues, 3) Easing Your Mind, and 4) Stomach and Digestion Issues.  All of the routines are quite relaxing and largely restorative.  They range in length from 15 to 60 minutes and should be doable to most levels of practitioners.  Some props are necessary, including at least one blanket on hand (preferably 2-3), a strap, and a bolster/firm pillow.

This is another wonderful DVD from instructor Barbara Benagh.  Here the focus is on routines intended for either the a.m. or the p.m., but I've been known to mix-n-match the practices at any time of the day.  Again, the length of the practices varies (from 15-45 minutes), and the same props as described above would be helpful here.  A few of the routines, such as ""Gentle Wake Up"" and ""Good Nights Sleep,"" are performed entirely on the floor; one of my favorites is ""Get Up and Go,"" which is a short practice (15 minutes) that offers a wonderful series of upper back openers.

Out of the three DVDs, this is my least favorite.  However, the main reason for that is that this is the DVD that is the most beginning level (it moves at a VERY slow pace), and I'm not a beginner myself.  If you are a beginner, this DVD might be a good place to start, as it has practices divided into three sections:  1) Short Routines--Learn the Basics, 2) Short Routines--Continued, and 3) Extended Routines--As You Progress.  The practices vary in length from under 10 minutes for some of the shorter routines to a full 90 minute session.

In the end, if you are a beginner to intermediate yoga student, I think it would be hard to go wrong with this set, which offers hours and hours of options.  Highly recommended!",1309996800,442,2807,5.546948356807512
3628721,5,B001HAO8NM,"A must for anyone looking to begin yoga. I have hardly any flexibility, but after this all the tension in my body is gone. Such an amazing feeling!",1309392000,,147,4.285714285714286
3628722,2,B001HAO8NM,"I didn't realize that these were not set routines, but rather series of poses, with breaks in between each pose. Therefore, it is up to you to make your own transitions. I wish that I had known that prior to purchasing. I figured that I would be a little advanced for these dvd's in terms of yoga knowledge, but right on par in terms of strength and flexibility. Unfortunately I was right on the first account and wrong on the second. It's still waaaay to easy. Most of the inflexible DVD uses a chair for balance, making it totally useless to me, as being of average flexibility and in my 20's, I can touch my toes with no problems. I think a more appropriate name for this DVD set would be yoga for elderly or less mobile people as those are the types of modifications it provides. Overall, I would not purchase or recommend.",1308787200,11,827,4.376623376623376
3628723,5,B001HAO8NM,"I hadn't done yoga in many years, and I was worried that it would be too difficult, even though this item is for beginngers and inflexible people.  It is not too difficult!  There are 3 dvds and each one has multiple choices for which type of yoga you want to do.  It ranges from super easy for out of shape and inactive people like me, to more complex and difficult for those who are ready to take it to the next level.  It also has several different choices:  yoga for morning, yoga for stress relief, yoga for evening...  quick yoga excercies for when you don't have much gime, longer yoga lessons/exercies for when you DO have time... etc etc etc!  Extremely versitile, and easy to create your own workout with these dvds.  I was very impressed!",1308355200,9,749,4.455882352941177

3628726,4,B001HAO8NM,"I am a beginning yoga ""student"".  My only experience is really with these videos.  There are a lot of routines to do ranging from just stretching to meditation.  I just wish there was a bit more strength training with it.  But I'll get that through other videos.
The product image does show this as a ""boxed set"", like you would get a box w/ individual cases and DVDs.  But it comes in one case, with 3 DVDs...which is preferred for me.  It saves space on my DVD shelf.
Great videos. :)",1307491200,4,486,4.285714285714286
3628727,3,B001HAO8NM,"I guess I should have believed the title ""For beginners"".  This is extremely basic yoga.  Most of one of the p.m. yoga routines is just laying on your back!!  Not what I was expecting.  I guess I need to learn what types of yoga I'm looking for before investing in a DVD set.  I've only done yoga once before, but was expecting more than ""lay on your back and breath"".

They also just sort of splice different cuts of video together to make a ""routine"", not just one full routine.

Also, the picture of the DVD set is wrong.  They do stack the DVDs one on top of the other in ONE flimsy case.  Pretty cheap and not convenient at all.",1307232000,7,633,4.1652892561983474
3628728,5,B001HAO8NM,"Great value! These DVDs have a great variety offering varying intensity and program length. There are programs starting at 15 minutes, which is fantastic for a quick pickup.

Although the videos are much different than actually being in class (I always really appreciated the one-on-one feedback on proper posture) they did a great job of creating a relaxed atmosphere and explaining how to preform each pose. With three DVDs included, there are workouts designed for almost every purpose. For me, these are great videos for yoga beginners.",1306627200,2,482,4.962962962962963

3628731,4,B001HAO8NM,"Great price for the amount of workouts you get with this. I started doing yoga in January through a class at school, and although I loved it, it's an expensive hobby. I decided to purchase this video to practice at home. The 3 DVD's provide a great variety (length of time, difficulty, purpose, etc), which means we're never doing the same routine over and over. I really enjoyed the few I have done so far. I took a power yoga class and was used to the intensity and pace of that type of workout, which this package doesn't have. But it's still a great set!",1306454400,,558,4.3238095238095235

You will get better and better. I expect to be proficient in about 10 years. (Smile). But I'm an old fart and it is kind of hard to get some of the positions, so I modify to suit my body. I like to exercise with my Great-Granddaughter. She shows me up and I still have fun.

This is something parents can do along with their children. It's fun, inexpensive, it will definitely calm everyone down and the best part is it will make you closer to each other. So have fun and enjoy.",1303689600,,648,3.9846153846153847

Essential Yoga For Inflexible People, a starter DVD with some remedial movements, Yoga For Stress Relief, targeted more specifically to backaches, headaches and other things that may make you feel bad and AM/PM Yoga, which is a more general video with a good selection of things in terms of time that work very well for morning or evening yoga.

Overall nicely done and very useful.",1299888000,,621,4.585585585585585
3628738,4,B001HAO8NM,"This three disc set gives enough variety to get started. Honestly I was sold on the endorsement from the Dalai Lama (I'm a sucker for eastern philosophy). I'm new to yoga and still feel a bit goofy but the videos weren't as cheesy as most others I've found. They do use some odd phrasing but it's not hard to figure out what they mean. The actual workout definitely works. Muscles are stretched, breathing becomes increased and rhythmic, it's all been effective and comfortable enough that I'm happy to start up the video every morning. Personally, for me, this is a great intro before signing up for an actual class.

I did remove one star for the case itself (considering the product as complete package). The image shown is a box set but I received a single DVD case that holds all three discs on one side. It's a pain to constantly unsnap/resnap all three from one holder to find the disc I'm looking for. Sticking with the box set and using three slim cases or an eco-friendly case would have been much more desirable because it's obviously just to cut production cost. Again, this isn't reflective of the video itself, just the packaging.",1299888000,9,1144,4.635467980295567

There is one that is for those who are very new and need some more help (inflexible) and the other two pick up where the inflexible leaves off, though they also have enough easier material and clear instruction that I was able to work with them also even befor being fully done with the first one.  Good value.",1299715200,,366,4.2898550724637685
3628741,3,B001HAO8NM,I have never done yoga before except on my Wii fit.  I got these dvd's for the winter because it is really hard to get out and exercise in the Winter where I live.  The disks did not arrive as the picture states.  There were 3 disks all piled on top of each other in one dvd box.  I was really disappointed.  As for the disks themselves.  I found it was a great stretching routine but was a little too fast for me.  It tells you to lay on the floor where you can not see the tv screen and starts going through all of these different poses.  The more you watch it the more you get the hang of things but for a beginner dvd I would have thought they would teach you the poses first then go into a routine.,1298678400,2,703,3.9014084507042255
3628742,5,B001HAO8NM,I love that this DVD gives you so many options. It is clever how poses are recorded individually and then spliced to give different types of workouts. It is very well thought out. At the beginning I missed not having a graceful transitions shown between each set of poses but as I became familiar with the routine that was no longer a problem. I like the flow that is given.,1297036800,8,374,4.357142857142857
3628743,5,B001HAO8NM,"This is a very complete beginner yoga set.  I have nothing to speak of for flexibility and couldn't do most of the ""beginner"" yoga I tried.  This set caught my interest with the Inflexible program. Though some parts seem easy, but let me tell you if you really have limited/no flexibility or want a good place to start, this is your chance to start yoga and actually get something more then frustration out of it.  3 times a week for a month and I'm starting to rely on the chair less.  It feels good.  It's nice to know that once I get over this first hurdle I still have 2 more DVDs to work on.",1296604800,12,596,4.147826086956521

The sequences were so split up that relaxation was hard to accomplish if not impossible.

I was also surprised at how much REPEATED FOOTAGE is on each DVD. Don't pay for the same footage arranged into different sequences!!! It is as if they shot all the poses and then cut and pasted each pose into a choppy routine. I would've liked better to have seen one instructor go through a ""workout"" all at once.

The image is of three DVDs in their own cases, but the item I received was one DVD case with all three DVDs in it.",1294099200,29,672,4.153846153846154

I got it mainly for the stress relief, although I believe my husband will very much benefit from the DVD for inflexible people. I was already familiar with yoga, having done classes before I was pregnant, but couldn't continue afterwards. I just started getting back into it and this will be a very nice way to get some gentle exercise without injuring myself. The woman does a good job, but I love the background.

If you are really inflexible, that one is fantastic.  It's very remedial and just what I needed.  Maggie really knows what she's doing.  Using a chair has finally made yoga something I can actually do and benefit from.  Every week I'm relying on it less.  Eventually I'll move up to the regular Beginner DVD in the box.

The Inflexible title has routines that range from 5 to 10 minutes to up to around an hour or so (for use as you get better/stronger) and includes ways of making things earlier as you learn.

The Stress Relief has a TON of poses and workouts to help you target problem areas, such as headaches, and is very good and effective.

The AM PM focuses more on things to help you energize and relax.  The teachers provide enough verbal cues and reminders on positioning and breathing so that I feel that I am really learning how to do things properly at a good pace.

For someone who is only interested in the routines, I would delete the Dalai Lama's talk on meditation, not really needed for intense yoga practice.

2nd DVD titled ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" does not focus on too many yoga moves - the titled selections don't indicate a break in the supposed 20+ routines - also too much intro of ""ocean waves"" - In proper yoga techniques the instructor (in background) should be saying ""inhale"" and ""exhale"" not breath in and out, otherwise after trying the moves, I agree the routines for stress do work, with the exception of being too much pressure on the back of the neck.

Last DVD titled ""Essential Yoga for Inflexible people"" has an unbeleivably long routine which went past an hour - didn't really see any break in this routine, can get tiring after a while holding some of the poses for too long. Otherwise the content is good and acceptable. Instructor takes too many breaks in explanations, needs an easier and lighter flow to her narration.
