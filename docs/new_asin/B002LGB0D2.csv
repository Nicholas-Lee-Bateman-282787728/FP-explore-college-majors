3947822,1,B002LGB0D2,"Poor acting, direction, etc. are not necessarily qualities that will kill a movie...completely...I mean, corpse burned...charred and ashes shot into space; but when a movie dwells too long in the inane without the slightest attempt to wink at the audience and say, ""We know it's bad and it's meant to be this way.""  Well, there's the problem with this movie.",1389139200,2,358,4.966666666666667

3947825,2,B002LGB0D2,"Two inept biogeneticists in New Mexico stumble upon a formula that appears to discourage sexual activity among lab rats, providing hope it can be used to curtail rat populations in urban areas.  But our country's simple-minded, religious zealot President at the time, desperately searching for anything to help his popularity rating, hears of it first, and decides to use the untested formula to curtail premarital sex among young people.  He rushes the formula out to the general population, before the inventors determine a rather serious side effect: it turns straight people gay, and gay people straight.  Uh, oh.

I really wanted to like this film, figuring a clever satire on this subject, in capable hands, could be both entertaining and enlightening for many people.  Unfortunately, this attempt falls far short of that, and - in my opinion - is remarkable only in the sense that it surpasses ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" as the worst gay themed film of the past decade.

I realize this is a low budget film, with inexperienced actors, and I don't fault them for that.  However, the whole thing gives the impression it was shot over a long weekend, with much of the dialogue adlibbed to a cartoonish extreme. There is an ongoing bit with reports from ""Fax"" (parody of Fox) News, detailing the results of the formula's mayhem, which was clever the first couple of times it was used, but soon became tedious and overdone. The mostly straight characters became complete stereotypes, once they were ""turned gay,"" and the resulting persecution of heterosexuals (now a minority; a bill is introduced to make heterosexual marriage illegal) could be seen as a justification for discrimination against gays in our real world. At best, the film lets straight viewers with a slight homophobic bent falsely feel like they are being open-minded.

DVD has extensive extras, including auditions, table reads, director commentary and stills.  I can't give any more than two stars out of five.",1257465600,4,1993,5.033434650455927

3947844,1,B002LGB0D2,"I actually watched it.  I wanted to give you an ""informed"" review so I watched it to the end.  Scene one made me think that someone was inspired by The Onion movie and went right out to film this without a script, or writers, or thinking about it, or thinking, or anything.  The pro homosexual / anti Bush / anti religion theme might have been purposely overdone for added humor, but really, it stopped on the doorstep of insulting.  If it had been funny, okay.  But it wasn't.  The only enjoyment I got fm this movie was writing this.",1395705600,4,535,4.353535353535354

Since the war is impossible to win without chemical assistance, he uses a partially tested anti-sex chemical to make everyone ""chaste"".  Unfortunately it makes everyone change sexuality from either hetero to gay or the opposite.  The ideas are fun and worth the time now with the legitimizing of homosexual relationships.",1391040000,,456,5.291666666666667
