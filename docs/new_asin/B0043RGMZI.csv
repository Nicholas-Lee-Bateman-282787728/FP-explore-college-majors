4257307,5,B0043RGMZI,"Many dancers are faced with the question how to really dance instead of just performing a sequence of technical elements. This instructional DVD starring Alimah and produced by Michelle Joyce addresses that question by showing how to add intention and emotion to the movements.

The DVD consists of three parts - concepts, combinations that will later form a choreography, and bonus performances. The concepts' section consists of 16 short chapters concentrating on some more obvious topics like breath, hands, level changes etc., but some also carrying more intriguing titles like Zippers, Bowling Balls and Leaving the Spine. Alimah uses a lot of comparisons to explain the meaning behing the movements. You won't hear any worn-out explanations on this DVD, instead she is being very creative with descriptions for example Champagne Bubble Shimmy, Honey and Peanut Butter Texture, and School of Fish Hands. Having a musical background Alimah also draws a lot of parallels between dancing and music - at some point she even brings out a violin and plays it to demonstrate the different textures of expression. The concepts' section also includes three fun creativity exercises to help you to give different flavours to your dancing. Most of the concepts' section is not something you can dance along to - instead it gives you ideas to use when dancing and designing your practice sessions.

The concepts are concluded by the Flow, where Alimah goes through most of the Concepts to music. It is a rather fast-paced exercise, so it might take you a few times before you can really follow it. To make it easier the titles of concepts are displayed at the bottom of the screen accordingly.

In the next section of the DVD Alimah teaches eight combinations. Each combination has been given a name to characterise it - for example Greet the Dawn for a smooth and stretching combination and  Time Travellers for marking floor patterns. Each combination is first broken down, then a walk-through of the combination is provided before practicing it to music. The combinations are rather long, however they are well explained.

The combinations come together into a choreography. In the walk-through Alimah explains the order of combinations, and the names of the combinations are provided at the bottom of the screen to help along. However, when it comes to practising the choreography this aid is not given. The choreography contains a small part where you can experiment yourself. At the end Alimah will perform the choreography in a costume.

The bonus performances show Alimah dancing to three different pieces. Although Alimah is a beautiful dance it is difficult to watch the performances due to the rather monotone music. At moments I was caught thinking that she is dancing to different music, which has been dubbed over for the DVD.

As for the practical side the DVD is produced in a simple but good manner. Alimah's movements are visible against the light backgrounds and the combinations are filmed in front of a mirror, which makes it easy to follow.  Occasionally there are minor mechanical noises that are caused by Alimah's microphone, but it does not disturb the watching of the DVD.

I would definitely recommend that DVD to intermediate and advanced dancers who want to add some emotion into their dancing without the threat of over-acting. The running time of the DVD is over two hours and it will keep you busy for a much longer time. It is not one of those DVDs which you can just put on and bop along to. This DVD demands your attention and effort and you will get to work with it for quite some time.

Disclosure: I received the DVD as a gift from Cheekygirls Productions",1293926400,20,3687,4.941841680129241
4257308,5,B0043RGMZI,"This was the 2nd belly dance dvd that I received, and I have to say I was not disappointed. I consider myself an intermediate bellydancer and I learned a great deal from this dvd. Alimah shows graceful hand gestures, to visualizing movements it is a wonderful tool that can be very helpful for beginners and anyone else to extend there practice.",1290729600,7,345,4.672131147540983
4257309,5,B0043RGMZI,"I love Cheeky Girls and buy all of their productions. I don't always review dvds, but I thought I needed to on this one. The dvd is extensive and full of illustrations and helpful tools to help bring your belly dance to life. I would describe the dvd as the ""icing on the cake"" if you are already an accomplished dancer that will add that special something. It is unique in that a beginner can also take away a ton of good tips. It also has a complete choreography which I didn't expect. Alimah is very intelligent, artistic, and articulate which translates into a very unique teaching style that I found very refreshing and easy to understand. She uses a lot of mental imagery, adjectives, illustrations, and creative comparisons (and more unique ways of teaching) which somehow magically cause the learner to absorb the material much quicker. Some dancers are great dancers, but may not be gifted teachers. However, she is both a wonderful dancer and gifted teacher! I think this is one of those rare dvd's that will dramatically help me grow tremendously in my dance. This dvd will impact your dance too, I promise!",1288569600,18,1118,4.709183673469388

8415188,3,B0043RGMZI,"I love her performance and dance style, but this DVD wasn't meet my expectation.
From this DVD, I was expected learn Expression as description says "" emotion behind their movements"", Musicality, but couldn't find those information. Disappointing, but I still can use for practice.",1471564800,,280,5.386363636363637
8415189,3,B0043RGMZI,"I'm not sure I knew what I was buying when I bought this one. I was kind of expecting a class in musicality and musical interpretation, but it's pretty much a choreography with meanings given to the movements she's chosen for the choreography. I'm an improvisational dancer, so I don't find choreography DVDs particularly useful. It would be good for someone looking for a choreography with extended combination drills, though. I can't say I'll be doing much with it, as it doesn't much suit my purposes.",1437004800,,504,4.872093023255814

8415191,5,B0043RGMZI,I really like the concept behind Alimah's DVD. She is a musician and a dancer so she really knows how to accentuate the phrasing to emote with with music. I use her suggestions when preparing for performances. I would recommend this disc to any dancer who wants to flow more and really embody their music when they move.,1397174400,,320,4.5344827586206895
8415192,1,B0043RGMZI,"I asked for this video for Christmas last year hoping that it might help me push my bellydance to the next level, and push it does...in a very disappointing way.

Like the instructor, I, too, have a LOT of musical training and a LOT of dance training, but nothing prepared me for the half finished moves and completely willy-nilly feel of the dance being taught-one whirlwind combo at a time-in this video.

I knew going in that this video was for a more Turkish/Romany style of dance than the Gothic/Tribal Fusion I've been dancing.  Read: I knew it would be faster and would likely require me to throw my hair and hips around like they weren't really part of my body. What I didn't expect was four count shoulder shimmies at 164 beats per minutes followed immediately by giant hip swings and then turns and kicks, with absolutely no logical transitions between any of the moves. Being the type of dancer who really likes to complete a phrase before I move to the next one, I found the choreography difficult to watch, and nearly impossible to learn.

The overview section is slightly more helpful, but the instructor fails to give what you're learning in this section any meaning.  As an instructor myself, there's nothing I dislike more than finding myself in a situation where what I'm teaching has absolutely no context for the learner.  If you're really interested in teaching me musicality, explain where these moves make sense inside a choreography. Demo them with a short piece of music (of appropriate tempo, of course) so that I can see how I can use them to enhance my dance repertoire.  Don't just tell me to take inspiration from my daily life. My daily life is a lot of caffeine, car pooling, and office politicking; there's no room for miming picking roses, drawing magic from the ground, or throwing a flowy veil into the air there. I take dance classes for that.

The combo instruction is simply too fast.  The teacher is assuming that the only people who are buying her video are folks who have been dancing Turkish/Romany for years.  The instructor's idea of a 'walk through' is more like a sprint, she gives no explanation of the mechanics of any of the moves she uses (see above about assumptions) and/or explanation of why she chose those particular moves and how they work with the musical phrases.  Again confirming that she totally missed the mark.  Dancers interested in learning how enhance the musicality of their dance will not learn that in this video.

All in all, it's disappointing. If you're wanting to learn to enhance the musicality of your movements, look elsewhere first.",1372723200,,2610,4.747787610619469
8415193,5,B0043RGMZI,"I liked this video and have viewed it a number of times. Alimah, the instructor, does not so much teach ""moves"" or ""combinations"" as concepts, though I picked up a number of movements that added to my movement vocabulary. I very much liked the conceptual basis for this video. She shows the same dance with different meanings or intentions, and also has a follow along section that I really liked. The material is not strictly traditional belly dance; she does bring in some modern and lyrical dance concepts.",1369958400,,509,4.795454545454546
8415194,5,B0043RGMZI,Very useful DVD for anyone interested in developing their dance. Good for a beginner or someone more advanced. The progression of showing the different movements and the ideas they are generated from is easy to follow and makes sense. I first listened to it while wrapping presents and didn't really dance to it. However It's something that you can not resist getting up to try. So I stepped on a few boxes! The names for some of the moves might seem silly at first but the mental imagery that goes along with them means they make sense and you won't forget them. I really like this DVD and I have been dancing for about 6 years.,1324944000,,629,4.431034482758621
8415195,3,B0043RGMZI,"I think what i love most about this video is that the teacher is a wonderful conceptual artist. She brings imagination and freedom to the dance. This video is wonderful for any level of dancer who wants a different perspective or needs a pathway to freedom. If you are coming out of basic belly dance movements, i think this video would make a wonderful transition from drilling to dancing. I like the way this teacher explains things. I liked the choreography but hated the song, which made it hard for me to want to keep trying the choreography. Other than that, i think this video is great for beggining to intermediate dancers or for any dancer who wants a fresh perspective on movement. Very nice.",1308182400,2,702,4.624
8415196,4,B0043RGMZI,"I really liked this DVD.  At over 2 hours long, it has a lot of material and can appeal to different levels of dancers.  While it seems to be aimed at the intermediate-to-advanced dancer/performer, the Concepts section would be useful even for new dancers, because you can apply the ideas of texture and nuance even to a simple hip circle.

The first time I put it in, I watched the entire Concepts section.  I had so many ideas on how to improve my dance, and my next improvisational dance sessions, I felt, were some of my best, most expressive dancing ever.  It reminded me very much of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improvisation-Toolkit-Volume-1-Movement-Recall/dp/B001NMT8FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improvisation Toolkit Volume 1: Movement Recall</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improvisation-Toolkit-Volume-2-Structure/dp/B003DKJFJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improvisation Toolkit Volume 2: Structure</a>, but not such that the material is duplicated.  No, it is more that, if you are looking to make yourself a unique dancer, all of these DVDs will come in handy.  Actually, for that matter, also check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Combin-ography-Bridging-the-gap-between-choreography-and-improvisation-belly-dance/dp/B002PJ8290/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Combin-ography - Bridging the gap between choreography and improvisation - belly dance</a>.

I also watched Alimah's beautiful dance performances.  She is an incredibly expressive dancer with her very own style.

Later, I tried the combinations.  The combinations build up to a choreography, also performed by Alimah on this DVD, to a new-age fusion style of music with a lot of dynamic changes.  The combinations illustrate all of the concepts.  On one hand, it is useful to see the concepts applied.  On the other hand, if one's  brains is focusing on taking in the movements, it's hard to remember that the point is to learn about the application of the concepts.  While sometimes Alimah used Egyptian-style movements that I'm deeply familiar with, she also used a lot of ballet and Western-influenced movements that, for me, were quite challenging to pick up quickly.  Luckily there are two walkthroughs and several practice runs with music.

For now, I will not be returning to these combinations for a while - but now I know what I need to work on - turns, directional changes, and more balletic movements - always a challenge for me.  It will be interesting to keep them as a challenge and return to them every once and a while to see how I am progressing. However, I will be re-watching the Concepts section again soon for inspirations on creating my next choreography.  Overall, this DVD is a keeper - I was very inspired by what I found inside!",1296000000,5,2873,5.9609756097560975
