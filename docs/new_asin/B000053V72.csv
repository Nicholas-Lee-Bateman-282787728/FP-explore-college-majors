1389979,5,B000053V72,"I was in the process of reading the Shadow Divers and came accrosed the Nova DVD ""Hitler's Lost Sub"". This is an excellent account of the book version of the story. It was very informative to view, almost as being there, the persise story of the book I was reading, on film. How, Why and Where the Nazi War effort came so close to our homeland and what could have happened. The book is more detailed, but to actually see the side by side comparison of reading the story was very fasinating and enjoyable.",1140825600,17,504,4.372340425531915
1389980,5,B000053V72,"The accolades 'remarkable'. 'superb', 'astounding' etc. are so easily over-used, but in the case of this film, they all apply.

This really is a documentary of the highest standard. The details are historically accurate; the commentary is informative and lacks all the traces of 'gung-ho' or exaggeration that can so easily affect documentaries about dangerous exploration. The structure of the film is near perfect .... starting with the existence of a mystery U-Boat sunk over 200 feet beneath the waves off the eastern coast of America. As the genuinely exciting (and tragic) story of the dive is told, the entire history of modern submarine warfare is covered right up to May 1945. This goes back to the first boats such as 'the Turtle' and then moves forward through WW1 and WW2 and even includes film of the Walter and Type 21 U-Boats.

Everything is stitched together seamlessly and, by the end of the film, includes some really emotionally-charged scenes and interviews with relatives of those who died on the boat, or those who sailed in U-Boats during the war.

The standard of filming is first class. This includes the use of excellent archive film, simulated events and effective animation.

I cannot praise this film too highly. If you pair it with, say, 'Das Boot', you will gain a truly incredible insight into the realities of the submarine war - and the bravery of both the submariners and the diving team who uncovered the story of this mystery boat.",1139270400,10,1468,4.907258064516129

1389982,5,B000053V72,"This two hour DVD traces the history of submersibles through WWII and details the dramatic U-Boat campaign off the US.

It follows the story of wreck divers Ritchie Kohler and John Chatterton as they spend years identifying the wreck of a German U-Boat they were put onto by Capt. Bill Nagle of the dive boat ""Seeker"". Three divers, including a father and son team, were lost in this quest.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Divers-The-True-Adventure-of-Two-Americans-Who-Risked-Everything-to-Solve-One-of-the-Last-Mysteries-of-World-War-II/dp/0345482476/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II</a>

It travels from archives in the US to Germany where poignant stories of the U-869's crew are revealed.

A nice tour takes the viewer through a Type 9 U-Boat in a museum. The video also has some amazing high quality underwater footage taken by veteran wreck diver Bill Delmonico. This footage of the U-869 in spectacularly clear water conditions was shot long before the submarine wreck was actually identified. Strangely, Mr. Delmonico does not receive an artist's credit for this work.

As a wreck diver and charter boat skipper who has dived on U-Boat and other submarine wrecks for many years this video was doubly interesting to me. It should fascinate any diver or historian. Really does bring out enough stuff to scare you.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Dive-A-Father-and-Son-s-Fatal-Descent-into-the-Ocean-s-Depths/dp/0060932597/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Dive: A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths</a>

1389983,5,B000053V72,I have been a diver for years and shipwrecks have always interested me.  I have read many books on shipwrecks and a few on the U-869 (The Last Dive by Bernie Chowdhury and Robert Kurson's shadow divers.)  This DVD really put into perspective the detail both authors put into thier books.  The underwater footage of the U-869 is incredible!,1109635200,10,339,4.711864406779661
1389984,5,B000053V72,"This video is impressive stuff. Even better if you firts read ""Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II by  Robert Kurson"" that describes this whole adventure in its many diferents facets in a very grasping way so to say. You'll never put the book down, and afterwards you'll be wanting to now more. Well this video gives you more.

The only thing that I missed in the book were some graphics to give us non divers a real sense of what the U-boat looks like down there, you'll get the full picture in this video. You'll see just how crazy Chaterton is to go through that tiny hole just to get that one artifact he needs to positively identify the u-boat. You'll also see hoy very little visibility they have.

Highly recomended!

Remember however the director of the film is telling the viewer ""A Truth"" but not necessarily ""The Truth."" In this case however the Truth develops right before our eyes as the film progresses.  There is also great loss & sadness attached to the story and actually also develops during the filming of the docu.  The crews  quest to find the number of the U-Boat develops higher and higher as each minute passes and the historical records that exist have no info or bearing on where the boat is actually geographically located. There is tragic loss of life trips to Germany to visit the U-Boat Historical Document Museum to check double check and triple check the historical documents that already exist. There is drama suspense excitement sadness and so many more moments of emotional excitement. One of the very best for sure. PS Comma key no longer works.",1410825600,,950,4.851851851851852

1390034,5,B000053V72,"This presentation is a lot more than just dry facts. It's more than some weird speculation like ""did aliens bump off Hitler's sub?""

 In 1991 a fisherman caught is net on something 60 miles off the shore of New Jersey. It turns out to be the remains of a German U-boat from December 1941. Now Nova takes us on a six year quest of discovery as we endeavor to find the name number of the boat and its story.

Some presenters:
Horst von Schroeter (Watch Officer of U-123)
Erich Topp (commander of U-552)
Gordon Vaeth (U Navy Air Intelligence, Airships)
Bernard Cavalcante (US Naval Historical Center)
Richard Kohler (diver)
Author Burk (Engineer, Naval Torpedo Station)
Clay Blair (Historian)
Gary Weir (US Naval Historical Center)
Timothy Mulligan (German Naval Historian)
John Chatterton (Diver)
Werner Rahn (Historian. German Navy (Ret'd))
Dean Allard (US Naval History Center)
John Yurga (diver)

This is a very well presented mystery. A real plus in this presentation is that it is in soundbite form but so well assembled that you do not notice. We get interviews from people who are alive at the time the missing sub missing, relatives of the missing people, and experts on the subject. There are a few spots where you would want them to just hurry up and get on with it; then you realize that this is a two hour presentation. Another benefit from this production is the history lessons. Many people know the history in general but it becomes more personal as you find out the actual details and find yourself saying ""why didn't anybody tell me that before?""",1396656000,,1561,4.79182156133829
1390045,5,B000053V72,"This is a retelling of the story in the book ""Shadow "" divers. It leaves out a lot of the detail covered in the book. The book gives a

1390046,5,B000053V72,"The movie documentation to the book Shadow Divers.

1390047,4,B000053V72,"Before I saw this on Public Television, I didn't know that German U-boats had actually gotten to the United States coastline. I heard stories but never really believed them. This outstanding episode made a believer out of me.",1381795200,,225,4.947368421052632
1390048,5,B000053V72,"I began this mystery by listening to Robert Kurson's novel ""Shadow Divers.""  I then searched the internet, specifically, the German Naval Archives.  I also consulted Gary Gentile's book ""Shadow Divers Exposed.""  Finally, I purchased the Nova program ""Hitler's Lost Sub.""  These four sources gave four views, with and without agreement.

The Nova program is excellent; for me, it summarizes much of the other sources with an important difference.  That difference is the visual aspect which for me is a major element of modern society.  For most people today visualization is crucial to even arouse interest!

I recommend this video without qualification!

John Chatterton is a total man with his perfect code of ethics, his raw courage & experience, his class 'A' intelligence and heroic handsome features.  Richie Koehler originally hung with a band of bad boys and had a major problem at home, as well.  However, Chatterton knew and valued his abilities, raw courage and superb  knowledge, so he went to work to get him on the right side of history with himself.  John & Richie have created one of the richest stories of modern times; and, by doing it have solved one of the last persistent mysteries of WWII.  (Add to this the amazingly nail-biting writing style of Robert Kurson from the original book, and you have a story for the ages.)  It further contains the sorrowful father & son tragedy which also happened for real.

Nova recognized how good a program this would be and retold not only the story of the scuba divers and the efforts to identify the U Boat, but also of the U Boat war in the Atlantic Ocean in WW2. There are many surprises even to one who has read the book.

The book leaves you with the impression you could barely see in front of your face, so however the divers did it, the quality of the underwater footage is fantastic. Nova does mention how dangerous it is for scuba divers to go this far (230 feet) underwater, but the book is better at capturing the fear and hazards than the DVD.

The DVD, however, really gives a very good overview of the U Boat war, the development of radar, sonar, early sucesses of the U Boats and how later the Allies were able to sink 70% of all German submarines. The Germans managed to sink only 1% of Allied shipping during the war. There is a lot of orginal WW2 footage of submarines, attacks on convoys, attacks on subs.

1390088,5,B000053V72,"""Hitler's Lost Sub"" is one of the best ""Nova"" productions in history. The episode traces the quest to determine the identity of a German U-Boat that had been sunk off the coast of the US during World War Two, and was heretofore completely unknown.

The documentary details the history of the German underwater boat program, and introduces the viewers to the perils of deep water diving. (Three divers died on this wreck.) The principal divers profiled are veterans John Chatterton and Richie Kohler who explain their methodical plans for exploring the wreck to determine the identity of the U-Boat. Both divers took extreme care not to disturb human remains (which were plentiful) although doing so would have likely lead them to a much quicker wreck identification, as personal artifacts commingled with the remains are often the easiest to trace.

The question of which U-Boat it is turns out to be extraordinarily difficult to answer, and ultimately requires the divers, and particularly Chatterton to take extraordinary risks to answer the question. Eventually the wreck turns out to be U-869, supposedly sunk off North Africa, though in fact it is very close to New Jersey. The divers research the chain of events that lead the U-869 to a place neither the Germans nor the allies knew it was. Also expounded on is the most likely methodology of the sinking, although the documentary makes clear that in some people's minds the exact cause of the U-869's death is still in question.

This episode of ""Nova"" is superb both in compelling storytelling and in technical explanations, and I was particularly impressed with the sensitive handling of interviews of relatives of the U-869 crew. I was even more impressed that the divers took it on themselves to personally contact the families and inform them of the fate of their loved ones, a fate that they had not known since World War Two.

I recommend that viewers read the fine book ""Shadow Divers"" by Robert Kurson, which is equally gripping and covers this material in greater detail, preferably prior to watching the documentary. This is an example of what documentary films should be, and I recommend it to everyone.",1242086400,,2173,4.977961432506887

1390103,5,B000053V72,"This is a very well prepared and documented real life account behind the story from the book, Shadow Divers.  If you've read the book, you'll be intriqued by how this DVD correlates to some of the story line in the book.  But beyond the comparison to Shadow Divers, this DVD details the events leading up to the verification by John Chatterton and Richie Kohler of the wreck of the U-869 and what happens after this fact is made known.

This documentary not only presents the events involved with diving to the U-869 but also mixes in the history of this sub and the circumstances leading up to its ultimate demise.  It also gives personal glimpses about its crew and the families that were left behind.

Whether you're a scuba diver, a Shadow Divers fan, or a U-boat history buff, you'll thoroughly enjoy this documentary.  I know I was.",1197504000,,838,4.628378378378378
1390104,5,B000053V72,"Having read Bernie Chowdhury's Last Dive and Robert Kurson's Shadow Divers, I came across this wonderful video by accident, but have watched it multiple times.

Not only an in-depth history of submarines and the U-Boats' role in World War I and the Atlantic War of 1939-45, the historical context comes against the backdrop of the mystery U-Boat found of the New Jersey coast in 1991, and the subsequent efforts of expert divers to uncover its identity (unfortunately at the cost of three experienced adventurers).

I can't say enough about how well done and moving this film is- especially at the end, when the divers meet with the sister of one of the lost crewmen. This is documentary filmmaking at its finest.

It's got all the invaluable and intriguing minutia that most of us have come to love about Nova documentaries in general. Before seeing this episode I had no idea that the first underwater ship was created in the 1700s and the way in which underseas boats captured the imagination of people in the 19th century. The show, in fact, is more of a modern tale than anything else. It explores the mystery of a lost sub off the coast of New Jersey and the travails of a group of divers on a quest to determine its exact identity. It reminded me of an aquatic version of a CSI plot.",1175990400,6,771,4.475177304964539

I felt this DVD gave much additional information and was an excellent ""add-on"". The parts that must have been recreated chronologically I thought were also well done. They justified my purchase having read the book. I did wonder whether a final explanatory

appendix might have been added following the release of information about ""Enigma"". The dangers of deep Scuba diving despite using gas mixes were well described, and I thought the DVD was excellent.
