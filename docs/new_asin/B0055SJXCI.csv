4580853,3,B0055SJXCI,Nothing to really brag about; it was entertaining. I would have enjoyed the 2012 Disaster Movies better if they weren't so preachy.,1363910400,,131,5.0
4580854,3,B0055SJXCI,"For those of us who like ""B"" movies this was a good 6 pack. A couple of the movies were very preachy, but I guess that goes with the times.",1361923200,,139,3.6666666666666665
4580855,5,B0055SJXCI,"Very interesting movies which I didn't mind buying as I like action and these I haven't seen before, All different and not classed as A grade but close. Plenty of action in all of them very watchable and with the mixed group there is something for everyone, The effects are marvelous and the presentation by the actors and cast are great making you get interested so much that you don't won't to move in case you miss something, All the movies are on the go from start to finish. Never a dull moment so much happening  I can't tell you everything so that's it for now. Don't want to spoil it for you. So another night relaxing and eating my munchies, feet up enjoying fantastic entertainment, what more do I need. So see for yourself and be your own judge. I don't think you will be disappointed,  Enjoy!",1360972800,2,804,4.425675675675675

4580857,1,B0055SJXCI,My son likes extreme weather and was excited to get this movie pack.  Even he thought the movies were terrible (he is 8).  Obviously low budget movies.  I guess you get what you pay for (it was like $5).,1359936000,,203,4.153846153846154
