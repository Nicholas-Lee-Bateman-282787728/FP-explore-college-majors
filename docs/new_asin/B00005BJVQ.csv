4069931,5,B00005BJVQ,"Directed and co-scripted by JOHN HUSTON. Narrated by WALTER HUSTON. World War II was a good war, fought by good and patriotic Americans. Unlike fictional Vietnam veterans, the G.I.s of World War II were rarely shown to be anything less than psychologically fit. This celebrated and heartrending documentary vividly shows how not all World War II vets remained untouched by their combat experiences. In fact, the viewer is informed at the outset that ""about 20 percent of all battle casualties in the American Army during World War II were of a neuropsychiatric nature."" The setting is a military hospital, where a group of troubled G.I.s are being psychologically evaluated and treated. They are described as ""human salvage"" and ""casualties of the spirit,"" and the film is especially moving as the various men are observed up close. One cannot walk. Another stutters. A third suffers from amnesia. A fourth constantly and nervously shakes his head. All were raised during peacetime and taught to abhor war, but found themselves thrust into terrible situations where the fulfillment of their duties required them to kill other human beings. The film was shot by Hollywood legend John Huston using hidden cameras; during the war Huston had served in the Signal Corps and made several government-sponsored documentaries. This was originally meant to be seen by the general public, however, its content proved to be much too potent and, as such, the film was banned for decades. 58 minutes.",1182816000,5,1486,5.144628099173554
4069932,4,B00005BJVQ,Excellent presentation of psychiatric problems of WWII veterans and psychiatric care of the time.  This movie was suppressed by the government at the insistence of the military until released during the Viet Nam War era.  This suppression delayed our gaining understanding of post traumatic stress by a generation.,1437782400,,314,5.520833333333333
4069933,4,B00005BJVQ,"A very moving look at PTSD (before the term was commonly used) experienced returning WWII veterans, and the 1940s-era therapies used to return them successfully to civilian life. For those used to the freedom and flexibility of modern documentary techniques, some scenes can appear stagy,but the power of the interviews and therapy sessions are undeniable.  Although the film was made to convince Americans that emotionally affected vets are ""curable,"" and offers an upbeat ending, public screenings were banned until the 1980s.  Since then, ""Let Their Be Light"" hasn't received wide distribution, but to me it is certainly one of the most important American documentaries to emerge from the World War II era, and perhaps in all of documentary film history.",1418688000,,757,5.3
4069934,5,B00005BJVQ,"Amazing work by Huston will humble your heart as you watch these real soldiers--not actors--work through what we now call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The medical specialists listened to the soldiers, bullied a little bit when necessary and treated them respectfully and honestly. Caring medical professionals used the meager tools of that era helping soldiers understand what happened to them, why they reacted as they did and how to cope with their issues.

I found out about Huston's documentary from a neurologist friend who knew of my interest in history.  He too was impressed by Huston's attention to detail and artistic vision.  Believe it or not, you will be watching a previously censored film here!  After his own viewing, General George Marshall refused to release it  to the public  because he feared public backlash.  Even President Truman did not know about it.

It would be a tremendously useful film for today's public and military to watch, whether they have  PTSD themselves or not. It is an open, honest, caring look at soldiers pushed past their breaking points and how they  found the strength to pull themselves back.

The film was finally released in 1981 and remastered  for modern format, but no effort was made to publicize it.  A word of mouth campaign has finally brought well  deserved attention .  It's a short watch, but really worth your time.  You won't regret it.",1397865600,8,1401,4.974137931034483
4069935,5,B00005BJVQ,"The patients come in shell shocked or what today is called Post Truamatic Stress Disordered PTSD and they leave better functioning battle scarred human beings.  In this movie no veteran goes on to live sad, deluded and half crazy on the streets of the inner city.  Nope the veterans here all readjust and are sent home to loving supportive families and or wives.  the film puts one in mind of The Naked City in its attempt to honestly protray the journey of damaged fighting man back to civilized caring human being.  You walk with the men on their journey seeing medical and mental health doctors (psychiatrists) go through the slow painstaking process of helping battle weary GI's rediscover and reassert their true honorable humanity.

Let There Be Light tries as hard as it can to give you a real world sense of what its like to come back from the hell of war broken as an army of doctors work tirelessly to make you well.  Unfortunately Let There Be Light does not exactly have the ring of truth to it in some cases because; returning good fighting men to sanity is often a long slow painful process frought with setbacks and tears. It is not that Let There Be Light did not try to portray the recovery of men from battle fatique as best it could. Its just the film format means healing times shown had to be compressed so the progress men made overcoming their demons whizzed by like a Henry Ford inspired Moving Assembly line.

Let There Be Light could not take its time and reveal a fighting mans true journey back to sanity and humanity so in places the recoveries were nothing short of spectacular if unreal.  What Let There Be Light  did well is it helps people have understanding and compassion for the fighting man returning from war. Hopefully Let There Be Light will help people understand why veterans of our current wars in Iraq and other places need all of our love, compassion and understanding. Let There Be Light shows us that war is always hell.  War was hell back when this film was made and War is hell today.  Our fighting men deserve every ounce of humane compassion we as individuals and a nation can offer.  This Let There Be Light DVD reminds us in stark terms the price of our freedoms is not FREE!

Many good men and ladies have sacrificed their sanity, humanity and innocence to buy the freedoms so many of us take for granted. Let There Be Light was made in 1946 but its message is as true and vital today in 2014 as it was in 1946.  God Bless those who serve in the US Marines, The Army, The Navy, the Air Force and National Guard for they all sacrifice so much that we might never know the horrors that might haunt them to the end of days. It might be ok to disgree with any war if thats your thing but, no one anywhere has the right to hate our honored and honorable warriors who have answered the call. These men and ladies who serve in our military are our sisters and brothers and I pray Let There Be Light reminds of us this fact.  I sure learned more than a few good lessons from Let There Be Light buy this and see it all for yourself.  This DVD earned my five star rating.",1397606400,3,3115,4.381944444444445

4069938,5,B00005BJVQ,"Film was shot in a hospital in Long Island New York.  When I worked for the Army Pictorial Center we were not permitted to release the film in part because the releases signed by the patients could not be found in the file files.  The real reason was claimed to be that the US Government, at the time, was concerned with public reaction to the film showing soldiers who were ""shell-shocked"".  It is unfortunate that the director of this film, Walter Houston, is no longer with us to see his important work released to the public.",1369440000,10,529,4.489583333333333
4069939,4,B00005BJVQ,"John Huston's Let There Be Light is dated as so many people say, but it remains a fascinating look at how the armed forces tried to rehabilitate emotionally troubled soldiers after World War Two. Sadly, the film was considered so controversial at the time that the government wouldn't let it be released for more than thirty years after it was made! The film shows how badly emotionally scarred some men became as a result of their horrific experiences in combat during the war.

The narration is good and the film does its best to follow four or five men through their roughly eight to ten week stay at a hospital where they are treated for their problems. Diagnostic terms of yesteryear are used along with methods that would be shunned today as too confrontational with doctors practically barking at patients to get them functioning very quickly. The film glosses over the fact that post-traumatic stress disorder can't be cured in eight to ten weeks.

The film also shows how the men were required to participate in sports to bring them out of their shells and to help them interact with people although ""group therapy"" classes are just that--a classroom environment in which the doctor essentially taught them about their illnesses and how to overcome it all with patients only sporadically speaking their minds.

Believe it or not, there's even more in this film that I haven't mentioned and there are many poignant moments. My heart truly went out to these men.

I recommend Let There Be Light for anyone interested in how PTSD was treated back in the mid-20th century; people interested in psychology and psychiatry in general would also do well to add this film to their collections.",1366243200,6,1693,4.8477508650519034

8388682,4,B00005BJVQ,"Very interesting film which points to the fact that PTSD is in no way a new phenomena. The thought is that WW11 veterans who returned home post war were all in one piece psychologically, emotionally etc.- clearly not possible for all the soldiers. This film shows soldiers returned from war with broken psyches and spirits as they pass through the health system, docs trying to help them. This film was banned both by our government and the veterans administration thinking that it would be bad for morale and give an incorrect impression of the army. It was only rereleased in the 1990s. Definitely an interesting and worthwhile view",1467849600,,634,4.87962962962963
