7666838,5,B01BT1W024,"I have been very fortunate to be able to interview Captain Cernan (in 2001) and even better, played golf in the Moonwalker Invitational a group behind him in San Diego (I played with Apollo 9 Cmdr. Jim McDivitt). After our rounds, Gene was a lot of fun to have a beer with and even facilitated me getting dropped off at my motel by his shuttle. He is a truly class act and one of the kindest of the astronauts. This is a wonderful way to experience what it is like to be around him. A fine documentary and a nice compliment to his biography by the same name. There are sad moments, being an astronaut was (and is) hard and dangerous work that demands a lot of time away from family. On the one hand, I hope Gene does take it easy and spend more time in the quiet work on his ranch. But I suspect he wouldn't be happy without at least a bit of contact with people at autograph sessions, etc. Attending one of those events (SpaceFest in San Diego), it seemed kind of weird to me to see people wait in line, swipe their credit cards before getting a few moments to get something signed by the astronauts, have a picture moment, etc. But I am not a space collectibles person either. Just love hearing stories about the guys I grew up watching during the height of the space race. Highly recommend this film!",1456790400,,1303,4.279352226720648
7666839,5,B01BT1W024,"As someone who grew up in the time of Gemini and Apollo in El Lago, Texas (near NASA's MSC), and who knew many of the astronauts, engineers and their families who were directly involved,  ""The Last Man On The Moon"" is clearly the most accurate and reflective film of its kind that I have ever seen. Captures an amazing time and era in Our Country's history, a glimpse at and a sense of the excitement and the spirit of adventure that an entire community of incredibly talented and dedicated people exhibited in the short span of a handful of years, making it all possible.

Truly the Golden Era of Space Exploration. If you want a sense of the amazement and wonder of the time and the people who were involved in the greatest adventure mankind has ever undertaken, this is the documentary to see...",1456790400,15,798,4.534722222222222
7666840,5,B01BT1W024,I saw the preview of this film at Spacefest 2014. I never watched anything so moving and  I've never seen so many watery eye'd folks. This is a must see film that I wish would be shown in every classroom in this country. Too many people have no idea what going to the moon did for this country and what we are throwing away. I urge you to watch this very impressive film.,1456704000,22,371,4.082191780821918
7666841,5,B01BT1W024,"Beautiful true account from the last (but hopefully not the last) astronaut who stood on the moon. It is human, and close and at times hard to watch.

I hope it inspires more people to want for the adventure and pure research and development that comes from space exploration. There is meaning behind pure exploration and learning - somewhere that got lost. We have an obligation to be adventurers. To find and learn and love the universe that we are given.",1456531200,11,457,4.6419753086419755
7666842,4,B01BT1W024,Enjoyed this wonderful film last night.  Unlike many films about NASA that focus on the science and technology this film also told the human story:  the difficult times for family and the loss of friends. For readers of Cernan's memoir it seemed a bit rushed and some things I wanted to see were not there. I talked to the director at the premiere and he promised to include many of these scenes in the video Tennessee's special features or deleted scenes.  The film brought some tears but many smiles and a great deal of pride in what our  country can accomplish when united and when it sets its eyes on a worthy goal.,1456531200,8,619,4.451327433628318

I knew him while I was growing up and often watch my grandpa make cakes to celebrate each missions anniversary.  The film tells his story so well. It shows new generations how important these men were and how important the space program is. I have a copy of his book signed and will treasure it always.

7666871,5,B01BT1W024,It is a contemplative look back on the life of an extraordinary man. At the age of 80 he decided to share it all with us. We are so lucky to get the wisdom of our elders handed down to us. This is more philosophical than action filled. The journey to the moon and the viewing of earth were metaphysical experiences for these 24 great men who went to the moon including the 12 who walked on the moon.,1486684800,,399,4.063291139240507

7666883,3,B01BT1W024,"nicely done...however,  it drags a bit at times but the overall effect is a honest story told by one of the few who have actually been to the moon. I think Cernan gives a candid assessment of the ups and downs of being an astronaut.

7666889,5,B01BT1W024,"I tell everyone to watch this! Very insightful and informative, a more personal look at the lives of these amazing astronauts. I had the pleasure of meeting Gene Cernan about 17 years ago at a Houston charity golf tournament where I volunteered. My then 5 yr old daughter asked him if he believed in space aliens. He gave her the most thoughtful, serious, wonderful answer. He said he hadn't personally seen any aliens when he was in space but he saw such a small part of it. The universe is so vast and there is still so much we don't know; there is definitely the chance that there is life out there and we just may find it one day. Wow. He was so kind and generous with his time and thoughts.
I feel incredibly lucky to have met him & remain forever grateful for that interaction with my child. Back to the film- I watched it with one of my kids then watched it again the next day with another. I'll definitely watch it again, too!",1482192000,,934,4.2824858757062145

7666895,5,B01BT1W024,"What a fabulous movie! Captures the spirit of the time, the resonance of what was achieved, and gives time for reflection - for both Cernan's, and us viewers. An older generation, a slower time - but with much faster toys, and with much more at stake then, than now.
To think that in In 1903 the Wright brothers made their epic first flight, and a mere 66 years later we went to the moon and back!
What have we achieved in the following 50 years? Makes you wonder what went wrong...and what has been lost.",1480464000,2,505,4.326315789473684
7666896,5,B01BT1W024,"In this DVD, we have the story of the American space program from Gemini to Apollo as told by Eugene ""Gene"" Cernan.

The naval aviator who was given the opportunity to join the space program and walked in space and on the moon narrates this video with period film, interviews and the reminiscences of Cernan and others. This is the story of Cernan, his comrades in the space program, their families and the missions they flew.

Cernan has a unique perspective to give since he came in fairly early (the Gemini missions) and stayed in the program until he ended up being the last man to walk on the moon, the last to leave a footprint on the powdery surface of the moon in the Apollo 17 mission. He and the others interviewed in this DVD give us insight into the times, the technology, the personalities and the life of the astronauts.

As I had the privilege to  meet Gene and command module pilot Ron Evans prior to the Apollo17 launch and in 2003 spoke with Gene Cernan again at the EAA AirVenture at Oshkosh, The DVD was of special interest to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

7666900,1,B01BT1W024,"This plays as if it is part of the disinformation campaign to portray space flight as so boring as to be unworthy of interest.  At one point he is sitting back watching his ceiling fan rotate...  Then he appears to drift off to sleep.

Yep, space is a drudge of a bore -- nothing to see here --- no need to wonder about the secret space program; it's gotta be just as banal as this.

7666901,5,B01BT1W024,"A Must See for Space Age fans!

This is about and by, as the title says the last of the 12 humans to walk on the Moon.

I have met Gene Cernan, and he is a passionate man, and it comes across in this.

He has had a lot of tragedy, he was selected for his Gemini mission when the prime crew died when their jet crashed.

He talks bluntly about the cost, in terms of marriage and family life, saying every astronaut missed out on a lot of their marriage and their kids upbringing, and there was nothing one could do, as the competition was so great.

It's sad that we are coming up on fifty years since 1969 and Apollo 11 and that we have not returned to the Moon in all that time.

We need a new JFK sized challenge to return, and that will lead to Mars, as Cernan says.

7666920,5,B01BT1W024,"I have watched many documentaries about the space program, and this is one of the best. It is a very personal story about Gene Ceran, but it tells that story against the greatest adventure that humankind has takenso far. Yes, Cernan has an ego. You would not become an astronaut if you did not think highly of yourself. But it was Muhammad Ali (I think) who said, ""It's not bragging if you can back it up."" The other question examined, if not asked directly, was that after you reach the pinnacle of your life by walking on the moon, what do you do with the rest of your life? There was some very interesting dialog during an off the cuff exchange with a long time friendparticularly poignant for what was not said.

Beyond the biographical aspects of the story, the visuals are simply stunning. They have sought out the best pictures and footage they could find. A surprising amount of it was new to me, a long time consumer of all things related to the space program. Even better, they made an obvious effort to clean up and enhance what they used. Wow!

That guy should should have been kicked out of the astronaut program!
I found he was too full of himself, and a lot of the scenes were just so over-the-top dramatic as to be silly.

It was, however, more about the life and personality of Gene Cernan than about the space program in which he participated. It's like these guys never used any profanity and were squeaky clean, which I know is not true. I think it was a bit more polished than real. Cleaned up rather than being true to life. But it does give a great picture of Gene as a person. If you're a fan, you will want to see this. I thought about purchasing it but wanted to rent it first to see if it was worth it. I enjoyed it when I watched it, but repeat viewings would be somewhat boring in my opinion. Gene is a hero, no doubt.

Of course, our current society is more concerned with sports and reality TV.  We need to get off this rock at some point.  The dinosaurs had no space program.

This film delved into the personal losses of the astronauts themselves which were quite substantial.  Other NASA employees and subcontractors gave just as much time but didn't incur the loss of life.  These Apollo era fliers will soon be gone and then today's science-illiterate populace will question everything that was done and gained.  It's already started with a huge increase in Moon deniers and the resurgence of the flat earthers.  Gene Cernan is one of many great patriots.

7666965,4,B01BT1W024,"Of the twelve astronauts to set foot on the moon, Gene Cernan is by my estimation the most eloquent speaker of the bunch. Cernan's ability to understand his audience, and then package his message to suit their level of comprehension - whether small children or mature space enthusiasts - is unique among the Apollo astronaut core. And with nearly 45 years of time between now and his last spaceflight, he still shows an exuberance for spaceflight as if he's talking about it for the first time. Mark Craig's film captures some of Gene's unique experiences moving through America's early space program.

First of all, the film excels in its telling of Gene's move through the US Navy ""flyboy"" days, the partial failure of Gemini IX, the close call of an uncontrolled spin in the LM after descent stage separation on Apollo 10, and of Apollo 17's high points, and of Cernan's life after leaving the astronaut core. The film also excels at going into Cernan's personal life - the relationship with daughter Tracy, his ex-wife, and his current wife, former Navy wingmen, and his impact on fellow astronauts Tom Stafford, Charlie Duke, Jim Lovell, flight director Chris Kraft, and Gene Kranz. I also liked the film's CG recreation of the transposition & docking maneuver from Apollo 10, but felt the CG recreation of Cernan's attempt to extract the jet pack at the back of the Gemini IX capsule looked 'rubbery' and fake.

For space enthusiasts, keep in mind that this film is more about Gene Cernan the man, than it is Gene Cernan the astronaut, and this is where the film was (at first) a bit frustrating for me. The film moves through Gemini IX and Apollo 17 at almost the same pace - and there were Apollo 17 omissions I thought were textbook among filmmakers, such as Cernan's last words from the moon (more inspiring than Armstrong's first words, in my opinion), Cernan and Schmitt singing the duet ""I was walking on the moon one day"" as they were closing out one of the geology stations, the iconic shot of Cernan bunny-hopping down the hill as he comments to Schmitt that it's a lot like skiing, Cernan's raised gold visor as he dusts off the rover's TV lens ""for a tune up,"" etc. etc. Perhaps these omissions were deliberate in order not to distract from the real issues, but Apollo 17's surface photography and TV is among the best of all the flights, and could have been explored further. There's also a few added sound effects not extant in some of the original footage that stood out - viz. rocket sounds during the (Apollo 4!) inter-stage separation footage, as well as the added sound of closing the Apollo command module hatch on what was a silent film. We do, however, get some rare footage from inside the LM during lunar orbit on Apollo 10, something Craig mentioned on his Twitter feed as original, but which I've seen before from Mark Gray's excellent Apollo 10 DVD set from Spacecraft Films. The film did, however, show a charred spacesuit from the Apollo 1 fire, which I had never seen before.

The real treasure of this film is Cernan's eloquence. The other 11 moonwalkers all fall short in some way: Armstrong despised fame and made it all about the mission, Aldrin always tries to push a political agenda and often comes across a bit too saccharine, Conrad is on record stating he's more proud of saving Skylab than he was landing on the moon (because ""it was easy""), Bean smiles his way through interviews to where you never get the deeply emotional aspects of it, Shepard was all business, Mitchell tended to quickly transition to the new age science of noetics, Scott is either chronically overlooked and when he is interviewed he's always given very little screen time, to me Irwin never really got the face time he deserved, Young is also deeply mission-oriented and is also a very subdued speaker, Duke can be exuberant but typically is asked more about being capcom for Apollo 11's landing than his own experience on Apollo 16, and Jack Schmitt tends to get overlooked or is largely quoted as being the 'scientist-astronaut' and little else. Craig captures some of Cernan's best one-liners, and the film ends with one of Cernan's best quotations - I won't spoil it for you. I also recommend seeing ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" and ""When We Left Earth"" for some of Cernan's additional thoughts on the experience. Craig also captures quite well Cernan's lamentation over what the space program is now vis-a-vis what it was 40 years ago, complete with shots of a lone Cernan walking around Pad 39A at the Space Center. Craig portrays Cernan's failures and weaknesses openly, which only balances out Cernan's accomplishments, which I felt was a stroke of brilliance.

Space enthusiasts: don't let the ""Cernan the Man"" angle deter you from watching this film. It is probably the last film of its kind for the last living 'national treasure' of the Apollo moonwalkers. I wish Armstrong, Conrad, and Shepard had been open to a film like this but sadly it's too late, and Scott and Young probably don't pique enough interest with filmmakers like Mark Craig who want to do a project like this. (Although a documentary of John Young's astronaut days would be deeply interesting to me - he has more miles in space than anyone of that era). I think the closest we'll get to peering inside the minds or hearts of those men is Andy Chaikin's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-on-the-Moon/dp/014311235X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man on the Moon</a>.""

7666979,5,B01BT1W024,"This amazingly heartfelt rendering of a true American hero and his overarching accomplishments gives Gemini and Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan the respect and personal accounting that any manned spaceflight fan and viewer will truly appreciate. This film is so well presented and so professionally constructed and so passionate that it should become almost a federal mandate that documentaries of this depth and quality be made of the surviving moon walkers before these iconic men are gone forever. This film is simply genuine docudrama at its finest.

To truly understand the context in which these men became a part of the manned spaceflight program, it is of course an obligation by the film makers to cover its inception. And as they present that here, Cernan's important position is juxtaposed upon each phase, a signal perhaps that most potential viewers might view as a tentative, routine or composite retelling of the story. But in this adventurous and contrasting approach, this ""juxtaposition"" is marvelously the heart of the film's seduction. We seem to march merrily along with Cernans mostly comedic retellings of his early NASA days until being suddenly stopped and thrust into this melancholic state by an almost surreal moment in which Gene, alone in his contemporary home office, is seen intently watching a video playback of the famous JFK moon commitment speech conducted at Rice University in 1962. As the speech culminates, the camera zooms in on Cernans face and his eyes seem to undergo a metamorphoseits suddenly as if hes been transported back to the young 28 year old image of himself as a fighter pilot whose intensity, commitment to the President and a promise to do as much as he can to make that dream come true are still his staunch ideals. And as he continues to watch, his demeanor remains unchanged, leaving little doubt that if given the opportunity, even at his advanced age, he would sign up again unconditionally. This for me was perhaps the most profound moment of the film.

Generously interspersed with commentary from past NASA astronaut peers (we see commentary from the now incomprehensibly elderly Tom Stafford, Dick Gordon, Alan Bean, Jim Lovell and Charlie Duke) along with Cernan's wonderful ex-wife Barbara and new wife Jan, his family life depiction is topped only by the absolutely wonderful treatment of his daughter Tracy, who Cernan's love and devotion comes across in a way to make all fathers proud, myself included.

It is Cernan's insights into those already well chronicled missions, however, that offer up a unique perspective rarely disclosed in all of the previously written and rather sterile human spaceflight histories...starting with his reaction at being selected to the backup crew (to Elliot See and Charlie Bassett) of Gemini 9 and the thrill of finally training for an actual flight, were instantly set into fast motion as his career begins to take off. Moving from devastating sorrow upon the tragic deaths of See and Bassett, were then quickly thrust into following Cernans transition to the prime crew where he must quickly learn the Gemini 9 flight plan. This mission intends for the pilot (Cernan now) to perform an EVA to unlatch the AMU (Astronaut Maneuvering Unit) from the rear of the spacecraft, but Cernan unfortunately becomes the pioneering victim to an untold number of EVA problems that soon haunt the program. Struggling mightily with everything from maneuverability to spacesuit overpressurization to ungainly umbilicals, Cernans ultimate failure to perform his tasks became a major part of the learning that NASA would ultimately need to help solve EVA problemand ironically this was learning in which he would be the beneficiary of six years later when he would spend three days on the moon in extended EVAs in the hot late Moon mornings of the Taurus-Littrow valley.

Soon 1966 would morph into 1969 and it was in May of that year that Cernan was again teamed with Tom Stafford, this time aboard Apollo 10, the fourth manned flight of the program and the final dress rehearsal for the first moon landing mission. If Apollo 10s flight goes smoothly, Apollo 11 will attempt the first landing on the moon in July. With John Young as Command Module Pilot, Cernan as LEM Pilot and Stafford as mission Commander, they will perform everything a moon landing mission will do except actually land their LEM Snoopy on the moon.

Undocking from Command Module Charlie Brown"" in lunar orbit, and executing powered descent and pitch-over, they skim the lunar surface at a mere 47,000 feet. Their mission plan is for the LEM upper stage to fire, disconnecting itself from the landing stage to power them back into lunar orbit and a rendezvous with Young in the Command Module. But when Cernan switches the ascent computer out of abort mode, the correct switch alignment, the ascent stage rolls 8 or 9 times with Stafford and especially Cernan expressing their unbelief and displeasure in rather colorful language on live TV. Finally regaining control (they were apparently just one or two more rolls away from crashing into the lunar surface) they were able to dock with Young and successfully complete the mission.

Next for Cernan came Apollo 17, a mission not without its own controversies as well. By this point, NASA had cancelled the remaining three flights in the program for budgetary reasons Apollo's 18 through 20 (even though all the hardware was already built and tested), so 17 would be the last to visit the moon. Since Cernan had been backup commander for Apollo 14, he was the natural choice to command Apollo 17 (the rather confusing crew rotations for the Apollo missions was that if a crew was selected as backup, they then skipped two and became the prime for the third). Unfortunately for Cernan, NASA was also committed to sending a geologist to the moon, but with the termination of the final three J missions, they suddenly had to decide whether to move Harrison Jack Schmitt, their one geologist whod been accepted and trained and who'd been slated as LEM pilot for Apollo 18 under the command of Dick Gordon, up to Apollo 17 in the crew manifest.

Hearing Cernan contemporarily explain this issue is really a measure of the man. During training and prior to Deke Slayton (the chief of the astronaut office and the man in charge of selecting the prime crew) announcing who would fly this final mission, Cernan gets careless and crashes a training helicopter into the nearby Indian River. Accepting at that point and even to this day that Dick Gordon deserved command of the mission, it was with great shock when he was told by Slayton that he was still the guy. What Cernan didn't realize was that it was very taboo in Slayton's mind to break up Apollo crews...if Schmitt had to fly with the prime crew and Slayton was ordered to make it so, then so be it, but he would not alter the rest of the crew who'd worked so hard for it. Deke (one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts) was nothing if not loyal. Cernan though, felt, and still feels, that Gordon deserved the spot, but because he was nonetheless selected, he gave his all during preparation and the ultimate mission success was clearly representative of that commitment.

Apollo 17 was launched spectacularly on December 7, 1972 at night (the only night Apollo launch) but only after a 2 hour 40 minute delay (which was also a first in Apollo Saturn V history) when the launch countdown sequencer automatically cut-off the launch sequence at T-30 seconds due to an error in which it thought it hadn't pressurized the LOX tank in the S-IVB stage correctly. Following repair, the launch was reported to be seen as far north as New York City.

Once on the moon and due to the lunar surface film technology having been improved dramatically, the three subsequent EVAs were spectacular, topped with Schmitts discovery of volcanic orange soil on day two's EVA at Shorty Crater. And Cernan, as the last to leave the lunar surface and remarkably out of breath from the exhaustive final tasks to prepare for departure, nonetheless spoke eloquently before ascending the LEM ladder for the final time: And as we leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came, and god willing as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.

Upon arriving home safely, Cernan was of course besieged with calls and requests for his time, all of which saw him away from home literally more so than when he was training for NASA missions. Finally not willing to put up with it any longer, his wife Barbara and he divorced, seemingly amicably, and in the end, we see a still very busy and accommodating Cernan, incredibly now at 82, still working at his ranch, still filling speaking appointments and, profoundly for this film, re-visiting Kennedy Space Center and Launch pad 39A, where over 43 years ago he sat atop the mythic Saturn V launch vehicle and rocketed to the moon.

Today the facility is there, still configured in the now retired Space Shuttle program launch arrangement while being in a dis-repaired and abandoned state, showing its age with weeds growing up in and around the concrete and with rust manifesting the pad's exposed equipment in concert with its constant exposure to the ocean air. And in another moving and emotion filled moment of this film, we watch as Cernan meanders about, surveying the scene before walking disgustedly away, telling us, the viewer, who watch mesmerized with this stark coming together of past and present, how disappointed he is in the state of the current manned spaceflight program, ending his thought with a profoundly sad and telling statement, I wish Id never come back here.

A film of enormous grace and emotion that is nonetheless balanced brilliantly with one mans important mark on NASA's manned spaceflight program, most viewers will undoubtedly come away from this documentary marveling at the character of Gene Cernan. And I must again maintain that this expert documentary treatment be administered to the remaining moon walkersnot only for today's young generation to see and learn from but as an emotional/visual history of these mens very important perspective of an unspeakably important period of American history.",1463184000,,10229,4.947613504074505

7666981,5,B01BT1W024,"This will be no long winded write-up or spoiler alert.  This documentary is outstanding.  Cernan speaks so eloquantly of his experiences that I could almost feel what he felt at the time.  No other astronaut interview made me feel this way, not even the beloved Jim Lovell.  For anyone not of that generation, you want to know what it was like for one person to go to the moon?  Watch and listen to Gene Cernan.  There are only a couple of CGI scenes, one of the Cernan's Gemini mission.  The second of the Apollo 10 extraction of the LM prior to TLI.  The CGI work is excellent.  There's only a couple of minor issues with how the LM Snoopy is depicted.  Great film.  Loved it.  I'm going to show it to my kids.",1463011200,,712,4.2706766917293235

7666986,3,B01BT1W024,"Beautifully filmed but flawed, failure of a documentary. A filmmaker approaching the Apollo space program faces a colossal challenge. What is history, and what is mythologizing, ideological, and metaphorical use of history? Who are the astronauts as symbols of the Right Stuff - guts, gumption, and duty-honoring -  are who are the astronauts as men with ambition, flaws, and personal motives? Is the history of the Apollo space program a metaphor of a time of aspirational national identity, or is it history as it impacted the daily lives of the people it most intimately affected, the wives, children, and other astronauts?

By focusing on Eugene Cernan, director Mark Craig's ambition is to tell the story of the Apollo space program with the latter, revisionist themes in mind - astronauts beyond symbolism, history as daily life. Yet, Craig fails to gain the documentary filmmaker's critical distance, and ends up retelling mostly the ideological, symbolic history instead. That's not to say there aren't glimpses into the real person, a truer, more flawed character who appears not quite self-aware of his mixed motives - his personal ambition, his relishing of celebrity, and the toll they took on his family. Cernan's most candid moment occurs when he almost realizes he cannot - and never has - put his family's interests before his own, as he reflects on his life in what is seemingly an endless string of generic hotel rooms on the road as celebrity astronaut. We see other glimpses when Cernan revisits the neighborhood the astronauts all lived in, but there too Craig falls short of going beyond the 'live fast and play hard' stereotype. And Craig also stops short of providing any new insight into why Cernan was chosen for the final Apollo mission. We get the setup, Cernan's helicopter crash that apparently doomed his chances, and then an unsatisfying account of why Cernan was chosen. And we see Cernan voice regret when he revisits the Cape, now abandoned and decaying. Yet Craig avoid this opportunity to probe a life now defined by nostalgic remembrance and what it must be like to live a life that is defined by a single, transcendent experience that now exists only in memory.",1462147200,3,2200,4.991825613079019
7666987,1,B01BT1W024,"This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen, especially since it seems nigh impossible to make a boring film on this subject.

RIDICULOUS ""cutsey"" cartoon sequences? Check.
INSUFFERABLY scrambled ""score"" or soundtrack ranging from cheesy 50s tunes to Gregorian chants (guess when? OUTER SPACE).
Double check.
INCREDIBLY overlong rehash of everything from Sputnik to Apollo 11? (which will be helpful if you are a moron of ANY age who has lived under a rock your entire existence).
Triple check.

The ONLY memorable moment comes from Cernan's long-suffering wife, who utters a line that echoes and is worthy of a place in Homer's ""Odyssey"": ""You think going to the moon is hard? Try staying home."" The plight of women in patriarchal societies forever, since only men can sit in seats and toggle spacecraft controls.",1462147200,9,826,5.0661764705882355

7666989,5,B01BT1W024,"If you have any interest in NASA, the moon, Apollo, Gemini etc. then there are four movies that you absolutely must have in your collection.  In the shadow of the moon, When we left earth and the two superb hollywood productions Apollo 13 and the mini series From the Earth to the moon.

Well make space in your collection for another must have movie, every bit as good if not better than those above.  The Last man on the Moon.

I have a vast collection of movies regarding NASA and their missions including all the Spacecraft films movies about Mercury, Gemini and Apollo (these contain the original NASA footage of the missions albeit edited) and there is a lot of footage in this movie that I have never seen before.

The last man on the moon is really the story of Gene Cernan, one of only 12 people in the whole of humanity that has ever set foot on the moon and even rarer, one of only three people to have ever travelled to the moon twice (John Young and Jim Lovell being the other two).  Gene was the Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 10 ""Painting a big white line in the sky"" for Neil Armstrong to follow in his historic Apollo 11 lunar landing.  Gene was also the Commander of the last Apollo mission, Apollo 17 and was the last person to have set foot on the moon.

It has been nearly 45 years since that historic last mission and Gene (and others) reflect on this, how sad he is that America has never followed it up.  He hopes one day that somebody will go back to his landing site, go the rover that he left there and see where he inscribed his daughters initials on the moons surface.

The movie expertly details the key moments in Genes life, from his early days in the navy, to getting the call to join NASA.  His Gemini and both Apollo missions.  Along with Gene, former Apollo astronauts Jim Lovell, Alan Bean, Dick Gordon and Tom Stafford appear in the movie along with Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz from operations in ""Houston"" as it was affectionately known.

This movie was 5 years in the making and Gene graciously gave much of his time to the film crew allowing them full access to his home, his ranch, even his daughters surprise 50th birthday party (one of the Extras on the Blu Ray).

The movie itself is 95 minutes long with 8 extras packed into the Blu Ray release.  One point worth noting is that if your only Blu Ray player is an Xbox one then you are out of luck as the Xbox One will not play this.  Works fine on the Playstation however.  The photography is excellent and in certain parts there are some CGI scenes which are the best depictions I have seen in a biography.

As I said before, if you have any interest in space then this is a must have movie and even if you don't this is still very much worth a watch.  I can see why it has already won so many awards.",1461801600,11,2794,4.267552182163188

7666996,5,B01BT1W024,"This was a very special movie since it is being told by Eugene Cernan. Life was hard training for an astronaut, we all know that but the show even showed it harder than what we saw on TV in the early years. Hard on the families too. And for Eugene to admit how easy it was to have the publicity of his new role as a ""super--man"" take him to places and doing things he now regrets is very inspiring. The astronauts were treated like super bengs because they were but that lead to 8 out of 10 divorces. Sad. I would like to know more about all of the children as adults now how they felt about their fathers being so special and gone most of their childhood. They saw their fathers more on TV than at home sometimes. I admire every man and women that participated in every single part of the space program in the early days. Every single person who had a part was important from janitor to security people. Not just the mission control men or the engineers. It took a great bunch of men and women to have all the astronauts reach their goals. And I thank them all. I am a ""Sputnik"" child and I still love every launch to the ISS to keep supplies going up and to rotate each person going to and from the ISS. Thanks to all of you. This movie is going to be a treasure forever for my family since my daughter got to meet Mr. Cernan at John Glenn's launch on the shuttle. She got her photo with many astronauts since she and her roommate represented Space Camp California for the launch and then the party afterwards is where she met and got priceless photos of many great men.",1461196800,,1572,4.191419141914191

There have been many other books and documentaries as well, including Gene Cernan's book of the same title as this movie.  I have an autographed copy that I surely will treasure.  Sadly, the Apollo Moon Walkers still living are now all in their 80s and probably won't be around to see any manned missions to Mars.  If we ever do go, we owe a lot of the inspiration to these brave men from the Apollo era, and most of all to President Kennedy, who more than 50 years ago set the wheels in motion.  At 66, I only hope I live to see it myself.  Like Apollo we only need the political will to do it!

His LMP Harrison (""Jack"") Schmitt followed Gene onto the moon, making Jack the 12th man to walk on the moon. This film highlights the humble beginnings of the space program and includes cameos/interviews with the remaining Astronauts of the Gemini/Apollo programs, For some reason, neither Jack Schmitt nor Buzz Aldrin were included in this film. I find that odd, especially since Jack spent 3 days on the moon with Gene. Even his ex-wife was interviewed (a very complimentary addition). Alan Bean, Jim Lovell, Chris Kraft and Tom Stafford offer a lot of ""inside baseball"" information - stuff most folks never knew.

8751318,2,B01BT1W024,"I am 66 years old.  I can remember the day when it was announced on Dave Garroway's Today Show that Yuri Gagarin become the first human launched into space.  I remember shortly afterward but very clearly, the day when Alan Shepard rode his Mercury spacecraft atop a Redstone missile to become the first American in space.  I remember Gus Grissom nearly drowning when his Liberty Bell 7 capsule sank in the Atlantic.  In short, since my early days as a young boy, I have followed America's manned space program and I remember nearly every milestone along the way.

Now, as to this video.  I have to say, I was disappointed.  I'm glad that I only spent 9 bucks on it because I will more than likely be donating it to Good will.  I admired Gene Cernan immensely.  He was a true American hero who laid his life on the line in the line of duty but, in return, lived a life and saw things that most of us could only dream about.  But this video is almost completely ""fluff"" about Gene's life after the space program and contains very little substance about the actual space program or about the men and machines that got America to the moon.

In summary, if you are a big fan of Cene Cernan's and want to know how and where he spent his final days, or know what he ate for breakfast, or care about his musings or where he wants to be buried, this is the video for you.
