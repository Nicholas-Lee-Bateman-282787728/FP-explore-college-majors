8637844,1,B00I099JUK,The rating is not for the show which is great but for the quality of the dvds. If either Mill Creek or Echo Bridge  are involved the product is going to be subpar. Its cheaper but they they try to cram too many episodes on too few discs. If you can find the Sony version you will be far happier even if you have to pay a few dollars more.,1523836800,,338,3.8285714285714287

8637846,4,B00I099JUK,"Phil Hartman left Saturday Night Live to play Bill McNeal in ""News Radio,"" a sitcom about life behind the scenes of WNYX AM radio station. Phil's Bill was an egoistical and full of hubris. Regardless Bill was only one character of the show. To me and viewers, Phil was already a television star. We lost Phil in 1998 and his loss was heaven's gain. The series never fully recovered from his loss and a season later.

The first two seasons displayed Phil's comedic genius in the role. Bill wasn't the only eccentric character in the series. Andy Dick's character, Matthew was also funny as well. Stephen Root's wealthy owner Jimmy James. Catherine was first played be Ella Joyce and recast with Khandi Alexander in the role. Toby Huss and Tone Loc played security officers too.

The relationship between Dave and Lisa was integral for laughs. Dave Foley and Maura Tierney were perfect in their roles. I loved Vicki Lewis as Beth, the secretary. I always mixed her up with The other redhead. Joe Rogan played handyman Joe. There were plenty of notable guest appearances like Bebe Neuwirth, Dennis Miller, Jane Lynch and others.

On three DVDs, the first season was only 7 episodes and included a second season with 22 episodes. No special features. The series deserved more since it was funny and smart too. Even watching on my laptop, I still miss the laughs especially miss Phil Hartman more than ever. I just love seeing the old New York City skyline with the twin towers in the opening credits of the series.",1498694400,,1510,4.733840304182509
