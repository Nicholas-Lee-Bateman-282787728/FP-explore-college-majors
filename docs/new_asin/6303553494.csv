8373046,2,6303553494,"I am a huge fan of The Jerky Boys but I thought this movie was a major disappointment. The biggest complaint that I have and that other fans of the albums will have is that all of the ""obsene language"" was censored. Also, the majority of the skits such as the calls to MTV studios seem very contrived. The only scenes worth viewing are the ones where Johhny B and Kamal gain access to an intercom in a supermarket and bother the customers. If there are any fans like me who are still out there you have been warned.",1134259200,,515,4.212121212121212
