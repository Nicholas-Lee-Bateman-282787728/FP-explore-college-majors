7955322,1,B00005UQ7H,"I recently ordered this movie from Amazon hoping to watch this wonderfully bizarre piece of kung fu again.  It is one of my favorite martial arts movies that I haven't seen in years.  Well, they got the cover right, but the dvd in the sleeve was a dvr of Shaolin Drunk Fighter.  Wrong movie and not even a legitimate copy.  Close but no cigar.",1327536000,2,343,4.3125
7955323,5,B00005UQ7H,"Shaolin Drunkard is a lost 70's classic, choreographed and performed by the Yuen clan, and directed by Yuen Woo Ping, who was later famous for his choreography work on Drunken Master, The Matrix  Trilogy and the Kill Bills.  Although this is one of my favorite Hong Kong films of all time, this is not what one would expect from a Hong Kong kungfu comedy.  It's not that there aren't many amazing fights, it's that the film is also full of slapstick comedy, chinese magic, mythological fighting techniques, a little bit of wire work, and an insane soundtrack full of 70's analog synthesizer effects.  If you don't enjoy silliness, taoist magical mayhem, blood drinking sorcerers, and a demented love interest, this film may irritate you.  I love all of the above, so this was right up my alley.  An essential for fans of the Yuen Clan's masterful work.  Unfortunately, I cannot find any versions of this film with the original audio and original laguage, only english overdub.",1198540800,,976,4.843373493975903
7955324,1,B00005UQ7H,"This is for products only! Morons! Anyways! I bought a
copy of Shaolin Drunkard by Ground Zero Ent. Man, GZ Ent. are a
bunch of uneducated mongoloids! This copy I got, the DVD would
keep pausing and playing over and over again! And when you
upload the extras, these squares would appear out of nowhere and
the DVD will stop playing! So word to the wise, don't get the
Ground Zero version copy, not unless you're one of those people
who are easily amused by train wreck products!

The movie itself is like Miricle Fighters and Taoism Drunkard!
Alot of weird crap with some nifty kung fu and Cantonese humor!",1115596800,3,606,4.509090909090909
7955325,3,B00005UQ7H,"There are some good fight scenes and a good story in this one along with widescreen and 5.1,but it shoots itself in the foot with that way over the top asian film humor,dont get me wrong  I like alot of the comedy/Kung Fu films just not this one becouse they go to far not taking the film itself serious. If you want some funny Fu get ""drunken master""the new or old one there both great or Snake in the eagles shadow. I cannot recommend Shaolin Drunkard.",1082851200,3,454,4.27906976744186
7955326,5,B00005UQ7H,"I was very pleased with the content of this DVD both on screen and the extra feature materials. The transfer quality is superb for both sound(5.1) and film(widescreen).The movie itself is an earlier work of Yuen Woo Ping,and it holds up nicely. The extras are plentiful-previews(18 of them),cast and crew bios with alot of bonus clips for each actor(too many to count),and alot of Wu Tang Clan extras-live performances,interviews,etc. Also a couple of behind the scenes featurettes. Overall a very good buy. I would also suggest the following-Fearless Master,Snake Shadow Lama Fist,Kung Fu of the 8 Drunkards and Incredible Kung Fu Master,which are all under the Wu Tang Clan series.",1018137600,4,683,5.218181818181818
