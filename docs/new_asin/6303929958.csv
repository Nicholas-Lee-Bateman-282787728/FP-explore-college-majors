766513,4,6303929958,This movie is so sweet. Deanna Durbin shines in a role that could've been sweetly sick but instead often has spunk. Helen Parrish is awesome as her evil cousin and this movie has some great songs and some great scenes. Deanna's performance in this movie is so good that it makes one wonder what Deanna may have done with Wizard of Oz.,1144800000,,334,4.403225806451613
766514,4,6303929958,"Deanna Durbin stars in First Love, her own version of Cinderella. She plays a sweet, innocent, and friendly orphan named Connie who goes to live with her spoiled socialite cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) when she graduates from an all girl's school. She wins over the staff with her well-trained singing voice and energy who encourage her to break her cousin's rigid rules and have a little fun. However, Barbara constantly tries to guilt Connie into doing things for her, such as feigning sick to stall her friends so she can sleep in. On this escapade, Connie runs into the guy everyone seems to love (Robert Stack) who becomes fascinated with the mysterious Connie. Later, they meet again when the staff helps Connie go to a party despite Barbara's efforts to detain her. There, Connie is a sensation, singing and dancing all night with a love-struck Ted. However, after being advised to leave by midnight to avoid running into Barbara and her mother, she leaves in a hurry leaving an enchanted Ted with only a shoe to remember her by.

It is strange how much Durbin and Parrish look alike, which really compliments the film. However, the two couldn't be more different in this film. They make the trite but true story of Cinderella come to life in a way different enough not to bore.

The music in this film is very much like an operetta, but one cannot deny Durbin's talent in this type of singing.",1137369600,,1402,4.695121951219512
766515,4,6303929958,"First Love is a contemporary Cinderella story about an orphaned young woman (Deanna Durbin) sent to live with her wealthy, snobbish cousins, who jealously obstruct all her attempts to socialize, ultimately denying her access to the big ball.  But the staff of their big house - butler, maids, cook, and chauffeur - make surreptitious arrangements for her, including a fabulous dress and detainment of the rest of the family.  Of course Durbin's beautiful singing makes her the hit of the ball, until she has to run out at midnight missing one slipper.  Eugene Pallette is great as her uncle, the only member of the family that's not stuck up, though he's too busy to prevent the situation.  A very young Robert Stack has a small role equivalent to Cinderella's ""Prince.""  I've seen 5 or 6 Deanna Durbin films, and this one's right in the middle.  I didn't like it quite as much as Mad About Music, The Amazing Mrs. Holliday, or It Started With Eve, but it's clearly better than Can't Help Singing and Lady On A Train.",1131235200,,1017,4.685393258426966
766516,5,6303929958,"I truly love this film. If asked by someone who had yet to see a Deanna Durbin film where to start,  in order to get a sense of her magic, I would direct them to this film. She was just beginning to blossom from the teenage sensation who saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy into the natural and lovely actress who would have such a deft touch for comedy, while still maintaining the most beautiful voice to ever come out of Hollywood.

Durbin simply glows here and is pretty enough to make a young man's heart ache in this modern day Cinderella story. Fashioned by Joe Pasternak in a very glossy production and directed by Henry Koster, the screenplay by Bruce Manning and Lionell Houser has just the right blend of the touching, the sweet and the humorous as Deanna would receive her first screen kiss.

The sweet soul Connie (Deanna) is an orphan graduating from an all girls high school presided over by Miss Wiggins (Kathleen Howard). While all her friends are going home after graduation, Connie is headed for New York to live with her uncle Jim (Eugene Pallette) and his spoiled family because he has paid for her tuition and taken care of her in a financial sense since the death of her parents.

From the moment Connie arrives she is a breath of fresh air to the stuffy mansion. Her cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) is a spoiled brat being waited on hand and foot with no interest outside of her social standing other than the rich young man coveted by all in her circle named Tom Drake (Robert Stack). Her aunt Grace is superficially nice but a little batty about astrology and her cousin Walter (Lewis Howard) spends all his time avoiding work of any kind.

Just as in My Man Godfrey, Eugene Pallette as her uncle Jim is the only normal one in the bunch! So exasperated is he with his family, he is only at home when they are gone and rarely talks to anyone, even Connie. But it is only a matter of time until he blows. Connie's sweet demeanor begins to rub off on all the servants in the houshold as they fall in love with her. Charles Coleman as the Clinton's butler George, Jack Mulhall as the chauffeur, Lucille Ward as the cook and Dorothy Vaughan as the maid are delightful as they come to her aid with improvisational magic when Barbara schemes to keep Connie from going to the big society ballroom party.

Connie is dying to go, of course, as she's met Tom by this time and love has begun to bloom in her young heart. Frank Jenks as the black sheep of the family, Mike, helps detour Barbara and Connie's aunt until midnight, so she can have her chance. Connie makes the most of it, even getting to be the hit of the gala when she mistakenly thinks she is being asked to sing when in fact it was an opera star attending the party!

Durbin's first screen kiss truly was magical, with the breathless excitement of it caught perfectly but not overblown. It was simply a part of the story. But that story ends at midnight for Connie, who leaves in such a rush that she leaves behing a silver slipper. Her mean spirited cousin Barbara tries to take away her momentary euphoria by convincing her Ted was just toying with her.

Even though we can see what is coming next a mile away, there are some genuinely moving moments in this wonderful film. Some lovely songs like Puccini's One Fine Day and the old standard Home Sweet Home are worked into the story nicely. Durbin also gets to sing Spring In My Heart, adapted from Johann Strauss Waltzes with lyrics by Ralph Freed. The finest musical moment here, however, I believe, is when she sings the beautiful Amapola. It will take your breath away.

There is magic all through this film and her name is Deanna Durbin. I can not recommend this wonderful film any higher. I can only say, if you don't love this film, then you simply don't love the movies.",1114214400,3,3814,4.468390804597701

I still sigh when I see him in this movie.  And if the two charming leads aren't enough, the music is enchanting and the story is innocent and romantic.

Most people today I am sure do not know that Deanna was let go by MGM by error...Lois B Mayer actually said when deciding between  Deanna andJudy Garland who at that point had only made a 10 minute short film for MGM, said ""let the fat one go"" he wanted to keep Deanna, but the deal was done, Universal quickly signed her and she is widely credited for saving Universal from Bankruptcy All these popints can be verified, every book written on the subject tells this...Deanna out shined Judy and retired quite early in her career, think at age 27, she never enjoyed the Hollywood lifestyle, she retired as the richest woman in Hollywood

7859898,5,6303929958,"As a big fan of Robert Stack, I had to have this movie in my collection, and I am very glad I got it.  I have known about this film ever since I was 13 years old, at the beginning of my affection for Robert Stack (fifty-two years ago!), but had never seen it.  I'm sorry I waited so long, but it was worth the wait.  There is humor, pathos, and drama in an excellent mixture.  Connie, the protagonist, (Deanna Durbin) is graduating from an exclusive girl's school, located presumably in California.  She has been sent there, and the education paid for, by her rich uncle.  The school is run by Miss Wiggins (Kathleen Howard), a spinster with a crusty exterior but a heart full of love for her young students.  Then Connie, an orphan, goes to New York City to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle, and her spoiled and poison-mean cousin.  At least she has only one wicked cousin to put up with instead of three wicked stepsisters.  In this case, one is enough, as Helen Parrish does a fine job of creating the woman we love to hate in cousin Barbara Clinton.  Leatrice Joy is also wonderful as Barbara's ditzy mother, Aunt Grace, who runs her life and everyone else's based on astrology.  The much put-upon head of the household, James Clinton (Eugene Palette) finally shows backbone and shakes up the household when Barbara's meanness causes Connie to flee back to Miss Wiggins's school and causes the household staff to quit.

The ""Cinderella"" theme is overt, but that is not a drawback.  It provides the perfect framework for the story.  The household staff takes up the role of the household animals of the Disney version of the tale, as the butler, the maids, the cook, and the chauffeur (and the cook's policeman brother) all pitch in to get Connie ready for the ball.  The conspiracy they pull off when Barbara and Aunt Grace try to prevent Connie from going to the ball is priceless.

I had never seen Deanna Durbin in anything before, and I wish I had.  She had a wonderful singing voice and a sense of comedic timing that plays well in this film.  Drama was not beyond her, either, as she handles a heartfelt scene between Connie and Miss Wiggins with confidence.  For one so young (17 years old), she was already a professional performer.

Robert Stack was around 20 years old when he took the part of Ted Drake for this movie.  He is the perfect handsome dreamboat, and shows up in his natural blond hair.  Later, being advised that blonds weren't usually selected as leading men, he dyed his hair black (and it was in this wise that he appeared as Eliot Ness in ""The Untouchables"").  To my mind he was one of those men who got better looking as he got older, and to me he was in his prime of manly handsomeness in ""The Untouchables,"" when he was between 40 and 43 years old (1959-1963).  Having grown up in real life in the social milieu portrayed in the film, he was perfect for the part, and shows himself to be a wonderful and romantic dancer.  (Swoon!)

Having heard so much about The Kiss in this film, when young Robert Stack gave Deanna Durbin her first screen kiss, I was eager to see what the buzz was all about.  Meh.  To me, it came off as not much, and over too quick.  For those of us who want to see Robert Stack romantic, the kiss he gives Pat Crowley in ""The Scarface Mob"" (the theatrical version of the original two-parter ""The Untouchables,"" which launched the series) is far more romantic and, let's face it, downright sexy.  But this film is far more than the famous kiss, and does a great job of entertaining the ""chick flick"" audience.  If it ever comes out on DVD, I will buy that version, too.",1339200000,,3629,4.453030303030303

7859900,5,6303929958,"In 1939, singing sweetheart Deanna Durbin was eighteen years old, all grown up and ready for her very first screen romance.  She found it in FIRST LOVE, a delightful spin on the ""Cinderella"" story, in which she co-stars with a young Robert Stack.

Orphaned Connie Harding (Deanna Durbin) has just graduated college and moved in with her rich uncle's family.  The servants welcome her with open arms, but her snooty cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) is another story. However, kind-hearted Connie always goes out of her way to be of help, even assisting Barbara's none-too-subtle plans to land handsome bachelor Ted Drake (Robert Stack).  After she's stopped from attending a large party at Ted's mansion, heartsick Connie is given a helping hand by the kind servants who provide a beautiful new dress, white fur coat and a police escort to the party!  But what will happen when Connie accidentally stays past midnight and loses her shoe whilst trying to flee from suspicious Barbara?

Love finally comes calling for Deanna in this, perhaps the most delightful of all her movies.  This adorable ""Cinderella"" tale is a delight from start to finish.  Impeccably cast, Durbin's co-stars include familiar faces like Eugene Pallette, Charles Coleman, Leatrice Joy and Marcia Mae Jones.  Deanna sings her immortal ""One Fine Day"" from 'Madama Butterfly', plus ""Amapola"".

If you adore Deanna Durbin, you'll fall head over heels for FIRST LOVE...",1211068800,2,1434,5.142241379310345
