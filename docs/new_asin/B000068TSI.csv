1726639,5,B000068TSI,"""Those of us who have seen war keep seeing it. In the silence of the night, we still hear the screams.""
War is hell, and ""We Were Soldiers"" spends its entire relaying this brutal truth in a story that overflows with patriotic zeal, a convincing sense of chaos, and a harsh depiction of the physical reality of combat conditions. Like Ridley's Scott's ""Black Hawk Down,"" released in the holiday stretch of 2001, writer/director Randall Wallace, in his directorial debut, is careful to remind us of the emotional impact of war rather than sacrificing it for effects and thrills.
It seems that Wallace has learned from previous misfires: the story, adapted from the novel by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway, is everything that Wallace's previous script, ""Pearl Harbor,"" was not. Beginning with the introductions to military life as seen through the eyes of various soldiers and officers, we are given a unique opportunity to become involved in their family lives, bearing witness to happier times before President Johnson orders reinforcements into Vietnam.
Mel Gibson is cast as Harold Moore, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, arriving on base with his wife, Julie (Madeleine Stowe), and five young children. Among those singled out by the story to provide emotional connections are young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) and his expecting wife, Barbara (Keri Russell), Maj. Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear), who shows a great deal of devotion to duty, and Sgt-Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott), who exacts a brutish demeanor as a result of decades of wartime experience.
After a montage of tearful goodbyes that pull at the heartstrings with all their might, Wallace's film nosedives into the hellish combat of the Battle of Ia Drang, as Moore's soldiers are choppered in under heavy fire from the soldiers of the Viet Cong. After splitting into divisions, several men are surrounded, many of whom are seriously wounded, leading Moore to regroup and make attempts to rescue his entrapped soldiers, all the while battling forces surrounding his own.
These brilliantly photographed and acted scenes of battle are some of cinema's most memorable, charged with physical intensity that practically jolts the audience with each explosion and gunshot. Wallace brings the viewer into the experience rather than making him a sideline witness to it, wrapping us in a continuous onslaught of sensory perception, from startling images of bloodshed and mangled bodies, to the non-stop firing of machine guns and heavy artillery.
Accompanying such moments are a constant reminder of the emotional loss and grievances one goes through in times of war. We see young reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper) befriending a Japanese-American soldier in the middle of combat; ten minutes later, he's rushing towards a rescue chopper, his bloodied friend hanging loose in his arms. We see the tear-strained faces of wives informed of their lost husbands. We see these soldiers, once young, their innocence stripped from them as they stare into the eyes of the enemy, and instantly, the emotional magnitude of such an event becomes a stark reality.
But through it all, we see something richer, something well-defined, something forgotten in much of the modern war drivel that has graced the silver screen in years past. ""We Were Soldiers"" not only packs a physical and emotional punch, but brings to light an overwhelming aura of patriotism that is evident in the heroic acts of its characters, a sense of duty and devotion that makes the movie's dialogue ring true in every way, shape and form.
In playing Harold Moore, Mel Gibson recalls the glory and presence of his performance in ""Braveheart;"" his ability to juxtapose a stern demeanor with true, heartfelt displays of emotion hasn't lost its luster. The under-used Madeleine Stowe portrays Julie as a strong-willed military wife, while Keri Russell makes good use of her onscreen time. Each of the cast members who make up Moore's cavalry give heartfelt performances, most notably Barry Pepper as Galloway, whose narration bookends the film.
Movies like ""We Were Soldiers"" benefit from a connection to reality. The inclusion of characters Moore and Galloway serve to remind us of the factual basis for the stunning visual and emotional assault that conveys war and those affected by it. Wallace's film, while being a great tribute to those who fought for a war still misunderstood by many, is a patriotic display of courage, heroism, honor, and the knowledge that for those who have seen war, victory is bittersweet.",1015027200,30,4596,5.170469798657718
1726640,4,B000068TSI,"In recent months, war-related movies Behind Enemy Lines, Black Hawk Down, Hart's War and Collateral Damage have battled it out at the box office. In light of September 11th, their subject matter has gained a profound new meaning, addressing the nature of war and why we wage it. Now, We Were Soldiers steps onto the cinematic battlefield and emerges as the clear victor, well-worth the price of admission.
We Were Soldiers tells the story of Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore (Mel Gibson) and the battle at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang valley, the first major conflict between North Vietnamese troops and American troops in the Vietnam War.
Gibson shines in the role, showing us an intelligent, thinking, brave and determined leader. He won't ask a man to do what he won't do himself: ""I will be the first to step on the field and I will be the last to step off,"" he assures his troops. He reads books and studies the nature of his enemy carefully. He trains his men meticulously, preparing them for the ominous battle to come. ""Men will die,"" he tells his troops, knowing that he and his men are at a disadvantage against an enemy on their own turf.
In addition to Gibson, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and Keri Russell all give outstanding, A+ performances. Kinnear plays Bruce Crandall, a chopper pilot showing determination and courage while still revealing his fear of death in the course of battle. Pepper plays Joe Galloway, the journalist who rides into the heat of battle to get his story first-hand. (Just wait until you hear his reason for becoming a journalist instead of a soldier.) And in spite of my personal disdain for her character on the WB's Felicity, Russell inspires us as a strong-willed mother, in spite of the possibility of losing her husband Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) at war.
The film does an exceptional job of transitioning from place-to-place, whether from one area of the battlefield to another, to the women and children back home, you always have a good sense of where things are happening and when they're taking place. When one platoon is cut off from the rest of the soldiers, when riverbeds are won and lost, you know exactly what effect it has on the battle. You experience first-hand the grave danger these soldiers experienced. You mourn their deaths and cheer their victories because in spite of the fact that you're sitting in a movie theater, you feel like you're there in battle with them, facing the possibility of death, witnessing the horror of it all.
Writer-director Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask) spends a fair amount of time showing us what is going on behind enemy lines from the point of view of the North Vietnamese. I first heard this was an element of the film before I saw it and was afraid they were going to portray the communist North Vietnamese in a sympathetic light. But, interestingly, these scenes added to the drama and suspense of the film. We see what each leader is thinking and planning for the next attack, which only builds more suspense in anticipation of the next scene to come.
A sense of family is well-portrayed among the soldiers, and especially among the wives at home. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the wife of Lt. Col. Moore. She heads up the group of wives, giving moral support and preparing them as best she can for the possible death of their husbands. Her and Russell show us the chilling events of how they dealt with relaying the notices of the deaths of their friends' husbands.
What is lacking in the film is mention of how the war started, or that North Vietnam was communist. Although these are well-known facts, they are too important to pass over in a film about the Vietnam War.
The filmmakers have been saying in their media appearances that this is an anti-war movie due to the graphic nature of the battle scenes. Be prepared: the battles scenes are graphic, but I did not come away thinking they were pro- or anti-war. The sheer quantity of gore can never trump the morality of why we fight a war. These scenes only dramatize the risks of fighting a war, and who and what is at stake. The political elements shown in the film (e.g., how we went into Vietnam unprepared, and failed to properly arm our men in the best way possible) only demonstrate, in my view, that if we do choose to fight a war, we must do so acknowledging the risks and then proceed with the moral certainty that our cause is right, with only one goal: to win.
We Were Soldiers is the best war movie Hollywood has released since September 11th, showing us how to fight a battle and how not to fight a war. With outstanding acting and a wide variety of emotions, it is a tribute and a salute to those who fought in Vietnam, and to any soldier who fights for America.",1014940800,11,4761,4.615566037735849
1726641,4,B000068TSI,"This film will rank as one of the all time great battle movies.  It's not a war movie; it doesn't try to prove a point or tell the tale of a whole war.  Just one very meaningful, and very heroic (and tragic) battle.
It's not a 'message' movie, or a blatant political statement, or a movie that shows a bunch of roaming, scared, crazy or doped up GIs trading attrocities with the enemy.  It shows a valiant, dignified effort from solid, young, and patriotic soldiers in one of the few major *conventional* battles of Vietnam (before the war turn exclusively guerilla).
The movie has a good human touch too, wonderfully portayed by Gibson, who shows where the battle really begins...in his mind during training camp and battle study at home.  It gets into politics tangentially, for a Vietnam movie could not be made without some nod to the heavy political weight that plagued the war and its soldiers.  But politics were relatively under the surface back then...back then before it was a huge quagmire...back then when soldiers didn't doubt their patriotism and their country didn't doubt their integrity.
A great depiction of a great, unsung slice of history.  You'll enjoy it (but beware the violence and gory a la Saving Private Ryan).  Special effects and discussion of tactics also make this movie special (and the enemy has a face, voice and brain, too).  Maybe some of the pauses are a bit too drawn out, that's the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review.  But don't miss out on this one!!",1014854400,25,1506,4.695817490494297

1726643,5,B000068TSI,"I had the distinguished honor of going to the Atlanta premiere of this movie with a man who flew this same type of helicopters later in the war. The movie was excellent. It brought alive a very balanced mixture of emotions. It was painful, it was humorous. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott brought to life the real life heros that have for so long had their story untold. I will say, though, it was very graphic in parts. It was, after all, a war movie. But the humor and the emotions you felt for the soldiers and their families evened it all out. I highly recommend this movie.",1014595200,18,573,4.314814814814815

While there is comic relief used well at times, the movie will keep all on the edge of their seats. I am glad to know that these men's story will finally be told to America.

1726812,4,B000068TSI,"The hits just keep coming when it comes to Mel Gibson. I'm a big fan of his work and this is just another fine addition.

Mel Gibson plays another real life hero in Lt. Col. Hal Moore, US Army. The Vietnam War remains one of the most controversial conflicts that the US military has been involved in its storied history, but in this movie, the controversy takes a back seat to the heroism of the men who fought a war that their country had told them to. These brave men of the US Army's 7th Air Cavalry fought, died and those fortunate to survive in the Ia Drang Valley of South Vietnam had their story told on paper and thanks to the involvement of Mel Gibson, that story comes to life.

The training of the men involved in the months before the attack to their eventually deployment after the many months after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution is told here as well as the principal three days of battle as well. As well as the life of Colonel Moore and his family. Mel Gibson plays a reserved and devout family man who is wise and strong on the battlefield with his men. Truly Mel has done a great job in playing dozens of heroes before. The fact that its a real person he's portraying only adds to it.

But there is also another really good story told on the part of actress Madeleine Stowe who plays Julie Moore, the colonel's devoted wife. A sort of homefront storyline in which she takes command of the military wives doing basic things as in taking care of their needs in the absence of their husbands but probably the best scene in which she takes it upon herself to notify them of tragedy in the Army's callous indifference.

The acting is phenomenal and the action is brutal and true to life. Heroism can be told without silly propaganda and that's what is seen here, with respect and honesty. Mel Gibson, Madeleine Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Chris Klein, Keri Russell and so many others make a powerful movie. So much has been made about Vietnam's controversy, but its great to finally see a movie of the men who fought it with dignity.

Truly a great movie.",1517529600,,2072,4.4136125654450264

1727006,4,B000068TSI,"Well it is Mel all right; he started getting gung ho with whit ""Brave heart"" hand has been gearing up ever since. The only problem I have with this movie is I can not figure out what he has to say even when he tells you. With the probable exception of ""All Quiet on the Western front"", most war movies just use war as a back drop to their main purpose as in ""Apocalypse Now"" (an updated ""Hart of Darkness""). This movie has the look and feel of an updated ""Green Berets"" Pluck out John Wayne and plug in Mel.

We know the base story is of the stand off of the NVA at Ia Drang November 1965 against overwhelming odds, with a little help of superior technology. The uniforms and equipment look pretty authentic. The terrain was well done also; it could be the real thing as much as California. Not all of Vietnam is swamp.

Even though there is a lot of action (more phosphorus than C4) this is not just a shootemup movie. They also focused on the wives back home, showing how they had to cope with the situation. There were also some cursory sub stories as a combat photographer getting more than he expected.

I have the same conundrum as others do that have not been there. The Vietnam I was in (67-68) had a few firefights; but most of the time it was our spies against their spies and there was no front. When we tangled both sides lost an even average of 15% but if you could find them and drop something on them you got your 15% from a safe distance. I was in the special reactionaries and trained for just the situation this movie depicts. I was the RTO and was supposed to fight out and retake the base to not let the NVA get a foot hold. However it never came.

One thing you can say about this movie is that you will get involved and almost forget that it is a movie.",1507248000,5,1775,4.166180758017493

The actors did a good job portraying  what must have been a living hell for the (real) guys on the ground. The army planners didn't cover themselves with glory on this operation and many others during the Vietnam war. Our guys made the best of a situation where they had little control over the outcome.

There is a scene in the film where the NVA commander is discussing the results of the first days combat with his unit commanders. He evaluates the effectiveness of the US artillery, then say something like 'We must get close enough so they cannot use it. We must grab them by the belt buckle, and kick them in the balls!'

The version shown when renting from prime sub-titles the scene as 'We must grab them by the belt buckle.' Period. Same censored version one could see on TBS. I have no idea what else may have been changed before that point, and that's the issue - this is not the theatrical release, and has no credibility.

Sorry, but I paid for this thinking I would see the theatrical version, not Nanny Turner's version.

While it hurts to know these men, under pressure used abusive language, the director attempted to bring to life, the reality of battle. I am too young to have experienced this war, but I would expect, those courageous soldiers who fought, would say this movie sheds light on the reality and replications of the war.

One more note, this film did not destroy the credibility of the Vietnamese soldiers and officers. In fact, it shed light on their desire to fight for what they believed in.

1727345,5,B000068TSI,This is one of my very favorite movies. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot are outstanding. Greg Kinnear shows his acting range. The action scenes are amazing and realistic. The private lives of the soldiers and their spouses are effectively revealed. Particularly effective are the devastating reactions of the wives  and the ineptitude of the Army as telegrams are coldly delivered by taxi. Just enough shorts scenes are intercut to demonstrate how incompetent Army Command was in the early part of the Vietnam War. But most important to the entire story are the scenes of incredible bravery as American soldiers and their commanders fight for their lives. God bless the artillery and the inefficiency of the close ground support and the helicopter crews. Without them this battle this battle would have been a disaster.,1484611200,3,813,5.112781954887218

1727347,4,B000068TSI,"This movie put right there and let me feel, as much as one can feel being a spectator, the conflict of the battle, the conflict of the cause, the conflict of the evolving attitude towards involvement in wars where US resources and financial interest were not in real jeopardy.  it was all summed up in the words of the Vietnamese commander toward the end of the movie.  I wish I could give it five stars but that connotes perfection, and I don't believe perfection is possible.",1484524800,,477,4.534883720930233

1727368,5,B000068TSI,"As a retired sailor from the Vietnam Era I tend to watch a lot of military and war movies.  I've seen this film scores of times.  It never fails to make me sad and leak a little.  It is sad.  The treatment of the American soldier after Vietnam was sad.  The scene where Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe) decides she'll deliver the Department of the Army notices is sad.  The scene where the taxi driver (Danny Beene) delivers an Army notice of death is sad.

There are good parts too.  Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) genuinely cares for his troops.  Gibson makes that show through in spades.  Sgt. Maj. Plumley (Sam Elliott) is Moore's right hand man.  Elliott shows that clearly.  Greg Kinnear plays Major ""Snake"" Crandall, a helo pilot who won't leave a man on the ground but would rather put himself in jeopardy saving him.  Flying 22 missions in an unarmed H-1, Crandall evacuated wounded and delivered ammunition to the ground forces, flying even when the MedEvac choppers refused.

We Were Soldiers is a study in humanity.  It is probably one of the most sensitive war movies I've seen outside Flag of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  This is a serious movie that deserves a greater appreciation than it has.  Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott truly made the best of their respective roles in honoring the soldiers they represented.

I have been undertaking research to the very disturbing but ignored issue of rhe torture of US POWs and the failure of the Russians, Chinese, Cubans and North Vietnamese regimes to fully account for those soldiers classified as MIAs. Worse still is the failure of the USA  Government to place constant pressure on such regimes to honour the agreement to provide such vital information.

You may not like or enjoy war movies, or even support the ravages of war, but this movie is true to Moor's book he wrote about his men...brave and fearless men who were engaged in one of Viet Nam's most lopsided battle that should have been won by the Viet Cong, except his men managed the impossible and defeated 'the perceived enemy.'",1463961600,5,666,4.379032258064516

1727815,5,B000068TSI,This is absolutely the best of all the Viet Nam War films period. Based on the book written by Lt General (Ret.) Hal Moore and Joe Galloway it depicts the first battle between the forces of North Viet Nam and the U.S. Army in the Ia Drang valley in the central highlands of South Viet Nam. Hal Moore was used as a consultant on the film and he indicated it was done right. According to General Moore all the other films about the war were not depicting the events as they truly were but had other agendas. The film depicts both side of the conflict realistically and draws the viewer in to the futility that was the Viet Nam War. There were true heroes on both sides and after the battle and all the casualties (especially to the North Viet Nam army/Viet Cong) the Ia Drang Valley still remained under control of the Army of North Viet Nam.,1455580800,3,840,4.322784810126582

1727856,4,B000068TSI,"Released in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" stars Mel Gibson as Col. Hal Moore who leads the first major battle between Americans and the North Vietnamese Army in The Battle of Ia Drang Valley over four days in mid-November, 1965. Sam Elliott costars as the seasoned NCO and Barry Pepper as a bold photographer while Madeleine Stowe appears as the Colonels wife. Greg Kinnear is also on hand as a helicopter pilot while Keri Russell plays a soldiers wife.

The movie is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once and Young by Col. Moore and the aforementioned photographer, Joe Galloway. As such, We Were Soldiers is a straight-forward realistic depiction of the battle and the first film depiction where Moore claimed Hollywood finally got it right. This reminds me of something someone I know who fought in Nam said: All the other films about the war from the late 70s to late 80s didn't strike him as the way it really was, but after seeing We Were Soldiers he said, Thats the way it was.

Be that as it may, it doesnt make it as good as 1986 ""Platoon"" or 1979s Apocalypse Now. The former is so great because the platoon in the story is a microcosm of many platoons and their experiences throughout the war, which might come across as ""too much"" because the filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame. Incredibly, Platoon fleshes-out no less than a dozen memorable characters with its grunt's-eye view of the conflict while telling a compelling story. By contrast, We Were Soldiers only presents about four memorable characters during the battle and, while its a solid war flick, it simply isn't as compelling.

As for ""Apocalypse Now,"" its useless to compare the two because (1.) the original version of Apocalypse Now (as opposed to the horribly flawed Redux) is a downright cinematic masterpiece; (2.) its way more than just a war movie; and (3.) its theme is deeper than the conventional and patriotic portrayal of the realistic We Were Soldiers. If you're not familiar with the theme of Apocalypse Now, its basically this: Capt. Willard (Sheen) comes face-to-face with two Colonels during his mission up the river to assassinate the rogue Col. Kurtz. Both of the colonels names start with K, which is no accident. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard.

""We Were Soldiers"" instead opts for a simple portrayal of the first major battle of the infamous war and the bravery & horror thereof. The story essentially proposes the question: What would happen if you drop 400 American soldiers into a valley crawling with 4000 soldiers of the NVA? The fighting is presented realistically, brutally and relatively coherently given the chaos of the intense conflict. Col. Moore truly loves his men and Gibson carries the movie with the peripheral help of Elliot and Barry Pepper. On top of this, the movie gives quite a bit of time to North Vietnamese side of the story, which enhances the story.

Some people have rolled their eyes at the Morro Bay locations of central coastal, California, but if you look at Galloways real-life pics of the battle they chose a great stand-in for the grassy valley. I guess people don't realize that Vietnam isn't all conventionally tropical jungle.

The film runs a little overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and was shot in Morro Bay, Pasadena and Fort Hunter Liggett, California; as well as Fort Benning and Columbus, Georgia.

1727968,3,B000068TSI,"Marxists utilize the tactic of employing false oppositions, more commonly referred to by Marxists as the Scissors Strategy, in which the blades represent the two falsely opposed sides that converge on the confused victims, neutralizing true opposition, thereby allowing the advancement of socialism to the bewilderment of the true opposition. Relating to the Vietnam War, and as with all movies that deal with the conflict, in 'We Were Soldiers' you won't be informed that over 50% of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regiments were actually 100% manned by Chinese soldiers attired in NVA uniforms, hence why the United States 'lost' the war. Of course, this means that the political parties of the West conspired to destroy the pre-eminence of the United States in the eyes of the world, where at home in the United States the never-ending war, thanks to Chinese soldier ringers, (1) brought about distrust between the American people and their government; and (2) secured Communist victories in Southeast Asia. Application of the 'Scissors Strategy' during the Vietnam War era witnessed the so-called 'hawks' vs. 'doves' false oppositions. Both communities based their war policy platforms on false precepts, thereby neutralizing closer examination of the war's oddities.

Only Marxists get to produce, direct and act in Hollywood, hence the distorted history. When did Hollywood produce a movie that documented the horrors of the Soviet Union or Communist China? In fact, Warren Beatty's 1981 movie 'Reds' embarrassingly romanticized Lenin & Bolsheviks, receiving rave reviews from the Hollywood establishment. Regarding the Vietnam War, where in John Wayne's Vietnam War movie, 'The Green Berets', were we informed about the Chinese soldiers American boys were fighting? That's one empirical example of the 'Scissors Strategy' tactic in action during the Vietnam War era, where 'hawks' misinformed movie goers.

For those who are ignorant of the above, the next time you meet a Vietnam veteran ask him who else besides the NVA, Viet Cong, Khmer Rouge (Cambodian Communists), and Pathet Lao (Laotian Communists) were United States ground forces fighting in Vietnam. Don't mention the word 'Chinese', however! Allow the veteran to volunteer it.

Notice that not one political party in the West requested verification of the collapse of the USSR, and the media failed to alert your attention to this fact, including the ""alternative"" media. When determining whether the ""former"" USSR is complying with arms control treaties, what does the United States do to confirm compliance? Right, the United States sends into the ""former"" USSR investigative teams to VERIFY compliance, yet when it's the fate of the West that's at stake should the collapse of the USSR be a ruse, what does the United States do to confirm the collapse? Nothing!

The fraudulent collapse of the USSR (and East Bloc) couldn't have been pulled off until both political parties in the United States (and political parties elsewhere in the West) were co-opted by Marxists, which explains why verification of the collapse was never undertaken by the West, such verification being (1) a natural administrative procedure (since the USSR wasn't occupied by Western military forces); and (2) necessary for the survival of the West. Recall President Reagan's favorite phrase, ""Trust, but verify"".

It gets worse--the ""freed"" Soviets and West also never (1) de-Communized the Soviet Armed Forces of its Communist Party officer corps, which was 90% officered by Communist Party members; and (2) arrested/de-mobilized the 6-million vigilantes that assisted the Soviet Union's Ministry of the Interior and police control the populations of the larger cities during the period of ""Perestroika"" (1986-1991)!

There can be no collapse of the USSR (or East Bloc nations) without...

Verification, De-Communization and De-mobilization.

The West never verified the collapse of the USSR because no collapse occurred, since if a real collapse had occurred the West would have verified it, since the survival of the West depends on verification. Conversely, this proves that the political parties of the West were co-opted by Marxists long before the fraudulent collapse of the USSR, since the survival of the West depends on verification.

The above means that the so-called ""War on Terror"" is an operation being carried out by the Marxist co-opted governments of the West in alliance with the USSR and other Communist nations, the purpose being to (1) destroy the prominence of the West in the eyes of the world, where the West is seen (i) invading nations without cause; (ii) causing chaos around the globe; and (iii) killing over one-million civilians and boasting of torture; (2) close off non-Russian supplies of oil for export, thereby increasing the price of oil, the higher price allowing oil exporting Russia to maintain economic stability while she modernizes and increases her military forces; (3) destroy the United States Armed Forces via the never-ending ""War on Terror""; the ultimate purpose of the aforementioned to (4) bring about the demise of the United States in the world, opening up a political void to be filled by a new pan-national entity composed of Europe and Russia (replacing the European Union), a union From the Atlantic to Vladivostok""; which will (5) see the end of NATO.

Now you know how Bolshevik Russia survived in 1917; how the West ""lost"" China to the Communists in 1949; why the Eisenhower administration turned a deaf ear to the anti-Communist Hungarian uprising in 1956; why the Eisenhower administration in 1959 was indifferent to the Castro brothers' Communist fidelity, actually used the CIA to overthrow the Batista government; why the Nixon administration abandoned Taiwan for Communist China, and signed treaties/provided economic aid to the USSR; why the Nixon administration refused to tell the American People that over 50% of North Vietnamese NVA regiments were actually Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers (attired in NVA uniforms, and proving that the Sino/Soviet Split was a ruse, as KGB defector Major Anatoliy Golitsyn told the West back in 1962), thereby (1) ensuring the Vietnam War would be lost; (2) destroying the prominence of the United States abroad and at home; (3) breeding distrust between the American people and their government; and (4) securing Communist victories in Southeast Asia. Working in the background within the political parties of the United States and Great Britain were Marxist agents doing their best to (1) ensure the survival of Communist nations when they popped up; and (2) sabotage any policies that would bring down a Communist nation. That's why after the fake collapses of the East Bloc nations and USSR there was no mandatory Western verification process to ensure the Communists weren't still in control.

Question: When did any Western nation liberate a Marxist nation? Ah, you never thought about that question, huh, and that's because the media/press never directed your attention to the giveaway proof of the West's Marxist co-option, since the answer to the question is the West liberated zero Marxist nations, while doing nothing to prevent their rise.

Conclusion:

The West will form new political parties where candidates are vetted for Marxist ideology, the use of the polygraph to be an important tool for such vetting. Then the West can finally liberate the globe of vanguard Communism.",1440633600,,7446,5.321428571428571

1728090,2,B000068TSI,"One of the worst war films I've ever seen. I am disappointed with Randall Wallace with this piece. Every possible stereotype of soldiers and their families are emphasized. In one scene, a dying soldier cries out,
""Tell my wife... I love her."" And then dies in a pathetic last breath.
In another scene, the soldier kisses his wife on the forehead while she sleeps and then goes off to war, without saying goodbye. Moments later the woman runs into the street with a night gown, half-attempting to catch up to her husband to say goodbye like a decent person, but decides to stop and whisper ""I love you"" into the darkness.
One more thing that pretty much decimated this movie for me were all the 'thinking' scenes. ""What is a thinking seen? You might ask.
Well, I consider such scene a moment where a character, after some event, sits and stares into nothing for three or more seconds as if deeply contemplating what has happened/is happening. I counted over thirteen 'thinking' scenes in this movie.
The only good part of this movie is when the trumpeter gets shot in the throat while he plays his trumpet, at the very beginning of the film. That's probably the only reason this film got two stars instead of just one.",1431388800,3,1217,4.612903225806452

1728153,5,B000068TSI,"Outstanding if not the absolute best movie to ever depict the conflict in Vietnam.  There were no politics in this film, there were no hidden ideological agendas thrown at the audience, there were no preaching or soap box rhetoric, this is simply by far one of the absolute best and most accurate combat movies I have seen.

 I loved the real dramatic portrayal of these remarkable American heroes who served on the front lines of Hell, and I also really liked how the movie brilliantly depicted the North Vietnamese side as well.  We see the Soldiers on all levels, and on both sides as the human beings they were, we have the Privates, the Sergeants, the Specialists, the Colonel, the gallant Sgt. Major played remarkably by actor Sam Neil, the Generals, and a North Vietnamese infantryman looking at a picture of his wife before going into battle.

 This movie is very rated R and not politically correct at all, it depicts the horrors and the brutality of the historical conflict in full graphic detail with remarkable special effects.  We really feel proud and stand tall with Mel Gibson's portrayal as the warrior Hal Moore, leading his men into some of the conflict's worst battles (The Ia Drag Valley).  This is really the only Vietnam film that in my opinion honestly got the historical story right, we have excellent true and accurate depictions of air assault warfare and infantry tactics, with realistic rifleman combat scenes.

  This movie does NOT demonize the Vietnamese for it shows true respect for them, nor does the film demonize America like so many radical extreme Leftists had and still do in terms of how they view this past conflict.  Another example of extreme political jackasses who cannot separate the soldiers from the politicians.  The rational is placed aside so we can live and feel for these brave souls. Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"", NOT that I am writing that it was bad because it also was a good movie, to me seemed really drastically political as if the story of each soldier had been sidelined so he could push his ideological agenda on his audience, as he did with the entertaining but very sly manipulated ridiculous account ""JFK"", Stone set out to create a Vietnam War that lived only inside his Hollywood imagination (& his own radical Left views) but not necessarily the one that actually occurred (for good, or for bad, or for the grey in between history was what it was.)  Others films like ""Full Metal Jacket"" seemed way too dark, while ""Apocalypse Now"" struck me as a really way out there ""other worldly"" version of Vietnam.

 It is very frustrating to watch this movie because it seemed to me that we had numerous bloody battle after battle were little ground was taken from either side, and thus this accordion effect occurred where men hunted each other, shot at, and launched bomb after bomb only to go return to their home operating bases then come back to do it again.  It was very painful to see the tactics relived because you the mature and thinking audience member with a heart and soul know that these were REAL men who suffered and died.

 This movie sticks with the FACTS, and has no axe to grind with anyone except wanting to show to the world what horrors these fine men had gone through.  God bless our Vietnam Veterans, & all I can say too them is thank you.  A+& thumbs way up for Mel Gibson's ""We Were Soldiers"".",1427500800,,3376,4.688135593220339

1728161,4,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers,"" a 2002 film starring Mel Gibson, Madeleine Stowe, Sam Eliot, and Barry Pepper, is the cinematic depiction of a Vietnam War memoir entitled ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young,"" by retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Harold G. (Hal) Moore and former United Press International (UPI) photographer Joseph (Joe) Galloway. This film tells the story of the battle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley of South Vietnam on November  14-17, 1965, in what Moore calls ""the first major engagement between North Vietnamese regular forces and the U.S. Army."" It is a chronicle of how a single battalion of U.S. Army air cavalrymen stood their ground and prevailed against an entire division of North Vietnamese regulars.

When Moore's 1st Battalion, 7th Air Cavalry, which is made up of only 395 soldiers,  fly into the Ia Drang Valley - also known as the ""Valley of Death"" - they land at a small, pre-selected clearing called ""Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray."" Unknown to Moore and his men, this clearing is the base camp of an entire division of North Vietnamese army regulars under the command of Lieutenant General Nguyen Huu An. An is itching for a fight with the Americans, and now the Americans have dropped right into his lap.  How Moore's  battalion manages not only to avoid extinction but to gain a victory over An's division is the stunning climactic event of this film.

At the height of the battle, a civilian arrives on a helicopter ferrying supplies to Moore's beleaguered troops. He is Joseph Galloway (played by Barry Pepper) a UPI photographer who wants to take pictures of this first battle between the North Vietnamese and American armies. At first, Moore and his command Sergeant Major are skeptical of  the noncombatant Galloway's presence on the battlefield. As the battle intensifies and the American position is threatened with extinction, Galloway finds himself forced to put down his camera and pick up a weapon...

Writer/Director Randall Wallace portrays the events of November 15-17, 1965 with skill, accuracy, and realism. As the battle of LZ X-Ray unfolded on-screen, I felt like I was being fully immersed in the blood, dust, smoke, and stink of the fight.

The acting in ""We Were Soldiers"" is very good. Mel Gibson, Sam Eliot, Barry Pepper, and Madeleine Stowe all are all simply terrific.  Stowe's performance as Mrs. Moore is particularly noteworthy, especially  in the scenes where she voluntarily delivers official death notification telegrams to newly created war widows.

""We Were Soldiers""  is a good but flawed movie.  On occasion, it attempts manipulate viewers with appeals to raw emotionalism, and also occasionally lapses into banal dialogue. On balance, however, it's well written and acted; has high production values; and is very entertaining. Most importantly, it respects and honors all those who so courageously fought in the ""Valley of Death."" Recommended.",1426118400,4,2918,5.11578947368421

1728248,4,B000068TSI,"Great movie depicting the events of the 1st faze of the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. the 2nd faze of the battle, LZ X-Ray was way more devastating to both sides than this movie. This is considered the US Army's first battle during the Vietnam War and it was a nasty one at that. I read the book before watching the movie and both pretty much complimented one another. However, the final American assault upon the North Vietnamese positions near the end of the movie was purely Hollywood - did not happen in reality. Quite impressed how the wife's of the soldiers were portrayed and, especially, their reactions when finding out that their husbands were killed in action - something that is grossly ignored. I think that the women actors were much better than the male actors.

The weapons, tactics, equipment were about as accurate as possible. The patches that the US forces wear throughout the movie are also accurate as to the events being portrayed in the movies. Video comes with deleted scenes and, after viewing most of them, too bad that they were deleted for they would have enhanced the story quite a bit. This is probably one of Mel Gibson's better roles before he had his personality change. Overall, great to see the movie in its entirety and that has not been butchered for TV showings.

I'm not a big fan of Mel Gibson, but he did a wonderful job portraying Hal Moore, as did all the actors chosen. They had big shoes to fill. The Viet Nam vet  bore  the brunt of that unpopular war and I never understood that. I hated the war, as I do all wars, but I loved the warriors. Cudos to Randall Wallace for making, from what all the Viet Nam vets I know have told me, the closest thing to what Viet Nam was really like. He did a masterful job. I don't know how you could watch this movie, and not feel anything but immense pride for our soldiers.  My little town of 588, paid a terrible price for that war when two of ours came home in coffins. I wish all Americans who treated the returning vets so shamefully could see this. Maybe they would understand what an awful thing they did. To all the Viet Nam vets out there, a much belated welcome home, and we love you all.",1405814400,3,956,4.074468085106383

1728724,5,B000068TSI,"A very good friend, who was badly injured in combat in Vietnam strongly recommended this after I'd told him I'd watched ""Apocalypse Now"" and some of the other better known Vietnam movies - and been disappointed with them all.

He also recommended I read the book first (We Were Soldiers Once And Young) first to give the movie more context and background - I did so, over a year ago, and finally got around to watching the movie. It was definitely a good idea to read the book first: Not only does it provide more background to the situation, it also helps in understanding some of the inevitable confusion of battle, and what is going on as battle ranges around the surrounded 7th Calvary.

Never having been in combat, it's tough to judge accuracy of the combat scenes, but I'll go with my friends' judgement that they were the most accurate he'd seen in a movie. As another reviewer said, there are no obvious heroes in the combat scenes here; it's a man-for-man, and buddy-for-buddy fight in the long grass and scrub surrounding an anonymous landing zone somewhere in the Vietnamese North Highlands.

Hal More is represented as a father like (almost god like) figure to his troops; and to me this feels a little over the top at several points during the movie. Given that he was the author of the book, I'm a little suspicious of this representation as too good to be true; but again - I have never met the man, or served under him so I will leave that judgement to others.

Others commented on some of the 'final words' being predictable or unimaginative. I'd disagree - I'd say that in our last few moments, we're all likely to say some pretty basic (and predictable) things, and have messages for our loved ones.

All in all, a great movie - and made even better by having read the book before hand, and having a personal recommendation as to it's generally accurate portrayal of a time and place from someone who was far closer than I.",1401667200,2,1943,4.54

1728727,5,B000068TSI,"Mel Gibson does a great job in this deeply touching film. Perhaps because I served in the Nam, this film brought back memories that have been suppressed for decades. We served at our country's call, often without a choice due to the draft, but most of the country turned its back on us, despised us, and now those of us that are left get to see the opposite treatment of today's vets. Desert Shield/Storm was an effort by some to make up for it, but nothing really can. You don't see many movies about the Nam because it was such an ""unpopular"" war. This one does a great job telling about those of us that served and a little of what we went through, but nothing has really changed in this country. Everyone tells vets ""thank you for your service"", Obama flies to the Stan to ""support"" the troops, but the government he leads turns its back on us. It has voided the contract they made with us, changed the rules, and has made it so difficult to get the services promised to us that most just give up or die waiting. Why is it that Wounded Warriors, the Fisher House and others have to step in to fill the gap and provide what the greatest country on earth promised those that served? With very few exceptions, the community organizer in chief, the Congress and the House have no idea what it means to serve and sacrifice for this country. This movie does a good job of portraying the underlying tone of the politics involved during that war. 58,000 men died in that war for nothing and we as a country have learned nothing. Men are still being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, again for nothing.",1401235200,2,1595,4.391891891891892
1728728,4,B000068TSI,"This movie is based on the book of the same title about the Battle of Ia Drang during the Vietnam War by Lt. Col. Hal Moore and Joe Galloway. It is offers a more accurate portrayal of combat in the Vietnam War as compared to the more metaphorical movies such as APOCALYPSE NOW, FULL METAL JACKET or PLATOON.  WE WERE SOLDIERS concentrates on heroism and sacrifice in Vietnam as opposed to the other aspects (anti-war/demoralized troops, civilian massacres, drugs, corruption,etc.) that are explored in the other Vietnam movies.

Randall Wallace (BRAVEHEART) is the writer/director. Mel Gibson stars as Moore with co-stars Sam Elliott (ROUGH RIDERS), Greg Kinnear (AS GOOD AS IT GETS), Madeleine Stowe (12 MONKEYS), Barry Pepper (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), Keri Russell (THE AMERICANS), Jon Hamm (MAD MEN) and Clark Gregg (IRON MAN). The ill-fated French bugler in the opening scene is Randall Wallace's son.

WE WERE SOLDIERS lacks the stunning and artistic drama of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but it still delivers a very good portrayal of heroism and sacrifice in a very controversial war.

One highlight of the movie that, unfortunately, is only in the deleted scenes is Moore's post-battle meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Gen. William Westmoreland. This scene should have been kept in the movie because it sums up the Johnson Administration's (particularly McNamara) misguided philosophy in Vietnam.

WE WERE SOLDIERS is highly recommended as one of the best, if not the best, Vietnam War movies.",1401062400,7,1511,5.20164609053498

1728731,5,B000068TSI,"As a Vietnam veteran, I've seen most of Hollywood's movies about the war. Without a doubt, this is the most realistic, accurate and compelling of them all. Most of the scenes involving stateside activities were filmed at Fort Benning, Georgia; the combat scenes were filmed at Fort Hunter-Liggett, California. The film was done with the support of Department of the Army as well as Department of Defense. The combat scenes are particularly portrayed accurately, to which I can attest from personal experience. It was filmed under the personal technical supervision of LTG Hal Moore, the author of the book of the same name, and main character in the movie. Even though it was an unpopular war, I think all Americans should watch it from the historical perspective. I highly recommend it.",1401062400,,787,5.015267175572519

It was one of the most moving and impact full stories of the bravery of the American soldier, I have ever read. And, to think these were 18 - 21 year old boys out of high school and college that were sent to serve their country and they performed with bravery and self sacrifice. I still remember as a teen those boys coming back from an unpopular war and not being met with open arms for doing what our government sent them to do.

It is brutally honest with the depiction of a bloody war and yet it is very emotional when you view the scenes of the home front.  Totally captures the time and the place but without the rancor of the anti-Vietnam War rhetoric.

It isn't a propaganda piece either, both sides are portrayed fairly and the communist forces are portrayed as courageous and what we sometimes forget about our enemies, real people too, with loved ones back home.

This is a depiction of one battle in a war that lasted a long time.",1398038400,,646,4.394957983193278

That being said, the film showed the agony and horrible conditions that our boys endured in that hell-hole called Vietnam.

It also depicted what their wives and families experienced here at home while waiting for the mailman; whether he'd be delivering a letter from their soldier or a telegram from the War Department.",1397260800,,584,4.938775510204081

My research into it's authenticity revealed, in an interview with Moore, a majority of the movie is true with very little 'creative license' taken by the producers and director.  This includes the scenes about the wives notifying other wives of the death of their husbands instead of sending a telegram to be delivered by a cab driver.

1728849,2,B000068TSI,"I am giving the movie a generous two stars, perhaps because I have a connection to a disabled Vietnam veteran who once was a soldier and young. I don't know why else I didn't give it one star because this was a simplistic, plotless, corny, and silly film with nearly 90% of it taken up with Civil War-style battle and the remaining part consumed with nothing.

Soldiers who came back from Vietnam, when asked if they had ever killed anyone, often said, ""I don't know."" That's because the enemy was hidden, crafty, experienced. Wearing immaculate khaki uniforms? That is silly beyond belief.

Why Mel didn't get his head shot off was a mystery to me. Just like Custer, he stood up and walked around during the onslaughts in a field that reminded me of southern Wisconsin. Didn't whoever made this bomb ever hear that they fought in a jungle? A bullet even bounced off Mel's shoulder. What a man! In Forrest Gump, Lieutenant Dan had the brains to keep his head down.

Several times we were treated to fake blood splashed on the camera lens. They couldn't have wiped it off and done some reshoots? Oh, this movie is really awful.

Greg Kinnear's coming to the rescue about 1000 times made me laugh. What a pilot. He was more skilled than Sully, the captain who landed the jet in the river in NYC. Silly, laughable, and bogus.

1728866,4,B000068TSI,"The Viet Nam War was ripe pickings for film makers. It was unlike the previous wars with its fuzzier outline and non-existent end game. This is a near unique entry into the genre.

Here's the scoop. Lt. Col. Hal Moore is about to engage in the first open battle between the American troops and the NVA during the Viet Nam conflict. He has studied the strategy (or non-strategy) of the previous French troops and outlines his own strategy for success in the battle. It turns out to be a tougher fight than he had figured on.

This is a very straight forward movie. I don't know how closely it sticks to what actually happened but it sure feels right. And Randall Wallace's efficient and adroit direction, manages to pull that off. It's not as flashy in its visual style as, say, ""Platoon"" but the shots are set up well and the editing is near seamless. It has a more immediate quality to it. Very intense things happen but the intensity id felt by its nature and not by overpowering direction. The acting is generally very good. Gibson does a fine job as does Sam Elliot as the commanding Sergeant. Greg Kinnear is a chopper pilot and I could have used more of him. There are other faces that have gained more credits since this was made. They also take time to visit what happens at home with the wives as they begin receiving death notices of their husbands.

Some complain about the film's political correctness. Nowhere are pejorative terms used in regard to the enemy. I guess that's a valid complaint but it didn't bother me. Also, I took exception to Gibson's remorse at the end that many of his men died and he did not. That didn't ring true to me. It's my opinion that the commander is needed to use his witts so that as few of his men die as possible. Then there are the curious final words of the NVA commander. Being as he was just beaten horribly and lost some 1,800 men, his optimism is curious at best.

1728906,2,B000068TSI,"I have an interest in the history of the Vietnam War and have read the book of military history upon which this novel is supposedly based (that book is ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young,"" by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore and Joseph Galloway). This film presents some historically accurate facts about a really interesting and historically important battle that took place early in the Vietnam War in a region of Vietnam known as the Ia Drang valley. (As a little sidebar, in Oliver Stone's film ""Platoon,"" from 1986, the character Sgt. Elias, played by Willem Dafoe, is a veteran soldier who is on his 3rd tour of duty; one of those tours was with the 1st Cavalry Division Airmobile [aka, ""the Cav""]; this is indicated by a shoulder insignia (or ""flash"") that he wears. The soldiers fighting in the battle that is dramatized in the movie ""We Were Soldiers"" belonged to the Cav [specifically, the soldiers in the film belonged to the 7th Cavalry Regiment -- which historically was the regiment that Custer led at the Little Big Horn. The 7th Cavalry belonged to the 3rd Brigade of the Cav -- the so-called Garryowen Brigade. In the film ""Little Big Man"" [from 1970], there are several scenes in which units of the Garryowen Briade are attacking while a drum and fife band plays the Garryown Song.)

Unfortunately, the film ""We Were Soldiers"" presents only a smattering of the facts of the battle that took is described in detail in Gen. Moore's and Joseph Galloway's book. The film restricts itself to the fight at the base of the Chu Pong Massif (ie, the fight for landing zone X-ray). It ignores all together the disaster that struck US forces the day after the fighting at LZ X-ray, as those forces were marching overland to a position referred to as landing zone Albany. During that overland march, hundreds of US soldiers were overrun by North Vietnamese Army forces. This so-called ""massacre"" is described in detail in the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young.""

Gen. Moore's and Joseph Galloway's book is a great, great book of military history (and, what perhaps is most important, it is a great book of human drama, courage, sacrifice, comradeship, and duty). But the movie ""We Were Soldiers"" doesn't  measure up to the book. And this is regrettable. The events that book place in the Ia Drang valley in November 1965 warrant more (that is, a truly factual presentation, not a fanciful patriotic gesture).",1384473600,3,2414,4.784172661870503

1728910,5,B000068TSI,"This movie is tough to watch, because it's horrible. No, not the quality of the picture, but because of how real it makes war feel.

War is a terrible tragedy, and what this film does is show you what happens when people in armchairs decide they want to fight. They send the boys to go play war and then wonder why they feel so sad when they have to write letters to all of their family members.

This movie does not create any heroes, nor does it create any villains. Just like in real life. We may disagree with the views and opinions of another culture. But when they lay their guns down to rest and go home. They too are returning to wives, children, and families. And you see that in this film. You see who the Vietnamese soldiers care about, and you see who the American soldiers care about, and the films basically makes the two sides appear to be as one. Unfortunately, one side has to lose and there are many, many gruesome deaths in this movie.

What this movie does well, in my opinion, is make you care about the characters. You care about what happens to these boys and their wives. You ask yourself ""was the war really necessary?"" when the battles get gruesome, you wonder how you would react if YOU were to be called to duty. At least I do, and it's heartbreaking. I've never served, but this movie makes me imagine what it could be like. And then after watching this movie you realize... this was just one battle. When it's time for war, these battles happen again and again doing its damndest to kill anyone you may care about.

It also shows you the shame and devastating sadness, of the vietnam vets coming home and having no one to wait for them. No one to hug them and call them heroes.

It's a sad movie, but it's well done and well worth your time to watch it. It won't be easy, but it will make you appreciate the sacrifices the real soldiers have made, so that you could watch this movie from the comfort of your home.",1384300800,,1943,4.297814207650274

The US sent 3 divisions into that valley to prove they did not have a clue on how to run that war.  There was over 60% casualties and I do not call that a win.  I was a Recon Sergeant in Nam 69-70 and we were just cannon fodder to those running the campaign.

However, when Hollywood or Paramount Studios raises its ugly head to sensationalize what the 'War' really was doesn't add to the film credence. Mel Gibson is assigned to portray a family man on the air training base and then, through his script, have to portray a 'Pattonesque' style of leadership during that same training and in the field of battle. With young men dying all around him and his co-star, he manages to escape the onslaught unscathed. This is an acceptable film for the viewers that have little or no knowledge about the Vietnam War. Good attempt, but I don't think this version was based on facts. This is my opinion. I must admit, I did not watch the last 1/4 of the film.

1728964,4,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is an enjoyable Mel Gibson movie which is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once...And Young.  It could be beyond enjoyable-a transcendent study of war-but the movie deviates from the book in several significant ways.  As a result it is more of a pre-Iraq Attack propaganda flick.

Mel Gibson stars as LTC Hal Moore the commander of a squadron of the 7th Cavalry who first battles the North Vietnamese Army using the US Army's Airmobile Tactics as well as heavy fire support in the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.

The film is a bowdlerized version of The Nam, ignoring the important realities of the war as well as the critical study of the political limitations at the start of escalation that so warped the American effort.  The book is far more frank of this reality.

The film also pays surprising homage to contemporary America's civil religion of ""diversity.""  Of course, racial tension nearly crippled the US Army in Vietnam and may have contributed to the ultimate defeat of American objectives therein.  This un-necessary but included inversion of reality seems to stem from the current of deliberate denial of diversity's problems that was a major part of the Bush Administration's actions following 9-11.

The film also ignores the remainder of the Battle at Ia Drang-in particular the devastating ambush at LZ Albany.

Of course, it is only a movie and there are great parts to it.  It does highlight the valor of the Americans in Vietnam, it shows the home front, and the necessary building of trust necessary for successful operations.  Superb acting, casting, wardrobe and set.",1381968000,,1610,4.900369003690037

1728988,5,B000068TSI,"The need for a movie to simplify and proceed at a fast pace forces the film maker to make choices regarding ""the truth"" versus the depiction of it.  Having seen the movie, then read the book and then once again viewed the movie now several years later I found the film maker's choices to be good ones.  It captures the essence of the leader, of the events and of the terrible cost of that particular war--perhaps of all wars.

One particular element that tends to be ignored or glossed over in many war movies is that of the interactions among the families of the soldiers/sailors, who in many ways are fighting ""wars"" of their own -- family finances, family health, job pressures and isolation.  Without spending a lot of screen time on it, the movie provides a realistic look at that often unmentioned aspect of the totality of the conflict; and it also shows that the spouses of the officers have responsibilities that in many ways mimic the responsibilities of the officers themselves.

A final comment on realistic elements -- ceremony is an important part of military life.  The ceremonies (of several types) are only briefly depicted, and not all of them involve more than two people; but again even the brief clips provide the viewer a sense of what a soldier (or sailor, Marine, airman) experience in the totality of preparing for and heading off to the war-fighting effort.",1379980800,,1383,4.741666666666666

It's not about heroics, though the actions of many troops depicted quite naturally seem heroic.  This movie is about the so-called ""brotherhood in arms"".  Mel Gibson is a fine actor.  Whatever demons in his own life he is dealing with seem to come out in films he's in.  See ""The Patriot"", for example.  Kinda similar but for the vast gulf of years between the two conflicts depicted.  Sam Elliot is a natural for the role of the gruff and consistently loyal Sergeant Major Plumly.  I'm mystified by the favorable opinions of that dreadful ""Pearl Harbor"" atrocity.  Please read your history, movie fans.  That movie has no place in comparison with better, more accurate films such as this one.  The horrid insertion of fighter pilots manning one of the Doolittle Raid bombers is so irresponsible that no serious historian, whether academic or hobbyist, should mention it under any circumstance.

1729032,2,B000068TSI,"Should have been called ""When We Were Stupid""

Basically a re-telling of a true battle from the beginnings of the war in 65, but with much borrowed from Dien Bien Phu, this was an utterly wasted opportunity to tell part of the tragedy of Vietnam.

The first hour is thoroughly awful, showing the domestic bliss of the soldiers, most of whom are indistinguishable from each other, especially when compared to the sharply drawn characters of Platoon. Later, when they die, you don't care.

The battle sequences are very realistic and gory, but so confusingly shot that it all flattens out. Yes war is chaos, but editing shouldn't be. The director is in way over his head. If a soldier gets a line of dialogue, he is pretty much dead within a couple of beats. It's so predictable.

The writer needed a director, and the director needed a writer. Unfortunately, they were both the same guy, Randall Wallace, the guy who wrote Braveheart. Should have known his limitations. The script is brutal. With such good source material, how is that possible?

Gibson is decent as the naif colonel, the victim of a totally unedited script (notwithstanding an American accent that wanders constantly).

Two more points that are the responsibility of the producers and director collectively.

The story is set in the central highlands of Vietnam, not the jungles we are used to from many other Vietnam films. The problem, as historically accurate as this may be, the location looks like Griffith park. It's impossible to imagine the soldiers in peril in this setting. Nobody noticed this (or perhaps the stones to mention it) but it really hurts the film.

The film focuses on over-selling the courage of the soldiers, which no one is contesting. Cutting back and forth to the VietCong point of view is one of the more successful devices. But the tragedy, which is where the story is, is in the soldiers being sent into indefensible terrain, and surrounded, then, after hundreds of deaths, they realize ""Oh! We can bomb the crap out of the surrounding mountains and kill all the Charlies that way!""

The whole battle was conducted backwards, and the interesting story is of the idiots back in Saigon or wherever who planned the mission, or once they realized they were up against a much larger enemy force than they anticipated, no one made any tactical adjustments.

The behavior of some of the soldiers is just so dumb. Yeah it was the beginning of Vietnam and we had much to learn, but trust me, anyone whose seen three cowboy and indian movies knows you don't take your whole platoon running after one guy, shouting all the while ""get him!"" ""get him!"" My kid knew it was a trap.

I liked Braveheart, overwrought as it was, but this is a mess. Wallace needed to quit while he was ahead. Not recommended.",1376697600,,2789,4.753623188405797

1729037,4,B000068TSI,"Here's what I like. It's determinedly anti-intellectual.  I don't mean it's stupid. I mean it's not clever or sophisticated. It's not supposed to be.  It doesn't attempt to justify or explain anything. It serves no political propaganda cause. It doesn't try to validate or contradict anyone's political views or opinions about war.  It simply depicts as best it can what happened to some men -- citizen soldiers -- who were called the day after they were peacefully barbecuing in their backyard to fight other soldiers on the other side of the Earth, for no obviously good reason except duty, and how it went.  This includes the families waiting at home for the outcome -- not whether we won or lost, for that is irrelevant to them, but whether or not their husband, father, or son, was dead. This thing came crashing in to devastate their lives. Soldier and wife sharing their fate each in their own way.

At the end in the aftermath, there's the nice little encounter with the press who remind me of the Washingtonians who came out to picnic while watching the Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) during our Civil War.  Jackass intellectuals, one and all, as they remain today. I found the actual battle scenes somewhat tedious and confusing at times, but that's probably commensurate with how it actually goes.  And it underscores the ebb-and-flow of the armies' encounter as well as the stark contrast to the life our men had just left and which their families still lived.

Sam Elliott as the Crusty Veteran Sarge was hackneyed casting and no surprise.  But it's hard to imagine another big-name star disappear into the role of no-nonsense, no-Hollywood Hal Moore as well as Gibson.  (Well, Harrison Ford could have).  He manages to not be charismatic while being heroic due to the character, not persona, of the man he's portraying.  He does it imperfectly with the ""Gibson is acting"" apparent at times, but usually he's low-key and sincere and therefore convincing.  He plays it flat, and I give him great credit for that no matter his other failings as an actor.  As I do Stowe as his wife, who's beauty is apparent but who manages to be heroic in character and deed like her husband.  She is strong and a leader, a wonderful copy of Moore.

Realistic? I don't know and don't much care, within bounds.  It must have been something like that, and that's enough.  I can't imagine many women liking this.  Some men would find it lacks glitz and fails to look like a comic book.  Others will find it fails to make ""statements"" about the Vietnam War, war in general, the US policies, bla bla bla, and will therefore find it unintellectual.  Good.

1729041,4,B000068TSI,"I have watched this movie several times for a few reasons that include the strong brotherhood representation that is so critical to our warriors, sailors, airmen/women, coast guard, cops and firefighters. The inclusion of the wives/girlfriends and their emotional gut wrenching roller coaster ride of terror, grief, hope, lose and the fear of the unknown. The story also includes a look into the eyes, hearts and minds of the enemy in a way that is seldom done and is viewed from a human perspective instead of a non or sub human perspective.
I also like to watch this because its so well made from every angle and after some investigation I found the story to be more factual than not and without the all to familiar over the top hollywood BS. I'm sure that some of the hollyweird junk did make its way into the movie, but again to a lesser degree.
It always pulls at my heart strings when I watch this movie  and when I watch them fly away from that battlefield and the NVA return after all the bloodshed I keep asking WHY? I know the answer, but I don't like it. The engagement was a test for a new unproven style of fighting tactics and as a test to size up the enemy and its capabilities.
The movie does a good job of giving you get an idea (but from the safety of your home) of the intensity, confusion, fear, tension (and the list is much to long to post here) and the feeling of impending doom of being overrun that they were going through, albeit a little tension and a quickend pulse rate. The movie can't test the viewers metal to see if you can handle war or succumb to the horrific and tramatic effects it has on the mind and body, but it can and does give the viewer a glimpse into the chaos that is unfolding all around you. I like war movies for some of the previously mentioned reasons and in part because of my age and growing up with so many of them that involved the Revolutionary war, The Alamo, American Indian wars, The Civil war, The Spanish American war, WWI and WWII, the Korean war and the Vietnam war, Granada, Desert Storm (Iraq I), Iraq II and the Afganistan wars.
When I was growing up the wars were glamorized and romanticized until the Vietnam war and its polarizing effects that led to our countries disgraceful treatment of our Vietnam Vets. This is one person that was sicken by the treatment of the guys (girls) I knew and the many many many more that I didn't know. Thankfully my dad was a WWII Vet and he and my mom taught me better than that. They taught me that whether you are for or against any war that you support those who will lay down their lives for this country!!! Sorry for the rant, but its close to my heart.
If you are looking for a closer to the truth or factual war movie (Vietnam) that is incredably well produced that delves into tactics, comraderie, wives perspective, helicopters, napalm, air strikes, survival and a whole lot more?

1729064,4,B000068TSI,"When Mel Gibson isn't spewing out anti-Semitic slurs, he's been in some decent movies, and this is one of them. Focused on the first major encounter between U.S. troops and the North Vietnamese, in the Ia Drang valley, the movie gives more attention to the home fronts than is typical. Going beyond the standard Hollywood romantic scenes, it shows some of the toil that war takes on those left behind, and even has a brief acknowledgement that African American soldiers were fighting for their country in Asia while being denied civil rights at home.
The movie also puts some human face on the North Vietnamese, although they mostly get mowed down by the vastly superior American firepower. The NVA had a huge numerical advantage, though, putting the 7th Cavalry units in dire straits for two days (there was more action in the Ia Drang, where Americans fared very poorly, but that's not depicted in the film). The battle scenes are well done, and the recreation of the close artillery and air support is extremely good.
If you like war flicks and don't mind movies featuring Mel Gibson, this is worth seeing. More straightforward than classic Vietnam films--Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon--more jingoistic than the latter two, but a little more realistic view of the North Vietnamese then most others.",1372982400,,1308,4.9771689497716896

1729094,5,B000068TSI,"Exceptional. Very realistic.

Be advised: Lots of killing in a film about a real battle where many brave men - on both sides - were killed. Grueling and hard to watch at times, due to the sheer gruesomeness of the battle scenes.

This movie truly seems to capture the horror and utter chaos of this historic battle of the Viet Nam war. There is actually real film available from this battle, as well as the best-selling book, not to mention those brave men who were there and lived to tell about it. This film seems to be a reasonably faithful version of what really happened - at least from the American standpoint.

So, if you think this is just a valentine to the American military with little basis in fact, you are mistaken, as the VC are portrayed as courageous and competent fighters. Truth is stranger than fiction, and no make-believe Hollywood story has anything on We Were Soldiers. This fight really took place, with both sides taking extremely heavy losses.

Yes, it is quite gory, but certainly no less so than the actual battle must have been. With so many bullets and bombs flying around in such close quarters, it had to have been hell on earth.

These men were astoundingly brave and their story deserves to be told. Such amazing courage needs to be remembered, and such profound sacrifice should not be sugarcoated.

I honestly cannot fathom why any viewer would give this film less than three stars. Perhaps some people are just so opposed to violence in general, or the Viet Nam war in particular, that they dislike any film portraying our military in an even a vaguely honorable light. I personally feel the war was a waste, yet I still think the world of those men and women who were brave enough to go and fight it, not because they wanted to, but because they had to. To any and all remaining survivors of this battle, you have my utmost admiration.

A truly emotional film. A real story that every American interested in history should be made aware of.",1368835200,2,1979,4.589235127478753

1729120,5,B000068TSI,"Randall Walllace directs a very different view of the vietnam war. This vision of war is one of the most realistic and chilling ever put on screen. We Were Soldiers depicts war in a very unflattering and extremely ugly way. There is also a realism to the entire story and battle footage that is hard to ignore. We Were Soldiers has an ""in your face"" realism that somehow cannot be matched by other films about war. There is more we see here as to how the families of these men are handling the days and nights never knowing when or if their men will return home. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the film as our soldiers and their families hear the news that they will be going to Vietnam in just days, and how they react to the realities of it. The commanding officer played by Mel Gibson gives a final speech to his platoon as family members sit nearby in the grandstand. It's a moment that seems extremely realistic script wise, and well detailed in a simple yet realistic manner. Just following is one of my favorite moments in the film, as Gibson's character kisses his wife goodbye, then heads out late in the night with rifle and dufflebag and ends up standing alone in an empty field as the music builds a dramatic and unsettling tone. Then out of the shadows more men arrive, then hundreds, then dozens of buses. It's a powerful moment that forces the audience to feel the unsettling nervous atmosphere as well. It is like the film is saying ""Well audience, your not just going to watch a movie, your gonna get on this bus and you are going to Vietnam"". What is to follow is some of the most realistic, harrowing, and brutal war footage ever filmed and it is astonishing! There is no other war film like We Were Soldiers. It's not there to try to be cinematic or blockbusting. It's there to be as unflattering and brutally honest as possible, and I for one think Randall Wallace and crew deffinately got the the message across with no problem...""War is truly hell.""",1368144000,3,1979,4.484764542936288

While as an action combat movie, it was very well done, we see the horrific injuries during this very short period, but not the aftermath of injuries that essentially destroyed the soldiers ability to function afterwards.
I have watched the movie more than once but it is difficult to watch the movie on multiple occasions and, cope with the injuries and diseases, be gung ho in reference to the great good that we were told we were doing and realize that it was for nothing.
When I taught my kinder to drive, I emphasized that once they start a turn, not to stop suddenly and end up getting broadsided. Make your determination and follow through period. If the war was truly necessary, then it should have been fought with all the stops pulled out.

It is excessively grainy and gritty, and does not have the level of detail that one normally expects from a blu-ray.  The colors are strong in the nighttime scenes, but the daytime shots look washed out at times.  I am not a sound expert, but the battle sounds were realistic enough for me, so no problems there.  It is a shame this picture was not given better treatment, because it is a good movie.

My four-star rating is for the movie.  The blu-ray transfer by itself would only get two stars.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, sadly, you will probably want to pass on this one.  Perhaps the studio will remaster it and do a better job sometime in the future.",1359504000,2,807,4.4353741496598635

1729270,4,B000068TSI,"This is my very first time writing a review for any movie. After watching this movie, it bring back some memories of my experience as a child born in Saigon, Vietnam. Even thought I have never seen any actions regarding the Vietnam war my self. I've only experienced it through my mother's story and some history books. I was less than a year old when my father die fighting for the South Vietnamese government.
Watching the part about the American soldier wives being notify about their husband was kill in action, bring me to tears. Now I can understand what my mother went through when she got the news that her husband was kill in action, and left with 4 children to raise on her own. Most American now think that the Vietnam War was a loss cause and we have should have no business being there. Think about it, the North Vietnamese only want to fight to win their independent from the French, not to invade any countries. Ho Chi Minh did went to the Geneva Convention and try to convince the US and the world to get support for Vietnam's independent from the French. The US was France ally, so we veto with a "" NO "". We now know how that decision turn out. 536,100 soldiers sent to war, 58,220 die, 303,644 wounded. From the North Vietnamese side, more than 1 million solders dies, 1.7 millions wounded, 4 millions Vietnamese civilian casualties. I think every American and politicians should watch this movie before their send our American soldiers to any war in the future.
Have the US learn our listen from the Vietnam War? Obviously not! The Iraq War, 4,800 soldiers die, wounded 33,184, 600,000 Iraq civilian casualties and cost 2.6 Trillions US dollars, and this does not include the NATO tropps.
The Afghanistan War, 2,000 soldiers die, 17,000 wounded and this does not include the NATO troops, cost 1.4 Trillion US dollars. Is all the American lives worth the cost for American's corporations that supply to the US military?
With the War War II, I understand why the reason we all are fighting for. W W II was a war with a very good cause...to get rid of Hitler. Now, are the US just fighting to prove that we are the all mighty and the powerful people of the planet earth? Ask yourself, are we going to fight and kill each other until the extinction of all human kinds? I'm sure the animal kingdom will love this idea...because their all know that they will all live in peace when human are all extinct.

1729291,3,B000068TSI,"I truly felt PLATOON is much more believable.  Im sure the battles where just like what I saw on WE WERE SOLDIERS, its the other things I don't really like about it.  For example:

-the reporter guy getting in the battle and he kept talking to the Major (Mel Gibson), I think the Major has MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO!!!!
-the reporter guy acted like he was an expert in battles after the battle was over, that's kinda lame!!!
-In PLATOON, it wasn't all about religion, it was about staying alive.  Im WE WERE SOLDIERS, there was way too much of guys giving eachother loving/caring looks and religious talk
-I doubt in battle its a good idea to not stay down, the Sargent Major stood up the ENTIRE TIME!!!!!  and nobody shot him, WOW is that luck or just dumb Hollywood crap???

  In summary, it was a good battle scene and it spoke about families back home and death but I liked PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET better when it comes to Veatnam War movies.",1359072000,,953,4.405714285714286

1729312,4,B000068TSI,"I've seen ""We Were Soldiers"" quite a few times and actually watched it again yesterday. At the time this movie came out 9/11 was still fresh in the minds of the American people an a lot of these ""American Hero"" war movies started flooding the theaters. I like we were soldiers as a war flick but it also suffers from lacking realism. It's somehow a portrayal of realistic events with a non realistic story line. It's obvious certain things were ""Hollywoodized"" in the film to give the movie a sense of glamor but it made the movie feel cheap in certain places where it wasn't needed.

The movie starts out following Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore who undertakes the responsibility of bringing troops to the first battle US Army battle in the Vietnam war. Before any of the soldiers arrive you get to see how they live before hand. They all live picture perfect lives in on base Military neighborhoods. They are all family men and dedicated to their wives,children and their country. I honestly could not stand this part about the movie. It's too whitebread and an unrealistic portrayal of actual soldiers, even in that era. Army bases are made up of people from all walks of life and they all have their reasons for joining. It's a very diverse place but there is a strong bond of comradely because everyone is there to serve the same purpose. You never get to see that part of military life because you're only shown their personal lives from the point of the ""Army wives"" really. It makes the impact of really understanding the battle hard because your not connected to the personal stories of the soldiers. Their backgrounds are either never introduced so there's no real reason to feel for them if they are killed or their background has been hollywoodized into the ""Great American Hero"" story. In a film that's supposed to bring impact about what these soldiers went through it's hard to connect with them without knowing who they are so you can relate to them and that's very important to establish in any war movie. Instead of seeing a group of soldiers that have come to know and bond with their platoon so they have each others backs during war, you just see soldiers and faces you hardly know. It makes certain scenes seemed forced or out of place when someone risks their lives to save someone like their best friends but you never even heard the soldiers name before. Something always put me off about this movie and that was pretty much it. It's a Vietnam movie based half about the lives of the soldiers, and then the war and their sacrifice. But, the first have maybe only the lives of 2 soldiers are ever presented. What about the others that don't live in houses and have a wife and kids? (Of course their story is told at the end of the movie, the people that come home to no one there to greet them"").

I do think the movie despite that issue does give a good emotional insight to how the army wives felt finding out that their husbands had been killed at war. Although I found Lt. Col Hal's wife and her friends good deeds to be mostly out of their own selfishness more than anything.  The battle portions of the movie of course try to add shock value and throw drama on you as much as it possibly can. However, it suffers from the ""Invincible Hard-ss"" syndrome. Where top ranking men can walk through bullet fire and not even have to worry about ""carrying rifle"" or ""ducking"" to avoid fire. It's almost as if through the movie Mel Gibson's character has somehow figured a way to have bullets bounce off of him, as he doesn't seem to feel a need to duck,dodge, or try to avoid anyone's fire at all. Although his role is acted well, it takes away from that realistic aspect that the movie is trying to bring where in one movie soldiers are dying left and right and then in the next scene bullets just seem to bounce right off of one man. I don't care if you're Chuck Norris himself, if someone is firing a 50 caliber machine gun at you, YOU ARE going to duck for cover.

The other problem with the combat is that the movie makes it seem like the Vietnamese army just popped out the ground and started charging at people Civil war style. The Vietnamese were not that sloppy and knew how to make good use of Guerrilla warfare. Their ability to sneak up on their enemy and overwhelm them was their greatest strength. The movie doesn't go into much detail at all about that but just shows swarms of Vietnamese running out the ground like ants and into American rifles. Some points of the movie show their war tactics well like when Mel Gibson's character tells his men to fire 3 shots at anything they thing is strange and then they squad fires and all of a sudden out of know where you see all these Vietnamese troops rising out the ground. That was very good scene.

Overall the movie is about a 3/5 when it comes to a war movie. I just never could adopt to the idea of a ""Realistic"" war movie that's been ""hollywoodized"". ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are also films that suffered from that effect.

What I loved the most about this film were the choppers. The Hueys really steal the show and this is the first movie I've ever seen that showed the true importance of their support in the war. They are literally the lifeline for these soldiers. I always loved the Huey and every scene they have in the movie is like heaven to watch. The scenes with them are amazing, especially the scene where Snake flies in and delivers his personal thoughts to the Vietnamese via, his machine guns. There's just something about the Huey that's amazing. There is one thing I wanted to note about the film, and that's that no one ever has a reaction to the wind from the propeller force of the Huey. If you've ever been on a huey or right up on a huey when it's taking off than you don't know. It's almost like a tornado it blows wind and kicks up anything around it pretty hard. I found some scenes funny when the helicopter would land and Mel Gibson would just be standing without so much as his jacket even waving in the wind.",1355788800,,6040,4.436936936936937

In ""We Were Soldiers,"" director Randall Wallace presents a careful recreation of the initial phase of the battle of La Drang, the first major clash in Vietnam between American troops and those of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). It's the harrowing story of a vastly outnumbered and green 7th Cavalry unit choppered into the field on what quickly becomes a suicide mission.

They engage an enemy with 20 years fighting experience that also has the geographical advantage of high ground entrenchment. Reporter/fotog Joe Galloway choppers in just before the worst fighting begins and ends up battling for his life.

On 11/15/65, Col. Moore (Gibson) radios a ""Broken Arrow"" distress call when his troops are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and it looks like they'll all get slaughtered just as French forces were a decade earlier. The American response is immediate and decisive. Machine gun fire from helicopter warships in co-ordination with accurate artillery barrages turn the tide of battle and decimate the NVA.

This most graphic of all 'Nam films has a solid hour of horrendous battles that intercut occasionally with scenes of the pressures wives back home must cope with. ""We Were Soldiers"" is brilliant, bloody, tragic and definitely NOT for the squeamish!

1729333,5,B000068TSI,"Having previously read the book ""We were Soldiers Once...And Young"" twice, I missed the movie in theaters, but finally bought the DVD. The story is solid. The fictional liberties it takes move the story along very nicely and having the wives on the homefront as a major part of the story was inspired. In the end, the story is less about the violence of the action that about the brotherhood shown by the men and the sisterhood displayed by their wives. Highly impressive are the measures taken by the director to get the look, feel, and sound of combat just right. It is a strange phenomenon, but after I got to Vietnam in late 1966 as a young naval officer, when I look back on my rather limited experience in artillery exchanges was that I don't remember the sound, although it must have been tremendous (I spent twenty of my forty months there on the gunline, mostly in Quang Tri province (I Corps)). What has stayed with me is the visual aspect of combat. I wonder if not a few of these brave soldiers had the same experience. The is a ""keeper movie"" with one proviso - there is an overwhelming sense of sadness that takes hold near the end of the battle. It is a shame that the movie could not do justice to the aftermath when Westmorland, and others in American higher levels of authority, learned the wrong lessons and thought they could win the battle of attrition. Hal Moore made that clear in the book.",1351382400,,1413,4.48062015503876

1729336,2,B000068TSI,"I'm sure my opinion won't be popular here but I can't lie.  I wanted to like this movie, and I wasn't expecting a lot.  Mel Gibson is a great actor but he couldn't carry this film by himself.  There were a few moments that I thought were well done but for the most part it was canned feel-good war porn for baby boomers.  I guess I tend to be a little overly critical, but I couldn't help noticing things like how literally all of the soldiers except for the token black guy were white.  But the token black guy's wife got to make a little speech acknowledging racism, so I guess they covered that base.  And the movie went out of its way to touch on all the excuses for the American failure in Vietnam so it could still glorify the noble American soldiers.  I just found it hard to stomach stuff like the guy who said he wanted to help orphans, not make them to which Mel's response was to pray to God to help them ""blow up those heathen bastards"".  And then he tells his daughter that war is when he has to go stop bad men from killing people.  I thought those scenes made him look like a two-faced sociopath but the movie continues to treat him like a heroic figure.

The other actors' performances were mostly forgettable, although I have to admit that some of the scenes probably lost a lot of their impact from having been done to death, and done much better in other movies just like this one.  And a lot of the gore seems just thrown in for shock value, I mean how many times do we have to watch body parts exploding in slow motion accompanied by inspirational music?  The bad guys in this film, meaning the politicians and the vietnamese, were one-dimensional caricatures.  I don't need for a movie to be historically accurate or morally responsible to enjoy it, but halfway through this film I wanted it to be done and I kept saying ""seriously?""",1348963200,,1855,4.3420289855072465

1729338,5,B000068TSI,"a really moving and heartfelt war movie ,sypathetic to both sides in the vietnam war , and at the end a film that is powerfully for  our  simple and basic humanity.
  However the moment the credits begin we are given the names of the soldiers who died during the battle this film is based on, and as a result 79 names are flashed on so fast it is hard to read even one of them,
  i feel this is a huge insult to the lives of those real individuals whose story we have experienced some part of.  whats worse is that after the split seconds devoted to those men who gave their lives ,  the credits for the actors, producers, special effects technicians  and caterers then unfold at a slow and leisurley pace.
  Generally when we remember those who have fallen in battle we hold a minutes silence... and the mood at the end of this otherwise moving picture cries out for us to reflect on the lives given by some of the people portrayed within it.
  so much so that i rewound and froze each frame of soldiers names and quietly read and reflected about them before i let the rest of the credits roll, it took me about a minute and a half to read each mans name.

1729354,5,B000068TSI,"I'm back with a movie review these reviews have to do with movies that were released in either 1992 or 2002. This is 2002 in film We Were Soldiers. This movie I saw around the same time as Black Hawk Down this mvoie has to do with a different conflict The Vietnam War. We Were Soldiers was directed by Randall Wallace he directed Man In The Iron Mask so I'd say that this is his best film. It stars Mel Gibson as Colonel Hal Moore, Sam Elliot as Major Basil Plumley, Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway, Chris Klein as 2nd Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, Greg Kinnar as Major Bruce Crandall or Snake S  h  i  t as he is called. Mark McCracken as Captain Ed Freeman or ""Too Tall"". So the story is simple as this in 1954 The French Army gets owned by The North Vietnameese Army. They show no mercy & slaughter them. So then you go to 1965 where you have US Army Colonel Hal Moore & his family that are going to live on base cause you live on base where ever yu are stationed. Then you are introduced to Major Basil Plumley & he does bring a little comic relief to the movie. You have some of these troops playing base ball & you're introduced to Major Bruce Crandall & he is aruging with his buddy Captain Ed Freeman if he is out or he is safe. Colonel Moore is behind him & he tells him "" I think you're out."" You go throught Colonel Moore trainning the troops & his stuff at home with his wife & kids there's a scene where his daughter asks what is a war. It is a good scene it is emotional where she asks will they take your life too. 1 of his men 2nd Lieutentant Geogheghan's wife had a baby & him & Colonel Moore become fast friends he talks to him about what it's like to a Soldier & Father. Mel Gibson does such a good job with the speech he gives to his men what's going on over here doesn't matter cause over there we are all American Soldiers. Then Moore finds out that The President isn't treating this like a real war. He is also in charge of The 7th Calvery the same unit that Genreal Custer was in charge of. He feels that not declaring a National Emergancy that he is being deprived of some of his best troops. So when you get to Nam Colonel Moore finds out that an American Base has been attacked & he is ordered to go into battle with 400 men into ""The Valley Of Death"" your get a really & I mean really bloody battle. Moore secures the weak areas before The NVA can. You go to the wives perspective where a lot of them start getting letters about their husband's death's. So Major Moore's wife becomes a bearer of bad news for a lot of them. You go to The NVA's perspective as well. At night Moore's forces catch enemy forces by suprise. The next day their still stuck at The LZ. Then you have a Journalist named Joe Galloway come into the picture during a lot of the brutality. Major Plumley hands him a rifle & tells him you ain't no journalist today. Moore & his troops are being overran by the enemy he tells his raidoman to call in a broken arrow meaning air reinforcements. The aircraft napalm the area a lot of NVA guys get BB Q'd but there attacking for every direction Moore's men get Nampalmed in a horrific scene. 1 soldier got burned really bad more than I can describe. I feel something for these guys cause I care about these characters. There's a part where base wants Moore to come back to Saigon for an evaluation Mel Gibson just sells it where he tells them no I will leave no man behind alive or dead they will all come home. You get to the final battle where it is all out & the troops are getting closer to the The NVA's underground tunnel. The NVA have strong set up & it feels like they are fighting for their lives the acting is that good. It looks like Moore is done for but then a helicopter comes in Major Crandall comes through & guns them a down helps them out. Colonel Moore stayed true to his speech that they will all come home. Despite what Mel Gibson has become lately he deserved some kind of award for this performance the scene where he is talking to Joe Galloway he has a breakdown alomost & says why didn't I die instead of my men. After almost a year Moore comes home to his wife & kids. LT Geoghengan's wife gets a letter by Moore's stating that her husband died in service. Then you have an older Hal Moore passing by The Wall as it's known & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot as good as I should've but war movies are harder for me to review. This is just an excellent movie Randall Wallace did a good job directing. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job. Sam Elliot was good, Chris Klein not the best actor he did a fine job in this flick. Barry Pepper did a really good job & Mark McCracken was ok. Everyone else did a very good job too. We Were Soldiers is defintly worth watching an extremly solid movie.",1331683200,,4783,4.146393972012917

Want to feel your hair stand on end? Buy the book by Hal Moore and Joe Galloway.  There's so much more heroism and pathos in that book than you'll ever find in this crummy rah-rah film

The best part about reading the book?  YOU'RE in the book.  Mel Gibson is in the movie.

The movie makers took about 50 pages out of the book (which was written by the commander of the troops and a reporter who had made his way to the LZ against orders) and made some crap film.
You don't see the soldier who played dead while an NVA used his body as a rifle support while shooting at Americans.  In the movie, that guy would have jumped up and killed the NVA soldier with a shoelace.  The book is REAL.  The movie is fiction.

1729364,5,B000068TSI,"When the 7th Cavalry battled North Vietnamese regulars on Nov. 14-15-16, 1965, I was in Vietnam, too. The 1st Infantry Division was my outfit -- I was not involved in the battle or anywhere in the area. But I remember hearing about it at the time. So I could not wait to view this film.

I was not disappointed. Mel Gibson, in his pre-""The Passion of the Christ"" days, when he fell afoul of the Jewish establishment in Hollywood, did a superb job in this war movie which shows us not only what the men on the front lines experience and suffer, but also depicts the anguish their wives and families face, back home, waiting, hoping, and dreading, what they will hear about their loved ones in combat. Gibson stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the companies which become involved in the fierce battle.

The Ia Drang Valley was the first major clash between main-line U.S. troops and North Vietnamese army regulars in the Vietnam War, and it is shown here in all its convincing, bloody awfulness. A friend of mine said she watched this movie before I did, and that she broke down crying before the battle scenes even started, because she was thinking, ""This one's gonna die; that one's gonna die ..."" That's pretty much the way it is. War is like that; it takes the good, the bad and the indifferent. Bullets and artillery shells play no favorites.

And the deaths of U.S. soldiers reverbate back in the U.S., where a stream of taxicab-delivered telegrams from the Army inform wives and children that their men have paid the ultimate sacrifice. The scenes of the young wives of the young men of the 7th Cavalry, first receiving the tragic news, are heart-rending, and are extremely well played.

The final stage of the battle -- when the elements of the 7th Cavalry, overwhelmed and trapped by superior numbers of Vietnamese, radio a ""Broken Arrow"" plea to headquarters -- meaning, ""We are in desperate straits; send all available combat aircraft at once"" -- may be a little too much for those with tender sensibilities. American fighters, bombers and helicopters hem-stitch whole rows of attacking North Vietnamese soldiers with bombs, machine-gun fire and napalm, wiping out hundreds with each new attack. The screams and the sight of very realistic depictions of men on fire and burning to death would shake anyone. In a couple of places, the blood from fatal wounds of men near the camera actually splatters onto the lens itself -- ""cinema verite"" which may not have been planned, but which the director chose to leave in. And plenty of American combat deaths are depicted, too. A young Japanese-American soldier has just finished proudly telling an American reporter on the scene that his son was born that day, when he is hit and burned horribly by napalm.

After the fighting is over, Gibson as Moore tells another officer that he feels ""so ashamed of myself"" because he survived the battle and so many of his men didn't. It's that kind of war movie. It shows how close men can become when they have ""each other's backs"" in armed combat. The survivors can actually feel ashamed, embarrassed, that their buddies died, and they didn't.

This is an excellent war movie. The fact that it includes significant material about the wives and children back home, puts it a notch or two above many others. I highly recommend it.",1324944000,8,3329,4.740932642487047
1729365,5,B000068TSI,"I had seen the movie on tv but at the time didn't realize that I was related to Col. Moore (even though my maiden name was Moore).  We own a blu-ray player so I though I would order a copy.  Big difference in the quality.  The movie is more about him and his personality and the scenes where soldiers are shot are not extremely graphic, which is a plus for some of us female viewers.  Having Sam Elliott in the movie is another plus.",1324944000,,433,4.119047619047619
1729366,2,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers, a true story, deals with the first contact between the North Vietnamese Army and U. S. soldiers.  The U. S. quickly discover they have underestimated the Vietnamese forces and find themselves vastly outnumbered.  Men are cut off from one another, and under the leadership of Mel Gibson's character they must withstand the modern equivalent of Custer's Last Stand.

Part of the grand tradition of Vietnam war movies is edgy, paranoid atmosphere. When watching Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, you get the edgy, I'm-going-to-snap-soon feeling.  Another almost necessary feature of Vietnam movies is questioning the war itself.  One of the most poignant and powerful moments in Full Metal Jacket is the very last scene where the soldiers are marching in the dusk singing the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club.  You can really get into the psyche of that generation and the rage and protest it felt against the war.

We Were Soldiers, on the other hand. does not examine the war or capture that generation's rage against it.  Instead, We Were Soldiers sadly plays like more of a conventional war film.

The movie starts with Gibson training his boys and being a family man.  There is one moment where the men are standing in the woods during training, listening to a radio transmission filled with gunfire.  Gibson comments on the importance of training and that on the battlefield there are no second chances.  The men look appropriately somber.  Then the film moves to Vietnam itself.

The strong points of the film are the battle scenes.  While not wholly accurate (the Vietnamese did not pile up their dead bodies), the battles are realistic, sometimes terribly realistic.  One young soldier gets burnt and his flesh melts.  The rest of the film alternates between the battle and the wives at home getting letters saying their husbands have been killed and how the wives unite together to support those lost.  A reporter comes to the battle and later tells the soldiers' story.

Overall, the film is rather a disappointment.  While I was fairly certain it wouldn't come anywhere near Apocalypse Now, against which all other Vietnam films should be gauged, I was hoping it would capture the uncertainty and constant questioning of why we were in Nam in the first place.

While it is a true story, the  writers could have better captured that generation's attitude toward the war while keeping true to the facts.  Since it details the first encounter, they could have dealt with the soldiers realizing that maybe Vietnam isn't where they're supposed to be at, or get a more accurate shot of trying to figure out just why they're here.

In the end, We Were Soldiers becomes this rather dazzling paradox.  While it remains true to the facts of the story itself, it does not stay true to the political climate of the 1960s, creating this rather bizarre hybrid of accurate journalism as far as the microcosmic level is concerned (the details of the battle itself), but is just flat-out wrong on the macrocosmic level goes (the counterculture's reaction against Vietnam)

In the end, the more patriotism-oriented themes of We Were Soldiers is far better suited to a film dealing with WW II, not Vietnam.

1729369,5,B000068TSI,"The 1st Cavalry pioneered the ""Airmobile"" concept in Vietnam, utilizing helicopter units as their primary means of conducting combat assaults and troop support. The story is based on the actual 1965 Battle of Ia Drang Valley at Landing Zones X-Ray and Albany, documented in the book ""We Were Soldiers Once, and Young"" by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway.  I served with the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 as an Infantryman / Radio Telephone Operator (RTO). This is the only movie of the Vietnam War I've seen that presents things precisely as they were - no exaggeration, no over the top drama....simply a view of reality. I have watched this Randall Wallace movie so many times I know the words by heart.

The casting is superb, with Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. ""Hal"" Moore, Madeline Stowe as his wife, Sam Elliott as Sgt Maj Plumley, Greg Kinnear as Major Bruce Crandall, Barry Pepper as correspondent Joe Galloway and notable others. There are no weak performances by any of the cast.

For any Vietnam Veterans, this movie is a definite Must Watch.

1729380,5,B000068TSI,"Much has been written about this movie here on Amazon and much, much more has been written in other forums on other sites and other publications.  I doubt serious if I will be able to add and significant information to what has already been said.  I can and will only voice my opinion; my personal ""take,"" as to the merits of this film.

First though I must state that I completely ignore the fact that some folks are Mel Gibson fans and think his is a great guy, while other despise him due to his off screen behavior and some of the remarks he has made over the past few years.  I also hate to see this film and these reviews, along with remarks on many of the reviews, being used as a platform to voice opinions over the merits of the Viet Nam war and those who fought in it.

Anyway...I like this film.  I thought it was quite well done.  There have been literally hundreds upon hundreds of war films made throughout the years and only a very few of them actually ""got it.""  Of those few that did get it, even they cannot possibly offer people who have never experienced the actual horror of war even a close or vague feeling of what it is really like.  I will say though that this film is pretty close...as far as it goes.

One of the first things that impressed me was the extremely narrow ""field of vision,"" during the battle scenes.  In battle soldiers are, for the most part, only aware of a very, very small area (their little world) of the actually overall conflict.  This many times consists of only a few yards.  I thought this film depicted that very well...mass confusion, extreme fear...totally alone.

I was also grateful for the makers of the film in that the depicted absolutely perfectly the way the wives and children of the deployed solders were treated upon notification of their husband's deaths as the battle raged.  The Army and our government were completely unprepared for what happened and this aspect of this battle, and indeed, this war was not one of our more shinning moments.  All in all it was disgraceful. I hope and pray that lessons were learned here...although I have my doubts as to this.

There was a bang up job done with the camera work in this film and the script was excellent.  I found nothing to complain about in either of these two areas.

The debate as to the rightness or wrongness of this was has been argued since the first shot was fired and I suspect will still be argued far, far into the future.  Right or wrong has absolutely nothing to do with these brave young men who fought in this particular cornerstone battle.  I would strongly though recommend the reading of the book on which this movie was based,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Were-Soldiers-Once-and-Young-Ia-Drang-the-Battle-That-Changed-the-War-in-Vietnam/dp/034547581X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang - the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam</a>&nbsp;As always, the book was much, much better than the movie.

1729381,5,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is one of those movies that tells a story.  A true story.  A touching and eye opening story.  A story of sacrifice, duty, honor, courage, and most importantly trust and companionship.  At times the ONLY thing these guys had was each other.  This movie does an excellent job at portraying that.

These men are part of the Air Cavalry.  A new division that traded in their horses for choppers.  You really see how hard their job was.  Just think about it.  You're put on a chopper and flown many miles behind enemy lines.  Then you're dropped in a field and told to hold it and wait for reinforcements, which will take about an hour.  You don't know if your position will be overrun and what's worse is you don't know how many enemies you're facing.  It could be 5 guys in a trench or 5,000 in underground tunnels.  And I'll go ahead and tell you, in this movie, it's the later.

Mel Gibson does an excellent job commanding his men.  He cares for them and this forms a bond that is unbreakable.  In fact many of the actors do great jobs.

And who in the world cast this movie? Sam Elliott: here's a guy that in EVERYTHING I've ever seen him in he tries so damn hard to be cool, the man's man, Mr. mysterious, the ""I'll kick your butt at the drop of a hat but when I get around the ladies or my brothers in arms I have a deep soul"" guy, that it comes off looking ridiculous.

In the movie Hair, there's a scene in which the hippy played by Treat Williams dresses up in someone elses army uniform to gain access to an army base.

In ""We Were Soldiers,"" director Randall Wallace presents a careful recreation of the initial phase of the battle of La Drang, the first major clash in Vietnam between American troops and those of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). It's the harrowing story of a vastly outnumbered and green 7th Cavalry unit choppered into the field on what quickly becomes a suicide mission.

They engage an enemy with 20 years fighting experience that also has the geographical advantage of high ground entrenchment. Reporter/fotog Joe Galloway choppers in just before the worst fighting begins and ends up battling for his life.

On 11/15/65, Col. Moore (Gibson) radios a ""Broken Arrow"" distress call when his troops are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and it looks like they'll all get slaughtered just as French forces were a decade earlier. The American response is immediate and decisive. Machine gun fire from helicopter warships in co-ordination with accurate artillery barrages turn the tide of battle and decimate the NVA.

This most graphic of all 'Nam films has a solid hour of horrendous battles that intercut occasionally with scenes of the pressures wives back home must cope with. ""We Were Soldiers"" is brilliant, bloody, tragic and definitely NOT for the squeamish!

1729401,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is an adaptation of the wonderful book ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"". The filmmakers did a good job adapting a very complex battle to a manageable screenplay. I was a bit disappointed that no mention was made of the fight at LZ Albany instead focusing exclusively on LZ X-Ray, but I understand why they did it. I'm sure it was necessary to make it easier to follow on film.

The actors were selected well for the characters. The film work was outstanding. The scenes are confusing where they should be confusing and easy to follow when they should be easy. I loved the way they flashed back and forth between the battle and the wives at home. That was done very different from the book, but it worked well for the screenplay. It was an important part of the story, and the filmmakers managed to convey the extreme emotion. This film is nearly non-stop action after the opening sequence to get to Vietnam. It was important to have a break from the shooting.

All in all, I think this was a very important film. It was true. If anything, the filmmakers underplayed just how savage the battle was.",1297382400,,1119,4.562189054726368

1729412,5,B000068TSI,"Although I was initially hesitant to We Were Soldiers thanks to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson at the helm, I was pleasantly surprised at We Were Soldiers, which is an honest to god thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace butchered impressive ancient warfare with horrendous writing and directing, and I don't even want to think about the horrible abomination known as Pearl Harbor.  Luckily, Randal Wallace learned after all those misfires and created We Were Soldiers, which actually honors the soldiers of The Vietnam War, something no other war film has never really done.  The closest thing?  The Green Berets.  Ugh.  We Were Soldiers is graphic, yes, but as some of the other reviewers can attest, this is what it was really like.  This film succeeds because of this, as it does for Vietnam veterans what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 Veterans.

We Were Soldiers is much different than other war films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.  While the aforementioned movies do more for me personally, We Were Soldiers is much different from those other films as it gives an honest and straight up thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  It strips away most of the the political and tension that went on during the Vietnam War and focuses squarely on the soldiers and the home front.  No other war film before really did an open letter to the soldiers, and for that reason We Were Soldiers is much more superior to say, Platoon.  Even better, it doesn't make the opposing soldiers seem like inhumane monsters either, but it also takes something's viewpoint to determine that, and I'll leave it at that.

The film also reduces Mel Gibson to merely just acting (both Braveheart and Passion of the Christ seem they were made by a sadist, and one was silly and the other was a glorified snuff film), something that seemed to help The Patriot as well (though that had another problematic Director, Roland Emmerich).  Although I initially was reluctant to watch this movie thanks to Mel Gibson (reasons above), he gives a stoic and reserved performance, very in contrast to his wildly silly Braveheart performance.  I also do think after watching some Mel Gibson movies that South Park's charicture of Mel Gibson is juvenile and childish beyond belief, even though I can't argue with South Park's spot on observation of The Passion of the Christ (hated it as a Christian, hate it as an Agnostic).

We Were Soldiers is a dramatization of the Battle of la Drang, based on Hal Moore's account of the battle as written by him.  For the most part, that's pretty much it.  However, We Were Soldiers works because of that, as it gives a sense of what Vietnam war veterans went through.  Another well made part is the home front, which shows what the people at home go through as well.  While I'm not married, I can really sense what it's like when young couples are seperated, and even more what their wives would feel when they learn of the death of their own husbands.  I also liked the feeling of what it is like to tell a young child what war is about, it's no easy feat to explain that to a child.

The battle scenes are extremely well made, and while they have a soundtrack, it adds to the carnage.  They are set in winding fields that add extreme confusion, with high doses of napalm and muzzle attacks.  They sound brutal and amazing, and Wallace's direction adds tension and a sense of instinct that other war films don't have.  This film, like other war films of recent memory, are very violent, with people being burned, people's heads being ripped up by machine guns, and skin sliding off of a soldiers who was doused with napalm.  I do have one problem, and that would be the final charge, as the cheesy voice over ruins that battle.  Luckily.  I really can't find fault in the battle scenes, which are first rate.  I certainly think they did an excellent job at making Vietnam warfare seem very real.

I'll give the last word to the Vietnam veterans who have spoken well about this film.  We Were Soldiers is quite underrated actually, and the critics who found it cheesy really need to have their tastes checked, in my opinion.  It may not quite stake out new grounds, but it's still an open letter to the Vietnam war and leaves out all of the crappy politics.  All that ____ really doesn't matter anyway, and no matter how it happened, people are killed either way.  Why the hell does it matter.  Ah, I'm ranting.  Just check We Were Soldiers out.

But this one was highly recommended to me by some other Nam vets so I gave it a try.  Yes.  They pretty near just about got it right.  Including the parts about cab drivers delivering telegrams to widows who didn't know they were!  I suppose the impact on the soilders' families is a big part of why this movie tells more of the real story than any of the others have.  It's not the usual action/adventure story that others have produced.  Want to get a much better idea of what it was like?  Watch this one.,1271203200,2,685,4.128787878787879

The class viewed both this movie and The Hurt Locker (both based on experiences of journalists who covered the military).  Galloway, the UPI correspondent, who was with Col. Hal Moore and the 7th Calvary during the Ia Drang battles received a Bronze Star with V for his valor in assisting in getting wounded soldiers to helicopters while under enemy fire.  So, Galloway lived it, co-wrote the book with Col. Moore on which the movie was based and kept an eye on the production of the movie.  He says that the movie is 75% accurate and 25% Hollywood, which he believes is the reverse of normal for Hollywood.  The students liked how personal the movie was.  We saw the reality of the taxis delivering telegrams to the families back home.  Joe said that he and Col. Moore decided when writing the book that they wanted two elements not common in most war accounts:  the impact of war on families and some humanization of the enemy.  Galloway and Moore made several trips back to Vietnam and met with the Vietcong generals who had opposed American troops in the Ia Drang Valley.  Unlike The Hurt Locker, the names of the real soldiers were used, and a few of them, including Moore and Galloway, are still living.

I was assigned to the 1/7th Cavalry in April 1966 as a replacement ; therefore I had the honor of knowing and serving with many of the survivors of that battle. They were truly outstanding and brave young men.

I know that movie contents and lengths have to be limited, but I was disappointed that the 2/7th Cavalry wasn't included in their fight at LZ Albany and that Rick Rescorla (who saved many lives on 9-11) wasn't highlighted.  He was truly a military hero in the Ia Drang . A part two should be filmed to show the slaughter of our men after the 1/7th was withdrawn and the valor of these men.

Sam Elliott as the CSM clearly shows what honor and courage is.  Mel Gibson listened to Hal Moore which makes this film so compelling.  An accurate portrayel of courage before the weak began to loose the war that could have been won.  Peace does not come by compromise, it comes when one defeats the other.  Viet Nam today is said to be at peace but it is still a breath taking and heart wrenching land of many seeking freedom somewhere else.

The ""song"" which should be a hymn to all battle deaths, from the parting of the Red Sea to the most recent deaths in Afghanistan, ""...Mansions of the Lord"" should conclude every religious service on every Army post anywhere in the world, be it the Army of Andorra or Turkmenistan.

Also, I hear the Blu-Ray version is excellent so that's tempting to buy.

""We Were Soldiers"" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War.  Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer.

It's  this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not ""Saving Private Ryan.""  The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes. Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an ""excellent"" film.

Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.",1245974400,,1221,4.682242990654205

1729437,3,B000068TSI,"First off let me say that this is one of my favorite war movies of all time. I owned this previously on DVD and I have seen it at least a half dozen times.

PQ - The picture quality on this one was rather disappointing. I don't mind grain and actually prefer if over DNR. However, the image was soft throughout most the picture and quite honestly was only marginally better than my upscaled DVD of this movie. I would say that this and 28 Days are the worst Blu-rays I own in regards to picture quality. Both on Blu-ray only offer a slight upgrade from an upscaled DVD.

AQ -I first knocked one point off for no lossless track. I then knocked a second point off becuase I had to frequently adjust the volume. The action scenes were great and you feel like your in the movie. The dialog during these scenes is suprisingly good as well. The problem is when you go to the non action scenes you can barely hear the dialogue. Hence my one point deduction for this issue. I also knocked another point off for a flaw in the DTS audio track. I noticed towards the end of the movie that I was getting audio spikes. A couple of examples are when Mel Gibson returns home to his wife at the door and when the credits were rolling. I noted that my Pioneer Elite receiver was stating +4 for volume, it would go up for a second or two and then back down. This typically takes place at the begginning of the movie and I know it is encoded within the Blu-ray. I noticed this issue about 3 - 4 times so I was kind and only deducted one star for this issue.

Extras - Basically the same as the DVD release. Nothing really to add here other than the fact they are average in quantity. However, the content on the commentaries and some of the special features are really good.

Overall - If you have the DVD and a good to high-end upscaling DVD player then this is probably not worth an upgrade. However, I highly recommend this movie on Blu-ray or DVD.",1243209600,22,1932,4.227642276422764
1729438,4,B000068TSI,"If you're looking for a good film about Vietnam, this should definitely be on your list. As with most Mel Gibson films, he wants to grab his audience by the heart (Hamelt, Braveheart, etc.). He does his homework, and with the help of Randal Wallace, always pulls if off. It's a true story, of course dramatized, about the first official combat mission in Vietnam by the 7th Air Cav. Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Hal Moore (who is now a retired Army General). There are quite a few emotional moments, but the battlefield action prevents it from becoming the cross-over date flick like Braveheart. However, the sountract is stunning and soul-stirring; and the music from the end credits ""Mansions of the Lord"" was sung at President Reagan's funeral; how much more of an honor can you get?
The only criticisms that I can give are trying to play a bit TOO much for the sympathy card, but after all, Gibson always gives you both barrels, so really can't be faulted. I would have rated it 5 stars except for the extra shmaltz; but without a doubt, I would place it in the top 10 of Vietnam war movies; and an excellent reminder of the men whose names are engraved on the Wall that you'd never connect with had you not viewed the film.

Many were created to make political points by people against the war.  Whatever the  motive of the film makers, the soldiers were treated badly.  The Vietnam conflict may have been politically a mistake, but those who served simply did their duty, most with honor.  It was always  unpardonable to picture our soldiers as villains.

We were soldiers is very unusual among war movies.  First it is based upon the actual experience of the heroes who shed blood and put their lives in danger to serve their country.  Bravo!

The film traces the origin of the air cavalry.  It pictures the training required to make ordinary soldiers into combat troops.  It demonstrates the development of junior leaders.  Training scenes are not only authentic, they are fun.

The battle scenes are realistic and show the danger or being under fire.  The interaction of the commander with the troops is effective and delightful.  The characterization of the command sergeant major reminds me pleasantly of the outstanding sergeants major with whom I have served.

Sure there are hyped up scenes and mis-characterizations, but remember, it was made in Hollywood and Hollywood takes editorial privilege with everything they do.  For those of us who served during that time or had buddies who served and died there, it brings back some awful, heart-wrenching and ugly memories.  I have watched it many times and have never been able to get through it without crying.  For our generation, its was the most painful time.  For those of you who severely criticized the movie, its a movie, okay?  But, it has some very poignant moments that trigger many painful memories for those of us who served with pride during that time and came home without any parades or fanfare only to be spit upon and called murderers.  If you didn't like the movie that's okay, but try to watch it from the perspective of those of us who gave some of the best years of our youth in service to our country.  For many of us, we totally lost the innocence of our youth during those awful years.  For 58,000+ of our brothers-in-arms , they gave their very lives.

He was honest to the character he portrays.  the shortcoming is that there is more, and to be honest the action that followed that of ""LZ XRay"" must also be told.

1729453,5,B000068TSI,"One of the best Vietnam war movies made, ""We Were Soldiers"" features some of the most realistic combat scenes conveying the ""fog of battle"" and horror of combat.  The story development may seem slow at first, but allows some appreciation of the characters involved and the context of the battle.  The action is fast paced, showing the battle from both the North Vietnamese and American points of view, but is broken by the juxtaposition of poignant events on the home front and political machinations in the rear areas.

Mel Gibson is surprisingly exceptional as the gung-ho Colonel Hal Moore, Sam Elliot seems born to the role of the salty Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, and the entire supporting cast does a wonderful job.  The cinematography and special effects go a long way towards recreating the confusing swirl of a battle with ill-defined lines.

The film is perhaps flawed only by its attempts to cover too many social and political issues in the one film; forgivable in the context of creating a story intended as a microcosm of the entire Vietnam War.  This does however, lead to short scenes seemingly out of step with the rest of the film.  Additionally, there are some unrealistic liberties (Killed in Action telegrams arriving home during the first night of battle), but it is simply artistic license required to make the story work.  If you're willing to remember a film has limited time to tell its tale, these flashes into the social, political and personal issues go a long way in back-filling the context of the story and the conflicting emotions and views of the characters.

In the end, this is a movie of war and the people involved, and it is a very good one.  It's a decent translation of the book to film, and the best portrayal of the 1st Air Cav's action at Ia Drang (the only battle of the Vietnam War in which sizable US Army and NV Army forces faced each other).

You'll like this movie if:
You liked ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", or Mel Gibson in ""The Patriot.""

You're expecting a strict antiwar piece, a reprise of Mel Gibson in ""Gallipoli"" or the complicated subplots and storyline of ""The Deer Hunter"".

In the end, this is a movie of war and the people involved, and it is a very good one.  It's a decent translation of the book to film, and the best portrayal of the 1st Air Cav's action at Ia Drang (the only battle of the Vietnam War in which sizable US Army and NV Army forces faced each other).

You'll like this movie if:
You liked ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", or Mel Gibson in ""The Patriot.""

You'll dislike this movie if:
You're expecting a strict antiwar piece, a reprise of Mel Gibson in ""Gallipoli"" or the complicated subplots and storyline of ""The Deer Hunter"".

Moore and Sam Elliot is superb as a tough seargent.  The scenes of families at home and the arrival of messages telling of the death of loved ones were well used to illustrate the wider impact of war.  In fact, it was the combination of war scenes and more personal scenes which put it over ""Saving Private Ryan"" (if only barely) in my mind.  Parents should be advised that this is not a film for children.  There is a considerable amount of violence and some pretty harsh language as well (I know that the cursing is realistic but I felt it personally detracted from both this and ""Saving Private Ryan"").  Anyway, I would recommend this film though I advise it is graphic.

Based on the non-fiction book by Col. Moore, it intends to portray a realistic picture of this first battle, while honoring the brotherhood between American soldiers, 'a la ""Saving Private Ryan.""

In a deleted scene (bonus features!) between Col. Moore and McNamara (who should be judged for crimes against humanity), the movie director is very explicit about his goal: ""the movie is not about politics but about soldiers as human beings."" Soldiers and human beings, reflect upon that. Mel Gibson asks the sergeant, ""Am I leading my men into a slaughter just like Gen. Custer?...""

For refusing any criticism of the Vietnam War, the movie gains a Rambo-esque look. Americans are depicted as limpid, good-hearted individuals, Christian white males who heroically carry wounded brothers on their shoulders (note: in the two scenes, the wounded ones are a black and an Asian-American man).

Vietnam -- It's Legacy, It's Lessons for Us Today, 25 May 2005

This film touched my heart in the way it showed the valor, the commitment, the utter devotion and supreme dedication of those whose awful task it was to go to Vietnam and suffer and die, or suffer and live (in many cases a fate worse than death), all for nothing.

Well, it wasn't exactly for nothing, was it?. Many made fortunes off that war, and it is the contrast of the dedication of these great patriots, misguided and downright misled though they were, with the behind-the-scenes corruption and greed that used Communism as an excuse to wage a no-win war at the expense of human life that I wish to address.

I must say the movie did a good job in portraying just how awful it was to have to endure all that over there in Vietnam, and it gave me a new respect for those who went through it all.

Frankly, I didn't make it past the first jungle scene or two before I had to switch off. I couldn't bear to watch all that suffering and dying... all in vain. I was looking at this story of the war in Vietnam with hindsight, since I knew how it was going to end, and my heart groaned over that waste of human life that was going to accomplish nothing good.

We were never meant to win.

Vietnam stank of Machiavellianism on an international scale.

Nicolo Machiavelli was a sub-human parasite. He was a master at profiting from wars and disputes between peoples. If there was no conflict going at the moment he would try to instigate one, and then pretend to befriend both sides behind both their backs. By controlling the purse strings he could keep each side from getting too dominant and annihilating the other, thereby destroying that side's ability to pay off the war debt and also keeping the conflict alive as long as possible. Can we see any resemblance to the Vietnam war here? People back here at home smelled a rat and hated the war. Maybe they couldn't put their finger on the problem, but they knew something was deeply wrong. There was some talk about America having lost her resolve to make the world safe for democracy. Why should the world's greatest power not be able to bring a two-bit country like North Vietnam to its knees, they wanted to know, and couldn't articulate why not.

It wasn't about resolve, it was about money, and sacrificing human life to feed the economy and line the pockets of the ones who stood to gain at the expense of our fighting men's very lives.

The problem is that some of those people who opposed the war also hated our own soldiers for participating in the war. It is in the honor of those valiant men that this review is dedicated. They were patriots and should never have been mistreated by their own, no matter how misguided or exploited they were. They didn't question, they just obeyed. They followed orders, as they were taught to do.

I can't speak for the Army of today, but I can tell you about how it was back in the sixties. Independent thought was discouraged. You were taught to follow orders without question. Military life may always be so. It always has been, that's for sure. I remember one of the Dirty Dozen movies where there was a mission given the dozen to kill some general who planned to assassinate Hitler. The sharpshooter had the general in his sights but the problem was that Hitler was there too, and he thought Hitler made a better target. I remember Lee Marvin's character saying several times,""Just the general"".

He knew that the higher ups in America wanted Hitler alive so he could keep on making his strategic blunders and keep on losing the war for his country. But would Marvin's character confide that to his sniper underling? Not on your life. Just obey orders and do not ask questions was his approach to command.

When I took an oath upon joining the Army I remember I had to sign a paper giving up my rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, especially that of free speech. We were ushered into another room after the swearing-in where it was explained to us that we were now property of the U.S. Army. ""GI"" stands for government issue. You became a part of the weapons arsenal, with your own serial number, even. The power and control that is exerted over you is deep and intense. It is hard to imagine what pressure these men who went to Vietnam were subjected to in order to get them to fight this awful war.

All I can say for those poor, blind, and misguided souls who fought in Vietnam is may God bless them, both living and dead. I deeply appreciate their unselfish devotion to their country and to the oath they swore.

But also, may God curse those who exploited them so they could become rich. A curse on them and all that their filthy blood-soaked money ever built.

And a curse on all those who would repeat that abuse today --or in the future.

But let us not forget that we are supposed to be a government of, by, and for the people. In America, the government derives its power to govern from those governed. If we have let our country become a government of the people, by the politicians, for the special interest groups, if we refuse to discharge our obligation to remain ever vigilant over those whom we elect to run our country, then will the blood of those who fought and died (or else survived, broken and traumatized) not be on our heads as well?",1202688000,3,5612,4.473581213307241

1729477,5,B000068TSI,"The reviewer for the New Yorker really exposes his bias.  This event takes place in 1965, not 1968-69.  there is a big difference in that fact.  we had just escalated troop levels there, it was early in the war, morale was high and the Army felt it was vastly superior to the NVA and VC. We had not experienced the attrition associated with the long slog Vietnam would soon become. If you really want to get to the heart of the matter, watch the deleted scenes on the DVD- particularly the last deletion where Moore meets Westmoreland and McNamara in Saigon.  They are both elated, ecstatic about the success of the battle- the casualty numbers are astoundingly favorable to the US, and they smell a quick victory.  Moore nervously tells them they are seeing it wrongly, that the NVA were willing to keep coming at them regardless of the casualty rate...that they wouldn't quit until the last man.  It was quite prophetic.  The director decided to cut the scene because he didn't want to politicize the movie, which was commendable.  The tragedy back at Benning, where an unprepared army delivers casualty notification telegrams by yellow cab, and a horrified Julia Moore decides to deliver the rapidly mounting death notices herself, is as poignant as it gets in a movie.......If you want to experience the flip side of the war, where hopelessness and lack of conviction have taken hold of the soldiers stuck there, well then Platoon and Apocolypse Now tell that tale.",1201564800,,1469,4.801587301587301
1729478,5,B000068TSI,"No matter what anyone says about Mel Gibson's real life, he knows how to make a movie that moves you. And is real. And holds no punches.

Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, Apocalypto, all are REAL life, and he films them true, emotional, and as bloody as the times they portray.

All the details can be found on other reviews...the dates, the names. I only want to review the emotions of this movie, and its quality. Because it is the emotions of Vietnam, that we carry to this day.

When I was 17, I had already had my first two induction `interviews'. I was 2 weeks from being inducted. I had scored 99% on the tests and was told I was going to be a 2nd Lt., which meant an immediate detail to the front line as cannon fodder. My neighbor, Steve Buck, came home from Vietnam after 4 years. He was there as an adviser, and he was a Seal. Steve was involved some of the very first Viet/American confrontations. His stories were of blood and horror, and of futility. He lived across the street from my family, and we heard his nightmare screams in the middle of the night. His nightmares were horrible. As a young man who abhorred war, I tried to ask him what awaited me. The talks were usually accompanied by his bursting into tears for the friends he lost. His answers were about the closeness of his fellow grunts, the BOND between soldiers, that they were closer than family, and the ideal that they lived together or died together, at least in the beginning. Later, it became just the desire to survive.

This film shows the first confrontations. When the idealism of One Unit to live or die existed.;..when commanders were the father to the grunts. It also shows the men as fathers, especially Gibson's scenes with his family before he is sent to fight.

Gibson shows that early war dedication as Lt Hal Moore, in charge of troops surrounded by the enemy (a la `The 300'). He is repeatedly told to abandon his troops, but refuses. Instead of the usual Pretty Boy role, Gibson is hard and gritty, as he was in Braveheart. It is Lt. Moore's dedication to his men that is the whole point of this film.

Greg Kinnear shows his acting skills as the helicopter pilot who refuses to abandon the trapped squad. Anyone who doubts Kinnear can carry a role must see this film. The empathy he shows for the ground troops is almost overwhelming,

The soundtrack is moving. the cinematography is exact, and the brutality is not skirted. The color is artfully washed during the battle scenes to show the darkness of battle and death. But at the same time, the blood is  scarlet to highlight the pain and horror.

If you are into war movies, I advice this film, as well as `Saving Private Ryan', and `Full Metal Jacket'. These films deal with the emotions of war.",1201046400,,2748,4.490981963927855

The sound options are a little better with DTS 6.1es and Dolby 5.1ex on offer compared to the DVD version. Whilst none of the new digital codecs are here,sound overall is good and the battle scenes will not disappoint if heard through a half decent amplifier. Effects are well rendered with a good sense of ""spaciousness"" and steering of sound across channels is nicely executed.

The picture is much better than DVD,and whilst not perhaps the best HD disc ever made it is a noticeable and significant step up from plain standard definition. Colours are rich and strong and the detail on offer is superb. The contrast available is good also with the night scenes being particularly effective.

A simple Google of the name Hal Moore opened an enormous volume of information. Notably, for me at least, was the actual ""after action report"" prepared by Col. Moore himself which provided the blow by blow description of the battle of Ia Drang the focus of the movie. This is an astonishing tale of the type of military leadership that is so often overlooked in our great nation. There is much to be learned from men like Colonel Moore. I enjoyed the movie as a war story but more importantly I also learned the type of preparation a commanding officer like Colonel Moore puts into his assignment. As a civilian I could only assume that any commanding officer worth his salt would study the maps of the terrain he was about to assault. This man took it far deeper and studied the history of his enemy, its role in this location and most importantly the NVA leadership and tactics.

So it was with deep regret that I saw Gibson take HUGE liberties with historical facts that were painted onto history's pages with the blood of those brave men.

There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said about the story itself.  I would just say that the great strength of this film lies in its focus on the soldiers as real people, with real lives, real families, real personalities, etc.  Gibson did an excellent job of emphasizing the emotional and psychological trauma of war, both for those in the battle and those waiting at home for news.

This production was gritty, realistic and hard-hitting, similar to the Private Ryan/Band of Brothers standard for graphic portrayal of war violence.  Actors like Gibson, Kinnear, and Moore gave extemely believable performances, with Harris Pepper's character only marginally less convincing.  Finally, I enjoyed the absence of political commentary or moralizing about the war overall.  The only criticism that came across was directed toward the military leaders who put the 7th Cav. in that position in the first place.  Beyond that, Gibson just told it like it was.

Being the most accurate and realistic Vietnam movie Hollywood has ever produced, it has turned into a invaluable tool for Husbands, Sons and Fathers to be able to truly show their families just how horrific being in a combat situation was for them.  It can really open the eyes of some people that couldn't understand why Vets are still strugling to deal with the after-effects the war had on them mentally.  This is just my experience as a 34 year old father and husband and how it effected me watching this movie with my father.

I was not in the Vietnam war, but my father flew the Huey right through the thick of the battles, exactly as it shows in the movie.  He has also been a Bell Helicopter employee all his life.

I watched this movie with him when it came out on DVD, I saw it in the theatre and finally convinced him to come over and watch it with me when it came out on DVD.  See, my dad is not a big movie fan, he has a ranch here in Texas and isn't much impressed with all the Hollywood flair and glorification they used in the other movies.  I could tell this was different when about 1/3 of the way through I looked over and he was intently watching the movie and had not said one word.  When it was over, he simply said ""Wow, I never thought a movie would hit so close to home, that was pretty darn close to real"".

That's when a movie became more than ""just"" a movie.  We watched it again, but this time he told me stories I have never heard about his tour, details of how Mom and him lived on base like that, things I never knew but am very thankful that the movie brought back memories he had forgotten and I heard a part of his life I had only speculated about.

It was great listening to him point out parts of the movie and explaining how accurate a certain part was and how that's just how it was like on another part. There were some really incredible events that he lived through over there, I mean amazing stories I would have never known about.  I never even knew he had been that involved in the action, he never really would go into detail, but this movie have him a picture to use to help me visualize the fear and horror that he and the other front line soldiers had to endure.

This movie still had some Hollywood flair to it, but when a movie can create that kind of impact on someone, and create an unforgetable evening spent with my father learning about his past, it is worth 5 + stars to me. We watched it 3 times since then, and those moments spent with my father are forever going to be remembered by myself.

Colonel Moore comes off looking pretty good.  Maybe he was, maybe that's why he made Lieutenant General.

All I can say is Hollywood sure loves napalm (it isn't anywhere near as effective as shown in the movie; the Air Force must have paid to have the movie made.  All I can say is that I never had a Phantom stay on station longer than ten minutes and you had to cease firing all artillery and mortars before they'd come in.  All for one or two 500 pound bombs.  Just not worth it.

Artillery on the other hand could crank out 60 105mm rounds per minute sustained fire with a battery of six howitzers. . That's with just with the direct support 105mm howitzers in direct support of the infantry battalion, not counting any 155mm or eight inchers.

This movie is primarily about the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.  As far as I could tell it was fairly realistic, except that:

I never saw the first tracer round fired and no one showed an illumination fire mission.  Useful when you're fighting at night.  They did show the infantry firing their 81mm mortars and their four deuces.  I used these primarily for illumination fire mission, of course I was in Viet Nam somewhat later, in 1969 and 1970, and had some twenty batteries of artillery that could shoot for me.

As an artillery officer I'm appalled at how poorly they used their artillery fire support.  I would have relieved my forward observer if that had been mine.  Maybe artillery needs to hire a better PR firm.

All-in-all an entertaining movie.

The movie is rated R for a reason.  A lot of blood and guts.

1729510,4,B000068TSI,"I watched this film after a friend who was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam recommended it as the best film on that war. Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, the film tells the true story of the first major encounter between American troops and North Vietnam. There, in the la Drang Valley (""the Valley of Death""), 450 Americans were dropped by helicopters into a clearing and subsequently ambushed and surrounded by 2,000 Viet Cong from October 23 to November 6, 1965. In addition to capturing the bravery, patriotism, heroism, horror, and idiocy of war, this film is special for at least two reasons. First, it portrays the battles that the families who were left at home also had to fight while their loved ones were 12,000 miles away. The entire first third of the film focuses on the families at home, and the rest of the film repeatedly cuts back to them. Second, the film humanizes the enemy. The enemy must be fought, but they are not ""evil."" In fact, we learn that they are just like us. There are five prayers in this film, one of which is by a Viet Cong and which, verbatim, could have been uttered by any human being. Similarly, right after watching a young American widow grieve, the film cuts to a young Vietnamese widow crying as she clutches a diary returned from her dead husband (the diary contains her own picture that her husband had carried). The end of this film names the Americans who died at la Drang; it also pays tribute to ""the members of the People's Army of North Vietnam who died in that place."" There are no winners or losers in this film, or any political statements, for in the last few minutes we learn that these soldiers ""fought not for country or for flag but for each other.""

Unlike previous films, you will NOT see GIs shooting civilians for sport, raping Vietnamese girls, cussing like sailors, fooling around with prostitutes or just getting drunk.  What you WILL see are well-trained Americans fighting insurmountable odds while looking out for their brothers in arms.  Compared to more pessimistic movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""We Were Soldiers"" may come across as right-wing patriotic propaganda.  However, this movie's ultimate aim is to show what actually occurred at the combat field from a soldier's viewpoint rather than to preach to the public a pacifist political message about the Vietnam War or war in general.  One of my few complaints are 1) that the level of North Vietnamese casualties appeared exaggerated while that of the Americans appeared minimized, despite the 4 to 1 casuality ratio that actually occurred during that November 1965 battle, and 2) the climatic, but fictional, bayonet charge at the end that reminded me too much of a real bad patriotic war film also starring Mel Gibson.",1160438400,3,1487,5.149377593360996

 In Vietnam, the battle that would become known as Hamburger Hill resulted in over ninety per cent of one American platoon dead.  Yet a body count would still have been necessary to see which side suffered the greater losses.  Directing mass charges via waves of infantry in modern warfare was initially chronicled during the Korean conflict only later officially recognized as a 'War'.  And importantly, Hamburger Hill was also a battle before it was made into a movie also about a war named but never declared.

As an overview, to modern war, film-making or Army life, ""We Were Soldiers"" merits full consideration.

Mel Gibson turns in a flawless performance walking point on this sortie that became the first major battle of the Vietnam conflict, later unofficially entitled a ""War.""

One loses count of the important issues exposed in this courageous work.  Many would ask, ""So who cares?""  And that would garner the first score for Gibson.

Author Hal Moore, whose ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"" is the basis for this film, certainly deserves first bow for initiating this work, though he might return a horse laugh at the use of 'bow.'

Employment of the term 'Broken Arrow,' classically displays military communication at it's best. WWII vets lived the situation minus the handy appellation.  Thus came, 'Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.'  That uttered by a man of God in the heat of battle.

1729521,2,B000068TSI,"Overview

Based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young,"" the movie is set in 1965 where Lt. Col Hal Moore (played by the handsome Mel Gibson) is Commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry during the Vietnam War. Coincidently, this was the same regiment that was led by George Armstrong Custer (of Little Big Horn fame), however, although mentioned in passing over the course of two plus hours, the writers and director failed to make the relevance of such a fact comprehensible. In fact, it's a wonder, through the mesh of body parts, explosions, shooting, and muddled dialog, that any semblance of a plot could be grasped out of this film. Can you guess where this review is headed?

What I Didn't Like

Right out of the gate, I have to say this movie was trying so hard to be the Tom Hank's heart-wrenching and often visually disturbing drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) and, good lord, it really, really wasn't. We Were Soldiers did do a decent job of displaying the brutality and viciousness of war, but it so vastly lacked the comprehension and flow of dramatic storytelling that they might as well have called the film ""We Were Some Guys."" Starting from the opening credits and ending with the closing image I got the sense that the only director's instruction was ""I want lots of running around, confusion, getting dirty, and plenty of violence."" No story, no content, nothing. Literally, it felt like a complete sequence of: Blood. Unintelligible dialog. Blood and body parts. More Unintelligible dialog. More blood and body parts with screaming.

The more I think about it, the more I realize how much I disliked We Were Soldiers.

Between the constant switch from the U.S. to the North Vietnamese sides of the conflict, half the time I didn't know what was going on, where the hell they were and who the hell was and wasn't dead at any given time. In fact, the character development for the men on the battlefield, other than that for Gibson, was so poor I was completely un-invested in the fate of those in moments of heroics or tragedy. Instead of reacting to the pursuing drama, my thoughts were quickly subdued with questions like ""What was the name of that guy who was just killed and is he the same guy that was with that other guy that was trapped on that hill, wherever that was?""

On the home front, Madeleine Stowe (Last Of The Mohicans) and Keri Russell (that chick from Felicity) play the wives of the Mel and Chris Klein (American Pie) characters, stuck on the base waiting for either the dreaded telegram or for their men to return. After a get-to-know-you get-together with the other ladies on the base, they find themselves delivering ""I regret to inform you..."" letters door to door like Grim Reaper Avon Ladies. Even these potentially heart-tugging events were ruined by the drone-like acting from Stowe, who's overly-abundant, collagen-injected lips achieved some Olympic-sized scene stealing, while Russell wasn`t much better, but at the very least showed some trace amount of emotion when the situation warranted.

What I Did Like

No really, there were actually a few aspects of the film that I did like... and I did say a few. The only likable characters in this film were those played by Gibson, Kinnear, and Pepper, but for probably all the wrong reasons. As almost a matter of principal, I tend to be drawn to anyone Gibson plays, and not simply for wooed-female reasons. As one of my favorite actors, Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) was also a favorite here, although his character, while heroic, was rather nondescript. As for Barry Pepper, who portrayed UPI reporter Joe Galloway, his performances in The Green Mile and that other, less generic war movie with Tom Hanks I mentioned earlier, managed to carry him to a passing grade in this one as well. In addition to the familiar characters and stars, I also appreciated the attempt, however weak and unnecessary, to show the conflict from the North Vietnamese point of view. Presenting our enemy as a husband, father, boyfriend, or brother, rather than merely an evil, gun-toting thug was a welcome break from the norm.

Bottom Line

It has all the star power and a foundation based on an intriguing piece of history to boot, but in the end this was, for all intents and purposes, a brutal as all hell war flick, with some equally brutal acting (sans Gibson), directing, and overall script.

Not since the dreadfully pleasant Brit-inspired Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) have I wanted to returned to the video store and demand a refund.

1729522,5,B000068TSI,"Every now and again, movies depicting factual events (Saving Private Ryan, JFK, We Were Soldiers, Windtalkers, et al) are either vilified or praised.  Depending on how well you value historical accuracy VS creative liberties, the movie you are watching could be the best or the worst.

Pvt Ryan didn't exist; according to some of the Navajo Windtalkers-the movie of the same name had a few ""Hollywood Moments"".  Point is, there's probably no movie out there without a few liberties taken here and there in the script.  Email me one or two (with verifiable examples) and then you will have a definite discussion on your hands.

Either way, WWS made my then-fiance cry after the final battle scene, once Moore (Gibson) placed his foot on the copter and gave the field a final once over.  This is a fantastic movie that shows (finally), how the North Vietnamese tactics were utilized to try to cut off supply lines, and so on.  From what I read from the book; which I read before even production wrapped up on the movie (I finished the book about two weeks before the first trailers were released in the theatres), Moore and Plumbley were accurately protrayed as gritty career soldiers that wanted to win.  The ""stand up while everyone else is down"" is the way one is supposed to be when directing troops on the field.  This way, the Colonel (or Sgt Major) can get an overview of the situation.

Moore is a booksmarts Colonel.  You can gather that from the constant studying of Custer's Last Stand, the Battle of French Indochina massacre, and the capabilites of the Huey.  He also brings up a story about a Native American brought up by the whole village.  The meaning behind it is clear.

From an interview from Randall Wallace roughly two months after the movie was released: ""....Harold Moore is portrayed in the script as a larger-than-life leader who seemed to always make the right move. In a newspaper interview the real Harold Moore was quoted as saying that he would have liked John Wayne to play him, indeed. But what supports this presentation in the script is the book. I know, he wrote the book, and could present himself any damn way he wanted. But when you read the book, you get the sense of a humble, honest, and heroic solider who was not going to let his men down, he would rather face death then face the widow of a solider who he did not return home from the battlefield, dead or alive. He wasn't trying to be a hero, but just doing his job....""

Not only does WWS show the first major skirmish of the Vietnam Conflict, but it also shows the overall effects of the wives.  The letters, the angst over a falsified address, etc.  It tugs at the heart when you see the one black woman almost refusing to accept the telegram.  You don't get that in most other war movies; nor do you see the wives interact with each other.  A friend of mine compared the living room scene early in the movie to a meeting of wives and girlfriends at a Reserve Center Base or Training Grounds.

The only ""Hollywood"" moment I really saw was the Joe Galloway montage during Day 3.

Sgt Savage had the hardest job in the world.  He had no formal training, nor did he even want the job of troop leader when both his Lt's died.  But he did a remarkable job in helping his fellow soldiers through an extremely trying day and a half at the Knoll.

This is a ""Flag Waver""...but in sticking to the American style of moviemaking...one must keep with a happy and warm ending.

Watch Darkman or Basic Instinct for examples of endings that don't quite gel with most people.

Rent it...or better yet, buy it...and crank the speakers to 11.",1138924800,6,3621,4.540832049306625

1729524,5,B000068TSI,"I was soooo glad to see how well amazon viewers reviewed We Were Soldiers.  Many critics slammed the movie when it came out for being too flag-waving and unrealistic, as well as chastising Mel Gibson for being over-the-top in his role as Hal Moore.  What they failed to understand was that the battle actually happened, and Col Hal Moore served as a technical supervisor for the film.  In the special features he specifically states that their only concern was to ""get it right"".  As for being ""flag-waving"", I have yet to discern how that is a criticism of an American war movie.  We are shocked and horrified by the events depicted on screen, and the fact that they actually happened makes them even more awful, but this movie shows us the spirit of the ""American fighting man"" at its best.  Lastly, I cannot fault Mel Gibson for attempting to capture the full range of emotion of one of the finest battlefield commanders in American history.  I personally think he does a terrific job, as nobody does ""epic"" quite as well as Mel.

  Numerous Vietnam veterans have reviewed this film to testify to its realism and accuracy.  To me, that's all that needs to be said.  I bought We Were Soldiers earlier this year, have watched it probably 20 times, show it to every one of my friends who hasn't seen it yet, and it hits me harder each time.  When the battle is over and we are finally allowed to reflect on what happened, it is almost impossible not to tear up.  So kudos to Randall Wallace for having the guts to make this film and for being unabashed in his patriotism, and a heartfelt thank you to all Vietnam veterans for your courageous service.",1137369600,3,1650,4.549152542372881
1729525,5,B000068TSI,"Saving Private Ryan spawned the whole bring back of war movies in general. Though many never lived up to Saving Private Ryan,this is no exception. This never was in that category this is a much grittier war film. Depicted with much more realism than many have the guts to do so.

During the Vietnam conflict we lost many soldiers and gained many hero's.(I shouyld know as my uncle got a grenade fragment lodged into his eye)As many said this is dead on to the harsh and cruel reality of society and war as a whole. Raising your head or adjusting an uncomfortable strap could be the difference between life or death.

The movie starts off alittle slow after a short but intense intro. Once kicked into war full throttle it stays that way the whole film. With miner cut ins of the soldiers wives.(Little but realsitic side plot)

Many who fought in the wars look at war films and critique them on the actions and looks given off,because they know what it was really like and the true horror of wondering if survival is questionable or false hope or if anyone in modern day can actually understand the true concept of what these brave men went through. Movies most oftenly never catch that. We Were Soldiers not only shows you the teamwork and epic struggle but the terrifying images of what the soldiers faced to get to that strong bond with oneanother. The movie flickers from one soldiers point of view to another soldiers and then you wonder whats with the random chaos?Squad to squad dead soldier to dead soldier eventually you see all these loosends tie in. When a main character or a well known character dies for his country you always feel that pain and shallowness. One thing i was truly amazed by was the fact that they show you that our (U.S. troops)isn't always ruthless. They show you what some of Vietnamiese had to part with to fight for honor. The soldiers going into battle are young and inexperienced and don't know what to expect,you can see their mistakes and what they learned from them.

Movies like this really help those who are greedy or inconsiderate to others,as it teaches you what these soldiers went through and what you take for granted. They are no stronger or smarter then any of us they were working as a family to progress(Wich all of should and can).A really heartwarming and terrifying film all in one creepy way.

1729526,5,B000068TSI,"Unlike other so-called ""war"" movies about Vietnam, this is actually a straight-up war movie.  Movies like ""Apocolypse Now,"" ""Hamburger Hill,"" etc were more DRAMA than war.  But for those people who like movies such as ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Bridge Too Far,"" etc, this is the movie to see.  It's a war movie through and through.  My second favorite movie about Vietnam was the one which starred Alec Baldwin as McNamara - although that was more political, it was still a no-nonsense film about Vietnam.

Now I want to address the online reviewer who said that anyone who makes war is ""not a good Christian.""  Obviously, that person had never read the Bible because in the Old Testament, they fought all the time.  And even St. Thomas Aquinas (a Christian SAINT) justified the ""just war.""  The Vietnam War was fought to keep the North from conquering the South - if that's not just, I don't know what is.

The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the little sideshow where Barry Pepper was taking pictures of the battle.  Sure, war is horrible, but it's necessary.  War is the only thing on this planet that drove the fascists out of Europe.  War is the only thing that stopped Saddam Hussein from annihilating the Kuwaitis.  And war is the way we won our freedom.

If you want peace, move to a country like Sweden.  They were so pacifist, they allowed the Nazis to drive right through their country and destroy Norway.  Way to go, pacifists.",1136246400,4,1446,4.633858267716535
1729527,5,B000068TSI,"From the casting to the dialogue to the weapons, uniforms and equipment, We Were Soldiers should be on every list of the all-time best war movies. I'm an Army veteran (didn't serve in Vietnam but did see the Gulf War) and I appreciated the realism of the combat scenes, the training and preparation, the leaders' devotion to their troops and the depiction of the tactical decisions by the commanders on both sides.  I thought this was superior to every recent war movie, including Saving Private Ryan, with the exception of Black Hawk Down - and it's the equal of that one.

Among the things I particularly liked was the fact that the home front was shown but not excessively; the bond between the Air Cav Huey pilots and the grunts; the recognition that the timely application of air support saved the battalion from being overrun; the ""other side"" is shown in a realistic manner, without condescension or caricature, but mainly without ""PC"" revisionism either (the best war movies, like Battle of Britain and Tora Tora Tora, are usually the ones that do this); and the extremely realistic depiction of close-quarter combat, wounds, cameraderie and bravery under fire. This movie has the most excruciatingly realistic simulation of a burn casualty I've ever seen and really brings home the sacrifices made by our troops.

The acting and performances are great. Mel Gibson is outstanding as LTC Moore, even to the accent, and looks and acts like a cavalry squadron CO in his every mannerism, expression and speech. I can't praise enough Sam Elliott's portrayal of the hard-as-nails Command Sgt. Major fighting his last war - perfect in every way, and he has some of the best dialogue in the movie (""Can't take any pictures down there, Sonny"" and ""Time comes I need a rifle, there'll be plenty lying around, Sir"").

Also getting high marks for realism from me are the air strikes (especially the effects of the 20mm from the Skyraiders), the reaction of the Air Cav pilot when berated for leading Medevacs into a hot LZ, the feeling evoked by the troops all gathering at the buses that will take them, ultimately, to combat, the scenes of Gibson praying with his children and his lieutenant, the realistic calls for artillery and air support, etc - I could go on forever. One of the best scenes is when the Hueys are returning for another ammo/wounded run while the air strikes are going on and two fighters can be seen through the helo cockpit, pulling up from their bombing runs.

Of course, this being produced by Hollywood, it's inevitable to have at least a few hokey scenes, even with Hal Moore himself as a technical advisor. The home front scenes of delivering the casualty notices seem contrived (I agree with the 'Nam vet who said the notices probably wouldn't have arrived during the battle) - it's hard to believe that the Army gave the families no support whatsoever, not even sending a chaplain or officer to notify the next of kin who are living on a military base, but that may be the way it is in Moore's book (I haven't read it yet). Gibson's/Moore's return home also is unlikely - that he'd just sort of walk in the door unannounced, more likely the unit would have come back and everyone would know when their husbands were returning. Also agree with an earlier review that the final scene with the NVA colonel almost tenderly handling a tiny American flag is pretty improbable and smacks of the only real case of ""PC"" in the movie. The final American scene, with the horde of reporters emerging from a CH-47 to cluster around Joe also is unlikely - even if the artillery round that goes off is ""friendly,"" if it lands that close and there's still a need for artillery fire, it's unlikely that the Army would have choppered a crew of reporters into the area. It would have been more realistic if different helicopter crews, not just Snake and Too Tall, were shown, giving the impression that these two pilots were the only ones in the 7th Cav's aviation squadron who continued to make runs into the area. The last part of the final charge is also pretty hokey - doubtful that the helicopters would have timed their appearance just at the moment when the US troops appeared lined up at the crest of the high ground (a very bad tactical move by a commander who was shown to have exercised very good tactical judgement up to then), or that they would have hovered just off the ground to fire when the enemy had heavy machine guns in the area.

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud

Of vile incurable sores on innocent tougnes...""

  -Wilfred Owen, from his 1917 poem ""Dulce et Decorum est""

I know this is a movie review, but the movie is based on a terrible mistake in history that we still have not learned from, and the historical lesson is more important than the showbusiness.

WE WERE SOLDIERS is a much-needed wake-up-call.  It is a blood-splattering nightmarish accurate depiction of what happens when the United States government goes deaf, blind, and mentally insane all at the same time (i.e. seeing the apparitions of groundless fears).  Aside from the 58,000 American boys just like me who were slaughtered to shreads of dead hamburger meat and the 300,000 who were wounded physically and corrupted mentally, betrayed by the murderous country they fought for, the American military killed three million north Vietnamese who had no imperialistic intentions but instead simply wanted their own country once and for all, free from French occupation.  Ho Chi Minh was not a bad guy at all; he wanted a peaceful, unified, INDEPENDENT Vietnam free from foreign influence and had before the war been willing to embrace any system of government-- anything, even DEMOCRACY-- to accomplish this.  The US did not JUMP on this diplomatic opportunity because they had forgotten or ignored the fact that HO CHI MINH HAD PRAISED THE UNITED STATES' 1776 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND EVEN EMULATED PARTS OF IT IN HIS OWN 1954 VIETNAMESE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE!!  We had the chance to negotiate, to have given him a full copy of our document so that he could have seen what he could do with it further, and war would have been avoided-- sooo easily!  So Ho Chi Minh signed on with the communist party because they were the only ones willing to be tough with the French and to strive for a unified, independent, non-imperialistic Vietnam.  As for the US: Folly? yes. Debacle? certainly. MISUNDERSTANDING? Yes, most of all!.

The Vietnamese today, rightly so, call this war ""THE AMERICAN WAR"" which is of course a better name for the war because the Americans were the evil agressors in a foreign land of innocent defenders.

A movie, based on reality, well done.  Highly recommended.  Every American should have to go through the pain of watching it, along with the other esteemed movies about the Vietnam, I mean, American War.

1729531,5,B000068TSI,"I was three yrs old when the Vietnam War ended for America (1973).  But like everyone in my generation I grew up in its shadow.  A shadow very unlike WW2, which cast an aura of invincibility, unity, triumph and glory.  Instead, my generation came up in the Vietnam War's vicious, hateful, divisive politics that still dominate the national discourse today.

So to me, and the millions of others in their 30's and 40's, Vietnam is both past and present.  To understand today's political climate and ideological animus which drives it, Vietnam must be understood.  But before that, the experience of the men who fought and died 12,000 miles away in places most had never heard of, must be grasped.  And, as other reviewers here have noted, most ""Vietnam"" movies tend to concentrate on politics, propaganda or the just plain weird (to this day I'm still not sure what, despite its cinematic phantasmagoria, exactly Francis Ford Coppola was trying to say with ""Apocalypse Now"").

""We Were Soldiers"" eschews all three.  The prism through which Randall Wallace presents his film is the experience of Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (Ret.), Joe Galloway's and the officers and men of the 7th Air Cavalry.  Geopolitics and the macroview are irrelevant here.  As Hal Moore puts it, this is the story of survival, and brotherhood, under the most horrendous things man can do to man.

As Barry Pepper's Joe Galloway, reporter UPI and co-author of the book upon which the movie is based, tells us, in a voice over at the end of the movie, ""[The veterans of Vietnam] went to war because their government ordered them to... But[in the end] they fought for each other.""  And that, more than anything else, is what this movie captures more poignantly and realistically than any other ""Vietnam"" ever has or is ever likely to.

The camraderie of the battlefield is something only those who have survived it can truly understand.  Randal Wallace, the masterful, intensely human Mel Gibson (the irrational, ridiculously petty hatred of him that is expressed by some reviewers mars what are otherwise some good reviews) and the superb cast bring the brutal reality, fear, the blood, death, tragedy, dirt, and the sheer horror as close to the reality as a movie is ever likely to.  Just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" stripped World War II of the rose colored prism of Audie Murphy heroics (one is tempted to say ""melodramatics"") to reveal what was ultimately an ugly, horrible conflict, ""We Were Soldiers"" does something like the opposite.  The Vietnam soldier is FINALLY presented as neither war criminal (""Babykillers!"") or only as a pawn of myopic, idiot politicians, obsessed with the quotidian (though he certainly was that) ""kill-ratios.""

Everytime I watch this movie I find myself feeling deeply moved, the emotions nearly as strong as when I saw the Wall in DC in high school.  As I watched it with my father, who was too old for Vietnam, we both found ourselves in tears.  With stark simplicity this film brings the reality home of what it the was ultimately was about: the men who fought and died in it.  The men who were seared together in a bond of brotherhood that transcended the political, racial and religious divisions that were (and still are) rending our national fabric.  To the soldiers, as Galloway's narration tells us, what they became together was more important than anything else.

If ""We Were Soldiers"" leaves you with nothing else, it should be the penultimate image of the airport, where one 7th Cav vet pushes another, wheelchair bound, through the airport--with no marching bands, no crowds of of eager families, no TV news cameras to ""hail the conquering heroes.""  The Vietnam veteran came home very much as he'd left it: quiet and unnoticed.  Though occasionally denounced & insulted, he was far often simply forgotten; he was an unwanted & visible reminder of the tremendous upheaval our society had endured.  The country wanted to forgot that and the easiest way was to forget him.

""We who have seen war will never stop seeing war,"" Galloway tell us, and no movie can be anything but a pale echo of that reality.  But what a deeply moving pathos Wallace and Gibson bring to it!

There is an intangible quality this movie captures what few war movies, and no Vietnam movie, have ever brought tbeen able to do.  If Hal Moore himself, in one of the documentaries on the DVD, can say, ""[This is] the first movie that gets it right,"" what more needs to be said?

Watch the movie with awe and gratitude for it gives to the men who fought in the Ia Drang in 14-16 NOV, 1965, what Lincoln did for the men who had fought 102 years earlier at Gettysburg:  a monument so that we can ""never forget what they [gave]...the last full measure of devotion.""

Wallace and Gibson give us a tribute to those brave young men (four of whom won the Congressional Medal of Honor during the battle) that ""neither adds nor detracts"" but presents it as closely as any work of art ever can.

I can never know what it was like to fight and die in that place.  I can never know, equally, what it was like to wait, anxious and benumbed, as the wives and families of the men of the 7th Air Cav.  To repeat, nothing can ever give these experiences of those men and women to those who didn't live through, but this movie finally allows me to understand, on some small level, what is was like to be ""soldiers [then] and young.""",1133308800,7,5390,4.715048025613661

1729543,5,B000068TSI,"This is a difficult review to write.  There is power and insight in this movie that goes deeper than any given moment in any given war.  I will leave the discussion of the details to those that lived through them (Thank you for your service and your sacrifice!).

What is impressive about this movie is the statement it clearly makes about war and the human capital that is expended in war.  It is not so much an ""anti-war"" movie, as at least one reviewer mentioned, it is rather an honest examination of the respect and value (or lack of it) that we have for the positive qualities of a warrior in our culture.  Not the gung-ho, testosterone-poisoned caricacture of bloodshed for its own sake, but the essential quality of sucking it up when asked (or required by circumstances) to make a personal sacrifice to further the greater good--of service to one's family, comrades, country or ideals in both peaceful and horrific contexts. As such, ""We Were Soldiers"" can most accurately be described as an ""anti-waste"" movie.  What the movie ultimately portrays is the essential quality of true warriors (both male and female--how many men do you know that would have the courage to deliver those telegrams to people you know?) and what a precious resource that quality is--whether in peacetime doing good in the community or during war when it is expended in battle.  This movie squarely asks the question of whether we as a nation are willing to sacrifice our warriors (in whatever capacity) for less than the most important of reasons?  Given recent history, it appears that we are.  And that is the tragedy that is depicted here and what tears at you when you leave.

No need to wait until the end of this movie to start crying as suggested by another reviewer.  I was in tears after the first ten minutes.....

See this movie.  The odds are you will walk away with more insight than you came in with.  Even more perhaps, than you wanted or can continue to remain comfortable with.",1119484800,9,1980,4.684971098265896

This movie shows the difficulties of a war for the soldeirs when you are merely in a hand to hand fight. After this movie, I am sure that you will not wish to go to war in a place like that.

1729545,5,B000068TSI,"This is a great movie. It is hard to explain why, because it brings up feelings that are hard to explain. I can say that it probably depicts the battle very truthfully. I have the book too, and this movie differs very little from the book. There are a few things that are put in that actually happened later. For example, this movie has the North Vietnamese realising that to overrun the Americans, they have to get in close enough to avoid artilery. It did not happen until a battle shortly after Ia Drang. Also, the North Vietnamese never broke through the American lines in Ia Drang. That was later also. Other than that, nearly all of the details of the battle are correct, except that they did not lose a helicopter while bringing men into the landing zone.

This movie is very bloody, but it almost has to be to accurately depict the action. The movie would not have seemed quite as real without it.

Overall, it is a very good movie. I would highly recommend that you see this movie. Even more, I would recommend that you read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"", which is the book from which this movie was made. It tells about not just the battle, but before and after, telling about what happened to some of the men after they returned from battle. Read or watch and enjoy.",1118361600,3,1293,4.428571428571429
1729546,5,B000068TSI,"I've read the other reviews saying, ""This movie is boring"", ""Too sentimental"", ""Not real"" blah, blah, blah... This movie is true. I reenact Vietnam and have talked to many vets, among them 1st Cav vets (I have met Joe Galloway- the reporter in the movie also) and this movie (along with Hamburger Hill) is always said to be realistic and true. Its unlike Platoon and Full Metal Jacket (thankfully) in that its not all Hollywood bull, but rather portrays the troopers as they really were, and shows the battle how it really was. The lack of self expression is not there because in the real battle it wasn't there (and movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket over do it anyway), and yes, Hal Moore really was that good, whether people like it or not.

I've read the actual book and the movie fits the main story of the battle in nicely, its not all exactly how it was (the third day is a lot of Hollywood for example), but the movie does an amazing job of portraying the battle overall. The absolute confusion and terror of the fight comes out of the screen and draws you in, leaving you gripping your seat.

If you want a great 'Nam flick get this and ""Hamburger Hill"" and you'll be good to go. And please avoid Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, because as a historian of the time I have come VERY close to throwing something at the TV because of the pure stupidity of those two movies.",1117756800,4,1384,4.40234375

The actors are among the best in Hollywood and do a magnificent job. The music by Nick Glennie-Smith is  beautiful, and the words written by Randall Wallace for the end song, The Mansions Of The Lord, are truly a moving tribute to fallen soldiers.

From the cheesy last words of dying soldiers to the ridiculous portrayals of leaders standing fully upright on the battlefield and bravely gunning down enemies while everyone else is clinging to the ground, this movie makes almost no attempt to be a realistic portrayal of war. Heck, the producers didn't even bother filming it in realistic scenery. I had high hopes for this movie, but even before seeing it I started hearing rumblings from Vietnam vets who saw it and were tremendously disappointed.

1729553,4,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is a compelling war movie seen from multiple perspectives.  It is a refreshingly uncommon war movie. The movie disapproves of war.  However, acknowledging that war does exist, this movie celebrates the heroism that can be found in it.

We Were Soldiers not only gives us a look at the soldiers whose side we're on, but the enemy soldiers as well.  It shows that these are people too; they have girlfriends, wives, sons and daughters, just as `our guys' do. The movie also shows us very accurately how war can affect these people who have relationships with the soldiers.

We Were Soldiers takes place in 1965; America has just entered the Vietnam War.  The movie is centered on the 7th Air Cavalry unit.  This new form of cavalry rides into battle not on horses, but in helicopters.  The movie focuses on the soldiers, their relationships with one another and their relationships with their families.

The combination of realistic characters, a dramatic script and a heart-rending story may make viewers' emotions run high.  The movie was much more than gunfights and special effects.  Relationships were explored, and emotion was evident in each character, not always being expressed, but you could see it lying just under the surface.  It would be difficult to see the film in its entirety without tearing up.

Inspiring acts of heroism are celebrated throughout the movie. Selfless acts of bravery were apparent throughout the film.  People had to make sacrifices, and they were rarely for their own benefit.  These acts were also ironic in that many men died for the dead.

A huge slice at the beginning of the movie is used to get the audience familiar to the soldiers in the 7th Air Cavalry.  You get to know their families and their daily lives.  This is especially the case with young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) whose wife is due with a baby.  Klein played a much more sophisticated character in Geoghegan than he is used to (2001's American Pie 2, 2002's Rollerball).  Despite this, I think he did a commendable job.

Getting familiar with the soldiers only serves to make the deaths of the soldiers hit us harder.  The deaths of the soldiers hurt us more when we find out news of their death is sent from Vietnam via telegrams.  It falls to Moore's wife to deliver these telegrams to the various families of the deceased, and we see these epitaphs in all their misery. These poignant scenes show us the full extent of the tragedy of death. They also force the viewers to ask some questions about war that one doesn't always keep in mind.  Is it really worth it? In war you need to know that the forces that made the war occur tried to do everything they could to prevent it from happening. War needs to be a last resort. This is clear from the outright pain and grief it causes other human beings.

The beginning also creates a sense of foreboding.  The first scene of the movie is of a French troupe of soldiers being massacred in the la Drang Valley.  This is the same valley in which the battle between Moore's troops and the Vietnamese was fought. Also, the name of Moore's troops, the 7th cavalry, is identical to that of the fabled General Custer.  Custer was a successful commander like Moore himself until his entire unit was massacred. Foreshadowing perhaps?

Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is an accomplished commander that is appointed as the leader of this unit.  Mel Gibson (1995's Braveheart, 2000's What Women Want) delivers a stunning performance as Moore, the loyal leader who commands the 7th Air Cavalry. Gibson is familiar with the role of a courageous, inspiring leader (Braveheart, The Patriot).  Therefore, playing Moore probably wasn't a challenge for Gibson.  However, I can forgive him because he played the part flawlessly.  The character Gibson plays is both concerned about and dedicated to the troops he leads.  On the eve of the cavalry's departure to Vietnam, Moore proclaims, ""When we go into battle, I will be the first to step on the field and I will be the last to step off.""  Soon, the unit is called into battle and they travel to Vietnam, to a world of war, violence, and destruction.

We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young written by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway. Randall Wallace, who directed it, also wrote the screenplay. Wallace also wrote 1995's Braveheart, 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, and 2001's Pearl Harbor. Wallace and Gibson have paired up before, and in Braveheart, the two were extremely successful together.  Wallace is obviously no newcomer to screenwriting and did a nice job converting the book into a form suitable for film.  He also does a good job directing the film.  He had previously directed 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, so this was not his first movie.  Violent war movies can be a tricky and nauseating experience if the battle scenes aren't filmed with expertise. The war scenes in the film were organized and clear, however they didn't fail to portray the reality of a real life gun battle.  Specifically the scene with the ""hot LZ"" was particularly well done.  Somehow Randall gave us a clear picture of the mayhem that was there along with showing us coherent shots that left us with no questions as to what was occurring.

Although We Were Soldiers might at times be graphic and at others emotionally tough, there is some comic relief.  Sgt. Maj. Plumley (Sam Elliott) is Colonel Moore's strict second-in-command. Elliot is an experienced actor who has been on the scene since the late 60's (1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1998's The Big Lewbowski).  However, I think Plumley posed a fun and fresh character for Elliot, and he played it to perfection.  Elliot's experience was an invaluable asset to the film.  Plumley's demeanor alone was always enough to give me a hearty chuckle. I found myself repeating one of Plumley's lines on multiple occasions, one that involves a fellow soldiers comment on the weather.

We Were Soldiers is rated R, and for good reason.  Many of the gunfights in the la Drang valley and instances with napalm at the end of the movie are hard to stomach.  However, it is my belief that you need to show the world what war really is, how horrific and gruesome it can get. Powdering war up like a geisha is as good as lying to someone.  We Were Soldiers is the real deal; it gives us the impact of war and the reality of it in its entirety. People should see this movie, as it not only entertaining and captivating, but will also develop your understanding of war.  And in this, world, we desperately need this understanding.

1729556,5,B000068TSI,"I consider myself a history buff, especially war history, yet somehow this movie just slipped past me.  So when I did see it I didn't really think it would live up to all the hype I heard, but I was wrong.

This movie is one of the best war movies I've seen.  Based on true events, and strictly so, this movie covers the first major US battle in Vietnam.  It took place in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley.  The action grips us but the story itself lulls us more.

Now I personally am one to feel that the Vietnam War was a bad idea, yet I can see the true austerity that was presented by the film.  This movie shows that Vietnam was no picnic; that's just a given.  This film does not, however, glorify dying. just as much as it doesn't glorify the entire war.  Instead it focuses on the tenacity and strength of a few individuals and their efforts to quell a seemingly, and eventually so, overwhelming army.

On that note, I believe that the film deserves five stars for it's beautiful yet tear-jerking portrayal.  War is hell, and these people lived it.",1102982400,5,1060,4.32994923857868
1729557,4,B000068TSI,"It is sadly clear that many of the negative reviews of this film are based on a lack of understanding of the history of the Vietnam War.  While this film does have its defects, it is correct in most of the particulars of the battle, and furthermore is fairly accurate concerning the qualities of the U.S. soldiers that fought in the Ia Drang valley in 1965.

The Army in 1965 was very different from the Army in 1968 or 1972.  The level of training of the troops was better, and their attitude towards the war was much more optimistic.  This reflected the public attitudes towards the Vietnam War in the United States in 1965, which were overwhelmingly pro-war.  The disillusionment with the war, the vehement anti-war protests, the discrediting of the Johnson administration, and the gradual decay of the Army's morale and combat ability were IN THE FUTURE.  The 1st Cavalry Division was a well-trained and well-disciplined unit, and while it contained plenty of draftees, their attitudes were generally very different than they were later in the war.  Remember that the public supported the war at this time, and their attitudes reflected the public attitudes.  Likewise, the problems with indiscipline, drug use, ticket-punching officers and the soldiers that fragged them, and so forth, DID NOT YET EXIST.

Most Vietnam War movies told the story of the latter parts of the war, when the public had turned against the war in general, and to a large extent against the military itself.  Drafting people into a war that was increasingly unpopular naturally lead to a decline in the fighting ability, discipline and morale of the military itself, with consequences that were sadly predictable.  This, however, was a different time, something that has to be understood as a historical fact when judging this film.

With this in mind, We Were Soldiers was not idealizing the attitudes of the people involved in the battle; it was simply a snapshot in time of a hard-fought battle that started (in the American mind, anyway) a war that was not yet considered unjust, being fought by an Army that was still held in high regard by the public at large... and maybe more importantly, by itself.  In this context, it is clear why many criticisms of this film are rather stupid, to put it mildly.

Thus, We Were Soldiers is quite historically accurate.  The soldiers were largely as they were portrayed in the film, and the battle largely unfolded as described in the movie.  The combat is depicted, rightly, as an awful and gruesome experience.  The behavior of the people involved is rather sentimental, but in truth soldiers who are bleeding to death tend to express simple sentiments, such as, ""tell my wife I love her,"" or ""tell my parents I done good.""  The supremely cynical sort may scoff at this, but they do so in the comfort of a sissified lifestyle, and thus have no basis to judge that sort of thing.  Those who read the book, instead of simply talking out of their behinds, will recognize that some of the most seemingly absurd events are, in fact, true.  That would, however, require INFORMED criticism, instead of simply speaking from simplistic prejudices.

Having said all that, this film is not without its shortcomings.  It focuses excessive attention on the wives back at home, who ARE glorified to a rather silly degree.  Based on my experience in the military, a large proportion of the wives and girlfriends left behind were cheating on the deployed soldiers, or emptying out their bank accounts... a sad fact of life.  More significantly, I found these sequences to be rather boring, and served more as a distraction than as amplification.  The contrast with Black Hawk Down is significant.  In that film, director Ridley Scott did not give the audience a break at all; he simply showed the events largely as they unfolded in as direct and (accurately) brutal manner as possible.  I think it was a better, if less conventional, film for taking that course of action.

As a side note, those calling Black Hawk Down jingoistic must be utterly insane.  It is in many ways the most anti-war movie you will see, simply because it does the best job of showing how awful the actual combat was, and how futile the battle turned out to be for everyone involved.  I think some people won't be satisfied with a movie about the U.S. Army unless it consists entirely of soldiers eating babies alive.

For the grown-ups out there, for the most part this is realistic movie for the period it is supposed to represent, and covers a portion of the Vietnam War largely ignored by Hollywood.  It is not the best war movie made, but is of high quality overall and worth watching.",1101772800,11,4675,4.797752808988764
1729558,5,B000068TSI,"After reading many of the negative reviews complaining that this movie was not a political crusade and did not make the veterans out to be criminals or druggies, I had to write this review.

This film is based on the book, ""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young"" by then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway.  The book is about the first major battle in the Vietnam war in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam.  Colonel Moore, commanded a battalion of troops who were sent to ""find the enemy.""  Little did they know that they were dropped into the middle of a base camp for an entire Vietnamese Army Division. At the end of the battle, Moore's men won the battle despite the fact that they were ridiculously outnumbered.

Through their own memories and extensive research and interviews with those who fought there, Moore and Galloway were able to tell the story of the entire battle as seen through the eyes of soldiers, including the commander of the Vietnamese troops.

This film is true to the book and tells the story of the men who fought bravely and died on LZ X-Ray. The director, Randall Wallace said that he set out to make the movie true to the battle after reading that Colonel Moore said that ""Hollywood had gotten the story of the Vietnam soldier wrong every damned time.""

If you are looking for a pure action movie, this is not for you.  If you are looking for an ideologic, political movie a la Platoon or Apocalypse Now, this is not your movie.

Mel Gibson plays Colonel Moore with much gusto and is very believable as a Lt. Colonel.  Sam Elliott's portrayal of Command Sergeant Major Plumley brought back memories of CSM's and 1st sergeants I knew in my military service. Greg Kinnear as Bruce Crandall, a brave helicopter pilot that kept the wounded moving, the reinforcements and supplies coming.  Barry Pepper rounds out the top four of the cast in a memorable performance as reporter Joe Galloway.  Others  in this movie are Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein of American Pie fame, Keri Russell (Felicity)and Ryan Hurst (Saving Private Ryan, Remember the Titans).

The pace of the movie is very good, beginning with a quick introduction about the Vietnam War.  Showing the troops getting ready to leave their families and the pain their loved ones feel when they do leave.  It then drops us into the middle of battle with cinematography on par with Saving Private Ryan. It is during this time and during the aftermath that we see the incredible bravery and selfless sacrifice on both sides that day. It brought tears to my eyes watching the battle, knowing that this movie was a true account of one of the battles of Vietnam.  The movie also cuts back to the homefront, where the wives eagerly await the return of their husbands and dread the receipt of news that they have become a widow.

Being a veteran of our U.S. Army, maybe I am more sentimental to movies of this nature than non-veterans.  I have seen more war movies than I can remember.  I'll say this...never have I been more moved or more touched or more proud after watching a movie about the brave men of our military.  I am not ashamed to say that I wept during this film.  The portrayal of the battle and the camaraderie of men during battle is dead on and moved me to tears.  The carnage of the war and the dead and dying was hard to watch.  I was very touched that this movie showed the war back home, which has not happened in any film that I can remember.  This movie portrayed the anxiety and fear of the soldiers' wives, who awaited their return and feared every day that they would become widows.

If you want and ideological spin on the Vietnam war made by people who won't stop talking about its failures, rent Platoon or another movie.  If you want to watch a tribute to thos soldiers, and see true heroism and the sacrifice that our soldiers made back then and continue to make today, watch this movie.

Though I currently have a brother serving proudly in the U.S. Army, my own experiences are strictly cinematic.  I wholeheartedly embrace the message this film espouses and any criticisms of it are strictly artistic.  I completely embrace the accounts of Hal Moore and his experiences in Vietnam it's just unfortunate that he did not have a more skilled director like Coppola, Kubrick, or Stone instead of a relative novice film-maker like Randall Wallace.  Better yet, star Mel Gibson should have taken the directorial reigns of this film.  The movie's strength is in it's acting and story.  Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as Moore.  The underrated Sam Elliott gave an awardworthy turn as Moore's gruff aide, Plumley.  Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell are equally good as the women that are left at home.  Greg Kinnear as the cocky chopper pilot is a change of pace for him.  I like the way the film juxtaposes events, going from the battlefield, to the homefront where the wives await the news from the frontlines, to the Americans' Vietcong counterparts who are not faceless entities who have loved ones as well and are just as resolute in the cause that they are fighting for.  This is a story well worth telling, however, it could have been tightened up better.  At times, scenes seem to drag on or it's unclear what exactly is going on in the heat of the battle.

In fact, much of the dialogue is the same way. This film had none of the reality Platoon had, which is the most comprehensive Vietnam War movie.  We Were Soldiers is a very sanitized and fictionalized version of the Vietnam War.

I held it together pretty well until it ended, when the names of the fallen were shown.  Couldn't hold it in after that.  This one really hits you in the gut.

The first time i watched i wasn't so sure some scenes were just too horrific to watch and then i watched it again and the more i watched it the more i liked it and now its easily one of my favourites. Mel Gibson puts on a strong southern accent as Lt colonel Hal Moore CO of the 1/7th. The film is truely brilliant Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper give great performances and you really get connected with them and the rest of the characters its easily the best vietnam movie i ever watched and puts films like Green Berets too shame the ending is very solemn theres no sense of victory in it only of loss. Also unlike some other films it shows the enemy as human which in my view makes a a great war film you feel for the viet cong as much as you feel the US troopers i highly recommend this film but be warned its a very graphic film.,1095465600,2,903,4.022222222222222
1729563,4,B000068TSI,"From the duo that gave us ""Braveheart"", director Randall Wallace and actor Mel Gibson create a realistic and utterly graphic portrayal of the first firefight between American and Vietnames forces in 1965. This is NOT a movie for children or young teens due to its many scenes of the carnage of war.

Based upon the book by two participants of the battle, the movie opens in 1964 with Lt. Col. Harold Moore picking, training and molding his men who were to form the 7th Air Cavalry. It shares with ""Blackhawk Down"" the credo that no man is left behind and the concept that your unit is your family from ""Band of Brothers"".

This is one of the few war films that focuses upon the cost to the wives and families left behind. A nice touch is the parallel bonding done by the wives at home while the men are bonding during their training. Later the movie moves back and forth between the three day battle fought by the husbands and the insensitive telegram notification of their deaths (by Yellow Cab no less) to the wives.

As the emotional heart of the film, Barry Pepper is a standout as the UPI journalist who covers the battle and must bear witness to its cost in American lives (he later co-wrote the book with Lt. Gen. Moore). Mel Gibson (with a Southern accent) gives a fine performance as family man and commanding officer Moore. The supporting cast is excellent (esp. Greg Kinnear as the hotshot helicopter pilot, Sam Elliott as the Sgt. Major and Madelene Stowe as Mrs. Moore among others).

The battle scences are true to their time period (with Moore serving as the technical advisor to the film), the effective soundtrack altenates between Irish melodies & war drumming while the cinematography is rich.

1729564,5,B000068TSI,"Too often Hollywood says they are going to make a movie thats ""real"" and end up making a Special Effects display to rival the 4th of July.

 Not this time. As Col. Moore says in the special features - ""Someone finaly got it Right""

 This movie relies more on the story and the ability of its actors to convey human emotion on all sides, U.S., the wives, even the North Vietnamese, than special effects.

 They do a marvelous job, expecially Gibson and Pepper. Just as in Saving Private Ryan, alot of the emotion is related through the actors' eyes. You see the madness of war and the sheer joy of coming home...just by looking into the eyes.

 Simply Amazing.

 Anyone who knocks this film for its realism has no idea what they are talking about. Remember this, all the things that happened in this movie...happened in 3 DAYS.

Aside from that, look at the finished product:  it's very realistic, touching, devastating and encouraging, too.  Director Randall Wallace spares little in his brutal fight scenes; the horror of war is captured and viewed from both sides.  The film's inclusion of what was going on with the wives is also pertinent; yes, I can believe they'd talk about trivial things such as laundry and shopping; what good would mourning and sitting around discussing things they can't change.  If you watch the actresses closely, you'll sense an underlying nervousness and fear.  The cast is wonderful: Mel Gibson brings his John Wayneish charisma to a role that demands only fierce drive, loyalty and compassion; Madeline Stowe displays her courage and her fear in a role that could have been merely fodder; Sam Elliott's one-toned delivery masks what he feels inside; Chris Klein's turn as the new father destined for disaster is sensitively portrayed; Barry Pepper is remarkable in his role as the journalist on whose book this movie is based; Ryan Hurst as Savage is likewise touching and commendable.  Greg Kinnear is good too as the copter pilot, considering most of his dialogue is delivered on his butt!

Opposite to 1800 Vietnamese, there were almost 360 Americans, supported by artillery, helicopters and extensive use of Napalm bombs by jet fighters. What is heroic on this? Why making a movie about it? Are we back to the 50's to celebrate American heroism of WWII?

Yet unlike other films, it does not demonise the North Vietnamese. It does not make them out to be saints either.
The Vietnamese have intelligent generals and their soldiers are brave. The Americans leadership is  shown as little able to deal with Vietnam and it leads to useless carnage on the battlefield.
The film gives the impression that many hands went into wrting scenes and it jumps uneasily from liberal to conservative viewpoints. Some scenes are simply too heavy handed. At the end of it, I felt it was a good film with some sound ideas, but it just could not make up its mind which way it wanted to jump.
The one overwhelming weak point. Mel Gibson is simply dreadful in his role. Someone should have at least excised the scene of him crying because he could not die with his men. I suspect the actor wanted it in there to show his dramatic range.

1729575,4,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a U-turn for American films about Vietnam.  For years, the best flicks about the war highlighted the nation's disillusionment and cynicism about our involvement in Southeast Asia -- ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" leave the viewer bereft, wondering how to deal with that ball of ice in your stomach.  But each of these films looks back with regret, wtih ""if we only knew the truth at the beginning, we wouldn't have gotten involved over there in that hideous war.""
""We Were Soldiers,"" on the other hand, captures the America at the beginning of the Vietnam conflict.  Most of the soldiers are the earnest, happy-go-lucky young guys we got in the John Wayne war films . . . before they go off to war, they sing and dance with their wives and girlfriends, and they show an innocent heroism under fire.  Only the senior officers, played by Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott, know the truth about war and how savage the Vietnam conflict will be. Mel, as the senior commander, gets a bit jingoistic at times, but that his depiction is apparently dead-on for those who know the real-life commander (who was a consultant on the film).  Sam Elliott, as the grizzled second-in-command, is a wonder -- he stalks the movie with a barely concealed fury, terrifying his own soldiers, but has a moment of exquisite tenderness and leadership with one of his boys.
Like the young soldiers, the audience gets its education on how the conflict will be -- the Vietnamese, who are given a humanity rarely seen in Vietnam movies, still charge with near-suicidal determination.  We see napalm in its hideous applications.  We see the terror of a unit cut off from the main force overnight.  We are stunned by seeing what men can endure and we despair because no man should have to experience the hell of that battlefield.
The movie truly shines with its parallel storyline of the wives and girlfriends back in Georgia who wait for news of their loved ones in combat . . . or, more accurately, pray that they do not receive news.  The movie's most touching scenes revolve around the delivery of the ""We regret to inform you . . . "" telegrams announcing the death of another soldier to their families.  Anyone who can watch these scenes without heartache has not heart.
The DVD also contains some nice extras, including deleted scenes with director's commentary.  It's always interesting to hear why certain scenes didn't make it into a good story, and while some of the deleted scenes were quite good, it's hard to quibble with the explanation.",1083196800,10,2587,4.752232142857143

This film strikes me as the most wildly uneven war film ever made. Scenes of extraordinary power and brilliance alternate with the most hackneyed cliches. At its best, ""We Were Soldiers"" possesses a lyricism not to be found in other war films, especially those about Vietnam. This lyricism comes about through a sort of re-envisioning of moments more or less borrowed from other directors and films (""Platoon"" especially, but also the war films of John Ford and others) within the framework of a band of brothers, the sense of which comes through very strongly despite Gibson's mannered performance as the commander. It comes through most of all in Wallace's use of montage, slow motion, and sound design to create a feeling of mythic eternity, which is counterposed to the gritty realism of the battle. The sequence of the battalion leaving for Vietnam is devastating, as is the montage that depicts the final charge at Ia Drang. (There are one or two montages, however, that don't work so well.)
At its worst, the film telegraphs the tired sentimentalism of the genre: the young lieutenant who the viewer knows in the first five seconds will die in battle, the gruff, homespun commander, the perfunctory cuts to the enemy's command post to make sure the audience doesn't think the film is one-sided, the manipulative use of the home front (with Madeline Stowe in an *appalling* sixties wig).
All the same, I highly recommend this film to lovers of the genre, because its best moments are in fact some of the best of all.",1078012800,4,1684,4.790378006872852

The frustration at the loss of life, the lack of command and control, the lack of support, the distance from any supplies.

1729580,5,B000068TSI,"Knowing some of the people involved with this true story and having met General Harold Moore and Joe Galloway a few years ago I felt a necessity to see the film as soon as possible (ASAP). I had read their co-authored book We Were Soldiers Once and Young so I already knew what to expect of the film. I knew that neither he nor Joe wanted just any Hollywood company to turn their book into a fiasco. They wanted the truth told and shown so Americans could learn about one particular unit and the major battle they fought in 1965.
I knew that Mel Gibson was at Fort Benning, Georgia (GA) preparing to make the film. I also knew that they moved the film crew out to Fort Hunter-Liggett in California for the actual battle scenes. I was aware that the producer, director, screenplay writer and company involved with making the movie had also done ""Braveheart"" which won five Academy Awards a few years ago. I felt they would stick to reality rather than sugar coating the true story. While some things were changed to make the movie from the book most of it was as real as possible.
The movie began by showing French soldiers being massacred in June 1954 in the IaDrang Valley by the North Vietnamese. This valley became known as the Valley of Death and was often compared to GEN Custer's battle at the Little Big Horn. This was the first intense battle scene of the film but it was far from being the last.
Although this film was about the IaDrang Valley battle of November 1965 it also showed the public much more. It gave you the opportunity to meet certain characters up close and personal. It shows the wives, families, how they were affected and how these women helped each other during this time in history as well as their spouses and children.
On Sunday 14 November 1965 the 1/7, made up of about 400 US soldiers, arrived at Landing Zone (LZ) Xray and soon found themselves up against more than 2000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers. For the next three days the soldiers battled the enemy. Precise times and locations were scrolled across the bottom of the screen. This entire part of the film is very intense. There were firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and bombing missions, which were so close to our own men that there were friendly fire casualties.
As darkness engulfed the battalion things got worse. LTC Moore walked among his soldiers reassuring them and telling them they did well to that point and to continue. Casualties were mounting. Moore was seen several times praying over the dead and wounded members of his battalion. This showed his compassion even more for his men.
As word was spreading back home of casualties the wives soon found out that the Army was not prepared for this. Taxicab drivers were delivering those dreaded telegrams. For whatever reason it showed that there were no chaplains or counselors there to handle this process. I don't recall that ever really happening so I'm hoping that was just a little bit of the Hollywood effect put on the film. Whatever the case was, in this movie Julie Moore took it upon herself to deliver all the messages to the spouses of her husband's soldiers.
Meanwhile Joe Galloway knew that there was heavy fighting going on and he jumped onboard a chopper to go see for himself. Armed only with several cameras he goes into the heat of the battle. When asked why he was there Galloway said to help the people home understand the war by shooting pictures not a rifle. More air strikes are called in and one of the men Joe came to know briefly was badly burned. He carried him to a waiting chopper. This was a rather gruesome scene.
The second and third days of battle weren't any better. The NVA kept bringing in fresh troops as our soldiers were trying to continue the battle themselves. LTC Moore asked for a head count of his men and when he found two were missing he went out himself looking for them.
As Joe Galloway continued shooting pictures Moore said ""I'll never forgive myself that my men died and I didn't."" Joe commented, ""I don't know how to tell this story."" And Moore's response was ""You got to Joe. Tell them how my troopers died.
""LTC Moore refused to leave the IaDrang till all his men living or dead were taken off the field of battle. He kept his promise although 234 of his troopers died. LTC Moore wrote personal letters to each deceased soldier's family. His compassion continued throughout the next 235 days his battalion was in Vietnam and to this day.
Before the credits rolled there was a brief narration about how our soldiers returned home with no bands, flags, or welcomes. The soldiers knew they fought for each other. The final scene was one of two soldiers, one in a wheelchair, going down what appeared to be an airport hallway. A woman with her children approached them and she pulled the children away from the soldiers as if they were diseased or something.
The names of the fallen soldiers of the 1/7 are listed on Panel 3 East of The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Moore and Galloway told their story well. Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson portrayed it excellently.
Though graphic in nature this is a MUST SEE movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions. I believe the film has shown what the IaDrang Valley battle was really like. Those people who may be squeamish about blood, burns, broken burns, etc might want to stay home. BUT if you are a true fan and prefer seeing war movies-this is the one to go to!

1729582,5,B000068TSI,"The DVD ""We Were Soldiers"" remains generally true to the book,
""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,"" by LTG Hal G Moore and Joe
Galloway. I was in the pipeline for SEA when that fight occurred
on my birthday. I knew some of the participants, one boy from
Big Spring,TX (KIA) and Galloway himself (from Refugio/Woodsboro,
TX). The truth of the movie is in the combat. The fight at LZ
X-Ray was brutal, near over-run, meet-your-enemy-without-mercy
combat. Each side was feeling out the other for strategic information, and each side learned how to fight the other, as would be proven over and over again for the next decade. The scenes of the red dirt at Fort Benning is true. The air mobile
concept is accurate, and the dedication and professionalism of
our Army early in the war is valid. All this would change over
time, at least in American perceptions, but Hal Moore and his
1/7th Cavalry was superb at LZ X-Ray. It is ironic that we learned how to fight the enemy early in the war, and then took
a hiatus from it until the war was lost.  The enemy learned and
maintained his dedication, knowing ahead what the cost would be.
But on November 14, 1965, a battle was fought that ought be remembered. Hal Moore won his fight, but his was only the first
half.  We lost the second half, which is not included on this

1729583,5,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is one of the best movies on the Vietnam War I have seen. It is an antidote to such cynical perspectives as Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. Those were all very well made films, but obviously colored by the various directors' politics in general and disdain for the Vietnam War in particular.
Nobody longs for war (except if you're crazy), but We Were Soldiers displays how men of integrity and with a natural patriotism will fight and die for their country. Based on the true story of the first battle between American soldiers and North Vietnamese troops in 1965, We Were Soldiers is useful in showing the very early stages of the war. We are given a bigger scope of the conflict in the opening segment which shows how the French were finally driven out of Indo-China in the '50s.
During the Cold War, the United States felt an obligation to fight against the spread of Communism and prevent the Domino Effect of South East Asian countries falling one by one to Communist control. So with the French gone, America made a stand in Vietnam, probably with the right motivations, but in a war that was to prove too costly in terms of lives lost and loss of national resolve back home.
But in this first battle, we get the feeling the war could have had a very different ending. An American air cavalry regiment under the command of Col. Hal Moore (brilliantly portrayed by Mel Gibson) is dropped off in enemy territory with orders to hold their ground. The North Vietnamese have the advantage of numbers, knowing the land, and with the high ground position. They come in waves against the American troops, but are fought back each time. These battle scenes are exceedingly well shot. You can feel the bloody shock of the close combat. At one point, a civilian war correspondent is unable to be an observer anymore and takes up a rifle alongside the soldiers.
The days of conflict are interlaced with scenes of the military wives back home, particularly Col. Moore's wife (the luminous Madeleine Stowe), as she takes on the burden of telling other women on the base when their husbands have been killed in action. These are deeply moving scenes. I applaud this movie for being able to incorporate the effects of war on loved ones back home in such a personal, non-political way.
We Were Soldiers also takes the courageous path of not refraining from showing Col. Moore's very real faith. He was a devout Catholic, and we see him in conversations and prayer with his family and a junior officer (Chris Klein, in a very pleasing understated role). Moore cares deeply about his men, a stark contrast to the self-absorbed, cowardly or mentally unhinged portrayals of officers we see in other Vietnam movies.
Likewise, the North Vietnamese soldiers are not caricatures. We see glimpses of them as human beings with loved ones too, and with an earnest conviction on the part of their commanding officer that their cause is just and that they will prevail.
I recommend seeing this movie together with A Bright Shining Lie, which could possibly be understood as an anti-war film, but which was valuable for its documentary type scope of the entire duration of the war, showing how incredibly short-sighted strategy, growing cynicism and even a senior military commander's personal life can shape the outcome of a war.",1072742400,6,3354,4.7844827586206895
1729584,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is possibly one of the finest war movies to date. It combines 3 elements that set it apart from many other war films: it details the lives of the families of soldier's in war, it shows the incredible resiliance of soldiers in the battlefield, and it convays the power of the sacrfice made for this country in a very realistic manner. I am a Chaplain Assistant in the 1st Calvary Division, the same unit of which is found in this film. Being very familiar with my unit's decorated history, I found this film's accuracy and honesty refreshing. I think that more people should be shown this film, in the hopes that they can see how great the struggle of war is: it destroys countries, friends, families, and people. And yet the American soldier has always stood strong, defending his country, protecting his comrades, returning loyally to his family, and honoring those who die in battle. The movie pays great testament to what we fight for. Please, watch this movie, and remember the American soldier. Your prayers and support is what helps us remember what we are fighting for out on the battlefield. Great movie, a must see! God bless America!!!",1072310400,3,1164,4.738916256157635
1729585,5,B000068TSI,"I just finished viewing this film, alone.  All these years later my wife cannot watch them.  She spent too many praying that her husband would be sent over.  Her prayers were answered.
To those experts who say that the combat was impossible to believe, the enemy would not come out in the open and fight in the fashion shown in the film, I trust that Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore would not let Hollywood get too far out of line in their dramatizations.
I also remember that in 1965 the North Viet Namese army was as arrogant and overconfident in their estimation of the American's as warriors as Robert McNamara was of the NVA.
This film captured the emotions and the horror of war as well as any I have seen.  It tells a story that could not be forgotten because it was never told.  The story of a commander leading troops into battle with courage and conviction.  The story of men serving their country with valor and distinction.
Want to know why we lost that one?  Notice the civilian who was more worried about ""keeping this under wraps"" when the battle was going the wrong way.  The rear echelon command that was ready to send them in without proper enemy estimates and then ready to pull them out without any thought to their men's exposure to enemy assault while trying to board helicopters.  This movie captures what went wrong.  The troops in action won and the command withdrew - all on the advice of civilian Think Tank pundits.

1729588,4,B000068TSI,"In this Vietnam war epic staring Mel Gibson, we are thrown into the very first confrontation between U.S and Korean soldiers. This is of course the famous ""vally of death"" battle.
Mel Gibson's character, Col. Hal Moore (not a ficticious character) leads his men into battle knowing that the Koreans are waiting for them. When you reach this part of the film, it gets good. However, the first part of the movie, consisting of Gibson training his new crop of men, and spending time with his family, is more fluff than anything. The hour long plus exposistion is what brings this movie down. Want to show that Gibson is a family man? Ok, but don't show it for near an hour. Nearly all of this time is needless (although not terrible), with the exception of a memorable speech by Gibson, where he states that: ""dead, or alive, we will all come home together""
However, if the hour long, quintessentially 60s exposition was shortened, this movie would be very close to Private Ryan (my favorite war film). The battle starts, and it doesnt end untill the movie does. In it, we get to see some of the most brutal footage ever captured, even compared to Saving Private Ryan. The scene in which napalm is dropped too late and torches a few American soldiers comes to mind; I may never get that image out of my head. That effect was too extreme for even my taste.
The battle is wonderfully shot, however. We get more character developement in these scenes then we do in the lengthy beginning.
See this movie before you buy it, because it is not for everyone. Some may be chased off by the extreme violence, others by the long first part. I however, liked the movie quite a bit, and consider it to be a good modern war movie.",1069459200,2,1713,4.511254019292605
1729589,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" manages to show the brotherhood between soldiers, the horror of war, and the commaraderie between the soldier's wives. The film is set in 1965, when America was at war with Vietnam. The commander of the air calvary is Lt. Col. Hal Moore ( Mel Gibson). Moore is a natural born leader and treats all of his soldiers like they were his own family. He is assigned to take his troops into hostile territory, to gain the upper hand. However, things do not go as planned, and the casualties start to mount. Back at home, Moore's wife Julia (Madeline Stowe) takes on the responsibility of keeping morale high for the soldiers' wives and handing out the death letters that are sent. The film is shot brilliantly and takes us back and forth between the two, to let us truly experience what happened.
""We Were Soldiers"" is one of the best war films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore's book ""We Were Soldiers Once.. and Young"". This provides for an amazingly accurate portrayal of the events that took place. The battle sequences are among the best that I have ever seen, and the camera work used was phenomenal(especially in the air). The musical score used was beautiful and one of the best that I have ever heard. But perhaps the best aspect of this film, was that it showed that there was more than one side to the war. Most war films only show American soldiers fighting and trying to win the war. This was the first war film, that took an in depth look at the Colonel of the Vietnamese army, and how he strategized. That was my favorite aspect of the film, because it put Colonel against Colonel. But it did not just show each sides strategies. The film also shows what both sides went through as well. We see that Vietnam was a country fighting to defend itself just like us, and like us, they also suffered. This gives the film a more well rounded feel to it.
""We Were Soldiers"" offers tons of star power as well. Mel Gibson shows once again why he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore is sensational. He gives an extremely accurate portrayal of the man, with his overall intelligence, his courage under fire, and his unending loyalty towards his troops. ""I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together."" Definately one of Gibson's best roles since Braveheart. Madeline Stowe is outstanding as Moore's wife Julie. The way that she keeps morale high with the soldier's wives is amazing. Very convincing role. Sam Elliot is very good as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley. Plumley is Gibson's right hand man, and never leaves his side. He is also very tough, and corageous under fire. Other fine performances were given by Greg Kinnear, Chris Kline, Keri Russel, and Barry Pepper.
Overall, this is one of the best all around war films that I have ever seen. The film is extremely realistic, takes an in depth look at both sides of the war, and has outstanding acting all the way around. The DVD is outstanding. It offers extremely nice picture and sound quality, that only makes watching the film even better. The extras are incredible. You get 10 deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, and commentary by director Randall Wallace. You will not be dissapointed with this film, and I consider it a must own.",1069459200,7,3330,4.579564489112228
1729590,5,B000068TSI,"I thought this movie was absolutley amazing. And this is coming from someone that does not like war movies. And believe it or not, I come from a military family. I love my troops to death but I have trouble watching war movies because they all seem to show all the gore, but none of the emotional depth behind those deaths. My father fought in Vietnam and didn't like to talk about it. However, this film made him talk to me about it. He felt the emotional and physical pain of the soldiers when they felt completely hopeless. Going into battle knowing you were completely surrounded but still wanting to fght for your country... that's what my father felt and that's what I felt. People can complain and complain until the day that they die that this war was useless, but the young boys that went to war knew that they were fighting for their country... for their right to live. Regardless of what they felt at the time, living in the USA meant more to them. So they fought for their lives, even though their backs were against the wall. Maybe I liked this movie more, because my dad went through the same situation... but regardless...
I thought this movie showed the courage and bravery that our soldiers had. Mel Gibson was incredible, as always. Chris Klein was someone that I thought that I could never take serious, but this movie proved otherwise. He showed me human interest, which I honestly thought I couldn't feel with him in it.
If you want to see a movie with honesty and raw courage, I recommend ""We were Soldiers"". And if you hate this movie simply because you hate the fact that the Vietnam War existed.... then you didn't really watch this movie. I do not think that war is always the answer, but... sometimes if you love the USA, then you've got to be willing to fight for it.",1067212800,6,1795,4.475609756097561

How many NVA soldiers died horrible, slow, bloody painful deaths?  How many of them had families?  In this film, they mostly all die offscreen.  When they're on screen, they usually perish while jumping from a huge explosion.  The Vietnamese commander is about as distant and trivial as possible.  More time is spent trying to establish an emotional connection with the CO's Wife.  What? And that's where this movie goes wrong.  It conveys chaos, maybe, but not fear.  The Thin Red Line, despite it's long running time (similar to this film) is much more effective in letting the audience develop a connection with the main characters and in showing why they act.  We Were Soldiers simply shows men getting slaughtered and trying to remain patriotic/hopeful until the end of the flick.  and what a TERRIBLE score.",1064793600,,988,4.838323353293413

Let's count a few. You have the leather-necked Gibson, heroically giving his best John Wayne, non-stop, without a single let-up, barely drawing breath between one OTT-tough mouthing off and another (probably setting a celluloid record for not appearing like a recognizable human being, let alone the soldier who wrote the original book). You have the air-cav soldier heroically dying after being caught in an ambush, smilingly gasping out in his heroic last words that ""at least I got to die for my country!"" You have the guy heroically throwing himself onto the grenade in order to heroically save his buddies. You have the cut-off squad, heroically waiting to be rescued by their heroic buddies, deep in enemy territory. You have the heroically gung-ho helicopter pilot with the stupid nickname who carries on and on heroically flying to save and supply the heroic guys on the ground. You have the heroic talk-over. You have the prayers and the speeches and the swelling music and the doe-eyed wives and fellow GIs and marines and whatever cheering on the boys as they nobly (and heroically) head off to battle to fight for their buddies and freedom...

I could go on, while someone passes me another sick-back, but why bother. Suffice to say that this moronic movie declares itself at the beginning as a tribute to the men who fought and died on both sides of the conflict. Sorry, but it's not. It's a patronizing insult to their professionalism and sacrifice and about as stupid and narrow-mindedly jingoistic as ""Pearl Harbor"". It's unworthy of their memory.

Col Hal Moore, commanding, puts in an outstanding performance.  Gibson is intense and true-to-life without overdoing the role (which would have been easy to do given the nature of the film).  This film does not glorify war, but does recognize the bravery (and flaws/weaknesses) of the soldiers who fought a hard, tough, thankless war because, in the end, it was their duty.
One thing the film does that most war films do not is focus on the home front, both before and during the battle.  Despite this, this is neither a pro-war or an anti-war story.  I thought that it did a pretty good job of recognizing both the skill and heroism of the soldiers on the one hand, and the tragedies that war inevitably entails on the other.  Unlike some other movies that have dealt with the Vietnam war, this film does not portray the American Army in a negative light, which is frankly refreshing, and perhaps reflective of the high esteem in which most Americans hold the military in the present day.

A few characters, particularly the narrator, are redeemable on more than just a stereotypical war hero level, and there's even a nice little scene where Mel writes a letter to a fallen NVA soldier, who must have been at least part human since he wrote stuff in a diary.
The film has potential as a compelling war movie, and there are brief sparks of this throughout. The majority of the execution falls flat.
Let's run through the list of stereotypes: we've got good ol' Mel, trying his gosh-darndest to not leave a single man behind; Mel's hard-ass SOB veteran major who's killed oodles of foreigners in other wars; the idealistic, loving, and coincidentally totally hot war wives; not one, but TWO naive youngsters with a future ahead of them and newborns at home who die (oops, did I give something away?); and of course, plenty of practically immobile Asians to gun down whenever slow-motion shots of American soldiers won't suffice.
At its best, the film starkly depicts the horrors of war; at its worst (which it leans towards for the majority), it's merely a by-product of sappy post 9/11 sentiments.

We Were Soldiers has pretty much all the good aspects a good movie need, let alone a good war movie. Not only does it show the hardships on the battlefield, but at home, also. It shows the problems the wives of soldiers have to go through at home. Like taking care of the house and children, and not knowing whether her husband is dead, or alive.
Mel Gibson, the star of We Were Soldiers, plays Lt. Col. Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion in the 7th Calvary. He says he will be the first to set foot on the field, and the last to get off. He promises he will take everyone home, dead or alive. The battle is most of the movie, and it is a good battle, too. It has its share of vietnamize deaths, and American deaths. But before the battle, you get to know some of the soldiers first, especially Mel Gibson, so you can care about them. Like when one of the soldiers dies, you won't be saying, oh well. The battle is realistic, like there isn't one ""clean"" battle scene. The battle scenes always have dust and dirt in the air, and the soldiers cloths are dirty, so its realistic in that view.

Moore and Joseph L. Galloway) its based upon occurred. My Grandfather served in the British Special Forces during the second world war, and in the army for close to 20 years spanning before and during that war. I guess, my interest in his war time experiences, (which left him with some terrible physical and emotional scars), has ultimately led me to this incredible movie and the truly compelling book it's based upon, even though it is of another war and time.
When I watched DVD of ""We Were Soldiers"" recently, it totally stunned and blew me away. I wasn't simply crying as the film drew to an end, I found myself attempting to control the strong urge to sob, as the tears flowed freely. I also had found the tears came quickly through various parts throughout the film as well.
After watching it, I took a note of the name of the book, ""We Were Soldiers Once... And Young"", and went on line here and purchased it immediately. The book is incredible and riveting reading, and so very shocking and eye-opening to a 36 year old woman who has only ever known war through her Grandfather's stories. I find the book and its companion movie a truly poignant and moving account of love and courage and comradeship and incredible self sacrifice. The soldiers and other service men (and women) deserved far, far more than the limited recognition they received during and after Vietnam for their courage and self-sacrifice during the years of the conflict.
""We Were Soldiers Once... And Young"" is a book I believe all young people should read, in order to open their eyes about what their fathers, uncles, older brothers, cousins and fellow countrymen, (regardless of their country of origin - I live in Australia myself and many men [and women also] from here served in Vietnam), went through during this conflict, and what they had to do for each other in order to survive. This war may not have been popular politically, but that was not the fault of the servicemen involved in fighting it. These men simply did what they had to do to survive, and to try to keep their comrades around them alive. As Lt. General Moore says in his book... ""No greater love hath no man..."" (than to lay down his life for another). So very poignant and moving.
I feel privileged to have read his book, and to have seen the marvellous movie based upon it, and to have felt (to still feel) deep into my heart and soul the emotions and the love within them both. Deepest, sincere thanks to Lt. General 'Hal' Moore and Joe Galloway for putting down in print the stories of these fine, brave young men in combat. I highly recommend their book as essential reading and the movie as essential viewing.

1729619,4,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers, Randall Wallace's 2002 feature film about the three-day Battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, is perhaps the best Hollywood depiction of America's ""lost crusade"" in Indochina.
Based on Lt. Gen. Harold B. Moore and Joseph Galloway's non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once....and Young, Wallace's film version is a realistic and respectful account of the first major battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces in November of 1965.
Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, We Were Soldiers begins with the Vietnamese destruction of France's Mobile Group 100 in 1954, the same year that Diem Bien Phu fell and French involvement in Vietnam ended, paving the way for America's long and doomed intervention.  This opening scene is graphically violent yet serves to drive home its point - to show the determination of the Vietnamese to drive off any outside force, even if it means being ruthless.
We Were Soldiers, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Oliver Stone's Platoon, portrays its soldiers realistically and without the anti-military post-Vietnam War bitterness that permeates those two films.  (To be fair, both Coppola and Stone's movies are well made, and in the case of Apocalypse Now, that film is not really about Vietnam per se but rather a Vietnamized adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.)  Some viewers might even accuse Wallace (who wrote and directed) of having a right-wing revisionist slant, but in the featurette on the making of the movie, he points out that he was inspired to do We Were Soldiers when he read Hal Moore's comment that Hollywood has never gotten it right when it comes to making movies about the Vietnam War.
We Were Soldiers not only has respect and admiration for the U.S. soldiers, but it also depicts the bravery and sacrifice of the Vietnamese People's Army.  True, most of the focus is on the American troops and, unusually for a Vietnam combat movie, their families.  But I personally have not seen the North Vietnamese portrayed with this much respect in a movie - even though I know Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth is a movie that deals with the Vietnamese.
Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Moore with his usual earnestness, wit and warmth.  He allows us to see the human side to this very intellectual and dedicated soldier.  He is not only a very pensive officer who reads French history books about Vietnam and has various college degrees, but also a loving husband and father.  His scenes with Madeline Stowe, who plays his wife Julie, exude affection and true chemistry.  Also, the scene when Moore explains the concept of war to his youngest daughter is touching and tender. Rounding out the cast are Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper, Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.
The depiction of the battle at Landing Zone X-ray ranks among the best, if sometimes grueling, war scenes.  The movie captures the horrible yet mesmerizing spectacle of battle, taking audiences from the roller-coaster exhilaration of nap of the earth helicopter rides to a three-day life-or-death struggle between two determined bands of fighting men.
Paramount's Widescreen Collection DVD is, as can be expected, a basic offering in comparison to other studios' releases.  Admittedly, the root menu is flashier than previous DVDs from Paramount, and it does have director's commentary, two different Dolby sound settings, and the aforementioned making-of featurette.",1054425600,17,3471,5.114840989399293
1729620,3,B000068TSI,"The Japanese gentleman below is quite correct. Those who are not American, or who are not rabidly pro-American, might not like everything about this film, especially given the current political climate. There is a great deal of ""gung-ho"" in this film, which is absent from, say, Platoon. In fact, this is possibly the first serious Vietnam film since Green Berets not to hold a left-wing p.o.v. Thos who accused Black Hawk Down of being incrediblyt pro-American haven't seen We Were Soldiers!
Although the film ostensibly shows both sides of the conflict (unlike BHD), it really doesn't show the Vietnamese point of view, except to depict them as essentially like the Americans; which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it seems forced. A film like Black Hawk Down is, to me, much less discomfiting; it does not pretend to show both sides, and can therefore concentrate on other matters.
However, I would diasagree that this film is unrealistic in its depiction of combat. That was what war was like. The North Vietnamese might go down pretty easily, but that is becayse of America's superior technilogy. The body count really was that high!
Besides, Americans are going down all the time, too, and at a tremendous rate.
Not too sure about the close range of combat - that strikes me as a little dodgy, especially as the battle essentially takes place on an open field. I thought combat firefights were generally at 50 - 200 yards' range.
The combat in this film is undoubtedly superb. The platoon tactics and ambuscades etc., as well as airstrikes, helicopter missions and so on, are depict3ed with loving accuracy. I thought many of thge more spectacular shots were CGI enhanced, but no - even the cyclonic napalm attacks are 100% real! The uniforms are also very realistic.
Despite its gung-ho sensibilities, this film definitely does NOT glorify war. That should be made plain. The film is pretty much as anti-war as Platoon. The wounded men really look wounded; and some of the wounds are hideous indeed. Also, somehow the lack of a ""Private Ryanish"" grittiness to the film image somehow makes the carnage look worse. The litter and debris among the corpses really show how desperatr the fighting was in this battle - and how concentrated the fighting was, too.
However, there are downsides to this film. The dialogue is forced, and often plays on sympathies that audiences might not share. There is much forced emotion in this film. The film lacks some coherence, and the pacing is far from perfect. Often there is a sense of repetition in the combat, taking away from the adrenaline rush. Also, the story of life back home seems emotionally forced too, lacking any grit.
The lack of grit to the characters is possibly due to many of the characters' still being alive in real life. Given defamation laws, it isn't really possible to depict them with any flaws. Unfortunately, this makes even Hal Moore a little too perfect, a little unmemorable. The only character with any nasty traits that I remember is the guy who shouted at Snake (?) and nearly had a gunfight with him. He isn't even named.
Incidentally, one reason why this film lacks the angst of most Vietnam films is that it is a battle between regulars.  In the early stages of the Vietnam War, it was still a war of volunteers. Hence there are no guerillas or burning villages here. We Were Soldiers presents the point of view of a regular soldier, whereas Platoon presents the story of conscripts v guerillas.",1054166400,9,3478,4.816053511705686

As I said, the battle scenes are well choreographed and are very realistic.

1729625,4,B000068TSI,"I found the title of this movie to be very interesting.  I haven't read the book, so I can't verify this, but the title to me points out the fact that the soldiers in this war were, in fact, soldiers: most did not have much policy-making authority, and did not choose to engage in what many felt was an ... unnecessary war.  They were not involved in politics.  Instead, they were there to do what they had been required to do.  They were soldiers.  It also brought to the fore how non-soldiers, through chance, became soldiers themselves.
The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, and it is full of gripping scenes.  It helps viewers to get a feel for what it must have been like to be there.  When the soldiers are pinned down, surrounded, and outnumbered, it is a very tense film to watch.  In fact, the action scenes are uniformly good, and the acting is excellent also.  We Were Soldiers also points out some historical truths about the war that most don't realize, such as the scene when the soldiers are being taught how helicopters will be used to transport them into and out of firefights.  Most don't realize that this was the first engagement of its kind, and it's instructive to watch the soldiers react to the danger it presents.
...  From a purely technical standpoint, it provides some relief from the unadulterated action of the movie, much as comedy scenes in Shakespeare's tragedies do.  Second, it points out the effect that the war had on families of those called to serve, something that is not often mentioned in Vietnam movies.",1051747200,3,1555,4.635036496350365
1729626,5,B000068TSI,"This is possibly the best war related movie out with the exceptions of: Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. Those two movies are in a league by themselves. For this movie, I would rate this number 1 in the second tier of great recently made military movies. (I haven't watched many of the old ones so I cant and won't judge them in this category)

The main thing I like about this movie, is how it shows how war affects the military family. (The soldier, their spouse, and children) Nearly all military movies ignore that aspect. I grew up as a military bratt and served in the Air Force so I understand what military families go through. This movie shows that aspect wonderfully.

As for the war part, the battle scenes are done very well... very realistic. One thing I liked about the war part of this movie is that the movie not only focused on telling the story from the USA's point of view but also our enemies.

Basically, if this is one of those movies you have seen on the shelf and cant decide to watch or not, stop thinking about it and watch it. You won't be sorry. IF you have watched it before, well its great you came back for more.",1051660800,,1152,4.324074074074074

There were only two downfalls. The first is the switching of scenes to the women at home, it distracted from the rest of the story. The second is a lot more of a problem. During the climactic battle scene, I have one question. How is it that nobody heard the choppers? Bell helicopter's are very loud. I mean very loud. I'm talking being able to hear it miles away, let alone right on top of them. I realize in some movies, we're supposed to suspend disbelief ... to a point. But I just didn't buy this one.

1729638,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang : The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam"" was written by Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway. A bestseller when first published it is the story of the first significant engagement between American troops and the Viet Cong, which took place between October 23 and November 26, 1965. Moore was the commander of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, and Galloway was the only reporter present throughout the 34 days of the battle. The Battle of Ia Drang in the central highlands of Vietnam is considered the first time and place where helicopter-based, air-mobile operations were used in combat. However the technological advancements of war become secondary to the story of over 400 U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 of the enemy. Heroism under relentless fire becomes the true story of the book and the main virtue of this 2002 film from director Randall Wallace (""The Man in the Iron Mask"").
""We Were Soldiers"" assumes that the audience does not know about the book on which the film is based; it toys with the audience several times with setting up Moore (Mel Gibson) to be killed. Moore knows history and cannot help but wondering if he is also leading the 7th calvary into a massacre just like Custer in 1876; however, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) pointedly reminds Moore of that fact the colonel ain't Custer. The backbone of the story is Moore's promise to his men that he would be the first one on and the last one off the battlefield and not even orders from his superiors, who do not want to have an American lieutenant colonel killed during a massacre, are going to get him to break his word. But ultimately the entire purpose of this film is to provide a realistic portrait of ground combat during Vietnam and drive home the fact that these soldiers were not fighting and dying for their country but for each other. This particular firefight lasts three days and nights, 56 straight hours of nonstop battle, and time and time again you become convinced that none of these soldiers are going to get out of there alive.
The battle is juxtaposed with scenes of Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe), who is forced to deliver the telegrams announcing the death of their husbands to their widows because the Army was using taxi cabs drivers. Like a similar scene in ""A League of Their Own,"" such scenes violate our scene of propriety, ingrained in countless other war movies from ""The Fighting Sullivans"" to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" that the military has a moral imperative in sending officers out to deliver such shattering news in person. However, we end up getting the idea that these telegrams were being sent while the bodies of these men were still lying in body bags on the battlefield.
Hal Moore, who retired as a Lt. General, gave ""We Were Soldiers"" his stamp of approval as the first Hollywood film to get what fighting was like in Vietnam, which is good enough for me. Watching this film while American troops are again fighting and dying in a war on the other side of the globe makes it even more potent. The performances are uniformly good, with Barry Pepper as the reporter Galloway, who distinguishes himself both with his camera and an automatic rifle during the battle, Greg Kinnear as head chopper pilot Major Bruce Crandall, and Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan, the wife of a young 2nd Lt. who sees her husband go off to war right after she had given birth to their first child. My only major complaint about this film is that the score by Nick Glennie-Smith often overwhelms the scenes of battle with music that provides a discordant apotheosis. I can totally appreciate the idea of not providing heroic music, but what we have here goes too far in sanctifying the action. The blood and the guts being displayed by heroic actions and brutal deaths on screen do that without needing the music; just watch the ""Broken Arrow"" chapter for proof.
Before the final credits the film shows the names of the soldiers who died at L-Z X-Ray ; even more poignant is the fact that there names are inscribed on Panel 3 East of the Vietnam War Memorial, because there were so many panels that follow (70 in all inscribed with 58,000 names). Ultimately, ""We Were Soldiers"" avoids taking a political stance on the war beyond what is brought to the experience by the audience (the most political scene with Moore debriefed by McNamra & Westmoreland is one of those deleted). Moore's battlefield counterpart, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duong) is presented as a dedicated, competent leader (the scenes in his underground command post also provide us our clearest understanding of what is actually happening on the battlefield). When Moore looks at the diary of a Vietcong soldier who almost killed him, he finds a picture of a woman, who to my eye anyway looks like Moore's own wife. The symmetry makes it perfectly clear that the troops on the other side were soldiers too.",1050019200,17,4928,4.751458576429405

A major distraction from an excellent film was the Oliver Stone style fairy-tale about delivering death notices by telegram via a taxi driver only to be taken over by a military officer's wife.  That is an insult to the military service that I hope will be corrected.  Following my Viet Nam tour I was assigned duty which included Casualty Assistance Calls (CACO).  The notification required military officers and, whenever possible, Chaplain and Medical- Personnel even at places remote from military bases.
Keeping this historical fact in mind, the film remains a memorable event.

I was a Huey driver, like Major Crandall in this movie, and I was glad to fly for these guys, and also fly away, too!
The movie is not as well constructed as Joey Galloway's book, but, truly, that is another story to read before seeing this film.  Hal Moore's personality is sincerely conveyed, and the Fort Benning of that time comes across.  There are great portrayals of the stoic Army wives waiting that are for real; it is too bad that this era was such a tough time for all. I hope that Joey's and the General's wishes that more civilians understand the true story of the Vietnam vet continues to get accomplished.

War is Hell, and this movie shows graphic representations of the horrors of war as well as the brilliant tactics that can make or break a battle.
Soldiers fight for a number of reasons, but when it comes down to it, they fight for each other and they sometimes die so others among them can live.
This movie also shows the horrors that face the families of the soldiers who are on the homefront.  Wives of soldiers living day to day, fearing the arrival of a messanger bearing a telegraph that will tell of their soul mate's death.

1729644,4,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers,"" directed by Randall Wallace, tells the story of an air cavalry unit during the Vietnam conflict. Mel Gibson plays the unit commander, and Barry Pepper plays a journalist assigned to cover the unit as they face intense combat. Madeleine Stowe plays the commander's wife, who, together with other Army wives, faces intense challenges of her own back at home.
I found this to be a well made and thoughtful film; I especially admire the way the filmmakers tell both the story of the soldiers in combat and the interconnected story of their families back at home. Although some scenes seemed a bit forced and obvious, overall I thought the film was very moving. It has intense combat scenes, intimate human drama, and welcome touches of humor. The aforementioned actors are all excellent in their roles, but my favorite performance is given by Sam Elliott as a no-nonsense, battle-tested sergeant major. Elliott and Gibson have solid onscreen chemistry together.
The DVD version of the film includes deleted scenes that further flesh out the characters. There is also a superb ""making of"" documentary which gives many insights into the film's production. The director, actors, director of photography, visual effects supervisor, and others give fascinating perspectives on their contributions.

It's not one of those special movies that seem to stay with you, but for what it was, an action packed war drama with some interesting angles, it carried itself very well.  The action scenes, and there are plenty of those, are convincingly done.  The acting is solid throughout the movie and Australian actor Gibson puts in a typically good performance.  I applaud the movie's portrayal of both sides of the conflict.  It was refreshing to see the Viet Cong depicted as soldiers no less human than their US counterparts, and not vilified for being the enemy. The story of the wives back home running parallel to the main battle was a nice touch which provided welcome relief from the horror of the battlefield, but in it's own way was a stressful part of the movie.

He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good Southern gentleman turned soldier. There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town.

The Return to Camp Holloway was just exceptionally moving.  The debriefing just hit the nail on the head - although I understand the director's comment about not wanting to make it political.

I was a crewman on a helicopter like the one you will see inserting the troops, supplies, bullets, and removing the wounded and dead.  I liked this movie because, while it was about the First Cav, it was also about how the war was fought by use of helicopters when I was there.
This story is about the first time the North Vietnamise Army stood and fought with the Americans.  This is a story about how American forces - who were vastly outnumbered - were able to fight back again and again while doing what we do best.  Utilizing the best equipment in the world to cause much pain and suffering on the choosen enemy.
This story is also about the first major use of helicopters in battle against a strong, well dug in enemy force.  After the first group of troops were inserted, ground fire was intense.  The brave sky soliders kept comming back, by day and night, until the enemy withdrew and would fight no more.

Wallace made this movie and wanted it to be THE Vietnam film. He wanted to ""Get it right"". Now all he accomplished is nothing more than a technically stunning, but patriotic and truth-denying Braveheart in Vietnam film.
Don't get me wrong. This film is good. But it fails at telling the story of the Vietnam War. Totally.
There are nice approaches, but the general audience - who assumingly did not study the history of Vietnam - isn't told anything about the conflict, and how the USofA ruined Vietnam and the surrounding countries.

By the end of this movie I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  My uncle was in the vietnam war he was shot by a sniper fortunately he was not killed.  This movie is a must see for the adults of todays world.  What our boys went through over in the Ia Drang valley was a nightmare.  But the herriosm these men diplayed is beyond anything this world will ever experience again.  They not only fought for another country but they fought for themselves.  Lt. Col Hal Moore who is now Retired Lt. Gen Hal Moore resides in my home state of Georgia (Savannah) and I am proud to have this American hero reside in my home state.  I also ran to our local public library after watching this movie and rented the book We Were Soldiers Once and Young written by Hal Moore and a reporter who in the mist of all the fighting found himself right in the middle and had to lay his camera down and pick up a gun to protect himself and others, his name is Jeff Galloway.  If you have not seen this movie you must!  If you have not read this book you must!  Because I felt for me to see this movie and also read this book was a tribute to the men who died in the Ia Drang valley (the valley of death as it was formally called). Not only did these heroic men die in the Ia Drang Valley but they were accompanied in death by 58,000 of their brothers in arms.  This was such a tragedy.

1729662,5,B000068TSI,"WE WERE SOLDIERS is one of the most significant war movies of this or any other era. Director Randall Wallace tells the tale of the Seventh Cavalry (Custer's Cavalry) as it fought a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army in a battle that meant nothing in a tactical sense in the Vietnam of 1964.  There are two perspectives.  One is from an American colonel played by Mel Gibson while the other is from his adversary, a Vietcong colonel played straight by Don Duong, without the bucktoothed screechiness of a former generation's Asian army commander. Despite the different uniforms and political philosophies of both Duong and Gibson, they are more alike than each would probably care to admit.  Both are dedicated and experienced leaders of men and neither is willing to allow personal feelings to get in the way of the killing business that is war.
WE WERE SOLDIERS is seemingly no more than the tale of a regiment of soldiers that covers first their training for battle, then later the battle itself.  But as in many war movies, the complexity of the war is only slowly brought into focus.  Director Wallace, in addition to showing the Vietnamese side through many vignettes that parallel the strategy sessions of the Americans also shows the wives and families of the soldiers.  Madeline Stowe is particularly effective as Gibson's wife who knows only all too well that the fortunes of war are sometimes reduced to the cliche of insensate luck as the determining factor in who comes home in one piece and who does not.  It is she who takes on the onerous burden of delivering the telegrams of death to the wives of her husband's soldiers.  The large cast includes a sterling performance by Sam Elliot, as an experienced sergeant-major who helps his men retain both life and sanity in the insanity of hand to hand combat.
What emerges as a subtext is the unsettling notion that in combat the enemy often differs more from us by the color of uniform worn than by anything else.  The extremely realistic scenes of bodies being ripped to pieces make the viewer care that some soldiers are being killed by some other soldiers, while not particularly caring about the colors of their uniforms.  The 'We' of WE WERE SOLDIERS is a sobering reminder that we should be glad that killing is so horrible, else we might grow overly fond of it.",1044057600,,2338,4.764851485148514

The Battle Scenes: The battle scenes are some of the worst ever filmed. Vietnamese soldiers just jump into open firing range and fall over fakely. It seems like the Vietnamese are on a suicide rage than fighting. And there's way too much of this throughout the entire feature. And one Vietnamese soldier just runs strait at the Americans until Mel blows his head off. The Vietnamese are actually smarter than what you see onscreen.
The ""Family"" Scenes: Of all the bad scenes in this film I have to say these are the worst of them all. All the wives are there, one has a baby, the father of course dies along with others, and all of this results in a sappy crying fit. The other scenes contain 2 women walking around handing out letters to other wives about their fallen husbands all with the same predictable results.
That's all I have to say. Don't buy, rent, burrow or watch this movie. It's a complete waste of time. Watch a good war movie like Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, Platoon, or Apocalypse Now.

Did those things happen? Sure. But they were not the ONLY thing that happened. The war was fought primarily by average people in a totally fubar situation, created chiefly by our own government and its provincial myopia.

In the book, Moore traces a brief background about the Vietnam situation (French dominance, American involvment, the politics of it all). In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.
Also, I'm positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.

In fact, the fighting sequences are the one part of this film that's great. Obviously director Randall Wallace wanted to show the non-stop killing and unrest, but he does so at the expense of the rest of the story. Also, the subplot of the wives back at home is interesting but poorly placed. Wallace jumps from brutal killing to the peaceful wives in a way that seems obscure and awkward.

It gives back to all the soldiers who were there a good reputation that some have tried so hard to take away.
  I remember the young faces of the soldiers in the hospital confused and wondering why, this story may to some seem smarmy...but it isn't.  The movie shows courage, strength, fearlessness, under great duress, in situations where no one knew what to expect.

Viet Nam was an unpopular war, but the men and women who fought, lost their innocence, gave all they could, are the heroes. They deserve honor -- political issues do not enter the chain of command, but the knowledge of those in the war zones must be heard.

They're landed by helicopters right in the middle of a firefight and the men jump out of the helicopters immediately having to defend their lives. Their opponents are 2000 experienced North Vietnamese troops.  This story was very painful to watch.  The Americans were virtually surrounded and facing enemy soldiers who were seasoned and knew the terrain. There's realism about this film that makes the viewer see the true brutality of the battlefield.

Mel Gibson in the role of Moore did an excellent job of portraying a man who cared about his soldiers and wasn't too mucho to let them know.  Greg Kinnear in the part of a helicopter pilot and Sam Elliot as a tough career sergeant major were both terrific in their roles. The wives and children who were waiting back home where also shown which was a touching way to point out the humanity and real lives of the soldiers.

With almost no nod to the steaming domestic politics of the 1960s other than those that directly affect the soldiers and their families (or any contemporary politics either - how refreshing), ""We Were Soldiers"" does a pretty fair and honest job of exposing both the rubies and the warts of a combat soldier's life.  Thankfully, most of the gratuitous machoisms that the entertainment industry finds so entertaining in war flicks are absent.
The 1st Cav (the unit that is the subject of ""We Were Soldiers"") was the cutting edge of air-mobility for most of the Vietnam conflict - and, having served with the Gerry Owen bunch, they never seemed to loose their special can-do spirit.  Much of what was learned about combat assaults, extractions, coordination of multiple levels of tac-air, aerial rocket artillery, hunter-killer teams and highly mobile ground based artillery, was pioneered in real-time by the Cav and quickly shared with the Infantry divisions who deployed to SE Asia in the next year or two.  ""We Were Solders"" does a pretty good job of outlining the metamorphosis of 11th Air Assault at Fort Benning, Georgia into the 1st Cav, and it's subsequent deployment into Vietnam as America ramped up its ground efforts beyond the badly stretched Green Berets, and other military advisors.  (BTW:  The area, Kelly Hill, at Ft. Benning where the real 11th Air Assault was formed, was also the same area where much of John Wayne's ""Green Beret"" was filmed).
Special kudos also to ""We Were Soldiers"" for doing a pretty fair job of showing the sometimes harsh realities of the life of the military family (the rather sterile ""Top Gun"" is the only other recent film I can think of that has taken the time to try to explore the often forgotten heroes back home...).  The military family, regardless of the rank of the soldier, seldom enjoys the predictable, geographically stable character of their civilian counter-parts.  I remember those years well, and ""We Were Soldiers"" does a pretty good job of showing why military families get to know the local U-Haul dealer so well.  More telling, of course, is the burdens, frustrations and pure fright that come with having a loved-one deployed.  Those families didn't carry protest signs during the 60's, instead they carried letters to the mailbox - some will never know what a large part they played in keeping ""their"" soldier going.

""A Vietnamese actor branded a traitor by the Hanoi government and placed under virtual house arrest for appearing in an American-made Vietnam War film has broken his silence to call the charges against him ""ridiculous"" and ""cruel.""
""Don Duong, who played a Vietnamese officer opposite Mel Gibson in ""We Were Soldiers,"" and a refugee in  the 2001 film ""Green Dragon"" opposite Patrick Swayze, defended his work in a letter released this week by family members in California. Duong's relatives have said the 45-year-old actor has been placed under house arrest and restricted from traveling and could face jail time. ""We Were Soldiers"" depicts the battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam's Central Highlands in 1965, in which men from the 7th Air Cavalry led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore, played by Gibson, overcame a more experienced and much larger North Vietnamese force.""

The expressions of excited young men going off to war, is stunningly altered into those bearing great shock, sorrow, and death.  The women they left at home portray the qualities of 1965 ladies supportive of their husbands, no matter what.
Madeline Stowe, as Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife, unites the wives left behind on the base.  When the Army is unprepared to hand deliver telegrams informing the family that their soldier died, she takes over the task from the cab company that had been hired to do so.  Each telegram is poignant, and I was reminded that every soldier, nurse, doctor, civilian, everyone has a story.
This one is about the American men who fought the first battle for God and country in Vietnam.  The film begins with a disclaimer that it is not a reflection of personal or political ideologies.  To me, that statement generally means the studio must distance itself to avoid potential ramifications about an unpopular war.  Also, that I am about to see more truth than fiction, more questions than answers.
We Were Soldiers is intense, and I could only watch it in short segments.  I needed time to think, to understand, and to witness the horror of battle.  It is vivid -- when bullets hit bodies, blood spews from the wounds.  Friendly fire kills, and is only called friendly because the man behind the bullet or bomb is in the same army.  Napalm burns whomever is in the path, and flesh is charred to the bone.  These are graphically displayed, and accounts for the ""R"" rating at the box office.
The reality, especially looking backwards at history and knowing these men and women came home without a hero's welcome, stirs me deeply.  Honor and integrity are shown along with ""battle scenes once seen that can never be forgotten"" in words such as ""I will be the first one on the field and the last one to leave, and I will leave no man behind.""
Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) said he would never forgive himself because his men died and he did not in the La Drang Valley (the Valley of Death).  It is clear that in the end, soldiers fought to save each other as they obeyed orders.
We Were Soldiers, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, Behind Enemy Lines, Blackhawk Down, Flight of the Intruder, Platoon, and so many others are very important films; they are about historical events.  To me, the message about warriors is that on the field there are never winners, only survivors.
Five Stars.

Then I had the opportunity to see this DVD. While it was not completely true to the book, it is just as moving and more gut wrenching. My wife who does not like this type of movie was consumed and sickened by what happened to our soilders.
The movie allows you get a very good idea of what the battle was like and allows you bring the horror of war move clearly into your heart. If you can read the book first.",1036972800,9,641,4.05511811023622
1729696,3,B000068TSI,"Mel Gibson stars as Commanding Officer Hal Moore, in this war drama based on true events. The film details the lives of the platoon, and their battle in the Ia Drang Valley, against the North Vietnamese, the first major battle in the Vietnam War. We first see the troops training, and spending time with their families, until they are flown over to battle. The rest of the film shows the 3 day battle in graphic detail, while cutting the action, to show the soldiers families receiving the bad news that their husband/father has died. The films message is that these men in war, were united and fought for each other. Nothing separated them while they defended their homeland. The film shows the profound effect of the war on the soldiers families, not just the Americans, but also the enemies. This film is directed very well, we get beautiful aerial shots, and 360 degrees view on the battle field. Acting is also very well done. The war scenes, have graphic violence, but not as graphic compared to other war films. The only problem I had is that there wasn't much story narrative, just mostly fighting. This DVD has a commentary, deleted scenes, and a behind the scenes documentary. Anyone who is interested in military history will enjoy this, as it is very historically accurate. As well as any Mel Gibson fan will enjoy this heroic tale. 3 stars.",1036972800,5,1353,4.713080168776371

They were there because they were told to be there - thats all.there was no higher purpose - no great cause like in World War 2 or even the Civil War. These men volunteered for the US army to defend America, then found themselves hideously mis-used in a war that was none of America's damn business.",1036886400,8,664,4.277777777777778

1729699,5,B000068TSI,"In the latest wave of war movies between the line of Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line comes We Were Soldiers staring Mel Gibson as Hal Moore.
  Moore is a family man who is dedicated to everything including his men that he is ordered to send most to their final destination...Vietnam.  The year is 1965 and they have to protect and take over La Drang Valley also known as ""The Valley of Death"" as Moore and copany embark on this noble and suicidal mission they have one thing in common.  They are fighting not for America and not even for freedom but for eachother.  Mel Gibson brings out the raw emotion and the courage that is shown through out this movie.  A commander that had to be strong and brave and knowingly order thousands to their death.
  After this movie you see the other side of war you see what it is like to be the last and only one to see the whole thing alive and in one piece.  You see the courage that all the american men had to be in the war that they were in.  All the men were in one way or another married to eachother in combat.  Each of them had a common respect and courtesy towards one another and each wanted to see the next make it to the next day.
  ""Till death do us part"" is the message that you hear through out this film and even after death parting is no easier.  This film is one that I would highly recommend for the young and the old alike to watch.  Afterwards share and maybe if you are close to the Vietnam Wall, go pay a visit to those names that you have just seen on this movie and see what happens to you.  I know that you never knew them but I promise you will share in the grief that their families faced when they heard of their loved ones passing.",1036368000,3,1705,4.1057401812688825
1729700,5,B000068TSI,"This movie is by far the best Vietnam era movie made.

1729701,5,B000068TSI,"Technotactically, the film shows the fire-swept weapons battlefield but with a new twist; both sides have full automatic assault rifles; M16s versus ""AK-47s"" (AKMs); with a trigger squeeze a group of men bunched together can be cut down. Moore has anticipated this, and as Crandall flies in ammo boxes, the later loaded 5.56mm magazines are distributed by conscious effort of the leaders--he and Plumley---to keep a ""wall of fire"" between them and the enemy regimental headquarters they have stumbled onto at the base of a forested mountain in the Ia Drang valley. Gibson's time spent weapons handling with the Benning Rangers results in Moore's palm slapping the bolt catch on his M16 after every magazine reload like a professional Soldier, an efficiency us lefties have a hard hard time duplicating.
The need for responsive Close Air Support (CAS) by a slow-moving aircraft like the A-1 SkyRaiders that can drop napalm is something we lack in the present day; making it questionable how we will fare if given the long odds for survival Moore's men faced. We see the technotactical ploys of the enemy to flank, countered by Moore's massing, then the enemy's ""belt buckle"" hugging countered by Moore's ""mad minute"" which shows that conflicts are often won or lost in the minds of the Commanders. The Commander with the last remaining trump usually triumphs--in those dark days in the Ia Drang, Moore's ""broken arrow"" request for CAS and ability to feed fresh troops into battle by helicopter held together by his skilled on-the-scene, personal leadership won the fight.
After the battle, where Moore had acted with complete disregard for his own safety, he feels survivor's guilt as a moral man aware of his fallen troopers sacrifices and insists that someday AP photographer Joe Galloway tell the sleeping American public what his men did to protect their freedom and the price they paid; the genesis of the book and this film. Moore knows that if he does not act, his men will be as forgotten as much as they were ignored when they left---he will not tolerate this--he fights back---he just doesn't bring his men back home alive or to be buried; he brings them back home to our hearts so they will be remembered forever by every generation of living Americans when they reflect on the lives of peace they get to enjoy and how they must also be Soldiers even if they are young.
The film as all films are under a serious time pressure, has two huge flaws that can fortunately can be fixed by a ""director's cut"" using some additional scenes. As-is, the film may make you think that tactical AIRCRAFT did most of the killing and if our men-on-the-ground endured so much agony, their families endured so much grief, why not just leave our ground Soldiers out of it? If all war is; is the act of exploding and killing, why not just do it from the air as western democracies are won't to embrace as a panacea? This is the result of a misunderstanding that the film's scripting/editing creates; a lack of geostrategic perspective that was the true cause of the men being hastily sent in 1965. Unless I failed to hear the film clearly, we are presented that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent in as a symbolic gesture to prop up a faltering South Vietnam, when the truth is much more than that.
I believe a scene should be added where the two senior Pentagon officers point a finger at a map of South Vietnam and describe how its narrow at the Central Highlands near Pleiku and with the enemy massing somewhere there, they could cut the nation into two by ground maneuver. The scene where Moore and Plumley land and get their orders to seek and find the massing enemy should reinforce this point by a sub-title caption reading ""Assembly Area, X miles from Pleiku"" etc. to connect the fact that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent to counter the MANEUVER of the enemy from holding important ground not as just another way of killing enemies using helicopters and Sky Soldiers.
Another missing aspect of the film is that the Army was developing a light tracked tank called the AR/AAV that would be deliverable by helicopter but was not available at the time of the 1965 battle. The details of this are recounted by General Moore in General David L. Grange's ""Air-Mech-Strike"" book. The first scenes in the movie where Pentagon officers select Moore where they mention his experimental parachute work for General Gavin should be modified in the director's cut to bring up the fact that Moore had worked on the AR/AAV light airdroppable tank that could be lifted by a helicopter but its not ready and the situation in Vietnam is too critical to wait. The officers should remark that the Air Cav will have to fight with what they carry in their hands and on their backs. They should end by saying they hope it will be enough.
In this subtle way, the conclusion of the movie would be more accurate and not feed into the current aversion to using ground troops which results in enemies escaping, while providing the audience a valuable ""lessons learned"" that America must IMPROVE the WAY she sends her men to fight; by declaring war so the entire nation rallies behind the men spiritually and physically to include supplying them with ALL the tools they need--to include a light tracked armored vehicle so gatling guns will not be left behind as Custer did. If the weather had gone sour, the ""guns"" on the aircraft could not have flown to assist Moore in his successful stand---future Air Cav type units must instead land with their own gatling guns on armored mounts with lots of ammo to insure they can sweep the areas of ""indians"" and win the fight to come home again.",1036022400,3,5645,4.720364741641338

Well edited action sequences, fire fights, naplam drops as well as interpersonal relationships with loved ones. Gibson and Elliot know their craft and their power as actors-are not to be underestimated. The battles scenes are excellent-not short stunts-but long & tiring dangerous confrontations-that leave the viewer on the edge of the seat. And they are not exaggerated. Pretty true to the original events, from Novemeber 1965. GET IT. Watch the film then check out the Director's excellent commentary. You feel like a part of the team.

Second of all, this is one of if not the very first to show the extreme sturggles on the home front.  What some of the other reviewers describe as fluff, cheese, and boring, is pure emotion.  Just imagine if you got word that your loved one was killed, all of a sudden those ""fluff"" parts become incredibly powerful and emotional.
  War is hell, so simple yet so true. I feel that Randall Wallace succeeded with flying colors in bringing our the hellish nature of war.  Colonel Moore said it perfectly, ""'cause when [the fighting] starts ourselves is all we got.""  Randall Wallace then successfully showed the interpersonal relatinships between all who fought together.
  We were Soldiers will go down as perhaps the greatest war movie ever made and should surely break into the top 15 movies of all time.  The power will make itself trully known in the last 30 minutes, especially when you find yourself still watching the credits, mesmorized to the score, minutes after the movie ended.  You will most certianly gain a new understanding towards the ordinary soldier.

1729716,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is one of the best vietnam movies I have ever seen. I congratulate all the cast and crew who participated in this film, Mel Gibson did a fantastic job, as usual. Sam Elliot was an excellent choice for Plumley. Ryan Hurst, awesome performance as Sgt. Savage, outstanding and such realism, ""Remember the Titans"" is also one of my favorites. I really enjoy your movies, you portray your character with such feeling, a unique quality. I was grateful to see that the wives and families of the soldiers were given so much attention, an important aspect to include, not only were these men soldiers they were husbands, fathers, and brothers. The wives who lose their husbands and the children who lose their fathers are very crucial to the true understanding of this particular war. Forget the negative comments made by those who do not understand that concept, war is terrifying to imagine let alone live through. I remember as a teenager when my brother left to fight in Vietnam, my mother and I would make up care packages for him; and I witnessed first hand my mother's courage. I have seen the vietnam wall with my brother recently and he still gets teary. The things these soldiers had to do to survive is unthinkable, and then to come home to protesters calling them horrible names and not even appreciateing the fact that they put their lives at stake for someone else. It is the soldier who gave with his life; gave you the freedom to protest. The movie is based on a true story, and it is an outstanding account of what really happened in Vietnam. The bayonet charge was outstanding I have only seen that done in two movies, ""Gettysburg"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" both based on true accounts.

1729719,3,B000068TSI,"This was a good movie, but a movie with Mel Gibson, about Vietnam, demands special attention. Two things constantly bothered me, one silly the other important. First, Mel's Southern accent just did not work and I had to stifle a chuckle each time he tried to sound like someone from my home town. Second, the constant close-quarter, almost hand-to-hand nature of the fighting shown in this picture, in broad daylight, is inconsistent with everything I have come to understand about Vietnam and modern warfare. Modern weapons are so lethal that soldiers rarely get close enough to even see who they have shot. The American troops were constantly running around and standing up in plain view of dozens of machine gun firing NVA. That is not consistent with survival instinct or military training. So I challenge the technical accuracy of the movie on this point...Movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" express the dark side of that time, and there was plenty of it - - In total I'll take ""Blackhawk Down"" for shear intensity and the portrayal of the incredible professionalism of the US soldier. I'll take ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the acting and that incredible opening scene. And I'll take ""Braveheart"" anyday as far as Mel is concerned.",1034899200,,1242,4.975961538461538

1729724,5,B000068TSI,"Having watched this film now on two occasions I felt compelled to write a review. Yet having sat down I felt lost for words. How does one do justice to such a film as this ?
As a Christian I abhor war and all that it stands for. Yet having served in the military I appreciate all the values depicted here, not least the sacrifice and the bravery of all those who suffered and died on both sides.
This is a story that must be told. It must be told to the American and Vietnamese people whose soldiers fought on that November day in 1965 and the world must be made aware of the horrors that were faced on the battlefield in the Ia Drang Valley, known as 'The Valley of Death'.
Many might be unaware that this film is indeed based on a true story. A true story of a place in Vietnam where some 400 US soldiers found themselves isolated and surrounded by an opposing force of roughly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers and the ensuing conflict.
This is not a film for the squeamish. War is horrific, barbaric and full of butchery and the scenes depicted in this film portray these properties in no mean measure.
The film proceeds at heart-racing pace from beginning to end. The acting is absolutely superb. This film will no doubt rank as a classic amongst it's genre. The battle-scenes are as realistic as they come.
This is not a film that glorifies war, or that seeks to do so. It clearly seeks to tell a story. A story of the men who were there and the horrors that they endured & suffered and the casualties that were sustained. To it's credit it also includes the stories of the families, wives and children left at home whilst their loved ones faced the ultimate sacrifice..
One of the characters in the film, notably the battle scenes, is depicted as a photographer. Might I respectfully suggest that anyone with an interest in the historics of this battle, this war and the suffering of those involved, take some further time to examine a book entitled ""REQUIEM"". It is a book entirely devoted to the story of combatants such as these. A book devoted to the photographs of those war photographers who did not return. Photographers whose lives were also sacrificed in the process of bringing us the story of those soldiers who suffered.
This film will choke you and might very well bring a tear to the most hardened of viewers. We need to be aware of the horrors of such conflicts and ensure that we do all we can to prevent them. Highly recommended viewing.",1034812800,4,2459,4.466666666666667

I gained appreciation of how terrible the war was and how the lack of support from the U.S. people would put soldiers lives at risk.

It shows the early days of the Vietnam War from many perspectives, officers, soldiers, girlfriends, wives, and the man who wrote the book upon which the movie is based.  I wouldn't dare compare the two.  Suffice it to say, this film WILL change your mind about Vietnam, whether you were for, against, or neutral.  Also, given the actor and actresses involved, this movie could NOT have been made even 10 years ago--and we're the better for it.

This film tries at one point to show the story not just from the americans side, but our hero from the other side runs along in dramatic slow motion only to have his head blown off. Mel Gibson just seemed to be his usual self, with no emotion this time, I didn't care what happened to these characters which since it is a true story made me feel more guilty.

1729746,2,B000068TSI,"War movies must not be just entertaintment .They have to be made with more maturity and seriousness simply because they deal with history . We Were Soldiers is a decent effort by director Wallace to tell a part of the story of the Vietnam War . It's basic message seems to be this : both Vietnamese and Americans had great casualties , both of them suffered . Yet what it fails to do is to actually present the paranoia of war and the psychological situation those young soldiers found themselfs into .
  ""This is a war we will never understand "" says a voice at the beginning of the film and indeed it is . The US had send it's own kids to fight to an unknown country and to give their lives for a war taking place outside it's border , in a nation which didn't threaten the security nor the integrity of their homeland . Despite that though , the film has scenes of men dying on the battlefield while saying things like "" save those codes... i'm glad i'm dying for my country "" . These were young people full of prespectives and dreams who were facing the danger of not growing old , having children and live their lives they way they would want to , all for a war which on final analysis ... was not theirs . So how did they feel about being there ? Were they more patriotic or anxious and horrified ?
  It's been more than 20 years since Francis Ford Copolla had directed Apocalypse Now , the most horrific and challenging Vietnam story ever to be told . It hasn't even been a decade since Terence Mallick had made The Thin Red Line , one of the greatest war movies ever - a film which condemns war no matter who is fighting who - . We Were Soldiers is afraid to even touch subjects these films had deeply explored . Furthermore , Mel Gibson remains one of these few hollywood stars who are still unwilling to take a risk and play something else beside the hero or the cool guy while the Vietnamese share of pain is not even  being merely presented . It's understandable to want to honour the men of our country who lost their lives on the battlefield but what the world needs now is to actually face our history's mistakes and condemn war at every chance , even through blockbuster movies .",1033689600,2,2195,4.266826923076923
1729747,4,B000068TSI,"Finally there is a movie about the Vietnam War that puts the politics aside and tells the true story from the perspective of the participants, both combatants and those loved ones they left behind.  I did not serve in the Vietnam War nor, fortunately, have I ever been in combat, therefore I have absolutely no right to make judgements about how accurately the fighting portrayed in this film is.  However, I have read the book co-written by Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (Ret.) and Joseph Galloway and what I saw portrayed in the film was extremely close to what I read in the book.  Like the book, the film does not glorify war and violence, but it justifiably glorifies the courage and valor of all those who serve our country in times of war. This is not surprising since both men were consultants on the film.  The only real criticism I have is that because of the necessary use of time compression, there are times in the film when, if they have not read the book, the viewer may lose track of what is occuring where and when on the battlefield.  In closing I would like to say a personal Thank You to all the men and women who served the United States during the Vietnam War.",1033516800,3,1171,4.402777777777778

He shows that in order to be a true leader you must put your men first and always have their best interests at heart.  Moore/Gibson shows that he truly cared for his men and contrary to a ""by the book"" leader, he took a very personal interest in getting them all home.  They were his responsibility and he made sure that he was the first person in harms way and the last person to get to safety.
  Kind of funny...in a way this is a love story, not about the kind of love between a man and a woman but rather about the love comrades in arms have for each other, the kind of love only they can truly understand.

1729749,5,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers released in 2002 is based on the factual events that occurred in Vietnam in 1965.  The writer/director Randall Wallace captures all sides of war in this movie.  Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Colonel Hal Moore who is in charge of 395 U.S. Air Calvary men who are being shipped to Vietnam.  He is the leader of the 7th Calvary, the same Calvary number as Custard.  Madeline Stowe plays his wife who has to face her own challenges while he is out to war.  This film is based in Vietnam where these men are involved in a new type of war involving helicopters.  It illustrates what the U.S. Air Calvary, the Vietnamese Army, and what these soldiers' wives are going through during this battle.  This movie shows Lt. Colonel Hal Moore as a father figure who has much religious faith.
The U.S. Air Calvary must go against all odds of being outnumbered by the Vietnam soldiers.  This movie was very intense and focused as much on the individuals in the battle as the battle itself.  It portrays the courage that all of these characters had.  Madeline Stowe had the horrendous task of informing the soldiers' wives of their death.  She knew that her own telegram could be coming, but she still went on day after day delivering them.  This movie even had a group of men lost, against all odds they found ways to survive surrounded by enemies.
This movie was very graphic and would not be recommended for young viewers.  It would make any person want to go out and join the army.  These soldiers were faced with many odds and like many times the government doesn't want to let on how intense things really were over there when this battle was happening.",1033344000,4,1653,4.559322033898305
1729750,2,B000068TSI,"Synopsis: We Were Soldiers tells the story of the first large-scale battle between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese, November 14-16, 1965, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The fight was also the first test of our Army's brand new ""air mobile"" tactical doctrine, which would become a signature of U.S. troop deployment in Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (George Custer's old outfit), were inserted by helicopter into the Ia Drang Valley, where Army Intelligence suspected that North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units were headquartered. What Moore and his men didn't know, but were about to find out, was that several NVA divisions - numbering thousands of troops - were waiting for them in the Chu Pong Massif overlooking the Ia Drang. After three days of constant, fierce fighting and severe attrition to both sides, the North Vietnamese broke off the engagement and left the field to the Americans.
The movie follows Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), as he prepares his green troops for Vietnam, then chronicles their bloody struggle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang. It also highlights the effect of the struggle on the families left behind, including Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and children.
The Good: We Were Soldiers benefits from the talents of such likeable stars as Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and of course Mel Gibson. It also devotes some time to the North Vietnamese view of the battle, which is unique and welcome.
The Bad: An instructive comparison can be drawn between We Were Soldiers and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. Both are based on true stories of Americans who faced battles against long odds and prevailed through skill and courage. Whereas Black Hawk Down hews very close to its unflinchingly objective source material, though, We Were Soldiers pulls out all the stops to manipulate our feelings. Randall Wallace, who shanked one last year with Pearl Harbor, errs even more grievously this time with a cheesy script and heavy-handed direction. His players are good, but they can't save this one. Shame on Wallace for failing to do justice to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's moving yet unsentimental account of the battle.
The Bottom Line: The Vietnam War has produced a remarkable crop of great films. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. Read the book instead.",1033344000,9,2353,4.989821882951654
1729751,4,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is a movie about the Vietnam Conflict that shows the first major engagement between US soldiers and the North Vietnamese Regulars.  The movie does an excellent job potraying the events of the first skirmish of the Ia Drang battle in 1965.  There are a few shortfalls though.  I have never been to Vietnam, or seen the real Ia Drang Valley, but Vietnam portrayed in this movie looks like California to me.  I was also dismayed at the Hollywood style ending of the movie.  I beleive that the screenwriter, who also happens to be the director, should have stayed true to the book.  The entire Battle of Ia Drang was over 35 days, whereas the movie only shows us the first three days.  Thus, the viewer gets a falsified sense of victory out of the movie.  Consequently, the movie is a good war movie; I would put it in my top 5 favorite war movies.",1033257600,,861,4.439490445859873

I'm a contemporary of the Vietnam veterans, and this film really drove home the suffering, the fear, the horror many went through on behalf of an indifferent, sometimes hostile nation. The film really attempts to humanize both sides in the battle. This isn't an old 1950's 'fearless Audie Murphy slaughters thousands of the enemy as they charge his position' kind of war movie. Yes, there are lots of gory special effects.  But the real message is 'These were men who did what their country asked of them, despite the risk.

1729754,2,B000068TSI,"In the first conflict between the US and North Vietnamese, a few hundred troopers found themselves hopelessly encircled by over 2,000 NVA troops, and ultimately smashed their way out with a suicidal charge straight into enemy ranks.  Great war story, poor movie.
Gibson's performance as Moore is excellent, but most of the movie is the action that took place at Landing Zone X-Ray and the knoll in which several soldiers found themselves pinned down.  Except for some disgusting moments (skin slipping off of flesh, people being burned alive, etc.) aided by excellent visual effects, there really is nothing new here.  The gory action is surprisingly lackluster and routine, especially when compared to the sheer intensity of Saving Private Ryan and the brilliantly-photographed all out chaos of Black Hawk Down.
Another complaint is the pointless scenes of the wives back home, which serve no purpose other than to try a jerk a few tears.  Portraying grieving wives in this type of war movie, which is basically about survival, is totally innapropriate.
Of course there's the flagwaving and cliched talk amongst the troops which is fairly standard nowadays, and that detracts from the realism and brutality.  It's as if the director didn't know which movie to make: a shocking ground level view of combat or a Pearl Harbor-style teen flick.  Very uneven.
If you want the ultimate war story about troops who are outnumbered, outgunned, and emerge victorious despite overwhelming odds, see Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down.'  For a great all-around war movie, watch Spielberg's Private Ryan.  For a great Vietnam movie, watch either Hamburger Hill (very realistic and gritty, not in the least bit flowery) or Kubrick's brilliant 'Full Metal Jacket.'",1032998400,4,1747,5.214285714285714
1729775,5,B000068TSI,"Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time... These poor guys were in a world of hurt from the time the hit the ground.
This is a really good film. The authenticity and attention to detail are phenominal. All the way from the French in 1956 up through the actual battle that US 7th Cavalary was in. Wow!
The attention to the detail of how the soldier's wives had to cope with the deaths. It must have been a terrible time. The US Army did not handle it well.
395 American GIs against 4,000+ North Vietnam regulars. These weren't the Viet Cong that you normally see in films. The regulars were well equipped and well trained. Their officers knew the ways of war. This particular NVA officer had been in nearly constant battle since the Japanese occupation in the 1940's.
Gibson and Elliot were superb in their roles as the two American leaders. I can't imagine going into battle knowing that you only have airlift capability for 60 soldiers at a time and having a 30 - 40 minute gap between air drops. One sustained firefight and you would burn through all your ammo... If you were wounded right when you jumped out of the chopper, it could be more than 90 minutes before you were evacuated. Nothing good about that...
The first 40 minutes was introducing the characters and showing you how the unit was trained. This was America's first ""Air Mobile"" unit. New tactics and doctrines. This was the first major battle in the Vietnam Conflict. Once the unit hit the ground, the battle was on. The whole rest of the film concentrates on the battle. No let up in the action.
I watched the DVD. Plenty of excellent special features on this one. The section on the makeing of the film was especially interesting. Interviews with the survivors, how they created the battlefield, the weapons involved, the aircraft, the explosions... Very good. The director spent a lot of time getting it right. The veterans seemed to be satisfied with the accuracy. Other special features included director's commentary, deleted scenes, movie trailers.
But, when it all said and done, you don't walk away from this film feeling good. It was a major battle. Both sides declared it a victory. Neither side stayed and held onto the ground. A lot of men died. A lot of brutal close up in your face fighting. It was filmed in the same style as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and A&E's ""The Lost Battalion"".",1032998400,3,2378,4.624113475177305

1729777,5,B000068TSI,"I was very impressed with ""We Were Soldiers"", the story of the first major conflict between American soldiers and the Vietcong.  The film, written for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, and starring Mel Gibson in one of his best roles ever, is an unconventional look at war, especially the Vietnam War.  Rejecting the ambiguity and claustrophobic horror of such classics as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Platoon"", it presents an almost worshipful look at the American soldier, sure, but it gives us a reason to label these men heroes.  It is a simple, but poignant, glance into the brotherhood of soldiers as they fight to stay alive in the midst of absolute horror.  ""We Were Soldiers"" shows that war is hell, but it doesn't lose itself in it.  The benefit of 30+ years has allowed filmmakers to look back on this horrific period in history with some perspective.  What I like about ""We Were Soldiers"" is that it doesn't even attempt to justify our presence in Vietnam, but it vilifies no one.  The Vietcong are presented as men who believe in what they're doing as much as the Americans, if not more.  This might be one of the first films to attempt to provide an objective view of the ""enemy"".  It was refreshing; there's been enough propaganda in the media.  I'm tired of being told how to feel about Vietnam.  ""We Were Soldiers"" takes the viewer right into the middle of combat, in a manner similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"".  The bullets whiz past OUR heads, the screams of the wounded and dying fill OUR ears, the heat of the explosions burns US.  Randall Wallace's direction is very evocative; I found myself trying to slink down like the actors.  Speaking of actors, this film has got some good ones.  Mel Gibson is superb as Col. Hal Moore; he embodied the role like he was born to play it.  Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and others were similarly outstanding.  I also appreciated the portrait of Army wives; the sequence in which Madeleine Stowe (Moore's wife) and Keri Russell (Chris Klein's wife) hand-deliver death-announcement telegrams to the wives is devastating.  There are some standard war movie cliches in ""We Were Soldiers"", but overall, I thought it was an impressive achievement.  My dad, a Vietnam veteran, agreed.",1032912000,5,2273,4.782051282051282

It also brought home the story of the wives who waited for their husbands to return or not to return from battle which I felt was an important potrayal.
I was hesitant to purchase the DVD as I didn't think that Mel Gibson was the proper pick for the lead but was I wrong. This was well beyond his Braveheart and Patriot roles.

1729781,5,B000068TSI,"""Saving Private Ryan"" redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  ""Black Hawk Down"" took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.
""We Were Soldiers"" is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood.  In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.
Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.
Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary.  However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like ""Pearl Harbor"", which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.
The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men).  Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.
Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in ""The Contender"" with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.
This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since ""Full Metal Jacket"".  I rated it a 10/10.  This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.",1032739200,8,3351,4.9552772808586765
1729782,5,B000068TSI,"I have to confess that I wasn't quite prepared for this film. I was expecting something at least decent, but instead saw what I believe to be one of the best war films that I have ever seen.
This is the latest in a string of films that attempts to make the combat sequences as accurate and as life like as possible. I have read a number of books about wars, warfare, and battle, and in them one constantly reads about the amount of smoke that there is on a battlefield. Most films take cinematic liberties, however, making the battlefield as clear as possible in order that the viewer can follow the action. In WE WERE SOLDIERS, however, much of the battle takes place is an artificial fog.
One of the best things about this film, as opposed to other battle films, is that you get to see how the battle looked from both sides. The Vietnamese are not presented as faceless, almost inhuman forces as in most films, but we get to see them as human beings, and their own strategy and tactics are displayed. One shot in particular stood out for me. A Vietnamese soldier pauses in the hollowed out part of a tree, breathing hard, changing the clip on his rifle, and then putting on the bayonet. Then, he stands for a second, battling his fear, before forcing himself to move from cover and attack. You can probably count the number of war films on one hand that would have portrayed the enemy in such a human light.
The film as a whole, despite containing some very intense battle sequences, is as concerned to focus on the human dimension as much as the military. This may be the most purely emotional war film that I have ever seen. It is also filled with many individuals acts of moral courage, such as when Col. Moore's wife demands that the cab company deliver all the telegram's from the war department to her instead of the individual wives, telegram's that informed them of their husbands' deaths.
The cast was, for the most part, excellent. Mel Gibson was as solid as usual. Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him. He has been thoroughly enjoyable in everything I have seen him in. Sam Eliott has always been on of my favorites, and he stood out in this one as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley.
A very good movie, and while I would caution that it is very, very violent, and graphically so, I would also urge anyone who has been putting this one off, to give it a try. I think they will be moved and astonished.",1032566400,,2489,4.42483660130719

1729784,5,B000068TSI,"This film represents a wonderful example of how well Hollywood can sometimes transform the truths and spirit of a book into a moving and inspiring experience. It is a terrific period piece in the sense that it captures the essence of a now long-gone spirit of concern and empathy that older and compassionate senior officers had for their soldiers. Mel Gibson seems to be aging very well as evidenced by his wonderful characterization of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, a career Army officer who lives both fully and well, but who is at the same time also totally devoted and committed to meet the responsibility he's entrusted with in terms of the welfare of his officers and men.
The movie, based on the historical fact of the first large scale engagement by American soldiers with the regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA), as opposed to the clashes with the guerilla-style Viet Cong later on, traces the extensive training and preparation of the regiment in the experimental use of helicopters to transport soldiers rapidly into enemy-held areas. The risks associated with this new style of tactical warfare quickly becomes apparent; eight to ten serial efforts are required to fully mobilize the unit, and the men first dropped find themselves dangerously exposed in the event a vastly superior enemy force engages. Of course, this is exactly what happens, and the brutal exchange that then ensues is the backdrop for the movie.
Over a period of some five days, the encircled American forces lose almost half their personnel, yet are able to kill more than 1,800 of the attacking Vietnamese soldiers. Seen in the cold light of day, this exchange becomes a de-facto documentary on the inherent risks of combat, and the quicksilver nature of modern warfare. The cast helps here, for veterans like Sam Elliot (as the Sgt. Rock-like Sergeant Major) and Barry Pepper (as the UPI reporter who forges a life-long friendship with Wallace and helps to write the book) add to the sense of gritty reality the film captures so well. Madeline Stowe is also very good as the enduring wife of the Colonel who also acts to lead the women of the organization in the men's absence. Like another recent movie, ""Black Hawk Down"", this film helps to de-mystify modern warfare without glorifying or judging it. This is a wonderful film, and one I heartily recommend.

The movie used direct quotes Lt. Herrick and Jimmy Tokagowa (sp?) as they died, that's exactly what they said according to Hal Moore.  Perhaps he should apologize for the dying soldiers who couldn't come up with something more clever to say as they bled the ground red.  Critics who charge this movie as inaccurate need to read the book.  This movie follows it accurately and warmly.  In fact, if you like this movie, you will like the book it came from.  The N. Vietnamese were slaughtered in wave after wave according to the book, often charging directly at soldiers.  Lt. Herrick's platoon on the knoll reported seeing soldiers standing up in the brush just to laugh at them.  They were often shot by our forces.  Besides, what do any of us writing these reviews know what that battle was like?  Were any of us in the 7th cavalry that day?  This movie is excellent.

A wonderful moving account of the men who had to fight on the ground with little understanding of the situation by the brass behind the desks. I think that this movie should be required viewing on leadership principles in the military, much as ""12 O'Clock High"" was some 20 years ago.
A terrific movie... and splendid acting by Mel Gibson.",1032307200,4,501,4.28421052631579
1729827,5,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is based on the factual events that happened in 1965 at the battle of Ia Drang Valley. I've heard it said that this is one of the better war movies, and one of the best Viet Nam movies. I'd have to agree. Mel Gibson puts in a stunning performance (as usual) at Col Hal Moore, the leader of the 1st battallion, 7th calvary (Custer's unit). Greg Kinnear has a great performance. Barry Pepper does a wonderful job as Joe Galloway, the reporter who was there in the fight. And it is great to see Sam Elliot again, in a role that seems tailor made for him. And many other actors put in great performances. It may have helped that Hal Moore, Joe Galloway, and Bruce Crandall (Kinnear's character) were there to help guide the filmmakers. This movie also spends time focussing on the soldier's wives at home, where Madeleine Stowe and especially Keri Russell and Simbi Khali (not much screen time for Khali, but the few minutes she was on, she was phenomenal) do a great job. You don't too often see the effect at home, but you do here. We Were Soldiers also portrays the enemy as soldiers and honorable men, instead of the stereotypical '...' shown in most Viet Nam movies. And as much as I like movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Casualties of War, it is nice to see the soldiers portrayed as soldiers doing their job rather than the psychos, drug addicts, and the likes shown in other movies. This is what Speilberg was hoping for when he made Saving Private Ryan. Randall Wallace (writer/director) teams up again with Gibson. These guys made Braveheart together, and We Were Soldiers is almost as good. The effects are good, and William Hoy does such a great job editing, I think he deserves an Oscar. Nick Glennie-Smith scored the movie, and his work doesn't detract, nor is it swallowed up by the action. This is just an overall great movie.
And the dvd is a good one also. There is a commentary track by Wallace, and while it isn't the most entertaining I've watched, he does a good job (I do wish Mel Gibson had been on the track with him). There are numerous deleted scenes and a 20 minute behind the scenes documentary, ""Getting it Right."" It's a good dvd.",1032134400,9,2185,4.506297229219143

Overglorified battles when actual combat in Vietnam were chaotic skirmishes... it looked like a civil war battle with all the Vietnamese charging blindly and falling by the dozens... riiiight. There is a laughable scene where Mel spins around and miraculously shoots a Vietnamese character when he comes a little too close to the group of American officers.

Gibson's character is depicted as a compassionate family man and an officer who vows to physically lead his men into battle.  When he arrives in Viet Nam, he and his inexperienced troops are sent on a mission which is almost doomed to failure because of the inequality of their numbers compared to the Vietnamese.  As the battle rages and men fall, scenes are shown of their wives receiving the telegrams which inform them of their husbands' deaths.  The viewer learns to care about these men and then sees many of them killed in combat.

99% of VCs die by charging straight into American sights. Of all the war movies I seen recently this one takes the cake for the worst action sequences. Everything just seems so Hollywood and FAKE. Its like they didn't even try.
I thought the battle took place in Vietnam? The terrain looks like it took place in a glorified paintball park.
The VCs are cartoonist extras from Rambo. They spend most of their time dying in the most idiotic way possible or barking at each other with their stereotypical and hilariously over the top acting. If this is Mel's attempt to humanize the enemy then he failed miserably.

So from that perspective, I think this was a little too patriotic and the timing kinda sad as well. It's like the movie makers assume we have no idea that Vietnam was largely about money and resources ... The other strange assertion the movie makes is that this is supposedly the first battle that ever took place between Americans and ""Charlie"". ...
One thing that did actually have integrity, and was in a way the basis for the movie, was the viewpoint from the average soldier as the war started. He thought to himself ""I'm fighting for my country, I'm scared but it's for a good cause"".

Not just because it was based on a true story, although that adds to the effect, but mainly because this movie hits you at all levels of human existence.  It is not just a movie about a battle, but about wives, children, friends...all affected by war.  About Fathers who kiss their children and wives good-byein the middle of the night, and wake up the next day fighting for their lives.
When I finished watching this movie at midnight, I walked to each room and kissed my children and my wife, then wept for another half-hour.  The music will haunt you, the scenes will replay in your head for days, but events of that November in 1965 will never be forgotten.  Thanks to Col.

1729856,5,B000068TSI,"While I have never served in the military, military tactics, weapons, and history have been a hobby of mine for most of my life.
""We Were Soldiers"" is easily the most moving film I have ever seen.  It is touching in a way no other film I have seen is; the movie is less about the battle than it is about the soldiers and their families.  The film is wonderfully uplifting, valueing ardent religious faith, morality, and strong family life, which lets the viewer relate to these young men, their wives, and their children in a very real way.  It was also refreshingly devoid of any political message.  Every vietnam vet. I have talked to about this movie found it very accurate, and deeply moving.
Some reviewers, both professional and on this site, have criticized ""We Were Soldiers"" for coming up with ""contrived situations,"" such as a very touching scene when Lt. Col. Hal Moore has to explain to his young daughter what a war is.  The fact is, that this scene actually happened nearly exactly as it was protrayed in the film, the only real difference being that in the film it occured several days before Moore shipped out, while in real life it happened the same night he was leaving.
People have also claimed that the battled, filmed in the hills of Northern California, looks nothing like the central highlands of Vietnam.  The truth is, that when (ret.) Gen. Hal Moore saw the location that had been picked for filming, he said it looked almost exactly like he remembered it.  Not all of Vietnam is rice patties and jungle.
(Ret.) General Hal Moore served as a consultant while this film was made, and was actually on the set during much of the filming.  His presence ensured that the movie is very accurate to what really happened during that first American vs. N. Vietnamese battle.  Much of the dialogue in the movie is lifted directly from the Hal Moore's book, so many of the lines were actually spoken by  the soldiers during those terrible 57 hours.
I cannot recomend this movie highly enough, but watch it with a friend or family member, as you will want to talk about what you've just seen once the movie ends.",1031529600,2,2126,4.6005291005291005
1729857,4,B000068TSI,"If you liked ""Black Hawk Down,"" you should like this movie. They are very similar in that they both tell the story of one battle. BHD re-creates the 1993 American siege of the Somalian warlord Aidid's stronghold city of Mogadishu, where a 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour urban war. In BHD, two Black Hawk helicopters were downed by rocket-propelled grenades. There, the U.S. soldiers, unwilling to leave anyone behind, were attacked from all sides by armed by supporters of Somali warlord Aidid. ""We Were Soldiers"" is the story of the United States first major battle with the North Vietnamese army. Similarly, WWS is little more than the story of one battle. It involves a contingent of 400 American soldiers from the American Air Cavelry on the bottom of a hill, who for several days fight off waves of several thousand NVA soldiers who were hidden atop the hill in an underground bunker complex. The film has only two parts which are not the battle. The first is in the beginning of the film, where we are introduced to Lt. Col Harold Moore and his family. We, the audience, are also informed Lt. Col. Moore is to implement new US tactics using helicopters as cavelry to ferry men and supplies in and out of battle. The other part, interspersed with battle scenes, has Lt. Moore's wife delivering telegrams to the wives of those soldiers killed in the battle. There is little more to this film.
On the positive side, the performances are very good. Mel Gibson makes the film worth seeing. He does an excellent job of making Moore interesting, portraying his religious beliefs, family values and ethical standards. The last are exemplified by his dedication to his troops by refusing to obey orders to leave the battle to debrief his superiors. The filmmakers do a very good job of making the viewer see the overwhelming odds facing the soldiers and their fear.
On the negative side, except for Gibson's portrayal of Lt. Col Harold Moore, none of the characters are given any depth. There is no sense of conflict between characters; the Vietnamese army charging down the hill is little more than an attacking horde of aliens in a computer game. A game of Space Invaders has almost as much plot. There is no sense that the American soldiers are there other than to see if they can survive wave after wave of faceless soldiers attempting to kill them. Perhaps this is the film's statement about America's purpose in Vietnam. I don't think so.",1031270400,,2450,4.767058823529411
1729858,4,B000068TSI,"Perhaps the contemporary war film is becoming a tired and near exhausted genre in its current form. After the watershed ""Saving Private Ryan"", there really may not be much new to say in a large scale war epic.
One might certainly gain this impression based upon the many negative reviews of both ""Ryan"" and this film. Those souls have attempted to brand these two films as cliched and retro-patriotically simplistic. Watching this film as well as listening to director/writer Randall Wallace's superb audio commentary, it becomes apparent that ""Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" can possibly be labeled as cliched because they are both honest and realistic.  We find an example of this in the dialouge uttered by the dying soldiers who often proclaim ""Tell my wife I love her."" Yes we have heard this time and time again, but that just happens to be frequently what soldiers say in their final moments. Unfortunately when we see the same truth shown too many times, it does become often cliched and redundant.
But what else does one want in an honest war film? Perhaps some folks deride this and ""Ryan"" in favor of the pretentious new agey pseudo Steinbeck-lite ramblings of Terrence Malick's beautifully photographed but muddled, cold and pompous piece of snobbish fluff that was ""The Thin Red Line"".
But I digress, ""We Were Soldiers"", missing becoming a classic because of its unfortunate timing in coming after ""Ryan"" still remains a very very good film.
I particulary appreciated Wallace's inclusion of footage that raises the humanity and the courage of the NVA regulars. These are not Hollywood stereotyped villians. These soldiers are equally as brave, pious and devoted as the American soldiers. Wallace achieves this balance without resorting to any political posturing. This becomes especially apparent in many scenes, including a remarkably touching quiet scene in which Gibson's (delivering a fine performance) Hal Moore aknowledges the fact that the enemy prays to Diety as well.
I also value this film's structure. ""We Were Soldiers"" shows the homefront as equally as the battlefield. It shows the pre war experience as well as the war and the post war time as well. Wallace, utilizing the real veterans of this battle, seeks to humanize the reality of the war. Again, some might find much of these sequences quaint and simplistic. But they remain true.
This film also avoids the cynical, nihilistic and ugly previous portaits of Vietnam soldiers that bombarded us in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. It seemed that the films of DePalma, Stone (except for his excellent ""Born On The Forth Of July""- which might be his most balanced film) sought to tear apart and demonize America through the Vietnam soldier. This film seeks again to give them some dignity and honor and finds it in their devotion to their fellow men (and honor of enemy!).
What makes ""We Were Soldiers"" a must own as opposed to a simply must see, is Paramount's (usually incredibly stingy in their packaging) inclusion of a great many extras. As stated earlier, Wallace's commentary is most illuminative. Many of the deleted scenes flesh out the emotional and intellectual impact of the film and are worth watching as well.
Give this film a try. It is definately a film that honors the veterans of the war. From both sides of the battlefield.",1031270400,3,3320,4.971223021582734
1729859,4,B000068TSI,"This movie was a decent remaking of the vietnam war. Mel Gibson was superb but Sam Eliot took the cake. He was awesome in his role. The movie itself was allegorically correct. It begins very structured, just like the military training, and then when the bullets and bombs start going off and all hell breaks loose, the movie becomes a convuluted miasma of cut scenes and confusion ---just like a war.  Greatness. The director of this movie hit it right on the mark.  I say it was a decent remaking of Vietnam only because my uncle, who was really there, says it was much different. Eh, who am I to know? I just think it was a good movie. WATCH THE OUTTAKES!",1031270400,,657,4.377049180327869
1729860,4,B000068TSI,"Most movies I've seen about the Vietnam War have been depressing. ""Platoon"" and ""Hamburger Hill"" come to mind, as they are there to remind us that Vietnam was a real shock to us back in the 60's and 70's. Yes, we remember we pulled out, lost if you want to say, but I don't go to a movie to get depressed. Randall Wallace's ""We Were Soldiers"" is not a depressing movie by any means, but shows that heroes were made in a war we look down on even today.
From the book ""We Were Soldiers...And Young"", the main character is Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a family man put in charge of, for the most part, green officers and men. The film also stars Sam Eliott, Chris Klein, Madeline Stowe, Keri Russell, and Berry Pepper. The majority of the movie takes place in Vietnam, where Moore and his 7th Cavalry fights 4000 NVA's while there are only 300 with Moore.
The battle scenes (which comprise the movie pretty much) are gory. Now, this isn't the goriest battle sequences you've ever seen, but it ranks number three in my book (""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" taking the other two) for realistic wounds and such. The battle is hot and exciting, featuring infantry, air force, artillery, the whole deal. Some of the most frightening scenes come at night, when we see how close the NVA's really get to the lines. Wallace effectively knows when to change scenes at different places of the battle, and the changing it to back home with the soldiers' wives.
Gibson of course performs admirably here. He plays Moore to detail as not only a father of seven, but a father of three hundred. Sam Eliott was casted brilliantly as the gruff Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper as the journalist who would write the book along with Moore, Klein as an upcoming platoon leader that meets his demise, and Russell and Stowe clean up at home. Once again a great ensemble cast, and a great film. A little lengthy, but this film makes it worthwhile. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a rather positive look on Vietnam, thankfully conveyed by Wallace and Gibson.
I knew that Wallace had written the flop ""Pearl Harbor"", but the last time that he and Gibson got together was ""Braveheart"", and we all know how successful that movie was. ""We Were Soldiers"" is no different, with intense battles, emotion, and the reminder that heroes can just be ordinary people.",1031184000,7,2324,4.5889423076923075

Salty. That is the correct word to describe such people. A look. Manner of speech. No BS!
Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt. Col. Moore raised my already high opinion of his acting ability. Some compare the performance to Braveheart ; this was better.

  Mel Gibson is phenomenal.  He never disappears in a character like Marlon Brando can, but somehow the characters he plays fit him perfectly.  Sam Elliot is also very good in this movie and reminded me of some of my staff non-commisioned officers in the Corps.
  One of the reasons that Hollywood and the press have and will continue to trivialize this movie is that it depicts triumphant American fighting men in a war that both of those institutions have made a career of painting as evil, embarassing and lost. Blackhawk Down recieved a similiar treatment.
  It is refreshing to see such a recent spate of movies that show the American fighting man in such a positive light.  Once again Mel Gibon proves that he does not make bad movies.  Look for him to become the Charlton Heston of this movie era.",1030838400,,1004,4.553072625698324

I'll admit that the movie is very entertaining but the movie borrows liberally from just about every war movie ever made, and what's stranger is that it is a true story.  There are many scenes in this that will have you rolling your eyes at how corny it is.  We have one soldier who is dying who says the classic ""tell my wife, I love her.""  What about predictability?  A guy says that his wife is having a baby and what happens?  He gets killed.  A woman receives a telegram from Western Union about her husband dying and what does she do?  She says the classic ""No, no, its not true, your lying, no, no!""  Think about all those old war movies from 30 years ago and you pretty much have this movie.  Another complaint is about the violence.  The violence doesn't bother me, but the way it is handled does.  How many more times in movies are we going to have the scene where your talking to a guy one minute and then all of a sudden a bullet smacks him in the head?  The violence is almost comical, the people who made it want to you to think ""how did they get that guys skin to fall off?""  Please, don't listen to the people who give this five stars, this movie will conjure up thoughts of certain story elements from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and every movie about war in the past 50 years.",1030752000,,1349,4.21875

In the early stages of this war, the Army itself was ready and willing to fight this fight.  This is not one of those earlier films, showing the later stages of the war where the Army was demoralized by the politicians and the poor leadership put in place by those inept politicians.  Mel Gibson gives another stunning performance of a true field grade officer, who was born to do what he was doing.  He again shows that when you want to make a film of epic proportions, he's the one you want in the leading role.  Along with the disheartening scenes of what happens to soldiers in a war, the scenes with the wifes at home receiving telegrams from a taxi were very painful and gut wrenching.  Being a soldier myself, I think it would be worst for my wife to get that kind of notification, than being the one killed.

But instead of the intricate details, superb script and acting of ""Saving Private Ryan"", we have here a childish plot and theatrical acting that made one feel amused rather than cry with the soldiers' families.  Can you imagine official US Army telegrams informing the deaths of the soldiers were left unattended outside the front door of the Colonel's house for his wife to pickup & distribute, at her convenience, to the devastated wives of the soldiers killed in action?  The wind might have blown some of them away and those poor wives will never know that their husband had been killed. This is the level of details and authenticity you might expect from this movie.
This movie appeared purposeless and did not adequately portray the heroism of the true soldiers. Probably because it seemed so faked?
Basically, you get plenty of action and loud explosions, but not much more. May be the fault were not the actors' or actresses', but the director's?",1030579200,,1115,4.802083333333333
1729878,5,B000068TSI,"Every scrap of film should be picked up from the floor and the dvd made into an extended edition. Enough stars given for the movie itself. There are already 186 reviews on this movie. The really good stuff is in the DELETED SCENES. Usually, deleted scenes contain seconds, but I was convinced that the primary cuts were in the DELETED SCENES.
There was this heart-renching scene in the church as the helicopters swooped in on a Sunday. A few minutes of this academy award standard material beats the daylights out of the first full hour of Pearl Harbor. How different the effects of depicting similar scenes on a lazy Sunday. The scene cuts poignantly to an ambulance-chopper. Rates at least five Kleenex tissue boxes.
I first wondered what Julia Roberts was doing in the movie on my first browse.  Then I realised that the producers saved $20 million bucks by casting the lovely and talented Madeline Stowe.
Then there was the Sergeant Sam Elliott doing the full monty. I thought the director wanted us to examine his battle-scars as substitutes for medals. About face to a full frontal of Sarge with a stack of medals around his naked chest, including two Medals of Honor.
The scene where a yet to be promoted Lt Colonel was being debriefed by General Westmoreland and the Secretary of State was absolutely PRICELESS. Shows the mismatch in the perception of the war by actual combatants and political leaders from day one.
I noticed the Eagles on Mel Gibson's shoulders when he came home, instead of the oak leaves throughout the movie.
He retired a Lt-General, not as a Light Colonel.
Watch the DELETED SCENES for yourself. Alone, they are worth the price of the dvd. I am sure there is much more in the vaults. Somehow WE WERE SOLDIERS II: the sequel would just dishonour the original, so lets get the extended edition ASAP, by yesterday.",1030492800,7,1842,4.738317757009346

1729882,4,B000068TSI,"War movies can go one of three ways, in my humble opinion:  overly wrought and maudlin; inaccurate and silly in presentation; or straightforward and personal.  ""We Were Soldiers"" presents the story of a group of men with Gibson at the helm as a a personal drama.  The ""difference"" this film has from ""Platoon,"" or ""Hamburger Hill"" is that it approaches its story from the man and not the soldier.  We learn about the minds and the souls of the men in the uniforms.  It has been attempted in other films about Vietnam, but I think this one really hits the nail on the head (or gets as close as any I've seen).
This is a gory film - but war isn't pretty.
This is an emotional film - war is emotional.
This is a frightening film.
There is certainly an element of positive slant with regard to the U.S. - but by God - this film is an American film and it should have such a slant.  It isn't a documentary.  However, Wallace does do a good job of presenting the Viet Cong as humans with feelings and emotions too.  While not perfectly balanced, it is very even handed on the whole.
As the viewer, you certainly empathize with the soldiers who do their duty and you admire the leadership and direction of their captain.  It is not hard to see why these men followed him into battle with respect and honor.

All Americans should see this movie and try to understand the message here, of which there are several incuding the futility and utter waste war is, from both sides.

THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT THE SAME QUALITY AS THE ""TOUR OF DUTY"" TV SERIES (FILMED IN HAWII WHICH ATLEAST LOOKS SIMILAR TO VIETNAM). I READ THE BOOK AND HAVE SOME MILITARY BACKGROUND (INFANTRY PARATROOPER 1987-94)AND IT STRUCK ME AS MOSTLY CORNEY DRAMA.
THE ACTING IS NOT GREAT. THE MOVIE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FILMED IN THE HILLS OF CALIFORNIA IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE TERRAIN OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF VIETNAM, THAT IN IT SELF IS DISTRACTING. IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAR WAS FOUGHT AT FT HUNTER LIGGETT CALIFORNIA. THE NVA SOLDIERS ARE ALL DRESSED IN KHAKI UNIFORMS (DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ACCURATE OR NOT MIGHT BE) WHICH LOOK AS IF THEY JUST CAME FROM THE DRY CLEANERS NOT THROUGH THE TUNNEL COMPLEX WHERE THE SOLDIERS WERE LIVING. THE SCRIPT IS VERY UNORIGIONAL, PERDICTABLE AND CORNEY.
THERE ARE SEVERAL SCENES WHERE AIRCRAFT (F-100 SUPER SABRES AND HUEY HELICOPTERS) ARE COMPUTER ANIMATED, UGH TERRIBLE!! M-16 MUZZLES TO THE FLOOR OF THE AIRCRAFT DURING AN AIRMOBILE OPERATION IS A NEW IDEA THE MODERN ARMY USES DURING PEACE TIME. WATCH ANY VIETNAM DOCUMENTARY OR NEWS REEL FOOTAGE AND SEE IF ANY HAVE THEIR MUZZLE POINTING AT THE FLOOR BOARD, THEY DON'T.
NAPALM EXPLOSIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIREY, RPG AND GRENADE EXPLOSIONS ARE NOT. I HATE TO SEE A VEHICLE GET HIT WITH AN RPG AND GO UP LIKE A GAS STATION. PEOPLE SHOT IN THE TORSO WITH RIFLE BULLETS DO NOT SPRAY BLOOD THROUGH THEIR CLOTHING THREE FEET AWAY.
THE AVERAGE CIVILIAN WHO HAS NEVER SEEN LIVE ORDINANCE DETONATE AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT INFANTRY TACTICS, WILL PROBABLY THINK THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. IF YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED. THIS IS NO SAVING PVT RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, OR PLATOON. WHAT THIS MOVIE REALLY NEEDED WAS A GOOD VIETNAM COMBAT VETERAN AS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR (GOD KNOW THERE ARE ENOUGH AROUND).

1729913,5,B000068TSI,"My husband and I just watched this movie tonight. It really struck home. I was young when we got married, very young. I was in love. He was seven years older than me and in the military at Ft. Benning, Ga when he had to go overseas for the second time to Vietnam. Before he got on orders I became pregnant. This was a hard time for me to have him go to a place where there was real fighting going on. This movie brought back the real life of not only the men who had to go over and fight this war but the wives who were behind caring for the children and trying to keep the candles burning for their loved ones to return. I give this movie more than a five stars. It deserves more than a ten plus rating and more than two thumbs up. This is the first real war movie that I have enjoyed watching. Mel Gibson and the other soldiers showed true sadness and strength. It was reflected and mirrored in their eyes and on their faces. I hope that it will get some kind of awards or more recognition for the hard work that was put into the making of this film. I could understand and feel what the women were going through. This movie is true to life. Everyone should see this movie and remember what our men went through. It is a movie that should be shared by others. The emotion and trepidation that was on these men faces will always remain as a memory in my heart. A class all in itself!!!",1030147200,6,1386,4.08058608058608
1729914,5,B000068TSI,"Firstly, this war movie is a little different from the rest which I have seen so far. It has a very good mixture of action as well as psychological effects of war, which is missing in most of the war movies like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down.
The movie did start with the actions (the French in Indo-China). However, later into the show, it concentrated on the effects of war, not only on the soldiers themselves, but on their loved ones and countrymen. I loved the part whereby Hal Moore's (Mel Gibson) wife dispatched the telegrams of the sacrificed solders to their family members. The effect has a tremendous impact on me, as I am also a reserved soldier in my country who needs to report to camp annually for training. I am acting as a solder, a father, a brother and a civilian at the same time, just like all of them in the show. This mixed feeling is not easy to describe if one is not in our shoes.
Secondly, the action part of the movie is not compromised as well. It is so action-packed during second part that my eyes stayed glued to the show for the entire 2 hours. The makeup for the soldiers was very realistic. Sound effects was incredible. Choppers and planes zooming pass, bullets swishing everywhere. Everything was projected crystal clear on my 5.1 surround sound speakers.
Lastly, I would urge war movie-goers to get it. Worth every cent of it, simply because it contains not only actions, but more importantly, the foolishness and cruelty of war, as well as the sufferings of everyone that is in it directly or indirectly.",1030147200,2,1554,4.553571428571429

This movie did an excellent job of portraying the war from all points of view, from the soldiers on both sides to the families at home who had to watch their loved ones go off into the unknown and unknowable.
In my opinion this movie did nothing to 'glorify' war as some critics claim, but did plenty to tell the story as truly as it could be told.  Buy it for yourself, buy it for your friends.",1030060800,,521,4.463157894736842

As a Vietnam veteran, I was moved by the extraordinary violence and horror our American boys had to endure in that early battle. There were many more horrific years that followed, but this one was especially shocking for the young men thrust into its ugly jaws without knowing just how bad it would be.
Powerful on the big screen and powerful on DVD in a home theater.

The accurate portrayal of the phosphorus grenades, the napalm, the medevacs and the senseless chaos of war seemed to eclipse time and mentally reinstate the ghastly images, putrid smells,  and brutal sounds that inhabit the recesses of a soldiers mind forever.
The accurate depiction of the various segments of war also displayed the camaraderie between soldiers; the teamwork and cohesiveness so necessary for survival.
This is a movie that will make the veteran remember.  However, it also has the comprehension and mastery to captivate and enchant those who have never been to war.  It spares no emotions and is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1030060800,,859,4.979020979020979

There are some who might subscribe to ""Platoon"", others who said that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was the most accurate. I think most agree that the book this movie is based on is an outstanding resource, but the movie can't possibly include all of the details. The movie is very entertaining and doesn't quite paint the story with such a wide red, white and blue paintbrush (as with the carefully slanted ""Black Hawk Down""). It is, as the documentary suggests, a story of the hatred of war, but the love of the soldier. This is a very good movie that draws appropriate attention to the American soldier, and I give it four stars for it's honesty and clarity.",1029974400,2,742,4.586466165413534

There is not one thing they ""got right"" with this movie.  When I see movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, I am reminded of what great filmmaking involving the Vietnam War can be.  For an author to outright say Hollywood has never produced one film about the Vietnam War with ultimate correctness, I am appalled by the accusation since those last three films I just mentioned have gone on to be some of the most powerful and gripping films of our time-not to mention of the Vietnam War!  After watching ""We were soldiers,"" the directors and writers use every cliche in the book (including cliches innovated from those three films) to tell a story that has been told a million times before and with far better innovation than this tripe of a film!
Let me say this without reservation;  I am in the US Navy and quite simply, watching something like this angers me because it tries too hard to convey a message without taking the really hard roads to tell it.  It's almost presented with too much ease and not enough grit and grime.  I will say, there is one scene where the grit and grime come really close-when Barry Peppers character tries to lift one of his buddies to safety only to accidently pull off charred legs from Nepalm-it's gripping and shocking and the look on Barry Peppers face is brilliant.  Barry Pepper is a really great actor and quite frankly he really holds up a really small and strong character throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I quickly ended up breaking in laughter watching bacon boy look ridiculous with all the obvious layers of make up that was supposed to look like a charred face.
After watching the ""making of"" documentary on the DVD, my assumptions were correct when they show you a plethora of wardrobe for Mr. Gibson who wore dozens of different uniforms to show the wear and tear of the event.  C'MON!  Why not just have Mel Gibson in one uniform for the entire thing?  Do you see what Hollywood is trying to do here folks?  It's not reality and it's not realistic, it's just a bunch of guys in front of a camera playing war games only with a bunch of caterers standing by and slick and expensive production designl. Even worse, no heartfelt emotion anywhere!
The DVD itself poses almost no extras (not even a trailer) and is a letdown considering this movie was a major upset and only raked in a measly 60 million at the box office.  This movie cost almost twice that and I don't see them really making up the cost anywhere on this DVD version.  I am kinda glad this movie didn't go too far.  It doesn't deserve to.  After watching brilliant war films like Saving Private Ryan (depicting WW2) and Black Hawk Down (Gulf War), you know that the story of Vietnam has been appropriately done somewhere else after watching ""We Were Soldiers.""",1029974400,21,2959,4.584440227703984

1729943,5,B000068TSI,We Were Soldiers is by far the best movie I've seen in some time.  Mel Gibson really showed his ability to command a movie dispite having a very good supporting cast.  I watched the movie three times and had only had two days.  Simply EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!,1029974400,3,254,4.6
1729944,5,B000068TSI,"This is another of the recent trend ( ""Blackhawk Down"", ""Behind Enemy Lines"") to make war movies based on true stories. Here, the war is in Vietnam, and as most know, it was a war that sharply divided the Country (in fact, the last ""fuss"" that I engaged in was in objection to a fellow that needed a bath & haircut who was cussing out a soldier in an airport). This film operates at several levels. First is the basic (if one can describe such courage and dedication under that rubric) story of LTC Hal Moore and his airmobile regiment in the Ia Drang Valley, called ""the valley of death"", in 1965. More important to ,me, at least, was the depiction of Moore as a commander DEEPLY committed to his men, as well as to his mission. There is also the aspect of a clear sense of failed support, both from Moore's superiors and from the Federal Government. Finally, there is a moving segment that shows the effects on the home front, as casualty telegrams are received by the soldiers' families. To tell more would spoil the unfolding story of this excellent film. It is a very realistic reinactment, and as such is an effective reminder as to what happens when we ask our young men and women to go in harm's way. Soldiers don't make policy or start wars; they follow orders and go where they are sent. It has been very gratifying to see the development of Mel Gibson as an actor since the ""Mad Max"" days, and his performance here is simply compelling. All of the cast perform well, but I make special note of Madeline Stowe's outstanding portrayal of LTC Moore's wife; she is a beautiful woman and an excellent actress; if you are not moved by her performance, you lack a heart. Also, the very talented Sam Elliott is perfect in the role of Moore's VERY tough Sargeant Major. Visually, the film is fantastic: the combat scenes are gut-wrenching, rivalling those in ""Blackhawk Down"". Sonically, the disc offers Dolby 5.1EX, so be prepared for complaints from the neighbors. I underscore the realism of the combat scenes. While such are always ""troubling"" to watch in the sense of the reality of war, if you, as a potential viewer, cannot handle such scenes, pass on. However, ""We Were Soldiers"" is an outstanding tribute to the brave men and women who followed orders in the Vietnam War, and, I suspect, to the men and women in uniform today. It's a great movie!",1029974400,10,2357,4.561320754716981
1729945,3,B000068TSI,"This is an excellent film. For me, I enjoyed watching how the commanders of both sides came to their decisions in the course of the battle. The scenes of the domestic front, both in America and in Vietnam, added to the pathos of the tragedy which resulted from this important battle. My points are largely for the film, and not for the supplements.
The DVD has three supplements - a commentary, a short film on the production of the film, and ten deleted scenes with commentary. The commentary can be repetitive. Mr. Wallace has three themes it would appear -  how magnificent his actors are, how true his movie is to the actual events, and the brilliant cinematography of his lead camera man. I found myself predicting his statements before he even uttered them.
The thing I missed most from this dvd is historical background into the Battle of Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The movie passes very quickly over the history of Vietnam after World War II, with a quick snapshot of the failed French campaign in the mid - 1950's to Washington ordering a massive mobilization of troops to the region in 1965. If this had been included I would have given the DVD a much higher rating.",1029888000,2,1174,4.59047619047619

This is such a powerful telling of the early days of Vienam. How true men of valor could and DID act under pressure.

1729949,4,B000068TSI,"I expected this to be a great movie and I must say I was slightly let down. I was expecting a Vietnam version of Braveheart in a way which I suppose was a tough standard to beat. The bad thing though was that I had seen this after two other war movies, 'Behind Enemy Lines' and 'Black Hawk Down'. 'Black Hawk Down' was in my opinion a better film and 'Behind Enemy Lines' was very different in that it went more for a summer popcorn type of war movie. Mel Gibson is, as always, terrific here and Sam Elliot does a great job as well. This is a different film than 'Black Hawk Down' was in that it showed the enemy's viewpoint as well as the view on the homefront. I thought that this worked to the film's advantage.
I must however say that this is a better war movie than the recent John Woo film 'Windtalkers' which was, after four war films, nothing new. Explosions get a little less exciting and the story falters after the chain of recent war films but nevertheless this is a film that I would recommend if the subject matter is of interest.",1029628800,,1044,4.251256281407035

honestly this movie is the closest I have ever got in truly comprehending what actually happended
in November 1965. The way that Randall Wallace has composed this movie is exceptional. Acting by
both Mel Gibson and the epigrammatic, yet, stunning appearance by Chris Klien is superb. Just
superb.
We sometimes tend to believe that war is just something ordinary. It just shows up at your
doorstep. All you have to do is just fight off the enemy. You win you lose. You die, you survive.
Actually its really not that simple. Its a very complex scenario, a scenario I have never ever
experiened in any motion picture. Well yes, might have in ""Saving private Ryan"", but not till
the extent, which was shown in this motion picture. The cameras were truly right where the action
was. Not too far and not too close, just perfect. Its like you're actually there. Its like youre
the one with the gun, the one who the enemy is after, the one who needs to survive.
The music is wonderfully composed. The timing is exact. I mean, in some of the previous
war movies, music just starts off without any rhime or reason. However, in this movie, it
just truly motivates you. At times, the movie touches you deep within. How people with families,
people with hopes, people with dreams just die in a war. And how both American and Vietnamese
soldiers died in November 1965. And most important of all, this movie is not only one sided,

In the book he sounds like he is a superheroe or something talking like he's some kind of great leader of men.  Give me a break!  He also contradicts himself in the book twice.

Mel Gibson did his best to try and save the film, but it ended up sinking faster than the Titanic. The films weakest point was the story of Gibson's wife, Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe;) it's where the film gets the most laughs, for me at least.

However, when the movie switches to show the families back home and their lives, it is capable of exceptionally emotional and very touching moments. The transition between such scenes is very well done. You don't find yourself watching an adrenaline-pumping scene and suddenly switch over to a scene of a sobbing wife. Instead, it naturally takes you through the peaks and lulls of emotion and you never find yourself being taken off-guard.
The end result is an excellent movie that has definite replay value. I plan on adding it to my personal collection.",1028073600,5,1072,4.928176795580111
1730010,5,B000068TSI,"We were soldiers is a harrowing story of an Army regiment surrounded by the N. Vietnam Army.  Not only were they surrounded, but there was more than 4 enemy soldiers for every American.  Based on a book (We were soldiers once...and young-by Col. Harold G. Moore, Joseph Galloway (Contributor)) the movie follows not only the battle but it touches into the family lives of the brave men.  The battle takes place in the La Drang valley at LZ X-ray (you may have heard of that one before if you are familiar with the Vietnam War).  They men had to not only fight to stay alive, but they needed to cope with their fear and they needed to keep it together. If you liked Black Hawk Down (the movie) then you would like this one and probably like it better because it tells you a little more about what was going on. Personally, I thought BHD was great, and this one was exceptional.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone.",1026518400,11,918,4.408284023668639
1730011,5,B000068TSI,If you are looking for a movie that is losely based on a true story this isn't it.  No added fictional story line and it doesn't need it. This is just about the one battle and about true heroism. Shows us what our service men and women go through for us despite the politics. Mel Gibson does it again.,1026259200,,301,4.101694915254237
1730012,4,B000068TSI,"The movie was a good, not perfect, portrayal of the events that occured in November 1965.  The movie fairly closely follows the book and for those viewers interested in getting the full story should get a copy of the book.  Anyone who does this will see that the battle really lasts over three days with a separate battle occuring the following two days.  The movie follows the book up to about the and of the second day.  Then the Hollywood licence takes over and changes the ending of the fight so that Col. Hal Moore, a battalion commander of the 7th Cavalry, looks larger than life.  Col. Moore ,who co-authored the book, was an outstanding officer and his actions and preparations that battle probably saved the lives of many of his soldiers so I was a bit disappointed to see that the film elaborated needlessly to make him appear almost superhuman.  This fact has been critized by other reviewers and I believe the blame lies on the writer and director and not on the acting abillities of Mel Gibson.  I will not spoil the ending for those who haven't yet seen the movie but I will say that the ending is a little more glorious than the actual end of fighting on the third day.  Sadly what happens on the 4th and 5th days isn't mentioned in the movie and for those who feel the movie ends on too much of an upbeat note for such a grim war, they should definately read the book.  It would be an interesting contrast for a film maker to produce a movie showing the second battle that involved the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Cavalry. This second battle was the ominous sign of things ahead for the U.S. Military in Vietnam.
All in all the movie shows a fairly accurate portrayal of the events and the thinking of the American military at the beginning of the Vietnam War.  Viewers should remember that this is before the attitudes changed at home and it became an unpopular war.  It is a good contrast from movies like Platoon which shows the war after the change has occured.  For those who have seen Platoon, the character Sgt. Elias, played by Willem Dafoe, is a veteran of the Ia Drang battles that are portrayed in this film.  It is definately a movie that should be seen by anyone interested in understanding what the American military experience was like in that turbulent era.",1026172800,13,2286,4.492753623188406
1730013,4,B000068TSI,"Due to the length of my review I've divided it to two : one discusses primarily the significance of this motion picture , the other one summarizes the plot extensively .
*At first , a warning - this movie is , in part , a terrible visual experience and one of the hardest I have ever seen . Prepare yourself .

Part one : Reasons to see/ significance .
-------------------------------------------
A question you might ask could be : ""why should I take my time to see another Vietnam War movie ?""
My answer would be : "" because I don't recall they have ever done such a movie about that war "" .
""We were Soldiers"" deals with the Vietnam War like no other movie I have seen . I suppose the distance of time and the proclivities of today's producers allow perspectives and purposes that were unpopular in the following decades after the war .
First and foremost , I agree with the director that the main purpose of the film is to heal the veterans . There were so many wounded casualties of the public's opinion that suffered just as much - and  more - after they returned home , than they had suffered throughout the Vietnam ordeal itself . We have read about it and seen it in numerous films . We have also seen many critic views about the war from Hollywood that apparently hurt the veterans as well .
It's time it's stopped .
The filmmakers say : ""Let others ask the questions about why they were where they were and why they did that they did , it does no good anymore , anyway"" .
The realization of the main goal is given form with a firm and harsh view at how one of the first real engagements of warfare looked like from the infantryman's eyes (see veterans reviews for confirmation). That done , without intending to judge the men who were sent by their country to serve . In other words , the film recognizes the tribulations the soldiers went through and the immense sacrifices they had to make . By doing so , it helps those men if just to feel a little better regarding their personal history and actions . In that it assists the healing process of the old wounds they carry deep inside .
In a way , I think it does well with the Vietcong's vets too . In here the enemy is given one of the fairest and balanced trials I've seen . More than ever we acknowledge and identify with his aims , missions , struggles and pain . Perhaps when coming from the American point of view it means something to them and makes them feel better too .
The movie also shows the angle of the wives back home , scenes that are familiar here in Israel , but are always important at showing how the lives of the close ones that are left behind continue , or more accurately stand still in the face of a war .
Part two : The plot and the cast .
--------------------------------
""We Were Soldiers"" is divided into two parts - the preface to the fight that is to come , and the battle itself .
The exposition presents most of the heroes of our story : Colonel Hal Moore (Gibson) , his wife Julie (Madeline Stowe ) , the sergeant major (Sam Elliot) and Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) to name a few . Here the movie concentrates mainly on Gibson and his family plus the forming and training of his battalion . The focal point is the fear of Gibson from the hell he knows he is going to face in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam . This part is rather bearable (tension wise) owning to number of scenes about the ideal family (Moore's) and the forming of campaign leaders , but at the same time uneasy knowing what is to come .
The body of the film is the incarnation of hell when Moore and his men set their feet on the Vietcong's turf . The shootings , bombing and body count begin immediately and are almost unbearable . I've never seen such concentrated sights of death , slaughter and destruction . In this region ""We were Soldiers"" sets a new record ; it's a long step forward in the presentation of war realism that easily surpasses the bloodiest sights of Gibson's ""BraveHeart"" and ""the Patriot"" together .
The stardom of Gibson is set-aside a bit in the wake of the ongoing battle , as different men and their actions for good or ill are highlighted . Gibson shines again in portraying the agony and pain his character suffers from ; this happens on account of the speeding number of the dead bodies of his men , while holding the leader-commander position and being in charge of everything . Throughout the movie this sense of personal lose and great responsibility is evident in Gibson's performance and in many ways it's a continuance of his stature appearances in previous films .
In the heat of the battle a young reporter (Barry Pepper) joins the film's staff and fighting men to cover the combat . For a while , he takes on a leading roll as the story concentrates in his experiences and reactions to the horrible trials surrounding him . To me , he represents the common viewer's reactions if dropped , at this point , into the fire : shocked , terrified and disbelieving he is witnessing such reality . In fulfilling that goal he is successful and does a great job .
Madeline Stowe is the leading actress at the U.S. , where the women are waiting in awe for news from the front . She delivers a commendable appearance portraying the wife of Hal Moore , who takes hold of the difficult duty of telling the bad news about the husbands to the family at the home base .
==============================================================
I've waited for a long time to see this movie , was shocked by the sights , and after I've digested its important aspects , I think I can see the importance and significance of this movie .
In the end , I hope I have helped you to see them too .",1026086400,24,5666,4.339302544769086

 Mel Gibson ~outstanding~, Greg Kinnear ~excellent~, Sam Elliott ~flawless~. I knew that I had seen the actor playing Sergeant Major Basil Plumley before but until I saw the credits I didn't realize it was Sam Elliott. I believe Sam might have a shot at a nomination or an award.
 Madeleine Stowe, Keri Russell, and the rest of the ladies did a great job of showing the results of war at home.

1730038,5,B000068TSI,"This is war and it truly is hell. Outnumbered on the field and backed by the politically driven Defense Department of the time, one battalion finds itself outnumbered and fighting for its life in the jungles of Vietnam.

A recent reviewer here mistook what this movie was about. It is NOT about America's war in Vietnam and all the ideology behind it. Its about a battle that occurred in the early years of that war between a new type of specialized fighting unit and a very determined enemy. America wanted to engage the enemy for the first time and this is the battle. The only politics involved here is the decision not to declare a National Emergency thus allowing the Army's most experienced soldiers to leave at the end of their enlistments, when ironically they were most needed. This movie is about a battalion commander training his unit, getting orders and shipping off to war. It also gives an excellent look at what the wives had to endure during that terrible time.

If one wants to look at the politics of this war, check out HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Path-to-War/dp/B00007M55W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Path to War</a>. Path to War shows the speech were LBJ sends this unit, the Air Cav, to Vietnam and the political reasoning behind it. It goes through LBJ's escalation and McNamera's change of heart on the winnablity of the war. Highly recommend it.

Anyway, in realism this ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan. By reading the book you get a much better grasp of what happened as well as the story not told of what happened at LZ Albany. That encounter was even a worse then what happened at LZ X-Ray.

All told this movie gives the feel of how horrible, horrowing and confusing first-hand combat can be. One decision can lead to winning the day, or as the movie shows, getting yourself cut off and most of your men killed. As for accuracy to what occurred, a group of soldiers that were there appeared on The History Channel's ""Hollywood vs History"" program and they concurred that it was 75-80% factual. 20 - 25% Hollywood. That's probably a good ratio indeed. Oh, and the little American Flag at the end was real, not Hollywood. And Sam Elliot deserves an Academy Award for his portrait of American Hero Sgt. Major Basil Plumley.",1024704000,216,2310,4.900255754475704
1730039,5,B000068TSI,"Finally a Viet Nam war movie that doesn't treat us like freaks. This is not an anti-war movie. It simply shows how it was from the infantryman's point of view. Any so called intellectual that tries to make it more, just doesn't get it. I saw it by myself the first time, the second time I took my twenty-seven year old son. He was shocked at what we went through. Buy it. Buy several copies.",1024617600,7,391,4.226666666666667
1730040,3,B000068TSI,"Based on a true story, ""We Were Soldiers"" recounts the first significant engagement between American and Vietnamese soldiers in 1965. In terms of realism and intensity, the battle scenes are truly state-of-the are and easily merit the same encomia as those in ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" From a human interest perspective, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the anguish of military families who must face the fear and reality of their loved ones dying in battle. And to the film maker's credit they make a significant effort to portray the Vietnamese enemy as good guys who were just doing their thing.
Oddly enough, the part of this movie I object to the most is the one that is frequently showcased in trailers and talk shows. In this scene, the protagonist, played by Mel Gibson, is asked by his daughter why people fight wars. He responds that war is what happens when bad men try to hurt other men and men like her daddy try to stop them. With these words, Mel Gibson not only provides his young daughter with an understandably innocent description of warfare in general, he also distills the entire theme of ""We Were Soldiers"" into a single sound byte. Mel Gibson is telling us that the Vietnamese were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys who were trying to stop them.
These lines disturb me when I consider the context in which this film was made. ""We Were Soldiers"" is following the newly blazed trail of neo-war movies that began with films like ""Saving Private Ryan"". This film and the World War II films that followed reversed three decades of objective, analytical war films such as ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", and ""Casualties of War"" and instead replaced them with a sentimental, jingoistic view of American military action. This was acceptable enough with ""World War II"" because there really isn't too much trouble distinguishing between right and wrong in that event. With ""We Were Soldiers"", however, Hollywood has now attempted to reshape the public's understanding of the Vietnam War along similarly benign and simplistic guidelines.
At this point, many readers are probably thinking, ""but this is a true story! How can you possibly state that it is misleading?"" This is a perfectly valid question to which I would respond first that this film is based on a book which is itself misleading in many ways, and second, it is the EXCLUSION of facts that makes this film misleading. ""We Were Soldiers"" presents American troops as benign interventionists in a conflict they new little about. In doing this it excludes some ugly realities about what American presence in Vietnam meant for millions of Vietnamese. To begin, with the U.S. Congress estimates that in the course of the war the United States killed approximately 1,350,000 civilians, by all accounts a highly conservative estimate. In addition, there are numerous well documented instances crimes perpetrated by the American military against Vietnamese civilians including rape, murder, theft, unlawful imprisonment, the destruction of farmland, torture, contamination, and forced prostitution.
While ""We Were Soldiers"" is wonderful for all the reasons that an action packed, loosely historical film should be,  it is also problematic. If after seeing this film, you do not want to do some research in the library or online, at least see some films that offer different perspectives of the war. I know that for many of our veterans, unjustly blamed for something that was largely the fault of American politicians this film must seem like a welcome relief. Our veterans do deserve to be acknowledged, and its high time the nation apologized to them for the blame it heaped upon them for doing their duty. But distorting America's role in Vietnam by focusing exclusively on the heroics does not do them a favor. It does the entire country a great disservice.",1024012800,,3889,4.992295839753467

1730042,4,B000068TSI,"As much of the Vietnam War becomes forgotten except as it is experienced through the movies about it, this movie is an important addition to the genre.
... The story told here is an honest one about brothers in arms who went where their country sent them and did what they were asked to do. The message is not dissimilar to that seen in many WWII movies but severely lacking in movies about this conflict which seem to find more ""truth"" in such movies as ""Platoon"". While that, too, is a great film, it must be remembered that the acts portrayed in it were the exception, rather than the rule.
""We Were Soldiers"" examines the first battles of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and a force of some 400 men defend a vulnerable position from attack by as many as 4,000 North Vietnamese entrenched in the surrounding mountains. The tactics, the motivations, the emotions and, ultimately, the terrible cost are examined through the eyes of Moore, his top Sergeant (played flawlessly by Sam Elliot), Moore's wife (Madeleine Stowe), an intrepid chopper pilot (Greg Kinnear) and a photojournalist (Barry Pepper).
The battle scenes are realistic - though not quite as harrowing as ""Black Hawk Down"" - and the characters are more clearly drawn than in that film.

1730044,4,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a realistic movie about Vietnam, from the standpoint of the battlefields and not the political realm.  Like his roles in The Patriot and Braveheart, Mel Gibson plays the part of a man with integrity who puts his life on the line to do his job well.  His integrity shows through his actions of keeping his promise to be the first to step on the battlefield and the last to step off and also to bring back every American soldier, be he dead or alive.
I say it doesn't delve into the political realm much because it just shows the soldiers (on both sides) as ordinary men with a job to do.  They are told to fight for their country, so they do.  If the politicians were doing their job right, then the soldiers either wouldn't be necessary or at least their suffering and dying would have been more meaningful.  Although once they came back home, the soldiers may have been subject to disrespect or even discrimination from anti-war protesters, they did what they felt it was their duty to do.
The main feeling this movie gave me was of the ultimate pointlessness of war, especially this war.  I'm no expert on politics or history, but this movie made me feel that the war was wrong.  I witness the bravery, heroicism, time, money, heartbreak, injury, and death that this war consumed and think how much better the world would have been if all this energy and resources had been used on something productive.  Managing to win a war is one thing, but managing to prevent the need of a war is something on a much higher level, something mankind has been unable to do throughout history.  This movie attempts to show men ""fighting for their country"" but it really makes me think that it's the opposite they did.  I think much of those men and women could have provided more for the country had they stayed ALIVE.  After all, fighting a losing battle on communism in a little country half way across the world doesn't sound like something patriotic to me.  Again, I'm no expert, and I don't mean any disrespect to Vietnam Vets, but this movie reinforces my opinion that Vietnam was a WASTE.  Men who gave their lives in it were manipulated and taken advantage of by the government.  One soldier discovered that he was going to be a father in a few months.  With this dillema, he goes to [Gibson], who replies that being a soldier helps him be a better father.  I find this contradictory.  Being dead, as this man soon would be in Vietnam, does not make one a better father.  One could make that statement about almost anything (and more truthfully), such as being a marathon runner, or a teacher, or a millionaire, makes one a better father.",1021939200,5,2656,4.532494758909853

1730088,5,B000068TSI,"As a two-time veteran of the War in Vietnam, and as a member of the First Cavalry Division during my second tour, ""We Were Soldiers"" reminded me of how it really was. I was fortunate, as a veteran, to view a pre-release showing.
This is a no-nonsense film. It does not represent the US Army as a bunch of pot-smoking baby-killers, but as SOLDIERS sent on a difficult mission by their country. Aside from the (first half of) ""Green Berets"", this is the only movie of the conflict which bears any resemblence to reality, and it represents it well.
While I was not involved in this particular action, I have participated in similar operations. As a helicopter pilot during the War, I could actually relive my sensations as the helicopters landed in LZ X-ray taking enemy fire. I could picture the casualties I picked up, and smell the burning flesh. I felt the anxiety of knowing what was facing my crew and I as we  made each trip to resupply units and pick up casualties on a ""hot"" landing zone.
As accurate as the military aspects were, so were the events on the home front regarding the human emotion and family side of the equation. The wives' ""chain of concern"" aspect of military life was typified when LTC Moore's wife intercepted the casualty telegrams from the taxi drivers to provide a dignified delivery of the bad news. This was, in fact, the situation when we started receiving heavy casualties before the Department of Defense was prepared to deal with it.
One must never lose sight of the fact that this is a true story, and that the authors of the book from which the film was made, General Moore and Joe Galloway, have made a contribution to history as much as any of the seminal works by Bernard Fall relating to Indochina. Anyone who tells me in the future that they got their impressions of Vietnam from ""Platoon"" or ""Apocolypse Now"" will sense my disgust as I tell them to leave their world of fantasy, and see ""We Were Soldiers"" if they want to know about the Vietnam War.
Mel Gibson, extraodinary as ever as LTC Moore, and director Randall Wallace have done an outstanding job in relating this story on film.
I suppose my bottom line is that I understand how a veteran of the Normandy Invasion must have felt during the opening invasion scenes at Omaha Beach in ""Saving Private Ryan"". It took a lot for me to regain my composure when the lights went on.

My one complaint about Black Hawk Down is that you never really get to know the soldiers so when calamity strikes you don't really get it. We Were Soldiers makes them real, and the inclusion of the experiences of those on the homefront is a great move. It's one thing when a soldier dies on the battlefield, a whole other when his wife receives word at home. I also give kudos to We Were Soldiers for realizing that the enemy on the other side (in this case the Viet Cong) weren't just a faceless monolith of asian menace but instead had families and lives back home they felt they were fighting for.

I am not a big fan of this genre, and was pretty much dragged into it by my husband.  I certainly don't feel that my time was wasted by any means.  It was very well done, and I thought some of the acting was just brilliant. Sam Elliot deserves the Oscar for his role!  He is great in this movie, and his character gets some of the best lines of the script.
Madeline Stowe, who I have never liked as an actress, plays Moore's wife.  Her and t.v.'s Felicity, Keri Russell, become fast friends being wives on base while the men are away at war.
It was just heart wrenching to watch them go to the homes of the women who had lost their Hero husbands to the elements of War.
It is so hard for me to review this movie, let alone recommend it. I think of going to the movies as an escape from real life. This is no escape. It is a slap in the face of the realities of the Vietnam War.  Although, this is a slap that leave a lifetime mark. Recommended to die hard fan of war movies, especially Vietnam.

This movie captures both the emotional side of the women left to worry about their men and the closeness of the men that went to fight.  Of particular interest was the studious leader (Mel Gibson) who researched everything before going in to battle.  Knowing the enemy and his traits, this is not something normallly portrayed in a movie about the Vietnam War.
And what an excellent movie that kept me (and my date) both glued to the end of our seats.  The action is both excitiing and depressing at the same time.  The true face of war.  An awesome reflection on the tragedy of it all.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look past the violence and senselessness of war, any war, but especially the Vietnam War (as far as senselessness).
Do yourself a favor, see this movie ASAP.",1020038400,,1007,4.445652173913044
1730094,4,B000068TSI,"Based on the book by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway, this film is about a 1964 battle of less than 400 U.S. soldiers against more than 2,000 North Vietnamese, which set the stage for the slaughters that were to follow. There's plenty of graphic violence using the most modern cinematographic effects and we are again reminded of the horror of war and the tragic human toll it takes.
Mel Gibson does a fine job as man who must lead his troops into battle.  Some of the scenes on the home front though are a bit too maudlin for my taste, as he plays a religious father of five, who must do his duty by protecting his loved ones at home. The army wives are just a little too sweet and brainless although a later scene in which Madeline Stowe, cast as Moore's wife, does show her to be a fine actress.  There is too much talk in the early scenes, too much of a sugar coated version of ""life in the 60s"".
But then the men go to Vietnam, and this is where the real story begins.  It is a story of heroism in spite of unbelievable odds.  It is the story of death and pain and wounds so graphic that I wanted to cover my eyes.  It is the story of the very beginnings of a war that later turned into a muddled mess.  The film made a small attempt to show some of the humanity of a North Vietnamese soldier but I suspect however that this was inserted merely for political correctness.  This story is indeed an American story that managed somehow to hate the war and yet honor the men who fought in it.
The action was intense, and with the exception of some of the early scenes, the story moved along well.  Mel Gibson and his supporting cast of actors did their jobs well.  I was moved and upset once again by the futility of war and thankful for the comfortable life I take so for granted.  We've all seen films like this before though and know the outcome.  It's not for everyone but I recommend it for war film buffs.  I enjoyed it.",1020038400,8,1937,4.205405405405405
1730095,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is based on the events of a 3 day spell behind enemy lines in North Vietnam in Nov 1965.  It details the actual accounts of battle from the viewpoint of the man who led the 7th Airborne Cavalry and the man who saw them in action.  Lt. Col 'Hal' Moore formed a new division, trained to enter hostile territory and ""find and kill the enemy.""  Their mission in November 1965 was to do just that, but against a force of unknown strength. He led his troops into battle, led them during the battle and fortunatley led what remained alive afterwards home to the USA after a complete tour-of-duty.  This film showed a battlefield as a cruel and violent place, men dying on either side, yet risking all to protect their comrades, the ethos of the 7th. It showed the brass-tacks of warfare too, re-supply by heroic chopper pilots in one scene, and the wives at home keeping themselves occupied to stop thinking of their men dying thousands of miles away - then the telegrams started arriving. A great movie in the finest traditions of such as ""The Green Berets"" or ""The Longest Day"" I loved every minute of it.",1019779200,4,1119,4.524752475247524
1730096,4,B000068TSI,"Mel Gibson has been type-casted as the leading hero for movies such as ""Braveheart"" (which he directed, produced, acted), ""The Patriot"" & for ""We Were Soldiers"", he snugged in the role comfortably.  For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned ""Braveheart"".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, ""We Were Soldiers"" was able to shine whereas ""Pearl Harbour"" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.  In the end, when we were shown the Memorial at Washington by Maya Lin then, we would start to appreciate the poignancy but continuing legacy of America's foreign policy.  Highly recommended but not for the faint-hearted.  It's good to see Madeline Stowe back to the silver screen again, & the leading lady from TV series, Felicity acting in a feature movie, & what a display of talent from Nina from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, & other supporting cast were simply splendid",1019692800,4,1989,4.919161676646707

Those movie gives a new look at the start of the war, the feelings of the soldiers and their families, and a suprisingly human look at the enemy. Along with the usual host of action and surprises, you begin to care deeply for the people in the movie.

When he took me to go see We Were Soldiers, his first comments was on the terrain.  He said it looked as though it was filmed in California.  But that was the only fault we found.  The combat sequences were excellent and truely realistic, you really had to make sure you own Hueys and planes did NOT shoot at you instead of the enemy.
The helicopter crash was the most realistic one I've seen yet in a war movie where when they crash they don't erupt in a ball of flame but the emmit severl bursts or sparks and the props spin off, the Hueys don't just explode and this was something which the producers worked really hard on and we could tell.
And the NVA and the Viet Cong really did send their troops out as if they were nothing more then dust.  The mentality was there would always be more troops and that was another really good point the movie made.  All in all, a great movie!",1018483200,3,988,4.173684210526316

1730135,5,B000068TSI,"'We Were Soldiers' is one of the most moving and meaningful war films ever made.  Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people.  You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them.  Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home.  Many films try to do this, not many succeed.  Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families.  While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.
Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore.  Gibson masters this role.  We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming.  He became Moore, right down to the way he walked!  Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore.  I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.
The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting.  I've never seen anything like it.  I must mention one particularly haunting scene;
The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them.  Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy?  ""I can smell them, they're here"" proclaims one.  They can't see anything.  It's pitch black.  The soldiers can barely breath.  One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at.  The flare come, the woods light up.  The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear.  They are only inches from where they lay.
This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'.  It took my breath away.
'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film!  I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling.  I wasn't the only one, either.  Grown men were crying as well.  We cried for the lost lives and the pain.  We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made.  This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it.  I honor them.",1017705600,16,2386,4.720873786407767
1730136,5,B000068TSI,"Although ""The Deerhunter"" will always hold a special place in my heart, I must say that ""We Were Soldiers"" is the finest film on the Vietnam War to date. How reassuring to see humane portrayals of men in arms--of men who make a career of service and devotion to country, whether American or Vietnamese. If, like me, you've grown weary and wary of war films that depict officers as inept or gung ho, soldiers as bewildered, misled, and demented, you will enjoy this film. As one whose father served in that war twice, it touches a cord. This is also the first film to show how the families must cope with daddies in combat. The scene between the Gibson character and his youngest daughter is poignant and reminiscent of Stewart talking to his sick daughter in ""It's A Wonderful Life."" No Hollywood glitz and distortion here. Neither is there too much lecturing and political statement making as you see in the Stone and Kubrick films. Even the drill instructor is believable in his role. The focus, to be sure, is on the officers of these men. The film is not without moments of humor but the pathos pervades it. The scenes of Gibson reviewing history books on the French fiasco in Nam in the 1950's and Custer's Last Stand are eerie and instructive. THIS IS THE ONLY 'NAM FILM that shows the actions of a single military offensive from start to finish. Gibson is superb in this role despite what others have said. He is visceral but also contemplative--a delicate balance worthy of academy award consideration. This film will get overlooked by the academy because it is too thoughtful for a war film but don't let yourself be deprived of its endearment and lessons, and stirring but not exaggerated portrayals. These are real men thrust into unreal circumstances. Although the Vietnamese perspective is brief and appears a token gesture of concern, the commander of their forces is a good counterbalance to Gibson's--he, too, is well-reasoned, not demonic. The scenes of the housewives awaiting news from Nam are also unforgettable. Two arms up!",1017705600,21,2045,4.8125
1730177,5,B000068TSI,"Vietnam Veterans can finally say ""They got it right this time"".  We Were Soldiers is based on a true story and does a great job of telling that story in part.  Although the film is mostly about a three day battle that the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry fought in the Ia Drang Valley and does not bring to light the complete battle which was fought by almost the entire 1st Cavalry Division, it does capture that battle realistically.  The truth is that we were not the drug abusing, baby killers portrayed in other war films about Vietnam and our enemies were not a bunch of rag-tag pajama wearing idiots with guns.",1017619200,9,611,4.486486486486487
1730178,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is the best war film to come out in a long, long time.  It's non-fiction without patriotic propoganda or nostalgic, or preachiness, like 'Pearl Harbor,' and 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Despite the comments of some reviewers, this movie wasn't promoting patriotism.  It was a highly technical portrayal of modern battle, and the concequences of sending your troops into battle.  If anything, the movie was somewhat of a tragedy, because despite the altruism of Lt. Col Hal Moore and his men, their actions would ultimately be in vain.

The movie was a refreshing 'Nam film because it focused on the war at its very outset, when the troops being sent there didn't think of the war we do now.  At the time, it was just another American war in which we'll go, fight for our country, and come out victorious, like always.  But even in this movie, you can see where politics and institutionalized stupidity were creeping into the Army.  Just look for the scene, when Moore is desperately needed on the ground to, A: Conduct the battle, B: Matintain the morale, trust and confidence of his men, and C: for moral reasons, his commander tries to recall him to Saigon so Gen. Westmoreland can have a 'briefing.'  WTF?  It's a credit to Moore's character and leadership qualities that he told the brass to go screw themselves.  Doing so meant he put the lives of his men above his own, and above his own career.

As a military vet, I knew a lot of officers who would have jumped at the chance to get out of that hell hole.  Fortunately, I knew an equal amount who would have said, ""You want a briefing?  Fly down here and we'll 'brief' you!""  The latter types were the only ones who instilled loyalty in their men.  The fish rots from the head.  If you have a bunch of great guys with a lousy leader, you're going to have a lousy unit, no matter what.  But even if you have a bunch of jerks with a great leader, you can have a great unit.  Moore's presence on the battlefield was probably essential to their victory.  When troops are patted on the back by their CO, it's a huge boost in confidence and morale.  When the CO is never around, or even worse, is gone, the rumor mill starts flying, troops feel like 'they' (the officers) aren't trustworthy, and that the soldiers are fighting for the wrong reasons.  Moore was the type of commander who would never let his troops think about the battalion terms of 'us' (enlisted) and 'them' (officers).  Moore's troops thought of the battalion as 'us.'

I saw a couple discrepencies in the film at first glance.  1 - a soldier getting on the bus in Georgia with a magazine in his rifle.  No way.  2 - I'm 95% sure they had metal canteens in 65, but they had plastic ones in the movie.

Also, I'm not sure why the soldiers didn't dig in on the perimeter.  They maintained a perimeter for a long time, overnight even, and in my training we would always dig, dig, dig anytime you stop and hold turf.

I liked how the Vietnamese were portrayed.  Despite having no air support and no artillery they fought as well as they could, and tried to 'hug the belt' of the Americans.  This lead the Americans to call in air support on themselves, leading to casualties.  It was good when they showed how scared the Vietnamese were, because in most movies they're portrayed as being somehow ghost-like, inhuman, when in fact they were damn scared, just like our guys.  Going against American firepower, not to mention guys who are physically up to twice your weight and on average six inches taller, took a lot of nerve.

Overall a great film.  It showed the US Military in its 60s prime, the tragic consequnces of using military force, and it also showed the home front, and how military wives are actually part of the battles we fight.  I highly recommend this to anyone.

1730179,5,B000068TSI,"We Were Soldiers is the war film I enjoyed the most since Saving Private Ryan (Well, ok, I haven't seen Black Hawk Down yet... my Uncle told me it's good... I'll check it out later).  Unlike the horrible, stupid Ben Affleck Pearl Harbor [movie], We Were Soldiers is watchable, moving, and mostly very accurate about the war (maybe 80% true & 20% fiction).  I almost cried during the film...
The typical Hollywood ""We American nice, you enemy bad"" black and white boring nonsense is toned down in this movie. (Some movie direcotrs just don't understand that the main characters are only great if the enemy is a worthy opponent)  Of course we still identify with Lt. Col. Moore & American side, but the film sort of give you an idea of what it's like for the other side.
Mel Gibson is a good actor as always, this one reminds me of his Braveheart performance (In case you have been living under a rock, Braveheart is also a good flick, if not historically accurate).  The story of We Were Soldiers starts out a bit slow, but in the process you get to understand the character more, not a bad trade off.
The war scene is a bit confusing, but that's how the war is supposed to be anyways.  I think the director does the good job conveying what's happening thru Lt. Col. Moore & enemy General's commands & tactics.  You could kind of understand what's going on  even if you are not a military fan (Heck, if my ""I-like-Britney-Spear"" friend could grasp most part, you should be able to, too.  And NO, I didn't have anyone else to go with at the time).

1730182,4,B000068TSI,"were created when the partnership of Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace brought General Harold Moore's, ""We Were Soldiers Once, and Young"" to the screen. Seeking to portray the vast majority of American soldiers, those who believed wholeheartedly in the early days of the conflict (1965), Moore's viewpoint is in contrast to so many other Nam movies which portray the soldiers' despair after staying ""in country"" for months, and falling prey to the brutality, drugs and hopelessness of their surroundings.
Moore & Wallace convey one of the best portraits of military wives ever brought to the screen, and perhaps focus on the women affected by Nam more than any film since Jane Fonda was featured in ""Coming Home"".
I think there may have been better choices to portray Moore than Gibson. He is larger than life in battle, but, for some reason, awkward in portraying his premonitions and uncharacteristically wooden as a father. Gibson, however, will draw audiences to the film, and thus, the reception the film gets will be widespread - and it needs to be seen.
Settings and music are brilliant, and the battle scenes, although perhaps too graphic, are vivid and realistic. Of particular note for their intensity are the shots of the North Vietnamese soldiers, silently approaching the American bunkers in incredible numbers, when the GI's call for ""illumination"". It is clear how the superior air cover of the US succeeded in allowing an outnumbered and outflanked force to defeat a much larger and entrenched enemy in this battle. The shots of chopper after chopper departing with the dead and wounded, and the appalling odds that the field medics were up against will leave you in sorrow. The North Vietnamese commander, however, expresses himself with a great premonition ""... it is too bad the Americans have won the battle, for the outcome is destined, and the results of this battle will just make the outcome stretch out in a longer and more bloody fashion""....and it came to pass.
Supporting players are adequate - Greg Kinnear shines in his role as a chopper pilot, Keri Russell is surprisingly believable as the wife of a young soldier, although the soldier, played by Chris Klein, is wooden in his role. Barry Pepper is outstanding as reporter Joseph Galloway, a noncombatant on the front lines who finds himself having to defend in the battle. I am usually a fan of Sam Elliott, but he is a little too much of a caricature in this picture. Lastly, the beautiful role given to the once-luminous Madeleine Stowe is wasted. Although she is enough of an actress to have played this well at one time, it would seem that someone who is more of a leader of women should have been cast (Maura Tierney, Mary Steenburgen?). Frankly, Stowe has apparently allowed herself to be the victim of a very bad collagen procedure on her lips, and the destruction this has played on her once beautiful face allows the viewer to focus on only this and wonder ---""What was she thinking?""
The finale of the film is touching, and does a good job wrapping up what is certainly the first important film of 2002.

1730215,4,B000068TSI,"There's no doubt that this is a powerful film, but there are some noticeable flaws. First off, the beginning scenes don't mesh together well. They seem contrived, not natural. However,the film flows more nicely once the guys get to Nam. Another problem with the film is that Wallace decides to portray the side of the enemy. This worked fairly well in Pearl Harbor, cause it led to the suspense of the coming attack. But here it seems as if Wallace is haphazardly trying to cause sympathy for the enemy. We know when the enemy will attack, so we are prepared when it comes. Wallace should've left the part concerning the enemy out all together, except for a touching scene at the end. Lastly, although I admire Mel Gibson as an actor he seems out of his element here. It is mostly because of dialogue, his one-liners make him seem more like a politician than a military man. Those circumstances aside, this is an enjoyable movie. There are some heartbreaking scenes (I give the film credit for addressing the ""war at home"" front.) And I must say it's refreshing to see a Vietnam film that doesn't portay the solidiers as either brutal mercenaries or strung out dope addicts. Futhermore, Barry Pepper gives the most outstanding acting in the film. This film won't win any awards, but it is well worth your time.",1016668800,3,1310,4.675324675324675
1730216,5,B000068TSI,"Being a young adult born in the year 1980, I never had a true understanding of the Vietnam war. I didn't understand the full mind-set of the era, even though I've read several books on the events that took place during the war. This movie, and this movie alone explained it to me. And in truth it's one of those movies that I wish I hadn't seen.
For an epic war story this movie had all of the aspects that make a movie great. It had outstanding cinematography that parallels both ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down."" The choices made for the music to this movie only add to the atmosphere of the battlegrounds. And the opening sequence that ends with the audience staring down the barrel of a gun, creates an absolutely disturbing feeling. But this movie also includes a wonderful story behind the soldiers, that a lot of movies tend to forget about. The wives that had to survive the war finally got their just amount of screen time.(and not the terribly stupid love story time that ""Pearl Harbor"" spawned) The novel ""Black Hawk Down"" did an excellent job of showing both sides of the conflict, that Ridley Scott seemed to lose in the making of the movie. This time, director Randall Wallace didn't make the same mistake and that made for a much better movie.
The acting in this movie was superb. Mel Gibson did a great job as usual, continuing his quest to fight in every war that ever took place. Barry Pepper filled his role as reporter Joe Calloway nicely. Sam Elliot had by far the strongest characters in the movie, Sergeant Major Plumley, and I can't see anyone else in his role. Even Chris Klein, of ""American Pie"" fame, could pass for an actor in this movie.
What seals this movie as a great in my mind, was the closing minutes of the film. Some movies sadden me, but I can handle soldiers being killed and widows crying, without really blinking an eye. But this movie really got to me. The North Vietnamese general's lines at the close of the movie, sum up the despair that was to come. And I finally understood what the war did to this country. And for the first time in a long time, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes.
The Breakdown:
1.  Plot- 9 (Great choice for a true life war topic)
2.  Characters- 10 (Nicely chosen characters to focus on out of the hundreds who fought the battle)
3.  Flow- 9 (Spent an adequate time on the background story and the action scenes went by quickly)
4.  Atmosphere- 10 (Battle grounds were realistic and excellent choices for music)
5.  Cinematography- 10 (Beautifully shot and realistic special effects)
6.  Entertainment factor- 10 (the time flew by)
7.  Replay factor- 8 (solid movie, but some will be bothered to much to watch a second time)
8.  Casting/character depth- 9 (everyone deserved to be in this movie and Sam Elliot was awesome)
9.  Relevance to genre- 9 (Great war movie that had very emotional aspects)
10. X-factors- 10 (Vietnamese general's speech to close the film along with the scenery will be in my head for a long time)

1730217,5,B000068TSI,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself ""Oh, no, not another Platoon"". But when I saw that Mel Gibson had a lead role in it, I changed my thought to, ""Well it might be alright."" About 2 weeks after it was released, my father, a Vietnam veteran, and I went to see the movie.
  The story, which was based on a true story, was excellent and the actors played their roles exceptionaly well. Mel Gibson portrayed the Lt. Col. so well, that I almost saluted him, everytime the character came on screen. The actresses who played the wives of the officers were excellent. The way they expressed the emotions really got to my heart.
  The movie is very violent, but war is violent. The special effects were especially great. One part in the movie goes as follow:
  It was at night and the sky was pitch black. The US and NVA had a brief cease fire. One Army Sgt. told his officer that he could smell them creeping up on the US soldiers. The officer requested illumination at their location. A few seconds later, lights came decending and the viewer could see the NVA sneaking up on the US soldiers. Whe the cavalry unit saw the NVA, they opened fire, and a brief fire fight ensued.
  The movie is full of action and emotion. Near the end of the movie, one part of the movie really got to me. In an airport, one soldier was wheeling another soldier on a wheelchair through the hallway. A mother with her children saw the two men and she pulled her children away.
  After this movie, I've placed it in my mind to say thankyou to all the Veterans, especially those who fought in Vietnam.
  Thankyou!!!",1016409600,3,1614,4.379194630872483
1730218,4,B000068TSI,"Sometimes I scratch my head and wonder what the people in hollywood are thinking when they release film after film after film about war, death and destruction in such a short period of time (Black Hawk Down, Harrison's Flowers, Hart's War, Behind Enemy Lines).  No matter how good or well-intentioned a film is made, it's hard to keep from thinking that it's just another war flick. It's hard to not think of it as cliche and redundant.
Some say this film is similar to Blackhawk Down.  In a way, it is.  In other ways, it's unique.  We Were Soldiers involves the family aspect of going to war.  It recognizes the sacrifices that not only the soldiers themselves make when they go fight a war, but also the pain and suffering their wives and children undergo with the absense and loss of them.  This film pays tribute to the soldiers (who were strongly outnumbered and out-experienced) who died fighting a 3 day war in Vietnam .
We Were Soldiers describes the war from two points of view.  From the American's and the Vietnamese.  We see the story give the audience a glimpse of what a good strategy can do even when the odds are against you.  We see a story of courage and leadership.
Think of this film as an exciting documentary to an event in American history.

1730219,4,B000068TSI,"Many war-movies have graced the screen but none have managed to convey the universal losses like We Were Soldiers in heartfelt sincerity. The movie adapted from a memoir by Moore tells of the Landing Zone-X Operation spearheaded by First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry in Ia Drang valley where Moore with his 400 men was ambushed by the overpowering 2000 Vietnam conscripts and regulars.
It is not a hard-hitting documentary of American military operations gone haywired like Black Hawk Down and neither is it a movie that decries war with embittered cynicism like Born on the Fourth Of July or Platoon. It aims to salute the bravery and courage of the soldiers for their altruism in Vietnam War in an old-fashioned style like that Of Green Beret in 1968 but of a different theme.
As such We Were Soldiers are bound to be sentimental where amidst the political backstage there are the wives at the Fort Benning, Georgia including Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell offering solace to each other when their husbands are mired in the holocaust. Their roles are unfortunately stifled.
It is where in the battlefield that the men are given enough screen time to impress. Moore performed by the dignified Mel Gibson is humanized by his sensitive portryal; Sam Elliot as the gruff sgt. major Plumley; Greg Kinnear as the over-confident pilot Crandall and Chris Klein as the ill-fated Geoghegan, Barry Pepper as the journalist who survived to tell the tale. Mel Gibson teamed with Randall Wallace who scripted Braveheart compensates his sentimentality with realisitic portrayal of bloodshed and is ghoulishly haunting when it films the piling corpses, sweltering bullets and imminent deaths mainly capturing the downfall of American soldiers in their tragic end.
We WERE SOLDIERS luckily casted away the stereotype as committed by Saving Private Ryan to acknowledge the grief and devastation to both parties. It is at its best a respectful tribute and one war-movie that examines the afflictions of war to Vietnam and American in enlightening honesty.",1016323200,2,2044,5.122754491017964
1730220,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldies"" should be required viewing in every American history class that addresses the era since WWII and Korea.  High school and college level students must view the film to be exposed to the reality and horror of Viet Nam, and, if nothing else, to view and hear Lt. Col. Moore's (Gibson's) last commentary on why these brave men fought so gallantly.  This is the best movie I have seen about the Viet Nam War.  I fought it from First Presbyterian Church, Killen, TX, adjacent to Fort Hood, TX, where I was Pastor, 1966-1972.  The movie brought back the horror of burying more Nam war dead than I want to remember.  Some of them were 7th Cavalry.  This move superbly depicts the task those of us on the home front had in helping families deal with those damn telegrams and all the arrangments that had to be made, and the pain endured - finally overcome but never forgotten.  Thank you, Mel Gibson, for making this movie!",1016236800,3,931,4.538922155688622
1730221,3,B000068TSI,"World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation ""the last good war.""  What this means is that the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.
This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans came to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures.  Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.
The new film, ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong - in November 1965 - one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word ""heroism.""  This is what separates ""We Were Soldiers"" from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In ""We Were Soldiers,"" no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.
Given this self-imposed myopia, ""We Were Soldiers,"" nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.
Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the ""death telegrams"" to the other wives on the base.
Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.
Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.
""We Were Soldiers,"" for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.",1016236800,3,5756,4.755020080321285
1730222,1,B000068TSI,"The movie did not develop any characters beyond the normal sappy sterotypes of soldiers.  The first half is a romanticized view of soldiers (and their families) lives.

The film is fairly close to the Moore/Galloway book. This is the first time that I remember an honest portrayal of both sides.

1730224,4,B000068TSI,"As much of the Vietnam War becomes forgotten except as it is experienced through the movies about it, this movie is an important addition to the genre.
... The story told here is an honest one about brothers in arms who went where their country sent them and did what they were asked to do. The message is not dissimilar to that seen in many WWII movies but severely lacking in movies about this conflict which seem to find more ""truth"" in such movies as ""Platoon"".  While that, too, is a great film, it must be remembered that the acts portrayed in it were the exception, rather than the rule.
""We Were Soldiers"" examines the first battles of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and a force of some 400 men defend a vulnerable position from attack by as many as 4,000 North Vietnamese entrenched in the surrounding mountains. The tactics, the motivations, the emotions and, ultimately, the terrible cost are examined through the eyes of Moore, his top Sergeant (played flawlessly by Sam Elliot), Moore's wife (Madeleine Stowe), an intrepid chopper pilot (Greg Kinnear) and a photojournalist (Barry Pepper).
The battle scenes are realistic - though not quite as harrowing as ""Black Hawk Down"" - and the characters are more clearly drawn than in that film.
Overall, this is an excellent look at true heroism and moral conviction in the face of adversity and almost overwhelming odds.",1016150400,8,1403,4.773662551440329

1730236,2,B000068TSI,"I read the book by Hal Moore prior to seeing the movie.  In fact I read the book several times as I found it one of the best non-fiction accounts of war I have ever encountered.  This was an important work for the battles in the Ia Drang played a pivotal role in the formation of American military strategy through the '60s (not that anybody in upper command appeared to either understand or heed these lessons).
So how did the movie compare to the book, i.e. the truth?  Not terribly well in my opinion particularly in regards the battle.  There was no 'charge' led by Hal Moore routing the NVA on the last day of the battle.  Pure 'John Wayne' style fantasy that simply did not play very well.  In truth this Hollywood 'addition' was completely unnecessary as there were plenty of 'real' heroes without any vainglorious nonsense.  Every man who served during in that battle was in truth a 'hero'.
The strong part of the movie?  The depiction of the families who lost husbands, brothers and sons.  The emotional carnage was a true reflection on the cost of empire that all of us need to understand, particularly in these grim times.  The 'view' from the NVA side was interesting and added a dimension to the film that usually isn't present.
I'm glad that a motion picture was made from Hal Moore's book.  General Moore was by all accounts a tremendous soldier and a man of true character.  I encourage people who enjoyed the movie to take the time to read the book by General Moore, ""We were soldiers once, and young"".

1730239,5,B000068TSI,"The title of the memoir that inspired this film, ""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,"" written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  ""We Were Soldiers,"" adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.
 It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.  The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things:  That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.
 With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Black Hawk Down""-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas ""Black Hawk Down"" put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it.
 The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the ""whole story,"" that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.
 Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.
 Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.
 The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed ""Too Tall"" Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like ""We Were Soldiers,"" is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.",1015891200,113,5714,4.707121364092277
1730240,5,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a phenominal film, easily the best war film since ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and definitely the best movie about the Vietnam war movie ever made.  This film celebrates the actions and the sacrifices of American soldiers in the Ia Drang valley, the trials of their families at home, and the perspective of the VC soldiers and their leaders.
The first 30-45 minutes firmly establishes the soldiers in the film as regular people, it wonderfully shows their faith, their doubts about their abilities as leaders, and their struggles as husbands and fathers, but still men who deeply care about their families.  One of the most memorable scenes from the film was when Moore's daughter asks him what a war is and his response to her question as he tucks her into bed.
Of course, the battle is the primary focus of the movie and the pace really gets going with the landing of the first helecopters.  The battle is a violent, realistic view of the events in the Ia Drang valley, on par with the battle scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan.""
This movie really strains the emotions, we watch men that we've come to know killed while trying to save their friends, and in a scene that really brought tears to my eyes, we see the yellow cabs delivering the government telegrams informing wives that their husbands are dead.
The film is respectful to almost everyone involved, American soldiers, Vietnamese soldiers, and the families of both groups.  The only people put in a disapproving light are some of the leaders involved in making deployment decisions, and the American press corps that comes running onto the battle field after the action is over.
I highly recomend this movie in every respect, it paints a very realistic, very human face on the first meeting between American and Vietnamese forces. (I actually liked this movie even more than Saving Private Ryan)",1015891200,4,1869,4.83125
1730241,3,B000068TSI,"Back  in 1992, when they brought out We Were Soldiers Once, and Young, Hal Moore and his collaborator Joe Galloway said, ""Hollywood got it wrong every ...time."" As it now appears on film, Moore's story , portrayed as We Were Soldiers, (director Randall Wallace) is a story that is appropriate for our present time, when we want to celebrate our heroes, but unfortunately, got it wrong.
 Hal Moore proclaims We Were Soldiers the best Viet Nam film. I disagree. For beginners, compare Mel Gibson's interpretation of Moore as a blood and guts WWII commander, with Robert Duvall's surrealistic Colonel Kilgore, another Air Cavalry Battalion Commander, from Apocalypse Now and ask yourself which one does a better job of telling the American public what Viet Nam was all about.
  We Were Soldiers does justifiably honor the young men who fought in Viet Nam, but the battle portrayed in the film was not typical of the Viet Nam combat that countless thousands of soldiers had to deal with. The battle for the Ia Drang Valley, November 14-17, 1965, was fought early in the war, when military discipline was still high, and it was possible to be a good soldier in Viet Nam, a stand up confrontation between two big units of the US Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, fought in the wilderness of South Vietnam's Central Highlands, away from population centers. Change the date and mise en scene and this film could have been in Korea, North Africa, the Pacific or Europe in World War II. It was a far cry from the village war, that was so frustrating and morally confusing, fought in the midst of Vietnamese civilians who could be innocents or adversaries, that was the signature of Viet Nam War Combat, the kind that Hal Moore so detested (see Moore's comments about his experiences as a Battalion Commander on the Bong Son Plain, several months after the Ia Drang, at pp. 342-343, of We Were Soldiers Once and Young, 1992). Hal Moore is a man of impeccable integrity but his honor is in part, intact because he was in and out of Viet Nam early in the war.
  Undoubtedly, Moore and Galloway lost control of the script once they signed away the rights to film the story, so the final shape of We Were Soldiers rests with the film makers. This is a time for heroes and that's what the final product is about.  Although the content of the battle as portrayed in the book contains enough heroism for any film, the producers contrived heroism  by dawdling for an inexplicably long time in the pre-battle environment of Fort Benning Georgia, rousing speeches and  wives coffee-claches. Also,  the final twenty minutes or so of the film imposes a theatrical charge by Moore's troops into the enemy lines, creating a crisis of  suspense and release for the spectator, when what looks like a heroic fatal charge is transformed into a brilliant maneuver, when an obviously coordinated and finely calibrated  air attack ambushes  the enemy soldiers just as they are about to annihilate Moore's battalion. These editing choices in fact invert the true ambush by North Vietnamese forces that is the rest of the story:  As American Forces were withdrawing from the battle field on November 17, 1965, regrouped North Vietnamese forces  fell on an American Battalion (Not Moore's 1st of the Seventh Regiment, but the 2nd of the 7th ), in an ambush that left 155 Americans dead (Twice the total of the first three days) and hundreds of others wounded. Depiction of this horrifying and spectacular ambush  could have elevated the film to a classic of the tragedy of war,  a story riddled with horror and ambiguity,  much closer to what the War in Viet Nam was about.
  The Ia Drang battle, including the fatal ambush, is now seen by historians like Colonel Moore and Colonel Harry Summers as crucial to the remainder of the war.  The North Vietnamese, unaware of the potency of the air-mobile warfare employed by Moore's battalion, quickly understood that they could not expose their Army to modern American technology. They regrouped and changed their tactics. The Americans didn't. General Westmoreland, seeing a 10-1 kill ratio in favor of American forces, thought this was the strategy to win the war. Poor Westy never got it, and seldom ever again had the luxury of confronting the NVA and Viet Cong in head-on big unit combat. Secretary of Defense McNamara, briefed by Colonel Moore, was smart enough to see the writing on the wall. To his credit he warned President Johnson that it would be extremely difficult to win the war and would require a force commitment that could stretch American power to the breaking point. And of course it is McNamara's cross that he kept his insights and dissent within the Administration.
  Most of all, when it was fought the American government and its military leaders kept the fatal Ambush of November 17, 1965, a secret. Hal Moore's collaborator Joe Galloway dates the rot and corruption in the American effort in Viet Nam from that deception. Ironically in its choice of content and theme We Were Soldiers perpetuates that deceit. The American Soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang campaign and the Viet Nam war generally are honored by this film, but the history of the war is not well served. Too bad. Better luck next time...",1015891200,3,5249,4.79490022172949
1730242,5,B000068TSI,"This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face.
Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle.
A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge.
But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare.
There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson)
remark on the M16. ""It's a good rifle.""
Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to
abuse and missuse. The perellent was dirty and it had to be clean ever fifteen minutes, whole platoons were found with there M16 broken down and cleaning kits out.",1015891200,3,1068,4.510309278350515
1730243,3,B000068TSI,"I found We Were Soldiers to be entertaining, but I found it falling far short of my expectations. Saving Private Ryan (which I consider to be a masterpiece on film) has raised the limbo pole, if you will, of what combat should look like on film. I did not see the look of horror I expected on every soldier's face when the Vietnamese soldiers were firing AK-47 rounds only inches from their faces.
Over and over again the film reminded me of the old John Wayne movies, where the heroes shoot up the bad guys while only the extras are killed or wounded on their team. The Vietnames soldiers were about twelve feet away, yet they scored zero hits on US soldiers in fight after fight. Also, the enemy had zero artillery. Not even so much as a mortar round landed on the American positions. I'm pretty sure that at least some form of artillery would be standard issue for any North Vietnamese division (or any division in the world, for that matter). As cramped as the US solders were in their position, a single mortar crew could have killed them all.

The supporting cast were all wonderful from Barry Pepper playing the journalist.  He too gave such a touching performance of the pain he felt.  The Sargent Major played by Sam Eiliot was great and the chopper pilot by Greg Kinnear was the best I've seen him play.  Madaline Stowe was beautiful in the part of his wife.  She showed the feelings of her love for her husband and what he had to do.  The action scenes were the best I've seen equal to ""Private Ryan"".  And, the musical score was so outstanding, the best yet, that it really touches you.  It's about time the Nam veterans were given a fair shake, instead of always showing them to be crazy people in prior movies.

1730278,4,B000068TSI,"""We Were Soldiers"" is the best movie I have seen so far from this year. Unlike a lot of recent war films, which try to digitize the battle, this film is mostly live action, if not all.
""We Were Soldiers"" is different from a lot of Vietnam War movies in how it shows the soldiers on both sides. The Americans aren't pot-smoking hippies who don't want to be there. They are respectable, sane men who know that they have a duty and do it. As for the Vietnamese, it starts off bad in the beginning scene when their commander orders prisoners taken in battle executed. But the movie soon changes its tone, showing the human side of the enemy so that we sympathize with them. We even grieve when one of them dies. Some can say that these and other film depiction's differ because of the time; this movie takes place early in the war, before we really got dug in.
One of my biggest complaints with ""Pearl Harbor"" was its overdoing of the romance plot, which drew attention away from the attack itself. ""WWS"" does have a romance subplot, involving the wives of the soldiers. But the producers don't overdo this. There are no love triangles, extra-martial affairs, one night stands or anything like that. The producers know that the war is the main plot and focus on that.
I should mention a word on the acting. While no one in here could match Laurence Olivier while playing Shakespeare, they were all very good in their parts. I particularly liked Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Plumley who gets some of the best lines. Particularly memorable are the two encounters he has with an officer that says ""Good Morning"" to him and Gibson's idea to the battalion about family. He tells them about how the warriors in Crazy Horse's tribe referred to all older women as mother and all older men as grandfather. Plumley doesn't particularly like that idea, as he bluntly points out to the troops.
However, I have to show a balanced argument. The only compliant I had with this movie was the lack of time spent on the training of the soldiers as compared with say ""Full Metal Jacket"". But this barely tarnishes an otherwise a great movie. But don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself.",1015718400,,2171,4.540816326530612

1730280,2,B000068TSI,"Randall Wallace has turned a true story of valor and patriotism into an overblown, gory, corny mess.  Mel Gibson is one of the few actors who could anchor this film with his star persona, but he can't save this film from its own false heart.  The scenes involving the wives of the soldiers, sitting around the coffee table and discussing racial equality, are borderline comic.  As an air force brat, I lived through these years and watched my father leave the house on many mornings -- and I watched my mother's galvanized terror and fear.  There is none of that here.  On the battlefield, the blood virtually never stops flowing, in ways that make you think that the director kept trying to find new, novel ways of making a body explode -- so much so that he actually lets blood drip onto the camera, which of course reminds you that you are watching a movie.  While I admire the man (Moore)behind Gibson's character, the simplistic way in which the Vietnam war and its participants are handled -- including an absurdly PC epilogue involving the Viet Cong leader and an American flag -- felt false at every turn.  It's a big, noisy war epic, signifying nothing.",1015718400,8,1162,4.639024390243902
1730281,2,B000068TSI,"the first half hour of this movie is a series of rushed overdramatic moments, each of which sets up a potential plotline which does not deepen significantly throughout the movie. these scenes, ranging from a take on racism of the day, to a soldier who helped orphans in africa before being commissioned (???), to one of the pregnant wives water breaking, all felt like they were crammed into the movie.  the writers should have stuck with one of these plotlines, and followed it through the movie in depth instead they attempted to cram many very different plotlines into one movie, and did not acheive any level of depth at any of them. the movie also attempted to reach out to viewers who were women and minorities so as not to alienate any potential customers, but ironically relied on stereotypes for both, characterising many of the women as bubbleheaded, and relying on stereotypes of the archetypal ""fiercly independent black woman"" for one such wife. many of the scenes in the movie were simply unrealistic, such as the japanese american soldier introducing himself to a reporter with a beaming smile, and informing him that his son is due to be born, in the middle of a raging firefight. i suppose these were attempts at irony, but they failed miserably in my opinion, becoming simply unrealistic. overall, i felt that this movie was very contrived, made in the wake of saving private ryan in a ""it looks like war movies are selling, so lets make one"" frenzy. it attempted to encorporate elements found in both ""black hawk down"" (yes, I know they started making we were soldiers before black hawk down's release) and ""the thin red line."" it failed at both, creating a movie which lacked depth of any form.

The emotion that's in this movie can't be beaten. And I think it's one of the best films released this year - Mel Gibson's performance as Lt. Col Moore is amazing and should be Oscar nominated.
I also loved the narration in the movie. It's true that Vietnam wasn't a popular war and the soldiers that gave their life and the ones that made it and ones were injured - in fact were rarely shown as heroes as they fought the war that no one else wanted to fight.
The war scenes are amazing - you can see the bombs coming down, soldiers on both sides being killed and the ones that were badly injured.
The camera work on this film was one of the best I've seen in such a long time. And the movie ends with a touching tribute to the soldiers that gave their lives.
Also the film goes between the US Army, the Vietnamese soldiers and the wives at home - especially when Madeline Stowe who plays Gibson's wife and Keri Russell handing out telegrams to widows of the soldiers.

1730283,4,B000068TSI,We Were Soldiers is one of the few good vietnam war movies.  The characters are pretty interesting and sometimes help lighten the mood of the war.

1730293,5,B000068TSI,"I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal.  Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it.  I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films.  He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it.  And about one and all he says: ""It wasn't like that.""
He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought.  He said, ""They finally got it.  That's what it was like.  All the details are right.  The actors were just like the men I knew.  They looked like that and they talked like that.  And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew.""  The he was silent for a long time.  At last he said, ""You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off?  Something like that happened to me once.  It was at a helicopter crash.  I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off.  It looked just like that, too.  I've never told any one about it.""
In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground.  And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful.  Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film.  It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.
Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds.  Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield.  The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue.  The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a ""you are there"" quality that is very powerful.
Randy did have a criticism.  ""I don't think there would be time for casualty telegrams to actually get home while the battle was going on,"" he said.  ""After all, it only lasted three days.""  I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place.  And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd.  But these are nit-picky quibbles.  WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie.  I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: ""It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie.  I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie.  But they get everything right.  That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.""",1015632000,880,4090,4.353562005277045
1730294,5,B000068TSI,"I went into my first viewing of We Were Soldiers with high expectations(I have seen it twice now, and plan to see it again) Being a Mel Gibson fan, as well as a war movie aficionado, I could hardly wait to see this screen interpretation of retired Lt. General(Colonel at the time of the battle)Harold Moore's novel entitled We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, a true account of the first battle of the Vietnam War which involved American soldiers in combat. The movie covers the events leading up to the battle, including the massacre of a French regiment in 1954, 11 years before the battle takes place, which plays a role in Col. Moore's battle strategy against a much larger Vietnamese army. The story develops several important characters. Gibson delivers another rock-solid performance as Col. Moore, a highly intelligent and seasoned commander whose life is guided by a firm dedication to his family and his country. A quick note: Mel Gibson is seriously considering retiring from acting to focus on producing, which will allow him to spend more time with his wife and seven kids. His next movie, Signs(from the wrier/director of The Sixth Sense, which is done filming, may be his last as a lead actor, so relish this one if enoying watching his performances. Madeline Stowe is excellent as his wife, Julie. Some of the most emotional moments in the movie occur when Mrs. Moore takes on the difficult task of informing some of the other wives of their husbands' deaths in battle. Sam Elliott(Tombstone) turns in an excellent performance as Col Moore's 2nd in command, Sgt. Major Plumley. Chris Klein and Keri Russell do a fine job as Lt. Jack Geoghegan and his wife Barbara, who have a child shortly before the fighting begins. Greg Kinnear once again delivers as Major Bruce Crandall, a helicopter pilot who provides invaluable assistance by transporting supplies and troops, as well as provoding cover fire under extreme pressure. And last but not least is Barry Pepper, who follows up his amazing portrayal of Roger Maris in 61* with another wonderful performance as Joe Galloway, a photograper who risks his life in an attempt to help himself(and his country) understand the nature of  a war that divided this country more than any before it had ever done. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of portraying the American side, but it really distinguishes itself by giving a face(as well as respect) to the Vietnamese soldiers who fought and died along with many American soldiers. Many movies about the this war villianize the Vietnamese people, but this movie takes an important step by showing us a glimpse of the actual people on the other side. While we obviously  give unyielding support to our own soldiers, it is also important to remember that the soldiers on the other side were real people who belived strongly enough in their cause to give their lives for it. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of creating extremely intense and realistic battle scenes. This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you're like me, you want the battle scenes to be as realistic as possible in order to give the most accurate portrayal of what really happened to the men out there. We Were Soldiers is a story about a group of men showing extreme courage and dedication to one another under the most dire circumstances. While one might say that this is a fairly common theme in war movies, let us not forget that this is a TRUE story. The men who died on the battlefield weren't just fictional characters, they were real people with families who died serving their country. These men became a family themselves, and went to extraordinary legnths to help one another. Their dedication and sacrifice  truly somthing to be respected and admired by everyone. We Were Soldiers is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the Vietnam War and the men who fought in it.",1015545600,,3911,4.8083209509658245
1730295,5,B000068TSI,"Speaking from my personal experience with the conflict in Vietnam from 1960 thru 1976, I can highly recommend the film ""We Were Soldiers.""  No one film can tell all the stories of that war, however this one tells in a powerfully graphic story all about this battle.  And it tells it pretty much like it was.  Probably too graphic for most of the younger generation who do not remembmer seeing some to these scenes on the evening news during the 60's and 70's, but I feel it is a ""must see"" for that same and any following generations, especially in view of the current world situation involving the military.
I was in a remote area of Vietnam as a civilian nurse with a civilian health organization, my husband was one of the first advisors to volunteer to go to Vietnam, and served two tours there, the last as an officer on General Westmoreland's staff, my father was in Saigon with AID from 1960 thru 1966 as an engineer advisor to the Vietnamese civilians building Tan Son Nuit Airport, so I feel I have some history with the country and the times.  I remember the first American advisors who were wounded and killed, the first Marines who went down in helicopters and my first case of Napalm burns, they were on Vietnamese children.  The scenes in this film "" We Were Soldiers"" were as realistic as they can be using special effects and special make-up.  The sounds of battle, the helicopter flights, the terror the soldiers on both sides is accurate and necessary.
I once rode a helicopter from Danang to our hospital with an Army Major who gave me his flack jacket to sit on, in those days,  the V.C. would lie on their backs and shoot up at the choppers as they passed over them. Rounds would come up through the bottom of the choppers and those guys were more worried about that wound than any other.
 I also remember the first American woman killed in battle to be a famous war photographer, I attended her memorial service in Saigon.  I feel honored to have known so many of the people whose paths I crossed in Vietnam and I know they would appreciate finally having a realistic film of one small part of that terrible war.
I recommend seeing it if you are over 60 for one reason, and if you are under 60 for another.
Those who cannot remember the horrors of war are doomed to repeat them in the coming generations.  Hopefuly
credible films like ""We Were Soldiers"" will help us to remember these lessons of war.

Until Saving Private Ryan and some of the more recent war movies, did Hollywood finally produce a war movie with a real storyline filled with raw and realistic emotion.  This movie is definitely worthy of that caliber!  Mel Gibson does an incredible job of portraying a real life hero, who is down-to-earth, courageous, and actually very believable and humble.  No big egos here!  These are real men with real fears, real emotion, and real brotherhood.  They fought for America and their President, only to find out they really were fighting for each other.  A nation turned against them, their Commander-in-Chief deceived them, and the only honor they had was the courage they faced on the battlefield.  The stunning performances only enhance the incredible storyline by giving the viewer a real sense of what the Vietnam War was really all about.  While many Americans turned their backs on the veterans of this horrific war, there is a story - about real people with real lives, and real emotions that needed to be told.  It's long overdue, and highly regarded.  This movie tells a story.  It reminds us that there is more to a great war movie than just killing, guts, and blood.  Definitely Oscar worthy!!

""We Were Soldiers"" is fascinating on several fronts: first of all it takes place in 1965 after the defeat of the French in ""Indo-China,"" while all the other films dealing with the Vietnam conflict are ""en medias res"" or in the 1970's. Secondly the Mel Gibson character, Hal Moore is not only a Colonel...but a Harvard scholar and war tactician.  Upon receiving his orders to Vietnam, he researches the French's massacre there as well as that of George Custer at Little Bighorn.  In fact Moore's Regiment is assigned the number 7...the same as Custer's.
We, along with Moore, are thus filled with a deep feeling of dread and forboding much like that engendered by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) as he makes his way towards Col. Kurtz's lair in ""Apocalypse Now.""
Much has been made concerning the battle scenes; and yes they are as graphic as anything in ""Saving Private Ryan"" but the director, Randall Wallace and producer, Mel Gibson should be congratulated for not pulling back from the horror and carnage especially since at several points it seems that Moore's regiment might indeed fall victim to the same fate as Custer's. This film is the exact opposite of the recent ""Black Hawk Down"" in that the war in ""WWS"" is fought on the foot soldier level with Moore right on the scene giving orders and strategizing.
The "" Back Home"" scenes are handled well: barely missing going overboard into the corny and maudlin. Madeline Stowe is stoic, sympathetic and quite beautiful as Moore's wife Julie, who nobly takes it upon herself to deliver the ""US Government regrets to inforn you that"" telegrams that arrive for the surviving wives.
""We Were Soldiers"" is ultimately then, a revisionist war movie; one that harkens back to those of the 1940's like ""Iwo Jima"" and ""Back from Bataan"" in which the American foot soldier is glorified and enobled but it also serves as a reminder that all wars are ultimately paid for with the universal currency of human lives.",1015372800,7,2565,4.889655172413793

Other than that the movie was excellent.  The action was intense and I could feel the tension really build as the movie progressed.
This movie showed very intense action for only a few days of time that went by and really impressed upon me the hell that many of the soldiers and pilots in Vietnam had to endure on a daily basis as they fought against Communism throughout their enlistment.

1730302,4,B000068TSI,"Randall Wallaces couragous at times haunting story about Lt.
Gen Al Moore who led his troops in 1965 in the first major battle
of Vietnam is probly the most honest portrayal of Veitnam it is
in no way as striking and as brillant as Saving Private Ryan the
father of the modern day war film, but it shows Vietnam in a way
that it has never been shown before. As a family man Moore is a
commited father of his children and a loving husband to his wife
,As a soldier he is a caring but gutsy soldier that is willing to
do what he is orderd even though it may cost him the lives of his
company or his own life.
  In 1955 when the French were massacred by the south Vietnamese
Lt, Moore knew that they would be calling him to war and he would
have to make that solem promise to his company that he would look
out for them and bring them back even if any of them fall in war
but he never knew that he would have to make them a promise that
would happen , In a scene that looks like that of Apocalypse Now
the outbound helicopters carry Moore and his men unto the grassy
feilds of Veitnam with only one thought in his head how many will
not come home to there familys and will he ever get to see his own family again.
  Starring into the face of the enimey his men blocked and I'll equiped and seeing them being cut to shreds by enimey fire
the promise that he made to his company all but vanished,The
soldiers wives unsure that they will see there husbands again
children waiting to see if they will ever be able to hug there
father again. This deep in Moore mind as he is in a desprate
battle that someone orderd him to do but he can't turn back,
Wallace also focuses on the enimeys side as we see how the
enimey experiences. When it's all said and done Moore wonders
why he did not fall insead of his soldiers for they did not
come there for honor or country they came there for each
other an inspirering and worth while honest portrayal
of the Veitnam war and how soldiers delt with it.",1015286400,,1983,4.089974293059126
1730322,5,B000068TSI,"This is a very fine movie in its own right. I know comparisons are made to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, however this movie portrays the realism of Vietnam, where the others show the horrors of Somalia and World War 2. The comparison should stop there. Having served in Vietnam some 5 years after the conclusion of this battle...I have some recollections as to how these things came down. It was very hard for me to sit through this movie...the realism is very good and the acting fine. I had a small problem with Mel Gibson as Colonel Moore, sounding a bit ""John Wayneish"", almost like he patterned himself after Mr. Wayne, but aside from that he still gave a good performance.  Sam Elliot's performance as the unit's Sergeant Major is the highlight of the movie and although some of it is lighthearted in the early part of the movie, his character is totally believable. I would hope that those who wanted to know more about Vietnam would see this movie, and I would hope that those who are afraid it would bring back memories would see it too, we need not forget these men whom so bravely gave their lives for our country, as they have in all wars and as they do now, and I would hope that in the last few moments of the movie , when they show the casualties from this battle and the fact that there were 58,000 more, that each viewer would take a little more pride in who we are as Americans and as patriots, and what that means.",1015200000,8,1444,4.368029739776952

1730325,2,B000068TSI,"Written and directed by Randall Wallace (w/d of The Man in the Iron Mask) We Were Soldiers is yet another film based on true events and real people, yet the people are as two-dimensional as paper.  If you're going to see this film only for the big blasts, bombs, gunfire, and showbiz effects, then you'll be satisfied because there's plenty of that.  However, when I see a film advertized as being based on a true story, I want to go further than the explosions, and learn about the people.  This film offered little of that.
Mel Gibson is our central character, Lt. Colonel Moore, and his wife is portrayed by Madeline Stowe.  Both these actors do wonders with the little they are given, yet even then, it is not enough to make us emotionally involved.  As the Lt. Col.'s wife, Stowe would host the wives' meetings at her house.  ""Issue one--where do we go shop when the commissary is out of something?  Does anyone know of a place to go?  Issue two--laundry.  The places on base are not reliable.  Does anyone know of someplace better?""
I can't imagine women sitting around talking about such absolutely idiotic piffle when their husbands are out there in Vietnam getting shot at in a bloody massacre.  One could argue they were trying to focus on something else.  One could argue they were trying to deal with things within their own realm.  Okay, fine.  HOWEVER, when I DON'T see them crying, flipping out, talking about their husbands, talking about how much they love them, and are instead discussing laundry and shopping, I have to say a grand part of the equation is missing. The only time the wives were allowed to show emotion was when they were delivered the ever-so dreaded telegram informing them their husband is dead.  Are they not allowed to care for their men UNTIL then?
Think of the opposite as well:  how would their husbands feel knowing while they is at war their wives' biggest concern was getting the whites clean, or finding tatter tots in the frozen foods section?  ""Yeah, I'm out here getting shot at so I can go back home and live with a woman who's biggest worry is having enough quarters for the laudromat.  Now THAT'S love."" Can you see how I say this film lacks credibility, IN SPITE of it being a true story?
Wallace's script lacks emotion and believability, and makes us less able to mourn those who perish on the battle field.  Do I really care about these men?  Their wives don't seem to, so why should I?
Also given the impossible task of making a character real are the very formidible Sam Elliot and Greg Kinnear.  Poor Sam.  He is a splendid actor, yet his dialogue was reduced to nothing but one-liner quips, usually with some sort of appropriate expletive in it--I wish I could list some of them in this review as they came off absolutely hilarious.  However,this man is a very capable actor--why would Wallace want to waste him like this?  Same with Kinnear, whose role is limited to being in a helicopter.  This Oscar-nominated talent is given only two major scenes in the entire film.  Waste!
Like I said, if you like explosions, then see it.  If you want to be moved by the characters and learn something about Vietnam, perhaps renting Platoon will be a better option.",1015113600,9,3214,4.612676056338028

Greg Kinnear is a helicopter pilot, and Barry Pepper is a photojournalist who is in the middle of the battle.

As he did so well in THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson performs marvelously as the American general (granted, he was no MacArthur, but who else was?!) and gives an award-winning, heart-rending, authentic acting so sincere that his tears cause the moviegoer to respond in kind.  He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good, Southern gentleman turned soldier.  There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town.  It breaks your heart when you see that yellow taxi's appearance; I almost had a heart attack when the general's wife looked out and saw it that last time.

It also pays tribute to the wives and family left behind in the states. Every day for them was one of fear and uncertaintly also. The acting is first rate with Sam Elliott standing out in, what I feel, is the role of his career as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley.  The combat sequences are breathtaking in their portrayal of the death and carnage that took place at X-Ray.

1730341,5,B000068TSI,"Silence. Complete silence. As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French. The opening sequence is a massacre ten years prior to the Vietnam conflict involving the French. It establishes what the American's would have to face later. As the American soldier's begin to fall, telegram's arrive back on base notifying their wives of their death. The band that the women formed was also inspiring, and how unbelievably strong they must have been. Leaving the theater, I told myself never to forget We Were Soldier's, nor the sacrifice our men, like my own uncle. After watching the world seem to fall apart last year, it's good to remember that even at this moment our men are serving their country every day. Close friend's, and family. Sacrifice's were made in Vietnam for a reason that we are still searching for. If any of our brother veteran's happens to read this simple review, take a higher meaning and the most gracious thought's when I say thank you. They were Soldier's once, and Young.

Take a look at the slow-motion violence of Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" and multiply that by about one hundred.  It's not just the slow-motion stuff, this movie makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" look like something you would see on the Disney channel.  I won't say what the types of violence were that made me wince, but it had something to do with napalm.  There's definitely some Oscar worthy cinematography in the film.  This movie really made me feel like I was in the war.  If you are, or know someone that wants to go to war to win medals, be a hero, or something like that, then see this movie first.  It did change my view of war, war isn't honarable or heroic, or glorious, it's just depressing and scary.  This is probably one of the most scary movies I've seen, and it's a war movie.  The acting is good but not great, Mel Gibson does a nice job as Col. Moore, and Sam Elliot (Sgt. Plumley) is in this for comic relief, maybe so the audience won't get too depressed.

The combat scenes were as intense but I felt more engaged by the unfolding tragedy.  BHD is also a great war movie, but it seemed to rely on more special effects to create it's impact.  There is a review here that picks the movie apart, but I don't believe anyone will care about the small points the author is trying to make.  Who really cares if Col. Moore invented the tactics?  And it's always easy to criticize, after the fact, the tactics that were used in the battle.  It was a new type of warfare, and it was the first time those tactics were used to that extent.  What also made this an enjoyable movie is that it wasn't made from an ugly American type viewpoint.  The film makers actually believe there is something good and decent about America, and that shined through in the movie.
