8009016,5,B00019PCHG,"Love this! This DVD comes with three Inuyasha episodes and each of them are some of my favorite. My favorite episode in the whole Inuyasha series is Return to the Place Where We First Met, which is found on this DVD.

I highly recommend this to all Inuyasha fans!",1414627200,,263,4.36734693877551
8009017,5,B00019PCHG,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Naraku sends 2 more demons after our heroes. Sensing the danger, Koga shows up to help. Inuyasha, and Koga fight together, sort of, to kill Naraku's newest incarnations. Meanwhile, Kikyo discovers another flaw within Naraku. The heart of the villain that spawned Naraku still beats within him. Kikyo believes that this will allow her to battle Naraku without him being able to kill her.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1532,4.5071942446043165

8009019,5,B00019PCHG,"So Kagome finally realizes she is in love with Inuyasha in this volume in the series.  But he still loves Kikyo, who's like a zombie and should be dead.  What a fool!  On an unrelated note, Miroku rules!",1083628800,,203,4.2894736842105265
8009020,4,B00019PCHG,"The battle with Juromaru and Kageromaru where Koga and Inuyasha team up aside this disk obviously shows they were cleaning the studio that week.  How else could you explain getting a pair of episodes that was mainly soap suds.  Now I think the series needed this slow down to allow our heroes time to reflect on relationships, but will someone please smack Inuyasha!  Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him.  He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least.  Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her.  How many more evil things does this dead priestess have to do before he gets a clue that the Kikyo he fell in love with is no longer going by that name?",1083628800,5,854,4.47741935483871
8009021,5,B00019PCHG,"This is one of the best InuYasha dvd's that has been released. It has two more of Naraku's  incarnations Juromaru, and Kageromaru. And Koga is also in this one so it has a nice twist.
Then Naraku starts to develope feelings for Kikyo and sends a  demon after her in hopes of killing her. What will InuYasha do. If you want to know buy this dvd.",1083542400,2,344,4.196969696969697
8009022,5,B00019PCHG,I love the last episode on this DVD......Inuyasha has a hard time of letting Kikyo go but also Kagome.  Kagome realize she is love with Inuyasha and Inuyasha starts to realize his feelings for Kagome.  Kagome soon returns to Inuyasha to tell her that she has a desire to be with him.  Inuyasha and Kagome walked back to the village holding hands.,1078358400,6,346,4.548387096774194
