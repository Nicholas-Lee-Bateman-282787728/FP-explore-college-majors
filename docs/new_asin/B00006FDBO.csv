1749332,5,B00006FDBO,"Eaten Alive - Another film from Umberto Lenzi, famed director of Cannibal Ferox. This one is about a beautiful blonde-haired bombshell who is searching for her sister in the jungle. She gets help from an adventurous Indiana Jones type guy just a lot less cartoony. On their way they see a display of cannibalism before them from a local tribe and are understandably frightened by this and now want to get as far away from this area as possible. They are soon captured though by a tribe, but they soon find out it isn't the cannibal tribe but one that her sister belongs to, that has a good number of english-speaking Americans in it. They are brought to the tribe's town that they live in and protect from the cannibals inhabiting the surrounding jungle. The tribe's leader is an American who believes in ""purification"" and such, something to do with cleansing yourself. For instance no alcohol is allowed in this place and if this guy finds you with it, consider yourself next to be carted out of the place, given a gun and a flashlight and then told ""good luck with the cannibals"". There is a funeral procession occuring and the main character, miss blonde bombshell, spots her brunnette sister as part of the procession. They watch as the widow of the man the funeral is for is systematically screwed by her three brother-in-laws to ""break the ties of marriage"". Afterwards our protagonist finally gets a chance to speak with her sister and her sister seems rather adamant about being a part of this tribe and not wanting to leave. Pretty soon our protagonist and the Indiana Jones type dude with her are called for a meeting with everyone else, and everyone is given some odd drink. Indiana Jones dude is given it but refuses to drink saying it's drugged. For this he is tied up and made a prisoner. The blonde drinks it willingly and soon goes into an almost catatonic daze where she follows orders obediently and the ruler of this tribe takes her up to his rooms where he snaps a snake in half spilling it's blood all over a long cylindular object, a dildo. He then begins violently shoving it into our blonde protagonist. All the while the best music you heard in Cannibal Ferox is playing right here. It was this music and the impact of this scene(despite not graphically showing the dildo penetrating her) that got me completely into this movie from this point on. This film has a lot of similiarites to Ferox besides the same music in certain scenes, and those that were fans of it won't be dissapointed. The climax of this one is simply amazing, probably mostly because it was women being butchered and eaten instead of guys this time.  Both are amazing films of the highest caliber of horror movie. Both come very highly recommended from me.",1085788800,16,2753,4.641393442622951
1749333,3,B00006FDBO,"This movie stunk so bad I could almost see the stink lines streaming out from my television.  However, it certainly made me laugh.  Oh, the easily offended need not apply for this one, which is full of nudity, senseless killings and even REAL animal torture.  If you ARE into Troma or just exploitation films in general, CHECK THIS OUT.  It is awful, yet also AWFUL FUNNY.",1071705600,5,372,4.590909090909091
1749334,1,B00006FDBO,"I bought it as additional collection for my recent ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Jungle Holocaust"". But I didn't get anything exciting or at least different.
This movie just inspired by Jim Jones's suicide cult in Guyana. Cannibal rites is just cosmetic. It even doesn't related to the story. The worst are, there are many animal killing and other movie footage. I even can recognize cannibal rites footage from Jungle Holocaust I own. Miserable!!!",1056585600,4,444,5.180555555555555
1749335,3,B00006FDBO,"Lovely heroine Janet Agren tracks her missing sister to the wilds of New Guinea and hires hard-drinking adventurer Robert Kerman to help get her out.  There's double jeopardy this time around--not only is sister Paola Senatore part of a fanatical Jim Jones-style cult, but the jungle surrounding the cult's compound is teeming with hungry cannibals, complete with the usual grungy faces and Ramones-style wigs.  On the Minus side--like many DVDs, this suffers from exteriors that are way too bright, with some outdoor scenes almost white--not a good thing considering how many outdoor scenes there are.  In the Plus column--the late great Ivan Rassimov gnashes the scenery as fanatical cult leader Jonas, and the cannibals give us gorehounds our money's worth.  This film is often held in contempt because many of the ritual butchery and cannibalism scenes were lifted from other movies, namely MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD.  However, this makes EATEN ALIVE a sort of smorgasbord for cannibal fans, and if you can only own one of these gut-munchers maybe EATEN ALIVE/MANGIATI VIVI should be it.  Yum yum, Eat'um UP!!!",1053648000,12,1159,5.171122994652406
1749336,1,B00006FDBO,"I don't know why anybody with an ounce of sanity or a soul would want to watch anything as depraved as this garbage.  I am not a prude when it comes to good horror, even stuff your average viewer finds disturbing, and many of my favorite directors (Cronenberg, Carpenter, Raimi, Romero) come from this genre.  I should have been warned after the first cannibilism scene what was to come and yanked out the DVD and put in a mindless comedy or something.  I stuck it out, and my reward was watching two women being butchered alive.  What amazes me is how horribly realistic the scene was, surrounded by the mediocrity of a 70's B movie.  This is the sort of thing Jeffrey Dahmer might have found entertaining, but I was disturbed that ANYONE would film such a heartless scene to begin with, and that ANYONE would find this degree of inhumanity enjoyable to watch.
I consider myself a pretty well-rounded film buff, having seen much from the classic era, foreign, non-mainstream and so on, but this is the sort of film I can live without.  Film is the art form of our age, combining aspects of literature, culture, history, theater, art and music into one package.  This package, once viewed, becomes part of our thought process, provided we have acheived consiousness to begin with.  We veiw our selves and others within our unique thought processes, which, if filled with dehumanizing input like this becomes dehumanized.  I'm not saying this movie or others like it will turn you to cannibilism.  I was actually pleased to find I hated it so much, because it went against every decent thing I choose to believe about humanity, lessons I've learned from better films.  So for me it was a plus to watch once, but not worth the twenty bucks I could have spent on something more edifying.  So save your money on this piece of trash.  Tod Browning's ""Freaks"" is a better buy.  Or ""Brady Bunch"" reruns.  Or anything...",1047081600,10,1912,4.665671641791045
1749337,4,B00006FDBO,"Yes, its another Italian cannibal film seeing release on DVD. This entry is probably the least in the series but is still well worth the time. The transfer by Media Blasters is acceptable for a film of this age and presenting it in widescreen and uncut is another plus. They are doing a great job with their DVD's of obscure films and are giving them an almost archival restoration. The film itself takes some time to get going but once the characters enter the jungle, all sorts of atrocities engulf them. This film is kind of like a cross between ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Jungle Holocaust"", as there are two seperate storylines going on at once. We have a deranged leader of a group of cultists on one hand and on the other, cannibals. It makes for a rather fun foray if you are into this type of graphically violent kind of stuff. I was suprised to see more than one scene ""cribbed"" from other cannibal movies appear in this. There are scenes from ""Jungle Holocaust"" and one other movie inserted into this, primarily concerned with animal killings and a few bits with the cannibals. A nice bonus is the inclusion of three interview segments, one with the director and two with the male leads. I did find it interesting to learn that the main actor was actually a porn star in the US by the name of R. Bolla-hey you learn something new every day! Anyway, if you are into seventies Italian cannibal films you won't be disappointed with this one.",1039824000,7,1443,4.532567049808429
1749338,1,B00006FDBO,"Another cannibal flick from Umberto Lenzi, this one is pretty bad. The only interesting thing is the extrodinary (authentic) footage of various jungle animals attacking and/or killing each other. The plot concerns an expedition going deep into the jungle (again) to find a missing sister. They come across a cult led by Ivan Rassimov, and they also encounter cannibals (although I can't remember how they fit into the story). As for the gore, it's pretty graphic, but it's also poorly-done and unpleasent. Most of the atrocities are actually kinda boring, especially for those who have seen Lenzi's superior cannibal classic Make Them Die Slowly. The sexually-sadistic scenes in that film were taken to absurd extremes; here they're badly filmed and drawn-out too long.
The film looks and feels like it was thrown together in a few weeks. It may be of interest to bad-movie buffs, but even hardcore horror fans will be disappointed if expecting a quality production. One of Lenzi's worst.",1033430400,5,988,5.104938271604938
1749378,2,B00006FDBO,"An Italian production, Eaten Alive (Mangiati Vivi) is a mind-numbing fantasy adventure set in the jungles of New Guinea, involving cannibals, and a religious cult, similar to that in Jonestown, Guyana.  This film is not for the squeamish, as true to the title, people are indeed eaten alive.  Also served up are ample nudity, dismemberment, sexual abuse, rape, decapitation, severed genetalia, and the butchery of humans and animals.  Does it sound like a fun time?

Sheila Morris (Janet Agren) leaves New York for New Guinea, in search of her older sister Diane (Paola Senatore) who has vanished there.  Upon arrival, she enlists the help of adventurer Mark Butler (Robert Kerman) to act as a guide.  The ill prepared pair head into the jungle, and against long odds, do manage to locate Diana, living at religious sanctuary deep in the wilds, called the `unification village'.  The group is led by the charismatic Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov), who apparently keeps his subjects under control through the use of religion, intimidation, and drugs.  It is a bizarre situation, and Jonas who enjoys abusing women while they are under the influence, soon has Sheila naked and painted gold.  The jungle is infested with cannibals, who make escape from the village nearly impossible.  Butler finds this is true when he attempts an escape, only to be forced to return to the village by the ferocious blood thirsty cannibals.  Enlisting the help of a native woman (Me Me Lai), Butler comes up with a final ill-fated plan for escape.

This version of director Umberto Lenzi's film runs just over 92 minutes long (not the 87 minutes stated on the back cover), and features some shocking scenes of brutality, where people are hacked up and consumed raw, in a most casual manner.  Whether realistic or not, there are few things as terrifying as being on the bottom of the food chain.  The cannibals function similar to a traditional monster, and are turned loose for best dramatic effect.  The religious cult element adds even more campy madness to the mix, pushing matters well over the top.  Jonas rules like an emperor, and he and many in his group, appear remarkably well groomed for living in the middle of a forest.  Sheila's makeup is always immaculate, and her clothes never seem to get dirty.  Butler, the supposed expert, isn't very successful at making his way in the jungle, yet manages to survive.

In the cannibal film genre, this is perhaps one of the less `realistic' entries.  If you have a stout heart, and want some pretty raw thrills, you may want to check this out.  The extras include some interesting interviews with Umberto Lenzi, Robert Kerman, and Ivan Rasimov.  The film is also available as part of the Jungle Horrors Triple Feature, which also includes Jungle Holocaust and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.",1248652800,3,2820,4.91754756871036
1749379,2,B00006FDBO,"This movie gets 2 stars only for it';s gore content. if you are a completest who needs  to see every cannibal gore movie, then by all means check this out... just don't expect much. This movies tries to mix a Jim Jones type cult w/ cannibals. The gore is poorly done. The movie is hard to watch. Not the best of it's genre.",1215993600,,323,4.126984126984127
1749380,3,B00006FDBO,"this film is obviously for cannibal sub-genre completists. but if you're closely acquainted with the other notable cannibal films you will quickly notice one thing: umberto lenzi unabashedly stole whole chunks from other films to put into eaten alive. how copyright laws in italy work is beyond me! it is entertaining for what it is, and anything with kerman or rassimov in it is going to be at least fun for an hour or two. but i cant deny stealing jungle holocaust's scene of me me lai being cut open, gutted, and then having hot rocks thrown into  her chest cavity to cook the meat, cause really every movie should put that scene in at some point. just think of the possibilities!",1177286400,,683,4.598360655737705
1749381,3,B00006FDBO,"This movie i liked, not really good, has that ""Grind house"" feeling in the movie. I remember this movie as ""Emerald Jungle"" though many, many moons ago, but, either way all the same. I also felt, that maybe some scenes were deleted maybe? in the film, but, i could be wrong...its been awhile since i saw the film till now. Anyways, the only bad thing about the film was again the animal killings and that ""let the camera linger on it for awhile"" type attitude towards it, didn't think that was cool..whats up with cannibal movies and animal killings?...i don't get it?...anyways, not a really bad film, but, i would suggest that you rent it first then buy.",1175644800,,656,4.567796610169491
1749382,4,B00006FDBO,"umberto lenzis eaten alive is in my opinion way better than cannibal ferox. the film is so cheesy that its hillarious. the charectors, especially the main male charector, are funny to watch. the mane male charector slaps the female role every 5 minutes so she calms down or so she dosnt give up their hiding place. the worst thing about the film is that there are about 4 or 5 scenes from different cannibal movies including lenzis man from deep river. there are also scenes from lungle holocaust and mountain of the cannibal god, and i don't mean minor scenes, i mean big scenes, mostly gore scenes. the scenes actually shot for the film have some gory moments including a decapitation, an ear being cut off and a cannibalization scene were a breast is cut off. throw in some brutal rape scenes and a topless me me lai and you have yourself a pretty decent exploitation flick.",1167696000,2,877,4.592356687898089
1749383,5,B00006FDBO,"Directed by Umberto Lenzi (Man from Deep River). Brings you the second cannibal movie in the trilogy. First it was Man from Deep River, then is was Eaten Alive, and finally it was Cannibal Ferox (Band in 31 countries). I think this is the best cannibal movie in the trilogy. The gore effects are great and very realistic. There is also animal cruelty that spices the movie up as well as Janet Agren as Sheila Morris is impaled in the lower part of her body (were baby are made) by a wooden dildo.

This is a great movie, a must have for any cannibal collection. A word of advice do not buy the Shriek Show addition is cut. Buy the EC Entertainment version off abay.com for around the same price, that includes a way better cover.",1157673600,3,729,4.360294117647059
1749384,2,B00006FDBO,"Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre.  Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.

I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.

There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.

I was hoping they would take things too far.",1153612800,2,431,4.706666666666667
1749385,3,B00006FDBO,"Umberto Lenzi's ""EATEN ALIVE"" is a must have for exploitaion cannibal genre fans! While not the best of it's genre & not quite as good as Lenzi's cult classic ""CANNIBAL FEROX"" it is still a very disgustingly fun entry with plenty of morbid education to be learned about the animal food chain along with a JonesTown massacre twist wich is something different for this genre makes this one worthy of at least 3 exploitative stars.",1150156800,2,428,4.72
1749386,5,B00006FDBO,"As a fan of the genre, here are some things that stand out in the movie: real animals fighting each other to death, real animals being skinned alive by people, native rituals and dances and incredibly realistic scenes of humans observing themselves being eaten alive, a woman is brutally raped and then parts of her are consumed. There is also some casual racism in the form of the pretty blonde mentioning something about ""watching nig*ers pick cotton"".",1114732800,4,454,4.909090909090909
1749387,4,B00006FDBO,"Good god, I love Media Blasters! Every time you turn around, these guys are unleashing yet another depraved classic from years gone past. It seems that most of the stuff they release are Japanese anime flicks, a genre I haven't gotten into in a serious way yet, but they also make sure to release tons of gooey gorefests that send horror fans into paroxysms of joy. And they go out of their way (usually) to stuff the disc with plenty of supplemental materials like trailers, interviews, and commentaries. That doesn't sound like a big deal since lots of DVDs today contain extras, but it's a lot easier to find someone like Oliver Stone than it is to uncover the whereabouts of Ruggero Deodato or Umberto Lenzi. Heck, these guys actually locate cult favorites like George Eastman and Ivan Rassimov in order to interview them on camera! If you love films that delve deep into the inner recesses of shock cinema, Media Blasters is the place for you. And one film that definitely plumbs the depths is Umberto Lenzi's 1980 gutmuncher ""Mangiati Vivi,"" better known as ""Eaten Alive."" Forget about Tobe Hooper's lame alligator flick of the same name; this one is the real deal.

""Eaten Alive"" is one of the sicker entries in the much beloved cannibal genre. Helmed by the director responsible for the massively entertaining giallo ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids,"" ""Mangiati Vivi"" follows the exploits of one Sheila Morris (Janet Agren) as she attempts to find out what happened to her sister Diana (Paola Senatore). Dear Diana fell in with a Jim Jones knock off named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) and fled to New Guinea with all of her money. At first, we don't know anything about Morris's dilemma, but we do know something isn't quite right in New York City. The film opens with stock footage of the Big Apple as we see a native assassinate some guy with a blow dart coated in poison. A few more poor souls eventually suffer the same fate, which stymies the best efforts of New York's finest. Then Morris arrives on the scene and hooks up with Professor Carter (Mel Ferrer, who also appeared in Hooper's ""Eaten Alive""! What are the chances?), a guy who seems to know all about natives, poison darts, and Jonas. He directs Sheila to Jonas's compound somewhere in Asia, and also puts her in contact with American expatriate Mark (Robert Kerman), a guy who will help find Diana Morris for the right price.

What follows is pure Italian sleaze as Mark and Sheila tramp through the jungle to find Jonas's compound. After a short stop off at an abandoned village, where the two nearly perish in a nasty encounter with a cobra, they finally stumble into Jonas's ""purification village."" Then the film gets nasty. It doesn't take too long to discover that Jonas is an unbalanced cult leader who will stop at nothing to protect his flock from outsiders. There's also a tribe of dangerous cannibals nearby, a tribe that nearly finished off Mark and Sheila on their journey into the village. Jonas and the cannibals don't get along at all, but there is a benefit to having a bunch of flesh eaters hovering around the perimeter; they keep the followers in a perpetual state of fear, which keeps them inside the camp for further mind control fun and games. How does Jonas keep his followers in line? He makes them drink some sort of juice that turns them into mindless automatons, for starters, and then moves to the tried and true methods of torture, murder, and banishment of dissenters into the cannibal camp. Soon, Sheila Morris falls under Jonas's wicked enchantments, leaving it up to Mark and Diana to plan the inevitable escape.

It's a bit frustrating to review a film like ""Mangiati Vivi"" because you can't talk in depth about the atrocities. Lenzi throws out a bit of everything, not only recreating the Jim Jones massacre on a small scale, grape kool aid and all, but also subjecting us to cannibal atrocities. The final scenes, with Diana Morris and cannibal film regular Me Me Lai falling prey to the cannibals, ranks right up there with anything you see in Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust."" And for good reason--because Lenzi STOLE chunks of it from Deodato's ""Jungle Holocaust"" feature. He also borrowed footage from Sergio Martino's ""Slave of the Cannibal God."" Oops. Plagiarism aside, this stuff is so deeply disturbing and shockingly realistic, at least in certain parts, that one boggles over how something like this ever got made. The answer probably lies in the fact that these movies largely appeared in the 1970s, a time when almost anything went in cinema. There's no way something like ""Mangiati Vivi"" would play in theaters today, and definitely no way that Lenzi could secure financing for such an extreme film. If anybody in Hollywood tried to pass this one off on a studio, his or her career would permanently suffer.

Extras on the disc include interviews with Robert Kerman, Ivan Rassimov, and Umberto Lenzi; poster and film stills; and five awesome trailers for such schlock classics as Bruno Mattei's ""Zombi 3,"" ""Zombi Holocaust,"" ""Jungle Holocaust,"" ""Zombie 4,"" and ""Mangiati Vivi."" Listening to these interviews is a lot of fun, especially Robert Kerman's. I would never have suspected that he went on to a lengthy career in the adult film business after this movie! Unfortunately, Rassimov's talk is less interesting because he doesn't seem to remember much about making the movie. If you feel like jumping into the gory cannibal genre, you will find plenty here to wet your whistle. Make sure to watch ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""Jungle Holocaust,"" and the tamer ""Slave of the Cannibal God"" soon after.",1100649600,37,5606,4.8547544409613375
