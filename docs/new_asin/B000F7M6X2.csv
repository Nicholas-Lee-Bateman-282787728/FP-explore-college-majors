A nemesis Luftwaffe leader (General Goering?) would have been nice. The DVD print is not well restored though, unfortunately. Still decent enough but don't expect HD here.",1526342400,,287,5.127659574468085
8118676,4,B000F7M6X2,"The uniforms and equipment seem to be quite accurate - but I'd like to hear from the actual Bomber Command veterans on this.  The actors appeared to be too old, on average, to have represented the RAF Bomber Command crews, at least according to photographs that I've seen.  The actors' haircuts are hilariously long (1970s-style), and are completely inappropriate for the times depicted!  Also, Lancasters flew in raids in large numbers, yet this show had an absurdly small cast, and apparently a budget that prevented use of ""extras"".  At least the briefing rooms could have been packed.  The music chosen for this series is really tiresome, too.",1461974400,,647,5.009345794392523
