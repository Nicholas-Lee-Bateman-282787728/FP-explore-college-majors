8449555,5,B004Z9BA06,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Compelling and engrossing as the story quickly unfolds over a very short time. No idea why this is not more easily available. It's in PAL format (as it comes from the UK), so it won't play in everything. Be cautious of that little detail!",1461110400,,284,4.480769230769231
8449556,1,B004Z9BA06,I didn't realize this was for region 2 and had to return it.  I don't know why a region 2 DVD is being sold in the United States's region one market.,1403222400,,149,3.806451612903226
8449557,2,B004Z9BA06,"The video was foreign region coded, so could not be played in a US DVD player. It did not state what region it was either on the DVD case or on the DVD itself. It is very beautifully done, entertaining History Channel program, but just couldn't be played in any of my DVD players, except my laptop which had a multi-region DVD playing capability. So my disappointment with it was with the company that produces this DVD, and not with the seller themself. Surprised that the company that produces this DVD would make such a glaring and important oversight.",1367798400,4,555,4.616161616161616
