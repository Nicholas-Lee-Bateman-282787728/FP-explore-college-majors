ElectraWoman and DynaGirl was always my favorite, and it  was a wonderful nostalgic rush to see these episodes again. Great, great  stuff.",960768000,8,447,5.082191780821918
1087137,5,6305826803,"As a young girl I would run to the TV every Saturday morning with my bowl of cereal to watch Electra Woman.  She was gorgeous...she was sassy...she always outsmarted the bad guys...and she had a really REALLY cool outfit.  ;>
Now, all these years later, I am still a huge fan of the lovely  Deidre Hall.  But for many reasons other than just my childhood fixation on  Electra Woman.  She's warm, gracious, witty and exudes a regal style that  puts her in an elite class of true ladies in the entertainment  industry.
How thrilling it was to see that Electra Woman & Dyna Girl  was being made available on videotape.  It's a creative, cute and fun  program that's sure to entertain the children of today as much as it did 25  years ago when they graced the TV screen.
In a day of Teletubbies and  Pokemon, I can say Electra Woman will bring a refreshing smile to your TV  and be a great new hero for your children.
I give Ms. Hall and this new  release each a perfect 5-star rating.  I know you will all enjoy this  wonderful blast from the past!",959126400,12,1045,4.331606217616581
7897578,4,6305826803,The main reason I am got this VHS is for nostalgic reasons. I remember seeing it as a child way back then and it brings back memories of Saturday mornings. Electrawoman and Dyangirl are campy and cheesy but still fun. Also there was the added attraction of seeing two pretty girls running around in tights. So just looking back at that time and those feelings are reason enough to get this tape. I just hope it comes out on DVD with all the episodes. That will be a real trip down memory lane!,1049155200,6,493,4.311827956989247
7897579,5,6305826803,"The best thing about Electra Woman and DynaGirl is that
DynaGirl's one-liners were so much like Robin the Boy Wonder's in the campy live-action Batman. (1966-68), and they were SO lame! Phrases like ""Electra-wow!"" still resound in my memory. I admit, was older than the other reviewers, when it came out. The show was so naive and
innocent, so politically incorrect, so Batman. Electra Woman
and DynaGirl were played to the campy hilt by then-
unknowns Diedre Hall, (DOOL and Our House), and Judy Strangis. They had a computer nerd who did all their leg work for them. ""Electra-wow!""",1034640000,7,583,4.898989898989899
7897580,5,6305826803,"Electra Woman and Dynagirl was one of my favorite cartoons of the 70's, I watched it on the Krofft Supershow when I was about 4 years-old, and now that I have this video, I still enjoy watching it, and I even had a crush on Deidre Hall and Judy Strangis one time recently while I was watching this video. I also wish that Deidra Hall and Judy Strangis would play Electra Woman and Dynagirl again in a brand new series!",1034294400,5,418,4.2375
7897581,5,6305826803,"Yes, even sexier than Batgirl. [....]
There's really nothing I can add to what's already been written about these lovely young superheroines, except RHINO, RELEASE MORE ELECTRAWOMAN AND DYNAGIRL! I want to see the Spider Lady episode! I want to see the Koptic Eye episode! Or any episode where they get hypnotized! Can you believe that Rhino could release two volumes of ""Pink Lady & Jeff"" but only one of ElectraWoman and DynaGirl? MORE ELECTRAWOMAN AND DYNAGIRL! Please.",1024617600,9,472,5.064102564102564
7897582,4,6305826803,"With Campy stuff like this with cookie cutter special effects, the people involved with it can take two ways of going about it:
1. Do it grudgingly, for the paycheck.
2. Have fun with it and revel in it's particular goofiness.
Fortunataly, Electrawoman and Dynagirl was made by people who seem to occupy the second catagory.
Both Dedre and Judy look like they are having a blast being in those outfits and trotting around on those high school play style sets. Not too mention holding up the gadgets that have the standard electronic switch buttons that you can buy from Radio Shack.
Judy puts a lot of ""oommmph"" in her every ""Electa..."" exclamation. They both seem to get a kick out of uttering the campy cornball dialog.
Electrawoman and Dynagirl is of course a blow by blow rip off of Batman and Robin. Complete with the underground cave, the special car (which looks like a disco dune buggy), flamboyant over the top villians and the duel older and younger costumed heroes whom you always suspected were just a bit too close for comfort.
For us guys though, Electrawoman and Dynagirl are 10 times more adorable than Batman and Robin.
The wobbely special effects really fun to see. It takes you back to the time when you were young and you found a way in your mind to believe even the worst special effects.
For the Children of 70's pop culture, you can't go wrong with this tape. You'll have tons of Electrafun. I wish it was a four episode tape instead of a two episode deal though.
The quality of the tape is the best that it can be. It has the soft look common for 1970's videotaped programs but retains the clean, new look of video. Which makes it look a little weird considering the vintage...",1017273600,24,1701,4.543973941368078
7897583,3,6305826803,This tape brings back memories. It's ok but the special effects and story lines are corny. As a kid growing up in the 1970's I didn't notice it. This is truly a poor female version of the 1960's Batman series. You have to be a true super hero fan to enjoy this one.,1013472000,3,265,4.018867924528302
7897584,4,6305826803,"I was a young boy when Electra Woman and Dyna Girl came on tv.  I was immediately attracted to the beautiful blonde crime fighter and her  sidekick.  It was a female version of Batman, and these crimefighters were  much easier on this then young boy's eyes.  I am so happy these shows are  on tape again.  My nephews love the shows too.",966297600,5,336,4.32258064516129
7897585,4,6305826803,"Well - what can be said - we know its a silly show - but you have to admit they had guts filming it - of course I'm sure poor Dirdre is cringing when she's going to the video store now! LOL - but you definately knew that CSO  was in - COlor Seperation Overlay - for those Electra-WOW special  effects!
Anyway - I think its still a little pricey for what it is - but  it's a good run down memory lane regardless!",964828800,3,411,3.869047619047619
7897586,4,6305826803,"I agree with other reviewers who thought the special effects were laughable...truth is, Electra Woman & DynaGirl lasted only eight episodes for the chief reason that it was, perhaps, far ahead of its time.  The Glitter Rock episode was far better than the Sorcerer one, mainly  because many of the technological features, such as satellites, electronic  eyes and Crimescope's fax machine were presented in a brilliant fashion for  1976.  The Glitter Rock story also led to a ninth episode of EWDG,  ""Blood On Her Hands"", which can only be found in printed form on  the EWDG website.  I look forward to the other six episodes being released  by Rhino.",962323200,13,650,4.889908256880734
