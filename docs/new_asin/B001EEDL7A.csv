8297939,4,B001EEDL7A,"Very good film about the biography of these two famous magicians of all times.
I recommned it for a real fan of SARMOTI !!!
This is a good souvenir of all they have created in Las Vegas... that unforgetable performance of illusions.
It would be more interesting to have a DVD with the whole spectacle of magic as we saw it at The Mirage, some years ago.",1264809600,,353,4.2835820895522385
