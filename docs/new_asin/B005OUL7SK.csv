4855049,5,B005OUL7SK,"This was probably one of the best yoga DVDs I have done in terms of strength training. I actually walked away feeling a little like jelly in my legs (I love that feeling). I have done the meditation ONCE, which was a little strange. I might just not be a meditating type. More here [...]",1326240000,2,287,4.236363636363636
4855050,5,B005OUL7SK,"This is a comprehensive yoga practice. About 45 minutes long and will stretch and tone every part of your body. I have been doing this a few times a week for the past few weeks and I still get sore. It is also very helpful for back pain. Highly recommended.

The meditation with Deepak is just music. I thought it would be a guided meditation but it is not. He guides you in breathing for the first minute or so and that is all.",1325376000,4,428,4.095238095238095
4855051,3,B005OUL7SK,"Tara Stiles has introduced me to enjoying yoga, when no one else could before..... However......

Having had Tara's Jane Fonda Daily Yoga dvd for a while now, I was very excited when my 2 new dvds arrived in the post.  That feeling didn't last very long.  Just as the previous reviewer, J.T stated - it is exactly the same thing! It is just with a different background and with 3 girls doing the routine.

There is a LOT of noise interference due to the wind attacking the microphones, which is quite distracting.(And the background music actually makes me want to lay down and sleep.)
If you have Tara's Jane Fonda dvd - don't bother buying this or the weight loss one.  I actually feel like I get a better workout just doing the JF one - as opposed to doing either of this set individually.

If you are considering buying this series - please just do yourself a favor and buy the Jane Fonda dvd. It is basically both of these ""weight loss"" and ""strength /energy"" dvds combined into one.
Massively disappointed after a long wait for them to arrive all the way to Australia (never mind the postage fee)
The meditation section is nothing you can't find on the internet with Deepak.
I was hoping at least for maybe some more explanations of poses or something of the sort - but sadly not. I got VERY sick of hearing her say ""nice you guys"".

These dvds will either gather dust in my cupboard or go on ebay. But my original one - the Jane Fonda Daily Yoga Workout, will still get a good run throughout my week - as I love it and feel fantastic every time.  Maybe i'll buy the ""New York Sessions"" one - unless anyone says it's also the same thing.

I don't want to sound too negative as I have really enjoyed combining a few of her podcasts together to form a longer routine, as well as the dvd I have - it's just that this ""new"" series doesn't actually offer anything new or different.",1324512000,32,1882,4.354285714285714
4855052,5,B005OUL7SK,"I found Tara Stiles almost exactly a year ago on YouTube. Not long after, I purchased her book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slim-Calm-Sexy-Yoga-210-Proven-Yoga-Moves-for-Mind-Body-Bliss/dp/1605295566/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slim Calm Sexy Yoga: 210 Proven Yoga Moves for Mind/Body Bliss</a>&nbsp;(which I cannot recommend enough) and have maintained a daily yoga practice since.

I was happy to find this workout to be challenging yet extremely fun at the same time. It helps you to push yourself past your limits (but not too far!) and locate areas which need improvement. At the end of the routine, I always feel simultaneously relaxed and invigorated.

Tara's instruction is great, and the filming location, Joshua Tree, is simply beautiful. Overall, it is a very fun routine, never boring and perfect for beginners or seasoned pros alike. Highly recommended!

P.S. Don't forget to pickup a copy of Slim, Calm, Sexy. You won't regret it!",1323648000,17,989,6.100719424460432
4855053,5,B005OUL7SK,"I've done this yoga routine twice so far and I really like it. It's filmed in Joshua Tree, which makes for such cool scenery. I love the routine and I really do feel energized afterwards. Tara's instruction is very calming and down to earth, I can follow along without looking at the screen if I want, and the best part is-- I know I won't get tired of doing this dvd -- mostly because her instruction is great. (And there's nothing annoying that you would get tired of hearing after repeated views--which is something I've experienced with other fitness dvds)

Anyway, it's awesome and I highly recommend it :)",1323388800,5,611,4.605504587155964
4855054,4,B005OUL7SK,I am new to yoga and really like Tara's commentary thru the work-out. She is always reminding us to breath and be comfortable. I feel good after the workouts.,1434067200,,158,4.482758620689655
4855055,5,B005OUL7SK,"I have purchased 5 different yoga videos and this is by far my favorite. If you want a well-paced,good work out without having to have the arcane knowledge of a devout Yogi and the terminology to follow along, this is the ticket.",1433376000,,229,4.476190476190476
4855056,2,B005OUL7SK,It is not what I expected.  I thought Deepak Chopra was going to do the yoga also.  This is really for younger people or people who have done yoga for years.,1418169600,,157,4.032258064516129
4855057,2,B005OUL7SK,Too fast  for me ... I love Deepak but the video is for more advance practitioners,1415577600,,82,4.125

4855061,2,B005OUL7SK,"Very disappointed in the delivery of this yoga teacher.  She teaches more like a fitness instructor than a yoga instructor.  Poor attention to breathing, poses.  Simply moves through poses as if she were teaching an aerobics class.  I do like Depak Chopra's meditation, however.",1400976000,2,278,5.25
4855062,5,B005OUL7SK,"I love Tara Stiles! This workout is a bit harder than the Weightloss DVD, but I've found I've built up strength fast. I like to alternate this one and the Weightloss DVD for a well rounded, not boring workout.

Beware this one has lots of downward dog splits! :)",1396137600,,262,4.346938775510204
4855063,5,B005OUL7SK,Fantastic.  One of best out there.  Both Deepak and Tara are great.  Good workout and cool setting.  Meditation part also good.,1395878400,,127,4.904761904761905
4855064,2,B005OUL7SK,The wind interfere with DVD and understanding the instructor.  Not rated on level of yoga.  This is not a beginner yoga.  I have see Tara Stiles yoga on UTube and found her vocal good.,1393200000,,184,4.352941176470588
4855065,5,B005OUL7SK,Love all my yoga DVD from Tara Stiles and just ordered another one.  I hope Tara makes more so that I can have a collection,1391558400,,123,3.92
4855066,4,B005OUL7SK,"I'm not sure why other reviewers have implied that Tara Stiles does not do ""real"" yoga.  Although she does not spend a lot of time talking about spirituality, she does emphasize the connection between breath and movement and promotes calmness and focus.  This is a well-balanced 50 minute practice which flows very well and works all different parts of the body.  The cuing is very clear (although as others have said, the audio quality is not that great in spots because of the wind).  The poses are not difficult, and the three different students do demonstrate some variations.  The level of intensity is a little higher than I expected, especially in some of the sections where she alternates between a strength move and a balancing pose.  I find I have to push just that little bit beyond my comfort zone, which I know is the best way to get a little better and a little stronger each time.",1388534400,2,895,4.632911392405063
4855067,3,B005OUL7SK,"NICE  yoga flow, have some problems with the bad edition on some parts you can't  listen to the instrustions due the wind sounds on the dvd and you are not able in a couple of parts to see how are the yoga position, due the camara is far far away",1385942400,,246,3.9
4855068,5,B005OUL7SK,Tara Stiles has a way about teaching yoga she always finds the time to explain each position so you don't have to keep looking up to make sure your doing it right! You have the option to turn off her voice after you get used to the workout which I found to be thoughtful because that can get annoying after the 40th time of watching the dvd. After the workout you can slowdown your mind with Deepak Chopra and join in on meditation I think this is a great pair up and good dvd for a beginner I let my sister borrow it to get into the yoga feel she has never done yoga before but she was able to keep up with Tara.,1385078400,,613,3.9516129032258065
4855069,5,B005OUL7SK,"I've been practicing yoga off and on for about ten years. I'm fairly athletic, but I was recently diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is a form of juvenile inflammatory spinal arthritis. This means that there are times when I'm active and there are long periods of time when I'm flaring and can't do much moving around. Yoga Transformation is a balanced 50 minute workout that leaves me feeling like a million bucks after each session. I feel limber and energized after Tara's routines, which is why I love them. There are days when I can't do a lot of yoga, but I've found that I can put this DVD on for 20 minutes and still feel good about myself afterwards. You'll work up a good sweat with this video, and if the moves are too fast or too complicated, they're still achievable. You're not supposed to be able to do everything perfectly right away anyways. That's why it's called a yoga routine. Practice makes perfect. This video gives you something to work towards!",1383696000,,979,4.664739884393064
4855070,5,B005OUL7SK,This DVD was just what I was looking for. I was recently diagnosed with MS and yoga and meditation are great tools for enhancing daily life.,1382054400,,140,4.423076923076923
4855071,5,B005OUL7SK,"Great DVD.  I have Tara Stiles Weight Loss DVD, which is terrific, but this one is a step up in difficulty level.  It's a great workout and you break a sweat.  It has some poses which are not in the Weight Loss DVD that are a little more challenging.  Tara is very good at instruction.",1377129600,2,285,4.127272727272727
4855072,5,B005OUL7SK,The movements are flowing and the setting is gorgeous. Best yoga DVD I have owned! I would highly recommend it.,1363737600,,111,4.6
4855073,5,B005OUL7SK,"The 50 minutes just disappears, that's how great the workout is. As an experienced person at meditation, the meditation portion of the dvd is not that great, but the yoga workout makes it is worth the buy.",1362873600,,205,4.5675675675675675
4855074,5,B005OUL7SK,"Great, I really enjoyed Tara style her gracefulness as she explained and did each pose. An overall great DVD, awesome!",1361577600,,118,4.95

4855076,5,B005OUL7SK,Good yoga - she has a very calming voice.  Good instruction and motivation. Challenging but very do-able.  Offers alternative moves. Haven't tackled the meditation part yet.,1355529600,,173,5.615384615384615
4855077,5,B005OUL7SK,The DVD is more challenging then her weight loss and balance DVD. It is a lot of fun and together they make a good set.,1351036800,2,119,3.8

4855079,5,B005OUL7SK,"I am very athletic, and at an intermediate yoga level I think this is a fantastic DVD. It consists of just a single work out session for 50 minutes. The session is very balanced and a good thorough work out. This feels just like a class at my local studio. This is great, you won't be sorry. The meditation session is also quite nice, just a little long for me at 15 minutes.",1337817600,8,375,4.1506849315068495
4855080,4,B005OUL7SK,"Very happy with this workout. Good for intermediate, easy to follow, not too hard but challenging enough. Really like it.",1336867200,,121,5.1
4855081,5,B005OUL7SK,"I just purchased the weight loss & balance dvd from Tara Stiles after trying it at the library first and have done the same with this one.  After trying it I knew I'd like to put it into my rotation along with Shiva Rea, Sara Ivanhoe, Bryan Kest and Rodney Yee, some of my other favorites.  There are many things I loved about this dvd.  Tara instructs well, though does not do most poses herself, she counts on her three practitioners for that, pointing out good form and walking from person to person.  I know other people can be turned off by this style, so if you are, this might not be for you.  The yoga is what I would consider an intermediate practice and includes classic poses and then some that weren't on her first dvd, like the crow, the eagle,the dolphin and half moon with quite a few planks.  I really enjoyed the flow on this one and the scenery (Joshua Tree) is beautiful.  Overall, I felt that this was a really good practice that I think I will get a lot of use from.  It runs about 50 minutes on the yoga piece then you can go to Deepak Chopra's meditation piece if you would like to take a 15 minute mind clearing break.  This is not guided imagery, so after a few minutes you are left with just the music and changing scenery.  Some will like this, some may find it hard to sit still for the whole 15 minutes.  I find that I really get a lot out of it when I do sit quietly for the time, whether with my eyes closed, or just watching the scenery change on my tv and let my mind just drain of thoughts for a while.

Overall, I did not have cons that bothered me, but would say that if you don't like the instructor not actually doing the poses, you might not like this, if you are bothered by hearing occasional wind in the microphone, then again, there is some of that-I didn't find it distracting but others might.

I enjoyed the dvd and would highly recommend.  I love the poses that are in the dvd, even the ones that I can't quite master yet, like the crow, because I will keep trying and do the variations until one day, hopefully I can do the full version. I would recommend watching a clip on the net or on collage video to see if you like her tone and the style and look of the video. It will give you a good idea on whether it will be your style or not.",1333584000,10,2285,4.117117117117117
4855082,5,B005OUL7SK,This DVD is great for the workout and the meditation. This is not an easy workout and it definitely gets the blood pumping.,1331251200,2,123,4.391304347826087
4855083,2,B005OUL7SK,"This is the antithesis of what I consider ideal yoga instruction. She talks too much and her speech is much too fast and frantic, in direct contrast to her verbal cues to relax and take your time. The wind in the microphone was also distracting and there wasn't a lot of flow to the sequencing. Alas, having the genetics that make you look like a skinny twelve-year old doesn't make you a yoga professional.",1328486400,10,407,4.513513513513513
8482029,1,B005OUL7SK,Instructor repeated nice you guys every few sentences. It was so distracting that I stopped the Workout. The DVD quality looked and sounded like a home video shot in the desert.,1519430400,,177,4.741935483870968
8482030,2,B005OUL7SK,"This would have gotten 5 stars if Tara Stiles had not mentioned the shoulder stand being good for weight loss. I am recovering from an eating disorder and this statement just ruined it for me. Must I always hear about weight loss statements in workout videos? What about fitness for its own sake being enough? This was very triggering and upsetting for me because the title does not talk about weight loss. What about yoga for its own sake? That was the original intention of yoga. It is for union of body, mind and spirit, not weight loss. That makes it goal oriented and takes one out of the moment of what the breathing an asana are for, being present, in the body practicing ahisma, which means, do no harm.  I do  not recommend this video if you are trying to recover from excessive dieting or weight obsessions, which in the West, we all have.
For more info on weight inclusivity listen to Christy Harrison RD, Food Psych podcast and be introduced to what it means to have true health and well being. I am disapointed in Deepak Chopra for touting forced weight loss as well in his books. He is not at fault because the wellness and spritual industries are now well indoctrinated into the fat phobic mindset and selling it as well.

Also, it would be nice if yoga videos offered women of all ages and not just 20-30 somethings.",1514764800,,1332,4.4958677685950414
