7204711,5,B00XZZMY56,"This anime is one of my favorites. It is a very smart and thought provoking slice of life full of great characters and emotion. This is the most ""real"" slice of life I've seen, full of awkward silence and no knights in shining armor who are perfect at everything. If you want real characters and some good laughs, please do yourself a favor and watch this.",1452470400,12,356,4.409090909090909
7204712,5,B00XZZMY56,"This romantic comedy is interesting because it is like the mystery romantic and friendship novel in the point of their suggestive word, dialogue and conversation.
There are three main characters who are a high school guy, Hachiman Hikigaya, and two high school lady, Yukino Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama.
Three person has the same characteristic that they are actually lonely. Such people are called ""BOTCHI"" nowadays in Japan.

Hachiman is smart and often has a too venomous tongue, and not handsome, so he is always alone. Yukino is one of the smartest lady and the most beautiful girl in the school and so much talented other than study. She is the beauty but also often remarks too frankly, so has few friends. Yui is a bit scatterbrain, but beautiful, kind and good-natured lady. She looks like to have some friends but no one is real actually because she is always gauge other ones feeling and cannot say her real mind. So, indeed, Yui is also alone.

The word ""BOTCHI"" is so often used in this story in the sense of lonely, isolated person. I think that one of the theme is how ""BOTCHI"" would be able to form the friendship and the love each other.

Their word or conversation is always suggestive. For example, Hachiman is usually called ""HIKITANI"" by the wrong last name but the few uses the correct ""HIKIGAYA"" to distinguish of the two word for the special meaning.

These three special characterized students belong to volunteer club. They give advices and cooperate to solve the problems in the high school. Hachinan has tendency to use too venomous tongue and has often been misunderstood to be cruel. Yukino also has sharp tongue, but on the other hand, she tries to solve by the smart way.

Yukino and Yui does not like Hachiman at first, but they become to understand his venomous tongues are good way to solve the problems without problems on the other than Hachiman himself and always he sacrifices himself and nobody has unpleasant feeling. Though Yukino and Yui does not recognize, but a bit romantic emotion has been occurring in the minds of Yukino and Yui. Also, Yukino and Hachiman or Yui and Hachiman has the opportunities to go out with but they are not real dates. In this series, Yukino and Yui gradually devote themselves to Hachiman. Yui shows the honest emotion to Hachiman, but Yukino subdue her favor to him.

The high school life are described vividly through the activities and relationship with the other student. For example, Yui are about to lose the tennis game with rival, but Yukino plays the game-changing role and advantageously promotes the tennis game and finally, Hachiman comes from behind for victory. The highlight is the volunteer club work of high school festival. In fact, the vice chairwoman of the committee, Yukino is the real chairman and she accomplishes the works smartly. On the other hand, Hachiman also cooperates by his way and he is misunderstood to be the villain. Though Yukino and Yui does not like his way, but they get to understand he cooperates as their best buddies. I guess that this is the onset of true romantic comedy between Yukino, Yui and Hachiman. The problem to be solved is which lady Hachiman would love in the future.

The storys title includes the word romantic, but their relationship is ambiguous in this first season.

In Japan, 2nd season was broadcast from this spring to summer. In it, the story become somehow more romantic. Please note that this Blu-ray does not contain the 2nd season's stories.",1448064000,7,3488,4.811352253756261
7204713,5,B00XZZMY56,"I LOVE THIS ANIME!! THE MOMENT I GOT IT I THREW THIS IN MY PS3!!

People have already mentioned reasons why this anime is one of their favorites and i share most of thos reasons. So ill just name a few that i are really important to me.

The humor is clever. You really have to pay attention to what they are saying and what those words mean.

The art style is different from most. That might stir people away from this anime but i view it as a plus since it stands out a bit more in my opinion.

The music during certain parts of the anime really match what is being said.

The personalities seem real and relate-able.

Those are my biggest appeals to this anime. Read some other reviews if you want more info.",1442361600,10,711,4.153284671532846

8717267,5,B00XZZMY56,"I simply adore this show, frankly speaking. It has its flaws, and the first season is somewhat meandering, but it bucks a lot of tropes and expectations right out of the gate and never stops.

I'm always of the mind that any work that can generate an emotional reaction out of the reviewer has done it's job. This manages that and more, at least in my case. The humor is on-point, the drama is poignant and believable, and the premise is well-grounded. All around I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys a bit of melodrama.",1498953600,,524,4.515789473684211

8717270,5,B00XZZMY56,"Brilliant through and through. Don't let the word ""Teen"" misguide you. Japan doesn't look down on youth intellectually with their shows, this has substance and it's by no means comparable to western versions of sitcoms.  ""My Youth Romantic Comedy is Wrong as I Expected"" it's a well put together Social Psychology that can most definitely be refreshing to watch for any age.",1473984000,,374,5.032258064516129
8717271,5,B00XZZMY56,"One of the best romcoms I've ever come across. Hachiman is quite possibly one of the more interesting characters you'd see in this genre, or just any show. This is definitely something I'd recommend to anyone who loves romance comedies. I'm looking forward to purchasing season 2 as well.",1464739200,,288,4.8979591836734695

8717273,4,B00XZZMY56,"I really enjoyed watching this anime alot, its very entertaining. About 2/3 of the episodes are just perfect. I just think the show is a bit incomplete, the last 4 episodes are a bit less entertaining, and well since it is a romantic comedy, i guess i was just expecting a tad more drama hahah ,i atleast wanted to see the main character get a kiss from a girl or atleast to start dating one of the two girls who he hangs out with all the time.  The entire time i was watching this anime i couldn't help but wonder which of the two girls the main character was going to fall in love with, or atleast kiss or date, but it never happened even though both girls had feelings for the boy. This show lacks a second season, im sure all the viewers wanted to see one of the girls fall in love with the boy and a romance scene but it never occured, and im not sure if the main character was gay or not the producers didn't do a good job portraying if he was gay or straight. Also this show is in Japanese with English subtitles only, u cant change the language to English so that was a bit disappointing. This anime is really good and i see it as one of my favorites of all time, i just didn't like the way the producers kind of left the audience hanging with the lack of a romantic scene involving the main character and not giving its viewers a 2nd season.",1455753600,2,1350,4.113636363636363
