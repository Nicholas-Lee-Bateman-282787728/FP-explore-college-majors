8290149,5,B001CW800C,"Another episode from the NFL Channel's ""America's Game: the Superbowl Champions"" series, this one focusing on the 1992 Dallas Cowboys, traces the story of the team through the entire season as told by the players and coaches themselves.

The story of the 1992 Dallas Cowboys is told by Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Ken Norton and begins with the backstory of the change in ownership and coaching when Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys. Inheriting a team of old veterans past their prime and untalented young players, Jimmy Johnson essentially gutted the team and built through the draft. Jimmy Johnson, who was an excellent evaluator of talent, used the Herschel Walker trade to build the team from the ground up.

This is not a highlight film. It is the story of men in a competitive endeavor who rise to the occasion or, as the case may be, are driven by others to perform. Aikman and Irvin are able to open the window into the hard work and commitment required to become a champion. Ken Norton offers the perspective from the defensive side which boasted the top-ranked defense in the NFL and yet had not a single player as an All-Pro.

This DVD shows what it required to bring the Dallas Cowboys back to Superbowl form. The ""Triplets"" shined on offense behind a powerful offensive line and the defense had the power to shut people down. The DVD shows the road taken by Coach Jimmy Johnson to bring a team from the depths of a 1-15 season to the height of a championship in only a few years.

From the early games right through to their victory in the Superbowl against the Buffalo Bills, this is the story of the Dallas Cowboys. It's a good video that offers more than just a highlight reel and I recommend it with five stars.",1403740800,,1736,4.590322580645161
8290150,5,B001CW800C,"I ordered all three of the DVD's for the Cowboy's three Super Bowls.....XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX.  This is by far the best one of the three...the editing, the content, etc. all were just super and very entertaining.  Wish I could have been there.",1374710400,,244,4.651162790697675
8290151,4,B001CW800C,Entertaining and informative.  Not the entire game but having some highlights and insight into the team were well worth the asking price.,1361750400,,137,5.2272727272727275
8290152,5,B001CW800C,Christmas gift for husband...really enjoyed it. Will look into getting the other series for fathers day or for his birthday.,1357862400,,124,5.25
