7919612,2,B00003UC9Z,"In terms of ease to use and follow this tape is fantastic. The instructor is really easy to follow and doesn't go to quickly. Unfortunately, that's also the routines biggest flaw. This routine would be great for when you first wake up in the morning and are too groggy to jump right into a workout but the whole thing felt like a really dragged out warm up. There are definitely not enough exercises or repetitions to do very much good, especially not in the abs section. The upper body section was the most difficult but even that was pretty simple.",1208044800,,550,4.51
7919613,5,B00003UC9Z,"When I started exercising for the first time, the first 20 minute full body yoga/pilates workout changed my attitude towards working out.  It didn't hurt, I just felt better.  Taller and stronger in my back.  My vcr ate my vhs tape so I am finally looking for a replacement since I have been out of the fitness loop for a few years.  My thoughts on this workout is, if you are already in excellent shape it's not going to help lose weight. If you are out of shape or new to a ""stretching"" type workout it is a great beginning.  Honestly, I love all of the Method workouts.  When my boyfriend tried this style of working out he didn't think it was very hard or challenging until he corrected his form. You really have to concentrate on pulling your belly in, which they do an excellent job of reminding you of.  Eventually, you add this form to your everyday life and what a difference it made for me!  Now I have a different job and am looking forward to starting out all over again with this video.",1148774400,,999,4.304812834224599
7919614,1,B00003UC9Z,"This is so far removed from anything like true Pilates that I believe it should not be listed when ""Pilates"" is used to search for videos.  This is an American-style, Aerobic-type workout video which is fine if that's what you want.  The only relationship it has to Pilates is a few of the postures you hit for about 10 seconds each, but not in any way can you say that they are done the way that a trained Pilates instructor would do them. A grave disappointment!",995414400,5,464,4.383720930232558
7919615,2,B00003UC9Z,"Having used 'The Firm' tapes regularly for more than a year, I decided to give Pilates a try for a change in workout.  I tried this tape for the first time this morning and was for the most part, unsatisfied.  The way the instructor chants with the beat of the drums in the backround is thoroughly annoying, and the workout left no part of my body feeling...well...worked.  Maybe the focus on the upper body was OK, but I didn't have any trouble with the ab or total body sections.  It felt like a very long stretching session which should have lead to some hard work!
Maybe that's the point?  Am I missing something here?  Maybe I'll try some different tapes...I just don't see what's so fantastic about Pilates!",986774400,3,713,4.53125
7919616,5,B00003UC9Z,"Excellent combination of dance and pilates inspired exercises that  provides not only a very effective low impact workout but requires focus  and concentration that allows for mental stress relief as well.  I saw  results very quickly with this tape in the way of a more toned and flexible  body as well as eventually being able to complete the entire tape without  taking any rest stops (oh those burning abs and hamstrings).  Having taken  many modern dance classes as well as studying pilates, this tape seems to  capture both aspects quite well in a 60 minute format (three 20 minute  routines).  It provides a thorough full body workout that incorporates  stretching and strengthening at the same time thus eliminating the need for  additional ""warm up"" and ""cool down"" sections.  It is  the only exercise video I have ever purchased that has actually given me a  sense of accomplishment and that I look forward to using on a regular  basis.  I would highly recommend this tape for people who are looking for a  complete, effective, yet relaxing workout without any of the bone jarring,  high impact moves.",969148800,40,1111,4.902702702702703
