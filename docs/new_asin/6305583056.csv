1051991,3,6305583056,"I have always been a big fan of Jasmine Guy.  I wish she had more leading roles in movies since her TV days back in the 80's.

I bought this DVD and was pleasantly surprised.  If you are a guy who likes Jasmine Guy, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  I even bought a spare copy of this DVD.",1247356800,3,290,3.9482758620689653
1051992,2,6305583056,THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE $10 SAVE YOUR MONEY. JASMINE GUY TRIES BUT HER JAMAICAN ACCENT IS HORRIBLE,1241740800,,102,4.421052631578948
1051993,2,6305583056,"I wonder why they did not get a real Jamaican to play the lead Jamaican role. The fake accents just do not cut it. Otherwise, a fairly decent movie.",1195257600,2,148,4.137931034482759
1051994,3,6305583056,"Klash is a decent B-rated movie.

Positives..

1. Jasmine Guy!!  Tight outfits.  Nude scenes.  Need I say more.

2. The music is great w/ live performances by Shabba, Patra, Steel Pulse, etc.

3. Jasmine Guy!

4. Shot on location in Jamaica..very authentic.

5. Jasmine Guy!

Negatives..

1. Not enough of the live performances.

2. Bad video quality.

3. Cheesy special effects.

4. Snow was one of the live performers.

5. Simple, cliched plot, dialogue, and ending.",1153872000,4,468,4.973684210526316
1051995,3,6305583056,"This is an ok Jamaican movie. They could've done better finding someone to play Jasmine Guy's part, and who's bright idea was it to have Bob Marley's daughter play a cop? I wouldn't recommend buying this if you've never seen a Jamaican movie before!
Nuff respect...seen",1054166400,,269,4.869565217391305
1051996,4,6305583056,"I had seen a view of this video at the start of another video that I was going to view. However, I just like to know, why is this video so beyond the price of other vhs video's?
That is my on bigest question that I am in wonder about.
Please let me know of this question.  Thanks",1050451200,,279,3.810344827586207
1051997,3,6305583056,"Kla$h was alright...nothing special. Jasmine Guy is worthless and her Jamaican accent is laughable. Cedella Marley has a small part as a cop...bet Bob is rolling over in his grave with his daughter portraying Babylon. The reliable Carl Bradshaw is the best thing about this movie..is there any Jamaican movie that he ISN't in?!? I was especially turned off when the movie featured Snow, the Canadian dancehall wannabe responsible for ""Informer"", instead of showcasing more of Jamaica's more talented acts.",1042761600,6,505,5.325
1051998,3,6305583056,This is just an awful movie to watch. Jasmine Guy as a Jamaican is about as convincing as Bob Marley as Ronald Reagan. Just horrible I don't know what they were thinking.,984873600,4,170,4.34375
