423842,5,6302091632,"Yes, the violence is a bit extreme, kind of like RoadRunner & Coyote brought to life, yet somehow Pesci & Stern make it OK to laugh at their foibles.  Masterfully crafted by the great John Hughes, this film still  stands as the number one all-time box office comedy.  But, what really  makes this film is the Score.  Another triumph for John Williams.  I highly  recommend adding this film and the soundtrack to your Xmas collection.",914976000,,433,4.693333333333333

425066,5,6302091632,"Somewhere in our collective memories resides this nearly-30-year-old  tale that launched a fair young  Macaulay Culkin as an otherwise helpless eight-year-old who faces a moment of truth when his home and life are imperiled.
 Under Chris Columbus' direction, John Hughes' production, and with  the help of John Williams' gentle and appropriate scoring to set the mood,we are introduced to the large,boisterous, and chaotic McCallister household in a snow-laden Illinois suburb as the family are preparing for a Christmas vacation in Paris. The youngest child, Kevin(Culkin) is at odds with his older siblings because he can't do anything for himself, including pack his suitcase.
  In the midst of all the hullabaloo, a ""policeman"" visits the house to inquire about where the family are going and about their security measures.
 But as we shall see, this so-called  police officer is really a crook named Harry(Joe Pesci), whom, along with his accomplice, Marv(Daniel Stern), are casing the neighborhood for houses to rob while the McAllisters, like many of their neighbors, are away for the holidays.
 A quarrel with his oafish big brother, Buzz(Devin Ratray) results in Kevin being sent to the isolation room on the third floor of the house.
 A power outtage resulting from a snowstorm results in the failure of the alarm clocks to sound on time, resulting in everyone waking up late, and having to hustle to get to the airport on time. The arrival of an obnoxious kid from across the street who interrogates the airport transporation drivers will further complicate things.
 Kevin wakes up in his isolation room, and discovers that his wish for his family to disappear has been fulfilled. Initially, he rejoices at his new freedom, getting into all sorts of forbidden activities, but then taking on a little responsibility for household maintenence by walking to the store to buy a  few groceries. It is while he is out on the street , that he first encounters Harry and Marv in their van.
  While they are airborne and en route to Paris, Mrs. McAllister( Catherine O'Hara) finally realizes that she has forgotten her youngest, and while her husband(John Heard) takes his family to stay with a relative near the famed Iglese de Sacre Coeur, Kevin's mother returns home to be with him.
  At one point Kevin staves off the burglars by pretending their is a party in the house. One only wishes his family could see how his street smarts kick in at such a moment. In the meantime, in the Paris apartment, Buzz explains to his sister Megan(Hillary Wolf), why he doesn't regret Kevin's being left behind.
 An useasy encounter with the two thieves leads to Kevin's dodging them  by hiding behind a church Nativity scene before going in to attend the service, during which time he has a chat with his forboding neighbor, Mr. Marley (Roberts Blossom). The words of wisdom they exchange will be helpful to both of them.
 Having overheard the two crooks designating a time to return to his house for the heist, Kevin concocts a battle plan, to defend his home.
 With no flights going out until after Christmas, Mrs. McAllister accepts a ride home from Gus Polisnki(John Candy), a polka bandleader who travels around the Midwest  performing. When she tells him her story, he reassures her that she is not a bad parent.
 In that grand tradition of John Hughes films we see how a seemingly helpless child outwits his elders, and, with a little help from friends,including Buzz's pet tarantula, will subdue them, although in the eyes of his family, will still appear to be a troublemaker.
 Feel free to share this funny and poignant story, and all its magic and  all of its memories with all of your family!",1513641600,,3695,4.903536977491961

Miracle on 34th St., that one Jimmy Stewart movie, etc. The Home Alone movies are mine. The first two not the other dozen or so. Those don't count. Just like all the movies after the first 2 The Land Before Time don't count. If you disagree I will fight you. This review probably isn't helpful to someone who has never seen the movie before and is looking to maybe rent or buy it.

The only thing he has to watch out for is the mysterious neighbor (Roberts Blossom) that seems to be eyeing him. Yeah right. The fun thing about Christmas is it attracts wet bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.)

Now the contest begins between the bandits (in Wile E. Coyote style) are wanting in the house and Kevin (in the Road Runner style) holding them off.

425369,5,6302091632,Home Alone is one of my favorite movies ever. I remember seeing it for the first time in 2006 when I used to have it on VHS but now on DVD in a family fun edition DVD. I would definitely prefer the original over the other ones. The first is the most popular one in the entire movie series. Everybody loves the original home alone movie. For the second movie some people say they really do enjoy the second one but even though it's not really as great and popular like the first one is. As far as for the third home alone a lot of people hate home alone 3. The first is definitely the best. I would have to say I would definitely put the original home alone at my number 1 for favorite and home alone 2 lost in New York at my number 2 for least favorite.,1497484800,,753,3.993377483443709

425393,3,6302091632,Macaulay Culkin is absolutely great in this.  He plays a kid who kind of gets a bad rap at Christmas when all of his relatives are over.  And he gets sent up to the attic for the night.  The next day everyone oversleeps.  They are going on a trip and in their rushing around forget and leave him at home.  He wakes up to find himself all alone in their big empty house.  And starts eating junk food and pizza.  Because it seems like everyone in the neighborhood is gone.  Two burglars are breaking in to everybody's houses.  He decides to defend his house.  With everything from jacks to blow torches.  It turns into a sort of Wiley Coyote/Roadrunner.  Sadly Macauley Culkin peaked in this.,1494374400,,690,4.432

However, you would think that a very upper-middle-class family like the McCallisters would have a cell phone in the house, even if it were a brick. ""Hi honey? It's mom. I'm coming back to get you, but I need you to walk down to the local police station and wait there until I come back. What? Yes. I'm sure they'll have doughnuts.""

It's been said before & I'll repeat it here - nobody screams like Daniel Stern.  The scene where Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) places the tarantula on Marv's (Stern) face is priceless & she rewinds & rewinds & never stops laughing. A good one for the collection - and if I can get away with the cliche - it never gets old.,1485129600,,457,3.913978494623656

-no skips
-good picture quality
-doesn't freeze if you leave DVD on pause or standby after watching DVD and walking away for a bit

Cons:
-The only con is that the DVD didn't contain the extras and behind the scenes shoots that are always enjoyable to watch. Considering the price for this DVD though, I still think you get your dollars worth.

Overall: I would recommend this product if you're looking for a great Christmas classic that the whole family can enjoy. The price is great for what you get.",1485043200,,637,4.474137931034483

427253,5,6302091632,"A Christmas Classic and great fun for the whole family! I digitally rented this so my kids (10, 7, and 6) could watch this for the first time with us as a family. I can't remember the last time they laughed so hard, and there were plenty of joyful tears at the end. This is one of those movies that will stand the test of time.
The PG rating is well-deserved. There are a few instances of some mildly harsh language and imagery that would not be appropriate for young children (<10) to view without an adult there to explain some things. The first 10 minutes of the film is much more unsettling than funny. It's also important to remind them that, even though this is a live-action film, the interactions between Kevin and the ""Wet Bandits"" are not very realistic and that there would be some very real dangers involved in trying to imitate Kevin's actions.
Otherwise, this is a great family film and perfect for enjoying around Christmastime. There is a reason this was a box-office blockbuster when it was in theaters. It's one every kid in North America should see at some point in their life.",1482710400,,1096,4.5125628140703515

The characters are foul mouthed and rude, the scenes are utterly ridiculous and somehow and 8 year old is able to outsmart an entire village including the two burglars trying to rob his house.  In the process he practically destroys their home and yet in the very next scene when mom returns the house is utterly pristine!  Nonsense.

428963,5,6302091632,"Here is my review: If you need a review to help you decide if you should get or watch this movie, DON'T BOTHER. This movie is so ubiquitous, so enmeshed in pop culture, that I fear a review would only harm here. This is not a movie one watches for the craft of the film (though I propose there is plenty of that) or for some master class acting (though, bless Catherine O'Hara, who's got the acting midas touch). Rather, it is watched for nostalgic connection to time and place, to memories, to popularized sayings and quotes. I know the fact that I wrote all this defeats my premise. But hey, if you don't like it? ""Keep the change, ya filthy animal!""",1481241600,,652,4.352459016393443

430116,5,6302091632,"It was my favorite movie as a kid, it featured my very first crush, and while there have been many copycats, there will only ever be one Home Alone. I highly doubt that anyone reading a movie review blog hasn't seen this film by now, but those select few...The film centers on Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) a bratty kid, whose extended family is preparing for Christmas in Paris. During dinner, Kevin starts a fight with his older brother, Buzz, and is sent to sleep alone in the attic. An overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and Kevin gets left home alone. At the same time, a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house. Kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it. As his parents rush to get back to him, Kevin prepares for war! Home Alone is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be. These films all claim to be fun for the whole family, but lets face it, they're geared toward children. Most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in you're on your phone or falling asleep, but not here. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Macaulay Culkin is fantastic. We all know Pesci for his mobster roles, so it's easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor, and it is actually what he does best. Paired with a great cast, a legendary director, and a terrific story, this is simply the best family feature film I have ever seen. Home Alone has something for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry, and beg for more, and that's why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film, but as I said earlier there will only ever be one Home Alone and it is an absolute must see movie!",1468454400,,1815,4.294460641399417

430210,5,6302091632,"I loved this movie as a child and perhaps even more as an adult. It is possibly the best Christmas movie around. As a boy this movie was hilarious and thrilling and inspired fantasies of myself one day thwarting a home invasion from adult N'ere Dowells. As an adult this movie was still funny and thrilling but also had me weeping at numerous points throughout the film. It reminded me so much of how I had once seen the world through the eyes of a child, and how much valuable innocence had been lost over the years. The family and Christmas themed scenes were especially emotional for me, because growing up has since caused me to lose faith in my religion, in my parents and the goodness of humanity. I was reminded of the important and valuable memories I had from Christmas and time spent with family. The memories I blocked out from when I was a young child and before my family fell apart. This movie made me realize how much has been stolen from me in growing up with my parents' divorce in middle school, and watching my family slowly drift apart. I wish I could be a young child again at Kevin McCallister's age, and watching this movie gave me a piece of my childhood back. The sequel is also very much worth watching and holds the same emotions.",1465344000,,1257,4.422413793103448

431453,5,6302091632,"I rented this movie for my young grandchildren.  I have seen the movie a couple of times and wanted to see their reaction to it.  I find this story really funny and rather endearing!  Macaulay Culkin is inadvertently left behind in his upscale neighborhood when his family leaves to go on a Christmas vacation overseas...someone messed up the head count of the many, many relatives staying at his house.  The night before, this young character is sent to sleep up in the room in the attic as a form of punishment for something he did.  In the morning, everyone is in a hurry and forgets him.  This is a kid who really didn't have many responsibilities before, but being on his own he learns to shop for groceries, set up a Christmas tree, and pretty much just take care of himself.  A robber, disguised as a policeman, cases out the house and returns when he believes the house is empty.  Let's just say they don't have an easy time of it due to the kid who was left Home Alone!  It's a hilarious adventure for children and adults alike!",1453766400,,1037,4.444444444444445

431820,4,6302091632,"For anyone who grew up in the 90's, this is a humorous and nostalgic film. It is the first in a series of ""Home Alone"" films. With family woes, Kevin (Culkin) wishes his family away, and it becomes true for a time. This film is not only funny for adults, but albeit Bart Simpson-esque, there is a good message about family commitment and values.
In a nutshell, this film is fairly versatile and switches gears fairly often. The comedic look at a child's life without parents and rules, contrasts the emotional (and on occasion awkward) familial subplots.
That being said I wouldn't plop just any old kid in front of this film.  So I completely agree with it's PG rating.",1453075200,,670,4.583333333333333

It's a classic tale from the 1980's of a busy family going on a big multi-family trip but they manage to leave behind one child, Kevin. He ends up home alone and actually having to fight off some burglars! The kids will love the slap stick comedy, Kevin's adventures as he shops, cooks, goes to church and defends his house using toys and various contraptions. Older kids will appreciate the story line of the seemingly spooky older neighbor. I didn't remember it as being as charming as it was!

How is it that you release a DVD in 2015 and not know how to package the movie in the format it was intended to be played in? Besides that the picture quality was sub standard and it was the first DVD in a long time that we watch in Stereo (for you kids playing at home, that's the minimal audio separation we watched most of our content with in the early 90's, but better movie studios have since banished it from the vast majority of DVD conversions).

432548,5,6302091632,"I've been watching this movie with my brother since I was 4 years old when the movie came out on VHS. I can't believe we didn't wear out the tape!

Some have commented on bad language. I don't remember any really bad words being said in the movie (no s-word or f-word), and I watched it from such a young age. I think the worst part is when Buzz says the a** word when they're talking in his room, but it's not a big deal. I think Ferris Bueller's Day Off has more offensive language!

This movie is a Christmas classic.",1448841600,,520,4.138613861386139

On the box it says ""Digital HD"" - what a an inaccurate description. I wish I had spent more and bought the Blu-Ray. I typically do not need an old movie like this to be Blu-Ray since the appeal of the movie is the story and not the filmography, but the picture was so bad I couldn't even focus on enjoying it.",1448841600,,440,4.188235294117647

432623,2,6302091632,"This is a decent set, the problem is if you are buying this for the movie's themselves. The movies come housed in these cardboard sleeves, anyone that has been collecting DVD's or Blu Ray's for any length of time knows that this type of packaging cannot support discs very well. Upon inspection of the disc's themselves I noticed several scratches on each disc besides the Blu Ray's (keep in mind there are 2 Blu Ray's in this set as well as 5 DVD's). The additional swag that comes with the set is the paint can, Christmas ornament with Kevin's face on it, a cheap looking plastic spider, and the wanted posted for Harry and Marv as well as Kevin's battle plan. I had ordered this the other day for $27.99, was it worth it? At that price it made me take a gamble, but it is definitely going back as I can't live with scratches on discs and take the risk of more scratches developing each time I take the disc out. So in summation, overall I would not recommend this set.",1448409600,116,971,4.34065934065934

433003,4,6302091632,"If you followed pop culture at all in 1990, it was impossible to miss the phenomenon that was Home Alone.  Everyone was talking about it and clips were everywhere.  I didn't go to the movies much back then, so I missed it at that time, and Id never gotten around to watching it.  I finally decided to fix that this year, and I can see why the film was so popular back then and many people still love it today.

The McCallister family is heading to France for Christmas.  The day before they are set to leave, everyone arrives to stay with Kevins family outside of Chicago.  Between his siblings and his cousins and the adults, there is a house full.  And everyone is dumping on poor 8-year-old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), the youngest of the family.  When he loses it, he is sent up to the attic for the night.

In the rush to leave the next morning, the family misses Kevin, and he wakes up to find out his wish to be alone has come true.  While his mother (Catherine OHara) frantically tries everything to get back to him, Kevin revels in his freedom.  That is, until he figures out that two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are planning to rob his house.  Can he stop them?

Ive got to say from the start that I was very impressed with this film.  It set things up so well that the premise and complications Kevins family faced along the way trying to get in touch with him were completely believable.  I was expecting to have to go along with the premise just as a set up to the film, but it actually worked and made sense.  Likewise, the now famous climax is set up well early on as we are told about some of Kevins earlier antics.

Likewise, there are some very good quiet, tender moments late in the film.  Nothing to make you cry, but definitely showing some character growth.  A sub-plot involving Kevins neighbor was great, although it did feel like it was in there for filler.

Of course, this is a comedy.  As it was billed at the time, this is a family comedy without the family.  While I don't know that I laughed outright at it, I certainly smiled at some of the things that happened.  This was especially true when Kevin was reveling in his freedom or later when he was trying to act like a grown up.  Even the scenes with the rest of his family were fun if not quite at the level of the scenes with Kevin on his own.

I do have two minor complaints with the film.  It starts out a little slowly, especially if you know what is going to happen.  Yes, they have to set things up, but it feels like they could have been a little quicker about it.

The other complaint is the battle.  While I know they were going for slapstick comedy, this one just seemed to venture on the side of painful instead of humorous to me.  Yes, some of it was pretty funny, but at the next moment Id cringe.  And, honestly, why didn't the burglars just leave?  If I were them, I would have.  Thats the only point where the premise of the movie falls apart.  Too bad, too, since theyd set the rest up so well.

The movie made a star out of Macaulay Culkin.  I felt he was a bit over the top early on, but as the movie went along, he really settled into the part and helped make Kevin believable.  Since so much of the film centers around him alone in the house, thats a very good thing.  He certainly made many of those scenes fun.  The rest of the cast was great, especially Catherine OHara, who was believably frantic in a way that was funny without ever going over the top.

While its easy to nitpick here or there, the overall movie is still quite entertaining.  While Home Alone might never be part of my Christmas staple movie list, Im glad I watched it and would certainly enjoy seeing it again.",1434844800,,3695,4.258992805755396

433640,5,6302091632,"The original ""Home Alone"" movie never fails to roll me off my seat laughing at the antics and gags all over again. Some of the punch lines may be dated, but John Hughes has created a timeless classic of eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) accidently left behind when his family and cousins go on a Christmas trip to Paris. The ""Wet Bandits"" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are the bungling burglars who try to invade the silver tuna, Kevin's home, for their pot of gold. But Kevin keeps them at bay with his home defense plans. And let's not forget John Williams' score that sets the mood and frames the plot.

(SPOILER ALERT) I am always touched by the closing scene when the ""Snow shovel assassin,"" the eccentric neighbor who Kevin befriends (or who befriends Kevin), reunites with his estranged son and family. Not a dry eye in the room.

A closing observation -- Isn't it funny that every movie featuring a lost tooth or filling has the finder always checking his own teeth? In this case, Kevin's dad (John Heard) fulfills the cliched role. But I'm still searching for ""Angels With Filthy Souls"" at my local Netflix. Keep the change ya filthy animal.

Also, in my humble opinion, John Candy should have a larger role than ""Polka King."" Overall, it was okay for a family movie, but not highly recommended.",1419811200,,386,4.661764705882353

He woke up to find his wish had come true.  A couple of thieves are up to no good and started messing with his neighborhood (See what I did there?) and Kevin defends his house from the bad guys with funny and clever antics that will make you laugh.  The movie also comes away with a couple of good messages- as Kevin learned to trust his neighbor he was afraid of from rumors around the neighborhood he was a murderer.  Kevin encouraged him to reach out to his estranged son after years of no contact and the family is seen getting together and spending their first Christmas in awhile together.

  we have not seen this movie for several years.  it always amazes us how funny it is.  the main character is a smart little boy with lots of stuff to ward off bumbling home invaders.  the cast is hilarious and the situations speak for themselves.  christmas time portrayed in the movie hits home to millions, but the movie just makes you laugh and enjoy the holiday season.  lighten up everyone, it is christmas...yrmv",1418515200,,426,4.675675675675675

434265,5,6302091632,"Truly one of the best Christmas movies, a classic with all the right things going for it -- great music, a good story and some really fine acting.  True, it is a bit heavy on the cartoon violence, (it is rated PG) but I think most kids watching it will know enough not to try such things on their friends (or enemies).  If you're looking for morally uplifting stories it does show human kindness, heroism and courage under fire, and justice handed out to a pair of thieves.  Overall it presents a well-rounded, sometimes rollicking tale, with a fair share of touching scenes that wear a very Christmassy face.
  It has long been one of the most popular Christmas movies.  The music, especially John Williams' score, is one of my favorite things, something that draws me in as soon as the movie begins.  And it has many short scenes that are always a pleasure to revisit -- I like the scene in the grocery store where he has to convince the clerk that he's not alone and the one in the church where he gives advice to the man who lives down the block.
  I also like the roles of Harry and Marv -- they do make very good baddies, and their part of the story is a key to making it all work.  I'm not the biggest fan of slapstick comedy and violence, but, at least in this one, I thought it wasn't too overdone and even rather creative how Kevin handled the two of them.
  I look forward to watching it every year and can't break the habit -- there are just too many good scenes, music, and beautiful scenery to be missed.",1418515200,,1518,4.287719298245614

This is the combination of the magic and hope of Christmas with it's dark/ghostly side. John Williams' score rules. It feels like that peak of pre-9/11 just post-80's US pop culture. Fusion of a lot of clever narrative elements, somewhat self-aware, but very much grounded in making cinema enjoyable and entertaining with fun gags and caricatures. And those classic shots of the wealthy Chicago suburbs lol, how many times do we see those in these kinds of films?

434459,5,6302091632,"What to say?  Its a classic comedy that my family loves!
I purchased this movie because my nephew planned to visit and he had not seen the movie before...its funny even to today's youth!  He laughed and laughed (age 11)...we all did.

An extended family is staying together before all heading out of the country for the winter holidays. Kevin (main character) is a young boy who doesn't quite fit into the mix: he's too young for this, too bratty for that, gets blamed for things...you know the scene.  So when they all leave, late of course, for the airport, he gets left behind.  He has a blast, until robbers case his house, then he takes a stand.  At about the same time, his family realizes they left him and try to get back-- at Christmas-- through snowy airports.  This also takes a side-journey that is hilarious.

It all works out in the end, and some lessons are learned by pretty much everybody in the film, so it should be fine for kids of all ages.  A truly funny film.  I wish there were more like it nowadays...now I'm showing my age-!",1415318400,,1050,4.421875

The injuries sustained by the burglars in this film would likely be fatal or, in some cases, cause critical injuries, and although I realize the  intention was slapstick-style visual humor, this type of thing could be confusing for young kids.

I remember it just being good old fashioned slapstick, but several times throughout the movie I was shocked at the word choice given I had a 5, 7 and 9 year old in the room. We're not prudes, but we also don't talk that way with each other - and expect our children won't either.  The Tom and Jerry slapstick parts are still hilarious, but if you are doing to have your younger kids watch - just be prepared for some phrases and word choice that might raise an eyebrow, yes, even in 2014.  It's all about the ages.  PG bordering on PG-13 perhaps....

It's just very funny as well as being allowing us to identify with a kid with a big family, a jerky older brother and getting in trouble for things we didn't do, and then having the fantasy of the place to ourselves. It really speaks to kids and the kid in all us grown ups too.

It's just as funny when it's not the Christmas season. Definitely one of my ""go to"" movies",1389571200,,426,4.059523809523809

435361,5,6302091632,"Our kids love this movie. They do a great job setting up the story in such a way that one can believe that the kid could have been left behind (his boarding pass and passport ended up in the trash by accident; the kid was sleeping in the attic because the house was full of family members; chaos at all times).
Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious. My kids laugh out loud through all the traps Macalay's character makes these two go through. Fun movie with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end. Great for the holidays. We watch it every year as a family tradition.",1388534400,,563,4.271028037383178

435364,4,6302091632,"Before I saw it, I heard a lot of opinions from people about it: some said that it was a fun, family move when others said it was filled with rude remarks and some not-so-nice stuff that is impressionable on younger viewers. On Christmas Eve, me and my family bough it to watch that night. I sat down and watched it, and in the end...It was (or, it is) a pretty fun movie! Most family-oriented films seem to follow a pattern, but this one, well, we can say its a rebel to the normal family-movie stereotype. Its just one of those films that you just want to sit down and watch, if you know what I mean. The acting is pretty good, especially that on the main character, Kevin. Its just at the very beginning that the acting is very ""noticeable"": it seems like everybody in the McAlister household is treating Kevin very badly, and its sort of ""painfully"" obvious that their treating him like that on purpose. But besides that, the acting is outstanding! The plot is just plain awesome, and the action in it (especially  towards the end) is probably the best that you'll ever see from a movie like Home Alone. There are a few remarks that are really not polite or good, but will probably fly right over the heads of most children. Though it might not be a very ""moralized"" story, there are some scenes in it that will probably get you thinking. There's never a dull moment in it, so you'll never get bored with it.
Here's the finale prediction that probably sizes the movie up: there may be a few crude remarks, but everything else is completely family-friendly and just plain fun to watch. I know that pretty much everybody has seen this movie, so you can hold whatever opinion that you want. But for me, this is defiantly one of the best family classics of all time.",1388448000,2,1766,4.4338461538461535

We all know the movie so I will not review its good and bad parts, but can not stand to watch it on TV. Commercials make me do weird things like eat my hands while singing opera. Nope, it is worth the little bit of money to see it straight through without commercial interruptions.

a family, especially a pre-teen boy, & his coping alone for a
couple of days.

It is a great holiday story that shows a family's love and concern for one of its most annoying members who becomes left behind during a Christmas vacation. His ability to fend for himself and improvise to ward off a couple of robbers is the premise on which the story is built.

435847,5,6302091632,"Home Alone, a holiday classic in its own right is perfect to watch as a double feature with its first sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. A note on the Amazon review though, Macaulay Culkin's character Kevin does not ever meet John Candy and Billie Bird. His mother Kate (Catherine O'Hara, also creating a memorable performance) interacts with those characters in her attempt to get back home to Kevin. John Candy and Catherine O'Hara are great together in their scenes. Mac does meet his next door neighbor (played by Roberts Blossom) and has a touching scene in the church with him later on. With any John Hughes film, Home Alone has a lot of heart and meaning in the midst of all the crazy mishaps and booby traps. They don't make 'em like this anymore which makes it all the more special. Also recommended, Scrooged with Bill Murray.",1381104000,,840,4.6066666666666665

But the kid is fun, funny, smart and resourceful. Much to the disappointment of two would-be thieves. The clever stuff he does is a little farfetched to say the least but still believable (?).

this time as 25th Anniversary edition which i am sad to say
is a reissue of the Family fun edition Blu-ray from 2009
absolutely nothing is Different, no new HD transfer, no new extras
it's a recycle of the Family fun edition blu-ray
the special features on this new 25th anniversary is exactly the same as the 2009 Blu-ray edition
there are no new extras at all
the only Difference is the packaging and the cover art that is it.
if you already own the Family fun edition like i Do, it's waste of money buying the new 25th anniversary
your just Double dipping
obviously a lot of stupid decisions are made at 20th century fox with these new Blu-ray reissues
unless new special features are added or new HD transfer etc it's a waste of money for sure

436082,2,6302091632,"I believe I'm one of the last people in the world to see this film for the very first time, but never in my life has Chris Columbus's Home Alone struck me as interesting. Oh yes, it does have an interesting concept: being left home alone for an extended period of time is a scary notion. But the film suffers from laziness by a once great screenwriter in John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and a thoughtful premise tossed aside for an insufferable protagonist and awful slapstick.

When it was first released, Home Alone made half of a billion dollars worldwide at the box office, second place behind Ghost. Critics were divided on it, but since its 1990 release, it's gone on to be a loved family film that makes you laugh and warms your heart. For myself, it did neither. Some of Hughes' earlier films, most notably Ferris Bueller, did make me laugh, and they were very enjoyable. This time, an idiotic script ruins an interesting setup.

We are introduced to our hero, 8-year old Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin), as he and his family are preparing for a Christmas trip in France. While everybody else is getting ready, Kevin is begging for attention because he doesn't know how to pack a suitcase. But instead of helping him, the rest of the family shuns him. This may seem cold, but I didn't care one bit because Kevin is just about one of the smuggest, conceited little brats I've ever seen in a film. And since he's just so much of a jerk (which his uncle calls him out on), he deserves to get yelled at.

Kevin is my biggest problem with the film, and it goes a long way: a little rambunctiousness is fine. Kids are stubborn and adventurous, and impatience is most certainly expected out of them. But Kevin, for however much Culkin tries (he's not an appealing presence in the first place), is still an pigheaded little imp whose tedious adventure does not spark my interest or delight in the very least.

His family leaves him behind in confusion when the power goes out on them and they just barely make the plane. At this, two bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) break into the house and try to steal all of the beloved possessions as they did with a few other houses. But Kevin is ready to stop them with booby traps that act as the slapstick, but just come off as cruel ploy.

Pesci is at his very best when he is screaming, cursing, and about ready to blow up in somebody's face. He would win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, which came out the same year as Home Alone. Of course, Chris Columbus is no Martin Scorsese. And this film does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas; but it must serve as a comparison for the two Pesci performances, and frankly, his home robber sucks. Especially when compared to his gangster.

Stern directed a cute baseball film called Rookie of the Year in 1993, where he also played a confused yet very funny pitching coach. He also does not show off his talent here, and has been much better elsewhere. He and Pesci are the poor victims of not only terrible screenwriting, but also awful slapstick. The traps that Kevin sets for the robbers look as if designed to kill them, not to catch them. But Columbus turns the film into a cartoon by showing that smashing your head on the floor is humorous. Instead of being threatened with a gun (belonging to Kevin's brother Buzz), Pesci and Stern are the objects of cartoon violence in real life. It is not realistic, and therefore not funny.

Besides its jerk hero and forgettable supporting cast, the film suffers from far too many moments of sentimentality. This is a film where Kevin learns finally to stop being a jerk, think for himself, and begin to take some responsibility. But at no point in Home Alone do I begin to even care about the kid or anything that happens to him; and I could really care less when he apologizes to his family and warms everybody's hearts. Columbus and Hughes pull at our heartstrings in a way that makes Disney's Pinocchio look like Hitchcock's Psycho.

Sentimentality at times is tolerable, but when a protagonist is a hotheaded little lump, there needs to be something that makes us care about the characters or plot. But the filmmakers really don't know what that is, and therefore can't do anything better than to say, ""We forgive you, Kevin. You're the brightest star in our sky.""

On a more positive note: one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams, and the film contains his best work of the 1990s outside of Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. It improves the film, but sadly, not by much.

There is some creativity to the film and begs the question: what it is like to be home alone for an extended period of time? Well in real life, I don't think it would look anything like this. The violence is too cartoony and unfunny, and Kevin is such an obstinate, unappealing little jerk whose actions are of no interest or consideration to me. What's most depressing however was that it was enormously successful, more than enough to warrant a sequel, a film I actually saw before this one. And it is of equal evil and triteness.

During his time alone a local crime duo are robbing all of the houses in the neighborhood while the families are away on vacation, including Kevin's home, which they believe is empty.  In a tale of growing up and the importance of family, Kevin defends his home against these criminals is the only way a child from the 90's could...in hilarious fashion.

This is a great family movie for the holidays and the Blu-ray conversion looks and sounds great.  It's a welcome addition to any Christmas/holiday movie collection and a must have for anyone who was a kid in the 90's.",1361404800,,948,4.57396449704142

We chose to watch it because we both had just watched (for free) ""Home Alone 3""---which I thought would surely be total junk. The odd thing is---we both really liked the ""third installment."" It was ridiculous---hilariously ridiculous. We both howled with laughter. It's a ""total cartoon."" Now---you may dismiss my review, but I am here to tell you that my 6 year old felt the same way. He LOVED ""Home Alone 3,"" but ""Home Alone,"" downloaded for $3.99, was ho-hum in contrast. The movie always aggravated me with its gratuitous ""Ahhhhhhhh"" from Culkin, but its biggest offense is that it tries to be a cartoon and real movie at the same time. I'm sorry, but I feel one has to choose sides. Clearly, we preferred the slapstick nonsense of the third movie to the overall ""important"" nonsense of the first one.",1358812800,3,893,4.5875

At first, he loves the freedom of not having his family around as he experiences many fun adventures by himself but as time passes, he realizes how much they all mean to him even though they have their differences.

It gets to be tense without being scary enough to truly scare little ones watching it.  Funny enough for kids and adults to laugh at, and generally entertains for the vast majority of the time (some may feel the setup is a bit much, but it really is important to set the tone).

Arguably the best in the series, its as the tagline says ""A family comedy without the family"". It would help to have somewhat of a sense of humor when viewing. What is this film about? In short, the family leaves to go on Christmas vacation, the kid gets left at home alone and eventually has to defend his house and himself from the ""bad guys""(played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern-the funniest and best ""bad guys"" in a movie). All the while, the kid""s (Kevin McCallister played by Macaulay Culkin) parents are trying to get home to him. The movie has a happy and very touching ending and an incredible score.

That said, be careful which copy you purchase and made sure you know the return policy (and make sure it's a good one). The copy I purchased came sealed and wrapped, and everything about it seemed brand new. But the DVD video plays like it's a mediocre pirated recording. Small screen - not a full or a widescreen - and really grainy picture. The audio isn't great either, it's scratchy at times. Very limited DVD menu, too. About the only good thing about the DVD is that there are no previews to sift through - more evidence that maybe this isn't an authorized reproduction.

For now, this will work for my purposes. Maybe later when the next movie-viewing medium comes out I'll upgrade and be more careful about the copy I buy. For those shopping: like I said, make sure you know the return policy before you buy, and if it's a gift order well before Christmas so you have time to check it out.

Also I bought directly from Amazon (weird that they sell such a crummy DVD recording), and you can't beat the shipping and prices at the holidays.

Yes, it's unlikely that both Mom and Dad will lose ""KEVIN!,"" but given the crunch to get the family to the airport and onboard the flight to Paris, we accept that it's possible. John Hughes creates some fun high jinx between Keviin and the adult world, especially the two would-be burglars. But the cartoonish collissions are effectively contrasted to the unexpected rescue and insight that Kevin receives from his ""monstrous"" neighbor. Lessons abound in this funny Chrstmas tale, less cloying than some of our other classics.

Everything happens to work out in order for them to accidentally leave their youngest child at home.  The electricity goes out, making them in a rush, the neighbor's little boy comes over to talk (asking the van drivers 50 million annoying questions) and they end up counting him and therefore assume that the whole family is there.  Kevin, the 8 year old is left alone to fend for himself.  To complicate matters two criminals are looking to break into his house.  The movie is funny as heck as an 8-year-old tries to outwit 2 adult criminals.  One of the most hilarious moments is when Kevin orders some pizza and uses a VHR video to scare the living tar out of the pizza driver.  Not only is the movie funny but also it shows how people can take their family for granted.  After a little while of being alone, Kevin regrets his wish that his family would disappear and his mother does everything, including riding in a truck with a bunch of jazz musicians to get home.

436871,3,6302091632,"Since it's Christmas time, I think it's appropriate to review one of the most well-known staples in Christmas films, Home Alone.  I loved this movie when I first saw it back in the very early 90's, and throughout my childhood, I related to Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) really well, being a ""little brother"" myself (and that at the time, I loved cheese pizza, just like Kevin). However, when my teenage and adult years came around, it was time to get more critical since logical thinking became more dominant in my mind.

 STORY

 The McCallister family is getting ready to fly from their Chicago home to Paris before Christmas.  The night before the family leaves, Kevin gets into a fight over pizza with his older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray).  Kevin gets punished for instigating the fight and causing a big mess, and in a fit of anger, wishes that his family would disappear.  After the power gets knocked out that night, the family is running late for their flight and forget about Kevin in the rush.  All the while, a pair of burglars, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), known as the Wet Bandits, have their eyes set on robbing Kevin's house.

 CHARACTERS

 While not perfect, I thought the characters were well done in this movie.  While I'm not really a fan of Macaulay Culkin, I thought he was good as Kevin in this movie. Kevin is a believable kid, since he generally hits the ""right spot"" in between overly likeable and being an annoying little brat.  He's generally a good but misunderstood kid, but can show signs of selfishness.

 John Heard and Catherine O'Hara are good as Kevin's parents, Peter and Kate.  They're shown as parents who seem to be a little cold towards Kevin, but deep down, they really do love and care about him.

 The supporting cast was decent as Kevin's other family, and it's funny to think that Michael C. Maronna played one of Kevin's family members (Maronna would later become Big Pete in the classic Nickelodeon show The Adventures of Pete & Pete).  Roberts Blossom is great as Marley Murphy, a man misunderstood as a bad guy, but turns out to be a good person.

 Pesci and Stern are quite good as Harry and Marv.  Unlike a lot of family comedies revolving around a kid outsmarting the bad guys, Marv and Harry are actually pretty convincing as burglars.  They show to be menacing and believable in how they act before their ""showdown"" with Kevin.  Despite being victims to Kevin's creative traps, they're shown to be a little smart and ruthless at times, and these don't feel forced.

 HUMOR

 The humor in this movie is quite solid. Of course, the funniest parts of this movie are when Marv and Harry try to break into Kevin's house, unsuspecting of Kevin's traps.  Some of the funniest moments in this phase of the movie are when Marv accidentally steps on a bunch of Christmas ornaments with his bare feet, when he accidentally steps on a nail with bare feet, and when Kevin puts a tarantula on Marv's face, causing him to scream like a little girl.

 Even before the phase of the movie where Kevin faces off against Marv and Harry, there's still some good humor to be found.  Some examples are of the scenes where Kevin puts aftershave on his face, causing him to scream and when he goes to see a local Santa Clause, and you see this Santa smoking and ranting about getting a parking ticket.

 LOGICAL FLAWS

 I would have given this movie at least a percentage in the 70's, but after analyzing some of the logical fallacies in this movie, I had to bring the rating down a notch in order to give all of you a more fair and balanced review.

 Some of the biggest logical flaws in this movie are when Kevin pranks the pizza guy into thinking someone is shooting at him and the other is when he sets up the traps in his house.  The former in that it's pretty odd that the pizza guy didn't call the cops after the incident, though he might have been really scared to report it to anyone.  The other in that Kevin sets up some pretty messy traps in the house, such as the tar-lined staircase in the basement.  Did Kevin even think of how he could clean that up?

 CINEMATOGRAPHY

 The cinematography in this movie is splendid.  Julio Macat captures lots of great imagery of winter suburban Chicago and even of Paris in some scenes.  For a family-oriented Christmas film, these clean, pristine images are perfect.

 SOUNDTRACK

 John Williams's music for Home Alone is very good.  Many of the instrumental compositions in this movie are almost Christmas time staples nowadays, and they stir up all the right emotions.

 The choice of more ""traditional"" Christmas tunes wasn't bad, either.  They sound good and fit the movie like a glove.  I'm glad the Chipmunk Song wasn't used in this movie, as I HATE that song (though that's a different kettle of fish).

 FINAL WORD

 This is easily the best Home Alone movie in the whole series.  While not mandatory viewing, Home Alone is a pleasant Christmas family film, and essentially John Hughes's last good contribution to cinema.",1356307200,,5030,4.626274065685164

As an adult, I have a tendency to pick at the plot holes a little bit (I wonder why he didn't just call the police at the first sign of trouble instead of waiting until they had already broken in), but who cares?

I am always sensitive to what I think is proper for my grandchildren to see.  The reason I have reduced my rating one star is what I consider an excessive amount of vulgar language for young children,  But overall, the film is extremely funny and the related episode of the neighbor and his estranged son adds greatly to its content.  I might have wished that young Kevin would not have been so out of control in the beginning, but I suppose it is a sad commentary on modern family life.",1355875200,,640,4.221311475409836

My kids had recently seen ""Home Alone 3"" and we got them this to compare - they far preferred #1. Some of his more introspective and ""wise-beyond-his-years"" lines come out as stilted, but he's also supposed to be eight years old, so it's easy to absolve. The slapstick scenes of Joe Pesce and Daniel Stern attempting to break in are what it's all about.

437390,3,6302091632,"The climax of this movie, in which an eight-year-old boy booby-traps his house to prevent two burglars from robbing it while his family is away on Christmas vacation, is quite entertaining. He uses ice, tar, fire and whatever else he can find in the house to make even something as simple as walking up the stairs or turning a doorknob a dangerous experience for would-be-robbers.

In a more serious movie; one that doesn't sugarcoat its violence in slapstick comedy; the two burglars, named The Wet Bandits because one of them likes to clog the sink and leave the water running when they rob a house, would probably be dead. Here, they just hurt and humiliate themselves in amusing ways. There's a scene involving a spider that's actually laugh-out-loud hilarious.

What's annoying is the boy, Kevin. I guess he's supposed to be cute, and he might look cute, but the way he acts; the character and the actor who plays him; is the worst thing about the movie. When a Wet Bandit falls victim to one of his pranks, he celebrates with a ""Yes!"" When he glides across a sheet of ice to escape a policeman, he lets out an exaggerated ""Wooah!"" It's just annoying.

With that, I think Home Alone would be better if Kevin's character were presented in a more realistic way. I'd also like to see some background to how he's able to come-up with such an ingenius Battle Plan. There are no scenes of him making booby traps before his family mistakenly leaves him home alone; an inclusion that would work wonders for the plot's believability factor.

It all begins when Kevin's family accidentally leaves him at the house in the midst of a chaotic morning as his large family and their relatives head to the airport for Paris, France. Kevin realizes he is home alone and panics at first, but then parties as he pleases in the absence of his parents and bossy siblings.

The youngster's holiday from his family changes gears, from doing the laundry and eating all the ice cream he wants, to planning mischievous pranks when the two thieves show up at his address. With creative ingenuity, Kevin manages to teach them a lesson they won't forget. He also gets a little help from a new friend.

The movie is humorous and also touches on the importance of family. During Kevin's holiday, he gets acquainted with an older man in his neighborhood who has also experienced difficulties with his own family.

 The plot is pretty simple in that a family leaves behind their eight year old son when they fly to Paris for Christmas vacation. At home the little boy discovers two evil robbers are intent in stealing valuables from the house so he sets up a series of booby traps. The movie is both funny and heart warming and everyone, not just children, should watch it.

437564,4,6302091632,"To the delight of little children everywhere, a film like `Home Alone' really never goes out of style.  Sure, the subsequent sequels pale in comparison and tend to overstay their welcome a bit, and yes that same overuse can ware on the integrity and adoration of the original, but when the dust settles and the smoke clears there are still bountiful smiles to be found in a group of people watching this film.  As some have mentioned, it can get over the top, but isn't that what we are paying for here.

How else would an eight-year-old boy get one-up on two dim-witted thieves if it wasn't `over the top'!

The film tells the story of underappreciated Kevin McCallister.  Brother to four siblings who pick on him and son to two parents who are apparently distracted by life in general, Kevin has had it.  He just wants to be alone.  In preparing for a family vacation in Paris, the McCallister house is bombarded by family and countless other little rug rats who clutter every crevice of the house making it pretty easy to lose track of who is who and who is where; which is precisely why the McCallister family makes their way across the globe to Paris without young Kevin.  Fooled by his young mind into thinking that his family's disappearance was his fault, Kevin finds himself initially gleeful over his newfound freedom (a house all to himself), but soon he encounters two thieves who didn't count on Kevin's presence when they broke into the McCallister home.  The night gets interesting as Kevin fends for himself with witty and highly improbable tactics, while his parents lose their minds overseas to the point where his mother stops at nothing to get home.

Yes, there is much about `Home Alone' that is beyond ridiculous, but one thing that isn't ridiculous is Macaulay Culkin's performance.  For such a young boy, he slays this.  He's hilarious, totally three-dimensional (in a performance that could have become generically one-note) and truly believable, even when he's engaged in highly unbelievable activities.  He just oozes a charisma and charm that defies his age and creates a legendary character.  There are few actors who create such unforgettable screen images, but everyone (even people who haven't ever seen this film) will recognize that adorable little face pressed between two hands with that wide open scream.  Yes, Culkin is unforgettable.

So, at the end of the day, `Home Alone' is a lot of fun.  At times it is cheap fun, and if we're going to be completely honest it is Culkin who really remains the most endearing and memorable facet of this film (if his performance had not been genius then this film would not be a landmark) but none of that matters with a film so rich with nostalgia.

437706,4,6302091632,"In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.

There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the McCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know. With the rest of the McCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.

But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.

Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.

Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.

There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life (which is very overrated and not really an Xmas movie at all), but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.

437707,5,6302091632,"""Home Alone"", first released in 1990, has endured as a funny, classic holiday movie.  It mixes some superb physical comedy with a wistful tale of a little boy who, for Christmas, just wants his family back.

As the story opens, the large McAllister family is packing out for a Christmas-time trip to Paris.  Somehow, eight year-old Kevin McAllister (Macauley Culkin) sleeps through the chaos of their departure and wakes up alone in the house, just days before Christmas. Kevin misses his family but takes their disappearence more or less in stride, feeding himself and taking care of the house.

Kevin's life gets a lot more complicated when two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) target the house.  The resouceful Kevin, in a series of hysterically funny and implausible battles, defends the house against the two inept burglars.  In a parallel story line, Kevin's frantic mother (Catherine O'Hara), having discovered his absence, battles her way back from Paris.  John Candy had a nice cameo as a polka band leader who gives her a lift.  As the clock ticks down to Christmas morning, will Kevin's prayers be answered and his family restored to him?

20 years later I still say it was over hyped when released & became the hit it did.

And, yes the character Kevin was acting bad.  Any parent would have grounded him at least.

The slap stick comedy was the hit here.  Did take enough time to get to the funny parts.

COURSE with this large group no 1 thought to set another clock to ensure they got up in time.  BUT that would not have lead to the film.  Just to point out these things.  PUT the passports, tickets in a safe place not on a counter to get milk spilled on them.

We do get the points of the film about family.  The build to the story on the neighbor after the story Buzz told about him that he was just a lonely man who missed his family.

Good to see the late John Candy in here after the 1989 hit Uncle Buck where he & Culkin worked together there.

There are plenty of extras on this DVD.

BUT, MY COMPLAINT & I HAVE HAD THIS COMPLAINT FOR SOME TIME NOW.  They used the cheap, intentional holes in them plastic DVD case.  I HATE these.  Cheap, can damage your DVD so you can go out & buy another.

437828,5,6302091632,"What if you found yourself home alone during the holidays? Well, that's part of the basic premise of this popular Christmas classic. Macaulay Culkin plays the role of Kevin, an 8-year old boy who gets fed up with his entire family. One night before they set off to Paris, Kevin wishes that every single member of his family disappears. Well, he gets his wish. Fierce winds causes a power failure, which results in everyone oversleeping. They have only a handful of minutes to get to the airport. Unfortunately for them, they've forgotten Kevin back home because of their hectic departure. Fortunately for Kevin, he now has the freedom to do whatever he wants to do. Things turn for the worse when two robbers (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) prepare to rob the house. And this is where the slapstick comedy comes in. Home Alone isn't just a Christmas movie. Sure, it has some great comedy, but the film goes much deeper than that. It shows the importance of family and family gatherings. It shows that Christmas is not only about fun and gifts, but it's also about love and caring. Anyone can enjoy watching this movie. I, for one, always enjoyed watching it during my childhood, and I still love it as I'm now in my early 20's. If I have kids in the future, then I'll show them this film (and many others) during this time of year. It's a truly entertaining film that still hasn't aged.

Grade: A",1260316800,,1393,4.572
437829,5,6302091632,"Despite the fact that Home Alone has been on TV every Christmas season for the last 10 or so years, this DVD is still worth owning as it gives you so much more to experience past the actual movie itself.

As someone who cherishes this movie from his childhood and is now an adult, the audio commentary on the movie (featuring Macaulay Culkin himself!) is a surprisingly humorous take on a kids' movie from an adult perspective. It also provided a lot of information about the difficulties of making the movie. Because Home Alone is such a widely known movie nowadays, it's hard to imagine that it started out as an incredibly low-budget, zero-reputation affair which many people thought would flop. I think this speaks to how the film industry has changed over the years, something which is good to hear for both younger and older generations.

The other special features are incredible as well, from top to bottom. This really is a ""family fun edition"" because it has something that can be enjoyed by everyone . The various trivia games (3 in all) are still challenging no matter how many times you've seen the movie. The featurettes, which range from an overall ""making of Home Alone"" to specifics on the stunts, Macaulay's own video diary from the set, and an incredibly humorous ""Where's Buzz Now?"" are all amazing additions which are lacking from just about every 90's movie released on DVD in the modern times. My favorite feature is the alternate takes and deleted scenes. Each one adds a new dimension to the movie and you really feel like it's an utter shame that each one didn't make it past the editing room floor.

Especially with the new holiday season upon us, this is definitely something to add to your collection and is a great value for your dollar.",1259884800,,1767,4.693548387096774
437830,1,6302091632,"Yes, I feel cheated.  Nowadays, when you buy a dvd labelled ""widescreen"" you should be getting anamorphic widescreen, not a letterboxed 4:3 image.  Anything less than anamorphic and yet still labelled ""widescreen"" is a ripoff.  That includes this DVD.

To add insult to injury, the picture quality of this version is exceptionally poor and has the appearance of having been dubbed directly from an old VHS tape.

It has wicked sight gags, but also is quite sentimental, esp when the disturbingly 'evil' kid, who wreaks havoc with two burglars, can do a psychological 'about-face' and bring an elderly grandfather together with his estranged son.

437925,3,6302091632,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray disc. Since Amazon does not specifically provide rating stars for PQ and AQ, I am writing this at the top, as some of the reviews here, were ported over from the SD.

PQ-3/5-sad to say, Fox has skimped again. There is significant noise and grain in this film, and the picture is murky. The film was tested on an upper end 42"" Plasma and BD30K player. I've seen older movies look better than this. The sound was a 4/5. The poor quality of the transfer merits a rent, not a buy.

The film itself was clever given Kevin's ingenious use of toys and every-day household items to overcome the burglars. It's also endearing, as he is only 8, and already ""grown up"" in many ways (grocery shopping, discussion with older man in church, and his interactions with his family). I felt the first 3/4 of the movie was not very engaging, or particularly funny, unfortunately. The last 15 minutes were the most entertaining, and the arrival of the rest of the family were heartfelt.

Also that families should appreciate one another more, a lesson that is learned by Kevin.  The interaction between the boy Kevin and the would-be burglars is over the top, but is much appreciated by kids twelve and under.  The good guys win, and the bad guys go to jail.  When he is most afraid, Kevin seeks sanctuary in the house of God, the place of ultimate safety.

played a great roll in these movies, and all of those traps he set up

child, being angry at his family wishing he would never seen them again,

This edition offers a hefty amount of extra goodies...such as over 30 minutes of deleted scenes, on the set featurettes, new interviews, and a brand new commentary track featuring director Chris Columbus & Macaulay Culkin. I have to say unlike most commentary tracks, this one is actully very informative and very fun. Macaulay and Chris seem to have so much fun watching the film. This edition like the first one is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1. I read somewhere that the video and audio is updated too, I cannot confirm if it is or not but I read that. If you own the previous edition of this film, it is definately worth your money to update to this. The special features alone warrant a double dip.

Left alone by a big family who goes to Paris for Christmas, he takes care of the big house, does grocery shopping, and stymies two burglars. The burglars think that they will have an easy time with the boy, but instead get the hassle of their lives. A neighbor man, supposedly a murderer who used his snow shovel to kill his relatives, actually lost his relatives to an old, long-unresolved argument. As a further irony, he uses his snow shovel on the burglars. The mother, thinking that she is a bad parent for having forgotten her own son, learns from the Polka troupe (that is driving her home) that many of its members hardly ever see their children in the first place.

438143,4,6302091632,"The movie industry has seen all kinds of great Christmas films,and one of those films happens to be,by far,""Home Alone"". Truth be told,while ""Home Alone"" may not have the Christmas spirit that other classic Christmas films such as ""The Santa Claus"" and ""A Christmas Story"" have,its own unique Christmas spirit,blended in with a dark,rebellious side,make it an instant Christmas classic....one of the best Christmas films EVER released.

Here,Macaulay Culkin (in his first major role,following his minor role in ""Uncle Buck"")stars as Kevin McCallister. And despite the fact that Kevin is only eight years old,Kevin being the youngest in his large and rich family makes him the family outcast. Yes,even Kevin's parents,Peter (John Heard)and Kate (Catherine O'Hara)allow Kevin to be the outcast in the family and don't even take his side in a family argument that involves Kevin. This is what leads into to Kevin being an unhappy and dissatisfied child.

However,one day,Kevin finds himself happiness and freedom. This is when his parents,after sleeping in,hustle the whole family together to fly to Paris for Christmas. After forgetting to wake up Kevin and a miscounting of the family,Kevin is left home alone without the rest of the family. And,while Peter and Kate McCallister are left searching frantically for Kevin once they discover they left him behind,things are different for Kevin. Kevin,who is glad that he has freedom from his disliked family,decides to take advantage of being home alone,with only one thing to worry about:his neighbor,""Old Man"" Marley (Roberts Blossom),who is believed to be a murderer.

And then,once Kevin finds that he is safe from Marley,more worries for Kevin arise--which,this time,find Kevin having to take action. This is when a couple of infamous and unintelligent Chicago burglars,The Wet Bandits,consisting of Harry(Joe Pesci)and Marv(Daniel Stern),begin keeping their eye on Kevin's house (think a smaller White House in this instance),hoping to rob it. Kevin is able to save himself a few times and trick Harry and Marv. But,when Harry and Marv pay more closer attention to the house and realize that Kevin is home alone,the party begins,with Harry and Marv finding themselves up against Kevin once they have entered Kevin's house,and are finding themselves losing the little ""war"" that Kevin has launched against them with his so-called booby traps.

The one thing that people continue to question about ""Home Alone"" is the fact that it has so-called ""violence"" in it. Unless you do not want your child watching any film that has any way,shape,or form of violence in it,this film is nothing to worry about otherwise. The violence here is minor violence to the point of being childish,and helps the film both entertaining and suitable,while it works well for the black comedy feel that the plot for this film has to it. So,if you want a nice Christmas film with good humor and good actors (John Candy even has a small role in this film),""Home Alone"" is one film that is not to be missed out on,especially during the holiday and the excellent bonus feautures that this DVD has on it (the VHS version of this movie works fine,but has no bonus feautures on it at all--what a dissapointment),along with well-written holiday values and essential lessons,at the same time.",1167350400,,3309,5.191011235955056
438144,5,6302091632,"Home Alone is a classic.  Almost all movies directed at children these days are silly and unwatchable for anyone over the age of ten.  So let's take it back to the 90s.

Almost every scene in this movie is memorable, and both the cast and the soundtrack is perfect.  Marley, AKA ""The South Bend Shovel Slayer"" is a particularly interesting character, and his reconciliation with his son and granddaughter is a superb subplot.  Of course, no review of Home Alone can be complete without a reference to Kevin's booby-trapping of the house.  That was complete genius.

While many people have said that there is too much violent, bad parenting, etc., I feel this movie should be taken as it is-- a film that can make the young and old alike smile.

438219,5,6302091632,"Home Alone is a brilliant comedy produced by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire), and starring child sensation Macaulay Culkin (Uncle Buck), Joe Pesci (Goodfellas), Daniel Stern (City Slickers), John Heard (187), and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice).

Home Alone is not only the highest grossing comedy of all time, (the movie has made more than 500 million dollars worldwide to date), but it is also the film that made Macaulay Culkin, who was only about 9 years old at the time of the film's release, a household name and an international mega star overnight.

Home Alone is about a child named Kevin McCallister, one of the many children of the upper-middle class and very eccentric Chicago suburbanites McCallisters, played by Heard and O'Hara, who accidentally is left behind by his huge family when they rush to the airport on their way to spend the winter break in France, so Kevin finds himself alone at home, hence the title. In the meantime, two scheming and rather stupid burglars: Harry, played by Pesci, and Marvin, played by Stern, are going house to house in Kevin's neighborhood stealing everything they can. They set their eyes on the McCallister home because as Harry describes, it is the silver platter. However, Harry and Marvin are in for a surprise and lots of pain as Kevin is smarter than they think.

Home Alone is flat-out hilarious. John Hughes, the man behind such 80's comedy classics as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and Uncle Buck, continues his string of Chicago based movies with Home Alone. There are several signature Hughes elements in the film: in addition to the Chicago theme, there is the scene where Kevin talks to himself in the bathroom mirror, right before he puts aftershave and screams (the movie's most copied signature scene). This is a reference to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris, played by Matthew Broderick, breaks the 'fourth wall' and speaks directly the viewers.

Almost 16 years after its release, Home Alone is still one of the most popular family comedies ever made.

This became an instant classic (if that isn't an oxymoron) when it was released in 1990.  Hard to believe 15 years have passed since this movie's release but the comedy contained within is timeless.

The premise is very well-known by now, having been described by almost everyone who has written a review here on Amazon.  For those few souls unfamiliar with it, they can get a glance by looking at the plot description on the back of the VHS box or DVD case.

The only thing I can say about Home Alone is it will keep your attention from start to finish and try not to wet yourself when you see what happens to Daniel Stern's character.

438270,5,6302091632,"It is reasonably hard to imagine that there's anyone who hasn't seen this film before. I like this films for many reasons, the first being that it is somewhat of a dream for every child, or person who used to be a child, to want their family to disappear and have the whole house to themselves. Anyway, the idea of Kevin being left behind while the family takes a trip to Paris is very unlikely, but in the way it's portrayed in the film at least it's theoretically possible. Kevin busies himself having fun and doing all the things he ever wanted to do around the house. However, two very inept burglars, Harry and Marv, have his house targeted. I like the way Kevin is portrayed as a kid who doesn't fit in with his family, and wishes they were gone, only to find himself missing them soon after they leave.

The comedy in the film is great, with moments I still find myself laughing at. The music by John Williams is another definate plus, mixing his own music with contemporary and classic Christmas songs, the climax sequence is still the best, and not too over the top. One thing I really liked is how, once Kevin's family leaves, he's in his own world, which involves Old Man Marley and Marv and Harry. Once the crooks are hauled off to jail, Kevin's parents come home and there's no evidence to suggest that things were ever different, except for one gold tooth. It would be impossible for the parents to ever interact with Marv and Harry as burglars, definately a comedy classic.",1132963200,,1488,4.490774907749078
438271,1,6302091632,"Home Alone is a really cute movie that the little kids will love. I loved it when I was 8, 9, but now? I'm wiser and a lot more aware. This movie is another scam, throw in a cute little boy, give a ridiculous plot and grown men burglars for him to overcome, and you've got the little kids prasing. That's fine. But once you're older, no.

First off, this movie is so unrealistic that it's annoying. Give me all of the unhelpful votes you want...I really don't care.

1) McCallister's (Mccauley Caulken)parents forget him? How can you forget him on a vacation? Sure, there are lots of people but how could someone forget their own son? Talk about a dysfunctional family. WOW

2) McCallister is 8yrs old. Yet somehow, he is smarter than a professional scientist. He can outsmart 2 grown men? How is he so smart? He makes an idiot out of them using his super smart techniques. I mean, seriously, rewatch the movie and look at EVERYTHING HE DOES! Wow, I'm a real idiot compared to this genius kid. His parents should enroll him in college. He looks ready.

3) I know that this happens in the 2nd one but I'm not going to waste my time writing a review for this. McCallister drops a brick off a huge building on one of the burglar's heads. WOW. The burglar falls over and gets right up while McCallister is giggling like a moron. He would be dead! This is idiotic stuff that makes little kids think that they could do that in real life. Oh, and little McCallister wouldn't be giggling, he'd be facing some serious charges, I don't care how old he is.

Yet somehow, this idiotic movie is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. And we've got grownups on this site prasing it. Should have this movie won 200+ million dollars? Should have Hosue of Sand and Fog have won 17 million? This is absolutely ridiculous but this shows how America works. Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The War of the Worlds and other movies like this are the ones that make these insanely high numbers.",1129593600,12,1969,4.413223140495868

To really enjoy the movie and look past the cheesy dialogue and totally unrealistic plot you have to be a kid now or were a kid when the movie first came out and you grew up on the movie.  I fall into the latter.  Watching the movie now it does seem kind of cheesy and unrealistic but you have to look past that.  Now that I am in my mid 20's I still enjoy watching the movie because it takes me back to when I was a kid and life was so much simplier.  The quotes from the movie are classic if you grew up on the movie you know what I am talking about.  From the different characters, the holiday setting, and the simple message at the end Home Alone is a movie that makes you want to rewatch over and over again.  I have found that the people who truly appreciate Home Alone for its true worth are people who were kids when the movie first came out and watched the movie over and over again during their childhood and for some strange but pleasant reason still enjoy the movie and during every holiday season we watch the movie no matter how old or busy we are.",1126656000,5,1172,4.069565217391304

This was a really good movie!  It doesn't make my favorites list, but it was very entertaining and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.  Some parts were a teeny bit sickening, but you can expect that in any movie.  The main thing that I thought was nice was that the bad guys were both funny AND threatening at the same time.  Sometimes bad guys are just so goofy that it's hard to believe that they really have any evil in them.  But the bady guys in ""Home Alone"" were a nice mix of evil and funny.  Overall, I'm glad I gave this movie a chance.  Although I don't recommend it for small children as some parts could be creepy, I think kids 8+ will love it.",1123718400,3,966,4.292817679558011

I think a lot of under-30s love ""Home Alone"" because it's one of those nostalgic 90's movies.  Home Alone is probably best appreciated by young adults who watched it throughout their childhood OR by kids under 12.  HAVING SAID THAT...it still rocks!!!  Home Alone is a funny, cute, silly, cheesy, delightful, feel-good holiday classic with an offbeat sense of humor.  It'll leave you with a warm n' fuzzy feeling, but it's not syrupy-sweet.  Overall, Home Alone = HEARTWARMING & HILARIOUS!!!

Also i have to say this is a christmas classic and should not be put down as a bad kids movie, its alot more than that its a film for all ages.

What is brillant about the acting in this movie...is Joe Pesci!! It really shows his flexibilty as an actor. I mean look at the likes of 'Goodfellas'...he plays a physco gangster!! THen in this film he is funny character with many humbles of fun.(Al Breso)

438321,5,6302091632,"I recently bought this DVD, and i must say it just doesn't disappoint. I remember it was one of my many favourite movies when i was growing up, and it was always fun. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give tremendous performances in this movie too. The casting is just so perfect..Macaulay Culkin as ""Kevin""..Catherine O'Hara as ""Kevin's Mother""..Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the frustrated and bumbling burglars..right down to ""Kevin's"" brother, who's name escapes me right now, and John Candy, who has a small part as the ""Polka King of the Midwest"". But really every actor in this movie seems to just be so natural for the parts they play.

If you haven't already seen this movie, i suggest you do so as soon as possible. It's truly a classic and will have you laughing at the ingenius ways ""Kevin"" booby-traps his house. The movie starts out with ""Kevin's"" family getting ready for a Christmas Vacation to France, that they'll go on the next morning. ""Kevin"" is left on the outer it seems, as his family have no time for him while they all pack their belongings for the trip. He then gets into a fight with his older brother and is sent up to the attic to spend the night. The next morning, the family sleeps-in and in the hurry to the airport, forgets that Kevin is still up in the attic..

The movie really picks up though, when the burglars (Pesci and Stern) finally try and enter the house. Their plan at first seems to be about stealing valuables, but it quickly turns to ""Get that kid!!"", which in turn produces some of the funniest material in a Family/Comedy i've really ever seen. ""Kevin"" is just a genius with how he rigs the house as a massive booby-trap basically, and the burglars are extremely funny with the way they get so frustrated.

This DVD also comes with Scene Access, allowing you to immediately go to any scene in the movie without fast-forwarding. It also has Multiple Language Subtitles, and the Original Movie Trailers for Home Alone 1, 2 and 3. With 3, in my personal opinion, being the least appealing of the series.

I think this movie is a classic, and will have you laughing along with it until the end. It's a great comedy, that you don't have to watch with anyone if you don't want to. You can watch it by yourself and get just as much enjoyment out of it. I also suggest seeing Home Alone 2, which is a pretty good sequel that keeps most of the same cast from the first movie, such as Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci to name a few.",1116806400,,2476,4.459161147902869
438322,5,6302091632,"If Christopher Columbus discovered America, then Chris Columbus rediscovered American comedy. From ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" to ""Nine Months"", he has directed some of the finest contemporary comedies of the 1990s'.

But no matter what Columbus does, his crowning achievement will always be 1990's ""Home Alone"". Between Columbus's skillful directing and John Hughes' brilliant script, this film represents what American comedy should be.

The plot of the film is quite simple yet somewhat unrealistic, which is where the movie's impeccable charm lies. Eight - year - old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin before he met Michael Jackson) is the black sheep of his loose Chicago family. His parents (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) treat him like a child, while the rest of his family - including smarmy Uncle Frank, older brother Buzz and the bedwetting Fuller (brother Kieran) - treats him like trash. After getting into a huge fight with them the night before a Christmas vaction to France, Kevin wishes that he doesn't have a family. His mom says she hopes his wish comes true. The next day, the family wakes up late and is in such a rush to get to the airport that they leave Kevin asleep in the attic. Thinking his wish has come true, Kevin lives it up at home. Little does he know, burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are home alone, too, and taking advantage of it as well.

438347,5,6302091632,"This movie was a favorite amongst many when it first came out in 1990, and more than a decade later, this movie *still* remains a classic, and will continue to be a classic for many more years to come.

The story is simple, really: young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is the underdog of the family; always getting picked on by his older siblings, and feeling like an outcast. One day, he gets into it with his older brother, and Kevin ends up being punished. During his punishment, he wishes that he could spend a christmas by himself without any of his family members. Wouldn't you know it - due to his family's carelessness, they accidently leave Kevin home on their way to the airport (to fly to Paris for Christmas vacation.)

And from there, the fun begins. While Kevin is home by himself, two bumbling, nincompoop burglars (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) known as the ""Wet Bandits,"" set their sites on Kevin's house. When Kevin figures this out, he sets the house up with all sorts of tricks and traps, to out-maneuver these two clowns. And it's *hilarious* (listening to Daniel Stern's agonized wails -- as if he were castrated -- leaves me gasping for breath!) Anytime I watch this movie, these scenes in general have a way of bringing out the devilishly-maniacal, mischievous kid in me (and no doubt, many other viewers as well.) Of course, the movie isn't all about brash, goofy slapstick; there are some moving moments scattered throughout the film (particularly when Kevin befriends an old man - who is feared throughout the neighborhood - who teaches Kevin a few things about life, as well as receiving a little bit of advice from young Kevin along the way.)

Home Alone, Home Alone 2, and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation are the Christmas comedies I find myself coming back to most. Indeed, all three of these films are classics that should be watched around the holidays, or *any* time of the year, for some non-stop entertainment & laughs, as well as some heartwarming sentiment beneath it all.",1107820800,70,2017,4.757142857142857
438348,5,6302091632,"HOME ALONE was very successful in its theatrical run and its popularity has proven to be enduring. Small wonder. This is a very funny and entertaining movie. Kevin, the youngest member of his family, goes to bed wishing his family would disappear. The following morning finds his family in a rush to get to the airport to catch their flight to Paris, where they are going to spend the Christmas holiday, and running very late. In the hubbub, Kevin gets left behind. He awakens to find that his wish seems to have been granted; he's been left home alone. His elation at finding he's the ""man of the house"" is only one of many great scenes in this movie. Macaulay Culkin shines as Kevin. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also very funny as a pair of burglars working the neighborhood.

The editorial reviewer here comments that the ""violence"" in the later stages of HOME ALONE is ""over the top"". Over the top of what? There are no knives or machine guns in evidence here. Some broken christmas tree ornaments, a red hot doorknob, a couple of paint cans, some icy stairs, a b-b gun ... this is the kind of violence we're talking about here. Realistically, yeah, these burglars are ridiculously inept and somebody could get seriously hurt on slippery concrete steps, but as theatrical violence goes this is pretty harmless stuff. Pretty funny stuff, too.

This is a classically funny movie and one the whole family can enjoy. If you haven't seen it, give yourself a treat. If you're like me, you'll want your own copy so you can watch it whenever the mood hits. With Christmas a central part of the plot, HOME ALONE works especially well during the holiday season.

Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also quite comical as the ""wet bandits"" and bring a great sense of goofiness to the film.

Overall, this movie is still funny to this day and it never gets old.  Some of the traps that Kevin sets up are lethal (i.e. iron falling from laundry-shoot scene) and certainly unrealistic, but then again, this is Hollywood.

Kevin McCallister, an eight year old boy was mistakenly left home alone by his family who flew off to Paris, and now he must defend his house from two bungling burglars with unrealistic but cleaver booby-traps, while his family desperately tries to get home to him.

This hilarious and heartwarming movie was made for all ages. It has a certain serenity to it, but it's still suspenseful. Its one of those movies where you can watch it over and over again, and the funny parts you laughed at the first time, you're still laughing at the second and third time. Many holiday movies are about finding the ""meaning of Christmas"". Though Christmas does play a big part in this movie, I believe this movie is about finding the meaning in ones family.

Although this movie is a tad bit impractical, it still gives you the feeling of the holiday spirit. It has a great sound track, a great story line, and impressive acting. There are many unforgettable lines such as, ""I made my family disappear"", and ""I'm going to give you till the count of ten, to get your ugly, yella, no good keester off my property, before I pump your guts full of lead."" And scenes where Kevin is in the bathroom and makes that prominent face when he's yelling with his hands on his cheeks.

This movie is rated one of the top ten Christmas movies and on the top twenty best sellers list. It's definitely one of my favorites and will always be. It's always been a tradition that I've watched this classic every year during Christmas time with my family.

Released back in 1990, HA was released on an unsuspecting public and became the largest grossing comedy motion picture of all time. While it is incredibly fun and entertaining and funny, should we be laughing at how a family left a little 8 year old boy home alone during Christmas?. Or was it really their fault?. The movie centers on the McAlister family. Headed by parents John Heard and Catherine 'O' Hara, the family, and quite a large one at that, are off to the airport. Unfortunatley, there was a mix up and little Kevin(Macaulay Culkin) is left behind. When Kevin realizes the horrors, he begins to realize that this is every little kid's dream. A life with no parents, no grown ups, no nothing. His own house to himself. He can do whatever he wants. It quickly goes sour when two burglars(Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern), plan on robbing the house. Something Kevin overhears and prepares for. When the two bumbling doofus' come to collect, they enter a house full of boobytraps and other inventions of pain and torture that Kevin devised to save his house. Okay, so th mistake of leaving Kevin behind is somewhat plausible and can be forgiven. It happened, and it's not that it couldn't, and the family were mortified and tried everything they could to get back. Or at least the mother did. Some reviewers were quick to blame, even calling the mother 'horrible', but that is not right. It was an honest mix-up, and she was scared as heck and it was her who did everything she could to get back. Is she that bad for what happened?. Not at all. What strains credibility, is the robbers and the total fun house that Kevin turns his home into. Obviously, this is the best part, and the part most want to see, but it's inconceivable. This little kid, in a time of turmoil and danger, instantly turns into a brilliant little MacGyver, with everything working properly, and having the best timing of any kid, or adult, around. But then again, this is not a movie for logic. It's fun. Nothing but fun and entertainment and HA succeeds on every level in that area. Director Chris Columbus shoots the film really well, and the time and feel of the season is warm and inviting. The actors are all on their game and seem to enjoy what they are doing. Pesci and Stern(not the over the hill, hanging by a thread ""B"" stars, as an inept review below states), are hilarious as they try to withstand, and fail, every thing Kevin throws at them. Culkin himself is adorable and has a nice presence and charm. HA is not up there with any of Hollywood's epics, but it is a holiday and comedy classic, and it does what it does. Followed by a decent sequel, and a part 3 and 4 that should be avoided at all costs.",1099785600,3,2847,4.508704061895552

Of course, the only bonus features on this DVD are the trailers to the Home Alone trilogy, and the sound is only stereo, but still, that's great because I LOVE THIS MOVIE! You know, because I love the funny parts - including the fake movie Kevin watches and uses to scare off the pizza guy and the villians (I always wanted to try that!) The fake movie, in case you didn't know, is translated into foreign languages as well! Speaking of which, this DVD comes in English, French, and Spanish audio and English subtitles. I've seen this DVD in English sound with closed-captioning from the TV, and on the computer in Spanish sound with English subtitles (still remains Kevin's infamous scream)! Yeah, I'm glad Fox has a Spanish option for this disc because I'm currently finishing up my Spanish class at my prep school and from time to time, I watch DVDs in Spanish (if available; otherwise it's French for the Canadian viewers!) You know, this week or next week, I'm bringing this DVD into Spanish class for my teacher to show. EVERYONE WOULD LAUGH!
This is a sweet movie. The DVD may not be the best, but it's still a great buy! Enjoy!

438376,2,6302091632,"Dont get me wrong. I didn't give 2 stars to the movie, i gave 2 stars for the DVD!
Home Alone smashed box offices with an unexpected christmas story of a kid who accidently finds himself alone at home. Now every one shoudl have seen it by now, and most of the people who loved the film as like me already have it on VHS anyway. right?
So why does one of the most succsesfull and popular movies of all time get a poor treatment when it comes to putting it onto DVD? It comes in widescreen, and a trailer, and subtitiles, and thats all!!! ITS NOT EVEN IN SURROUND SOUND!!!!!!!! (5.!)
I remember when the first two movies came out I watched behind the scenes things about the movie on TV and I remember them talking specidly on the second film about how it wasn't shot at christmas and how they used fake snow, and the pigeons wernt real, and Daniles saying he was the guy in charge of the comedy, and if he didn't find somthign funny, it was his desicion.... so WHERE ARE THOSE FEATURETTES????????
For anyone who dosent care for bonus features, then pick this movie up, youll love it. But if your like me, and do enjoy bonus features, then this movie has been abused!!!!!
No bonus features? Not in surround sound? No featurettes? which i know for sure exsist. Dont you think a smash hit like this movie, which is without a doubht one of the most popular movies of all time,should have had better treatment as a DVD? I think they have done a poor job with this DVD and had better realese a speichel edition one day to justify what a poor effert they have done with this DVD for such a great movie.",1083024000,6,1594,4.281456953642384
438377,5,6302091632,"This Christmas classic is so enjoyable, due to the engagement between Kevin and two superb burglars (ala Pesci and Stern).  In my view, these two burglars make it the great comedy that it is.  There expressiveness in being duped by the redhead protecting his family home is creative and simply good comedy to enjoy.
The neighbor with the shovel is another outstanding character that pops up in key spots in the plotline.  Candy is so-so as the polka king.  The mother played by O'Hara is authentic too in her concern, and the rest are just support cast in this.
The plot is possible due to the setup of the busy family preparing for the trip with all the chaos and Kevin being somewhat of a sore-thumb in all this.
The results are a howl!  Enjoy watching this periodically over the years.  Too my way of thinking, this makes a movie truly great, its ability to have lasting power.  This might be one of those that endures the fads and all that make many flicks ok, but would one buy them or rent them or watch them again?  Likely not.

The boy had said he didn't want to see his family ever again, because they were so mean to him, then it appeared that his family had disappeared. During the holiday season, while he was home alone, he had the time of his life; at first. Then he heard these thieves were going to come after him and try to rob his house. He sets up a series of hilariously funny traps to catch the bandits and ends up catching two robbers that the police had been after for months!

438403,4,6302091632,"When ever I was teaching any sort of class (in an actual classroom) that involved a look at movies I would do a class discussion where the students were challenged to come up with the Top 25 money making movies of all time (usually without the adjustment for inflation that would put ""Gone With the Wind"" back on top).  Just about every time I did this little exercise in class we would get to the point where there was one spot left open (it used to be in the top ten), and I would tell them it was the biggest money making comedy of all-time and they would keep throwing out names and not getting anywhere and then I would say, okay, I have a clue: but you are going to hate yourselves.  At that point I would slap my hands to my face and scream, at which point the entire classroom would literally groan.
But you cannot be the biggest money making comedy of all time (it is now down to #19 in this era of Harry Potter, Frodo, lost fish and Carribean pirates) if nobody enjoyed you, so you have to remember there is actually something funny behind the ""Home Alone"" backlash (or perhaps it should more properly be called the Macaulay Culkin backlash).  The reason people hate to admit they like this film is because writer-director John Hughes tries to have it three ways.  First, he wants to indulge in the childish fantasy of a kid having the run of the house and being able to do anything he wants.  This is because young Kevin (Culkin) accidentally gets left home behind by his family and is convinced it was because he wished such a thing.  Second, Kevin gets to play the superhero in the end as he turns a normal suburban home into a virtual death trap for the pair of inept burglars who want to make a holiday score.  Third, the story play on the heartstrings not only with the goal of reuniting a little boy with his mother, but through a story involving the nasty old man who lives next door and who Kevin is assured by his older brother is the Snow Shovel Murderer.
Those last scenes are important, because Hughes intends to redeem the indulgence of childish dreams and the comic violence with those scenes in which Kevin sends a message to the real Santa Claus through one of his helpers and meets somebody at church.  This touch of heart felt realism at the center of the film's implausibility explains why it is difficult to dismiss ""Home Alone.""  At the very least, you have to grant that Hughes was ambitious, and while you are at it you might as well admit that Caulkin was cute.  Hollywood milked that cuteness to death, and the kid has grown up to be another one of those former child actor walking tragedies you hear about all the time, but he is able to play in all three of the ballparks Hughes arranges, which is not bad work for a kid.
I have to admit that for the most part I was suckered in by the schmaltz.  When I think fondly about this movie it is about Kevin with his mom (Catherine O'Hara) and Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom) rather than the over the top antics of the ""Wet Bandits"" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern).  Still, the Rube Goldberg devices Kevin uses to defend his home and take out the bad guys is part of a grand tradition that goes back to all those Road Runner cartoons that are clearly the main inspiration for the fun.",1070236800,5,3264,4.350328947368421

This Film put Micaulay Culkin (Richie Rich, The Good Son) on the map. It's about every kids dream and every parents nightmare - (Or is it the revers?) - being left behind by your parents.
Starting with a simple wish of making his family dissappear - Micaulay realizes that they actually forgot him on their trip on the way to Paris.
Add to the plot two mischievious burglers played brilliantly by Jope Pesci (My Cousin Vinny, With Honors, JFK) and Daniel Stern (City Slickers, My Blue Heaven, Dilbert), they bumble and create havok on the unsuspecting youth trapped alone in his house.
The stunts ad gags are hysterical and somewhat not realistic, but the fun and humor is universal. And the appearance of the late John Candy (Wagon's East, JFK, Spaceballs)as the Polka King is hysterical.
Key perfomances by the mother and father played by Cathrine O'Hara (Best In Show, Home Fries, The Nightmare Before Christmas) and John Herd (My Fellow Americans, the Pelican Brief, Awakenings) who are incredibly resourceful in getting themselves back from Paris to Chicago to get their son.
Funny, adventurous and a lesson in life, love and family. There is even a key scene with the olderly man who lives next door and is thought to be a killer played by Robert Blossom (Doc Hollywood, Visionquest)who eventually teaches Macaulay what family is all about
With a wonderful Acadamy Award winning score by John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, ET) this movie is great for everyone in the whole family. Watch it every holiday! (11-30-03)",1070150400,2,1743,4.911864406779661

I think this movie is one of a kind, and I don't think the other THREE can match up to the original. I watched the trailer for Home Alone 3, and although were some funny moments, I guess a lot of trailers will show the best moments. And the new kid just doesn't have the same innocence and cheekiness as Macaulay Culkin.

While Kevin is at home, two burglars are trying to break in. The burglars are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.

I believe at one time it was the highest grossing comedy.  Maybe still is.  It's become a holiday classic right up there with the greats.
And yet, all we get is a poor DVD transfer with only a theatrical trailer for an extra?
Home Alone is a great movie.  Every kids dream to have the run of the house, especially if you do have a large family.  The movie has humor, slapstick action, warmth...it's a great movie.
Certainly, since all of the particulars are still living and active (except John Candy) we should be able to get some kind of commentary, maybe some current interviews, deleted scenes, etc..

438411,4,6302091632,"In 1990, another Christmas movie classic was made. This movie, ""Home Alone"" is a holiday classic that you can't find anywhere else. The cast is great, the scenes are hilarious, and it's wonderful family movie. Macaulay Culkin starts his fame as the family icon for parents and thier children.
The movie starts out in Chicago, IL at the McCillister house. Here we meet Kevin's family that is running all over the house preparing for their Christmas trip to Paris. Also in the house scoping out the place is Harry (Joe Pesci), a crook posed a cop that is planning on robbing the house after they leave. Now here is where the problems start. When the whole family is eating pizza for dinner, Kevin (Culkin) is looking around for his plain cheese pizza because that's all he eats. So his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) eats it on purpose. Then Kevin attacks him and the place becomes a mess and soda is spilled and the passports are soaked, etc. Kevin's mother Kate (Caterine O'Hara) sends him to his room. In Kevin's state of anger he says to his mother that he doesn't want to see his family again. Now while in bed Kevin says, ""I wish they would all dissapear."" During the night the power goes out and the alarm clocks goes out. The next moring they are rushing left and right to get to the airport. Here's the problem: THEY FORGOT KEVIN!
Now kevin wakes up an sees nobody is home. He actually thinks that his wish came true. Now at first Kevin loves this. He jumps on the bed, shoots his brother Buzz's BB gun, takes his brother's life savings, and eats all the junk food in the world and watches ""R"" rated films. While the family is on the plane, Kevin's mother gets the feeling they forgot something. Kevin's father Peter (John Heard) asks her, ""What could we have forgotten?"" Then Kate screams: KEVIN! Now while Kevin still is having fun back at home, the family is in Paris trying to get a flight back home. and calling the police, etc.
One day, Kevin goes out shopping and spots a misterious van in the neighbor's driveway. It's the crooks. Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Pesci), The Wet Bandits. Now after Kevin actually goes out shopping to get food and milk, he notices the guys in the van. Now he realizes they are after his house. Sorry Christmas Eve night he plans his battle against the crooks.
The gadgets and the tricks he pulls on the crooks are undoubtably hilarious. First, when the crooks starts talking to Kevin through the back door pretending to be Santa Claus and an Elf, Kevin takes his borther's BB gun and sticks it through the cathole and shoots Harry is the lower region. Then Marv sticks his heasd through the cathole and he gets shot in the head. Now there is ice on all the stairways, the front door knob is burning hot and when Hary touches the knob, the knob's inprinted ""M"" is impronted into Harry's hand. Lol! Then in the basement there is tar paper on the stairs and eventually there is a nail sticking up which Marv steps on with his bare foot. See what other tricks Kevin has got up his sleeve.
This movie, ""Home Alone"" is the perfect holiday movie that the entire family can enjoy. It's another Christmas classic. One thing this movie does for me is it gets me into the holiday spirit. In the beginning when Kevin said he didn't want to see his family again, throughout the movie, you realize how important family is, especially around the holidays.

He also learns the value of money, and of course, personal hygiene (the most famous scene in the film). Of course, nothing is more daring than his fighting his fear of the furnace, and how he battles the burglars!

438481,3,6302091632,"Home Alone, staring Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone 2) and directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), is a childish movie.  A very childish movie.  One that succeeds in entertaining but something that you enjoy as a little kid and laugh at when you're an adult.  Even the concept of the movie is dumb.  Like I said, it is not funny, it's just entertaining.  Let me tell you something comedy fans:  Seeing adults being destroyed by a ten year old child does not sound so ""realistic"" to me.  Otherwise, it's a pure treat for the whole family.
Home Alone tells the story of Kevin McCallister, a ten year old boy who finds that his parents accidentally left him behind during their trip.  Just when he starts to celebrate, he discovers that the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Goodfellas, and Daniel Stern, Bushwhacked), a group of robbers, are in his neighborhood.  After seeing numerous wanted reports on TV, Kevin decides to take on the Wet Bandits.  The last twenty minutes of the movie shows us the colossal battle between Kevin and the Wet Bandits.  Since this is a children's movie, the children always win and that's what makes this movie way too predictable.
Despite the Wet Bandit's stupidity, Home Alone will not disappoint.  Kids surely will enjoy it but parents, I suggest you slowly sneak out of the room.  Besides, there's nothing really violent in the film except the fight between Kevin and the bandits though it doesn't even include one drop of blood.  I think movie is loved by kids not because of it's actors but because of the violence.  Kids today hardly ever see a red-blooded R-rated action movie and this is like a free ticket to seeing people getting beat up.  Especially by a kid.  What also disappoints me about the movie is that Macaulay Culkin overpowers the adults and bandits in intelligence.  Several plans, such as Culkin setting up a room of cardboard figures to confuse the robbers, is simply not believable and a normal child could not possible make up these ideas.  This was not a screenplay meant for John Hughes but oh well.  The performances are satisfying but not excellent and the script is OK.  Overall, 3 stars.
Movie:  Home Alone
Actors/Actresses - Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Candy
Time: 100 minutes
Rated PG for some scenes of childish violence",1030579200,,2338,4.7925
438482,5,6302091632,"Home alone is a great family film to watch.  I've watched this movie since I was 4 and I am now 14 and I still laugh at it.  Macaulay Culkin does wonderful job portraying an 8 year old boy who is accidently left alone in his home by his family and also protecting his home from 2 criminals (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) by setting up mischivous contraptions that cause horrible pain!  Although Culkin's acting career has not been doing so well these days,his early movies like this one is something you will love.
Anyway, the story starts off with a family known as the McCallisters getting ready to go on a vacation.  At dinner, the youngest child, Kevin (Culkin)creates a big mess in the kitchen (After getting anoid by his brother) and is punished to sleep in the attic.  Because of that,kevin wishes his family would just dissapear.but coensidently a storm comes in the middle of the night and takes out the electricity causing the alarm clocks to go out.  The family over sleeps and then rushes to get ready when they realize they are behind scedule and are on the verge of missing their flight.  With all the hurrying and a miss count, the family goes on vacation not knowing they left kevin behind.  Kevin on the other hand wakes up and sees that there is nobody there and assumes that his wish came true.  Kevin automatically goes wild and does things he would need permission to do.  But Kevin's fun isn't going as well as he thought, 2 crooks by the name of Marve(Stern) and Harry (Pesci)want to robb his home.  Kevin does what he can to make it look like there are people in his home but Marve and Harry smell something fishy because they know the McCallister family went on vacation.  Eventually the crooks realize that they were just being outsmarted by a little kid who is home alone and decide that the next time they come, nothing will stop them.  Kevin knows this is bad news for him and wishes his family would come back.  To protect his home, Kevin builds wild contraption that anybody laugh.  These contraptions show dumb robbers can be.
Anybody who sees this movie for the first time will laugh their heads off.  Although a little boy trying to take out two crooks is totally impossible, Home Alone is a really great family film that shows that what you wish for may not be something you want.  This movie is appropriate for all ages so If I were you I'd by this movie and watch with my family because it will be something they will enjoy.",1029110400,7,2459,4.477578475336323

Saying you never want to see your family again, and then waking up the next day and having them gone is every child's nightmare, but then experiencing the adventure that follows would be so cool. Actually, it would probably be a terrible thing to really experience, but watching it sure is fun. THe ways this 8 year old outsmarts two con-artists is so great. I wish I had some opportunity just to see if I could be that creative. This movie is super-entertaining. Watch it with your family- everyone will be amused.",1018828800,,693,4.257575757575758
438488,5,6302091632,"This is one of my top five favorite Christmas movies of all time! Although set in a contemporary time frame, the plot is a classic fairy tale format much like Hansel and Gretal or many other traditional folk tales in which a child is lost or deserted by the adults in his life and learns that he can fend for himself. Along the way the main character in this film is empowered by learning that many of his fears are groundless or can be overcome and that one of the people he has always feared is actually an ally. This film is by turns hysterically funny, scary, and heartwarming. It is enjoyable for kids and adults.
NOTE: Parents of very small children might want to preview this (or at least watch it with their child) as there are some scary scenes and borderline comedy violence(of the slapstick Saturday morning ""cat-splat"" variety, but with real people instead of animation) that might be disturbing to some kids. Also a few incidences of language that some parents might find objectionable. That said, I should also say that I have personally watched this film with kids as young as 5 and adults as old as 80's who have all found it hilarious and engaging.",1008720000,,1165,4.552380952380952
438489,3,6302091632,"Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why?  Because ""Home Alone,"" directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.
 This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the ""Wet Bandits,"" Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.
 The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...
 Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.
 Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate.  Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.
 The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, ""Old Man Marley,"" played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.
 The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief.  Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, ""Home Alone"" is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, ""Why.""  And the answer?  Who can say.  Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.",1008633600,,5824,4.801005025125628

438529,5,6302091632,"I love films that are hilarious and yet have a message.
In that regard, ""Home Alone"" has to be one of my all-time favorites.
""Home Alone"" is funny and has colorful wintry Christmas scenes of snowy Chicago. A little eight-year-old boy (Macaulay Culkin)gets left behind by a freak oversight when his parents and a multitude of houseguests leave on a trip to Paris. The night before they leave, he gets into a fight with an older brother and is punished, so informs his mother he is sick of his family and wishes he never had to see any of them again. The next morning when he discovers them gone, he thinks his wish has been granted, and is at first happy. Then he begins to get lonely and regrets his wish.
Meanwhile, a couple of incompetent crooks decide to burglarize Kevin's house. Kevin gets wind of the plot, and devises numerous booby-traps and stratagems to defeat them, often with hilarious results. The confrontation with these would-be burglars provides the conflict and humor, without which there would be no story and no fun. However, ""Home Alone"" shines as a movie because it is more than the numerous belly laughs it produces. The film also has a subtle moral message, i.e., don't take your loved ones for granted.
An old, bearded man lives next door to Kevin, and the popular fiction among the neighborhood children is that he is some kind of ""snow shovel murderer."" He isn't of course, and after a couple of scary run-ins with the old man, the hero kid, Kevin, meets by chance the old man in a church at night listening to a choir sing Christmas carols. The old man talks to him, tells him misunderstandings between family members are common, and even when loved ones hurt you, you never stop loving them, even when you think you want nothing more to do with them. Then the old man confesses that he has had a dispute with his own son for a couple of years that has prevented him from seeing his own granddaughter. So Kevin advises him to call his son and end the dispute, but the old man says he is afraid to do so. But Kevin tells him the only way to conquer his fear is to just go ahead and do it.
The interesting plot elements here are (1) the old man acts as ""the wise old man,"" the mentor, which is one of the 12 archetypes of myth used so effectively by fiction writers for millennia, and (2)the old man is a mirror of the little boy. It is interesting to see how often a ""mirror,"" i.e., a literary device, is used in fiction, and how effective it is at underscoring the nature of the conflict or the characters.
The film has a happy ending, of course, with the boy and the old man both solving their family problems. They share a common epiphany and resolution as each reunites with his family, a warm and satisfying end to this warm holiday tale.",1004832000,9,2770,4.433333333333334
438530,4,6302091632,"I was 8 years old when this movie debuted, and needless to say, I loved it.  Especially the 30 minute sequence that climaxes when the burglars (Pesci and Stern, both playing their over the top characters with a great zeal) have to deal with Kevin's boobytraps.
However, in retrospect as an almost 20 year old, that sequence is the one thing that holds back this movie from reaching the heights of, say A Christmas Story.  The rest of the movie is excellent, taking the simplistic themes of childhood abandonment and family...and squeezing the utmost honesty and laughter out of each scene.  Try not to let your inner child giggle with excitment as the young protagonist gleefully jumps on his parents bed WHILE eating popcorn, or going grocery shopping by yourself, and getting anything you want.
Culkin couldn't have done a better job capturing the little kid that can irritate you to no end, but you deeply adore.

Of course the movie made like $200 million and spawned  two sequels I wouldn't watch unless you duct-taped me to a chair.
No,  what made it so fun was going to see it a SECOND time. I told 2 friends how  incredibly awful this movie was and, insulting my fine-tuned sense of  humor, said they wanted to see it right away 'cause if I didn't like it, it  was probably hilarious. So I dared them and they double dared me and off we  went to the SuperSaver theaters (I wasn't giving Hughes any more of my cash  than I had to).
It only took 5 minutes for my buddies to realize that  this movie was really a horror show. Once that happened we were all able to  enjoy ourselves. All through the movie we made loud and pointed comments to  the screen, making up dialogue and begging Pesci to smack Culkin over the  head with something heavy and be done with him. The best part was, no one  in the theater found us annoying or told us to shut the (deleted) up.  Instead, everyone (well, 15 folks or so) laughed with us and joined in the  fun. And that's why, I think, that the movie was such a huge hit-- people  hated it so much, it was so nauseating, that people went to see it again  just to insult everyone and everything about it.
