558918,5,6303092012,"An unusual film from MGM, featuring a grim look to the harsh reality of prison conditions. Being an early talkie (1930), the first thing to surprise me favorably, was that the camera wasn't static at all, on the contrary there is as lot of camera movement indeed, showing lots of eye-catching angles of life in prison, especially of that big dining hall.
On the other hand, the pacing and the acting are both first rate, Chester Morris steals the film with his convincing performance of a forger finally finding the reason (love, what else?) for goin' straight; Wallace Beery gives another of those tough-guy performances (who after all, has a big heart hidden deep inside) he excelled at; and then newcomer, Robert Montgomery, is good as weak young lad, locked-in because of mansalughter.
A real discovery! Ought to look for more early talkies featuring this great tough-guy, forgotten actor, Chester Morris
Watch it!!!",1053129600,3,920,5.019607843137255
558919,5,6303092012,"I was very pleased to find this long-obscure film on video.  Still on of the most successful prison films ever produced, THE BIG HOUSE follows three inmates: a forger, a murderer, and a rather innocuous youth convicted of manslaughter.  Big, brawny and wholly believable is Beery as the top bull con who settles fights and runs the yard: he plans a big break to escape the sadistic guards and the endless stoolpigeons.  Weak-willed Montgomery informs the warden (Lewis Stone) of the impending escape attempt and the consequences which follow are horrific.  Grimly realistic and often brutal, this was the Granddaddy of all prison films, exposing mean conditions, the paranoia, the vicious system that deepened criminal resolves among inmates.  George Hill's uncomprimising direction captures all the ugliness and futility of prison life and Beery is perfect as the goonish ringleader of the inmates: half clown, half menace, soft-hearted, soft-headed, but with a killer instinct that is iron-willed. As the intelligent member of the threesome, Chester Morris is excellent.  Young Montgomery had an uncharacteristic role as a spineless, despicable cringer wholly without character.  The film was inspired by a particularly bloody riot in Auburn Prison in New York the previous year.  The role of Butch Schmidt was originally intended for the terminally ill Lon Chaney, Sr. who would die soon after making his only talkie, THE UNHOLY THREE.",1036972800,2,1438,5.331858407079646

559011,5,6303092012,"In many ways, MGM's 1930 production of THE BIG HOUSE remains the ultimate movie about men behind bars. It's the very first serious handling of the subject, establishing the general narrative devices prison films have copied and improvised ever since. However, unlike all those others, THE BIG HOUSE is different in that it's an archetypal depiction of everything we've come to associate with the genre. Even after eight decades it still packs quite a wallop, especially in its grim prison riot climax.

Expertly directed by George Hill, THE BIG HOUSE top bills Chester Morris and Wallace Beery in standout roles as hardened cell mates in a badly overcrowded penitentiary run by a tough but compassionate warden, played by Lewis Stone. Robert Montgomery is a newly incarcerated prisoner whose nerves begin to unravel under the pressure. Pretty Leila Hyams plays Montgomery's sister and Morris' sweetheart.

THE BIG HOUSE contains several memorable scenes, one of which takes place in the prison chapel where the convicts are reciting The Lord's Prayer while under the pews they're passing guns and bullets to each other in preparation for their crashout on Thanksgiving Day. They also sing the hymn, ""Open the Gates"", which has a perversely ironic twist Morris and Beery appreciate, eyeing each other knowingly. The big riot sequence itself is well staged with a gritty authenticity that's quite forceful even today. The film's strengths were recognized by the Academy, winning for best screenplay and best sound recording. The large prison set and grounds were reused by Hal Roach the following year for Laurel and Hardy's first feature length film, PARDON US (1931).

The DVD-R of THE BIG HOUSE from the Warner Achives seems to have been transferred off the same master used for the VHS release. While a bit soft - most likely due to the source print - it's still a very nice image, with excellent contrast and no lines, scratches or white specks. The audio contains some pops and hiss which could've been cleared up by an extensive restoration, but it doesn't detract from enjoying this presentation which is the best I've seen on this great antique.

THE BIG HOUSE is a film that's been copied a lot, and although I've seen several prison movies, I find myself always coming back to it. I especially like its vivid, straightforward style, and the hard bitten edge that's offset by some genuinely tender moments. Its age works to its advantage, making it seem almost like a documentary of prison life in 1930. Watching the film perspectively, one can sense just how influential it was destined to become.

Highly recommended.",1356825600,6,2627,5.029885057471264

559015,4,6303092012,"""The Big House"" is the first of the prison films to capture an audience, and as such, it is the archetype for almost every prison movie to follow, apart from the ""chain gang"" films that have their origins in Paul Muni's excellent 1932 ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang.""

One doesn't expect a film such as this from MGM. After all, during the early 30s, MGM was best known for Garbo's ""Anna Christie"" (1930) and ""Mata Hari"" (1931), ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), musicals (e.g., ""Lord Byron"", ""Good News"", ""Dancing Lady"" etc.) and the ""Tarzan"" films. ""The Big House"" fits better into Warner Brothers, with Edward G Robinson's (1930) ""Little Caesar"", Cagney's great ""Public Enemy"" (1931), and Howard Hughes ""Scarface"" (1932). But Director George Hill and writer Frances Marion were at MGM where they made not only ""The Big House"", but also Min and Bill (1930) with Wallace Beery and Marie Dressler. Marion was also the writer for ""Anna Christie"" and ""Good News."" So this very un MGM film got made at MGM because the artistic talent was there.

The Big House was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, but it was beaten by ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Wallace Berry got the nod for Best Actor, but the award went to George Arliss in ""Disraeli."" But ""The Big House"" was the winner for Best Sound (Douglas Shearer) and Best Writing (Frances Marion). Marion was the first woman to win an AA for writing. How did a woman get to write a prison movie? Easy, She was married to the Director (George W. Hill).  But Marion's success was not attributable to her spousal arrangement alone. She was the favorite writer for such well known actors as Mary Pickford, Marion Davies, and Marie Dressler. In addition she won an Oscar in 1931 for ""The Champ"" (also with Wallace Beery).

(BTW - there is a 2000 movie entitled ""Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Power of Women in Hollywood"" with Kathy Bates as the voice of Marion)

The New York Evening Post said ""...it is Beery who runs off with the glory...he is the incarnation of a convict."" The Big House was so popular that Laurel and Hardy produced a spoof called ""Pardon Us"" in 1931. It was their first feature film, following literally dozens of two reelers for which they are best remembered. Walter Long does a terrific parody of Wallace Beery, and the blackface bit by Stan and Ollie remains hilarious to this day.

The film itself starts off like a documentary as we follow recently incarcerated Kent Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) through the introductory phases - talk with Warden (Lewis Stone), surrender of personal items, prison uniform, etc. Then Kent goes to his cell, a small sliver of space in which two convicts are already living - Machine Gun Butch Schmidt (Wallace Beery) and robber/forger John Morgan (Chester Morris).

Morris is best remembered for his Boston Blackie films starting in 1941. Robert Montgomery went on to host the popular ""Robert Montgomery Presents"" series on TV (in which Morris appeared) and to father Elizabeth, our favorite Samantha.

Lon Chaney was originally cast in the role of Butch, but his untimely death gave Beery a chance. Beery was in desperate need of a chance, his career in jeopardy after being released from his contract with Paramount and spending more than a year without a film offer. His role as Butch, coupled with ""Min and Bill"" the same year (also written by Marion and directed by Hill) and ""Billy the Kid"" (he played Pat Garrett), followed with the best actor award in 1931 for ""The Champ"" (also written by Marion) elevated Beery to the A list where he remained and made such memorable films as ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""Viva Villa"" (1934), and ""China Seas"" (1935). He continued to work through 1949, but his heyday was the 30s. Beery said of himself -""...my mug has been my fortune.""

The film shows us the boredom of prison life, the dangers lurking in the prison yard, the terrible dining arrangements (parodied by Leslie Nielson in Naked Gun), and the fearfulness of solitary confinement (there's great shot of Morris as the door is sealed and he merges with the darkness). The shots of mass movements, in and out of the court yard, up and down the stairs, etc. provide an excellent visage into prison uniformity.

There is a liberal bent to the Warden's explanation for the problems in prison (too little money and too many prisoners), and the guards are friendly and folksy. But that doesn't stop the Warden from calling in the tanks when a prison riot breaks out.

Crime was very much on everyone's mind in 1930, as witnessed by Warner Brothers' films with Robinson, Raft, and Cagney. The Roaring Twenties had come to an end and the Depression was only just being felt. Other popular crime films that year were Marlene Dietrich in ""The Blue Angel"", Howard Hughes' ""Hell's Angels"", Hitchcock's ""Murder"", King Vidor's ""Billy the Kid"" (also starring Beery), and ""Street of Chance"". The most popular movies of that year were ""All Quiet on the Western Front"",  ""The Big House"", ""Hell's Angels"", ""The Blue Angel"", and ""Animal Crackers"",

This film is well worth viewing. It gives us a moment in time of how people behaved and what life was like in 1930. It also gives us some great performances and, from an historical perspective, defines prison movies for the next century.
The sound is remarkable for 1930 as is the photography. George Hill's direction is sharp and to the point. His camera work varies from the prison scenes to the scenes in the community, helping give us a fuller feeling of what prison life must have been like.

(BTW - as originally written, the romance was between Morris and Montgomery's wife, but when they got bad reviews at a screening, Irving Thalberg had them re-write the script to make the woman Montgomery's sister rather than his wife. If you look closely, you'll see scenes that were original and scenes that were re-written)",1264291200,5,5876,4.787759131293188
559016,4,6303092012,"The Big House is a riveting prison drama with convincing acting that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very ending of the film! The casting is great; and the script, primarily written by Frances Marion, is brilliant. The cinematography and the choreography are very, very good as well. This may be an ""early talkie,"" but don't be fooled--the quality of the sound is actually quite good; I tip my hat to the other reviewer who notes that this got an Oscar for sound. There's some social commentary woven into the script but it's brief and rather similar to what we would hear today!

At the beginning of the film, Kent Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) gets thrown into prison for manslaughter; he accidentally ran over a man when he was driving drunk on New Year's Eve. Kent meets the prison warden James Adams (Lewis Stone) and his new cellmates, ""Machine Gun"" Butch Schmidt (Wallace Beery) and convicted forger John Morgan (Chester Morris). Right from the start we see and experience the prison environment: inmates bullying each other; people making elaborate plans for breaking out; others serving time in solitary which is completely dark and is referred to as ""the dungeon;"" and still more inmates trying to ingratiate themselves to guards and other prisoners to get favors and time reduced from their prison sentences--and the list goes on. Kent is overwhelmed although he makes friends with another prisoner named Oliver (Fletcher Norton) who tries to help him in his own way. As for Butch, he's one tough guy who murders and thinks nothing of it. To make things even more complicated, when Kent's sister Anne (Leila Hyams) comes to visit him, John Morgan takes one look at her and wants to make her his own, especially when John's lawyer tells him that he's getting early parole the next day. However, Kent makes trouble for John by planting a knife in John's bed just before John was to be released early on parole!

John actually manages to sneak out of jail (and, no, I'm not spoiling it by telling you how he manages THAT one); but he is recognized by Police Sgt. Donlin (Robert Emmett O'Connor). When John returns to prison again, he is under very strict supervision. While he was on the outside, however, John met and fell in love with Kent's sister Anne; and she began to feel the same way about him, too.

Things heat up in a big way when a huge prison break is planned for noon on Thanksgiving Day; Butch and several of his buddies are in on it. They know that if they fail they'll ""get the rope;"" but they are willing to take the gamble. Watch for a huge, extended and dramatic scene at the very end of the movie. Will they be able to get out or will at least some of them escape--and how will the prison guards hold back the 3,000 prisoners who are all suddenly rioting beyond belief? Who might get killed? Will John and Anne have any chance for a future together? No spoilers--watch and find out!

True, this ""Warner Archive"" DVD has no extras and the quality of the print is merely a high average (hence the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars); but don't let that turn you off. The Big House is an excellent early prison drama with impeccable acting. I recommend this film for people interested in prison dramas; and fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",1252713600,11,3333,4.587248322147651
559017,4,6303092012,"There were prison and gangster films during the silent era. ""The Godless Girl"" and ""Alias Jimmy Valentine"" are examples of such films before sound came along. However, sound gave such films an added dimension. ""The Big House"" is one of the earliest and best examples of the prison film during the sound era. It allows the din of human beings living on top of one another, the prison riot, and the armed escape attempt and stand-off to come to life. Add to this great performances by Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, and Robert Montgomery as inmates with Lewis Stone playing in support as the warden who wants to reform the men but is faced with the constraints of a low budget, and you have a great film. Seeing that stiff performances and static cameras were the norm in sound films just the year before in 1929, the technical accomplishments in this film coupled with its natural performances make it way ahead of its time for a 1930 film. The film did win the first academy award for sound, but it is an often forgotten cinema gem.

I give this film 5/5 stars for fans of the early talking picture, but I should warn you that the video is in somewhat shaggy shape. I have compared it to my old VHS tape and it is no worse than that, but no better either. So to say, as some have, that this is equivalent to public domain quality is not quite fair. The video is soft looking - just like some of the unrestored late MGM silents - and it has considerable dust and scratches but the contrast is good and details - such as facial features - are fairly clear. The Academy Award winning sound is still intact and the film sounds quite good. Because of this questionable video quality I bump my rating down from five to four stars.

559020,5,6303092012,"One of the first prison movies is still one of the best, thanks to great early performances by Chester Morris (Five Came Back, Boston Blackie) and Robert Montgomery (The Lady In The Lake, The Were Expendable), and the great Wallace Beery near the peak of his career.

The plot concerns three prisoners, a new one, Kent, sentenced to 10 years for manslaughter by drunk driving (Robert Montgomery), and two who've been serving long terms: gunman Butch (Wallace Beery) and robber/forger Morgan (Chester Morris, possibly in his best role ever).  Kent is yellow and carelessly betrays his new roommates out of sheer panic.  After escaping, Morgan looks up Kent's family with possibly vengeance on his mind, but is soon softened by Kent's pretty sister, hangs around too long and gets recaptured.  Back in the slammer Kent had convinced Butch he's not a stooly, and Butch and his gang have been planning an escape.  Upon returning, Morgan doesn't want to get involved in these matters, but ends up right in the middle.  The film climaxes with lots of action, as an attempted escape results in riot and a long gun battle, intensified by antique tanks.

The film has an expensive look for it's time; perhaps a special effects buff can tell me if the opening scene is a matte, animated, or just real.  They've done a good job of balancing the high production value with story, character, and acting; the latter showing the various ways prisoners accept their lot.

Butch is an interesting character, at once repulsive and ingratiating, constantly commiting small betrayals against his fellow inmates (stealing cigarettes, cheating, etc.), and redeeming himself with lines like ""Ah, I was only kiddin',"" delivered perfectly by Beery - of course he's perfect for the role.  Kent is bewildered by the hopeless situation he never expected to find himself in, his face a picture of fear varying from diffidence to panic.  Morgan is calm and collected,a regretful criminal with enough decency to accept his punishment, enough confidence to survive it.  The warden is played by Lewis Stone, best know as Judge Hardy, Andy Hardy's father.",1114560000,,2121,5.011396011396012
