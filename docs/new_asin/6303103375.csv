7839500,5,6303103375,"This DVD from 1989 is special. The Russian performers were a delight in their newness to me. Those performers whose talent is known here in the States were notable just for their presence even though they were approaching or past their prime. The younger participants were world class singers and showed it. Small problem: No bios or program notes of any sort. Overall, a best buy.",1262736000,,381,4.787878787878788
