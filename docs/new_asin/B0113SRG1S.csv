7324687,3,B0113SRG1S,"This is another ""Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" type of film. Gina (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) loses her her parents on the same day and blames Real Estate developer Parker Randall (Michael Woods). She becomes a live-in tutor for his step son (Reed Ramsden) so she can fulfill her dream of killing him.

This is a made for US TV film from 2012 called ""A Nanny's Revenge."" It is boring and the story develops very fast and unlikely until we get to the part where Gina is in their household. In the film her surname is Jensen, same as her soon to be ex-husband Mark (Paul Hopkins). On the credits it is Wright and on the IMDB write up it is Meyers. Her parents are named DiSalvo.

Made for TV film where women have a strong lead.",1445040000,,715,4.25

7324741,4,B0113SRG1S,"What a great low budget movie. Just a hundful of locations, a few houses, a workplace, a store, a restaurant, a park, and a hospital room. An occasional three second driving scene to show you someone is on the move. Camera angles, cuts, and audio were great and the flow of the story never got stagnant. Although the plot is not complicated, it's not really predictable which is why it held my interest all the way to the end. Watching a 007 movie you know it's not real because everything is over the top. With this movie everything seems so normal that it felt more ""real"" maybe like a docu-drama.
