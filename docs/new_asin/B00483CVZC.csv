8418536,5,B00483CVZC,"This is an outstanding concert by Helene Fischer in Berlin, Germany. She is twenty five years old and already a Germany music superstar. The songs are excellent and the performances are great. No one sings better than Helene Fischer! I strongly recommend this concert but you need a region-free DVD player for it to play.",1469750400,,321,4.8545454545454545
