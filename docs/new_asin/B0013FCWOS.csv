8250656,5,B0013FCWOS,I  should have cheked product description before ordering.  As I was surprised what the dvd entailed. That being said it is an encredible teaching dvd meticulously done. Barrios catecal and sor introduction and var are obviously advanced level. But one can learn so much about basic technique the way he goes through each piece isolating problem areas showing how to approach them. This dvd really shows how meticulous one should work on each problem. Highly recommend this dvd for the knowledge incripted in it. One can apply it to what ever level one is at...,1425859200,4,561,4.894736842105263
8250657,5,B0013FCWOS,Great dvd. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve on either of the pieces presented. Many of the ideas are translatable to general technique and interpretation as well. I wish there were more DVDs like this out there.,1401408000,3,230,4.775
