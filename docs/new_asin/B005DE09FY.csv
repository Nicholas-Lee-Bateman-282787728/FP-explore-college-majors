8466616,5,B005DE09FY,"The David Attenborough 3D documentaries that I have seen so far had all been demo quality and this one is no exception. It is an interesting film on why the reptiles took to the air, how they changed over time and why they disappeared. Seeing them in 3D is the closest we will ever get to appreciating how long they lived and how big they got. While I wouldn't want to see one in my tree, I found their whole history fascinating. David Attenborough is a great narrator and I would recommend others of his like the Kingdom of Plants and the Conquest of the Skies. If it  says SKY/3D, it is going to be demo quality.",1460505600,7,614,4.247863247863248

Note: You will need a 50Hz compatible display to play back 50Hz content with some of the above US players (eg. Panasonic DMP-BD60) or use a video processor to convert it to a compatible rate.

Other players (including the Samsung players) convert the content to another frame rate (eg. 60Hz) so they don't need a 50Hz compatible TV.
