4457142,5,B004R35DLW,"First, I will give away no spoilers. If you loved Series 1 and Series 2, you MUST see this one, and repeated viewings might be necessary. In my opinion, AWESOME! A little unsteady in the execution towards the last act(s), but HUGE just the same. Here's to what's ahead...............",1303257600,,283,4.795918367346939
4457143,5,B004R35DLW,"Our little gang has been through a lot in a small amount of time. Annie vanished after the 2nd season and Mitchell has an idea on how to get her back. Before that, however, a little matter has to be dealt with. Apparently the madness that Mitchell and Diasy undertook then is now known as the BoxTunnel 20, attributingh 20 deaths to the unknown. Mitchell and his mates move before more cna be established, and that leads to new things. More wolves, more vampires, a zombie, and some other surprises are in store, not to mention a little thing called Herrick and a Wolf-Shaped bullet. It gets interesting.

This season had a lot that a few didn't, and I think I like this development. In the beginning it was harder to plug into Annie and to Nina sometimes, but for different reasons. For men, Nina always seemed like a wrecking ball, and George always found himself under some debris she had pried loose. After the last season there was an opening, however, and the writers put her and George together in somewhat of a normal life. Other loves and relationships appear as well, and the house seems to have an energy to it. These cannot be left alone to develop, however, and things like a ghostly victim kind of cleach with a Boxtunnel killer.

Sometimes I am not a fan of complication, but I am that here.

Another beautiful thing is the addition of more supernatural. Two werewolves wander in and so do other vampires, and even a zombie. The way they come in is nice, too, and I like some of the things brought out by them. Before, every idea of the supernatural focused on the three housemates. You got some people in a pressure cooker of sorts, and you got some people trying out things that were ghostly - etc. This is different. While the zombie is a direct relation to something that happens, not everyone is. Some of the vampires simply exist, the wolves are, and so on. Couple this with some angry spirits and you understand a bunch.

The stories are, mostly, the best the series has had. When the idea of Annie is produced to the stuff between George and Nina, it was exciting. Even Karen and Herrick and other things oyu knew were coming do not come straight at you. Its nice and its fun. You see a lot of things behind the proverbial walls, showing you more of that world. Since all of them living together would be a new experience, it is interesting to watch - although some characters seem to think they are abover their prospective curses.

If I were going to note one real problem, I might say that I did not liek the ending and Mitchell in it. I know this builds him and shows his want to be humanlike, but he went a long way. FGranted, he is damaged and feels damned but he is only so self-destructive. Otherwise, he would not have gone 90 years or more. That said, it all does connect the roomies more, but the things that are said note how things will always be different. In some ways, I thought this was a little off.

If you want special features, you get a little from the set but not a lot. you asically have some talk, some deleted scenes, and a few things that are not that important - like trailers. Still, i liked the series a lot and am judging this on the notion that it is the show and how good it looks, not extra material, that matters. According, I have to give it a solid 5/5.",1302393600,13,3313,4.37012987012987
4457144,5,B004R35DLW,"Rating for show:
I came across this series by accident on BBCAmerica. We have the US version on SyFy now, but I have actually never seen it, so I will not attempt to make any comparison. In any case, if you're looking for a Buffy-esque series, this is not the show for you. This show actually has some great writers and a storyline so well-done it will hook you. The events and emotions are more realistic (and thus events may move a little slower), but you can't help but feel like these people could just be real (of course, minus the supernatural aspect). I don't know if it's the combination of good writing and a selection of good actors with a chemistry that just makes you care about these characters and their lives. (For me, that's saying something because I really have never cared to loyally follow a tv series before.) I've followed BBCs 'Being Human' series from the beginning of Season 1 and just saw the last of Season 3. (I was doubting how they'd do the show justice and pull 'it' off, but it was really well-done, which is why I'm bothering to write this review.) Anyway, my rating is a 5-star, hands down.

Rating for Video on Demand:
Awesome. I liked this show so much I was contemplating purchasing the DVD set, but I'm actually really happy with the video on demand option. It's more flexible. What I mean by that is I'm able to watch it on my laptop without any wireless connection, or if I'm not lugging my laptop around, you have the option of downloading it onto whatever portable device you own (though I think some restrictions apply to certain devices). OR you can watch it via signing into your Amazon account on another computer (ie, a great way to procrastinate at the library =).",1302393600,,1712,4.504823151125402
4457145,4,B004R35DLW,"The supernatural gang has left Bristol behind, but leaving the past behind is a little harder.

And ""Being Human Season 3"" is all about the bloody, terrifying past catching up to the main characters, whether it's an amnesiac vampire or a mass murder on a subway. The writers manage to throw some interesting curveballs into the characters' lives, but Aidan Turner's tormented vampire is the best part of it all.

Nina, George and Mitchell have purchased a small Welsh B&B as their new home, and everything seems potentially perfect... except Annie is trapped in purgatory, and she's headed for hell. Desperate to save her, Mitchell follows a newly-dead spirit into purgatory, where he is faced with his bloodiest sins -- and a prophecy that a ""werewolf-shaped bullet"" will kill him.

So the reunited gang continues trying to have a normal life, grappling with ""normal"" problems and supernatural ones, including a vampiric teenager, a tragic zombie, cage-fights, evil vampire suburbanites, and a pair of werewolves living in the woods. But things take a horrifying turn when George finds that Herrick has somehow come back to life -- and though he doesn't seem to remember who he is/was, he hasn't lost his evil. And after Herrick causes another horrifying incident, Mitchell's desperation will lead to another tragedy...

""Being Human Season Three"" might as well be called the ""Mitchell Season,"" because Aidan Turner really steals the show: Mitchell is tormented by the Box Tunnel Massacre, his fear of being caught, and his ever-growing terror of his impending death. Turner is absolutely sublime, slowly ramping up Mitchell's fear, desperation and erraticism as the season goes on, until it seems like the vampire is about to crack.

Not that the other characters get shortchanged, because they get plenty of attention too. Annie really blossoms when she begins an undead romance with Mitchell. George and Nina have to grapple with a very common problem when Nina becomes pregnant, and George also has to deal with his father's recent death.

And the writers make this season a pretty solid one, twisting together multiple dark storylines about revenge, hatred, suspicion and (of course) the Box Tunnel Massacre. It grows tenser and bleaker as the season goes on, and the seemingly-solid relationships between the housemates start to fray. And even the one-off plots seem to be a bit darker, although the vampire-teen one was hilarious. It finishes up on the single darkest episode of the whole series.

But there are some funny moments (George's repeated lament that ""I only wanted a pee!""), as well as some touching moments (Nina asking George if he wants to ""have a little hairy baby"" with her).

""Being Human Season Three"" just shows that even vampires and werewolves can't run away from their problems -- and when their problems catch up, things get messy.",1300147200,41,2863,5.076595744680851

The acting is superb in this series and that makes it easy to suspend our reservations and believe so easily.  In Season 3, Aidan Turner's portrayal of Mitchell, the vampire, kept me watching.  He's a wonderful actor and plays Mitchell as a tortured soul, who we can hate as a vampire, but love as a man who wants out so desperately from the hell he's been living for 100 or so years.

Mitchell is willing to do anything to get her back and more.  George and Nina relationship goes to new levels as they come to realize that they love each other and both help one another dealing  with the beast within them both.  Meanwhile were introduced to Tom and McNair father and son werewolves living in the new town that our heroes have taken up resident.

What the world doesn't know is Mitchell and Daisy were the ones who committed this crime.  Mitchell still dealing with this finds a way into purgatory and comes face to face with his past and future only to discover that his death will be in the form of a wolf shaped bullet.
  George and Nina discover she is pregnant and its clear she was transformed when the two of them consummated the pregnancy.  Can they come  to terms with the fact they could have a werewolf child on there hands?
  Annie meanwhile is doing  her best to enjoy what her death has to offer and realize that perhaps she may love Mitchell more then she imagined.

4457191,3,B004R35DLW,"As established in my reviews of seasons 1 and two, Being Human (UK) is really 3 shows with each being a backdrop to the others in sequence.  Seasons 1-3 is show 1, season 4 the second, and 5 the last.  Between them you have largely new cast (excluding carrying over Annie from 3 to 4) and another from the end of 3 through 4 and 5.  But there is no real story based relation, just individuals in episodes around who to continue the story of a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire living together trying to be human.  Season 3 does bring our initial cast to some closure on the story lines that have been developing in the 3 seasons.  Many big events are diminished, and other introduced but handled clumsily by the writers.  Mitchell's collapse was an interesting development, but hardly creative or shocking.  Maybe only the end of the season was a pleasant surprise yet a change to big to bring coherence to the overall series.  The show does ""play to a larger story"" than the US counter part when looked at overall, but that big story was handled in a portion of a few episodes hardly making it masterful writing.  I won't really know until I finish season 5 if watching this series was a waste of time and a complete disappointment but it has fallen short to date and I'm half way through the last season.  Just interesting enough to keep me watching but having been disappointed repeatedly without a lot of hope that it can do anything to become good in the last few episodes.  Of them all, Season 3 and 4 are the best.  But unlike the US version where when done I thought you just don't see it until it's all over, there just isn't that possibility with this version of the story.  This version is definitely filled with more horror, though the effects are poorer than the counterpart.  It is really just more bloody.  Ironically in the UK vampires don't have to drink blood where in the US if they don't they become catatonic and weak and just sort of exist without living/moving/doing anything.  Season 3 brings the story to some closure at its end and in the process wipes 2 of the 3 main characters from the story.  This is to much change in a show that in 5 years didn't come close to 40 episodes.  Very fragmented and fractured overall, but there are moments of entertainment.",1406332800,,2284,4.449519230769231

4457195,5,B004R35DLW,"It's not many TV shows willing to present characters in their true light and trust the audience to still follow them, but that's what Being Human 3 does. Mitchell is a vampire cohabiting with George (a werewolf) and Annie (a ghost). Mitchell's on the bloodsuckers anonymous wagon, but he falls off in spectacular fashion. George is desperate for a normal relationship and comes to terms with what that means for. Annie doesn't like her situation but accepts it and gains new control.

To say any more than that would be to ruin the arc of the story and it's heartbreaking but true to form ending. I watched all 3 seasons and this one is the strongest and most honest. The American remake is pale in comparison, and the following BBC Seasons don't quite measure up...mainly because the chemistry between Aidan Turner, Russell Tovey and Lenora Crichlow is so perfect.

The three are trying to be human, to stop being monsters. In their way of becoming humans the characters are developed to something much more than just a ghost, vampire and werewolf. They become persons who you'll like and hate at the same time. They manage to do the most important thing for a story - they make you relate to them. May be the best part about this series is the fact that you can see the personal dilemmas of every single character on screen, even from most of the minor characters. However, there are many funny moments to brake the ice, and believe me, the Brits know how to be fun.

4457234,5,B004R35DLW,"Just spend a few hours watching series 1 of this heartfelt and almost funny hit show from the BBC and then try to get down a whole episode of the US version and you will see how wildly different broadcast tv is between the UK and the US.

We almost never learn how to create a great show on broadcast tv in the States, and I presume it has something to do with committees, pressures from advertisers, and saddest of all, the incredibly low expectations the US audience has for what it considers worth watching.

If you honestly prefer the US version of ""State of Play"", ""Life on Mars"", ""Being Human"", then go click to the right where it says this review was not helpful.

We do occasionally produce winners all by ourselves instead of trying to massage a UK hit to please a 9th grade reading level audience with abominable tastes (""Reality TV"" has become a pun and an oxymoron!); we've given ""Fringe"", the first four seasons of ""West Wing"" and other Alan Sorkin masterpieces, an astounding reworking of ""Battlestar Galactica"" that transcends what we normally toss into the ScI-Fi genre but is actually a post-apocalyptic story about family, politics, even religions, and much less about laser beams and blowing things up, though there is plenty of that too, and a few other great shows: Haven, a surprising success based on a Stephen King short story, but without Showtime and HBO to keep us limping along, I think our TV industry would have gone the way of the music industry except for the unfortunate fact that too many of us find TV to be what we do after dinner. Nobody reads a great book as we once were capable of before the advent of the boob tube, with the exception of those among us who find the mindless cacophony of sitcoms, repetitious story lines and even a preponderance of bad acting (exceptions exist of course...I am certainly on a short rant here).

Check out the BBC's contributions to our own shows (Jason Isaacs in ""Awake"" is first to come to mind...and for a while ""House"", which has a great casting story behind it in that the casting director or show's director had no idea the star of that show wasn't from NJ and actually had to be subjected to a screen test!

We don't fare so well when we try to ape the various dialects in the UK...but is only fair to say that British, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ears are far more attuned to dialects in their regions, on the level of a Texan having a fairly good idea that someone from Brooklyn is from up North somewheres.

I'm an admitted Anglophile. No apologies when it comes to preferring the cultural gifts from across the Atlantic. Oh yes. One more example. Much as we adored the Kiefer Sutherland Saves Every Day Show for 8 years, why don't you (if you are still reading this) compare that predictable action toy to BBC's 9-10 series of MI-5, or ""Spooks"" as they know it. And look out for Idris Elba (bet you missed he's a Brit when you saw  ""The Wire"", right?) in just about anything you can find him...perhaps ""Luther"" and ""Ultraviolet (BBC)"" are a good start.

OK, I overstated my point and have managed to make myself both nauseated and nauseous. Go buy this series on DVD or watch it streaming on Amazon. You owe it to yourself if you haven't had the opportunity.  ""BEING HUMAN"" is superlative speculative fiction with family drama grounding the fantasy so well as to accept the convention that a werewolf and a vampire can share the home of a ghost and learn to love each other intensely.

This season is very intense and emotional.  The large overriding themes involve forgiveness and justice.  Can an individual really change their inherent nature?  Can other people forgive you for what you have done in your past?  Can you forgive yourself?  Can current good works make up for past evil?  Do you eventually have to pay a price for your past misdeeds?  All of these are questions that pervade this season. The answers, unlike most American shows, are not always full of sunshine.

It's funny, charming, has the right amount of drama, and suspense. And you got to give it to the brits: they are not afraid to be graphic, which in this case is quite refreshing.

4457256,4,B004R35DLW,"I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,
although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesses
have gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, story
lines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes that
seem a bit disconnected from the others.

And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,
and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem to
cry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are good
and evil in a complex world' seem to be less deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt'
'what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)

There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been stronger
as 5 or 6 episodes.

Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt to
find my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for a
lot of that, but not all of it.",1356998400,,1589,4.725631768953068

Things are falling apart at the end of the season and it is obvious we are coming to the point where major put off decisions need to be made (and they are).  If they had smoothed the drop a little more, this would have gotten 5 starts (it has 4.5 from me as it is).

4457261,5,B004R35DLW,"The third season is super dramatic and even tragic. It is the time of resurrection and sacrifice.

Annie is brought back to this world by John Mitchell from purgatory. She is back in the world she loves - as a ghost - and WITH the man she loves though she is rather limited along that line. But she assumes a power and an authority she should not even dream of, since she is a ghost. What right does she have to meddle with the affairs of the human world and what's more with the business of a vampire and the punishment he deserves for being a killer? If you don't want the man or the person you love to be a killer you better not love that person if he/she is a killer. But to reform a killer, especially a vampire, is like wanting the sun to rise in the west.

What's more that Annie becomes the easy prey of another dead ghost, one of the victims of John Mitchell's in the Tunnel Box 20 massacre, a student in the real world when she was alive, who is absolutely exclusively leaning towards vengeance, trying to bend the world of the living towards her own ends and predicting that Mitchell will be killed by a werewolf, though she knows she has no foreseeing power. How could she since she was not even able to avoid taking the train that was going to lead to her death. Once a seer forever a seer but if you are not a seer from the very start you will never be a seer ever ever.

George, the werewolf, and his enamoured Nina, find their life very complicated when Nina discovers she is pregnant with a monster that was impregnated into her on a full moon episode, and when in their adventures they get to know and help two other werewolves who are hunted by vampires and particularly the band of Herrick's aficionados - a Herrick who is officially dead, killed by George by dismembering, which is not kosher for a vampire - because the two werewolves killed quite a few of these vampires, well more than a few, quite a lot indeed. But we will find out that Herrick is a bloody torturer, organizing dog fights between human beings and werewolves on full moon nights. That way a certain McNair wins but is scratched by the werewolf he kills and becomes a werewolf himself. That's life of course: one cannot win on all sides at the same time. There is always a flaw in the beautiful picture of a victory. But this McNair is important because of the ""son"" he brings into the picture, a young man who was made a werewolf some time in Scotland and this Tom McNair is a very effective vampire killer especially when Herrick kills his ""father"".

That's one of the twists of this third season: Herrick who was not properly killed with a stake in his heart, but dismembered by George comes back full and healthy though without his memory. But he will recapture that one and then will become an avenging vampire, but he will fail getting a fight between George and Mitchell, thanks to Tom McNair and then John Mitchell will have to do what was not done properly before: never entrust to anyone what you can and should do yourself, because that's cowardice and totally misguided because your substitute will never do things properly, that is to say the way you would like them to be done.

But all that is brought up by the insistence on the side of a female inspector or someone/something in a police uniform to arrest John Mitchell for the Tunnel Box 20 massacre. She will succeed as for that but then a real massacre will ensue because that will trigger Herrick's recovery of his memory.

The last point here is that the series tried to widen the scope and bring the Old Ones into the picture, the vampires who are more than one thousand years old. They want to recuperate John Mitchell as something like their killing Cerberus and the confrontation is dramatic. John Mitchell wants George to kill him. The representative of the Old Ones wants to recuperate John Mitchell. George does not want to kill John Mitchell but he cannot let him become a killing machine in the hands and at the tips of the fangs of a bunch of old cronies who want to declare the age of the vampire finally reached and the authority of vampires over the whole world finally achieved.

But George Sands loves John Mitchell and he cannot eternally hide his head in the sand of some desert: his dilemma is between loving and killing, not killing because loving and killing because loving. Can one kill someone because they love them? That's the dramatic last scene or nearly of the third season. Will John Mitchell crumble into ashes or not? But this love scene between two ""men"" is absolutely marvellous in intensity and yet modesty: two men can love each other that intensively and yet keep that love where it belongs first of all and above all, in their soul, in their mind, in their mental spiritual force and power.

If he does kill John Mitchell the future of the series is bleak and will require a miracle to undo what love has brought up. If he does not all morality and ethics are out of this perverse series that becomes the melting pot of all crimes in the name of love.

You choose your favourite solution and you enjoy that suspense.

The episodes seem disjointed, there is no consistent theme, or plot, to the season until near the end and it seems that the writers are just throwing things at the audience to keep us busy until they can come up with a storyline.
The series begins with a couple of one-off episodes to introduce the new sets that they have built and to let us know that our heroes have moved to Barry Island in Wales, but those episodes are largely uninteresting and barely connected to the rest of the series.
The behavior of the characters in this season makes little or no sense in the context of the world in which they live and the behavior of the ghost, Annie, particularly in the later episodes, is senseless in the extreme. Once again, plot driven stupidity is used as an excuse to move forward a story that is barely worth telling.
If I were you, I would forgo Series Three and just watch the second season again.",1334016000,,1137,4.367924528301887

4457264,5,B004R35DLW,"While I was rewatching all three seasons of the UK version of this awesome show (yet again), comparisons to the SYFY version were inevitable. Frankly, there are loads of them, and the Americans lose THIS Revolutionary War every time, hands down. I realized a couple of things. Past, of course, that I have adored the characters and the relationship between Mitchell, George, and Annie for three years already, I saw that mainly what is missing in the US version is the UK's SENSE OF HUMOR! You laugh as much as you are terrified (well, not really). George barging into the vampire HQ and yelling ""Who wants some of my chair?!"" while Annie stands behind him is just one of my favorite ""George moments..."" and there are a lot of them(""You smell like a Polo...Do you have a hole?"" from S1 Ep1)...I realized that I have come to really, really like these actors, and the way they are written. I agree with the reviewer who said that they are all three perfect in their parts. (and yes, Leonora Crichlow is a slammin hottie, but so is Aiden Turner!) Who's lame idea was it over at the SyFy Network to re-vamp (bad pun) this show for American audiences? Do they not think we can get the humor? Not understand the lingo? Would they have used subtitles (like they do on Ghost Hunters when people have the audacity to speak with Irish or Australian accents)? It just will never equal this show. **SPOILER ALERT SEASON 4** I was sad to see George, Mitchell AND Nina all go from this show. It feels like the end of an era--albeit a rather too-short era. And oh, yeah...So, let me get this straight. The vampire in the SyFy version is actually CALLED Aidan? Was that a nod to Aidan Turner? Because I don't really think too many Revolutionary War-era families named their kids a modern name like Aidan, unless they were ACTUALLY Irish...And he doesn't seem to be. Sam Witwer should stick with doing voice-overs for Darth Maul, and leave the vampiring to someone who is an ACTUAL hot actor. Well, George...Mitchell...Nina...So long, and thanks for all the fish.

4457265,5,B004R35DLW,"Love this series, hated to see Mitchell killed off but looking forward to the Hobbit Movie where he plays Kili.

In my opinion the BBC show is better than the US show, which lacks some of the humor and character interaction.  I like the way the characters care for each other (almost like siblings with the bickering but also the love and concern), I don't get the same feeling about the characters in the US shows.

I do watch the US shows just since Toby W. is involved but wish I saw more of his influence.

I have all three seasons of the BBC shows and have watched them several times.  I strongly recommend the show and encourage US viewers to check it out I think they will be pleasantly surprised.

4457267,5,B004R35DLW,"My review on the show itself.....
Being Human, all seasons so far, is a completely unique show. This show offers drama, action, and suspense mixed with some dark British humor and some sex appeal. What's not to love?

And on the other hand, my review for the DVDs.....
I have loved this show since the odd pilot aired that had a few different cast members. I first watched the Being Human Seasons one, two, and three on UK's BBC. I went to watch them on BBC America, and a lot is edited out. Because I loved the original shows I saw, I decided to order them on DVD (hoping they would not be edited). Nevertheless, I was shocked and disappointed when I ordered them in Region 1 US DVD Format. I found that the available US Format is put out by BBC America and that the BBC America versions are completely edited. The US Format DVDs for this show lose a lot of the British Humor due to editing (US censorship-Go Figure).

So, I guess I will be buying a Region Free DVD Player and trying to find a Region 2 UK Format Version, hopefully the unedited British version with the curse words, sex scenes, and nudity left in. I loved BBC shows, and I wonder if I'm the only American who noticed when we got switched to BBC America (a poor comparison to the actual British Network that we lost).",1326499200,14,1284,4.323651452282157

Toby Whithouse is a genius he takes his time in exploring the characters and their stories, yes there's less episodes but better story lines. It's too much of a copy the US version and rushes through the stories and doesn't allow for the character development. It's not as gritty or brilliant either ok stories but I will stick with my original love being human uk.

The actors are better and I am sorry but I hate sally i find her way too annoying! I understand they are trying to create their own version and get past the UK to make new stories by having all three seasons of the Uk version happening in one, but if they really wanted to do that they shouldn't of copied and pasted all the stories from the UK version and rearrange them and add a few extra tidbits and dialogue inbetween.

I say stick with the original and watch all three series through not just an episode or two before you make your decision. Being Human UK is the best!!!!

4457276,5,B004R35DLW,"**Spoiler Alert. There may be spoilers here, so if you want to remain a Being Human ""virgin"", don't read below.

It is a little tough watching the American version knowing that the BBC version is not only in its 3rd series, but the BBC version is more original simply for having set the stage for SYFY.

Don't get me wrong, the American actors are fine and their performances are great, but the british cast ""own"" these roles. It's almost like the Americans are renting theirs. The BBC characters seem more fallible, more realisting, and belong to their roles. It is like the BBC wrote characters to best suit the actors, and in the SYFY version, they did the opposite, but to a somewhat disconcordant effect.

That sounds more negative then it is intended, but I did not like the twist at the end of the American season when the werewolf Josh (played by Sam Huntington) is hoodwinked into sitting out the grande finale battle royale. Perhaps the SYFY ending was more fitting, as it felt truer to the logic of their universe.

Case in point, a man of twenty-something has very little chance of outfoxing a man of 300 who is perpetually on his toes and a master of his powers (SYFY). What the BBC version suggested is that in the heat of combat both 150-something Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and Herrick [an ancient vampire with full acceptance (and thus, control) of his powers and senses; played by Jason Watkins], are duped by the silly, often-unwieldy George (played by Russel Tovey), one into making ready for a battle royale that will never happen, and the other getting locked in the basement with the werewolf. Herrick HAD to see that coming.

In this BBC season-concluding episode, there is faithfulness to each performance and plot that is rarely seen in this type of horror/sci-fi drama.

Oh, and Lenora Crichlow is a slamming hotty. Meaghan Rath seems a far more morose, whiny version of the ghostly-friend. I would rather spend eternity with a chipper Annie and her endless tea-making than Sally-sulks-a-lot, moping and pouting. That would drive me bonkers. If Sally doesn't cheer up in season 2 of SYFY, I'm not sure if I can stomach it.

Kristen Hager has better looks than Sinead Keenan. That's all I have to say on that matter. It feels like each series picked the correct actress to play across from their dopey werewolf roomie. Still, Nina seems a little more realistic in the role because she's not physically perfect. She is charming, and has a flair for the character. Kristen is believable as a young doctor in Boston, although I can't quite place why her character would hang around with Josh. I think given their dispositions, the only thing keeping these two characters together is the script.",1307836800,,2714,4.761702127659574

But there will be no more blood for Mitchel as his BFF, George, finds the  courage to release Mitchel from a bondage of cravings and cruel elders who have played him for years. A false prophecy set into motion by one of Mitchel's vengeful victims becomes self-fulfilling in Season 3, the grand finale of Being Human.

There is no current or past TV series (in my memory) so adept at elaborating a novel premise (that is, an adoptive family of monsters striving to be human against their unwanted evil heritage), and doing so with a perfect balance between comedy and horror, base  instinct and higher reason.
