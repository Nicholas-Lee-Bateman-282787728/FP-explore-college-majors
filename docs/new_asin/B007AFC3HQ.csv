8513319,1,B007AFC3HQ,"Terrible.  Boring interviews, nothing new here.  A big disappointment considering how good those other documentaries (Tammy Faye) are.  Just because it's gay doesn't mean it's good; for example, Greg Araki's films are awful; so what if the people in them are gay.  Make a good film, not a political statement.  If you really want to see this film, try to see it on cable or Netflix, if they have it.  Don't waste $20 on it.  I returned it and got a refund.",1337817600,,456,4.487804878048781
8513320,5,B007AFC3HQ,"""When I Knew"" is a documentary that recently aired on Cinemax/HBO that recalls the moments when LGBT people first realized they were different. I watched it when it aired and I was completely mesmerized by the stories. Some are very funny (the boy who loved watching Little Mermaid to the boy obsessed with the Dogan's pill box man) while some are sad but relatable (the story where a father tells his son what gay really means. I won't spoil it for you). Regardless, the movie boasts a powerful collection of stories that are poignant and relatable. Recommended for people who are lost in their identity or just want to reminisce about coming out stories. My only complaint was that it was short! LOL

""When I knew is not a moment anyone quickly forgets. It's the moment someone realizes (he or she) is radically and unacceptably different from friends and family. For many of us, it is the moment we learn to hide and to lie about ourselves. It can be a lonely and frightening time."" -from ""When I Knew"" filmmaker Randy Barbatos",1214611200,7,1030,4.65934065934066
