1711990,5,B000066751,Absolutely brilliant! Anime unlike any other of its genre. Don't mistake His and Her Circumstances as romantic fluff because of its title or shoujo character-design. This series is thought provoking and more than a little disturbing in its truthful depiction of real life relationships. I would recommend this for any anime fan who enjoys insightful stories and well developed characters. The entire cast is great. This is Neon Genesis Evangelion stripped of sci-fi and brought down to Earth.,1026950400,3,492,5.32051282051282
1711991,5,B000066751,"I first read about His and Her Circumstances(Kare Kano) in Animerica, and decided to watch it. I didn't know what to expect exactly as I settled down to watch it, but I was just absolutely blown away.
Kare Kano is probably the most realistic show I have seen ever. Me and my boyfriend were talking about how much of each other we could see in the characters. Unlike other shows about teenage love that give you some outdated third person cutesy perspective, Kare Kano puts you in the characters' heads. It shows you the agony and angst, the bewilderment and joy that you felt at that age.
Once I finished episode one, I watched all six episodes at one sitting. It was just that good. I would highly recommend this show to anyone, not just anime fans.",1026691200,2,750,4.481751824817518
1711992,5,B000066751,"As one of the fans of Anime and Manga, His and Her Circumstances is really a must! Funny and love stories are always put in every sections while we also find ""important meanings"" in the story. Beautiful and simple plot has been used with a perfect animation.....
Finally, this DVD is highly recommended to have as a collection.",1026259200,,327,4.655172413793103
1711993,5,B000066751,"From the creators of the monsterously popular ""Neon Genisis"" and ""Furi Kuri"" comes an anime that's completely different. Kare Kano (his and her Circumstance) tells the story about High School Student Miyazawa, who thrives on praises. #1 in her class, elegent, smart and always friendly, Miyazawa has it all. However, her whole School image is a fake. She's really lazy, selfish, tempermental and weird.
Everything is going fine for Miyazawa untill someone sweeps in and takes everything she built up away. Arima, the new student, is smart, helpfull and #1 in his class. So what will happen when he discovers Miyazawa's little secret?
With great storylines, crazy characters, catchy music, and a romance that can't be beat, Kare Kano is one of the best romantic comedy anime i've seen in years (with the exception of Maison Ikkoku)
With Veronica Tailor (from slayers and pokemon) and Lisa Ortez (from slayers, magic users club, gall force, pokemon, utena, and matel legend) at the helm of the english track, there's no telling what's gonna happen.",1025827200,,1046,5.087209302325581
1711994,5,B000066751,"HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES is usually described as a romantic-comedy with the story revolving around two overacheiving High School Students.  Sounds sappy, sentimental, and common, right?  Well it's not.  And it's not just for girls - the creators of the action-scifi anime NEON GENESIS EVANGELION created this animated drama.
First of all, the pacing is frenetic and HILARIOUS.  You'll find yourself laughing at every episode - but what's the most amazing thing is: 1. It's funny because it's true. 2. They still are able to stop the comedy to show the drama (and sometimes they can do it without stopping the comedy).  It makes you laugh and I'd be surprised if you don't shed a tear or two, either (yes - even the guys).
It's also an insightful and realistic tale of growing up and finding out what love is as they follow the characters through all the phases of relationship.  From the first time you realize you like them, to the friendship, to the first kiss, even to the first sexual experiences - and it's done in a mature, realistic and touching manner.
Best friends, no friends, rivals, love, crushes, confusion, lonliness, pretending, laughs, shopping, dreams.  This one has it all.  It's deep but entertaining at all times.  One of the best animes out there (unless you're as shallow as a puddle.)",1023667200,37,1308,4.829596412556054
1711995,5,B000066751,This anime has a plot just like sana and hayama (kodomo no omocha),1022457600,3,66,4.153846153846154
1711996,5,B000066751,"When I first saw this series it had been given to me as something I just had to watch.  I personally had never even heard of Kare Kano, but I figured I might as well give it a try.  I started the first episode and I was like, hmm this is pretty good, interesting story line, some humor too, so I kept watching.  By the time I got to the third episode I was hooked.  The show really is great, you're almost always left wondering what's next, sitting on the edge of your seat, intensly watching for what is to be the next major plot twist.  It definitly delivers a great performance, from graphics, to the music, to the characters and thier plot.  If you're considering this, I would definitly reccomend that you quit your hesitation and order this now.  You won't regret it later.",1019865600,6,779,4.3310344827586205
1711997,5,B000066751,"This is one of those rare anime series that is able to capture both serious moments of romance and drama one moment and still be completely wacky and funny the next.  The best part about this show though is the characters.  This show has some of the best character development I've ever seen.  All of the characters (even the supporting ones) are explored well beyond just the surface.  A good example of this is Tsubasa and Maho (neither of who are introduced in this DVD unfortunately), who start out hating the main character and trying their best to ruin her (although both in different ways).  However they both have reasons for feeling the way they do and eventually they become friends.  I'm really glad to see that this series if finally getting the commercial translation that it deserves (now if only we could get Hana Yori Dango as well).  And for anyone who is interested in a funny romantic anime series, I then this DVD should not be passed up.",1019606400,2,958,4.6
1711998,5,B000066751,"Beware: Karekano (the series nickname in Japan) IS NOT your usual romantic anime. Gone are the silly relationships between the likes of Belldandy and Keichi, or the excess of sugar of the likes of Miaka and Tamahome, so this is a title that is different from what both shoujo and shounen anime fans are used to watch. Thankfully.
  While a shoujo series, Karekano can be easily watched by both shoujo AND shonen fans, as there's something for everybody. What makes it so different? First, the relationship between Arima and Yukina is something that you would expect to see in real life, both of them look perfect on their own way until you get to know them better, so you see that they're just regular humans, living a regular life on a regular city. Just like you and me. No girls coming out the TV or descending from heaven, or pretty boys that saves the girl who just fall in love for her. Even the characters are not depicted as God's gift for beauty on earth, so that's a change.
  After Yukina starts noticing Arima (in the worst way possible), they start a hate relationship that actually leads to a romantic affair and turns them into boyfriend and girlfriend. Many would argue what's so special on this. It is the daily routine, the chalenge of staying close with all other things to do, friends and their problems, school and jealousy. And above all, that abstract thing that is love, something that's not for sure, that you can feel but you can't put it in a safe and claim yours forever. And at this point, Karekano turns out to be the best romantic animated series ever.
Produced at Gainax and directed on it's first 12 episodes by legendary Hideaki Anno (which seems to have overdone it this time) and for the rest of the series by the director of Nadesico and the staff at Gainax, this is a clear example that it's not only great animation that counts for doing a great series. You simply have to watch to understand it.
Later in the series the staff even does some experimental animation, which some will regard as bizarre, for me they where cool, and for an episode or two, they sure add some fresh air to the whole animation scene. Of course, later these guyus would work on FLCL, and the exeperience on this series has proved to be effective.
If all your life as as anime fan you have asked yourself on why romance on anime was always on platonic level, then Karekano is the answer to this question.",1019001600,27,2418,4.513698630136986
1711999,5,B000066751,"Words cannot describe how much I love His and Her Circumstances.  This series was responsible for turning me on to shoujo (girl's) anime, and I still believe it is the finest example of it's type yet made.
His and Her Circumstances is the story of Yukino Miyazawa, a high school student who prides herself on being the number one student in every way.  But this is only a facade. She is really just putting on an act, secretly putting all of her energy into seeming like she is the ""perfect student"".  Her world comes crashing down when Souchiro Arima joins the school.  He quickly begins to give her a run for her money, and becomes her competition.  But soon, she realizes that she actually has feelings for him, and... well I don't want to spoil the story.
His and Her Circumstances was created by Studio Gainax, who needs no introduction.  As it was directed by Anno Hideaki, fans of Evangelion will note constant references to that series, usually hilarious, despite how completely different the two shows are.  But the most amazing thing about this series is how experimental it all is.  The animation is done almost in the style of a living comic book, which is something I have not seen before.  Characters art switches at random from completely silly to serious and downright beautiful.  One episode midway through the series is even done in paper cutouts on popsicle sticks!  Of course, in the much later episodes, the studio began to run out of money, resulting in an abundance of still-frames, but this is only a minor complaint.  Just as in FLCL (another essential anime purchase), I was constantly guessing as to what tricks the director would pull next.
  Beyond all of this however, The characters in His and Her Circumstances feel much more real than in your standard ""Does he like me? Does he like me?"" story.  And as Arima's and Yukino's relationship progresses, their real personalities reveal themselves.  There are a few great side stories too (my favorite involving the young-looking Tsubasa).  Overall, I can't say enough good things about this series.  It's a brilliant mix of comedy, romance, and drama, and my favorite anime of all time.  Every anime fan must see it, and I think it's a perfect addition to any film library.",1018656000,38,2251,4.7700258397932815
1712047,5,B000066751,"Forget anything negative you've read about Gainax's His and Her Circumstances. All the characters are wonderful, even funny at many points, and it's a DVD, I have never gotten tired of watching over and over again. It's a recommended buy, trust me.",1078358400,,248,4.928571428571429
1712048,3,B000066751,"As an artist I learned a lot from watching this series. I found His and Her Circumstances entertaining and engaging, with moments of true brilliance, particularly in the humor. I can see this title appealing particularly to middle-and-high schoolers and it does a great job of capturing something about those times.
Artistically there is a good amount of experimentation - it's clear that at this point Gainax is moving towards the dramatic and unique style that emerges in Fooly Cooly. If you are a fan of FLCL you will probably dig H&Hc as well, and vice versa.
However, if you are going to follow these series you shoulf be forwarned. First there is a LOT of filler and recycling of animation. It's not too bad in the first two DVDs but then expect to run into entire episodes which are re-edits of existing footage. Re-caps of the story are ok... but doing it over and over to the point of retelling the entire series is cheap.
Worse, there are episodes which are basically just cleaned-up animatics, complete with drawings cut out and pasted on sticks and moved around on video, and tons of pan-and-scans of sketches. This is pretty clearly a way to turn out content without going through the effort and expense of full ink-and-paint. Gainax tries to sweep this under the rug by being ""artistic"" about it, and you CAN get away with some of that in the name of art perhaps but essentially we have here about 3 DVD's worth of content stretched out to 5.
Additionally as occured in Evangellion the ending is fatally flawed. The storyline is cut off in the middle of nowhere, and pasted over with a putty consisting of psychobabble and a healthy dose of screw you it's over. This is particularly frustrating because the entire series builds up a few subplots which are left totally unresolved.
For instance Arima, the male protagonist, is hinted at having a black temper and murderous jealousy over Yukino, and the last few episodes play this up to an intensity that makes you wonder if the guy is actually a monster. Pretty heavy for a series that started out with the most serious conflict being Yukino getting the silent treatment from her classmates.
So, I'd really have liked to give His and Her Circumstances more stars. I really enjoyed watching it for the most part. But as was the case with Evangellion the story fragments and goes everywhere at once before finally being cut off the way a farmer might put down a rabid dog. Its a shame. Still, get the frist two DVDs and you will have hours of enjoyment.",1066780800,11,2515,4.653932584269663
1712049,5,B000066751,"Okay, my anime freak boyfriend was making me watch all this stuff like Golden Boy and Cowboy Bebop (which are very good...just not girl stuff) But it wasn't until Love Hina and this wonderful DVD came along that I really got into anime.  Yukino and Arima are adorable!!!  Think back to all your first crushes and boy or girlfriends, and that's this dvd right here.  Beside the fact that the Arima and Yukino's voices sound like they're 21 instead of ninth graders, the voice talents are great as well.  Plus Arima is a total Hottie for a cartoon character.  and all the characters have LESM syndrome which is just sooooo... CUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE.
  Be sure to watch this one with your girlfriend/boyfriend!!",1066262400,2,702,4.8
1712050,5,B000066751,"Adapted from a bestselling manga of the same title, this 26-part TV series was unfortunately never finished (based on reports I've read) but delivers, for its first entry, laughs, eye candy, and delightful entertainment considering its from the folks who made NEON GENESIS EVANGELION (as well as NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER).
This is not an action-adventure story set in 1880's Europe, or a (literally!) mind-bending drama in apocalyptic, war-torn Japan, but rather a modern day story about two High School students who learn to see each other behind their masks and find the perfect friend -- and love in each other.  Popular and brainy on the outside but a sneaky, manipulative slob on the inside, Yukino Miyazawa has ALWAYS been the top student in school... until she is ""displaced"" by Souiichirou Arima, a soft-speaking young man who struggles to maintain perfection for his family's honor.  Jealous of his popularity and successes, Miyazawa plots to get even and eventually manages to top him on the next exam.  But Miyazawa's world is turned even further upside down when Arima confesses that he is in love with her!  Freaked out, she tries to neglect him, but he sneakily wins her over by blackmailing her into doing his homework for him!  The story of how these two ""flawed"" characters learn about each other and change as a result of their many meetings is moving... and it's also a lot of fun.
What makes the show so entertaining is the style of the artwork and the execution.  HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES isn't just a straightforward drama, but full of deliberately exaggerated cariacture drawings of our protagonists' ""real selfs"", manga-style drawings, contradicting subtitles (in Japanese), pencil-drawings, and a lot more stuff that will have you on the floor.  I honestly didn't expect to be laughing so hard, but I was.  And, by the time the first volume came to a close, I was disappointed that it ended so soon.
For all its offbeat artwork style, the characters are not cliched exaggerations but real people.  Arima is a young boy who is soft-spoken and friendly but also clever and cunning -- unlike Jean, who much too good a guy to do anything mean or hurtful, or Shinji, who is just too shy -- Arima is active and flawed.  Yukino is flawed, too -- she lies about being the ""greatest student in High School"" while being expressive with her envy, hatred, and finally romantic feelings.  Like most of GAINAX's heroines, she is also quick-tempered -- but unlike Nadia, whose bratty tantrums felt infuriating considering 1) that Jean did nothing to deserve them, 2) that she's basically much nicer than that to him for a large majority of the show, and Asuka, who was just so nasty that she ended up being unlovable IMO -- Yukino's rages are deliberately exaggerated and funny.  Plus, the entire story is told from her point of view... at first.  Not only that, the characters actually TELL us what's really going on in those twisted little minds of theirs.  This is another big plus to the show, considering that director Hideaki Anno seems to have trouble understanding relationships.  (An article said this series was a study of relationships for him.  Hopefully he'll learn a thing or two from this!)
Although it is too bad that the show never got finished (mainly because the creators were frustrated at the ""limitations"" of animation), the parts that are good -- like much of GAINAX's works, it seems -- are treasures (indeed, the first eight episodes and last episodes of NADIA -- as well as Nadia at her nicest to her friends are precious to this reviewer, as are some of the sequences in EVANGELION).  This first volume is one of those treasures, and it deserves to be seen.
The DVD is extensively presented -- and excellent.  The video quality is exquisite, the audio on both English and Japanese (I spot-checked this track) are solidly mixed, the menus are fabulous, and the subtitles and alternate angle options of switching back and forth between Japanese and English made titles, are clever.  The only downside is that, on my DVD player, each time I try to switch the ""alternate angle"", there is a brief pause that occurs before it happens.  Does anyone else have this problem?
There are also extensive liner notes on the DVD that are intriguing to read.
As for the dub?  I love it!  It uses many actors who lent their voices to RECORD OF LODOSS WAR (Lisa Ortiz, Crispin Freeman, Pete Zarustica, Ted Lewis, and others) and they do a really cool job with their parts.  On a side note, I purchased the first volume (and DVD box set) at an Anime convention in New York where I met voice actress Veronica Taylor, who voices Miyazawa -- and, like many of the fans who were on line, I got her autograph.  And she was a treat to talk to (in other words, a really, really nice person)!  Plus, she nails Miyazawa spot on throughout what I saw of this volume.  She said she had a lot of fun recording Miyazawa's lines... and it shows.  Another role she's known for is Ash Ketchum of POKEMON, but I think this is her best role ever.  And meeting her was a wonderful experience for me.
Sorry about that being off-topic, but this is just another compliment to how much I really got a kick out of this volume.  Chances are you will, too.",1062892800,3,5256,4.707423580786026
1712051,5,B000066751,"Don't spend extra for the box. I wholeheartedly recommend buying the Volume 1 and 2 DVDs and give them five stars
However, the show's quality drops further than I would have dreamed possible. Ask anyone who's seen the depressingly poor episode 19.
The first two volumes comprise the best of the show, and episode 10 is a fine place to stop.",1060300800,8,340,4.590163934426229
1712052,4,B000066751,"""His and Her Circumstances"" (aka ""Kare Kano"") is a 26-episode anime TV series from the studio (Gainax) and director (Hideaki Anno) who'd previously brought us ""Neon Genesis Evangelion."" Like the earlier series, it's a turbulent tale of adolescence, but with a much lighter tone and absolutely no science fiction or supernatural elements. Its basic premise derives from the mutual attraction of two high-achieving tenth-graders-Yukino Miyazawa, a middle-class girl, and Soichiro Arima, a well-to-do boy. Both have problems reconciling their highly polished public facades with their more insecure private selves. Yukino has a frenetic home life involving two eagerly interested younger sisters (who function as a sort of Greek Chorus) while Arima is an only child with a more restrained home life in a large house where he lives with an aunt and uncle who are his adoptive parents. It all adds up to a thoroughly engaging mix of drama, comedy, laughter and tears.
What makes the series so distinctive, aside from the depth of its emotions, is its freewheeling visual imagination. Characters frequently revert to cartoon/comic strip form to express strong feelings. The frame frequently changes in size and scope. Regular ""reenactments"" are staged like theater pieces, with dramatic stage lighting. Visual metaphors are frequently used, including traffic lights, dripping faucets and street signs (e.g. ""Under Construction"" to describe the two teens' budding friendship). Text, both Japanese and English, appears on screen so often that non-Japanese-speaking viewers may want to watch this the first time with the English track on, so as not to have to contend with additional blocks of text occasioned by the subtitles.
The voice acting is masterfully done by both the Japanese and English-language dub casts. On the DVD, the two actresses in each cast who play Yukino's sisters are seen in alternate preview segments telling us what's coming next. The English voice cast is led by Veronica Taylor (""Pokmon""'s Ash) as Yukino and includes such other highly respected vocal performers as Christopher Nicholas, Jessica Calvello, Megan Hollingshead, and Rachael Lillis.",1059955200,,2164,5.462686567164179
1712053,5,B000066751,I thought it was cool to make an anime story into a every day teen life. The art in this anime is different form other animes. This makes it very entertaining to watch and it is funny. I can't what until the last two dvds come out. I recomend this to anime fans.,1056758400,,262,3.9622641509433962
1712054,5,B000066751,"Karekano is a very special series. On the surface it's a classic gakuen (school-life) anime, depicting the lives of high school students in a typical Tokyo suburb. Some of the difficulties they go through - such as when a teacher actually tries to stop their budding romance because he sees it as interfering with their studies - are very Japanese indeed. High school students who want to do well as Yukino and Soichiro do must study for unbelievably long hours (by the standards of high school students in any other country). There are also episodes later on in the series that depict ""ijime"" (bullying on various levels), endured by Yukino from her classmates, as well as by Soichiro from his unfeeling relatives. The reasons for which they are persecuted are uniquely Japanese in many ways.
Beyond that though, the series is also absolutely hilarious, as well as being one of the best depictions of teenage romance you're likely to find anywhere. The teenagers here are depicted as fully rounded characters instead of archetypes - each one with his/her unique hopes, fears, desires, and conflicts. This raises it well above most series in this genre.
On a personal note,  the series made me quite nostalgic for my high school days in Japan. I see a lot of my 16-year old self in Yukino. (yes I was a swot and goody-two-shoes like her...)
One caveat is that the ending of the series was a bit abrupt (and it also looks like somewhere along the way they ran out of money or something, causing the animators to use lots of static images). If you want to know what happens to Yukino, Soichiro, Hideaki, Tsubasa and the rest of the gang, try to get a Japanese friend to read you the manga version, which is still being serialized (and is even more intriguing than the early chapters depicted in the anime series).",1055376000,2,1811,4.69496855345912
1712055,5,B000066751,"When I first purchased this dvd I wasn't sure it was for me.  This is the type of story normally reserved for younger girls dreaming of meeting Mr. Right.  However, in short order it convinced me I was wrong.
This dvd tells the story of a young woman who appears, on the surface, to be the perfect student.  In reality she is self-centered, arrogant, and a sore loser.  When a young man suddenly moves in to steal her spotlight, she starts getting nervous and angry.  The only thing left is to try to out do him, but all his accomplishments seem to come with ease.
This sets the base for a story about growth, love, and understanding not often seen in anime.  The characters all seem very real, and their difficulties almost familiar.  Their struggles endear them to the viewer, and I found myself moved by these two characters' trial and tribulations.
This dvd is remarkable without the story.  There are literally thousands of words and emotions that flash on the screen.  These not only display the thoughts and hidden agendas of the characters, but also present themselves clearly despite their number.  These flashed words can also be changed separately from the subtitles, to ease in reading on the fly.
The artwork is wonderful, and the characters' emotions are amazingly well read.  One almost doesn't need to hear the words to feel the effects.  However, I will warn those that dislike distorted faces and teardrops and all those other 'stupid anime' things.  This anime has lots of this to help portray the strength of emotions.
So, if your looking for a romantic comedy, this is the anime your looking for.  A romantic story that grabs the heart and twists, coupled with a comedic undertone that helps you to see the true hilarity of trying to be perfect.  And if you find yourself staring out a window on a rainy day after watching this anime, don't blame me.",1055289600,,1871,4.678899082568807
1712056,5,B000066751,"Hello, and thank you for reading one more of my...reveiws.
I first watched His and Hers circumstances after my friend bought it.  She told me it was good, but it didn't sound like something I would like(I'm into sci-fi/action anime). But after the first two episodes, I found myself practicly passing out on the floor with laughter. My parents were looking at me funny, so I told them to sit down and watch for a while. Next thing I know, they're laughing right along with me!
The story is mainly about Yukino Miyazawa, a high school freshman. She has been ""putting on a total act"" of perfection for the public, but she's really kind of a bum. After she recieves SECOND best scores on the entrance exams, she is furious.  Thinking that the guy who beat her must be ""ugly, unlikable, and totally an outcast computer nerd"" she is even further angered to find the guy to be the handsome, smart, athletic, and polite Soichiro Arima. Think maybe he's putting on an act too.......?
I would definately recomend this to any anime fan-- new or hardcore. Just wait'll you meet the other characters in the series...",1053993600,,1104,4.627551020408164

The best thing about the anime is the way it expresses itself. It uses all these anti-traditional methods, like one episode had real taped backrounds- the characters were cut and pasted on to it! And every episode has different methods! Unlike most anime it doesn't give you all these blanks where nothing much happens- just to make the episode longer and in addition, the series as well; the story is fast moving and sometimes so fast you better pay attention or you'll miss a punchline! Sometimes it can get confusing because of the wierd ways it expresses the scenes, but you'll get used to it!",1051315200,,755,4.770992366412214
1712077,5,B000066751,"I first saw ""His and Her Circumstances"" a couple years ago as a fansub (Japanese title: Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyou).  The first DVD volume reminds me why I liked the series so much.
The story is about high school romance.  Sounds simple, right?  It never is.  The viewer gets a chance to listen to the main characters' thoughts and reasons for acting a certain way while enough is left out for good drama to be played out.
The DVD comes with a whopping 6 episodes (yay) and takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions: laughing hard one moment, crying my eyes out the next.
One thing I really like about this DVD is it's one of the first anime DVDs of late that I've seen pre-set to Japanese Audio with English Subtitles.  I prefer my anime that way.
This particular series has a lot of side text, too, but you need to setup English text for that to show up on your display (and I suggest you do because it's all the more funny to read the descriptions throughout the series, but you need to be a very fast reader or hit pause frequently).  Setting up the language options can be a little tricky...I was confused a couple times trying to figure out how to navigate to the right option. :)
All in all, a good buy for a good series.",1049760000,2,1225,4.2813852813852815
1712078,5,B000066751,"This is an excellent series with a very realistic love story. A boy named Soichiro and a girl named Yukino meet in high school. They both have hidden people inside each of them, different from the person they show on the outside. The two see each others' hidden characters and they fall in love.
The characters make this series. As with most anime, they are deeper than most American cartoons. You know them so well and you like them so much. The character design itself is excellent. They are all drawn well, and I like the comic-book style of the animation.
The only thing that may throw people off is that it's kind of slap-sticky. And when I say slap-sticky, I mean ANIME slap-sticky, which is sort of off the wall craziness. Hopefully that won't bother you, because I recommend that you watch this.",1049155200,,803,4.583333333333333

I had a lot of expectaion because of the japanese animation studio GAYNAX(-produced EVANGELEON series-loved them except last episode!) and the original comic books(very funny!). I read 14 comic books of this series before i watched this DVD and i think there would be a better way to make this animation close to original comic books.
yet, i enjoyed theme song in the beggining and also some of scenes and art directions are very unique to watch.",1046822400,,516,4.7444444444444445
1712081,5,B000066751,"I have watched many animes such as love hina, slayers, chobits,Chance pop session... and this one ""Kare Kano""(His and Her circumstances). Since it is posted by most people what the story is about, I'll focus my review on good points, bad points.
Great points: the art is beautiful, the way they draw is very unique, it is almost like reading a manga (japanese comic book), even though I felt like the style changed from episode to episode, but they kept the same beauty of slow motion movements in black and white, which was beautiful. I loved the story and the way it flows.
  They did a great job writing stories about the other characters but the main boy and Girl. You get to know them.
  The romance in the story is one of the main attractions for me. I loved the way it shows so much innocence, this is an anime I would not be afraid to share with a pre-teen (over 10 years old). There is no violence and the words and not tacky. It is extremelly tasteful. I recommend to anyone.... especially for girls out there that want their special someone to be more romantic.
Bad points: there are too many chapters that were reminding you of what had happened so far, and that kept repeating over and over, and I felt like they were dragging to get to the story.
  I know that it is a style of drawing and showing feelings on anime, but I don't really care when they draw the characters with a larger head and monstrous expressions everytime they are trying to pass a point (there is a lot of this in the story).
but overall, great show.
others I recomend: Chance pop session ( which just arrived in the Usa), Chobits ( cutiest thing!), Love Hina, Slayers, Princess Nine.
take care

1712082,4,B000066751,"His and Her Circumstances is about the unlikely romance between the two ""perfect"" kids in school.  They have both hidden themselves behind poker faces their entire lives. Through meeting and dating one another, they are able to peel away the layers of their deception.  And underneath it all...they're pretty whacky!!  They're both a little neurotic and unsure of where they stand in the relationship.  Now I know this makes it sound serious, but this anime is actually a romantic comedy and is full of laughs.  The reason I call it a cinematic experience is because of the unique way of portraying the scenes through the animation.  The art goes from silly to serious, from color to black and white or sketches.  I highly recommend it for everyone, but especially fans of animes like Love Hina or Marmalade Boy.  As a side note, this Dvd is automically set to play in Japanese.  If you want it in English (the dubs are good), you have to set it. I also recommend you set it up for subtitles of the Japanese writing on screen, since they use a lot of writing behind characters and such to express the character's emotions.

1712085,5,B000066751,"""His and Her Circumstances,"" or Kareshi Kanojo no Jijoo, is a show full of emotions, laughter, and tears.  It is also a show where the characters experience their growing pains:  in search of their inner selves and the meaning of love, which is very much reminiscent of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  It's a lot of fun to watch the show.  It is both hilarious and dramatic all at the same time.  Even though ""His and Her"" belongs to the relationship genre, it is not one of those daytime soap operas that would bore you (like Hana Yori Dango.)  The director skillfully blends in comedy, drama, and romance in a fast-paced half-hour show.  Every episode is so compact that it is as rewarding as watching a grade A 2-hour movie.
""His and Her"" is not a guy's romance story that plays to the guys' fantasy, which some other reviewers mentioned before.  For that, you have to check out Clamp's latest work, Chobits.  ""His and Her"" is one of the most realistic love stories I have ever seen.  It plays to the part of the girl's as well as the boy's psyche.  In the show, I saw a reflection of myself and my relationship, and my girlfriends and their relationships.  Many dialogue and self-examining questions posted in the episodes resemble the ones expressed by my girlfriends and their fiancs during their bridal showers:  what they were thinking or struggling to know what the other party was thinking, and what the funny moments, the memorable moments, and the hardships they went through during their courtships.  Thanks to Anno Hideaki's elaborate interviews and extensive research with today's Japanese high-school students.  The show is as real as watching a touched up documentary of everyday people.
I am impressed with the witty characters and the deep character development in the story.  Great editing but more work is needed on cinematography.  I greatly appreciate the deliberate use of music to accompany the flow of the story and to set the mood of the many segments of each episode.  On the other hand, I am VERY disappointed with the episodes toward the end, specifically Ep. 20 on.  The show went flat and it literally came to a halt at Ep. 24.  When it got to Ep. 26, 90% of the show was cut out shots from the manga.  One can infer that the Studio went out of money by the sudden, weary end at Ep. 26.  (This reminds me that Evangelion has an unsatisfactory ending too but Evangelion's abrupt ending wasn't about money.)  It is a pity to see such a wonderful anime, which started with such fanfare and great expectations, came to an end like this!  You can't even see what happened at the Culture Festival where Maho and Yukino were to be the leading actor and actress in a play.  (I am going to find the manga to find out the rest of the story!)  Other than that, this is a great anime where you would appreciate/love all the characters.  Thanks to the detailed character development work by the studio team.  Good work, team!  But please finish something next time!  ^_~  I also want to give my admiration to the translation team.  I don't know how you did it, especially the titles for some of the sub-segments that are old Chinese proverbs.  I would have to pull my hair off!  ^_^",1040601600,3,3195,4.6063829787234045
1712096,5,B000066751,"""His and Her Circumstances"" is a quality anime DVD worth buying.  At fist glance, it seems like a typical high school romance-comedy, but the story is good (so far), and the visual style is unique with the changes in the art, and text that appears onscreen.  The characters are truly funny and, sometimes very serious.  The series strongly relfects high school life, which, gives it the right amount of authenticity.  I would love to see the entire series.
There were six episodes on this DVD.  Most of the other anime DVD's in my collection contain only three or four.  This is a good bargain.
I am a big dub fan, and the voice actors are well suited to their characters.  The music is also very catchy.  While ""His and Her Circumstances"" is not an action series, that does not mean it's slow or boring.  Enjoy the series.",1040169600,,823,4.54421768707483
1712097,5,B000066751,"Well, what can I say... if you like anime like ""Love Hina"", ""Nadesico"" or ""Vandread"", you'll definitively be hooked on this one... same producers as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and ""Nadesico"", and the director of N.G.E. (who has lost some (ok, A LOT) of his suicidal tendencies and psychosis... and it shows in the show). You'll always be attentive to what's happenning, either because you're laughing hard, or because you're actually re-thingking what was said in the show... plus, if you had the chance to watch N.G.E., you'll find all those small references/puns/images/facial expressions/atmosphere...
Basically, His & her circumstances is a show about love (what is really love...), self-questionning a-la N.G.E... but you can easily watch it as ""light"" anime, and enjoy it just for laughs...
Having said that, all 5 DVDs are more than worth the price... my only regret is that the serie stops (and there won't be any more episodes/sequel) at 26 eps, which is kinda standrad in anime (which is a full anime season) but you'll see that the story comes to a halt after episode 24... Even though the manga it was based on is almost 50% longer... we don't even get to see the play they were planning... etc... the ""comming out"" of Arima's ""real"" self...
Still, lives up perfectly to the expectations of any anime lover, and it's a great show to iniate your girlfriend to anime... worked for me and she even hates Nadesico and Trigun, which are ""lighter"" animes than N.G.E., H&H Circumstances, Serial Experiment Lain, Cowboy Bebop...",1039910400,,1531,4.984375

1712103,5,B000066751,"Kareshi Kanojyo no Jijyou (the lengthy Japanese title) is one of the most truthful looks at high school and teenage life I have ever seen. The characters aren't perfect: they worry about grades, parents, relationships, and they're self-conscious. Studio Gainax (Evangelion, Nadia) adds a new drop to the shoujo formula, blending character developement and experimenting with different styles to present this genre. And surprise! It works wonderfully! Instead of providing just the female or male's perspective, they show both. Some episodes are devoted to one character, giving them a in-depth explanation as to why they act the way they do. An excellent example is Shibahime Tsubasa, a petite cutie pie of a girl with a bad attitude. The problems she has with her family present a clear look at her other side. As the episodes progress, you begin to notice how each person matures into something they wish to be, not putting up a facade and throwing away their mask. The message of this Japanese anime is clear: be yourself for your own true happiness. This is reinforced through beautifully-drawn manga stills, cut-up paper dolls, and super deformity. Gainax has succeeded yet again in creating a thoughtful anime enjoyable for everyone. Sadly, there will be no more episodes (26 was the last) due to conflicts with the manga author Tsuda Masami.

1712104,4,B000066751,"I've little to add to the raving reviews already posted about the story itself, so I shan't comment too much there.  I do have a few complaints about the disc, which I'll get to later.
Simply put, -His and Her Circumstances- is one of the most endearing teen serial romances ever made.  The dialogue is witty and often hilarious, and Hideaki Anno directs the work in a frenetic, zany style that perfectly matches the hormonal confusion of the two protagonists.  Few American teen serials match the wit of -His and Her Circumstances-, and no other show comes close to matching its charm.  This is by far my favorite anime, and when it finally became available in the United States, I quickly ordered my copy.
The DVD itself is not short on features.  Volume One, at least, includes animated storyboards, cast biographies, some commentaries, and even (?) the American producer's daily journal.  Personally, I am not one to get excited about such supplemental material, but at least they're trying.
The disc has the original Japanese audio track as well as an English track (which feels very awkward for such a distinctly Japanese story, but sounds acceptable).  English subtitles are also available, but the translation is sometimes clumsy and distracting (qv, Yukino's desire for ""pealings of admiration"").  Worse, the subtitling froze at one point.  This was easily fixed by resetting the titles, but such a glitch never should have passed through their QC team, no matter how small their company is.
The video quality is...  well, it looks like tv.  This doesn't bother me much, but those who demand pristine DVD quality will be a little disappointed.  It is certainly far superior to watching grainy bootleg videos, which is how I first saw -His and Her Circumstances-.
Ultimately, though, just be thankful that -His and Her Circumstances- is finally available in this country.  It is a wonderful story, and well worth seeking out, in spite of the disc's flaws.  Anime house Right Stuf deserves credit for their effort, but perhaps next time they can clean up the glitches and English translation.  5 Stars for the anime itself, 3 Stars for the disc, and 4 Stars for Right Stuf's ""college try.""",1028073600,5,2196,4.929347826086956

The disc itself is a technical masterpiece and has been said to be the most complex DVD ever produced.  The show has a large amount of on-screen text used to portray emotions and the innerworkings of the characters and The Right Stuf has done wonders with them, including using various colors, font sizes and fonts themselves that coincide with what they're displaying.
One can only hope that other companies will use this release as an example for the future and that TRSI itself can keep up the standard of excellence they have set forth with this first volume.

7962052,5,B000066751,"I have to say, when I see the covers of things like this I usually waver, that is to say, deny my own enjoyment. But wow.
It makes sense that the people who did Neon Genesis Evangelion did this, seeing as how they use the same link; stop lights, to symbolize the emotion of the show. The other reason I am not at all surprised is the quality of their product.
Tantamount to the group, the picture is excellent. Razor-sharp colors and text that should be becoming of all things people sell for this much money(Inuyasha on the other hand, well that's just cheep to sell three episodes for thirty dollars, and of bad picture quality).
Another sense of quality comes from the original over-seas show. I watched this in japanese with subtitles, it gives the show an orginal flavor, and even liked the sound of the music(not at all the lyrics). However they make this J-pop, it always sounds like JOURNEY, but with a year-2000 feel.
Then of course, there is the fantasy itself. Not so much fantasy as much as true epilogue of early High School. As far as ideas go, this one has been done over a thousand times, from Cyndyi Lauper's 'She's So Unusual' (which also kinda sounds like J-pop)to Breakfast Club, to Steven Van Sandt, and probably every movie starring someone like Hilary Duff. To actually make the idea sound crisp and new is very rare, especially seeing as how the last time anyone actually did that was with Breakfast Club and She's so Unusual(all 80's).
But anyways, they did it. What a magazine once preferred as one of the best anime's ever IS really excellent. Finding good anime is difficult, and this was like finding a golden egg in a basket of broken ones.
Most importantly though, they evolve the relationships well, taking time to notice the subtleties of a little girlfriend-boyfriend arrangement both expediently and thoroughly. And unlike some anime's(Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha) they get to the meat of the matter, and stop the apathy characteristic of most relationships in Japanese creation.
One may also notice how the idea of a high school student is almost obsessive in anime. Nearly all have some point about romantisizing high-school life. My theory is that the ones who create mangas, which are sometimes made into an anime, start right from High school, and usually don't have the time to mature in their new business world. The more complex one may come along once in a while, like Ghost In the Shell, but that isn't as often as the route found here.
Through all the same kind of stuff I've seen from over-seas, and out of it, I find myself enjoying this campy way of capturing ""boy & girl"". Even if this may not have much philosophical quality, or even much redeeming, I am still cringing, fainting, laughing, and modelizing this great triumph-in short, the first five episodes are perfect.",1133568000,3,2814,4.721544715447155

7962056,5,B000066751,"Although Gainax is best known for sci-fi epics such as EVANGELION, GUNBUSTER and WINGS OF HONNEAMISE, HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES - better known by its Japanese title, KARESHI KANOJYO NO JIJOU, or KARE KANO - marked an attempt by Gainax to try something new: a high-school romantic comedy.  It was also director Hideaki Anno's (EVANGELION, NADIA) directorial swan song in the anime industry before he went on to a career making live-action films.  The result is a high-school romantic comedy done ""Gainax-style"" - meaning it's anything but conventional, pablum or boring.
The characters are not ""stock"" characters by any means, but there are definite shades of EVANGELION in the main characters.  It's easy to see aspects of EVA's Asuka in Yukino, who, like Asuka, strives to be number one and is less than pleased when someone does better than she does.  And one could say that Arima is a lot like Shinji - not only does he look like an older and taller version of Shinji-kun, but he had an unhappy home life and parents who weren't around to support him when he needed it.  Both are driven to be model students for similar but different reasons.  Unlike Asuka and Shinji, however, Yukino and Arima realize their common ground, bond with each other, and begin to fall in love.  Theirs is not a fairy-tale romance, however (is anybody's ever, really?) - they have to weather all kinds of storms, both inside and outside of themselves.
I've only seen the first six episodes, but so far, this show is an absolute delight.  It moves quickly and features a lot of on-screen text, but not so quickly that you can't understand what's going on.  The supporting cast is a strong one too - Yukino's younger sisters, Kano and Tsukino, are adorable and playful but at the same time more wise in the ways of the world than their older sister.  There's also the requisite cute animal mascot (Pero-Pero, also spelled Pero^2 in much the same way that EVA's Pen-Pen was often spelled Pen^2), as well as Arima's self-proclaimed best friend, Hideaki Asaba, who has dreams of becoming the next Hugh Hefner and building a harem of beautiful girls called ""Merryland"" to keep him company.  The music - by Shiro Sagisu, who's done a lot of music for Gainax productions including EVA and NADIA - is very well done too.  On top of that, it gives a lot of insight as to the pressures that high school students in Japan feel to succeed, and since I went to a private religious high school with very high academic standards myself, I find Yukino and Arima's plight easily relatable.
As if that weren't enough, I think the dubbed version is very well-done.  Veronica Taylor's Yukino is terrific and will make you forget that Ms. Taylor was ever Ash Ketchum in ""Pokemon."" Yukino changes moods so quickly and expresses such a wide variety of emotions, and Veronica nails them all.  Most of the other dub voice actors do a good job as well.  The two ladies who play Tsukino and Kano actually come out from behind the microphone to host the ""next episode"" previews - in character.  It's obvious that the voice actors all had a blast doing this show, which seems like it would be a harder show to dub than most.  One of the better-done dubs I've seen.
All in all, it's definitely a shojo show, but if you're an open-minded guy you'll find a lot to like here too.  KARE KANO shows off Gainax's versatility and how they can take just about any genre of anime and, through turning it upside down, make it their own.",1085616000,5,3476,4.642740619902121
