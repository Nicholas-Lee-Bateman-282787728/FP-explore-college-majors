2465770,5,B000CMPSSK,"here is one of those films that should be seen every christmas season when a person has had enough of 'it's a wonderful life'. not that capra or james stweart is a bad combination but we must remember that harm springs from excess.

content wise, it's quite dark.  a leech-like family finds that a very rich member has passed away and left his riches to a young woman that played little eva in a road show production of 'uncle tom's cabin' as a child.  and it is up to a mysterious gentleman to make sure she gets her inheritance.

does she get it? well, it is christmas season, so...we'll just have to hope that this dark little gem of a film is on the restoration dock and will get a nice little re-release one christmas very soon so we can find out! and we can enjoy the performances of almost forgotten actors like the authoritative joseph schildkraut, the classy, but ultimately tragic ona munson and the iconic billie burke as the type of dithery matriarch she did so well!",1260576000,5,979,4.4525139664804465
2465771,5,B000CMPSSK,I saw this film on TCM in December of 2008.  I cannot believe that I had never seen this before.  I was fortunate enough to acquire it by way of a third party through Amazon.  I just watched the DVD and I must admit it is one of the finest holiday films I've ever seen.  The true meaning of Christmas touches everyone involved upon the conclusion of this film.  This film will definitely become a holiday tradition in my home!,1234569600,4,426,4.275
2465772,3,B000CMPSSK,"A great old movie once impossible to get.  This copy, however, was severely compromised with many drop-outs and skips.  The original may have been this way; however, it seems to me that such problems should be able to be mitigated with electronic editing.",1232841600,12,255,4.906976744186046
2465773,5,B000CMPSSK,"Before A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas and a Christmas Story, came to the forefront of the cannon of hoilday movies. There was ""The Cheaters"".
 It was,(when I was young)shown either on Christmas eve, or New Years eve.
It is sort of a modern take on a Christmas Carol. It was about greed and
self realization. As well redemption.
 But it gradually faded from tv listings over the years.
It hasn't been seen on the screen in more than 30 years! But perhaps that
will change. Now that TCM has shown it this past Christmas Eve 2008.
 Hopefully TCM will added to the cannon of enjoyable hoilday movies once again!
 Also there is a dvd of the Cheaters. Unforturnetly it is not
gernerally available. I found one here on Amazon. But it was through a third party seller. And only one copy was available, that I missed getting!
 Hey Amazon! Please try to aquire copies of this wonderful dvd for next year!",1230163200,14,921,4.557575757575758
2465774,5,B000CMPSSK,"This was one of those movies that played around Christmas time faithfully about 30 years ago, along with ""Christmas in Connecticut"", ""The Bishop's Wife"" and the 1930's American version of ""A Christmas Carol"".  Unfortunately, it got lost and I am thrilled to see it on VHS, if not DVD!  It's the story of a spoiled rich family headed by the sweet, if ineffectual, Billie Burke as the mother and the blustering, if ineffectual, Eugene Pallette as the father.  Their eldest daughter brings home a homeless man, the wonderful Joseph Schildkraut, for all the wrong reasons. Their frenetic, shallow lives play out in front of him as he eventually teaches them the true meaning of the holidays and family while learning a little from them, too.  I love that the daughter brings him home strictly to aggravate and challenge her parents and impress her boyfriend, a soldier. Her parents respond with disdain and nervous tolerance, attitudes that certainly haven't changed since this movie was made. What has changed and what is lost is the plush sets of the 1930's and early 1940's and the old comedic style of films like these. And the fact that it is a family movie (yes, one that will entertain you and that your kids may enjoy in spite of themselves) makes it worth the money to add this to your holiday viewing.",1154217600,20,1307,4.744493392070485
2465775,4,B000CMPSSK,"Great old fashioned comedy, well done black and white movie from the 40s that I gather is out of print. I was a little disappointed to see that the media was a ""burned"" DVD rather than a commercially printed one. The printing of the label on the box and on the front of the disc looks professional enough, but it clearly was made on someone's computer. I had no technical issues playing it on my DVD player and the sound and the picture were satisfactory",1418428800,,454,4.352941176470588
2465776,5,B000CMPSSK,"Excellent quality. We watched and waited years to get this.  (It was a bit expensive, but we watch it every Christmas eve!)",1392249600,,123,4.590909090909091
2465777,5,B000CMPSSK,"Tired of syrupy, sugar-coated Christmas movies?  Ready for some honest sentiment served up with a touch of vinegar in it?  Then seek out ""The Cheaters""!  This low-budget, neglected little gem is exactly what you're looking for!  Enacted by a wonderful cast of brilliant character actors, including Joseph Schildkraut (who won the Oscar for his supporting turn in ""The Life of Emile Zola""), portly, gravel-voiced Eugene Pallette, fluttery Billie Burke (Glinda the Good Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz""), and Ona Munson (Belle Watling in ""Gone With the Wind""), the movie focuses on a group of basically decent people who aren't behaving very decently at the moment.  High-living industrialist Pallette and his wife Burke have invited penniless actor Schildkraut, a ""charity case"", to spend the holidays with their family, for appearances' sake.  Unfortunately, they're running a little low on cash at the moment, and are waiting for a rich relative to kick the bucket and put them back in the black.  When the relative dies and unexpectedly leaves his money to an impoverished woman they've never met (Munson), the family enlists the alcoholic actor's help in tricking her out of her inheritance.  What's really funny is that Munson thinks she's the one taking advantage of Pallette and his family by allowing them to take her in for the holidays!  Everyone, it would seem, is a ""cheater"" in his or her own way.

Frances Hyland adapted the script from an original story she co-wrote with Albert Ray, and she did a marvelous job of deftly blending comedy and drama with satire and romance.  Each of the actors is given a special opportunity to shine, and director Joseph Kane keeps everything clipping along at perfectly timed pace.  The production values are extraordinarily good for a Republic Pictures Production: the art direction, set decorations, visual effects and cinematography are all first-rate.  It's hard to figure out why this lovely little movie never built the audience it deserved, but it can't have helped that it was originally released in the summertime (July 1945), just as World War II was ending.  Curiously renamed ""The Castaway"", it was re-released to theatres a few years later, but didn't fare any better at the box office.  A shame ... it truly deserved to succeed.

The film has popped up briefly on video, and is occasionally shown on TCM (I originally saw it on TNT in the wee hours of the morning back in 1980).  Here's hoping that one of the many companies that currently restores and releases older films like this one will take a chance and give it the release it deserves.  (Olive Films, Kino, etc ... is anyone listening?)  But until that happens, keep an eye out for ""The Cheaters"".  You'll be so glad you did.",1386547200,3,2740,4.928104575163399
2465778,5,B000CMPSSK,"I have no idea why this movie has been forgotten! It is such a gem. Amazon, please, please get this movie back in stock and in DVD format. I can think of 4 families, not including my own, that I would buy this for.
A story about a rich, spoiled family (think My Man Godfrey), who is taught a lesson by the ""forgotten man"" they take in for the holidays and their poor relation that they are trying to swindle. The performances are just classic character actor portrayals from back then, everyone flitting about and talking over one another...really just a delight if this is your thing.",1384473600,,585,4.4766355140186915

2465780,5,B000CMPSSK,This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  Loved the movie!!!!!  Glad I got the last copy from Amazon on DVD and didn't wait.  Quite a shame if they cannot get more copies of this movie.,1337644800,,208,3.7906976744186047
2465781,5,B000CMPSSK,"If you're looking for an slightly offbeat Christmas movie with the right message, look no further than this underrated gem from the mid-1940s.  It includes such terrific character actors as Eugene Pallette, Joseph Schildkraut and Billie Burke.  (Yes, I know Billie Burke is a woman.)  The plot spins around cheating a good-hearted working-class woman out of her inheritance, and everyone learns about the true meaning of Christmas before it is over.",1326672000,3,449,5.295774647887324
2465782,5,B000CMPSSK,"I found this movie one sunday on TV, I searched and searched for it.  I am so surprised it has not been redone and released. This has a beautiful message and all the trimmings. It is well worth the purchase.  I see this type of greed everyday and its funny to have what is not discussed brought out in the open...sent copies to my greedy sisters...LOVE it

Oh the movie is a bit cheesey in copy but great message",1325203200,2,412,4.189873417721519

8099285,5,B000CMPSSK,"I remember this film being a holiday staple, it was shown on WGN TV in Chicago every Christmas Eve for years, then it disappeared, I think it was because the television rights had changed hands. It has rarely been televised since, too bad. It is delightful holiday viewing. I was fortunate enough to purchase the DVD from Amazon, it was rarely offered and I grabbed a copy when one came up for sale, which has excellent quality. I now watch it on Christmas Eve myself, it has become a classic. It's too bad it has fallen into obscurity, it should have as much exposure as other classic holiday films such as A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life.",1512172800,3,652,4.487394957983193

8099290,5,B000CMPSSK,"An absolutely amazing 1940's film.  If you are a fan of Capra's Wonderful Life, and other Christmas themed movies from the same era, you should love The Cheaters.  It has a nice little story involving a materialistic New York family that that tries to prevent an unemployed actress from inheriting a fortune.  They whisk her off to an abandoned country house, where they hope to keep her away from the news, but when they are all forced to build the fireplace, decorate the tree and cook the dinner themselves, the Christmas spirit comes through.  Though it has a B movie feel to it, it is marvelously scripted and directed.  But the old school actors really sell the film, and they include Billie Burke, Eugene Pallette, Raymond Walburn and Joseph Schildkraut as the washed up Shakespearean who saves the day.  I would take this movie over Bing Crosby's Holiday Inn, or his White Christmas.  It definitely needs to be re-discovered just like Wonderful Life was a few years ago.  Hopefully Amazon will offer it for streaming next year.",1420675200,,1035,4.807909604519774
