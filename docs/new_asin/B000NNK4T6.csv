2772276,5,B000NNK4T6,"Our 16 month old loves this video!  We don't let her watch TV, but purchased this video for a long road trip when she was 13 months old to stave off screaming fits. It was love at first viewing.  She loves to make animal noises along with the kids & started trying to say her ABC's a month ago, she also likes saying goodbye to all of the babies at the end of the video. I like that it's low tech and only uses real children & puppets instead of cartoons.  We purchased the other Know - It - All video because she liked this one so much & she enjoys it as well & has picked up a lot of lessons from watching the kids in the video.",1428883200,,630,3.868217054263566
2772277,5,B000NNK4T6,My toddler loves this and the other baby know it all video.  It's one of the few videos he is able to sit and watch and tries very hard to interact with.  It's cute and done well and works with his unique learning abilities.,1419724800,,224,4.068181818181818
2772278,3,B000NNK4T6,thought it would help baby but to slow and hasen't learned anything yet I'll try  again when she's  2 years old,1368662400,,111,4.238095238095238
2772279,1,B000NNK4T6,"My son has an obsession with the alphabet since he was 9 months old. He starting writing his alphabet at one years old. He has tons of letter toys and that is what he loves over any other toy. He lines his letters up in certian patterns etc. Everything has to be uniformed. In this video it is not consistant. It jumps from letters. Like starts with letter B and shows one b animal and then goes to D and shows three d animals. This freaked my son out. He wanted to know why it did not start with A and why they skipped over C. He started to get stressed out. So I had to turn it off. We have seen a lot of alphabet videos and this one was the worse buy. The best one we came across is Leap Frog [hpnics farm and Elmo's Alphabet Jungle. Sesame street All Star Alphabet is good too,",1352851200,,781,3.9808917197452227
2772280,5,B000NNK4T6,"These are the best videos for teaching your child to talk. My son receives speech therapy and his therapist was even impressed with both volumes. My son learned his ABC's at 18 months by watching the Animals and ABC Vol 2. Fantastic...better than the videos that cost a fortune for the collection you see on tv,as we bought one after this one. They do not hold his attention as well as Baby Know It All.",1301875200,,403,4.386666666666667
2772281,4,B000NNK4T6,"I was not impressed with the quality of the film (pretty low-budget), but my 1.5 year old doesn't mind. It is a long movie (80 min) for a decent price and it has a repeat play feature to play the whole thing over and over without having to restart it (came in handy when I was on bedrest and couldn't change movies very often). The credits are really long though, and my kids get frustrated between Vol 1 and Vol 2 having to sit through all of the credits and worried the next part wasn't going to start.",1294272000,,504,4.153061224489796
2772282,2,B000NNK4T6,"I own both ""My baby know it all: Animals and ABC's"" and ""My baby know it all:123's and colors"" and my daughters LOVE them. They really are great videos that keep a young child's attention while teaching them. In fact, I bought this DVD because our other two DVD's were getting worn out and would skip a lot. I thought that this DVD had both movies on it, because that is what the cover says. The DVD I got was NOT both vidoes. All the DVD I got had on it was the ""123's and Colors"". NO where on that DVD could I find the ""Animals and ABC's"" no matter how much I searched through the DVD. I do recommend buying this video series, just make sure you buy them as two seperate DVD's so you KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING.",1288915200,,712,4.056737588652482
2772283,5,B000NNK4T6,My two year old daughter really improved her numbers and ABC's with this dvd. I highly reccommend it.,1227916800,,101,4.666666666666667
2772284,5,B000NNK4T6,"My neighbor gave us one of the ABC dvds and it was really cute.  They continue the series with the counting one, all in all it is cute, educational and engaging for children.  Gives parents a bit of time to do whatever while the children watch it. :)",1219708800,2,250,4.1875

8179346,5,B000NNK4T6,"My 15 month-old grandson loves his Baby Know-It-All videos! He recognizes the children who star in them, and laughs when they'd do funny things. The videos engage his interest while he learns colors, animals, and, so far, the numbers 2,3, and 8. ",1474156800,,246,4.857142857142857

8179350,5,B000NNK4T6,"My son LOVES this series, obsessively, (along with Baby Babble) since he was about a year old. He knew all his basic colors at 18 months old, started counting to 10 at 20 months, and at 21 months is starting to recognize letters. Not that it's all attributed to a TV show ;) but I really think that it's helped!!",1455580800,,312,4.216666666666667
