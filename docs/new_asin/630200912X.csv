408058,5,630200912X,"No, Phoebe Cates, cute as she is, is not the angel. This time Emmanuelle Beart is the angel.

The story is one of those strait forward situation comedies. As in ""Heaven Can Wait"" or more like ""Meet Joe black"", an angle on a mission is detoured when a satellite nicks her wing. She lands in a pool of a soon to be married musician (Jim). You know musicians; he is obligated to help the angle, yet he can not tell his fiance (Patty), who of course suspects there is another woman. Naturally his friends find out and plan to get rich. And so on and so on.

Eventually the angle that by this time is enamored with Jim and vice versa is well and leaves. Patty who has been insulted and assaulted by Jim and the angle leaves also. To top it off maybe there was no angle. Seems Jim has a brain tumor. So how did everyone get in this situation and what is to become of Jim?",1504051200,,865,4.112426035502959

408062,5,630200912X,"This film Date With An Angel is a cute and heartwarming film. The movie plot of Date With An Angel deals with a man named Jim Sanders (Michael Knight) who has a successful career and is engaged to his bosss daughter Patty Winston (Phoebe Cates). To put it lightly, Sanders life is not the same after a mysterious looking woman (Emmanuelle Beart) comes into his life and turns out to be angel. There is more to this endearing film including other actors and actresses involved in the Date With An Angel film, yet I want to be considerate of the people who have yet to watch Date With An Angel.",1501372800,,592,4.390909090909091

408302,4,630200912X,"It is no surprise that Date With An Angel is often purchased alongside Splash!, for it is a similar fish-out-of-water story to the extent that the titular angel is first seen passed out in the protagonist's pool. While the film is by no means on par with the classic Tom Hanks mermaid movie, neither did it deserve the crushingly-poor box office reception and savage critical panning which brutalized it upon its release.

The overarching plot elements are all present: the ethereal innocent sent to save a sensitive man who has difficulty with earthly relationships, the annoying-yet-redeemable pseudo-antagonist(s) who seeks to use this ethereal creature for profit and recognition, and the rescue of this being leading to the satisfying-if-unrealistic conclusion. Where Date With An Angel fails, however, is in its apparent attempts to stray from the formula displayed so well in Splash! Michael Knight's character is nearly as flawless as his actor's name implies, the supporting (and I use the term loosely) cast is virtually entirely negative, and yet the antagonists are not so much threatening as comically sociopathic. Character growth is in essence absent save in Phoebe Cates' character, whose severe emotional problems remind us of her role in Gremlins and its sequel, yet her development only takes her deeper into a psychosis which is painful to watch especially as it is treated so lightly.

However the true sunshine in this movie is present in Emmanuelle Beart's portrayal of the angel. Though the magnificently-beautiful actress and her lovely French accent are muted throughout most of the film (either to prevent her character from revealing Heavenly mysteries or as another nod to Splash!), she nevertheless manages to convey an innocent and affectionate manner which seems genuinely ethereal. The animatronics/special effects department does not fail her either; she is equipped with feathered wings which are every bit as convincing as the mermaid tail in Splash! and accompanied by all the well-placed soft lighting which one would expect from a show about an angel. This, coupled with Beart's performance and the wretchedness of most of the human characters causes the gentle angel to literally shine far brighter than anything in the mortal realm.

Date With An Angel is worthy lighthearted viewing despite its faults. Its comedy varies from the slapstick to the comedy of contrasting ideals (much of which is offered by the angel herself) yet rarely descends into the crude. If one thinks angelically, one will easily be able to see the good in this film.",1437868800,,2582,5.231884057971015

408552,5,630200912X,"I never heard of this film until last month and it was made in 1987!  I was searching TV channels for something to watch and stumbled on this film on one of the Encore channels.  The film was in progress and Lucky me when I turned it on I caught the angel's face.  I was instantly hooked, and watched the whole movie.  It is obviously a low budget work, but the script, acting, production design, and direction are first rate.  Some of the scenes were tongue-in-cheek and very funny.  And who can ignore Emmanuel Beart!  She was 24 when she made this film and in Europe she was voted the sixth most beautiful woman in the world.  Not hard to see why!  Whoever did the casting for this production rates an Oscar.  Very entertaining film, highly recommended.  Delightful ending.",1403913600,,776,4.510791366906475

Phoebe Cates got a bad rap in this film.  She is sweet, beautiful and intelligent, and engaged to the lead boy.  She loves this stupid kid, but he falls in love with an angel.  Now the script takes a wrong turn and tries to make Phoebe a bad person because the kid broke her heart and she's pissed off at him.  Duh.

The film should have ended 5 minutes earlier than it did.  But they decided to give it a ""Hollywood"" ending. Too bad.

The outcome of the movie is fortunately not predictable. It's not clear until very late in the movie which girl Jim will end up with.

Even in those twenty painful minutes, anyone could see the plot is absurd, the acting is laughable, the direction is amateurish. This movie is well below a B movie, it takes itself more seriously.

Something seems gravely amiss with the reviews. Some of the reviewers reviewed no other movies, for example. None of them actually seem to have purchased the movie here on Amazon.

Is there some game-playing going on? Could 30 reviewers really believe this piece of junk is worth 5-stars? I'm irate, as they cost me $3.00 and 20 minutes.

Amazon should take steps to make sure the ratings are more accurate. For example, people should be able to watch the first five or ten minutes of a movie, especially obscure movies, before paying their money. Or people should be able to get a refund if the movie is bad. And if in fact the other reviews are not genuine, Amazon should do something about fake reviews.

I didn't like the movie because the acting was poor.  It was a B rated film.  The angel didn't speak; but rather made weird noises/tones, then people would look at her and all of a sudden become quiet and peaceful because her gentleness somehow was cast into them.  The friends of the guy that who found her were trying to kidnap her so that they could make money from showing her.  I think I expected a love story, but this was nothing like I expected.

It's a simple, heartwarming, romantic fantasy that has a dream like quality to it, especially toward the end of the movie. The lead actor is dashing and the Angel, well, the best way to describe her is that she is out of this world. Never in my life have I seen an angel so enchantingly beautiful.
The story is light, humorous and during the last ten minutes of the film, I found myself crying one minute and smiling the next. It may not be the best film in the 80's, but it surely has the staying power, in my mind anyway. Movies nowadays have too much sex or violence in them. This is a cozy little film that I have enjoyed watching time and time again. I hope more people who are romantic at heart fall in love with this movie.",1196208000,,879,4.057471264367816

But beyond the lovely Ms. Beart, Date with an Angel is totally worth seeing if you are into very cute romantic comedies.

Jim is getting ready to marry his fiance Patty, a spoiled daddy's girl, when his plans are thrown into a loop. It all begins with his friends kidnapping him for his surprise bachelor party, the moring after which he finds a beautiful angel unconcious in his pool. Jim's attempts to help the angel get home complicates his life in more ways then he has ever imagined and both hilarity and romance ensue.

Date with an Angel is totally worth watching. Both adorable and funny, it will entertain pretty much anyone who sits down to watch it.

It especially makes me mad when a super-cheeseball film like MANNAQUIN can find enough popularity to have a sequel made (of sorts) but not this one, which has similar plot themes (ordinary guy gets magical girlfriend) but is way, way better...like comparing a film like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING to forgettable trash like MEATBALLS 3.

You fall in love with the characters and the story, and the film has several hilarious moments, like when the angel charms the attack dog from next door, and then Patty's dad comes to berate Jim and then sees the angel and is charmed by her mere presence, then the moment the angel and Jim go inside the attack dog turns vicious again and attacks the dad! (Remember this is a comedy, so the guy doesn't really get hurt or anything, he just runs away terrified with the dog chewing on his pant leg.) O.K., the film's one real weakness is the singing ""Love Bug"" guy, who is more annoying than anything eles. Otherwise, this film is pure enjoyment beginning to end. The music score is excellent as well. I just wish I knew how to reach the people who made this movie so I could tell them myself how much I love it.

That I thought it was refreshing changes form devil related movies. It gives viewers an awsome visual of how angels can be.

It starts off where his buddies kidnap him from the snobish get together at Patty's house for jim's bachelor party.

 Left in a stupor from partying hard, An angel( Beart) crashes into Jim's pool after her wing is hit by a satelite. Jim awakens not from the crash mind you but let's face it pool water flowing on you butt will wake any drunken bachelor boy up.

The comedy insues when Jim has to and try's to hide the angel from his get rich schemeing buddies and bratish rich girl wife to be Patty ( Cates) not to mention Her dad, and a really mean dog outside his house.

It's a good film. And it serves it's purpose. You root for Jim and The Angel. and Emanualle Beart is great as an angel. Thru out the movie she doesnt talk but really uses her expressions very well. She acts with her eyes and face rather well.

Let's face it its a nice romantic comedy with a supernatural overtone. You cant help but like Jim and the Angel and dislike Phoebe's character and her dad. Sure Cates is hot, But maybe thats the message. Her red car, her getting Jim in a marriage and having him give up music. To every angel there's a devil. Jim is loyal just trying to help the angel find her way back home and wait for her wing to heal so she can fly home. But nobody seems to believe him. His buddies have exploitations all set up for the angel. And they even manage to kidnap her so they can have a press conference with a tape recorder for music at the town hall. But with all the commotion going on and when the final plot twist finally comes you understand more.

Jim is too good for Patty. It takes an angel to show him that shes a wench. The church doesnt beleive in his angel and Jim is told to take his antics elsewhere. His buddies are money hungry, and his father-in-law to be is willing to push Patty aside because he thinks the Angel is the perfect new cover girl. Hell if I were Jim I'd have an anyuerism too.

It's really a great movie for the family. I can't believe critics rated as a underrated movie, but somehow it slides by me as a heartwarming, heavenly-made movie about a beautiful angel sent to earth to bring a guy back to heaven. The beautiful angel is played by Emmanuelle Beart which she definately looks beautiful and stunningly. From what I heard, they had chose over 500 women actress for this role. They did a excellent job with the angel. She looks like she's real. Sent from above to Earth to bring back Jim (Micheal E. Knight), a composer whose life isn't going to well because of continous terrible headaches, also engaged to a spoiled rich girl Patty(Phoebe Cates).
Too make the story short, Jim become lucky and finds the injured angel in his pool after waking up from a bachelor party and tries to hide it from his friends, fiancee, and soon to be father-in-law. When things got out hand, his friends wants the angel as a business plan, his fiancee becomes outrageous jealous and misunderstands as a affair, and his future father-in-law wants her as a world marketing plan. In the end, Jim did past away and was brought back to life by the angel and...the angel became a human.
Date with an Angel is a great movie and I still do watch it. I heavenly recommend this movie. It has none of that oscar winning nomination or 3 hour long of boring concept with no point. It's just a movie that makes you feel how good life is. Get in DVD for widescreen and better quality.",1025740800,5,1655,4.465346534653466

Admittedly, this film lacks some coherent plot and at least some memorable dialogues  but I can't help but enjoy this 'little' film about mortal falling in love with an immortal.
It's been done before with a story like this but this film somehow manages to give some new angle like the unexpected ending.
  Unabashedly, I watch the film because of the two actors: Emmanuelle Beart and Phoebe Cates. Emmanuelle is wonderful and at times convincing as an angel just as Phoebe Cates is believable as bratty rich girl. But somehow I felt that Phoebe is terribly wasted. Maybe, the ending adds more to the feeling but all in all, she proves nothing here but to add credentials to her list of filmography. Talk about her other film, Drop Dead Fred.
  As I have said before, movies that deals with 'magical' beings really pleases me so I may rightfully add that I also like Splash but that's another story, er, review. Although disappointed by the dvd format having only a theatrical trailer as a bonus, I need not fret since I know that this is only a 'small' and overlooked film. Other movies in dvds suffer the same fate but somehow those films are above average in budget so that may come as a real shock.
  Before I forgot, this film has some nice soundtrack like the forgotten(?!) Pop Goes the World and I remember it very clearly the Air Supply song, Someone Who Believes In You. The song is well-known but it doesn't figure in the film.
  As a last word, watch it strictly for entertainment only because that's only the film gives.",1022457600,,1660,4.581081081081081

7819501,5,630200912X,"When I was a movie theater manager back in the 80's, I had the pleasure of screening this movie and thought it was wonderful. Girls came out of the theater crying on their boyfriends shoulders and everyone had smiles on their faces. However, the critics panned it terribly and not many came to see this great show which I thought was a real crime. Because of these charlatan judges, this movie failed at the box office. I have never forgiven those who were responsible for this.

I just want to say, that I still think this is a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, dated (pardon the pun) thought it may be. It is both funny, heartwarming and sometimes sad, but with the proverbial happy ending. You will do yourself a favor if you take the time to watch it.",1516147200,,770,4.384615384615385
