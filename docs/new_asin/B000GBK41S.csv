8130504,5,B000GBK41S,"Features Judy Davis in an early role.
  Ever hear of John Hargreaves? Me neither. I went looking for an early Judy Davis film (she was only 26 years ols when she did this film) and found a movie Id never heard of. Hoodwink was filmed the same year as another Judy Davis rarity, Winter of our Dreams. As for Mr. Hargreaves, he was great in this one portraying the ultimate con-man. He robs banks and he acts so cool and distanced when hes doing the crime that nobody seems to remember him. Unfortunately for him, hes a womanizer and his latest pick-up drops a dime on him and he goes to jail for a twenty-year stretch (they are tough in Australia). Once hes in the pen he devises the ultimate con  he suddenly goes blind. Being blind he is transferred to a minimum security prison where he enjoys a weekly one-day leave when he is left to the custody of a couple of do-gooders who have strong religious ties to the community. The husband and wife team want to convert the thief to their religion, but the felon is more interested in seducing the wife (Judy Davis), all the time planning his escape.",1386547200,3,1097,4.394088669950739
