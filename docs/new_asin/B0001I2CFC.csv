2002754,5,B0001I2CFC,"Do you like adventure, mystery, comedy, romance, science fiction?  If you answered yes to any of these, then you'll love this dvd set.  Arthur Conan Doyle's The lost World has it all!
The Outlaw , Survivors, and Pirate's Curse are worth the price of the set alone.",1087862400,2,264,4.595744680851064

Between the dinosaurs, the apemen (trogs), voodoo priestesses, man-eating flora, aliens, the list goes on and on, every episode goes non-stop from start to finish.  And with a very talented and likeable group of actors, you can't help but fall in love with this unlikely bunch - the scientist, the heiress, the reporter, the hunter and the jungle princess.  Well worth the price to add this to your TV DVD collection.",1087862400,2,521,4.7032967032967035

It's a show the entire family can enjoy and the DVD's are fabulously done. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves adventure, romance, or both.",1087862400,2,307,4.811320754716981
2002758,5,B0001I2CFC,"SACD's saga of a band of explorers lost on a fantastic plateau in the South American jungle has been introduced during its first season. Season 2 starts to develop the characters and their amazing chemistry and relationships beautifully. Every single episode shows intelligent plotting, fascinating story lines and a tremendous amount of talent on the actors' side. Not to mention the great scripts. And if Season 2 is a treat to watch, just wait for Season 3. You WILL be thrilled.",1087862400,,482,4.962962962962963
2002759,5,B0001I2CFC,"Pure entertainment with episodes that have action, humor, and without a doubt - great looking actors. Pretty funny dialogue with some interesting ideas used in the shows such as time travel, science ethics and of course semi-clad Voodoo priestess dancing the night away.",1087776000,2,270,5.3023255813953485

2002761,5,B0001I2CFC,"I've always enjoyed SACD THE LOST WORLD and while this season (#2) started out slow it certainly ended on a high note! Some GREAT episodes!
Favorites include: ""Stone Cold"" (a Halloween eppie), ""The Outlaw"" (the beginning of change for M&R), ""The Survivors"" ( hurt/comfort at its best), ""Pirates Curse"" (very funny!) - etc.
Now, when will Season three be on DVD?????",1087776000,3,365,5.0
2002762,4,B0001I2CFC,"Any fan of the first season will want the further saga of our intrepid group of travellers in the Lost World.

Once again they are stranded in this strange and wonderful land, and they encounter all kinds of new lands with different races that are friendly or hostile. Good add on to the first season. I recommend it, it's another batch of fun episodes. Besides Amazon's price for this set is great. I shopped around and I haven't seen it cheaper.",1078099200,15,770,4.840909090909091

2002771,5,B0001I2CFC,"I loved this series pretty much all the way through, I'm sorry it ended the way it did but they gave us 3 solid seasons of silly awesome adventure so i'll forgive it, if I had to say one bad thing, it would be they stopped showing as much buttock shots of Veronica as the series went on, but perhaps they felt they didn't need to because people were being entertained my the story line, who knew right?!? But I love this series, it's priced outragouslly but meh it's just money.",1397520000,,478,4.263736263736264
2002772,5,B0001I2CFC,This is so beautifully done however the expense of the production lead to it not being continued so you are left unhappy that it wasn't continued. Great plot and I love the characters and the actors.,1395187200,,199,4.555555555555555

2002774,2,B0001I2CFC,"This review is for the DVD set not the show. I love the TV show !!!

GOOD POINTS
The quality of the DVD is good thus the 2 stars.

BAD POINTS
1) This is the made for VT version NOT the Pay-per-view version. It has nude and extra shot removed.
2) The price they want for this is a joke. If people are buying this at this price they could very easy make more and bring down the price.
3) There are NO extra things on this DVD at all. Nothing, Just the TV show. Not even CC.

Personal Note:
When they start asking for so much for a TV show they are only begging for people to make copies of it and sale it. I feel if they don't want to make the show available for sale they should loose their copyrights to it. After all the whole point of copy right laws are so people do not make money off of it, so the person that made it can make money off of it. Thus if your not going to even try to make money off of it then open it up to the free market.

They should have at least gave us the full version and not the cut for TV cut. That is just wrong.

Out of all the people that went into the making of this they could not even find one person to sit for an hour to do at least one commentary? WTF?",1385078400,6,1191,3.748
2002783,5,B0001I2CFC,good series I enjoyed it and I look foward to viewing the rest of the dvd it was a real treasure,1381968000,,96,3.619047619047619
2002784,5,B0001I2CFC,this was a great movie and I think it would make a great gift to give to some one and I would recommend it to some one,1375315200,,118,3.4074074074074074
2002785,5,B0001I2CFC,Great show. Like a more serious Gilligan'sIsland. I really love the treehouse! The cgi is really good. Costumes are great too.,1370908800,,126,5.0476190476190474
2002786,5,B0001I2CFC,"Season two of The lost world is a step up in story telling, memorable acting performances and character development. If you loved the first season of the lost world, you'll surely love the second season even more! It's probably the best season out of the three. The most solid and entertaining one. I like how each season contains 22 episodes. That's over 16 hours of great entertainment! So for paying $25 or around that much for a lost world season, I think it's worth it. Even if there are no extras to speak of.

The lost world kind of reminds me of Stargate SG1 because of the good interesting story writing, nice colorful characters and layers upon layers of mystery involved which professor Challenger can only try as he must to explain it all to our viewing audience and to the other confused characters around him. Just as Samantha Carter had to do being the scientist on Stargate SG1.",1368144000,,894,4.622641509433962
2002787,5,B0001I2CFC,Okay so the graphics in this series are corny at best but that is my thing!!! Doesn't follow the book but still entertaining none the less... A must have for anyone who finds this kind of thing fun and Lord John Roxton is very easy on the eyes as well!,1366070400,,252,4.06
2002788,5,B0001I2CFC,Season 2 is pretty comparable to Season 1 with the exception of the absence of Dr. Summerlee. Great interesting stories that touch on a vast array of topics. I really enjoy getting lost in these episodes.,1352764800,,204,4.694444444444445
2002789,4,B0001I2CFC,product came nicely packed and came much sooner then i expected am very pleased with the item and service one of my favorite shows i am very glad to find these for sale at such a great price,1350345600,,190,4.026315789473684
2002790,2,B0001I2CFC,"Season Two is very much like Season One--so, if you liked Season One...If you park realism and common sense outside, this is likable spectacle on something of a budget. This lost plateau is home to virtually endless hostile clans, travelers, and of course dinosaurs (although, where all the food for everyone comes from is somehow never brought up...) But it's fun, so why argue?",1348358400,,379,4.9375
2002791,5,B0001I2CFC,"Here is another DVD, set from something from the past I am just greatful that I can watch them again thanks god for DVD tv, shows",1342310400,,129,4.0
2002792,5,B0001I2CFC,I could not wait to get this season in the mail. I loved watching this series on tv and I just love watching it over and over again!,1340928000,,132,3.75
2002793,5,B0001I2CFC,"I have this same set of dvds of my own I received as a gift.  My grandson visited with us last summer and loved ""The Lost World"" episodes but was only able to watch a few of them so I decided to order the 3 sets (including this one) from Amazon to give him for Christmas and his birthday.  Unlike some movies, the entire family can watch these episodes together. My husband and I use to watch the episodes on tv a few years ago and looked forward to watching each one of them.  We were really happy when our daughter gave the three sets to us for Christmas a couple years ago.",1296172800,,576,4.079646017699115
2002794,5,B0001I2CFC,"This was a great series. Wish the producers could have at least finished the series in a good manner. All the characters were great and O'Dell, of course, was the best. Good to see her acting in other shows. Had to buy this to complete the set.",1279670400,,244,4.212765957446808
2002795,5,B0001I2CFC,"Enjoyed watching when it was on the air, and now we can enjoy it at our leisure whenever we wish",1279065600,,96,3.85

 Thanks!",1271376000,,94,5.133333333333334
2002797,4,B0001I2CFC,"I highly recommend purchasing ""The Lost World - Season Two"" dvd. Its one of the best Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's television series that I've seen so far.",1265760000,,150,4.592592592592593
2002798,4,B0001I2CFC,"I loved the sci-fi show Lost World when it was on in reruns and would get up at 7:00am just to see it. Now I can buy it and sleep in. All kidding aside the series was a take off on the well known story by A.C. Doyle with the same name. They do not stick to the story for obvious reasons, a three year series would quickly run out of story lines if they stuck to the book so they used creative license to make up fantastic new stories.

By season three they had run out of ideas and it shows with the very long stretch of imagination that you have to use to go along with many of the episodes that were shot that year. They have episodes that include a ghostly flying airship that is doomed to repeat its crash over and over, a take off on the Jack the Ripper story that has Jack the Ripper's knife appearing along with two men one of whom or both may be the real Jack the Ripper, a hanging rope that suddenly appears to take one of them back in time to the old west and other stories.

What makes season three the most worth watching to me is the growing romance between Lord John Roxton and Margurite. Their chemistry is awesome. Their characters slowly learn to trust and open up to one another and by the end of this season they come together in my favorite episode that has them trapped in a cave under ground alone. They do what comes natural and although you never see more than a kiss it is one hot kiss that makes it clear what happened next.

If you want to watch a fun show that doesn't tax your brain too much this one is for you. My young son loves it and we watch it together. It is good at what it is, a fun interesting stretch of the imagination.",1213056000,,1661,4.042553191489362
2002799,5,B0001I2CFC,"TLW is an awesome show!!! And season2 is my favorite! It's unlike any other TV shows. TLW is different and in a very very good way! :)))

I say, AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!",1190592000,,174,4.4375
2002800,5,B0001I2CFC,"I am Continually impressed with the production values, especially for a show that came out every week. The location shots are worth the viewing alone. The characters are good, with enough sense of togetherness that you care about watching them. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys adventure type shows.",1176163200,,307,5.285714285714286
2002801,4,B0001I2CFC,"Bought Season 1 for my husband.  My Son(14 years old) liked them so much I bought him season 2.  He said they were great, but the last episode is a continuation to Season 3, so now I gotta go buy that one.  He was a little annoyed about the cliffhanger.  But I have to say this is a good series and I am glad we started watching them, which we do as a family (ages 11 and up).  They can be intense for younger veiwers.  But better than anything on TV now.",1169078400,2,455,3.891304347826087
2002802,5,B0001I2CFC,Each season was great. There was alot of action. I was sorry to come to the end.,1152662400,,80,3.764705882352941
2002803,4,B0001I2CFC,"I have seen these episodes on TNT and on Tv.com and I still say that season one of The Lost World is still better than this season. Only twenty of these twenty two episodes are good and that is why I gave this four stars instead of five like I did season one. I still do intend to buy this when I get the chance though. Like I said, this seas on is still good.",1127952000,3,360,3.8133333333333335
2002804,5,B0001I2CFC,"After watching the first season on DVD I was instantly hit with the desire to buy the second season when it came out. So after I bought it and brought it home I watched every single episode from start to finish. The next day I was tired, yet still a big fan......

  The story continues with the small band of survivors, George Challenger, Margarite Crew, Ned Malone, and John Roxton. Arthur Summerlie is not here because in the last season he fell off the bridge during the battle with one of the tribes. Anyway the stories are diverse and interesting, which keeps this season interesting all the way through.

  The best episodes would have to be The Pirates Curse, which has everyone searching for a treasure chest, including some very nasty pirates. Another great show would be The Games, where are old friend, Tribune returns, who is like the fox in a fox hunt, being hunted by his former soldiers.

  He forces our heroes into helping and in the end both he and Roxton are chained together in a Roman galdiator type tournament. My personal favorite episode when it comes to action and comedy.

Other great episodes would be:

The outlaw: where Margarite is accused of thievery, and thrown in jail. She was great in that episode.

The mark of the beast: Where everyone but Veronica turns into an animal after touching a stone with a weird mark on it. Challenger turns into a goat, Margarite a snake, Ned a bird, and Roxton a panther. He was creepy, but in a good way in this one.

And the Voodoo Queen: Where Roxton becomes obessesed with a woman who claims that an ape man army destroyed her village. Turns out her story is anything but close to what she says.

The other episodes aren't bad either, and some of you might find them even better than what I though. Thats up to you.

  The special effects are still as good, for a tv series, as the last season had. I still have to hold back a laugh when I see the T-Rex run after the explorers, and the ape men are great. I would definately reccommend this season to anyone who is a fan of this tv series.

  As for the acting, Roxton still proves he is the man that you should rely on in a fight, he leads several great roles in some of the episodes. But the others are great too, especially my favorite, Veronica! Anyway, cough cough, I really cant wait for the third season to come out, as for this, buy it today!",1096848000,15,2371,4.394495412844036
2002805,5,B0001I2CFC,"If you love adventure mixed with romance, and you love great acting, you will love The Lost World Season 2.  All the actors are great, and I love the stories that the writers come up with.  It's a fun-filled and action-packed show.  I recommend getting this along with Season 1!

The Covers are most excellent (you have to check out the Challenger cover!) I could watch The Source and Mark Of The Beast all day.  There are several great episodes including the dreaded VooDoo Queen gotta love the woman's tude :D,1088121600,4,393,4.342465753424658
2002808,5,B0001I2CFC,"If you thought the First Season was good then you are going to absolutely LOVE the Second Season!  Like mentioned by another reviewer, this season as some of the best episodes from the entire series.  ""The Outlaw"" is wildly entertaining and truly gives the usually thought of ""selfish and greedy"" Marguerite Krux the chance to show us what she's really made of.  Lord John Roxton (the charming hunk) kicks some serious butt in ""The Games"" all the while being chained to his shady (and always amusing) friend, Tribune.  (Yep, ladies and gents, our favorite green man makes another appearance.)  And I have yet to hear anyone say that they don't like the ""The Pirate's Curse"" where Marguerite lights up the screen with her dazzling smile and sparkling diamonds.  Furthermore, Season Two has one of the best season finales I have ever seen.  So, don't miss out on your chance to experience all the adventure, mystery, and romance of the plateau!",1088035200,5,942,4.85

8012807,3,B0001I2CFC,With all due respect the price you are asking is completely outrageous. I can see 40 to 50 $ maybe but over 200$ I don't think so. There is far too much I can do with that amount of money so I'm not going to spend it on one season of a tv show. If you ever make as reasonable offer like 45$ I will think about other wise you can keep it and good luck to you.,1487462400,,358,3.6025641025641026
