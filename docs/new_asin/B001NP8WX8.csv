8327587,4,B001NP8WX8,"I like this series,I would love it if it had Episode two included. It shows a different side of Gordon Ramsay, a fun, laughing chef who loves his work.",1325808000,,151,4.241379310344827
8327588,2,B001NP8WX8,"This is one of the best food shows, and what 'Emeril Live' should have been. But Series 2 has one GLARING problem. It's missing episode 2. Someone at BFS needs to speak up and explain why a box set supposedly containing nine episodes of the second series of The f Word ends up only offering eight. A quick glance at the DVD case indicates (in very, very small print) that Episode Two is omitted from the collection ""due to clearance issues.""
Those in the know may recognize this installment as the legendary meeting between Ramsay and UK pop idol Cliff Richard. Rumor has it that the former hitmaker was/is livid over the inference that he used the verboten curse word during the program and will not allow his likeness to be part of this DVD release. Oh brother! Thanks, Cliff, for F'ing up an otherwise great DVD set. Wanker!",1319068800,,827,4.557046979865772
8327589,3,B001NP8WX8,"I love Gordon and I love all his shows but how can a dvd set be released missing an entire episode?!
5 stars for Gordon.  3 stars for not having the complete season.  Boooo.",1316736000,,173,4.0588235294117645
8327590,5,B001NP8WX8,"Gordon Ramsay brings cooking home with involving his children and wife through actually catching and raising the meat that he wants to use.  There are always fresh markets he travels to for choosing so many various fresh ingredients, however, I enjoy watching him working with his family at raising and catching fresh meats.  My son has Crohn's disease and I have to be careful to choose and find the properly raised meats for him.  This is an inspiration to us.",1252627200,,462,4.75
8327591,5,B001NP8WX8,"I wonder what the clearance issues were for Episode two?  BBC America still broadcasts Episode Two.  I wonder if it has to do with Cliff Richard or something. I Couldn't find anything but the synopsis for the episode.
