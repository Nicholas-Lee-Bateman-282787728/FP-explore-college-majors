8665619,3,B00LFN02D6,"As you might be able to guess from the DVD cover, this is comedy slasher that attempts to pay homage to 80's film. In a plot, not well developed, Cherry Skye (Amber Sajben) must stop the gates of hell while battling fellow skater Hell Grazer (Rachael Blackwood) over a boyfriend Hell dumped and Cherry picked up on the rebound...again not well understood.

The film used professional roller derby women. The production wasn't well scripted with some of the best scenes being ad lib. The movie has a lot of music and bands and the DVD extras include videos by several bands. I enjoyed ""The Dark Shadows"" which showed a ""Concrete Blonde"" influence. The film had good scenes, but the plot was no where. I enjoyed the actors, unfortunately it was poorly directed/scripted. There is a commentary film which was a zoo as a half dozen people all speak at once...and Amber Sajben is far from the sweet innocent she plays in the film. I did like her costumes with the ears on the hoodie. In the outtakes, Daisy Masterman kept forgetting her lines, which I thought was odd with all the ad lib scenes.

This was the flat rink roller derby and not the wooden banked derby I grew up with. There were no arm locks, no sling shots, just women in hose and hot pants skating around in a circle with an occasional elbow and fall. While the film claims it is ""cult"" the 20 minute plot poorly stretched into a feature film didn't make it. Psych (as Cyndi Lawbreaker) a professional skater, did a great job acting.

8665621,3,B00LFN02D6,"""""A campy ozploitation with Italian Giallo undertones and a supernatural core. ""MurderDrome"" rocks, literally, with great pyschobilly tracks [..] in the confines of a cavity heavy plot for a film more suitable as a music video than a feature flick. In the end, ""MurderDrome"" provides an endearing look upon horror even with all the obvious flaws, but renders some nice moments of searing barbarity overshadowing, just slightly, some of the misfires.""

The acting is sub-par there are some good one liners, some annoying characters with awful special effects. however if you are a fan of mindless gore, a ridiculous story plot, creepy janitors and mystic roller rinks I'd give it a go.",1454371200,,332,4.842105263157895
8665623,5,B00LFN02D6,"While this is not the best movie in the world, it is a cheese-filled fun adventure. It helps to have a bit of roller derby in your blood to enjoy the movie, otherwise it just feels like a really cheap horror movie not quite worth watching. I cannot say that I would recommend this movie to everyone, but would gladly tell anyone who likes roller derby and horror to at least give it a shot (if you like B-horror flicks). It's fun, pretty stupid, and doesn't have a whole lot of plot or budget to make anything spectacular, but it definitely earns some originality points for being one of the few derby-related horror films to ever be made.",1448928000,2,639,4.423728813559322

Well, it definitely was horrible and was actually worse then what we expected. Still a fun watch, but I am glad I did not buy it.",1419638400,,247,4.276595744680851

8665627,5,B00LFN02D6,"Murderdrome is the best indie horror movie I've ever seen and easily the best movie ever come out of Australia.  It's Kitch and Gore style is what grabbed me.  This movie is going to stay within arms length at all times.  "" Attack of the Killer Tomatoes "" got nothing on this.  This movie has everything.  Cute girls in short shorts. A great thrashing soundtrack. Gore, Gore, and more Gore along with all those sexy Australian accents.  If you like B Horror then this is the movie for you.  This will be my go to roller derby murder movie.  Got it just in time for Halloween and can't wait to share it!",1411084800,,602,4.3125
