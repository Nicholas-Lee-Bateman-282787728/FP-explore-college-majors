8482496,5,B005PK0ZU0,"Mirai Nikki, aka The Future Diary, has set the standard for me, as far as modern anime is concerned. This series is the perfect blend of drama, romance, horror, comedy, mystery, and action. Picture Death Note meets Gantz meets Higurashi, this series has become an instant classic. This story follows Yukiteru Amano, a keeps to himself teenage loner that finds himself tangled up in a high stakes game of life and death, the winner of which is to become a God. At the center of this frenzy of death and carnage is Yuno Gasai, the local hotty with a handy talent of turning people into corpses. However, is she an island, a safe haven, in the ocean of blood that Yukiteru navigates? Or is she the most dangerous enemy of all?

If all you want from anime is the typical shonen, Naruto/Bleach/One Peice type of show, then this show may not be for you. If you want a work of art, a true masterpiece of animation, then look no further.

The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack fantastic, and the characters are deep and complex, and as emotionally compelling as you can imagine. The ending is tragic, and happy, and beautiful all at the same time. If I could give this series 10 stars I would.",1366329600,5,1188,4.52093023255814

I loved it.

It follows the trials of complete loner Yuki Amano, whose only friends are Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space, and Murmur, his assistant. They aren't real. He created them in his mind to fill the void of having no friends and an only somewhat present family.

About ten minutes into episode one, we find out that Deus and Murmur are in fact real, and have been controlling what goes on in his imagination for the past few years. Deus is looking for a successor to the throne of God, and gave twelve people (including Yuki) the ability to predict the future through various objects of significance to them. The twelve are then instructed to kill each other, and the last man standing will take the throne.

The second diary holder happens to be a girl in Yuki's class, Yuno, whose diary does literally nothing but tell her what Yuki is doing in ten minute intervals. It soon becomes apparent that not only is she stalking him, Yuno is a psychopath. She kills innocent people with little thought of it if she even thinks they might threaten her relationship with Yuki. It's a little weird.

Although he does not want to, Yuki ends up having to ally with Yuno in order to survive the game. Whether or not this is a good idea is a big question.

Some things you should know before watching this series:
1. Length: It is 26 episodes of anime standard 24 minutes.
2. Soundtrack: Some is awesome, some is only so-so. I do have all of the music and learned a few songs from it on the clarinet, piano, and saxophone, if that tells you what I thought.
3. Voices/Sub: It is not yet in dub format. Funimation has recently purchased the rights to it, and it will be released in dub soon, but I watched it in fansub. The speaking subtitles were of average quality, and I could read them without having to pause, but I did have to pause often to read what was written in the diaries. Keep a remote handy, as there is lots of pausing to be done.
EDIT: Dub came out. Dub is good.
4. Story: Starts out a little weak, but it gets better.
5. Complexity: Pay attention to absolutely everything that happens- EVERYTHING- and you might come close to predicting the ending. Apparently, you can figure out part of it by paying attention to colors used in the opening credits. Maybe if you take longer to watch it and more time to think you may have more luck than I did, but I burned through it in three days.
6. Animation: The faces and figures are well-drawn, but it's a little odd to see that the world they live in looks like they stepped into a PS3 game- everything is in detailed 3DCGI other than people. I also suspect 9's hair in episode 2 was computer animated.
7. Cheesiness: It's very, very cheesy. When 7 started talking about the power of love, I almost drowned in the metaphorical cheese.
8. Romance: It has its fair share of lovey-dovey crap. Romance is actually an important part of the story, but I generally don't enjoy the overly romantic scenes. A few episodes had a bit of this. Justified in that the audience is supposed to recognize how unhealthy Yuki and Yuno's ""relationship"" is, but I found some parts to be a bit too much for me to stomach. There is also another couple who brag about how much ""stronger"" their love is than the protagonists'. I found that scene particularly irritating. However, there is a scene in episode 20 that manages to be both romantic and so funny I had to stop the episode and calm down.
9. Protagonist Stupidity- Yuki is a complete moron. It almost made me stop watching. I didn't, though, and I'm glad.
10. Content- The series is rated ""R"" for violence, gore and mild nudity. You should know I watched the clean edit. Gore was fuzzed out. As far as the mild nudity, there are a few scenes that can certainly be considered questionable. At one point, Yuno is swimming and her bikini top floats off, but nothing is shown. 9 is kidnapped and chained to a wall wearing nothing but her underwear, but her hair covers just about everything. Later on, Yuno spends an entire episode pretty much walking around in a bra and lacy underwear. The lighting in that portion is very dim, though. One character has rape as part of her back story, and attempts to arrange the rape of another. Nothing happens, however. The biggie is that yes, there is a sex scene. I did not watch it. I looked up where it was and skipped it. I'm a high schooler, and I don't want my mother to kill me for watching inappropriate things. Anywho. I was told that the sex scene in the manga is ""shockingly explicit"", but I didn't read the manga. I do not know how explicit the anime is. As previously noted, I watched the clean edit.
11. Fight Sequences- I watched Soul Eater, and it's pretty difficult to not raise your standards significantly after that. At first, the fight scenes were pretty boring, but then became ok-ish, and then by the end of the series were pretty respectable.
12. Characters- Each of the twelve diary holders is a special and unique snowflake, developed as well as they could be in twenty six episodes. Reasons for joining the competition ranged from bringing back dead loved ones, saving dying family members, believing they could do a better job than Deus(She's my favorite. I love her.) and just thinking killing other people is fun. There is an interesting setup regarding who is given the most attention. We are most sympathetic towards the terrorist who blows up schools and churches, and least sympathetic towards the five-year-old boy who just lost his parents. It's pretty screwed up, but you can tell a lot of thought was put into this.
13. Prior Knowledge- I recommend this to those who have seen at least one anime before, or read a manga. Some understanding of Japanese honorifics is required, and if you absolutely must watch this I suggest you look them up on WIkipedia before beginning. This series is one of my firsts that actually takes place in Japan, so it was a bit confusing to me to watch things like courtship rituals and eating traditions.

Overall, I give it five stars. Despite the fact that the cheese and romance was very, very irritating, the plot moved quickly enough to keep my limited attention and there were enough surprises to make me genuinely interested. In fact, I have decided that I may cosplay one of the characters(9) for Halloween next year. Maybe.",1356480000,4,6375,4.528645833333333
8482498,5,B005PK0ZU0,"A closer look at the story:
The series is pretty fantastic. I gave it the two episode rule on a whim and was hooked. The plot is pretty straight forward, but you only really have the main character's (Yukiteru ""Yuki"" Amano) perspective on the events most of the time. This leads to some intentional ambiguity of the other characters motivations. This coupled by the intense paranoia of the second main character, Yuno Gasai, is enough to keep things interesting. It's brutal and twisted and heartbreaking all at the same time. Sakae Esuno does such a brilliant job of creating well-rounded and balanced characters. many will inspire you to clench in horror and recoil from the screen, while at the same time thinking, ""I totally get where they're coming from."" By the end of the series, you're not really sure who you're suppose to be pulling for anymore. It also seamlessly blends realistic portrayals with the obviously weird diaries. For those of you who read the Amazon description and think this will be too similar to Battle Royale, rest assured it is not.(Although it does share some superficial similarities.) This is a very serious drama not to be engaged in lightly. I'm also not sure this is the anime you should start on if you're new to the genre. It's extremely violent and quite gory, with some implied sex, although I don't believe it's explicitly shown. However, if you're in the mood for something absolutely outstanding and you find Boogiepop Phantom too confusing (or even if you enjoyed Boogiepop Phantom) this is for you.

As for the dvd itself:
I've seen some rips of this floating around online and the video quality looks pretty fantastic. I heard a rumor that these DVDs are being fansubbed, so the officials don't have subtitles. I'm not sure if this has been confirmed. However, the region code (2, which means it won't play in standard U.S. or Canadian dvd players which are region 1) might mean that there is some validity to these claims.",1343001600,2,1969,4.808259587020649
