8591633,4,B00DCBKT28,"There are many low-budget horror flicks out in the market today, but some of them simply do not have heart.  Sure, these duds try to scare and make you jump, but most of them come across as flat and lifeless, as if the film crew got together and decided to make a movie on a weekend whim.  I'm very happy to report MVD's recent release UNSOLVED does not fit into that category.  Although it is a low budget film, it has more heart than some big budget pictures, and it entertains more so as well.

It might interest you to know that this film was shot and produced by the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City.  This is significant for me because that's only three hours away from where I live.  Not to mention the fact that this film is fun and well made for a school film.

UNSOLVED is shot well for a low-budget picture and looks good overall.  The acting is not too great, but you can't expect too much in a production situation like this.  The script is pretty well written, and the story is pretty good, although I pegged the killer about halfway through the film.

There are not many special effects in the film, but those we do see are pretty good.  We basically get some nice blood splatters here and there when the killer strikes.  Still, many low-budget films use cheap looking blood effects; not so here.  The blood looks good and thick in this film, adding a depth of realism to it.

I recommend UNSOLVED to those of you who enjoy good, cheap horror.  You can tell the production team put their hearts and souls into this film, and it shows onscreen.  I can't wait to see what these guys do next.",1380672000,,1611,4.337792642140468
