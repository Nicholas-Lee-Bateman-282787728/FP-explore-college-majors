6160390,5,B00HETDQLA,"Back cover clearly states these cartoons were previously released. While it is understandable that fans are anxious for new to DVD or Blu Ray cartoons to be released I don't understand why the comments state people are upset by this release. Its as though you think by releasing this disc Warner Bros is prevented from releasing new to DVD/Blu ray cartoons. There are many people who can't afford to spend more than $10 for a set of cartoons. Warner Bros should be thanked for making these cartoons available at a low price.

Rumors are that there will be a Vol 3 Looney Tunes blu ray set this year. Chances are most of the tunes will have previously been released on the Golden Collections as was the case with first 2 volumes. Perhaps the blu rays are the sets you should complain about if you are satisfied with the quality of the DVDs and want new to DVD cartoons to be released.",1389139200,6,883,4.484472049689441

6160392,1,B00HETDQLA,"""Looney Tunes Center Stage Vol. 1"" is just another name for disc 3 of the first ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection,"" which was the very first official release of Looney Tunes on DVD. If you own that, then you already own this disc.

I don't have anything against double dips, but at least have the decency to mix the cartoons around in an order that we don't already have. I bought both Platinum Collections, and the 50 cartoon best of, and those were double dips. But I won't be buying this release.",1387324800,20,497,4.461538461538462
