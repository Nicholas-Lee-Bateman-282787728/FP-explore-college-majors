7863592,3,6304108885,"I remember when this series came out on TV.  I was very excited that they were showing American Indians in a pretty good light.  I was disappointed that the series ended after only a few episodes.  I'm not an expert on the French and Indian War, but it seems fairly accurate to me.  I'm not sure if I agree with the Indians torturing their captive, but most else is good.  Costumes are okay.  Acting is pretty good.  Some humor.  The quality of the filming is pretty good for such an old tape.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes.",1297641600,,550,4.313725490196078
7863593,4,6304108885,"The Pro! This is a pretty good series representing the frontier days. The brave and stalward hero and the stunning leading lady.  Lee Horsley and the gorgeous Lynda Carter star.
The Con? VHS only.  }:o)",1262217600,,202,4.742857142857143
7863594,5,6304108885,"I met and married my very own 'Hawkeye' about five years after this show came and went. It was really enjoyable, entertaining TV, oh, so much better than horrible staged 'reality shows' and everything else that's on. Recently my outdoorsy husband was extolling the virtues of Lynda Carter, and I said 'hey -- do you remember that show she was on -- Hawkeye?' Indeed he did! So this will be a fitting anniversary present -- only I wish it were a DVD!!!!",1168905600,,452,4.524390243902439
7863595,5,6304108885,"The only bad comment I can make about Hawkeye is that the series only lasted one season.  This pilot film has all of the right elements--it was created by Stephen J. Cannell; stars Lynda Carter and Lee Horsley have great chemistry; great detail went into the construction of a British fort used in the series; all of the filming was done on location in Vancouver which means tons of breath-taking scenery.  The viewer is immediately pulled back into the throes of the French and Indain War.  There are 3 episodes of this series that can be found on video.  I would recommend all of them.  My only other request is that the series will eventually find its way to DVD, with tons of extras of course.",1104019200,8,697,4.5
7863596,5,6304108885,"This was an excellent portrayal of frontier life by Lee Horsley and Linda Carter.

Have been looking forever for it to come out on DVD.

It has a flavor of the English and French conflict and the brutality of the time.

I loved L.C.'s comment of how her character fell in lust with L.H.'s character.

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED FOR A CHARACTER LOVE STORY.",1100390400,4,351,4.612903225806452
7863597,5,6304108885,"I had a recurring role as a British Soldier (non speaking part) in Hawkeye and it was a great show to be on. It was filmed ENTIRELY on location in a purpose built fort in the Seymour watershed of Vancouver B.C. Linda C. was GREAT to work with and an elegant lady!  All of the soldiers in the series were ex military or young militia guys and there was also a set historian to keep things in proper historical context. I am a bit older and had a ""look"" about me so I got to do lots of mean things like shooting a native woman in the back, hanging a young innocent guy and stuff like that! We were kept under ""military discipline"" from the moment we got on set in the morning till end of day. i.e. we had ranks as per military and we marched onto the set each morning to fife and drum, ran up the flag and gave it the old ""God Save the King"" business. Then we would march out and over to the holding area and await our scenes. Some of the guest directors were stunned and most pleased to see us marching up in the morning to the fort. As a result of this when it came to doing battle scenes we had a very good discipline on the set amid all the chaos that ensues in filming battles. It was a great relief for them to work with troops who had previous experience operating under fire! It was a blast but I have never bothered to do it again (act) as I am a writer (search amazon for a book by me) but it was an experience  I will never forget. I bought a vhs copy of the episode THE SEIGE on amazon today.",1077062400,5,1502,3.9701986754966887
7863598,5,6304108885,"This was a wonderful, family oriented series and it is a shame that it was taken off the air . Lee Horsley is a very versitile,
and talented actor and gave the Hawkeye character warmth, moral integrity and  strong, manly attributes. I highly recommend
this video. I hope that a syndicated network will bring this series back",1023753600,6,324,4.684210526315789
7863599,5,6304108885,"As a big fan of Lynda Carter, Lee Horsley, Rodney Grant,  and American History - this was the perfect video for me.  It is beautifully acted and  scripted with breathtaking scenary and a hauntingly beautiful opening  theme. For those who  appreciate period pieces, of which there are far too  few, I highly recommend this entire series. It's a real shame that this  quality show was taken off the air far too prematurely.",967420800,10,421,4.763888888888889
7863600,4,6304108885,"I enjoyed Hawkeye especially because of the beautiful Lynda Carter. Her acting abilities get better with each film and television show that she  makes. This is one of my favourites because it is a real departure and has  action, tragedy and drama. There are 2 or 3 videos to this series and I  recommend them. I also enjoyed 'Hawkeye:Siege' which is the next  installment. I highly recommend it for action fans, for Lynda Carter fans  and for fans of period shows like ""Dr Quinn"". Quite a treat!",965174400,4,495,4.64367816091954
