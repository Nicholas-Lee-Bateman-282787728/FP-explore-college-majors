3157484,5,B0016K76WS,I remember watching these cartoons back in the 80's/90's and loving the artwork and concept.  I was quite pleased to bring back these classic cartoons...,1279843200,,153,5.12
3157485,5,B0016K76WS,"I'd vaguely remembered this series from when I was a kid. Since I love a good trip down memory lane, I decided that I'd recheck this series out. It's almost as good as I remembered it. There's a lot that is more enjoyable as a kid, but there's also a lot of stuff that I appreciate more as an adult. Like another reviewer put it, the characters in this cartoon all represent various character types of teenage life. While this series does try to send out a message, they also make the attempt to make the series enjoyable as well.

The plot centers around Doyle (an athlete who chose to not study) as well as the brainy Amy, who is the smartest girl in school. The show tries it's best to show how important school is (Amy gets a scholarship & pretty much everything she always wanted such as clothes, friends, ect while Doyle ends up working at a pizza parlor to make ends meet) while showing that with a bit of hard work anyone can succeed.

I'm debating showing this to my nephews & niece. It's much more entertaining than most of the cartoons out today, that's for sure.",1214956800,6,1074,4.365
3157486,5,B0016K76WS,"This was actually a phenomenal cartoon of the 80s and it is sad it did not last long. It centers around the jock Doyle and the smart geeky girl Amy. They go to high school in outer space and Amy suddenly becomes popular. Doyle becomes the outcast who has to prove himself. What makes this cartoon so great is that we have aliens who are exaggerations of the human condition. (Gilda Gossip the gossip girl has several mouths.) Doyle is befriended by the geeky, but kind hearted and smart Milo.

Doyle is an interesting main character in that he is neither remarkably altruistic, nor remarkably selfish. At his worst, he is either full of himself such as in ""It Came From Earth,"" or his faults hurt his friends around him such as in ""The Brain Blaster."" At his best, he is the voice of reason who holds everyone together such as in ""Where's Milo?"" Doyle's arguably greatest moment is in ""Where's Milo?"" Milo messes up and makes several people angry at him; he disappears, and most of the gang is happy about his disappearance, and Doyle reminds everyone how kind Milo was to them.

Another interesting character is the jock bully Beef Bonk. He picks on Doyle and doesn't always get a just comeuppance. In ""The Beef Who Would Be King,"" he is especially bad after he is ungrateful to Doyle for saving his life. But he does show a gentle side in ""The Brat Pack"" as well as a willingness to work with Doyle. It is probably worth noting that in ""Where's Milo?"" he accidentally saves the day. In some episodes like ""Pizza's Honor,"" he gets a just comeuppance. (So this cartoon was groundbreaking in that we have a bad guy who gets the last laugh sometimes, accidentally saves the day now and then, will work with hero under the right circumstances, or get a just comeuppance sometimes.)

The episode I consider best is ""Those Eyes, Those Lips."" Booey wants a ticket to see Mick Maggers, and the Galaxy High gang works so hard to get her a ticket. The series most popular episode was probably ""The Brain Blaster."" (An obvious take on drugs.) ""It Came From Earth"" is an interesting episode that shows the possible futures of the gang. 2 characters worth mentioning are the elderly married couple the Blastermeyers who are always bickering. (Myrtle) ""Why are you getting off here? This is a terrible place! Harvey! Tell him how dangerous it is!"" (Harvey) ""Myrtle! Mind your own business!"" It is worth mentioning that in ""Beach Blanket Blow Up"" they help save the day for the whole gang. Overall, it's a great cartoon that showed different aspects of the human condition. It's sad it didn't last long.",1214956800,12,2589,4.636165577342048

8262882,5,B0016K76WS,"When i saw this available I was ecstatic, I mean there are so few of my old Saturday morning cartoons out there for purchase, the one's i liked anyway. So when I saw it I was excited and that excitement stayed with me.
  I mean I was actually expected to be let down a little because it usually seems like the things i liked as a child can't stand up my idea of what it used to be.
  The day it arrived I unwrapped it and put the first DVD in my player and instantly I was transported back to ""my 80's"". I was taken back so well that I actually got a bowl of cereal and wrapped myself in a blanket on the couch just to watch. I think my room mate and his girlfriend was most surprised when they came into the room to see a 37 year old guy sitting on the couch on his knees wrapped in a blanket with a bowl of cap'n crunch and a smile from ear to ear watching cartoons. hehe
  The DVD packaging was as expected and exactly what you see here, the picture quality and sound was good though the aspect ratio is  standard 4:3 so expanding it to fit your wide screen tv either stretches it or cuts off a portion of the video. So if you can get past that I fully recommend this wonderful piece of 80's memorabilia.",1402531200,,1207,3.983402489626556
8262883,5,B0016K76WS,I was looking all over for this cartoon in particular and I have it now! I tried ordering it for a local video store and they couldn't. So I looked on here and found it. This cartoon brings back so many childhood memories. I never knew that they had a part two. So I had to get the Collection. I love it! I can't wait to show my sister when she comes down to visit this summer.,1393200000,,377,3.909090909090909
8262884,5,B0016K76WS,"I enjoyed watchin this series again. I watched it when it use to come on CBS in the 80's. My son enjoyed it too. So happy to have this series. I felt like a kid again. The characters in the cartoon series is cool, can't forget them. I love it, I love it as one of the characters would say. It's a cool cartoon series.",1378339200,,317,3.8923076923076922
8262885,5,B0016K76WS,"I bought this box set a while ago and it's still in my collection. This 13 episode series is about 2 teens from Earth, who were chosen. To enroll in the totally far out Galaxy High School, which is located far away from Earth. In another galaxy so after they arrive at their destination. Aimee the smart yet cute nerd girl,and Doyle the talented yet cocky jock. Were in for a surprise , Aimee for her astonishingly high grades. And good attendance gets rewarded, with a full scholarship and an interstellar spacecar  .And unfortunately for Doyle for his low grades, he has to get a job at the local pizzaria/ cafeteria. To pay his tuition,and if that,wasn't bad enough he gets into trouble. With the school bullies Beef and the Bonk Bunch. If your an 80's kid like me you should definitely get this boxset. And add it to you collection!!!!!",1377043200,3,840,4.562913907284768
8262886,5,B0016K76WS,"Galaxy High School was and still is one of my favorite cartoon t.v. shows of all time! Even some 20 years later is still holds up as  a funny and bittersweet take on high school..but this time around it's set in outer space with two teenage Earth exchange students!..Lol..Lol..Lol..Plus, the opening for the show still rocks and is consistently catchy.

However, I was so sad when it was cancelled after only one season! Galaxy High school should've been on the air longer! I remember waking up every Saturday morning to watch it! (We didn't have a VHS player/recorder back in the day!)

I especially loved Beef Bonk! He was such a bully and a grade 'A' tool! (Of course no one said that to his face because Beef Bonk was a 7 foot reptilian/chicken hybrid with super strength that turned green when angry!..Lol..Lol..)

It's really cool that they collected all 13 episodes into an affordable set. I know that I'm dreaming but I really would love it if they brought this cool series back with new episodes! Because Galaxy High left us hanging with a lot of loose plot-lines: like would Amy and Doyle get together and would the Bonk Bunch ever get their butts kicked by another student, and it would have been cool to end the series with the gang at Galaxy High School graduating from their Alma Mater!

Hey! It could happen....",1371859200,,1326,4.625531914893617
8262887,5,B0016K76WS,been looking for all the cartoons from my childhood and i am so glad i was able to order Galaxy High!  I am enjoying the episodes with my little girl!  She loves it to!,1371254400,,168,3.911764705882353
