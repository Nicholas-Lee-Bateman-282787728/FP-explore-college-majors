8572211,5,B00BPF1EYK,"This is a balm to an aching heart, so shot thru with goodness, wonder, love, compassion and possibilities that it is restorative.  As good (if not better) than Hayao Miyasaki's work, which I also love (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B074121MFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisper-of-the-Heart/dp/B000CDGVOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisper of the Heart</a>), or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Song-of-the-Sea/dp/B00TFVZXHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Song of the Sea</a>.  Shimmering, stunningly beautiful animation, lovely music, and inspired characterizations.  Even the subtitles are gorgeous, top notch, both visually (bright white on a black background) and lyrically/narratively.  But don't watch with the sound off- you must hear the character's voices and inflections.

Natsume's Book of Friends began as a manga (comic book) series, serialized from 2005- present (the first 20 of the 22 volumes to date are available on Amazon in both paperback and kindle formats).  It was adapted into an animated (anime) TV series, broadcast in Japan for six seasons, in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017.  The first four seasons are available on Amazon Prime Video.  Both the manga and anime versions are critically acclaimed, and embody the best of Japanese sensibilities.  I often watch the NHK Network on PBS because these sensibilities are not only intriguing but therapeutic- attention to detail and a love of craftsmanship and excellence for its own sake, an animistic orientation towards all living things and the world as a living whole, and care and compassion for others' feelings and welfare (especially evident in their attitudes toward elders and the care thereof, ditto with pets).  Such values are embodied in Natsume's Book of Friends, the notion that even the smallest and seemingly least significant of beings (e.g., frogs, cats, children) are of of equal importance in the scheme of things.

At the heart of this tale is a strange orphan boy's love for his deceased grandmother, who didn't quite fit into the world either.  The story jumps back and forth between two timelines, the boy's and his grandmother's at roughly the same age, in many ways pursuing twin paths.  Involved are supernatural spirits and forces, destiny, self-determination, discovering one's identity and purpose (along with going to high school and the pressures relating thereto).  Haunting and mysterious, there's also whimsy, humor, pathos, suspense, and INSPIRED storytelling.  Nothing is quite what it seems to be; the show channels the fears, hopes and dreams of a child's heart.  After one episode you may well be hooked like I was, I promptly bought all four seasons to savor.  Simply wonderful.",1510444800,2,2906,6.1182266009852215

8572215,5,B00BPF1EYK,"Takashi Natsume sees things that most people can not. Strange creatures called 'yokai' live along side us, interacting with the world, but unseen to most humans. Some are sweet and gentle, others are malevolent and dangerous. Together with his 'bodyguard' Nyanko-sensei, Natsume both battles and befriends the various yokai that come after him for the Book of Friends, a book that binds the names of many different yokai.

Natsume Yuujin-chou continues to delight. Strange yokai are introduced and dealt with and old friends return to visit. If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Natsume, you will enjoy this season as well. If you haven't see the first 2 seasons, you could probably jump in right here without too much confusion, but that would be a waste, so go watch the first 2 seasons!

The third season is 13 episodes long. The set is in the same format as the first one (which if you didn't' know, actually contains seasons 1 & 2). Everything comes stored in a long hardcover case that contains the complete series on 2 DVDs and the complete series on 2 Blu-ray discs. Also included (and probably the reason for the long case) is a full color, 32 page hardcover art book. It includes detailed character info, an episode guide, rough sketches, and Japanese BD/DVD package illustrations. The cover is modeled after the Book of Friends :)
This series does not have a dub, so the only audio option is Japanese.

BONUS If you buy this set through NIS America, not only is it cheaper (and has free shipping), but it also comes with 2 Nyanko-sensei keychains! The first season comes with a book bag. Its only while supplies last, but it seems that supplies are lasting quite a long time, so it is worth checking out.",1366934400,6,1716,4.694352159468439
