850657,5,6304361238,"This 60s era low budget horror flick is a fun film. Despite a really nasty opening that I can only describe as overly cruel, the film quickly settles into a groove of dark, campy humor from which it never deviates. Most of the performances are top-notch, especially by Lon Chaney, Jr. who turns in an exceptionally funny turn as the family retainer. All in all, your money is well spent on this dvd, which features a lost scene with Chaney not included in most prints of the movie. Well worth the cost, and a lot of fun.",999820800,,520,4.371134020618556
850658,4,6304361238,"What to write about THIS one? I have to be honest, this is a tough call to make, because I just haven't seen anything quite like this before, and maybe that's enough of a recommendation in itself. Some reviewers have likened it to ""The Addams Family"", but I'd say ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is  another candidate for comparison. The Merrye family suffers from a degenerative disease (""rots the brain"" - that's what my dad used to say about comic books!) which causes them to regress to, eventually, homicidal, psychopathic cannibals. There's no denying that Lon Chaney does a superior job as the family chauffeur and as the sole voice of reason in the madhouse. Carol Ohmart, as a relative visiting to reclaim the estate, reprises her sexy ice-queen role from ""House on Haunted Hill"", this time stripping down to the black lace (in one of the more gratuitous moments in a gratuitous movie!)
There's no gore, at least nothing like what you commonly see in today's poor excuses for ""horror movies"". In fact, the ""rat scene"" from ""Hideous Sun Demon"" is probably more of a pure gross-out than anything on camera in this movie. But the *implied* violence is there, in spades. And folks, it's weird. Do NOT expect to sit there and yawn. It may have been done on a low budget, but all that means is that today's directors are wasting money. ""Spider Baby""'s director, Jack Hill, did some work with Roger Corman before knocking this one off in a mere 12 days of shooting. The movie was lost in legal limbo for years, and that lack of exposure at a time when it could never have made it to television probably ensured it's future as a true ""cult"" film.
The print is excellent - no complaints at all. The missing 8 minutes isn't the usual well-deserved cut, either: in this case, they lopped off important background information. (I wish that they had restored it into the film instead of having it as an ""extra"", but hey! We're lucky to get ANYthing here!)
Bottom line: you can't call yourself a ""cult movie fan"" if you haven't seen this one. It is in no way similar in plot to ""Carnival of Souls"", but I'd have to say that it ranks right up there with that classic for pure strangeness.",987984000,63,2180,4.589743589743589
850659,4,6304361238,"After reading the other reviews of this movie, and being a Lon Chaney Jr. fan, my curiosity got the best of me, and I bought the movie. Wow! Take the Addams Family, make them crazier than they are and make them cannibalistic and you have the Merrye Family. This bunch would even scare off the Munsters.
I would also agree that this was Chaney's best performance following his success at Universal in the 1940s. He seemed to relish the role. Just listen to his sadistic gruffy voice as he sings the title song. There was definitely a spark there for him.
I also love the subliminal message sent across as they sat down at the supper table. When they start talking about the Universal horror monsters and how much they love the Wolfman. The camera cuts to Chaney, who goes back 20 years in time and says in his best Lawrence Talbot voice, ""The moon will be full tonight."" What a great flashback. I'll bet after finishing that scene, Chaney probably thought long and hard about those wonder years at Universal.
Spider Baby is definitely a cult classic that has probably been forgotten by many. I had never heard of it until I saw it here on Amazon. It's sick, but no more sick than some of the gory garbage they put out today with five gallons of ketchup flying everywhere.
Be aware of the Merrye family! Especially when Virginia wants to play spider!",985305600,2,1348,4.528688524590164

850661,5,6304361238,"I discovered this DVD a few weeks ago whilst browsing Amazon. I hadn't seen or heard of it before and simply bought it on a whim. It now ranks as  one of the most enjoyable movies in my collection. 'Spider Baby' is in a  different league to most other B-movies. The production is lifted by  excellent direction from Jack Hill and by a very capable and likable cast.  The real surprise for me was Lon Chaney's performance as the family  chauffeur. I'd half expected to see a washed up old horror star sadly  trying to emulate his past glories (a la Bela Lugosi in 'Plan 9 From Outer  Space'). Instead, Lon Chaney treats us to one of the best performances of  his career (honestly!) and shows what a great professional he was. The  movie benefits from a marvellous musical score, including the opening theme  which is sung by Mr Chaney himself. It really does have to be heard to be  believed. The storyline is surprisingly slow paced and there is little  on-screen gore or violence. Most of the horror occurs off camera and the  film relies on the weird characters and strange goings on to keep viewers  capitivated...and it succeeds brilliantly!
On the technical side, picture  quality is fantastic - exceptionally clean and sharp with very little sign  of wear and tear. The sound is single channel mono and is also very good.  The film is presented in its original widescreen 1.66:1 ratio. This is a  good size even if you don't own a widescreen set - the movie looked great  on my standard size 1.33:1 TV. The DVD also features an interesting  commentary by the film's writer and director Jack Hill. Jack has a very  easy going style and gives lots of behind the scenes info on the movie,  cast and crew. Spider verdict : a thoroughly enjoyable tongue-in-cheek  horror that comes highly recommended.",965606400,36,1802,4.650793650793651

This DVD includes 8 minites of long lost footage,  that was recently found when they where looking for a good print to use in  the transfer. Dvd includes a great little Documentery on the theatrical  re-release, with the aging cast remeniscing about to good ol' days, and  Jack hill answering a few questions for his cult following.

850786,2,6304361238,"I love vintage offbeat cinema but SPIDER BABY just didn't do it for me.

The story was too silly and so convoluted that a narrator had to explain the situation at the beginning and end of the picture. A good script would have not necessitated these expository bookends.

The attempts at quirkiness here fell terribly flat (such as Virginia eating real spiders, the family serving dead cat to dinner guests, etc.). This type of oddness was pulled off to much better effect on the original ADDAMS FAMILY TV serieswhich was wittier and funnier, too.

The only worthwhile parts are when the uppity Emily (Carole Ohmart) discovers her inner whore while admiring her lingerie-clad self in the bedroom and the uncomfortable scene when chair-bound Uncle Peter is being seduced by Virginia (Jill Banner). This type of B-movie needed more of these sleazy touches to give it an edge and look less like a 1960s sitcom.

The William Castle films from this period (HOMICIDAL, STRAIT-JACKET) are ten times more fun and entertaining than this.

I get it, that is: I understand why it developed a cult following, but I just couldn't get very excited by any of it.

850933,5,6304361238,"As I stated in my review of Swinging Cheerleaders, Jack Hill is a very unique and special director. With only a handful of films to his name, he managed to work in many different genres and brought his own unique touches to each one. Spider Baby was Hill's first solo film (though delayed for four years) and began his foray into horror, which was the genre most of his earliest films belonged in. After seeing Coffy, I had to find all of Jack Hill's films. This eventually led me to Spider Baby, which I watched several years ago and had been meaning to revisit. Arrow Film's new Blu Ray/DVD combo seemed like the perfect time to do just that.

Spider Baby, or the Maddest Story Ever Told, is a strange tale about the Merrye family. After the wealthy Titus Merrye passed away, he left his servant Bruno (Lon Chaney Jr.) to care for his three children, Ralph (Sid Haig), Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn) and Virginia (Jill Banner). The children have a rare disease that causes them to regress, both mentally and physically, until they become cannibal savages. Ralph's transformation is mostly complete while the two girls still seem normal, but act like little girls...very deadly little girls. The family then receive a letter stating that a pair of distant cousins are the true heirs to the Merrye fortune and come to the Merrye house to claim their inheritance.

Spider Baby, as I'm sure you can tell by the plot, is a weird movie. It's also a very fun and twisted movie. Chaney does a great job as the protective Bruno and Sid Haig is extremely creepy as Ralph (despite having no lines). The rest of the cast all excel and the camera work (by cinematographer Alfred Taylor), though being in black and white, is the real element that makes the film so creepy. The thing that struck me the most about the film is how much Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses (also starring Sid Haig) borrowed from the film. I always thought Zombie was trying to make his own Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it's evident that story wise, it was definitley more influenced by this film (the fact White Zombie has a song called Spiderbaby should have tipped me off too!). Arrow's new release of Spider Baby is the best this film has ever been presented, both in quality and in bonus features. It's good to see attention spent on such classic, cult films and Spider Baby definitely deserved the attention it was given. The black and white print looks pristine and there are a wealth of goodies included too. This film deserves another watch for cult, horror and exploitation film fans. Here are the full list of bonus features:

-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentation of the main feature,
-Original 2.0 Mono Audio (Uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)

850934,5,6304361238,"Wow!  How did I go this long without seeing this film?!  SPIDER BABY is one of those weird cult classics that I had always heard about, but had never seen.  In fact, I've had an earlier DVD release of this film in my collection for years, but had yet to watch it.  Well, that DVD is obsolete now thanks to the great folks over at Arrow Films.  Arrow continues to put out some of the nicest Blu-ray releases I have ever seen, and this one is no different.
This is definitely one of the weirdest and wildest films I have seen, and that is saying a lot!  I can't imagine how audiences reacted to this film back in the late 60's when it was originally released.  I am sure they had never seen anything like this before!

  While I sometimes shy away from older, black & white, horror films, I almost always end up really enjoying them.  The black & white is so nostalgic and it's a lot of fun coming across an old classic like this that I haven't seen before.  The picture quality looks amazing on this blu-ray.  Arrow always does a remarkable job with their blu-ray transfers, and this one is no different.

  I knew I was going to like this film from the opening credits, and the opening scene cemented this for me.  In the opening scene we see young Virginia lure a delivery man up to her house and to the window.  Little does the man know he is the 'bug' to Virginia's 'spider' in her sick and twisted game.  Once the 'spider' catches the 'bug', it's all over for poor Mr. delivery man.  Virginia, Elizabeth, and Ralph  (played by Sid Haig of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS) make up the trio of kids who do some awful things.  They are all mentally unstable and no one is safe when they are around!

  This was such a fun, weird, creepy film.  This is one I will definitely be watching again in the near future.  I highly recommend this one.  If you have never seen SPIDER BABY, do yourself a favor and pick up this new Blu-ray release asap!",1447200000,,1930,4.271468144044321
850935,5,6304361238,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

With so many movies being released year after year there are bound to be some that fall between the cracks when it comes to making appearances over and over again. Such is the case with SPIDER BABY. It made it to the drive-in circuit but never really got the full-fledged TV treatment that it deserved. It disappeared from sight for a number of years. But fans these days are known to be diligent if nothing else. The search went out, it was found and resurrected and now Arrow Video has released what is by far the best version of this movie you can find.

If you're not familiar with the story it tells the tale of the Merrye family, a family cursed with a disease that makes them grow older in age but regress in mentality, eventually becoming homicidal maniacs. The caretaker of the Merrye children is played by an aging Lon Chaney Jr. as Bruno. Bruno loves these children with his whole heart and would do anything to protect and care for them. He is not just dedicated to the family, they become his family as well.

The movie opens with famous celeb Mantan Moreland as a delivery man who makes the mistake of peeking in a window of the dilapidated house the family resides in. A quick drop of the window on his head finds him trapped and young Virginia Merrye (Jill Banner) coming at him in her spider mode, net ready to toss on him and then knives to serve as pincers. She kills him before she can get the message, one Bruno finds along with the body. It seems two distant relatives are on their way accompanied by their lawyer with the intent of taking over the family home, dilapidated though it may be.

This sends Bruno into crisis management mode where he tells the children they have to be on their best behavior. Along with Virginia are Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn) and Ralph (Sid Haig). Ralph is by far the most gone of the three being the eldest. Hes at a point where he cant even speak much less function. Keeping these three on their best will be a challenge for poor Bruno.

Its best not to go into detail as to what happens from here but know that the distant relatives Peter and Emily, a married couple with issues all their own, are not interested in whats best for the children. While Peter might care in some ways hes more interested in the secretary of the lawyer. Emily only has dollar signs in her eyes, hoping that there is enough to salvage from the home to make her a wealthy woman. They decide to spend the night and from there things begin to happen.

Shot in black and white on a miniscule budget, director Jack Hill gets the most for his money. Not only does he make the locations and sets work for him, he gets some tremendous performances from his cast. Chaney has never quite looked this good in roles he took later in life. The younger, newer members all present themselves quite well here. Banner does an exceptional job and its sad to realize that she didn't make enough after this film and died early at age 35. The originality of the story is something that is rare in most movies, even more so today, but to come up with something like this that reeks of exploitation but is made so well makes it astounding. I found myself caught up in all that was going on and never felt like I had to have the remote handy with my finger on the fast forward button.

The movie entertains and does so with ease. This becomes even more amazing when you delve into the extras that Arrow has provided, something they do better than anyone else, even Criterion (who will charge you far more for their wares). Included in the extras are:

* High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentation of the main feature, available in the UK for the first time

As always Arrow provides so much bang for your buck its a sight to behold. Ive gotten to the point where with new releases I actually dread the extras that they include. Blooper reels seem to have happened on set just to make the blooper reels. Information feels more like promotional pieces rather than information. But the ingredients that Arrow includes in their extras always seem to enhance the movie experience of what you are watching rather than be just tossed on to add something. Because of that when new Arrow titles arrive I am always excited to see them in the mail.

This release is not only a great lost treasure its been placed in a fabulous chest because of the efforts of Arrow Video. For horror fans or those who love lost movies, this is a must add to your collection.",1445904000,,5829,4.569377990430622

I loved this movie, and didn't think I'd ever get the chance to own it. Arrow Video however, saved the day. They have done remarkable work digging up facts and interviewing actors/actresses from the film, I watched every special feature, and I don't usually do that, lol. This company has put out a lot of great titles, granted most of them are region B/2 as it is a company from United Kingdom, but that's no problem for those in the states with region free players. Their new artwork covers actually remind me of old video covers, probably one of the biggest things I loved about going to the video stores as a kid and picking out movies was checking out the covers, the company doesn't hold back on special features, and the little booklets inside are great! I also love the ones that come with posters. As far as the film on hand, they did a great restoration job with the picture quality, the sound is good and the special features are great. Totally worth the price. The movie isn't without it's humorous moments, and watching the actors play off one another was great. Sid Haig is totally bizarre in his portrayal of Ralph, he kills me with his little boys school suit when they go to dine. I love that they got Lon Chaney to sing the intro to this as well.

851003,5,6304361238,"This is an excellent example of late 60s horror. The first kill happens fast, with minimal gore, but it is committed so nonchalantly by Emily the mentally regressed ""Spider Baby"" that it is extremely scary and disturbing. The rest of the story sustains and escalates this note of genuine terror. The two young sociopathic girls at the center of the plot are gorgeous and wonderfully demented, and can you believe that's SID HAIG playing their brother Ralf? Man, he was kind of a horror stud muffin in his early days. Save for that detail, I would have thought this film was made as early as this year. Very modern horror sensibility. And then to have Lon Chaney* say, ""There's a full moon tonight."" Lon Chaney. I was in ecstasy.

*It confused me at first when I saw his name in the credits...I thought, is THAT Lon Chaney, the Wolfman, the Phantom of they Opera, is he still kicking around somewhere???"" So I checked IMDB and, no, he died in 1930. (!) And only later did I realize that a) the film was released in 67, not 2013 as I'd suspected, and b) this was actually Lon Chaney, Jr, who died, alas, the year I was born, 1973. I'm sure that by the time he shot this he was really sick of standing in his father's shadow and took the ""Jr"" off to make a statement---and technically that's correct. You're only a junior or third or whatever until the person (people) you're named after die. Anyway, I'm not much into horror pre-1960, but I would like to check out more of this guy's work.

851005,5,6304361238,"I have no idea how this movie flew under my radar for so long?? As a lifelong horror movie fan, I feel like I've seen it all, from the old Universal Monsters to current flicks like ""Oculus"" and ""The Purge"". Now that I've watched ""Spider Baby"" it's almost impossible not to see how influential this film was on some of my favorites (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""House of 1000 Corpses""), and how this movie kind of bridges the classic horror films to the 1970's/1980's slasher boom.

As the movie opens (with a great theme song performed by Lon Chaney), we are told about a strange disease that afflicts the Merrye family. Apparently around the age of 10, the Merrye's begin to regress mentally while their bodies continue to grow. Currently residing in a crumbling mansion are three of the Merrye children, Ralph, Viriginia and Elizabeth. They are being cared for by longtime family chauffer Bruno. We soon see that the children are insane after they murder a courier delivering a package. The letter the courier delivers states that the estate is being taken over by some distant relatives, and they, along with their lawyer are showing up to take control of the kids and the property.

This movie can be downright creepy!! Sid Haig playing the bizarre man/boy Ralph is spooky and the murderous little sisters are wicked fun to watch. Lon Chaney does fantastic job, even here at the tail end of his career, Chaney give it his all and manages to convey some great emotion when he thinks he's going to lose control of the situation, and lose the kids.

""Spider Baby"" is definitely going into regular rotation for Halloween at my house!! If you love horror, be sure to check this unique film out.",1408924800,,1697,4.6879194630872485
851006,5,6304361238,"Over the years I've gotten burned by many of  the underground horror movies that have been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray. Promised the ultimate viewing experience by horror magazines or fan sentiment, several have been major letdowns. Many of them have been almost completely unwatchable except for maybe one or two scenes in each one-usually involving nudity.
So it was with some trepidation that I bought Spider Baby. It was after Sid Haig's appearance in The Devil's Rejects that I first came to hear about the Maddest Story Ever Told. I waited about a year after the release of the Special Edition to buy it then waited a few weeks more to watch it fearing yet another disappointment.
But boy was I wrong. Delightedly wrong.
Spider Baby was different from the impression I had about it originally. For one thing the movie was unusually performance oriented. In most horror movies there are maybe one or two actors that carry the load but not here. Every character in Spider Baby is interesting which is an extreme rarity for cult cinema. Only a few other examples like The Return of the Living Dead (80's) or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (70's)  will you find such a solid cast ensemble in a B movie. Maybe it isn't a coincidence that these are also the ones with black comedy mixed with horror. It's also light on the gore which is not surprising given its limited budget. An ear falling to the floor is about all there is to see.
Spider Baby introduces us to the Merrye family who, after generations of inbreeding, have developed a disease simply known as the Merrye Syndrome. Any child around age 10 begins to regress to a point intellectually where they are no longer capable of speech and also show signs of physical deformity. The final result is a descent into cannibalism. The afflicted children are Virginia, Elizabeth and Ralph. Ralph's condition is further along than his sisters' since he can't talk at all. Taking care of them is Bruno, the family's kindly chauffeur who had devoted his life to their father Titus. The opening scene is highly memorable as a messenger has arrived to bring a letter to the clan. However he falls into the ""spider web"" of Virginia who proceeds to kill him in gruesome fashion. This is where we see the severed ear. A furious Bruno discovers that two distant relatives are paying them a visit intending to take their house and their land for financial gain. They are Peter and Emily Howe, two siblings who stand to inherit the entire family fortune if they can get the Merryes out of the way. (At least I think they're siblings. Amazon's item description states them as husband and wife but Emily clearly refers to 'baby Peter brother' in their first scene together.) Emily is the greedy one licking her chops at the prospect of coming into money while Peter is the kinder, friendlier one. They arrive along with their cohort Schlocker and his pretty secretary Ann. Once they meet the Merryes and decide to spend the night that's when the fun begins.
It really isn't possible to describe everything that happens without ruining the movie. Spider Baby is so bizarre it must be experienced. But highlights include the family dinner scene where the entree is cat. A funny reference to Universal's Wolfman elicits a priceless reaction from Lon Cheney. And certainly you discover the lovely Jill Banner. With her smoky bedroom eyes she certainly catches and holds your attention. Her portrayal of Virginia is creepy, funny and innocent all at the same time. I'm surprised she didn't become a bigger name in cinema. As Sid Haig points out in the retrospective the camera clearly loves her.
Extras include a half hour retrospective on the making of the movie. Another extra includes director Jack Hill returning to the house where he shot the exterior scenes. The third highlights composer Ronald Stein who wrote Spider Baby's terrific score as well as several other cult flicks like Dementia 13.
Spider Baby isn't for everyone but its revival stands a as testament to its craftsmanship by a crew of actors and filmmakers who enjoyed dabbling in the mad and macabre.",1408752000,2,4106,4.798022598870056

851048,5,6304361238,"When a film opens up with a raspy-voiced Lon Chaney, Jr. ardently singing the title song, it almost comes with a guarantee of a weird trip ahead. Spider Baby (1964) does not disappoint.

Some commentators have likened Spider Baby to Eraserhead (1977), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974 ), or TVs the Addams Family, while others have erroneously categorized it as surreal. If we have to give comparisons, we might find it to be the most idiosyncratic film in the Old Dark House genre (and yes, that includes Rocky Horror Picture Show). Still, even that is not adequate. Spider Baby is a maverick that defies all labels.

Writer/director Jack Hills credits include Boris Karloffs unfortunate Z-grade Mexican horror films House of Evil (1968), Fear Chamber (1968), Isle of the Snake People (1971), Alien Terror (1971); the women-in-prison jigglefests The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972); the Pam Grier blaxploitation vehicle Foxy Brown (1974); and Switchblade Sisters (1975-the title says it all). All of these are lucid examples of trash cinema; Spider Baby is a one-of-a-kind inbred sibling to the lot.

The casting of  Lon Chaney, Jr. is, for once, near ideal. 1930s horror icons Karloff and Bela Lugosi each had an air of European mystery in their screen personas. 1940s horror second banana sort of horror icon Chaney, Jr was pure American white trash. When Universal tried to cast Chaney in the Karloff/Lugosi Euro mold, the results often ranged from laughable to cringe-inducing.

Chaney, Jr was, of course, unfavorably compared to his father and has received a lot of bad raps from critics past and present. Most of those raps are well deserved, but it was not his legendary father who proved to be the ultimate detriment to his career. It was Chaney Jr.s role as Lennie in Lewis Milestones Of Mice and Men (1939) that rendered an insurmountable yardstick performance. Chaney could never equal his Lennie, much in the same way that Lugosi could never live up to Dracula (1931).

Unfortunately, off-screen Chaney proved to be considerably more brutish than Steinbecks gentle giant, which helped seal his inevitable career failure. Other factors in his decline included alcoholism, drug abuse, typecasting, trying to live up to his fathers image, and (reportedly) self-loathing regarding his latent homosexuality.

Executives at Universal didn't help. After the success of Man Made Monster (1941) and The Wolf Man (1941) Universal cast Chaney Jr. as their new horror star. Somehow the studio was oblivious to Chaneys strengths and weaknesses. Astonishingly they cast the hulking, phlegmatic actor as a grand guignol romantic lead with a Clark Gable-like mustache in the Inner Sanctum films. Son of Dracula (1943) was an even worse case of miscasting with Chaney as the Transylvanian count who must have been living off an excessively high-calorie blood intake.

Few of Chaneys 200 plus films are of merit, but he did have a handful of good character parts in films which knew how to use him. Spider Baby is among those, featuring his last performance of note. Chaney liked the script so much that he made an extra effort to lay off the sauce, much to Hills relief.

There is a touch of pathos in Chaneys performance as the caretaker. He is close to Tod Browning territory here, seeing this misfit ensemble not as inbred cannibal freaks, but as family. Spider Baby is a far better way to remember Chaney than his actual last performances: Al Adamsons equally trashy but dreadful 1971 duo Female Bunch and Dracula vs. Frankenstein (both of which try hard to make Ed Wood look sophisticated).

Chaney is helped tremendously by his co-stars, which include Sid Haig as a bald, deformed version of Carroll Bakkers thumb-sucking Baby Doll (1956), Carol Ohmart as a well-worn, Z-grade Marilyn Monroe bitch of an aunt, and Jill Banner and Beverly Washburn as psychotic sisters.

The Merrye family is dying out, due to inbreeding and a rotting of the brain. Bruno (Chaney) is the family chauffeur who acts as their guardian. While Bruno is taking Ralph (Haig, perfectly embodying his character) to the doctor, Elizabeth (Washburn) plays itsy-bitsy spider with the mailman (veteran African American character actor Mantan Moreland). Ralph crawls out of the limo like a serpentine chihuahua. Torment floods Brunos eyes upon seeing what is left of the unfortunate courier. Virginia (Banner), doing her best Baby Jane Hudson imitation, cannot wait to tell. Its not nice to hate, Bruno reminds the family, but it turns out this was simply a case of killing the bad news messenger; the message being news that heir aunt Aunt Emily (Ohmart) will be arriving this very day to throw out the lot of them. Emily brings with her the goofy but amiable protagonist Peter (Quinn Redeker). There is even a slimy caricature of a lawyer who might pass for a cross between Adolf Hitler and John Waters father.

The Merrye house has a personality all its own, complete with rickety, ominous elevator shafts and a basement of dreaded family secrets. Alfred Taylors cinematography is an enormous asset, nearly masking the films meager budget. A perverted veggie Last Supper and a don't you dare do go there consummation (which is, thankfully, subdued) are scenes that burn themselves into the memory.

Hill, for once not working on commission, conceived  his child as a labor of love, and his attitude infected cast and crew. As bizarre as the script and direction is, it is an inspired cast that sells it. Dismemberment, incest, cannibalism and the budding sexuality of serial killers are all carried out with inexplicable charm. Still, even with fine work by all, it is Chaney who is the twinkle in the eye of the films hurricane.

This copy is really nice in picture and sound, especially considering it was a LOW budget affair.  The story is not bad for a ""horror"" comedy.  The acting is good and there is no real ""gore"", just implied.  I give it 5 stars for the quality of the DVD.

851051,4,6304361238,"Jack Hill might be king of the ""B"" film makers, but he's left a large thumb print on the industry with titles such as ""Foxy Brown"" and the ""Big Bird Cage."" ""Spider Baby"" might be his best effort.

Here's the scoop. The Merrye family has spawned some seriously demented offspring through incest. Even though growing toward adulthood, their minds will regress into infancy with disturbing results. A dedicated servant, Lon Chaney Jr., has vowed to keep them safe and sheltered in their 'off the road', run down mansion. Some long lost relatives show up with their lawyer in an attempt to ransack the estate. Boy, are they in for a surprise.

This is a creepy movie. The two sisters, one who has a thing for spiders, combine a mixture of innocence and evil that is unsettling. Sid Haig, as the really demented, creepy looking brother, set my skin to crawling. Lon Chaney gives a genuinely touching performance. He has been with the family forever and really cares for the well being of these kids, but the outside world is intruding and he knows he can't keep this up for long. The invading sister and brother family members are something themselves. Their lawyer is a squirrely little hump who is humorous in his squirreliness. The sister thinks way too much of herself and way too little of her brother who wants to get in the lawyer's secretary's knickers. They have no idea what they've walked into. The sets are good. One, in particular, has a dreamy/nightmarish quality. When demented sister Elizabeth is in there playing her ""spider"" game with the postal clerk, it's truly unsettling.

This is just a cool movie. It's modestly budgeted but it doesn't look cheap. Nice framing of shots and a deep focus give it a more professional sheen. The acting is good enough to help things move along. There aren't a lot of flicks out there like this one.

Spider Baby has a fairly simple premise--an ill family living in the wilds of California in a big creepy house with a terrible secret.  You'll find out what this secret is in the first 5 minutes, although you won't fully understand it right away.  I won't say much as far as the storyline goes, because anything you say about this movie will spoil it for the first time viewers.  What I will say is this film is loaded with unconventional ideas.  The entire story from start to finish is weird while at the same time being believable.  The timeline of the film is rather interesting, too.  It basically takes place all in one day, so what you are seeing is a very extraordinary day in the life of an extraordinary family.

I'll say a little about this family.  It is run by the butler, Bruno, a caring old man who watches over his 3 wards--children afflicted with a rare hereditary disease that causes the mind to degenerate.  Bruno has decided the best thing for the children is isolation because he fears the outside world's response to these unique kids.  So the family lives happily by themselves, the girls entertaining themselves with games they make up, and the boy with hunting cats around the property (bare-handed, mind you!).  The movie begins with intrusion--the families long lost aunt and uncle show up to take control of the estate.  And so this is where the trouble begins.

The movie will move forward from this point, more of the families history and disorders are revealed (you've just seen the beginning), and you'll even get a tour of the spooky old house.  There will also be a number of humorous moments as well.  Two that stand out are the dinner and the dancing scene where the aunt puts on a little show in her underwear for the viewing audience.

The girls are quite a handful, too.  Bruno does his best to keep them from misbehaving, but they are mischievous and tend to get themselves into trouble.  They are all smiles and polite words, curtsying uncontrollably to their guests.  Behind this faade are sinister plans of murder and mayhem.  It's not necessarily their fault, the disease leaves its victims somewhat morally impaired.  Indeed, they don't see their actions as anything but helpful.

The story will reach a climax when the two girls take matters into their own hands, and devise a plan to deal with their unwanted guests, and Bruno decides on the next plan of action for the family.  You'll have to trust me when I say it's pretty cool, and a number of the scenes at the end will stand out.

Spider Baby is a diamond of a movie.  Not a typical gore fest, nor any creature of supernatural abilities will be seen here.  But the movie is filled with eerie scenery and background, the script is tight, the acting believable, and the twists and turns many.  If you are a fan of the type of horror that blends elements of Val Lewton with William Castle, you'll like this one!",1292976000,,2924,4.5926640926640925
851100,5,6304361238,"I found 'Spider Baby' to be creepy yet funny little movie. Writer/director Jack Hill deserves mucho kudos for assembling a marvelous cast and putting together an absorbing little movie on what appears to be a very tight budget. The two young sisters in the film were both adorable and outstanding. And the sight of a very young Sid Haig bopping in and out of scenes were priceless. How this guy was overlooked at Oscar time is beyond me. The cinematographer, Alfred Taylor did a wonderful job 'spooking' up the mansion and the sets were incredible.
And also it was great to see the terrific Lon Chaney Jr. in his best work since the 'Wolfman'. His performance was poignant and nearly brought tears to my eyes at the tragic ending. As i mentioned at the begining, all the supporting roles were filled with skill and nuance. I would recommend this film to anyone who shares my love of B 'Horror' films. And the included documentary on the making of the film was alsoquite enjoyable. Add that to the 84 minutes of genius preceding it and you've got some great entertainment for a rainy Saturday afternoon.

I have seen several prints of this movie in different formats and this one looks the best. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film there is a terrible buzzing sound on the audio track. It comes and goes throughout the entire second half of the film, and is very noticeable and highly annoying. This is obviously a defect on the disk.

It is dark and morbid, funny and spoofish, crazy and insane - and it ALL works well into a GOOD and thought out story!...I have watched it at least 20 times since I bought this about a year (?) ago, and still have never tired of it!",1271030400,,579,3.9152542372881354
851103,5,6304361238,"Another Jack Hill classic. Maybe THE Jack Hill Classic. I cant praise this film enough. I love it.

The opening title sequence (featuring a creepy song sung by Lon Chaney) perfectly sets the tone: a live-action cartoon, somewhat akin to the Addams Family, but closer to the Texas Chainsaw Masacre in plot (but without a drop of blood). Scary, funny and suprisingly touching, this film deserves to be seen by as wider audience (although it enjoys great success as a Cult Classic). This is the film that gave Sid Haig his start in feature films, and he speaks nary a line of dialog!

If you have any interest at all in cult cinema of the 50's, 60's, and 70's, you really shouldnt let this one pass you by. I rank it up there with another black and white live-action cartoon from the same period: Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat! Kill, Kill! in terms of cult film enjoyability. But while Faster Pussycat is more overtly sexual/violent in tone, overall, this is a pretty much PG rated affair by today's standards (although I guess Faster Pussycat could probably get a PG today too). If viewed with Mom and Dad, this would be a great Halloween movie for the lil guys. No swearing or nudity and I'm guessing that kids would absolutely adore the dog-like character Ralph, played by Sid Haig and the Grandfatherly Bruno, played by Lon Chaney.

The DVD itself is a great package: great special features and a nice, clean, widescreen print. But don't let the misleading DVD cover fool you, there is absolutely no gore to be seen here (which I actually think adds to the film rather than detracts from it).",1269302400,2,1592,4.638297872340425
851104,5,6304361238,"If Lon Chaney, Jr. (born Creighton Tull Chaney in 1906, died 1973) ever pulled off a finer performance I don't know where or when. Usually he's a little too much the brooding victim who morphs into the Werewolf for me:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Meets-the-Wolf-Man-House-of-Frankenstein/dp/B00005LC4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man / House of Frankenstein</a>. But here, (somewhat as he was in his renowned Werewolf films), he's portrayed as a good guy... sort of.

This is an independent film which was shot over a seven-day period during the late summer of 1964. The location for shooting the home exteriors was the Smith Estate of Los Angeles, California -- this cool old house is still standing.

Chaney plays the servant-chauffer (the kindly old ""Bruno"") of the long-dead patriarch of a genetically-challenged family -- he's determined to carry out his old patron's wish to keep these demented children safe and insulated from society. There are three post-adolescent ""children,"" two girls and a boy, and as a result of their DNA shortcomings they are really into cannibalism, spiders, and maintaining their unique existence in the spooky old rural family mansion.

Everything is going along just fine for this clan of reprobates and their altruistic mentor until a really sleazy lawyer (!!!) and noxious family members show up to institutionalize the kids, thereby dispensing with the need for Bruno, and to legally steal the estate. This idea turns out to be an egregious error on the part of these greedy people as they spend the night in this creepy house of multiple horrors.

I must also add that the opening scenes featuring the great Mantan Moreland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-in-The-Jade-Mask/dp/B00020X86G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan in The Jade Mask</a>) riding his cool pseudo-motor scooter to the old mansion is a genuine hoot.

For me, this terrific black-and-white horror film has it all: great story, savory predictability (the greedy ones get their due), spooky old house, just enough subtle humor to make the film endearing to the viewer, superb camera work, flawless casting... on and on. It's a little offbeat and clearly a cult classic.

This film has also been known as: Attack of the Liver Eaters; Cannibal Orgy, or the Maddest Story Ever Told; Jack Hill's Spider Baby (Australia), and; The Liver Eaters.

851177,3,6304361238,"Spider Baby (Jack Hill, 1964)

Jack Hill and his old pal Sid Haig (Haig, as an actor, and Hill, as a director/writer, both got their respective starts in Hill's The Host) reunite for yet another incredibly silly film, this one involving an inbred family whose children grow normally until they reach the age of ten, at which time they begin a slow descent into psychotic cannibalism. The last three surviving children of the clan, Virginia (Jill Banner), Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn), and Ralph (Haig), are watched over by their late father's longtime chauffeur, Bruno (Lon Chaney Jr.). Everything's going along swimmingly, with the exception of the occasional deliveryman (Mantan Moreland, long known as Birmingham Brown in the Charlie Chan flicks) getting offed by Elizabeth, until the last surviving relatives and their lawyer descend on the house to try and get the girls into school (and claim the family inheritance, naturally). They insist on spending the night in the house. Mayhem ensues.

Now, Spider Baby is not deathless cinema by any standards, but that said, it's an absolute joy to watch. Sid Haig is almost hypnotic. The two girls play the mixture of nubile innocence and murderous rage with a surprisingly nuanced air for such a basement-budget flick. The characters are, for the most part, well-rounded, and there's enough variety in them that they don't resemble a walking buffet, as the camp counselors in so many slasher films do, for example. It's kind of a revelation to find out that even bad horror comedies from the sixties are better-written and more fun than most modern not-scary horror flicks. (Also: how weird is it that so many people involved with this movie died in 1973? THE CURSE OF SPIDER BABY!) Looking forward to the remake, which will most likely be as disappointing as ""remake"" implies, but I still have some hope.  ***",1202774400,,1860,5.0129449838187705

is his masterpiece.  I won't delve into the plot - as many other

to be seen to be believed. It gets the horror-comedy hybrid so many
other films of that era failed at just right. The sadly ailing alco-
holic Lon Chaney Jr. manages to use his condition at that time to a
marvelous sympathetic advantage. It's surely one of his best latter-
day performances.  Genre stalwarts Carol Ohmart (sexy) and Sid Haig
(hilarious) also stand out in fun character turns. And how can anyone
resist that howl-inducing opening shot of Mantan Moreland (in one of
his final screen roles) riding his messenger bike Marlon Brando-Wild
One style?  Of course, the real deal here is pretty young thing (and
former Brando mistress) the late Jill Banner as - what is presumably -
the title character.  This is a highly charged performance that fore-
shadows Christina Ricci's Wednesday Addams, and deserves to be just
as iconic. In a nut-shell, if you haven't caught Spider Baby's act

851180,5,6304361238,"Well, I finally watched the infamous Spider Baby, and it definitely lived up to the hype. It is actually one of the most entertaining 60's movie's I've ever seen, and is a classic directional debut from director Jack Hill.

It's about a demented, inbred, cannibalistic family with Virginia, a little girl that like's to pay ""spider"" and slice people up with knive's, the other little girl Elizabeth hate's everything and everybody (I know how that is), and constantly has to be reminded by the member's of the family ""not to hate"". Then you have Ralph (Sid Haig from Rob Zombie's movie's) the most mentally deficiant and weirdest of the bunch who like's to hunt cat's and spy on naked ladie's. Last but not least you have the loveable Bruno (Lon Chaney Jr.) playing the caretaker of the house and gaurdian of the family, who is constantly trying to keep the peace, and most importantly keep the chidren from violently murdering and eating the house guest's.

Spider Baby is an above average 60's horror flick with decent acting for the time, competent direction, it really pushes the envelope for the time it was made. Director Jack Hill does a great job telling the story through all the character's dioluge and backround information. Not many movie's can pull off the extremely weird element while actually telling a story and staying entertaining for the whole film. It's a very influential movie that I think helped inspire numerous ""crazy family"" movie's, most notably the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Dark Sky film's finally gave this cult-classic the release it deserve's with an anamorphice widescreen transfer, full length feature commentary by director Jack Hill and Sid Haig, a couple of featurettes, an extended scene, and an alternate opening sequence. Highly recommended.

Lon Chaney, Jr. is magnificent as the long suffering butler of the family, who has a degenerative disease (called Merrye Syndrome, a sort of early dementia).  After it was released (sort of) in 1964, it went into limbo over rights and issues like that, and was released under several names, like Cannibal Orgy: Or The Maddest Story Ever Told and The Liver Eaters.  After a few unsuccessful releases under this myriad of titles, it disappeared and many people thought it was lost.

851184,5,6304361238,"Before I begin let me say that Spider Baby is one of my 4 favorite films of all time.  Jack Hill's comments are worth the price of the film alone to anyone who appreciates the struggles and gambles of low budget film making at the start of their career.  This is only part of the extras, but let's sharpen our knives and go bug hunting with the movie itself.

Jack Hill's horror, cult classic tells the tale of the last of the Merrye family who suffer from a degenerative disease of the brain that begins at about 10 years of age due to inbreeding.  The Merrye children could be said to be homicidal, cannibalistic, pyschotic and yet at times show childlike innocence and charm.  Their two aunts (that have proceeded them into total madness)live (if you can call it that) in the basement.  The Merrye family is cared for by their devoted caregiver and chauffeur, Bruno who has made a deathbed promise to the children's father to always protect and look after the children.

Enter into the story an Aunt wanting to take over the family holdings, her nieve brother, her sleezy lawyer and the lawyer's beautiful, playful, and easily unnerved, legal assistant.

While Spider Baby is a low budget survivor of lawsuits, drive-ins and hidden copies; it has endured the test of time due to the acting talents of the cast.  Lon Chaney Jr. (Bruno) could count this as one of his last films and Jill Banner (Virginia aka Spider Baby) as her first movie role.  Sid Haig (Ralph) is an art form unto himself with his contortions and facial expressions.  Beverly Washburn (Elizabeth) is so compelling with her rollercoater worth of moods.  Carol Ohmart (Aunt Emily Howe) is both sexual and evil in her selfish motives.  Her brother Quinn K Redeker (Uncle Peter Howe) is both narrator and out to lunch friend to all.  Mary Mitchel (Ann) is pure comedy relief, perfect victim and mirror to any scene she is in.  Mantan Moreland (the messenger) brought a politically incorrect, African-American role to the beginning of the film which has to be appreciated for a comedy style that had faded from movies by 1964.  The last character I would like to mention is the house and grounds themselves which have horror, comedy and degeneration that so describes the entire movie.  The house and grounds are in a sense the spider web.

Overall, the roles are wonderfully defined, the story is told well, the violence is off camera yet clear. The strength of the acting lies in the non-verbal facial, use of hands and motion.

There are really two endings in the same movie.  The first is both twisted and logical in it's climax.  The second is a surprise and leaves one wishing for a sequel that never happened.

This film is so delicious and sickening in the same bite. Spider Baby will make you laugh and scream in the same breath.

851231,3,6304361238,"Directed by Jack Hill before I was born, this B&W favorite of the drive-in set was seen thanks to the insistence of a fellow movie buff.

Lon Chaney Jr. stars as a loveable father figure to three young children suffering from a condition known as Merrye Syndrome.  As read to us from ""The Dictionary of Rare and Peculiar Diseases"" (and since it came from a book it must be true), this debilitating disease causes age regression starting at age 10 and progresses throughout the victim's lifetime thanks to years of inbreeding.  It's delivered straight and serious, but it's obviously a tongue-in-cheek excuse for the kids to deliver some murder and malice without much thought of consequence.  Plenty of opportunities are given thanks to the appearance of a heartless distant relative and a sleazy lawyer who wish to separate the family.

If you're a fan of the movie, you be happy with the quality transfer of a film this old.  In addition to some informative director commentary and footage from the 30-year cast reunion, you'll also get a few extra minutes of rightly deleted footage of some back-and-forth between Lon Chaney and the lawyer before they arrive at the Merrye Estate.  I immediately recognized my old stomping grounds in Calabasas and I thought for sure they were filming at Norman Bates' house (I was wrong.)  Look for the unintentional reflection of the camera and assistant director from the car window at the beginning as well as a quick cutaway of the two girls in the finale, where they appear to be laughing at all the chaos.

I own a lot of reference books about cult movies, too, and many times they will tip you off to something worth searching out. So, it's practically impossible to find a treasure cold. In other words, it's almost impossible to be able to watch a good movie without any preconceived notions about the movie that you are about to watch, or knowing what the plot is basically about before you actually view the movie, and watching a movie without knowing anything about it is the ideal way to watch a movie.

I was browsing at the video store when I came across the movie Spider Baby. I had never heard of it before. I read the box and decided to take a chance on it. I watched the movie from beginning to end. I was so blown away, that I immediately watched the movie from beginning to end again, something that I have only done a handful of times in my life. It was the kind of experience that cult movie collectors cherish, finding an incredible masterwork and viewing it cold.

Spider Baby is a black and white film written and directed by Jack Hill in 1963. I'll tell you about the movie here, but I could never do the movie justice. This is the kind of movie that, if you have any interest in cult movies at all, you should search out and watch for yourself. It has my highest recommendation. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, and always find something new to marvel at with each viewing. It's a darkly black comedy which is loopy, stupid, funny, creepy, outrageous, and shocking and it's not like anything you've ever seen before. The closest thing I can think of to compare it to is maybe an episode of The Addams Family gone horribly awry.

Here is a synopsis of the plot, such as it is: An unfortunate family, surnamed Merrye, are all inflicted by a disease called Merrye Syndrome, being as the syndrome has only affected the lineage of the Merrye family. The syndrome strikes as a progressive deterioration of the mental faculties, starting in childhood, and progressing until the afflicted Merrye becomes a complete idiot. Somehow, the deceased patriarch of the family, Titus Merrye, had acquired a decent amount of money, and hired a chauffeur, played by Lon Chaney, Jr. Before his death, Mr. Merrye made the chauffeur promise to take care of his offspring, two daughters and a son, and make sure that they are never held up to public ridicule. So Lon becomes the custodian of the children. His main goal is to just keep the children in the house, away from the public's eye. The son, played by the wonderful Sig Haig, is a bald headed man-child idiot who looks like something out of Tod Browning's Freaks. Since he is the oldest, he is the one whose mind has deteriorated the most. The two daughters seem to be around 17 or 18, but they act much younger. One of the daughters, Virginia, likes to play ""spider"" and trap the rare visitor who comes to the house and slice the victim up, or ""sting"" the victim with two large knifes. This upsets the caretaker, Lon Chaney, because he has to dispose of the bodies, and these incidents could trigger the curiosity of the world outside. Also, Uncle Ned and Aunt Martha, who are way gone mentally, are kept in a pit in the basement.

Two distant relatives of the Merrye family, an Uncle and Aunt, show up one day with a lawyer and his secretary. The Merrye estate is worth some money, so the Aunt wants to put the kids in a facility for retarded persons and divide up the proceeds of the estate. Lon had promised the father of the children to never let anything like this happen, so he is quite distressed by this development. He invites the visitors into the run-down mansion and hopes the situation will work itself out, but bad things start to happen. The children realize that these people are going to disturb their way of life, and take matters into their own hands on the first evening of their visit. Lon Chaney has no control over the horrible events that are taking place and he realizes that there is no way to cover up these unfortunate incidences. Other people will come and put an end to their lifestyle for good. Since Lon made a promise to the elder Merrye that he would never allow this to happen, he must now take drastic measures. In a very moving, emotional scene, Lon tells the children that he has a way of making everything better and that he can solve all of their problems once and for all. The children trust him enough to go along with whatever he thinks is best, and Lon does solve their problems once and for all.

I was being purposely vague in the plot synopsis. I want you to be able to watch it like I did, without knowing what is going to happen next. I don't want to ruin the viewing experience for you. True to all of the Jack Hill movies that I have seen, there's at least one jaw dropping scene. In this case, it's a scene in which Virginia, the daughter who likes to ""play spider,"" ties up her Uncle Peter. As I said earlier, after years of watching cult movies, it's rare for something to have that effect on you, but it did and does.

The acting in the movie is superb. Sid Haig, Lon Chaney, and the two actresses playing the daughters are all incredible. This is some kind of masterwork, and is a desert island movie, so I'm giving it a rating of 6. Find it and watch it.

851234,3,6304361238,"This horror camp comedy has slowly earned its cult status over the four decades since its release. It is aka: THE MADDEST STORY EVER TOLD, THE LIVER EATERS, and CANNIBAL ORGY. Jack Hill wrote, directed and edited it. He filmed it in 12 days. He was a former production assistant for Roger Corman, and he learned how to keep America's Drive In screens busy. Over his career, he directed 21 films, and most of them had their debuts over the shiny hoods of automobiles, flickering madly, competing for teenager's attention span. His later films included COFFY and SWITCHBLADE SISTERS.

The film opened using comic credits, with Lon Chaney Jr., the film's one major star, singing the title song. The song was later released on 45, the flip side of Bobby Pickett's MONSTER HOLIDAY. This movie, although not a serious candidate to compete for horror status when rubbing shoulders with the AI Edgar Allen Poe classic, mostly starring Vincent Price, or with the British Hammer lush color gore fests that were the remakes of all the old American Universal classics. But never the less, it has managed to carve out its own quiet niche. It never takes itself too seriously, and yet never reduces itself to burlesque and pratfalls like the TV shows THE ADAMS FAMILY, and THE MUNSTERS that were popular at the time. It became a crude schematic for future films done about a ""crazy family""; films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS.

Bad movies are a genre unto themselves. This movie shared something significant with several Ed Wood features. Wood gave the aging Bela Lugosi some screen time before his death. In this film, Jack Hill gave the aging Lon Chaney Jr., who actually had starred with Lugosi in several Universal 40's horror classics, his farewell role. Chaney, who was an alcoholic, stayed dry for the two weeks of the shoot. Despite everything, he managed to deliver a rather nuanced and poignant performance; implying that he never really was given much of a chance to show what he could do as a dramatic actor. I remember him as Big Sam in THE DEFIANT ONES. He showed some dramatic promise in that one.

The plot centered around a fictitious medical problem, a genetic brain malady called the ""Merrye Syndrome"". Just before puberty, at about age ten, the family members would begin to regress their emotional age. At some point they would lose language, and develop a taste for human flesh. Several of the older family members were kept in a pit in the basement, where the odd dead body was tossed as a delicacy. Chaney as Bruno, the family chauffer, was the guardian of the last three children, and the family secret.

The old comedy veteran, Mantan Moreland, had a brief scene as a Messenger. He was dispatched early, and fed to the family in the basement. The plot thickened with the arrival of two cousins, their lawyer, and his secretary; more fodder for the fiends. I did like the dinner scene, where the strangers were fed roast cat, dry grass salad, boiled fungus, and bug stew. Carol Ohmart played cousin Emily, and she was able to do a gratuitous strip tease scene, and then parade around in black lingerie for a time.

In 1964, I thought this movie was silly, and not very scary. Today, upon reflection, I see it as prototypical in its creativity, that it had some clever writing, was fairly dark and humorous, and there was above average acting in it.",1098403200,8,3392,4.742372881355932

Well, take THE ADDAMS FAMILY (both the TV series and the movies), add THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS, toss in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, blend in a tablespoon of the attitude of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, with just a pinch of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and stir violently. That comes about as close as I can get to describing it. Jack Hill has created a macabre masterpiece, full of frights and fun from beginning to end! The Merrye family have ""Merrye Syndrome"", a rotting of the brain, caused by generations of inbreeding. The kids- Virginia (Jill Banner), Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn), and Ralph (Sid Haig) are real cut-ups! They've been isolated in a big, secluded house on a hill, watched over by Bruno (Lon Chaney Jr.) for their entire lives. Now teenagers, things are about to change. A pair of distant relatives (played by Quinn Redeker and Carol Ohmart) have come, with sleazy lawyer in tow, to take control and institutionalize the children. Unfortunately for these invaders, they don't know just how crazy the kids really are. They are also ignorant of the fact that these siblings are cannibals! If they had known, they would never have spent the night!

851237,4,6304361238,"Also known as THE LIVER EATERS, and subtitled THE MADDEST STORY EVER TOLD (a variation on the DeMille movie); this 30th Anniversary DVD of Jack (FOXY BROWN) Hill's horror classic SPIDER BABY is a real treat. For a movie addict like myself, discovering this is like having Xmas come early.
Hill's script deals with an imaginary medical condition known as ""Merrye's Syndrome"", a ""rotting of the brain"" a disease so awful many authorities are in denial of its existance. The result of inbreeding, the sufferer experiences age regression, which is to say as the body grows, the mind gets younger. SPIDER BABY tells the story of ""that fateful day ten years ago"" that Merrye's Syndrome was wiped out forever.
Despite their name, the Merrye family are anything but and make the Addams family look like the Cleavers by comparison.
Horror legend Lon Chaney Jr has one of his best roles as Bruno Schlocker, the Merrye family's new chauffeur- though unknown to him the previous driver was ""webbed"" by Virginia Merrye (Jill Banner), one of their cute but deranged daughters. As if that wasn't enough the poor chap also had his ears hacked off with a pair of carving knives. What a lovely young lady. The other psychotic daughter is Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn) also cute, but suffering from radical brain rot. And last but not least is Ralph (Sid Haig) an unfortunate fellow who stalks and kills domestic cats, which the Merryes then roast and serve to their guests; who are told they're eating rabbit. Ironically, the Merrye family are all vegans because.... nope. No spoilers.
During dinner one of the guests asks Bruno: ""Isn't Ralph a vegetarian too?"" to which Bruno replies: ""Yes, but Ralph's allowed to eat anything that he catches"".
DVD extras include Commentary by Jack Hill: which is actually worth listening to (Unlike some bloated commentaries by Hollywood egoists and talentless film makers); filmographies for Hill and Lon Chaney Jr; plus footage of the 30th Anniversary reunion presented by archivist Johnny Legend as well as an additional 8 minutes of previously unseen footage.
A must have for cult movie buffs; SPIDER BABY is a true original and four decades on it retains its creepy fascination. Buy it and let the SPIDER BABY weave its macabre web on you!!",1055548800,22,2262,4.939632545931759

The cast is really good, especially Sid Haig.  This movie is an obvious precursor to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which should make people want to see it.  Besides it has Lon Chaney Jr. in it.

If you like the bizarre with a comic twist, this is your film. No real blood and gore here, just a neat little movie with a black and white, Sixties TV show kind of look. This movie was way ahead of its time, with an Addams Family feel to it. In fact, from watching the Addams Family on TV and enjoying the Charles Addams cartoons, I always had the feeling that this creepy stuff was really what they were doing just off camera or in their cartoon basement.
The camera work, direction, and most of the acting are excellent. Also, the added features, the 30th cast reunion and newly-discovered eight minutes (an interesting curio that really doesn't add to or take away from anything in the theatrical cut) adds to the overall package.
My only complaint is the sound level seems to drop in a few places in the movie, but considering how rare this film is, that is a very minor observation. I don't mind hitting the volume control a couple of times to get to enjoy this gem over and over.

851273,5,6304361238,"In the past, I have always approached Jack Hill's movies with a little bit of excitement, a little bit of curiousity, and a little bit of trepidation, as I do with any cult movie.  Let's face it, cult is a genre which is truly hit or miss - some of the movies are amazing, and others are, well, downright horrible.
As always, Jack Hill delivers.  'Foxy Brown' was above expectations.  'Switchblade Sisters' truly blew me away.  And 'Spider Baby...' I could have never expected what I ended up with.  This movie was awesome!  The directing is top-notch.  The shots, the camera work, the acting are all exactly as they should be in a piece of this genre (the horror/bizarre thriller type).  The story, too, is a wonderful one, and the writing adds all the necessary touches to make this a great piece of work.  There are many cult-classics out there that have earned their place because of their incessant weirdness, their ultra low-budget feel, or their niche appeal.  'Spider Baby' has earned its place because it is, quite simply, a damn good movie - well-made, well-written, interesting, and unique.  All the people I have showed this film to loved it, whether they were cult fans or not.  I would recommend this movie to absolutely everyone.

He tries to protect his wards from their own psychotic tendencies, and from the grasping relatives who try to make a profit from the children's tragic dementia, but ultimately it proves too much for him.

The print on this Image Entertainment DVD is quite good, and there are some interesting extras. The memorable ""X-Files"" episode featuring the extremely grotesque hillbilly family suffering from all kinds of in-breeding problems owes a lot to this movie, as does the film ""Deliverance"", whose strange, scary, and bald banjo-playing weirdo is almost an exact duplicate of the ""Ralph"" character here.

851278,5,6304361238,"Some movies hit the nail squarely on the head.  Usually, those nails are same ones that have been beaten to death by every other  film - the nails are the usual ones, and nobody is very surprised when you take a lick with a hammer and hit it.
Some movies aim for different nails, in different walls.  If they glancingly hit, we say that the film ""broke new ground"".  But sometimes, the aim is perfect, devestating, direct and complete.  It is impossible to imagine a more perfect, yet unexpected expression of that particular point.  One can only admire.

SPIDER BABY is such a film.  It is a great film.  The odd, uncertain tone of Shirley Jackson's underrated novel ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" is nailed here as well as it is EVER going to be done, as well as it Can Be Done in the movies, probably.  It contains Lon Chaney Jr's best performance, which is enough reason to buy it right there.  But Spider Baby's charms don't end there.  They are valuable and varied, though nearly impossible to put into words.  You either 'get it' or you don't.
This is one of those few, perfect films which should enter the pantheon.  It is a classic which deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with Tod Browning's ""Freaks"".
A few treasured moments:  Carol Ohmart's negligee scene which goes on-and-on-and-on.  and on, and on.  The ""Step-Scrape, Step Scrape"" line at the dinner table, while discussing The Mummy movies (as a pained but indulgent Lon Chaney looks on helplessly), and the marvelous throw-away line ""get me something Sharp!"" as the girls explore the house in the dead of night.

851279,5,6304361238,"I had read about this film for years and never really bothered to track down a copy. I hate to say it now, but based on some of Jack Hill's other work (e.g. Blood Bath) I was expecting something more along the lines of, say, House of the Black Death, or an Al Adamson movie. Nothing could be further from the truth; all the praise heaped on it below is totally accurate. The story/screenplay is fresh, funny, and completely bizarre, evoking earlier AND later movies/TV shows like Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Addams Family, but really very unlike any of them. The cast is uniformly terrific (unlike most low-budget schlock of this era); it's actually hard to single out anyone, although Lon Chaney, icy/hot Carol Ohmart, Quinn Redeker, and Jill Banner (in her first acting role) are especially impressive. And if you (like myself) have reservations about most ""horror comedies,"" relax: this isn't the broad, dated, farcical humor of, for example, roughly contemporary Roger Corman flicks; Spider Baby is played straight, with the humor (and the horror) allowed to arise from the situation, as in all the best comedy. You don't want to know any plot details, just buy this movie; having finally seen Spider Baby, it's leaped instantly into my top ten must-see list. This is one ""cult classic"" that really deserves its reputation.
The Image DVD does this film a long-delayed justice. The quality of the source print is fantastic, crisp and detailed, with very good contrast and tonal scale, and only the slightest traces of wear (some very minor speckling and a few blemished frames here and there). I agree with another reviewer that the rediscovered ""lost"" footage IS vital to the movie and should be reincorporated into any future reissue. The audio commentary by Jack Hill, while a little more laid back than, say, Tom Weaver on the Universal discs, is quite interesting and informative. I'm amused that he and several of the principals involved can't seem to understand why their film has such a fervent cult. And after hearing all the comments from Hill and the actors (in footage from the cast and crew reunion) about how much they all believed in the movie, it's heartbreaking to know that it immediately got sucked into litigation and sat essentially unreleased and  ""lost"" for so many years. I could go on and on, but all you need to know is: if you're any kind of cult, horror, exploitation movie freak, see Spider Baby!

Bruno also acts as caretaker and guardian of the Merrye children Elizabeth (Beverly Washburn), Ralph (Sid Haig), and the Spider Baby herself, Virginia (Jill Banner).  Bruno unconditionally loves the Merrye children, despite their beastly behavior, which is due to their genetic affliction.  Brunos speech to Elizabeth and Virginia about them being together forever is so moving, it could bring a tear to a glass eye.  Veteran character actor Mantan Moreland falls victim to Virginia in a game of Spider, while Peter Howe (Quinn Redeker) survives the game.  His sexy sister Emily Howe, played by the beautiful Carol Ohmart, succumbs to the animal charms of Ralph Merrye, with disastrous results.  The story ends with a bang, followed by an epilogue that hints at a future Spider Baby in the Howe family.  Sadly, no sequel has been forthcoming.
