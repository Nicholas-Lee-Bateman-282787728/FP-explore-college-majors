322918,3,6301229452,"I recommend this movie for fans of slow-paced 70s and 80s horror.  It relies not so much on sudden scares, but on creating a creepy and uncomfortable atmosphere, which some viewers may appreciate, but others may find boring.  The climax was a little bit of a letdown after the long setup, but where this movie shines is creating an uneasy feeling even while doing something as simple as having a quiet dinner.",1454803200,2,409,4.666666666666667

322921,2,6301229452,"I thought this witchcraft movie was very boring, most of these series I have seen  are pretty good but not this one. Of course I read the review from others before I bought it and should have taken heed to them. I wanted to see this first series because I had never seen it. The  only thing I got out of it was how Will Spanner came about. He is the main character in other witchcraft series. I would not had lost much by not seeing this film but I did get to see how it all started.",1354492800,,483,3.9183673469387754
322922,1,6301229452,"I bought this movie on DVD because I thought it looked interesting.  And because I am on a tight budget 97 cents seemed like a steal to me.  After I watched it I found out why it cost so little.  The story unfolds as two witches are burned at the stake over 9000 years ago.  And then fast forward 9000 years later and the witch couple comes back from hell and wants to eat your soul.  Yes 'im serious thats the whole plot.  That's all you're getting from this movie.  The warlock takes his wife and baby to his ""mothers"" house to wreak havoc amongst them and tortures his wife with bad visuals.  LOL.  No need to go on too much from here because the other reviews say it all.  And as for any splatter lets just say any fans of the slasher genre will be very disappointed.  The body count is low,almost everybody lives.  Not to mention a disappointment to 80's horror fans in general.  This movie is epic fail and I promise you will regret buying it.  I know I have,I watched the dvd as a time waster instead of an actual movie.  I don't think I will ever purchase Witchcraft 2.",1246320000,5,1077,4.21078431372549
322923,1,6301229452,"After enduring this ""classic"" I was overcome with the urge to flee, as if such future movie experiences were avoidable as a result of previous insufferable misjudgments.  This film was wowingly poor.  Not unimpressive, nor mediocre, but just POOR.  While I have a special place in my heart for most circa-1980's horror series part ones, this little piece of Hell scarred me with boredom.  So, here's why you should take this to heart and NOT EVER WATCH THIS...

When you think of a 1980's horror films what pops in your head first?  Gore?  Cheap scares provoked by sudden scene changes and loud sound effects?  Gratuitous nudity?  You'll find none of these things here.  Not only did this movie suffer a complete lack of even remotely eerie scenes, the producers didn't even have the common decency to force some fledgling actress bare her bosom, butt, or scantily clad body.  No kids are doing drugs or having premarital sex either--so, by common law of horror, no one deserves to die in this movie!  (And almost no one does.)

The greatest gore effect involves two robed figures hovering over what could only be described as roadkill in a birdbath.  The figures chant some incomprehensible syllables while kneading mashed organs in their hands and then, GASP, putting it in their mouths.  This scene made me tremble no more than when I eat a poorly prepared meatloaf.  The other effects, if we're elevating them to such a name, were limited to sketchy visions through a mirror that was probably meant to feel like a spooky oracle.

I suppose I could address the plot.  Scene One, some people are killed.  All the rest of the scenes, those people were somehow reincarnated into a mother and son (though lovers in scene one) who are obsessed with the son's new child.  Why?  Well, clearly that child is a reincarnation of their unborn child when they were burnt at the stake and, is the ""child of the devil"" as well.  Far from compelling.

So we have a lame plot festooned with poor attempts at effects, a total absence of scares, some unexplained motives, no nudity (for those of you who care), and an unsatisfying ending.  Though, to the ending's credit, it was no more disappointing than the rest of the movie.  In fact, for the first time during the movie I was happy when it ended.",1243900800,6,2286,4.697732997481109
322924,2,6301229452,"How do lousy movies like these get made? The guy who said all the actors were ""no-names,"" wasn't kidding. Witchcraft 2 isn't much better.
Maybe I'm just self-destructive. I like to watch awful movies just so I can complain about them later. Hey, if that's your thing, then by all means plunk your money down, but if it's not ... then I suggest you save it for a carton of milk.",1064016000,5,377,4.323943661971831

7810661,4,6301229452,"WITCHCRAFT (1988) opens w/ a man and a pregnant woman being burned at the stake by an angry mob, some centuries ago. This is inter-cut w/ modern day scenes of a woman named Grace Churchill (Anat Topol) having a baby. Let's just say it's a... difficult delivery. While the burning couple look increasingly like baked ziti, Grace sees visions of their toasty torment. Once the baby is born, her husband, John, convinces her to move in w/ his mother, Elizabeth (Mary Shelley), in her big, spooky house for ""a few days"". Not surprisingly, strange occurrences begin almost immediately, while Grace suffers from dizzy spells, blackouts, and terrible nightmares. She discovers that the house has a mysterious, unused section. She also meets Ellsworth (Lee Kissman), the mega-creepy butler! More things happen, indicating that black magic may be afoot! Especially, when a visiting priest has a very bad experience, and winds up resembling a sausage left too long in the microwave. What's really going on? What, if anything, does it have to do w/ that ""other"" part of the house? As time passes, the only normal person in Grace's life appears to be her friend, Linda (Deborah Scott). A growing sense of conspiratorial gloom settles over the house. Death and awfulness ensue. While certainly not another ROSEMARY'S BABY, WITCHCRAFT does have that 80's supernatural horror charm, and is better than many such straight-to-video offerings of the era! Ms. Topol is quite convincing in her role. The cheeeze-level runs from medium to semi-high. I love the sound effects during one dinner, when it sounds as though someone is crushing clam shells w/ pliers! Highly entertaining... EXTRA CREDIT: For Mary Shelley -Hmmm, that name sounds familiar. I wonder... - for her quietly malevolent performance... EXTRA-EXTRA CREDIT: For the satanic shock finale!...",1506816000,,1837,5.188552188552189
7810662,2,6301229452,"This movie has a lot of critics for being ""boring"" (and I'm certainly one of those critics), but there must be a market for this type of material, because this franchise has about a dozen sequels! The story presented here is very basic. It's hard to discuss without delving into spoilers... but essentially, the movie consists of a mother and her newborn baby living in an unfamiliar mansion. A subsection of the mansion has been abandoned (more or less), and so the mother's trips to this ""off-limits"" area are meant to be tense and spooky. Fans of this film will praise the importance of atmosphere over traditional scares and gore... but I didn't find the atmosphere all that creepy or intriguing. The ""off-limits"" area of the mansion (arguably the ""scariest"" location) is brightly lit. It's a little dusty and cluttered with furniture, but nothing too terribly uninviting. Also, the mother has continual visions of witchcraft and witch-burnings, but those too aren't particularly well done. I did enjoy the gross (yet wholly predictable) plot point involving a hapless priest. His visit to the evil mansion sends him into an immediate downward spiral of which there's no return. But other than that, this movie fell flat for me.",1502755200,,1232,4.985436893203883

If you cant take a movie with a bit of a plot, or, conversely,  need it to have like 200 million ""intellectual"" nuances (because what moron doesnt want a ""deep"" horror movie that ""makes you think""..yawn) don't bother watching it.  If you just want blood and guts, don't bother watching it.  If you don't like ""old"" or ""classic"" horror, don't bother watching it.  If you want a good old witch movie, more along the lines of black sunday, or other older 60s-70s witch movies, then give it a go.  It isn't gory like superstition, or even witchboard, even though it is from the 80s, but i found it entertaining, and, as stated, I loved it as a kid.",1497225600,,735,4.321167883211679
