2983516,3,B000WM84ZE,"TNA: Year One was a good dvd. I thought the wrestlers were humble and greatful that TNA worked out, which was nice to see. The problem was I thought the wrestlers were very dry and didn't come off as excited, more like dumbfounded. Even Don West was quite! It's amazing how many times you hear WCW in this documentary because ive always said TNA was just like WCW. Passionate TNA fans hate hearing it but this dvd proves it. I found it interesting that the year one ring was a former WCW ring. I also like how they omitted mentioning Vince Russo, who had a big part in Year One. Maybe he is poision. I was amazed at how many wrestlers came into TNA for year one. I don't really know how they made it past year one but then again I do, the X-division.  I love how Christopher Daniels said that the X-division was the main focus in the early years because in 2008, its non existent. The bonus matches were a joke because three of the four matches are on other TNA releases. They could have picked more matches out and I think it would have put this dvd over the top. Still a must have for TNA fans or people wanting to know about TNA. Cant wait for Year Two.",1201046400,,1156,4.183856502242152

TNA attempts to look back at their first year here though a documentary & bonus matches.

The documentary begins with Jeff Jarrett, Jeremy Borash, and backstage talent Bob Ryder discussing the end of WCW & still being paid via their contracts throughout the summer along with doing international tours learning the basis of running a wrestling promotion. How Jarrett getting sick on a fishing trip lead to talks about beginning TNA.  The reasoning behind doing a weekly PPV concept was discussed.  How the roster was assembled and talent got their jobs though a tryout show was talked about with Don West, Chris Harris, James Storm, and referee Rudy Charles discussing memories of that night.  All the problems that happened at the first TV taping revolving around a 450 lbs. ""cheeky"" wrestler breaking the ring ropes minutes before the live show started was heavily discussed along with the story of how Ron & Don Harris pulled off a miracle seconds before the show started.  Various talent discussed weather they thought the company would last with people like B.G. James being honest & saying they didn't think it would.  The story of how Dixie Carter & Panda Energy got involved with the financing dating back to how she used to live next door to Jarrett several years earlier.  Some of the internal changes that were made along with how money was so tight that Dixie herself was the makeup lady & helped paint the bleachers with spray paint.  How the concept of the X division was created right down to the reasoning behind the ""X"", memories of the 3 way ladder match, and how the X division wrestlers were having the spotlight put on them because of the quality of matches they produced was gone into great detail.  The concept of the tag team division & how it was based around America's Most Wanted was talked about next along how memories of the feuds with the New Church & Triple X.  The decision to move to the TNA Asylum and how much the smaller ""ECW-like"" crowd played into the growth of the company at that time is talked about next.  The debut of Raven and how much of an impact he had in the company by bring over ECW fans & being the first name to jump from WWE to TNA is talked about before moving on to his feud with Jeff Jarrett & how that match drew TNA's biggest turn away crowd at the time to the point where Don West had to park his car in an animal stall because there was no room.  Reflections on the first year by those involved & how that got them to where they are today round out the documentary.

Throughout the documentary, you'll get footage of memorable TNA moments from the first year such as the Jarrett/Toby Keith incident, Ken Shamrock winning the NWA Title at the first show, A.J. Styles & Jerry Lynn becoming the first NWA Tag Team Champions of the TNA era, Jarrett brawling with the Tennessee Titans, Ron ""The Truth"" Killings winning the NWA Title, AMW winning the tag titles for the first time, Jarrett's first NWA Title reign, Raven's debut, A.J. Styles winning his first NWA Title, and Roddy Piper's debut (they didn't show the shoot promo on Vince Russo.)

DVD bonus extras include the local commercial for TNA's first taping, highlights of the Chris Harris vs. James Storm tryout match, and various talent giving their memories of the late Curt Hennig.  Also included is a highlight package of those who made appearances during the first year of TNA from actors (Dustin ""Screech"" Diamond & Chris Rock), legends (Harley Race & Ricky Steamboat), names from the past (Vader & Hacksaw Jim Duggan), and various wrestlers (Sabu, Scott Hall, C.M. Punk) just to name a few.

Matches Include:
Ladder Match: X Division Champion Low-Ki vs. Jerry Lynn vs. A.J. Styles - For the record for the newer fans, Low-Ki was also known as Senshi in his later TNA years but currently known as Kaval (NXT Season 2 winner) in WWE. Low-Ki's style of stiff kicks played heavily early on including breaking a boston crab Lynn had on Styles by repeatily kicking him in the chest & later kicking A.J. repeatily while he was hanging upside down on the ladder. The ladder did come into play various times such as both A.J. & Lynn baseball slidekicking the ladder into each other, both hip tossed Low-Ki in the ladder setup in the corner, Lynn reversing a DDT into a suplex on A.J. into the ladder, Low-Ki reversing a Lynn running powerbomb into a frankensteiner into the ladder, A.J. hanging from the ladder while Ki kept kicking him & later applying a dragon sleeper onto A.J., and Lynn doing the cradle piledriver off the ladder onto Ki. For those longtime TNA fans, they know that this match is known as one of the most famous matches in TNA's history & deserves to be.

X Division Championship/Double Elimination Match: A.J. Styles vs. Low Ki vs Psicosis vs. Jerry Lynn - This was to determine the first ever X Division Champion in a gauntlet style match where two men would wrestle at a time with the winner of the fall facing the next opponent & keep going until every other competitor had been eliminated twice with the final man becoming the champion with Ricky Steamboat as the referee in the final fall.  This was a very fast paced match with each man being a different style into the match such as lucha libre & martial arts & submission while displaying unique offense such as a rana executed from their back, a dragon sleeper top rope DDT, and various moves either off or over the top rope with the final two men literally wrestling each other into exhaustion.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Raven - This was the most anticipated match in the first year of TNA to the point where they had to turn away many people from the Asylum & it should also be noted that the women in Raven's corner during this match is the woman now known as Mickie James in WWE. Both men got busted open in the opening minutes as this went from a normal wrestling into a brawl with tables being broken & both on the giving & receiving end of low-blows. Appearances from the ECW reunion faction of ""Extreme Revolution"", Sabu, and the S.E.X. stable just added to the wildness of this brawl. This was a wild match that had a mix of everything for everyone.

Overall, if your expecting a WWE like presentation then you won't find it here as this documentary took more of the format that ""Forever Hardcore"" did where it heavily relies more on their shoot interviews & photos to get their points across instead of using archival footage...that TNA actually owns in this case.  One big negative is that certain things were left out such as Jerry Jarrett's involvement in the company past the occasional ""my old man"" line from Jarrett and the importance of the NWA's name involved with the product (it was their title belts being used for 5 years).  Besides that, I give TNA an A for effort as they did their job in introducing an audience to TNA's history who wasn't around for that first year.

8223708,5,B000WM84ZE,"This is a great introduction to TNA and look back. Even though TNA isn't in the best of shape right now they are still in business and have lasted eleven years and counting. It says a lot about the company. As we learn from the documentary wrestlers didn't think it would last a week let alone eleven years. There is a nice tribute to Curt Henning. I wished they would have interviewed Scott Hall and Ken Shamrock. Both had short runs in TNA but of course Shamrock was the first champion for TNA. I thought Scott Hall helped bring some star power to TNA when it first started. I tuned in for Hall vs Killings when Hall had a shot at the NWA Title. I would have liked to see a few more matches added to the dvd but they picked four great ones. The biggest one being Raven vs Jarrett. That was an awesome match and Raven deserves credit for help putting TNA on the map. His coming to TNA was big and he helped their company a lot. He was overlooked. I liked seeing the X Division matches. I liked to see AJ Styles who I believe is and will always be the franchise of TNA. He is a great wrestler and one of the wrestlers who carried the company early on. Jarrett despite what most people think of him being the owner and putting the belt on himself the facts were he would always be in TNA where a lot of guys might not be there long term. TNA didn't have as many good wrestlers as WWE. Jarrett was still a great wrestler. He had a great ladder match with Beniot in WCW and a great match with Shawn Michaels in WWE. I liked seeing America's Most Wanted. They were a great tag team in the history of TNA. Eventually they broke up but they had a good run together. Storm and Harris are great. It was nice to hear from them in the documentary. I liked how TNA had some famous ECW wrestlers appear in the first year like Sabu, Raven, Sandman, Saturn and Credible. I think Killings and Styles were both great champions along with Shamrock and Jarrett. TNA had a good first year. Exciting X Division, Big names stars from WWF, WCW and ECW and great new talent. It's a very different TNA today but I am sure TNA will endure and not go out of business for a long time.

8223709,3,B000WM84ZE,"The documentary was slow paced and therefore feels boring, though overall the heart of the story was good.

Trust me, I watched every single one of those weekly pieces of crap. If you were expecting a WWE level production here... remember what you are watching.

The real problem however is that you cringe everytime you have to look at Bob Ryder. Why would you ever put him on camera?!? I have never seen such a thick roll of fat like his that hangs from his face and completely covers his neck. It's just... I can't describe... I remember when Bob used to sell ECW tapes and pack them with grocery store receipts. So I know exactly how he got that face...

THE HISTORY OF TNA:YEAR 1

I have to start this off by saying that I am a huge wrestling fan, I always have and always will be. With that said this is an excellent DVD to own, if you are truly interested in how a company is started you should check this out. This documentary goes into detail about the first year of this great company. You will hear from a lot of wrestlers that were there that first year as well as TNA president Dixie Carter, and announcers Mike Tenay & Don West. I think most importantly you hear the whole story from the man that created it all Jeff Jarrett. He starts from right when WCW was bought and tells the story of how this company came to be. It was real interesting to hear just how hard it was to make this happen, they had to go through some tough times to make it happen. On their opening show alone the ring fell apart right before the came on the air. Which brings me to something else, the opening to this documentary is brilliant. We open up to a black screen and hear Tenay, Don West, and the production crew doing the sound check right before they go on the air, brilliant. I really can't go into how informative this DVD is but I highly recommend it.

MATCHES

1. DOUBLE ELIMINATION X DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP-AJ STYLES VS PSICHOSIS VS SENSHI VS JERRY LYNN-this was the match that would crown the very first x division champion, in this people would be eliminated by being pinned or made to submit twice in the match. Two would start and when one would be pinned or submitted he would await his next turn while another wrestler went in. I have to say that this match was amazing; Styles and Psichosis started it off both performing at the height of their game. When Psichosis was pinned Senshi [then known as Low Ki] rushed in and went to work on Styles. It was with these two that Styles actually pulled off a hurricarana from his back; he jumped up straight off his back and hit a hurricarana. Afterwards Senshi had to sit it out while Jerry Lynn came in and made quick work out of Styles. Now it was Psichosis in with Jerry Lynn, and what happened between these two will have you remembering WCW and their cruiserweight division. But after a cradle pile driver Psichosis is sent to the back after being eliminated, and Senshi jumps straight in and goes to war with Jerry Lynn.  There is even an MMA inspired moment between these two. But it isn't enough for Senshi and he is eliminated, in comes Styles. After a great back and forth battle that Styles gets the pin, but that is only Lynn's first loss in the match. It is at this point that special referee Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat comes in and calls the insane action that follows. These two put on a show that gets me tired and I wasn't even in the match, these two battle it out with neither wanting to budge. Eventually AJ becomes the first x champ, and he earned that belt with this performance. 5/5

2. TRIPLE LADDER MATCH-X DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP-JERRY LYNN VS AJ STYLES VS SENSHI-by this time Senshi [Low Ki] was the x champ and had to put it on the line for this classic bout right here. This is pretty much a rematch of the one above minus Psichosis, and with ladders. This is honestly one of the most entreating ladder matches I have ever seen in my life, these three put on a great show. There is some really innovative stuff in this match, including something I have always wanted to see in a ladder match with multiple matches. This is one of those matches that no matter who like or dislike you wish they all could win, these guys are that good. And after what was a great finish in this bout, Jerry Lynn becomes the X Division champ for the first time. 5/5

3. TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP-AMW VS THE NEW CHURCH-next up is another great match that put former champs AMW against the current champs The New Church which was Slash and Brian Lee [R.I.P.]. this is a classic tag team brawl that put AMW on the map really in TNA. The feud these two teams had in TNA was great and really entertaining, great match up right here. The New Church really dominate most of this match over powering AMW. But Chris Harris and James Storm really prove how tough they are and what great wrestlers they are. AMW ends up taking the titles after a hard fought battle. 5/5

4. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP-JEFF JARRETT VS RAVEN-this was at the time the biggest match in TNA history in my opinion. If you had been lucky enough to be following TNA you would have seen one of the best laid out story lines in TNA. Ever since Raven had debuted in TNA he had not only become the most interesting character but his whole point of being there was because his destiny was to become NWA/TNA champion. This was Raven's first shot at Jarrett and he was there to win. This was battle and to be honest one of the best matches not only in TNA history but in each man's career. They both were bloodied by the end of this match, and both were spent. It was a back and forth battle that saw outside interference, people going threw tables, and finisher after finisher. Perry Saturn, Justin Credible, Sandman, and New Jack also appear in this match along side the Gathering to help out Raven. Sabu makes an appearance as well to help Jarrett, Sabu's exit is great as he plows through an actual fan, not a paid actor. Jeff Jarrett wins after a hard fought battle between these two, all the interference doesn't take away from this fight at all, it adds to it.

Great release, I highly recommend it.",1220745600,4,5456,4.373767258382643
8223714,1,B000WM84ZE,"You'll learn that because maybe 70% of the entire documentary is just wrestlers and management and commentators talking about how hard it was in the early days, how no one thought TNA would survive, and how they had to survive with weekly pay per views for 10 dollars each.

Over and over and over, you'll hear that, over and over and over.  You'll occasionally get some completely irrelevant story that only the most die-hard fans of... perhaps Jeff Jarrett, would appreciate, such as Dixie Carter talking about how she used to live next to Jeff Jarrett and he hit on her, and how when she went to TNA to apply for the job, she saw Jeff Jarrett and said she knew him when they lived next to each other.

The rest of the stories are very brief, and barely covered.  Oh, and you'll also get countless references to WCW.
