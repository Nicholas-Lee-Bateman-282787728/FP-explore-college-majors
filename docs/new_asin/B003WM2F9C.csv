Fascinating to watch this quiet group of people stand up and find their voice when they are confronted with natural and man made disaster. A compassionate, inspiring story that's enlarged my understanding of the New Orleans community. Must see.",1385856000,,328,5.58
8648486,5,B003WM2F9C,"This is an eye-opening, touching and inspirational documentary about a Vietnamese community in New Orleans. When Hurricane Katrina washed over the city of New Orleans, the media overlooked this ""hidden"" Vietnamese refugee community. Director Leo Chiang beautifully tells about the stories and struggles of the Vietnamese people and how they strive to fight for their rights in a place they call ""home."" A Village Called Versailles shows the unity between the young teenagers to the old grandparents who get together to protest against the government for the safety of their community. Political activism is an act that's not often seen in the Vietnamese community, and Chiang did a wonderful job portraying this new activism.

The struggles continue for the lives of this Vietnamese refugee community. The BP oil spill has affected many people whose income is solely dependent on the fishing industry. Watching this documentary will paint a clearer picture of the hardships that this community has faced leading up to the present. However, it also shows an establishment of a beautiful, tight-knit community that's often not found elsewhere.

I definitely recommend this documentary to anybody that's interested in learning more about the Vietnamese community in New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina or the power of unity between generations of old and young folks when it comes to political activism. If you are an educator, student, parent, activist, writer, etc., please show this documentary to everyone you know. This documentary showcases stories that are often not being told on T.V or books. So please spread the knowledge.",1283212800,5,1625,5.368627450980392
8648487,5,B003WM2F9C,"This documentary is really a 'must see.' It's a heartwarming portrayal of a community who bands together to fight for their home- first from Hurricane Katrina, and then from a toxic landfill that is supposed to be put in their backyard. It's so nice to watch an uplifting and inspiring film like this.",1279756800,,301,4.69811320754717
