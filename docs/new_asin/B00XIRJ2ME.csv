7168055,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"I just finished watching the documentary ""Voices"" and it is wonderful. I teach community health nursing and the course contains a unit on how the special needs of people with mental illness and how to approach their problems from a community perspective. I am going to purchase the video and make watching it a student assignment.",1431388800,4,330,4.910714285714286
7168056,5,B00XIRJ2ME,Fantastic documentary.  The directors are to be commended for their portrayal of lives of 3 families living with the disease of schizophrenia.,1473465600,,142,5.454545454545454
7168057,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"I wasn't quite sure whether I would like this documentary at first.  It's a tough topic, which most people prefer not to think about.  However, mental illness affects so many families.  The difficulty in helping these mental patients is that the patients don't believe that they have any problems, and it's hard for the family to help patients getting the proper medical treatment, and often time, without proper family support, these people often become homeless.  The film is gripping and poignant - it makes one think about how to make public health policies more effective in helping these patients and their family.",1470614400,,620,5.049019607843137
7168058,5,B00XIRJ2ME,A friends son developed schizophrenia at the late age of 43. They. Didn't understand it..this movie helped them to see that they are not alone and how others respond. Difficult for any family to go through.,1470268800,,206,4.75
7168059,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Voices is a real breakthrough in helping people see the human side of mental illness, how it cuts across people from all walks of life, across cultures and ethnic groups, and the emotional toll it has not only on the individual sufferer, but that of the family as well. It is the rare and impactful documentaries and films such as this ill help bring about a better understanding of what mental illness is like experientially and foster more humane treatment in society.  Thanks, Steve Woda, School Psychologist",1463443200,2,511,4.873563218390805
7168060,5,B00XIRJ2ME,One of the best documentaries. Very well done.,1462492800,,46,4.875
7168061,1,B00XIRJ2ME,"I was very angered by this doc. Who are the ""nut cases"" here? Definitely Aron's family,who thought it too much of an inconvenience to do anything about his ""sometimes strange behavior"" Sharon's ex, who figured she was just ""pretending,"" so ignore  her and her made up problem. As far as Thomas was concerned,his life made sense. Excellent way to save a ton of money,move to a warm,temperate climate,make sure you have direct deposit for your social security or nut checks,whichever you receive and just live on the streets. No bills,all your money is your's to do with as you please. Makes sense to me!",1459382400,,602,4.788461538461538
7168062,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"This is an important film.  Communities who wonder why people who suffer from severe mental illness languish -- either relegated to homelessness, or cycling through the criminal justice system and emergency rooms -- with little or no access to treatment, will have a better perspective.  There are many victims here -- but my heart aches for families who find it difficult if not impossible to help a family member who suffers from a brain disorder.  Our society needs to rethink the illness associated with schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, depression and other diseases of the brain -- and advocate for treatment.  No one has a ""constitutional right"" to die on our streets.",1457827200,2,675,5.109090909090909
7168063,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"The film and website are amazing.  Thank you.  I hope the effort will go a long ways towards reducing stigma and helping this underserved segment of our communities.

Along with reducing stigma, a small focus of the film is community support for mental illnesses.  I would be interested in hearing the author's ideas for improving support.  The film begs the next questions:
- In this day and age of government dissatisfaction, are sweeping reforms are necessary, or is that simply another bureaucratic nightmare?
- Do we need to have a 'general' solution balanced with a personalized, 'social worker visitation' solution?
- What is the scope of the problem?

The author's ideas would be welcomed, especially given their collective medical background.  We are future leaders who need to provide smart solutions in this chaotic world.

Thank you again for taking the time and heart to capture the challenges of our fellow people.",1455667200,,928,5.099337748344371
7168064,4,B00XIRJ2ME,For people interested in bipolar disorder. Doesnt say anything new.,1453680000,,67,5.8
7168065,5,B00XIRJ2ME,I am grateful to see this work being done. So many of us are effected and people with mental illness are misunderstood.,1450224000,,119,4.454545454545454
7168066,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"This is a beautiful movie that is profoundly touching. It captures the experience and strength of individuals with a mental health diagnosis, and it reminds us that we are not so different. It also speaks to the tragic lack of resources available for this population. I have worked with Dr. Gary Tsai, and he is a deeply compassionate doctor with a commitment to improve the quality of life for the indigent mental health care consumer. I also teach mental health nursing and I plan on incorporating  this documentary. Bravo for this insightful and brave movie.

7168067,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Voices is an amazing, intimate look at mental illness. As a police officer for the LAPD, I deal with people with mental illness on a regular basis and am also looking for more information about these conditions. This documentary was extremely informative and helped me understand a number of facets of severe mental illness that I previously knew nothing about. Eye opening. Many of the homeless living on the streets of LA struggle with mental illness issues, and what I learned from this documentary will help me with my work with this extremely important problem in Los Angeles. Highly recommend this for any one working with those with mental illness.",1449100800,2,655,4.963636363636364
7168068,4,B00XIRJ2ME,Pretty good.,1448582400,,12,5.5
7168069,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Great film on psychosis--doesn't sugarcoat, but is intimate. We showed this in our workshop and it generated a really good discussion. Highly recommended.",1447200000,,154,5.739130434782608
7168070,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"As a psychologist, I imagined there would not be much in this movie that I had not seen before.  On the contrary, it was different than anything I have read or seen, and I was moved to tears.  A powerful and intimate documentary, for any audience.",1446595200,,247,4.3478260869565215
7168071,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"I think it would be impossible to watch ""Voices""  and not be tremendously moved by the daily struggles of those individuals suffering from schizophrenia and mental illness. The challenges they face are poignantly told by the producers, and they are stories which have far too long been ignored by many in the medical community and the mainstream media. It is my hope that excellent documentaries such as this will serve to bring about greater understanding of this critical issue, and increased funding to address mental health issues at the local, state, and national level. Fantastic job dealing with this difficult topic with such sensitivity. Keep up the great work!",1445990400,,670,5.146788990825688
7168072,3,B00XIRJ2ME,"I think if you have no experience with mental illness it might be somewhat helpful.  I did not find it to be particularly compelling; the style of it is kind of boring.  But I do appreciate the effort since mental illness is such a stigma and really should not be.  The stories were encouraging since it implies that sometimes ""recovery"" is possible.  But the documentary does not really address how inadequate most communities are in addressing mental illness.  These programs and stories are unfortunately the exception rather than the rule.  But anything that raises awareness of the issues is welcome, and certainly this accomplished that goal.",1445990400,,648,5.066037735849057
7168073,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"I have only seen the trailer but cannot wait to see the entire film. The trailer provides an outstanding 'real life' view on what it is like to live day-to-day with a mental illness. Thank goodness, today, mental illnesses are treatable medical conditions. The challenge is making sure medical care is readily available to everyone living with a mental illness. Legislation and mental health care funding and programs need to catch up with the medical field so no one with a mental illness is denied access to the care he or she needs. Thank you so very much for doing this film.",1445904000,,579,4.686274509803922
7168074,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Voices chose to publicly display the struggles many families go through on a daily basis- thank you!  Not many of the general population know the suffering our family member face on a daily basis as well as the extended family trying to understand, reason and help treat this debilitating disease.  This film should be a reality check for communities and policy-makers so they too can understand this severe mental illness.",1445817600,,423,5.0285714285714285
7168075,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"This is a beautiful and moving film that presents the voices of those who are often silent and invisible.  It presents the complexity and humanity of the individual, family, and community's experience with mental illness and advocates for increased awareness, support, and intervention for those whose lives are touched by illness.  The families and community members filmed show great kindness and vulnerability in sharing their voices and this is a testament to their bravery and to the compassionate and quiet approach of the filmmakers who created a space in which the participants' voices could be heard.",1445731200,,609,5.333333333333333
7168076,5,B00XIRJ2ME,Beautiful and honest perspective on mental illness.,1445731200,,51,6.428571428571429
7168077,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Voices is a powerful and insightful look into the often misunderstood world of severe mental illness.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting to gain a clearer understanding of how tragic and heartbreaking the illness of schizophrenia is.  If you have a family member who struggles with mental illness, as I do, this one hits the mark right on.  This movie is one more drop in the ocean to help change and reform our country's woefully lacking system of care for those who suffer.  Should be required viewing for all those who work in the services of providing care to those who suffer from mental illness.",1445731200,5,616,4.728971962616822
7168078,3,B00XIRJ2ME,"Interesting material, well presented, but at my age, I need CC, especially when the content counts, as in this film. It was a little frustrating.  With CC I'd have understood and enjoyed it more.  So, 3 stars.",1443744000,,209,4.621621621621622
7168079,4,B00XIRJ2ME,"Watched this after reading an article about it on social media. I had an uncle with schizophrenia and some of the behaviors from these patients were familiar to me. However, it was enlightening to learn how varied the symptoms can be as well as how varied the impact can be on a persons life and their families life. This was not a depressing movie for me. In fact, quite the opposite. I would recommend to anyone who has any interest in mental illness, or perhaps needs a better understanding of someone afflicted.",1436572800,,515,4.608695652173913
7168080,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"I have been in the mental health system for 15 years fighting for more research and inpatient hospital stays. Our mentality Ill do not belong in jails or wandering the streets. Voices documentary was an excellent peek into the horrific but very realistic lives of the mentally ill and the repercussions to the family that most often have nowhere to turn because of lack of funding. Kudos to the filmmakers who were able to humanize what so many see as a frightening disease .

7168081,5,B00XIRJ2ME,Purchased this for use in my health classroom.  A very authentic and powerful documentary.  Excellent material for my mental health unit.,1435449600,,137,5.476190476190476
7168082,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"Voices provides an in-depth look at people and families living with mental illness that goes beyond just the usual tropes. The three stories highlighted in this film are interesting, diverse and well documented. This is an excellent and heartfelt look into the hardships and love of caring for people with mental illness.",1433721600,,321,5.1923076923076925
7168083,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"This incredibly poignant and needed documentary captures the reality of the mental health crisis we have in the US. The scenes and stories are a reminder that many times non-fiction proves to be more uproarious than fiction. I commend the directors on their coupling of health, society and art. Looking forward to seeing more of their pieces in the future.",1433635200,,356,4.95
7168084,5,B00XIRJ2ME,I thought this was a very emotional and truthful documentary on the reality of mental health in America. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help stop the stigma associated with mental illness.,1433116800,,203,4.828571428571428
7168085,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"VOICES shows the emotional truth about what it's like to care about someone with a serious mental illness.  This film is important and validating not just for family members and loved ones, but for everyone.  VOICES will make you think deeply about a difficult reality, because it will make you feel deeply.  Don't miss a chance to experience this excellent documentary.",1431475200,5,370,5.032786885245901

8716016,5,B00XIRJ2ME,"A wonderful, brief (58 minutes) documentary that traces the lives of three person afflicted with schizophrenia. The director made a brilliant choice in picking three individuals from markedly different backgrounds and shows how this devastating disease can manifest in different ways. Interviews with family members are particularly insightful and never devolve into melodrama. This is first-rate.",1488585600,2,397,6.107142857142857

8716018,1,B00XIRJ2ME,Was expecting this documentary to focus on the lives of mentally ill. It was basically about how people deal with having a mentally ill loved one as if they are a burden. Would not recommend.,1485043200,,191,4.485714285714286
8716019,2,B00XIRJ2ME,It was not very educational. The three stories were all sad. They could have shown someone living a productive life to show that there is some hope.,1478822400,,148,4.518518518518518
8716020,3,B00XIRJ2ME,While watching this movie I kept thinking about the money our government spends in other countries and yet we have people that need the proper care facilities with trained doctors and staff and not roam the streets eating out of dumpsters and sleeping on the ground.  The same with our homeless vets.,1478649600,,300,4.769230769230769
