8062177,5,B0009JOC2Y,"I bought this as my old one (which I had from when I was in my early 20's) wore out. Love her videos! Music is great, she shows you how to make the moves and reminds you to keep proper form (so important to get the results you want). There is 3 different levels. The beginner is challenging at first if you have not worked out for a while, but do what you can then stretch until next exercise set. Its better to do some of everything than to just do a few exercises. Within a couple weeks you will be able to get through the beginners sets.  She does do a cool down, but if you really feel the work out- you want to walk around and stretch for at least 20 mins after she is done with the cool down. You will be sore the next day- you will feel muscles you forgot or never knew you had, but that is a good thing. It means you are making progress and will gain definition and lose the fat layer off of those muscles. Always rest a day or 2 in between, but never more than that or you will back slide. You will get results with her videos.",1380067200,3,1036,3.933333333333333
