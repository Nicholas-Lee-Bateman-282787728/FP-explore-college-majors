8735429,3,B0161W442K,"When I first received this DVD from First Run Features (in exchange for an objective review) I thought that it would be about the environmental issues caused by the proliferation of plastic that cant be recycled. After watching the 82 minute documentary, I realize that it is more about local governmental issues and government process than the environment.

Yes, it starts out as a linear time documentary (where a filmmaker finds a subject  in this case a local activist in Concord, MA who wants to ban the sale of small plastic water bottles  and follows the story in real time, not knowing how it will end) but there are many levels here. Octogenarian Jean Hill, had placed the question on the table  (to be voted at the Annual Town Meeting) twice before and lost. We follow her in the 6 months leading up to her third time, hoping she would win.

Concord was the place best known for being the location of the Shot Heard Round The World during the American Revolution. It is also home to environmentalist/author Henry David Thoreau and Walden Pond. The filmmakers keep reminding us of these facts and there are many scenes of recreations of the war on the towns Patriot Days (which seem to occur more than once a year).  While we hear from those concerned about the environment, we also hear from those who feel that the liberty to buy a one liter bottle of water is a right guaranteed by the Constitution. One of the people against the bill is a wealthy (obvious by her clothes and house and the fact that she is a philanthropist) who comes across as trying to use her money to stop the bill. And some people make valid points. But, the center of the story is really about how small town government can run. ANY citizen IN Concord can propose an article be be voted at an in-person town meeting (that will have as many as 900 people). And  because the town council meeting are broadcast on cable TV, we can see the process.

So, I liked the concept of the film but felt they were trying to cover too many things. And  honestly  there were too many returns to the battle reenactments (to symbolize revolution?) for me.

I much preferred another First Run Features DVD on the subject of Plastic: Plastic Planet

The DVD contains about 20 minutes of deleted scenes and interviews.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
