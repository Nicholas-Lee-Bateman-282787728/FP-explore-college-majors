8279887,3,B001AVQFL6,"BEACH OF THE WAR GODS (1973) stars Jimmy Wang Yu (ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, THE CHINESE BOXER), who also wrote and directed the film. It's a historical swordplay adventure set in 1556, when Japanese pirates made frequent raids on the Chinese coastline. Wang Yu plays Hsiao Feng, a Chinese patriot who unites a group of fighters to join him in defending a seacoast village and stopping the Japanese onslaught. Wang Yu draws on Japanese samurai films for inspiration in the look and staging of the film. Certainly, the plotline bares more than a slight resemblance to Kurosawa's classic, THE SEVEN SAMURAI (1954), and its American western remake, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960). One big difference, though, is the relatively small amount of time devoted to rounding up a suitable band of followers. Wang Yu only recruits four additional martial artists as helpers, two of whom come with small armies of their own, which saves them the considerable trouble of having to train the hapless villagers.

The Japanese hit the title beach at the 50-minute mark and, after some deadly encounters involving a string of clever booby traps, it all culminates in a final 35-minute stretch (out of a 96-minute film) devoted entirely to large-scale combat between the Japanese pirates and the Chinese defenders. It's one scene of vigorous and beautifully staged swordplay after another, often with multiple sets of furiously battling combatants in the same shot. Additional exotic weapons are employed as well, including a lethal pair of shields.

The storyline is quite simple and the characters given little in the way of characterization. Jimmy doesn't even give himself much to do other than play the stoic hero directing the defense efforts. There's none of his trademark brooding on display. There are no women in the film at all. The Japanese are all played by Chinese actors. Lung Fei plays Shinobu Hashimoto, the expert swordsman who leads the pirates. Shan Mao and Tsai Hung are other familiar kung fu actors who pop up as lead players among the Japanese. Of Wang Yu's cohort, the only familiar actors are Tien Yeh as knife-thrower Leng Ping and Sit Hon as the beefy, blustery swordsman known as Iron Bull.

The film's original trailer is included on the DVD and it makes the following overstatements:
""Wide Screen Jammed with 3,500 Warriors""
""Awaited by the Public for 3 years""
""First All-Man Picture""
""Million Dollar Cast""
""Picture made for the Manly you.""
There's nothing like the hyperbole of a Hong Kong film trailer. For one thing, there are never 3500 extras in a single shot. The most in any one sequence, by my estimation, amounts to no more than 100. Which is still, to the production's credit, quite a lot for a film like this.

This all-region disc is part of Fortune Star's Legendary Collection line and was made from an original film print that shows a little wear and tear, but nothing that I found terribly distracting. The colors are nice. Overall, it's one of the better transfers I've seen in this line, from a visual standpoint. The soundtrack is another matter, however, with the post-dubbed Mandarin-language dialogue sounding pretty murky throughout. Since there's so little of it, however, particularly after the one-hour mark, this may not be such a big issue. The optional English subtitles are clear and easily readable.

This may not be the most complex of Hong Kong martial arts films, but if you're looking for high-intensity weapons work and a high body count, this one more than delivers the goods.",1226793600,4,3517,4.994880546075085
