5721027,5,B00CFB6OPC,"Spectacular movie. Great acting, touching and very realistic story, great dialogue throughout the movie and so much wit and humor. Also, this movie is literally a textbook guide to flirting and romantic chemistry.

Too bad the above three reviews did not go far beneath the surface.",1374710400,3,282,5.130434782608695
5721028,5,B00CFB6OPC,"There are three specific gifts I love receiving...something handmade, a good book and a good movie. While watching ""Crazy Kind of Love"" I knew that I had received one of my favorites. I couldn't decide whether it was the movie or the reminder of something handmade that struck that cord.

 Like smoothing my fingers over a handmade throw and finding a thread that I wanted to tuck in, I followed the thread of the story as it wove through the characters tying each one to another with a carefully crafted tension. The mother, played by Virginia Madsen as the rejected wife, gave me that cellular connection of pain that won't pass with anything other than unending time.

 The youngest son barely holding life together as he deals with the loss of ""family"" as he had known and loved it, meets the girlfriend who slides into place with quick witted humor as she tries to smooth out the gash in the fabric of their lives. I loved the slick twist of good heartedness that had me think ""she did what?"" as the older brother lets himself get to know her better.

 That well crafted tension continued, picking up the pace, until the finishing snap in the thread that gave me an ending that put a smile on my face and gave me an insightful peak at how the world turns.",1374364800,,1260,4.4803493449781655
5721029,4,B00CFB6OPC,"If you're looking for a light comedy, or if the moral integrity of characters in movies is important to you, then skip this one.
However, if you're willing to sit through a somewhat depressing movie in which a large number of the characters have no integrity, then this is worth a look.
I found it interesting that:
- The teenage son has sex with his girlfriend in his mother's house, and she just doesn't seem to care.
- The teenage boy then has his girlfriend move into his mother's house, and they continue to have sex on a regular basis, and the mother doesn't seem to care.
- The girlfriend then has sex with the teenager boy's older brother.
- The teenage boy's drug dealer starts dating the boy's mother.
In a normal movie, these characters would be portrayed in a negative light, and the ""good people"" in the movie would come to the rescue and force the ""bad people"" to deal with the consequences of their actions. However, in this movie, these characters are actually all portrayed AS the ""good people.""
Again, though, if you can ""suspend judgment"" on this oddity, it's still a well-done movie and will keep your attention.",1373500800,4,1132,4.608910891089109
5721030,4,B00CFB6OPC,"Picked this movie up for the wife, since it had a few known actors. Wife was not a fan and did not want to watch it, but we did. Once started we got hooked into this movie and could not stop.

The story starts off when the parents separate and the mom goes into depression. Wierd PHD brother moves back in, and the young brother falls in love. Love turns to depression and the girl of his life slips away.

The move really drags along once everyone gets depression, but there are alot of funny parts.

Over all everyone realizes the girlfriend was the key connection they was all missing. She turns the mother around, makes the older brother normal and falls in love. There is a big happy surprise at the end.

Over all, we got a lot of laughs out of this movie and really enjoyed it. Most fill find it crazy and long, but I really enjoyed this movie.",1373500800,,851,4.234567901234568

5721037,4,B00CFB6OPC,I ordered this because I liked some of the actors from other work they have done so thought I'd give it a shot. Not a block buster but a nice story.,1377302400,3,148,3.806451612903226

5721041,4,B00CFB6OPC,"Sometimes they make movies that aren't' destined to be blockbusters.  Sometimes you watch these veritible unknown flicks and ask ""Why'd they even make the effort for such an insipid story?""  But this one surprised me.  It caught my attention and kept it with a believable story, emotions, and actors cast in their perfect rolls.  All movies don't have to knock my socks off,  but they have to entertain me.  This one fits the bill.  If you're easily pleased then give this one a chance.  NISEY",1376352000,8,493,4.7176470588235295

8581219,3,B00CFB6OPC,"Crazy Kind of Love is one of the weirdest, most illogical movies I've seen in a while.

A mother (Virginia Madsen's character) spends her time in her bedroom depressed because the husband left, but her one son -Graham Rogers character- doesn't seem to care at all about his mother's depression.  Not even a little bit to check in on her once in a while, bring her dinner, make sure she's comfortable in bed, ask how she's feeling, etc.  A clear lack of compassion or reason.  So he runs around town partying and eventually meets a sporty/smutty young chick (Amanda Crew).  Without any storyline build-up whatsoever, they immediately fall in love.  It's not destiny- just lackluster writing.

What's more puzzling is what else occurs.  Even though Amanda should be suspicious of Graham because during a grocery store scene he immediately cuts the conversation short and runs out of the store the moment he sees a familiar girl standing behind Amanda (which should have sent up a red flag to Amanda that Graham has a history with that girl and should therefore approach him with caution) they end up in a relationship anyway.  Even more unusually, when Amanda returns to her car Graham's sitting in the passenger's seat.  What the, lol.  She should have been screaming that a stranger just broke into her car!

Anyway, after all this, they arrive back to Graham's mother's house.  They start doing it and *then* Graham reveals to Amanda that his mom is in the other room.  So not only does the boy neglect his mother, he shows how little he cares by bringing smutty girls home and doing it with them one room over to really rub it in his mother's face.  Amanda doesn't seem to care either- no embarrassment or shame afterwards, which means she probably enjoyed being informed that someone close by was listening to her um, ""sounds.""

To rub it in even more, Amanda walks into his mom's bedroom and says she's living at the house now.  Knowing the mother's vulnerable and isn't thinking straight due to overwhelming depression, she doesn't decline.  She *can't* decline.  So Amanda's selfish too.  Meanwhile the other brother, Zach Gilford, tries to be normal by socializing with his mom, but he's constantly distracted by Amanda.  She tries to introduce Zach to a girl but it fails.  So basically Amanda's a pushy unwelcomed guest, and Zach's immature around girls.  Got it.

At least the writing is correct that Zach doesn't feel comfortable with Amanda around.  But... there's more!  Amanda cheats on Graham by sleeping with Zach, but she interprets this act to mean she's helping Zach be comfortable around girls.  However the real reason she's sleeping with him is because Graham has selfishly decided he's going to ignore his poor depressed mother even more by spending all his time in the garage angrily and immaturely destroying everything his dad made, in the process ignoring his girlfriend.

And there's more.  Why is Sam Trammell's character constantly looking up at the bedroom window waiting for the mother to appear?  He's supposed to be doing yard work, not nosily looking in people's windows.  And he's doing the same yard work every single day, in the same area of the yard.  The bushes and grass are trimmed too well by this point!

Strange movie overall with a lack of real emotions.  The movie seems to make fun of the seriousness of depression, and even though Amanda's character has her moments of doing the right thing (such as baking a birthday cake for Zach) she also turns around and does a couple questionable acts.  I guess it's nice that she at least tried to bring normalcy back to this household.  Otherwise... meh.",1439596800,,3644,4.830371567043619
