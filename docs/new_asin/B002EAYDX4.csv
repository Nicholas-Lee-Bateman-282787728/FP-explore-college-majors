3916429,5,B002EAYDX4,"I just viewed this film, which I've never heard of before, on TCM.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could find a copy because I enjoyed it so much.  A very amusing script, competent cast, and though a predictable plot - it still had a couple of surprises.

I'm not a big fan of classic westerns, but this one has something for everyone.  It has all the stereo-types of bad guys (black hats), native americans (of the ""How"", and ""white man speak with forked tongue"" variety), but yet this charming film kept me watching to see what happens.  It's kind of a western drama/spoof/romance all rolled into one.  Eddie Albert does a great job as the ""dude"".  Gale Storm, while not the greatest actress, does an adequate job and is definitely easy on the eyes.

I thought it was going to be a rip-off of Bob Hope's ""Paleface""/""Son of Paleface"", but it's not.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",1326067200,3,899,4.4
3916430,5,B002EAYDX4,"A very entertaining movie somewhat like ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"".  Albert was good but let`s hear it for Gale Storm too. Also, I think Warner Archives has a lot of gall asking the price they do for these movies put on inferior discs.  Besides most of the movies in their collection are second rate  in my opinion.  This movie was one of the exceptions.",1311811200,,358,4.461538461538462

8367066,5,B002EAYDX4,"This little-known comedy-Western actually has more than its share of serious moments, which makes it, very probably, a good reflection of the way things really were in the Old West, where people used humor to defuse the dangers and privations of their environment.  The year is 1876, and Daniel Bone (Eddie Albert), a young Brooklyn gunsmith, has made up his mind to follow Horace Greeley's advice and go West: the men of his family have been in the gun trade since the days of George Washington, but Brooklyn is getting so civilized now that Daniel finds himself reduced to fixing malfunctioning cap pistols for the neighborhood youngsters.  So he packs up his books (he's a great reader) and tools and sets out for Arsenic City, Nev.  On the train he encounters Liza Crockett (Gale Storm), whose father recently died under mysterious circumstances soon after discovering a rich lode of gold.  She quickly gets the mistaken impression that he's after either her mine or a roll in the hay, and completely misses the sinister intentions of the Pecos Kid (Gilbert Roland), who's been sent east by certain criminal elements of Arsenic City to acquire the map they believe her father made of the way to the lode.  (He did, and she has it.)  In Nevada, through a signpainter's error, Daniel finds himself renamed Boone, rescues a wounded outlaw, Texas Jack Barton (Barton MacLane), who repays him by a crack over the head and makes off with his new wagon, and is rescued in turn by Miss Crockett, only to be captured by the Paiutes.  Contriving to overawe them with a few simple tricks, he finds himself with a tribe of new friends, who name him Big Wind.  But when the pair finally get to Arsenic City, and Daniel recovers his wagon and befriends an old prospector, Sam Briggs (James Gleason), who knew Liza's father, the claim jumpers still lurk.  Now Daniel must not only prove that a tenderfoot isn't a pushoverin which he succeeds so admirably that his former nemesis Texas Jack declares his intention either to get him to join up with me, or...see if he'll let me join up with him! but uncover the truth about Crockett's death and save his daughter's mine for her.  If you prefer your Western humor with a minimum of broad strokes and slapstick, and like it to give at least something of the reality while still making you chuckle, this movie is for you.",1418860800,,2355,4.708029197080292

When it came out on DVD, my kids bought us a copy and we still enjoy now and then. It is a little sappy but it is a cute western comic romance.",1406332800,,267,3.7857142857142856

8367071,4,B002EAYDX4,"Back in the day - let's say circa 1875 - those hard-livin', no-nonsense western pioneers would size up them newly arrived tenderfoots and then scoff mightily. But there are tenderfoots... and there are tenderfoots. 1948's much neglected THE DUDE GOES WEST is a rollicking western comedy and an Eddie Albert vehicle, and I jumped at the rare chance to see this underappreciated character actor featured in a starring role. Albert plays Daniel Bone (not Boone), a mild-mannered, educated gunsmith who in 1875 leaves Brooklyn to ply his trade in dangerous, disorderly Arsenic City, Nevada. This was once said of Arsenic City: ""In one week alone, they buried 57 quick-tempered gentlemen... from lead poisoning."" One thing you can say for Arsenic City: a gunsmith will always have work.

In the untamed West Daniel Bone runs into rascals and reprobates. He also catches a glimpse of Liza Crockett (Gale Storm), naive daughter of a murdered miner who's come to Arsenic City to claim her legacy. Liza has a map to her father's lost mother lode. This is no secret to any number of larcenous villains. The smitten Daniel Bone is very willing to help her file her claim, if only Liza would get over the notion that he himself is a shady character. Besides, what can a tenderfoot do anyway, burdened by soft livin' and useless book learnin'? Except that Daniel Bone is a gunsmith, and what good is a gunsmith if he can't shoot a lick? Bone's professional aptitude with firearms renders him well-equipped to cope with the hardened pistoleros who brace him in the West. It also helps that Bone keeps an innocuous pipe pistol on his person. And it turns out, his book learnin' comes in handy when he and Liza are captured by marauding Indians.

It's an enjoyable underdog story anchored by Eddie Albert's turn as the unassuming yet surprisingly steely protagonist. A solid supporting cast props him up: Binnie Barnes as the cold-hearted and calculating (and alliterative) Kiki Kelly, Gilbert Roland as the unsavory gunhand Pecos Kid, and Barton MacLane as the less unsavory Texas Jack ,a wanted outlaw who strikes up a tenuous friendship with our gunsmith. And because any western worth its salt must feature an ornery and grizzled sidekick (cackling is optional), James Gleason pops in as the requisite gold prospector. THE DUDE GOES WEST favors a light tone but never descends to caricature work. For fans of shoot-'em-ups, it even serves up moments of furious action. And if you can stand it, there's a hanging scene in which Eddie Albert drops the heavy hokum when he blisters an angry mob with a speech about the Fifth Amendment. And if you can stand it, Eddie Albert even sings a ballad or two. Roy Rogers doesn't have anything to worry about.",1349049600,2,3444,5.872255489021956
