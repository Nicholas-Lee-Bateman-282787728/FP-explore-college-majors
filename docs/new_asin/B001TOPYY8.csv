3793367,4,B001TOPYY8,"This is a good video.  I have the entire Love collection by Jannette Oke.
I always look forward to her next video coming out to complete the old west story.  If you like love stories with an old western flare and people with lots of perserverance, then you'll enjoy Love Takes Wings!",1243900800,,283,4.423076923076923
3793368,5,B001TOPYY8,"The Love Comes Softly series has wandered far off the prarie trail of the books and Janette Oke, but that does not detract from the merits of Love Takes Wings -- a thrilling new film with a quality of acting and mature dialog we have not seen in *any* of the Love movies! Doing away with much of the cliche and awkwardness that have dogged the series since Love's Long Journey, we find a simple, beautiful tale of a brave young woman's struggle with bitterness, doubt, and accepting love again. The plot is natural and unforced. Really no wierd scenes or ""no one would have said that!"" moments. Missy has only a small, letter writing role, which helps a lot. The actress who plays for her is incapable of subtility. In addition to all this, we have the pleasure of being introduced to the most charming, romantic hero yet! Jordan Bridges leaves nothing to be desired. He pursues Belinda patiently, tenderly, but is never pushy or annoying. In summary, the Love Comes Softly series is a mixed bag, with many cliches and contradictions, some dissapointing tendancies to replay worn out themes, but each film, looked at by itself, has something to offer. You don't want to miss this one.",1243641600,,1184,4.669856459330144
3793369,5,B001TOPYY8,"This was another of Janet Oake stories and I think the movie was excellent! As a woman, I enjoy stories of women who have overcome and taken on roles, which society thinks are not for them, like doctors. This is good christian entertainment and I am looking forward to the sequel on DVD, Love finds a home! I saw the movie and this is excellant also!",1243468800,,350,4.318181818181818
3793370,1,B001TOPYY8,"These movies are awful.  Love Comes Softly was the best since it stuck closest to the actual story line of the book, but the later movies are nothing like the books.  Having read and loved the books, I can't stand watching these movies.  If they are going to stray so far from the original story, then perhaps they should have different titles and not be associated with Janette Oke at all.  I'm surprised she approved of these movies being made.",1242950400,8,446,4.5375
3793371,5,B001TOPYY8,"This is a Halmark, made for TV movie that is 7th in a series. I would recomend the whole series. HOWEVER you do not need knowledge from the previous 6 to understand this movie. It's a lower budget film but great story and uplifting message.",1242691200,8,240,4.355555555555555
3793372,3,B001TOPYY8,"We were so excited to see this next movie in the series. We even watched the previous titles to refresh our memory of all the details. So when we began the 7th movie, we were very disappointed to see that Belinda was so out of character from movie 6. Why didn't Scout play Belinda? Why didn't the director at the very least have her hair color changed to match the former Belinda? And we really missed the feisty demeanor that Belinda displayed in movie 6. It was a good story, but the change in the Belinda character was a distraction.",1242518400,17,536,4.37
3793373,1,B001TOPYY8,"I was so excited to see two more ""Love Comes..."" movies coming out.  What a huge disappointment.  They were just so predictable and corny lacking the acting and story lines of the first Love Comes Softly movies.
Here are some of the things I did not like about the Love Takes Wing and Love finds a Home movies.  First of all if you're going to change the character actor could they please use someone with the same hair color?  Or wig it with the same hair color.  And personality is a must also.  The Belinda charater in these two movies had blond hair and a soft demeanor not at all like the first grown up red head Belinda.  Also back then they did NOT discuss pregnancies or lack of --- people were much more private and not telling each other all their personal problems.  Not to tell it all but be forwarned that these two movies lack the acting and plots of the first six.  Patty Duke was great!  Love her in anything!",1241049600,48,925,4.294797687861272
3793374,5,B001TOPYY8,"Another story based on the books by Janette Oke.  I cannot wait for the release of ""Love Takes a Wing"" on DVD. This story is the 7th in a series, based on the family of Clark and Marty Davis.  A heartwarming story the entire family can watch together.  I have the other 6 on DVD and I watch them over and over.",1238976000,8,310,3.967741935483871
3793375,5,B001TOPYY8,"I love this entire series and have followed it since Love Comes Softly came out a couple of years ago.  Can't wait to see the 7th in the series tonight, Love Takes Wings and the next which will be April 11 I think and has Patty Duke in it.  Although the movies don't follow the books exactly and some of the characters are different, it's still a great series and one that I'll watch over and over again. Michael Landon, Jr. is great!",1238803200,7,434,4.216867469879518

3793388,4,B001TOPYY8,"""Love Takes Wing"" is the continuing story of Belinda Davis Simpson, who has become a doctor and is traveling to a small town in Kansas with Annie, her friend that will be with her for only a few weeks. Upon arriving at the town she not only finds superstition against the children at the orphanage thanks to an outbreak of cholera - a ""poverty illness"" - but she also finds people that can help her through her recent loss and gets more than she originally bargained for.
While I tend to like the storyline in the books a little better than the movies, ""Love Takes Wing"" is a good movie and maintains the historical accuracy of the books while keeping its good characters!",1461283200,,672,4.471544715447155
3793389,5,B001TOPYY8,All mivies in this series have been well done and gentle in faith building and encouraging. Each film continues with the same characters [sometimes different actors] and the next generation in the same family. It is good family viewing.,1459209600,,236,5.076923076923077

It speaks of life over the generations with family unity, a dependence on God (NOT religion) for blessings, while explaining that when life deliveries challenges, we have help.  God IS there adding silver linings not seen at the moment, but realized afterwards.  There are many heart warming moments in these movies.  I purchased the whole series and enjoyed them all.  Note: the movies are not in chronically order.  Others rating these books have listed the correct order to watch them, if you want to see how each generation touched the next.",1386201600,,570,4.947368421052632

Due to the fact that Drew dies, she looses her faith. I wished we had a DVD of her training in medical school. Another factor is that Sarah Jones is lacking insofar as the ""Belinda,"" character. Why didn't Scout-Taylor Compton play Belinda? It would have been better to have someone with red hair? My major gripe is the yucky blonde wig that Sarah Jones is wearing. It seems to me it would not have cost that much money to have her dye her hair or get red-haired actress. Sarah Jones is a poor choice for Belinda.

Also, I disagree with those who say that faith takes a backseat in this movie.  Faith is very much front and center in the film.  I would explain more, but then I'd give away the major part of the plot.

The movie (as described in so many reviews) reminded me of the 'old times' - the old Hallmark movies or made for TV movies.  These two gals - excuse me--two women doctors come to work in two dirty, rustic and whatever you want to call crappy towns in those days (I'm sure glad I wasn't born then-yuck).
Anyway they save the day and though it's sort of predictable it never-the-less was a wonderful rememberence of the old western or western-type shows I watched as a kid. No cussing, no nudity, just plain good story where everything is horrible and then things turn and there are heros.  If you want to see a wonderful family movie get this one--it's totally worth your time and a few tears!!

I really Love this series of movies. If you like to read the books are a must. This and all the other movies it this series are prefect for the whole family.

3793509,5,B001TOPYY8,"Two female doctors Haylie Duff and Sarah Jones come to Sikeston, Missouri and none too soon. The town is in the grip of an epidemic that appears to have started in the town orphanage. It's soon identified not as a kind of influenza as was thought, but the far more deadly cholera, most common back in a time of less sanitation.

Besides having to battle the usual Victorian prejudices about women in certain male only professions, both women especially Duff have their own demons to battle. Duff in fact is a recent widow who was unable to save her husband despite her medical training. Back two centuries ago, it was common for folks to die a lot younger.

The only real support they get is from the matron of the orphanage, Cloris Leachman and from Jordan Bridges the town blacksmith whom Duff gets romantically involved with. They have a week mayor in Patrick Duffy who wants to do the right thing, but is also mindful he has to go to these folks for votes later on. Sikeston also has a rabble rouser in Lou Diamond Phillips who lost family members and is willing to just throw the sick orphans on the street and out of town.

In addition to being the Grinch of the story, Lou Diamond Phillips also directs Love Takes Wing and gets nice performances from his cast. Particularly effective are the scenes with Haylie Duff and orphan Annalise Basso who bond quite nicely in the story and on the screen.

How do they deal with the epidemic? Well it seems that Johns Hopkins has developed a brand new technique for dealing with dehydration which is how cholera kills. I won't say, but I will say that nowadays it's something taken for granted.

Which shows you that even the most matter of fact and mundane things we have now are things that someone had to think up and bring about. And prove they work.

Love Takes Wing is a nice family film from the Hallmark Channel definitely worth a viewing.",1275004800,,1894,4.523391812865497

3793513,4,B001TOPYY8,"I like this story very much.  It reminds me of all the prejudices Americans have exhibited against women and orphans in earlier centuries.  What I like best about it is the glorious soundtrack at the end, with a heavenly voice saying something like, ""...if I love, can I heal again..."" and I keep trying to capture the lyrics.  I have tried to find this female voice and this sound track on Google, but have failed.

I think that other strong points in this CD are the villain, who is really very ""villainish"" and the hotel owner, who is also a very believable villain.  The mayor is excellent in his part.

Belinda Simpson and the smithy are equally good but I find it extremely confusing being introduced to three different ""Belindas"" through three different CD's.

Lillian is excellent in her part in this one, though not so much in the next CD.  In this one, she is a winsome, really delightful child, just perfect for the part.  One loves her, and wants to adopt her.

Cloris Leachman, as Miss Clarence is superb.  Her acting throughout is as good as one could ever hope for.  She has a really marvelous, mobile face that has a wide range of expressions that one really finds believable.

All in all, I am happy with this part of the series.  But you must work hard to keep up the quality.

I am not a faith-connected person.  I choose these stories because they are decent and make me believe that there is something inherently good in these stories.  I try to take the religion stuff in stride the way I take any other extraneous element in stride.  In other words, I see the sunrise, and it is the sunrise, not necessarily a metaphor for God.

3793515,1,B001TOPYY8,"I LOVED the first two movies in this series, enjoyed some of the others, but they've really gone downhill in quality and storyline, with this movie being the worst one yet. Here are the problems: 1) Belinda is absolutely not the same character in this movie as the last one. OK, so I've seen soap operas where they changed actresses mid-storyline, but they at least try to keep the same hair color! More than that, the two Belinda actresses are nothing alike in terms of personality and spirit. 2) It was so predictable. We had the mystery source of the illness figured out in the first 30 minutes. 3) Totally unbelievable -- who would kick out sick orphans -- come on! 4) The romance is poorly developed. The proposal at the end takes you by surprise, seeing as how you never saw them together much.

In a way, this movie is more a Christian fairy tale than historical fiction. Some parts of the movie are anachronistic, such as female doctors and a frontier doctor inventing intravenous injections. Nonetheless, this is a decent family movie. The acting is good and the story is moving.

I am most anxious to get the next one ""Love Finds a Home"" as actually Sara Jones and Jordan Bridges are both returning in the continuation.  And Patty Duke!!!

3793522,1,B001TOPYY8,"I've never read a ""Love comes..."" book and this is the first movie in the series that I've seen.  It may be the last if this flick is any indicator of the quality of the others.  The story is that of two lady doctors who come west to start their first jobs as physicians.  One is recently widowed (though it took a long time for the story to get around to telling me it was her husband that she was mourning and not a brother or boyfriend).  Perceived shortcomings: 1. The acting was mediocre to say the least. 2. What was with the main character's hair?  Was she wearing a wig or what?  It looked like it and I just wanted to reach out and snatch it off of her head.  3.  The townspeople take no issue with the fact that their new doc is a woman?  What's with that?  4.  Lou Diamond Phillips, who directs the film, is cast in the roll of a belligerent townsman.  His roll in the film just ends suddenly and left me waiting for him to reappear, do something else, show remorse, find religion, something, anything.  It's weird how his storyline just stops.  5.  Suddenly, after an entire movie of Belinda telling the blacksmith ""Oh get away, I'm too sad and self absorbed to be interested in a new guy,""  BAM! he proposes and she says yes and they live happily ever after. 6.  What is with the ""I think it might be cholera"" diagnosis?  Every doctor in that time period would have known immediately whether or not it was cholera.  Epidemics were common and feared.  Good grief, 10% of the population of St. Louis was wiped out during the summer of 1849!  Cholera works quickly and with its sudden onset massive diarrhea, drains the body of a great quantity of fluid in a short time.  The cholera victims in the movie hung around for days while Belinda and her doctor companion and blacksmith buddy invented their own version of an IV set up - and that included ordering and waiting for a shipment of rubber tubing to come from who knows where to frontier Sikeston, MO.  The writers would simply have had to google ""cholera"" to get some facts.  7. I take issue with the DVD case cover - there are no snow covered rocky mountains anywhere near Sikeston, MO. This movie is a waste of time.",1248048000,2,2184,4.349009900990099

3793524,2,B001TOPYY8,"In the first seen Belinda and her friend look like two models on their way to the next photo shoot. Not like doctors on their way to a town in the old west. I can't stand the actress they picked to play Belinda. She was so expressionless and lifeless. I much prefer the darker haired actress of the prier film; she was spunky and full of life. This new girl was like ""yes I'll marry you"" with absolutely no expression or emotion.
They turned the last two films into more feminist rhetoric then a Christian message. In fact there was no Christian message.
And what is with them making the first husband of every main character die????? It's like a family tradition.

From the dreadful continuity of silver wig in one scene (why - she is young?) to the same scene but she suddenly has blonde/red hair. To over sermonising - shoving down throat (which wasn't in the first couple of ""love comes""). And most of all lack of development of character and story. The characters weren't real and you end up not caring what happened to them.

It was a good theme - ""loosing faith"" but just wasn't explored or allowed to develop correctly.

It looked like the director, producer suddenly had the smallest budget and gave up.
The last ""love comes"" wasn't as good as the others but it stood head and shoulders taller than this one.

3793531,4,B001TOPYY8,"The first three movies in the series followed the books by Janette Oke to a tee. The director in movies
in 4-8 took way to many liberties.
In the books Belinda was Marty's youngest daughter.
Melissa's husband didn't die either.
Also when is the last movie Love Finds a Home due out on dvd?",1245283200,,289,4.37037037037037
3793532,5,B001TOPYY8,I highly recommend the Love Comes Softly Series. I now own all that have been put on DVD todate. For anyone who can appreciate the simple and good things in life. They had their share of troubles but always united as a family to overcome them. Life was more simple but gave great pleasure. They are a joy to watch and maybe to reevaluate where we are today.,1244332800,,357,4.264705882352941
3793533,2,B001TOPYY8,"I own all the movies to this series. I was very disapointed with the seventh. It couldn't compare to the first two episodes. And why is it when we christians recommend these movies to our friends they have to start putting profanity in the movies? The seventh movie has a ""D"" word or a ""H"" word in it, which was unnessary. I will for now on, check and see if there is profanity in it before I purchase it.",1244246400,5,405,4.139240506329114
3793534,3,B001TOPYY8,"Having watched the previous 6 movies in the Love Comes Softly series, and read the books, Love Takes wing and Love finds a Home,  I was very disappointed that Love takes Wing was in no way related to the books by Janette Oke. What a shame to miss a portrayal of Belinda's life and travels with kindly Mrs Stafford- Smyth before her inheritance of the home and estate.
A good movie, but not Janette Oke's Love Takes Wing.",1244160000,10,420,4.384615384615385
3793535,5,B001TOPYY8,"Love Takes Wing is the latest in the Oke series which are more than ""okay"".  The whole series is one for the entire family to enjoy and appreciate.  As much as the books are an 'heirloom' to pass down to generations so are the videos as they bring the stories to life and make Clark and Missy real people to current viewers.  I grew up listening to these books (Continued Story Reading as broadcasted by Moody Bible Radio) and enjoy the fact that my children and I share the pleasure of these timeless works together.  A must view for all families",1244073600,,547,4.3861386138613865
