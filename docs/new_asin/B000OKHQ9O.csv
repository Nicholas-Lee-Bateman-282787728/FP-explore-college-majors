8185489,5,B000OKHQ9O,"These videos of Basketball start Pete Maravich are the BEST. Pete was nicknamed ""Pistol Pete"" because he was so FAST. Not only were his feet fast on the basketball court, but his hands were fast. He mastered amazing ball-handling and ball-shooting skills long before they became popular or common in NBA Basketball. He practiced for hours and hours every day all his life long. A star college player and amazing NBA star for ten years are only SOME of his credentials. His love for young people drove him to help produce the series of HOMEWORK BASKETBALL SKILLS. I enthusiastically recommend these for a young athletes.",1355184000,,619,4.904761904761905
