8429508,4,B004HGHZQA,"I adore this movie!  I first found it around 1984 in VHS format, and instantly fell in love with its soft, romantic beauty.  A group of young women (the youngest looks to be about sixteen, but I have no idea what their real ages are) are living in an old house somewhere in the idyllic French countryside.  The girls appear to be makeup-free, and their natural beauty shines through.  This is more of a series of staged tableaux than a true movie, with the loose storyline that one of their number is getting married to a local farmer and the girls are enjoying their last days together, knowing that soon their tight-knit group will be broken forever.  The mood of the film is mostly pensive, broken occassionally by soft laughter from the friends.  There is no dialogue, only background sounds and music.  Yes, there is nudity, a fair amount of it.  There are caresses between the girls, though not many (and in fact, the only ones that cross the line into sexual are between the bride-to-be and her fianc) which are sometimes punctuated with a quick, light, chaste kiss. I would classify this film as soft erotica, I guess.  Anyone looking for titillating action will probably be disappointed with it.",1503014400,,1204,4.695238095238095
8429509,2,B004HGHZQA,"This is not really and entertaining movie. The beauty of the starlets just doesn't make up for the lack of story and..., creativity. Can't reccomend.",1286064000,,149,5.0

8429511,2,B004HGHZQA,"I can only give this flick 2 stars for an attempt to provide some kind of cinematically induced inspiration, for the setting where it was filmed in. it was not very inspiring nor provided any surprises at all. other than girls running around nude in slow mo, and then a ""peck"" on the lips as if the girl really felt no passion whatsoever,  or was detested at having to show some kind of feeling, (my grandmother gives a better kiss), so if it was ""suppose"" to be a mature theme, it wasnt. the imagination of the entire silent movie was as if the artist really wasn't inspired, or motivated, or  interested in providing ""something"" which could have touched the human heart. if this is suppose to be erotica, it was more like a commercial for a travel agency showing perhaps a nude beach. I can say something positive, a tune or two in the film was fun to listen too, but thats all. it ended quickly and without producing any sort of (gee, this really was an attractive film) sort of feeling. Its overly priced. i would expect to find this in the $2.50 bin at K-MART.  forget this film.",1251244800,,1084,4.41
8429512,1,B004HGHZQA,"This is absolutely the most boring and inaccurately portrayed movies of all time. Imagine a Monet painting being shown on film, with no dialogue, for several hours. Boring, right? Even after you checked out the ballerina's breasts? That's this film.

My first problem with this film is the premise: that girls at a girls' school would choose to caress and share tender moments with one another. Everyone knows that women of this age are just beginning to use their claws, and--like puppies--their claws are now the sharpest they will ever be. Every one of these girls should be in a mad, jealous, catfight to appeal to the few men in the film--but instead, they seem to want solely to touch one another or play mild, hilarious pranks.

Secondly, the ""artistic"" mood detracts from the pornography (if you're into that), and the ""pornographic"" scenes detract from the artistry. This film is an overall loser, neither here nor there, that deserves nothing more than your contempt.",1214092800,7,977,4.951219512195122
8429513,4,B004HGHZQA,"This film definitely has unique beauty. What it is interesting about this film, is that it is neither pornographic, neither can be today viewed as purely erotic experience. Although I think that today David Hamilton might even be prosecuted for his images, it can not be denied that this film (as it is the case with many other Hamilton's work) is in a way truly aesthetic. But today it lacks what we are so much used in contemporary production: the ""true"" story. So this film is much more similar to certain avant-garde films (form dominates over the content) as its base is purely visual. It is of that type that it should take purist to turn his or hers head away from astonishing images Hamilton took more than twenty years ago. A true experience, but consider it rather as a ""screen saver"" than a movie.",1197417600,5,808,4.5793103448275865
8429514,4,B004HGHZQA,"Some might consider this movie pornographic because of the frequent nudity of the girls.  However, it reminded me more of a soft-focus photo essay on the natural beauty of young women than anything erotic, depicted in much the same manner as the nudes painted by countless master artists.  There is no dialogue, but it does tell a story of one girl falling in love and getting married.  This is a very unusual movie, but tastefully done - as are most of David Hamilton's photos of adolescent girls.  I suspect that it is diminished due to its age, however, and needs to be restored to its original glory.

Just as an aside, Saint Tropez is where topless bathing first started in modern Europe.  I've heard that it was there that totally nude sunbathing, such as depicted in this movie, first began in Europe.  However, when I was there in the early 1990s, we could hardly find a topless beach, much less a nude beach.  Also, if you visit the town, be sure to take a map because it has the most mixed up street plan I've ever seen in any town.  Without a map, it might take you half an hour to stumble your way out of the village!",1181606400,28,1129,4.389423076923077
8429515,3,B004HGHZQA,"A masterpiece of visual art. No question about it. Unfortunately, the DVD quality is disappointing, partly because David likes to use diffusion filter in photography, partly may because the movie is old. Same problem with the DVD for Laura. I do wish we have new movies like these with top visual quality, that is a must for David's works!!!",1125705600,24,341,4.796610169491525
