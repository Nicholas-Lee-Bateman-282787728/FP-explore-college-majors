680816,4,6303562477,"Based upon Joseph Conrad's thrilling novel THE SECRET AGENT, this is a carefully constructed Hitchcock chiller dealing with terrorism and bombs that might go off any minute.  Sidney plays Sylvia (!) a shy woman whose husband - the moody, sullen Homolka - is a saboteur who uses his movie theatre as a front for his dark activities...There is a fascinating scene where Sydney learns of her brother's death in a theatre. Just afterwards, Disney's cartoon WHO KILLED COCK ROBIN? plays and Sydney can't help but to laugh along with the audience.  The scene where Sydney wordlessly stabs Homolka after staring at his back for a long period of time works brilliantly.  Sidney told Hitchcock that she didn't think the scene would play: later, upon watching the rushes, she had to admit it was one of the most powerful of her entire career. Hitchcock's detailed sets are likened to the London of his childhood; he even had a streetcar line built at a cost of $30,000; the set would be seen for only a few minutes in the film.  Gaumont executives thought this was a foolish waste of money, but in his foresight, Hitchcock cleverly wanted American moguls to witness his ingenious craft. Once Hitchcock began working in the U.S., the budgets for his films were astronomical by comparison.",1030665600,,1277,4.844036697247707
680817,5,6303562477,"Sabotage is a very good movie, full of suspense and black irony. This is the story of a treacherous living in London with his wife and her brother. He indulges in undesirable practices like the sabotage of a power station.  Being watched by the police, he decides to leave a bomb at Piccadilly. The  movie is not considered as important movie in Hitchcock filmography. Yet  there is in the movie one of the strongest hitchcockian scene with a  terrible death, this scene would not be possible in an American film (you  will understand if you watch the movie). This death is the central point of  the plot and conduce to another strong scene at dinner time.  Sabotage is  very dark, perhaps the most dark in the English period of Alfred Hitchcock.  The central murder scene is shocking and could be compared to the shower  scene of Psycho for the surprise induced by the brutal death. Sabotage is  definitely a dark Hitchcock movie.",955497600,,931,4.685185185185185

680880,2,6303562477,"Not to be confused with The Saboteur, Hitchcock's first American-made motion picture.  The motion picture Sabotage is very loosely based on Joseph Conrad's short novel The Secret Agent.  I say ""very loosely"" because the motion picture's unsatisfying ending is completely different and out of synchrony with the rest of the plot, the real villain is hardly noticed, his motives are not discussed to any intelligible degree, and on and on.  As a motion picture, it is not well done; as a Hitchcock motion picture, it's probably one of his poorest.

I have seen two other film treatments of Conrad's novel, and they suffer from even worse defects.  Tom Wolfe has pointed out that a work of great literature cannot be made into a great motion picture; his example is Anna Karenina, which in all five treatments that I have seen is, as a motion picture, merely a soap opera.  (If any of these motion pictures has put you off from reading Anna Karenina, let me advise you to read the book; it's one of the great works of literature.  Similarly, Conrad's The Secret Agent is a very good book, very much worth reading even though it isn't typical Conrad.)  The motion picture The Secret Agent is interesting only for students of Hitchcock who are studying his developing skills as a director.

680881,4,6303562477,"Early Alfred Hitchcock thriller, set in late 1930s London.  A Scotland Yard detective posing as a fruit stand salesman, is casing this small London theater, watching this man who may be involved in terrorist activities.

The film starts where there is a sudden blackout across London.  Some men show up and each says only one or two words:  ""Sabotage!""  and ""On Purpose!""  Quite dramatic.  The English though get together and start to laugh about it.

The newspapers read ""London Laughs at Blackout!""

Well, the instigator {Velock} and his boss (a mysterious guy in a bowler hat who hangs out at the zoo of all places) meet and the boss is not happy.  He arranged to have our reluctant fellow plant some explosive at Piccadilly Circus.  Our boy is desperate for money and so goes along with the plan.

Saturday is set.  Velock gets a note: ""London must not laugh on Saturday"".

Meantime our detective friend's cover is blown!

Meantime, while our detective friend is still trying to get info from Velock's wife, Velock receives a bird cage.  (One of the terrorists is an explosives expert who runs a bird shop as a front).  Inside the case is a small box.

Velock leaves with it.  The suspense builds as you sympathize with Velock's wife, who has no clue that her husband has gotten involved in terrorism, heartache for the detective who clearly likes the guy's wife and kid, and terror as no one but a select few know where the bomb is to be planted.

Velock can't leave the theater for fear of police involvement, so he uses his wife's 12 year old brother to take the package away to a cloakroom at the Circus.  The cad!  Trouble is, this boy gets distracted easily.  And as you see him hanging out with this time bomb, it's really scary!

The audience can only guess what device is in this wrapped box!  Will it detonate?  Yikes!

Hitch keeps showing clocks, 1:15 is getting closer and closer as our boy is watching a parade!  OMG!  Everything is so sweet & innocent, life goes on as death is in their midst.  Amazingly done.

And people do die in this film.  Indeed so!

I'm leaving a lot out of the story so as to avoid spoilers, but I really like the action and the building of suspense here.  The film has a different pacing than his later American films, but has that suspense, through expert photography and script, to keep an audience on the edge of their seats.

680882,1,6303562477,"Let's see now.  If you were working undercover for New Scotland Yard, would you (a) make a pass at a suspected terrorist's  wife and then compound matters by (b) telling her what you are up to?  If you were a film Producer, would you use obviously cheap (and artificially cramped) street sets instead of allowing filming on the streets of London?  If you were in charge of visual effects, would you use blatantly obvious fake (and blurry) rear-screen projection for major street scenes?  Finally, if you were the Director, would you want to associate yourself with such a lame script and minimalist production values?  If you were Hitchcock in 1936 and still working in the UK, the universal answer is ""yup.""

 SABOTAGE has ""C List"" written all over it.  The story concept is underwhelming, the dialog is naive, Oscar Homolka (the terrorist) seems to think he is in a silent film, and Sylvia Sidney's performance (as the terrorist's wife) is under whelming (as is her hair style and silly hat)--she apparently hated her Director and the feeling seemed to be mutual.

 The result is most curious given the Director's reputation for script control and the use of storyboards he would himself draw.  Take the ending: a bomb maker arrives at the terrorist's home/business with out a bomb, but still manages to blow up the joint!  Maybe a few storyboard sketches fell off the board?!

 Hitchcock had some major ups and downs with his films.  This one is clearly a downer!

What I especially love about this series is the excellent remastering that was done with them.  The old copy of ""Sabotage"" that I have is dark and not clear.

680885,4,6303562477,"The Bottom Line:

Though it lacks the narrative thrust and humor that characterize Hitchcock's later work, Sabotage is a suspenseful and brief thriller that hints at what the master had cooking for us in later decades; recommended mainly to fans of Hitch, it's a good but not great film.",1233792000,,287,4.857142857142857
680886,5,6303562477,"This moody thriller from Hitchcock's British period blends a somber and tense storyline with a budding romance borne from circumstance; something that would become a staple of his American films. While it may be just a tick below ""39 Steps,"" ""The Lady Vanishes,"" and ""Young and Innocent"" from the same period, it isn't far behind.

One of the reasons it reaches the level it does is the lovely Sylvia Sidney. She is simply fantastic as a girl in a dangerous and somber situation whose smile ignites the screen every single time it happens. She is married to Oscar Homolka who seems harmless enough but in fact is a saboteur.

British police are hot on his trail and as Ted (John Loder) tries to discern whether Sidney is involved or just an innocent bystander, he falls in love with the sweet girl who takes movie tickets and cares for her little brother Stevie.

The audience falls for Sidney too in this film based on Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent. The photography of Bernard Knowles adds atmosphere and tension to some truly exciting moments in Charles Bennet's screenplay. The film starts slowly but gradually draws the viewer in because they care about Sidney.

When the sabotage escalates to a bomb intended for Picadilly, Sylvia's husband uses young Stevie to deliver it. But he is delayed and the viewer is on the edge of their seat watching the clock tick down while Stevie rides the double-decker, the outcome very much in doubt. Sylvia's fate will be in doubt also as an impulsive act will have Ted trying to shield her from the consequences because he loves her.

This film has been in need of a quality release for a number of years, and is finally getting one. A commentary with Hitchcock author Leonard Leff, a Peter Bogdanovich interview with Hitch, a restoration comparison and still gallery are included on this long awaited release. According to the studio, it will also be close captioned, and have French and Spanish subtitles for those who need such. A great ending makes up for the slow start in a film carried by Sidney's bee-stung lips and smile like sunshine. Hitchcock fans don't want to dismiss this one from his British period. You'll become a fan of Sidney's after watching this one.",1231113600,5,2212,4.765013054830288
680887,4,6303562477,"Director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) began his career designing title cards for silent films. In 1925 his directorial debut, THE PLEASURE GARDEN, was considered such a flop that it was shelved until the later THE LODGER, his first thriller, proved a sensation at the box office, and although his early films vary in terms of subject thrillers quickly became his genre of choice. Released in 1936, SABATOGE does not quite reach same level as the earlier THE 39 STEPS, but it is obvious that Hitchcock is already strongly entrenched in the genre.

The film is loosely based on the Joseph Conrad novel THE SECRET AGENT. Mr. and Mrs. Verloc (Oskar Homolka and Sylvia Sydney) own and operate a cinema in London; Mrs. Verloc's brother Stevie (Desmond Tester) resides with them. Unbeknownst to Winnie Verlock, her husband is a saboteur; as the film progresses he is instructed by his handlers to place a bomb in Picadilly Circus. Unbeknownst to Mr. Verloc, investigators are already on to him--and he and his family are under survelliance by investigator Ted (John Loder.)

The film is famous for two sequences, both of which were considered very shocking at the time and both of which show Hitchcock's method of creating and intensifying suspense in cinematic terms. In the first, the innocent Stevie is duped into carrying the bomb to Picadilly--but is repeatedly distracted and delayed until the bomb explodes on a bus. In the second, Winnie has learned of her brother's death and in a mixture of shock and passion stabs her husband at the dinner table.

According to film lore, actress Sylvia Sydney was outraged when Hitchcock refused to let her ""act"" the stabbing scene, instead instructing her how to move her eyes and hands in a series of close-ups. These close-ups, however, were part of a carefully designed sequence calculated to build suspense, and the result was remarkably powerful... and Sydney was delighted with the result.

Overall, however, SABOTAGE belongs to second tier of Hitchcock's films and time has taken an additional toll. It will be of more interest to hardcore Hitchcock fans than casual viewers--and they are likely to be frustrated by the nature of the print available, which is only adequate at best. Recommended, but primarily for aforementioned fans.

The film begins in London at night. Suddenly the lights go out due to a power failure. Could a simple substance like silicon dioxide sabotage a big city? A blackout in peacetime? Will the patrons of the cinema get their money back? Mr. Verloc seems unconcerned. He is the owner operator of this small business, its not a big corporation. Is the grocer next door too interested in the cinema? Do terrorists stir up trouble at home so people ignore foreign news? Or is that how the news is played. Verloc meets his controller who asks him to leave a ""parcel"" at Piccadilly Circus to terrorize the population. Ted befriends Mrs. Verloc and her son at a restaurant. Verloc is under surveillance, they know who he meets and where he goes. The talk in the movie is meant to be ironic.

Ted notices friends of Verloc going into the cinema. [A great place for surreptitious meetings.] Ted is known to one of the conspirators, the operation is cancelled. [Undercover operatives should never be part of official operations.] Ted returns to question Mrs. Verloc. Verloc sees this and decides to use her son to carry the ""parcel"" along with some movie reels to avoid surveillance. Stevie walks through the London crowds on his destination. A parade through the streets delays him while time marches on. [There is always the unexpected in any plan.] The suspense comes from knowing the people in the film are oblivious to the danger that is around them. There is bad news!

Verloc blames others for his actions. A cartoon serves as an echo on the events. A mistake leads to rough justice, Verloc will not talk about this conspiracy. Ted and Mrs. Verloc have bonded. The police arrive to arrest the bomb maker and Verloc, but do not succeed. The film tries to create a happy ending; it doesn't work. This story about terrorists with bombs is not obsolete today. This film is adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent"". Was the novel better? Plots by anarchists were a danger from the end of the 19th century. Was there a similar threat in more recent times? Note the very large crowd scenes, you won't see this in later movies.

Perhaps you should know the background of this time (the Great Depression, the growing power of fascist movements) to best appreciate this story. Hitchcock's later films were better (less censorship?). Note his recurring interest in films about people who are not as they seem.

Mr. Verloc runs his theatre with the assistance of his beautiful wife Sylvya (Sylvia Sydney) and her teenage brother Stevie (Desmond Tester).  However, neither Sylvya nor Stevie know of Verloc's real occupation and underworld dealings.  An undercover detective from Scotland Yard, Ted Spencer (John Loder), is assigned to work near the cinema and investigate Verloc.  But before Ted can unravel the secrecy in which Verloc cloaks himself, Sylvya and Stevie are unwittingly involved in a conspiracy that brings a terrible tragedy.

Criticized initially for the seemingly violent suspense sequence, the film is a faithful adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book.  Hitchcock is known universally as having been a masterful director.  Films such as REAR WINDOW, DIAL M FOR MURDER, PSYCHO, and THE BIRDS expanded the scope of film.  These films are all masterpieces, but it is in many of Hitchcock's earlier films, such as SABOTAGE, that one begins to fully appreciate the genius of Hitchcock.

The film features no star players, moves at a rather slow pace, and has very little action.  Yet, SABOTAGE is one of the better spy-thriller movies that I have ever seen.  Hitchcock was a grand master at only showing the audience what they needed to see and leaving the rest up to their imagination.  Most filmmakers askew that type of filmmaking nowadays and the ones that don't only do it in one genre.  Hitchcock could do it well in any genre.

It has a realism that I think is refreshing along with the suspense.  I can imagine for the times in England these themes of distruction from a foreign enemy haunted the English mind.  A story teller's delightful imagination can take over as this film does.  Also, I am a fan of Sylvia Sidney, the wife and sister in the film, for if there is a better actress who can protray distress I would like to know who.

680951,5,6303562477,"The genius of Hitchcock is best seen in his early British films.  Back in the 1930s, working with relatively unknown actors and actresses, low budgets, and seemingly rather straightforward scripts, Hitchcock's eye for detail, unique mastery of cinematography, framing, and lighting, and most of all his unsurpassed ability to generate suspense put him in a directing class all by himself.  Speaking of suspense, Sabotage packs a particularly nasty punch in that department, resulting in what I consider one of the most memorable cinematic sequences in my own personal experience.  Those excruciating moments, and the events they set in motion, make Sabotage a disarmingly powerful, surprisingly emotional film.

The story, adapted from a Joseph Conrad novella, centers around a seemingly harmless cinema run by the Verlocs, foreigners seemingly well-adjusted into life in London.  Karl Verloc (Oskar Homolka) is apparently supposed to be German (he sounds a lot like Bela Lugosi, so I initially took him for an eastern European of some sort), while his wife Sylvia (Sylvia Sidney) and her brother Steve (Desmond Tester) came over from America a year earlier.  The film opens with a blackout of London, a happenstance we quickly learn to be an act of sabotage committed by Mr. Verloc.  Scotland Yard, already suspicious of the man, has a man working undercover at the neighboring grocery (John Loder), but he doesn't have enough evidence to nab the guy.  As he cozies up to Mrs. Verloc to see if she knows anything, the mysterious group Verloc is reluctantly working for make plans for a much larger demonstration of their presence (using terrorism to distract England's attention from what is already taking place on continental Europe in this year of 1936).

As you can see, the viewer knows exactly what is going on and exactly what is planned for the near future, but rest assured that Sabotage is in no way lacking in the suspense department.  The critical scenes in the movie are rather excruciating and even a fair bit shocking, setting up an ending that might look rather clich&eacute;d on paper but proves quite fascinating onscreen - in large part due to Hitchcock's masterful direction.  Raw emotion radiates off the screen as Hitchcock proves, even at this relatively early stage of his career, that he is much more than a mere master of suspense.",1166313600,3,2358,5.082901554404145
680952,4,6303562477,"There are probably still some purists out there who feel that the work of Alfred Hitchcock really began to falter after his move to America in 1940. At the time this was quite the deal in the world of film, and there were more than a few critics and industry insiders who from then on thought of Hitchcock as a bit of a sellout. Hitchcock had earned his reputation in England directing films that, while low on budget, were more than high on suspense, excitement, and talent. Their financial limitations and removal from the Hollywood system gave the films a sparse, yet brilliantly photographed and desperately urgent feel uncommon to the banality of many American productions. Among these early films lies ""Sabotage,"" a film slightly scant on story and somewhat emotionally muddled, but nevertheless at times terribly suspenseful and honestly affective.

The movie's story is somewhat ambiguous and the film itself seems almost aware of its unimportance, only bothering to offer a few scant lines of dialogue to explain the motivation of the saboteur. Karl Verloc (Oskar Homolka) is the owner of a cinema in London who also commits acts of sabotage for a terrorist organization, in, it is explained, the hopes of drawing attention away from larger plots afoot on the continent. Who Verloc is working for, or for what particular reasons, personal or professional, are never made abundantly clear, but given that the film was made in 1935 and Verloc is a German immigrant, one can assume that the film was meant to serve as a warning of the trouble brewing in Europe. But the film does not seem fully committed to this theme, and the set-up suffers because of it. The film also centres on Verloc's wife (Sylvia Sydney) and her brother Steve, who are unaware of Verloc's little hobby, but soon find themselves swept up in the intrigue surrounding his treacherous dealings. John Loder plays the next door grocer, Ted Spencer, who we soon find out is actually an undercover Scotland Yard detective who keeps tabs on Verloc while making passes at his wife.

Hitchcock is famously quoted as saying that a scene of a man with a bomb under his chair is not suspenseful unless the audience is aware of the bomb while the man is not. ""Sabotage"" quite literally takes this advice and through its use finds a scene of such tension and anxiety that it truly makes the film. The lead up to this scene in intriguing, and the remainder of the film somewhat devastating (if not a tad jumbled), but the scene of Steve's trip to the London Underground is among the finest of any Hitchcock film. One of the true virtues of this scene, and of the film as a whole, is the cinematography, which at times is heartily reminiscent of the best of German expressionism. The way in which Hitchcock, along with director of photography Bernard Knowles, frames and lights his close-ups is often masterful, and works to fully render the tension and conflicted anarchy of Verloc and the film as a whole. Watch for the scene where husband and wife talk in close-up confinement, until she leaves and abandons him and the camera pulls away to show Verloc alone in the now noticeably spacious frame, and you will see Hitchcock's eye for the expressiveness of the medium. It is with such touches that Hitchcock manages to bring an incredible amount of value and intrigue to a film of such basic plot.

The end of the film gets lost a bit in its rather forced romantic sub-plot. Spencer's final perusal of Mrs. Verloc comes across as highly inappropriate, but considering her reaction I do believe that this sentiment was somewhat intended. Sidney is marvelous in this latter part of the film and scenes such her looking for her brother in a crowd are heartbreaking. The finale is a bit too deus ex machine to blend in seamlessly, but the film has enough honest emotion and unapologetic suspense to more than make up for its shortcomings. I have seen only a handful of Hitchcock's UK films, but with them one sees a Hitchcock without the stars, without the large budgets, without the exotic locales; a Hitchcock totally dependent on the sense of scenario and tremendous talent behind the camera that first earned him his reputation. I think most would agree that Hitchcock went on to prove his critics wrong with an illustrious and always interesting American career, but with films such as ""Sabotage"", where his talents are revealed at the roots, you can see why the purists were initially skeptical.",1153267200,3,4462,4.799739921976593

This was a pre WWII film that foretold the war.  Oscar Homlika plays a German &eacute;migr&eacute; living in London.  He is married to a sweet younger woman (Silvia Sidney) who is looking after her young brother.  For the brother this is a dream come true, living above a movie cinema.

Carl Verlock is working with a group of German agents in London but his wife and her brother are ignorant of his activities.  But Scotland Yard has begun to suspect him.  Carl is only interested in passive sabotage where no one is directly hurt (like causing blackouts.)  But he is asked to plant a bomb.  Reluctantly he does.  But when things start to go wrong and he cannot deliver it himself, he enlists his young brother in law to deliver the bomb.  The brother gets delayed by a parade and is killed by the bomb.

Little by little, Mrs. Verlock figures out that Carl is involved with her brother's death and takes justice into her own hands.

This is one of the films that Hitchcock received early fame with.  It helped establish him as a master of suspense.

I must say that this print is a little blurry at times but I have seen copies on AMC which are just a bad.  This is an early film and British.  Most restorations and preservation of films have been with early Hollywood films.  Therefore, this is probably the best collection of existing prints.

The movie opens with the power in London going out.  People are screaming.  In a quick cut to the power supply place, we learn that it must be sabotage done with sand.  Then it's cut to the movie theatre where Mrs. Verloc is trying to keep the patrons down in the candlelight, telling them they can't afford to give their money back.  Mr. Verloc sneaks past, without her seeing him.

Upstairs in their house, Mr. Verloc washes his hands off and we see the sand in the bottom of the sink.  The movie progresses from there as we learn of Mr. Verloc's sabotage and his orders to put a bomb on Picadilly Street.  Because he's being closely watched by a Scotland Yard detective posing as the next-door vegetable store owner, Mr. Verloc sends Stevie to drop the ""package"" (bomb) off in a cloak room at Picadilly Street.

We watch Stevie in horror...

One of the best scenes of the movie is when Mrs. Verloc picks up the carving knife at the dinner table and we see her anger rising against her husband.  The whole scene lasts perhaps a minute or so, but is completely silence.  There is no conversation, just superb acting.

Oscar Homolka, who plays Mr. Verloc, is an excellent actor, just sometimes hard to understand because of his accent.  Sylvia Sidney, in the role of Mrs. Verloc, demonstrated her superb acting ability in this tough role.

Hitchcock has always regretted the scene where we watch Stevie carrying the package (or bomb) throughout the city as it built up the suspense to a tremendous level before a huge let-down.  I think I agree with him, though some critics think it is perfect the way it stands.

The filming is classic Hitchcock and he makes it seem, after a point, something like a dream.  The characters seem to be well-developed and the ending abrupt but ironic.  A movie worth watching-even if it was made in 1936!",1135555200,6,2061,4.579234972677596
680958,4,6303562477,"Sabotage was a serviceable Hitchcock tale of espionage while he was still making films in England.
The flick is based around the machinations of Mr. Verloc, a foreign spy and saboteur based in London and played by the sinister bushy eyebrowed Oskar Homolka.  His wife played by Sylvia Sydney, who together with Homolka run a cinema, is clueless as to his clandestine activities.  The film opens with Mr. Verloc causing a widespread power outage by fouling the generators with sand
A Scotland Yard detective played by John Loder is working undercover at a fruit and vegetable store next to the cinema, suspicious of Homolka and watching him.  Unable to carry out his next act of terrorism due to the surveillance, Homolka commissions Sydney's young brother to unwittingly transport and deliver a package containing a bomb.  Tragically, traffic delays cause the bomb to explode prematurely, killing the young boy and other passengers on the bus he was on.
In very atypical fashion, Hitchcock has a totally innocent victim fall prey to violence.  He, however, followed the movie morality code of the time in this case as the villian gets his just desserts.  Justice is served and vengeance is meted out.",1044835200,5,1200,5.005025125628141

7850181,2,6303562477,"I am not a fan of this film. It seems to be very highly over-rated by critics and others. I do love Hitchcock films in general, but this is a very ""clunky"" film that is well-below normal Hitchcock standards. The characters throughout the film behave in a most-unrealistic manner. That's the thing that really detracts. For example, when Mrs. Verloc (the wife) and Mr. Verloc (her husband, and sabateur) find out that Mrs. Verloc's kid brother has been blown up in the bombing incident, they really do not react in a any fashion that we would consider ""normal"" today. Their behaviors are so abnormal as to make me wonder why no critics are pointing this out. It's amateur hour in depicting ""grief"" -- if that's what you want to call it. Mrs. Verloc does not even appear very upset when her husband confirms that,yes, it was he who gave to bomb to the boy to carry. [ Yes, I know she's thinking maybe she should stab him. That scene, again, was very amateurish. And, she successfully stabs him -- and he dies immediately.]

There are many instances of ""what the?..."" regarding human behaviors depicted in this film. I won't belabor the point, though. [Does anyone notice that there was absolutely no sense of chemistry or love or affection between husband and wife?  I didn't even realize they were supposed to be a married couple at first. I thought he may have been her long lost uncle. So, any resemblance to real people is strictly coincidental in this film.] Sorry-- it really ""bugs"" me that so many consider this a great film, when it clearly is not.

The cinematography is good, though. Typical Hitchcock, with unusual angles, etc. The characters behave in a nonsensical manner. The plot is OK, but the idea that Mr. Verloc is under suspicion because he claimed to be sleeping when the the electricity failed by sabotage -- but several people said , no, he was ""out"". That is ridiculous. That's your basis for questioning whether somebody is a terrorist? [Compare this to today's world: Say, you don't know anything about the ""school bombing"" because you were sleeping, and somebody says-- no,"" He wasn't sleeping!"" ""Arrest that man! He must've done the bombing!""  Ridiculous. But, that is what happens in this film, essentially.

Overall, this is a bad film. But, for it to be a Hitchcock film, that makes it very disappointing.",1510185600,,2334,4.753086419753086

Made without the resources that going to Hollywood provided him, it is still a gripping, down to earth production, filmed with the finesse which so marks everything the director had a hand in making. Oscar Homolka, as always, is first rate as the villainous movie house owner and John Loder ably supports the stars as a plainclothes police officer. What is there to say about Sylvia Sidney, then at the peak of her long, distinguished career. She is touching (and truly beautiful)  as the young wife of Holmolka's character. What a treat to see her at her vulnerable best before, whatever may be the reasons, she began to fade as a film star, while still enjoying a long, productive career in other venues.

7850183,5,6303562477,"SABOTAGE [1936 / 2015] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Alfred Hitchcock's Most Significant Mystery Melodrama Pre-war British Film!

Celebrated for the macabre, tour-de-force plots and sublime twist endings that would come to define the very genre of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's greatest auteurs, his career spanning six decades and over sixty films. Based on Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent and starring Oscar Homolka and Sylvia Sidney, SABOTAGE is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most significant pre-war British films. Featured here in a High Definition transfer from original film elements, this classic early thriller has never looked better.

Karl Verloc, manager of a London cinema, is secretly involved with a gang of European saboteurs who are plotting a massive bomb attack in Piccadilly Circus. With the police already suspicious of Karl Verloc, they place an undercover detective on his trail and can he bring the saboteurs to justice before they perpetrate their outrage on London?

FILM FACT: The fact that many scenes of the film were set in a cinema allowed Alfred Hitchcock to include references to contemporary films and storylines. Perhaps the most famous of these is the final film sequence, an excerpt from a Walt Disney Silly Symphony Who Killed Cock Robin? [1935]. Alfred Hitchcock wanted to cast Robert Donat (with whom he had previously worked in The 39 Steps) as Sergeant Ted Spencer, but was forced to cast John Loder due to Robert Donat's chronic asthma. Alfred Hitchcock also chose the young Bobby Rietti (later known as Robert Rietti) to play the part of Steve, but was not able to sign him for legal reasons. Mrs. Verloc was Sylvia Sidneys only role for Hitchcock. Reportedly, they did not get along and she refused to work for him again.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In 1936 the idea of a terrorist blowing up a bus in London's Piccadilly Circus was an unimaginable and somewhat outrageous conceit. Yet that action provides one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous and controversial sequences in SABOTAGE [1936], an adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel, The Secret Agent (the novel of the title was actually the name of Alfred Hitchcock's previous film, which was based on W. Somerset Maugham's ""Ashenden"" adventure stories, hence the need for a new title). At the story's centre is Karl Verloc [Oscar Homolka], the owner of a cinema theatre and a member of a secret terrorist organization bent on destroying London. His wife Mrs. Verloc [Sylvia Sidney] is completely ignorant of her husband's activities until a government agent Det. Sgt. Ted Spencer [John Loder], pretending to be a grocer, arouses her suspicions, but not in time to prevent a terrible tragedy.

Alfred Hitchcocks 1936 film SABOTAGE [The Woman Alone USA Title] is one of the masters of suspenses earlier efforts, but it once again shows why hes one of cinemas greatest directors and based on Joseph Conrads The Secret Agent. The SABOTAGE film opens with a definition of the word sabotage which states wilful destruction of buildings or machinery with the aim of alarming a group of persons or inspiring public unease.

SABOTAGE holds up very well in the 21st Century. The central themes on terrorism within the British capital are even more relevant today in 2015 than they were when Alfred Hitchcock first made the film in the 1930s. Thats what makes the movie such essential viewing today and the concept of terrorism hitting at the heart of the homeland.

SABOTAGE is one of Alfred Hitchcocks earlier efforts and the film was one of the last films that the director made before upping sticks and moving to Hollywood. Its easy to see why America came calling, because SABOTAGE is yet another fine example of the director drawing tension from a relatively simple concept. The fact that the central character owns a cinema lets Alfred Hitchcock play with his passion and unleash tiny homages to the art form that he clearly loves so well.

Oskar Homolka delivers a strong performance as the terrorist, while Sylvia Sydney offers strong support as the wife oblivious to her husbands deadly secret. Youre drawn into the characters here and you invest in them as well as the plot. Thats what makes Alfred Hitchcock such a great director and he litters his film with tiny details. Hes not content with simply ratcheting up the tension and he works at making the world in his films feel tangible and real and this helps draw the audience in when things become emotionally taut. Theyre on-board with him when the plot gets farfetched and at this point they don't care when he takes them over the edge and into the ridiculous.

Oskar Homolka as Verloc is a perfect tool for Hitchcock's deliberate tempo. Miss Sidney as his bewildered wife, tragically mothering her young brother; Master Tester as the boy, John Loder as the romantic sergeant from Scotland Yard and William Dewhurst as the bomb manufacturer are severally perfect. But it is Alfred Hitchcock's picture and a valuable one, for its entire refusal to give us the whys and the wherefores of the sabotage plot. I will not inform you what happens, because that would be to cheat Alfred Hitchcock of his just reward, but it is a warning what you may not expect, which, as are the way of all Alfred Hitchcock melodramas, is the unexpected.

SABOTAGE was widely praised on its release in 1936, although Observer critic C.A. Lejeune was generally a strong supporter of Alfred Hitchcock, complained about the cruelty of the explosion scene, which is perhaps why the director dismissed it years later. Despite the vagueness of its politics, the film was banned in Brazil as a potential threat to public order.

SABOTAGE was Alfred Hitchcock's last film for Gaumont-British Picture Corporation which, at the behest of its financiers the Ostrer brothers, had decided to abandon production and concentrate on distribution. For what would be his last two pictures before relocating to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock signed once again with Gainsborough on a two film contract.

Hollywood did indeed take notice of Alfred Hitchcock. After completing Jamaica Inn in 1939, and Alfred Hitchcock and family emigrated lock, stock and barrel to the USA to make the film Rebecca [1940] for producer David O. Selznick and begin a long and illustrious career in America. However, SABOTAGE was not a major success for the director, partly due to the controversial bus bombing sequence. It was banned outright in Brazil where it was accused by the censors of teaching conspiracy and terrorist techniques. In the USA it was given a title change A Woman Alone but it didn't fare much better with audiences here than in Britain. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, wrote in her book, Alma Hitchcock: The Woman Behind the Man, saying that ""the film was definitely a bit of a downer. Sabotage remains, probably with Vertigo [1958] and Psycho [1960], one of my father's darkest films, where a happy ending was impossible.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Network brings us SABOTAGE in a 1080p Black-and-White image resolution, and sadly we encounter less than pristine HD transfer. The black levels are a touch soft when the light levels drop, and the picture displays the sort of exposure flicker that we once accepted as inevitable on older films before modern digital restoration really made it mark. Dust spots have been minimised, but the odd frame of damage is still visible and the picture jiggles around just a little in the gate. But in other respects this transfer justifies its Blu-ray incarnation, particularly in the level of picture detail, which is far superior to any Standard inferior DVD version you may have seen, and in the daylight scenes the contrast is very well balanced, the tonal range generous and the image itself pleasing. Not perfect, perhaps, but still a solid and impressive job and network should be praised for trying their best to bring as best an image quality with what was available from the original negative. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio track shows its age in the narrowness of the dynamic range and the treble bias, but there are very few signs of damage, the dialogue is always distinct, and there is next to no background hiss or noise.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Introduction by Charles Barr [0000] [1080i] [1.33:1] [3:40] Professor Charles Barr of the School of Art, Media and American Studies at the University of East Anglia provides a brief but interesting overview of Alfred Hitchcock's working relationship with left-wing aristocrat Ivor Montagu, who was instrumental in introducing him to the work of the silent-era Soviet filmmakers, whose influence is clearly visible on this film. Charles Barr sees the scene as evidence of the influence of Soviet montage that Alfred Hitchcocks collaborator Ivor Montagu had introduced him to. But one must add that such cross-cutting was also a feature of DW Griffith and other directors in the silent period (with the famous example of cutting between the speeding train and the heroine tied to the track). The (almost silent) opening shots of a light bulb, a power station, the bulb flickering and going out followed by the sabotage being discovered and finally Karl Verloc walking out of the shadows certainly recalls the Soviet style, although here it is used for a different purpose. Charles Barr also points out the two key scenes in SABOTAGE that help build up the tension in the film that was Alfred Hitchcocks famous trade mark, which made his films so loved by the cinema going public and film critics.

Special Feature: On Location introduced by Robert Powell [2008] [1080i] [1.33:1] [11:06] Robert Powell, who played Richard Hannay in the second remake of Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, takes us on a brief but engaging tour of London locations used in the film SABOTAGE. The first location on Roberts tour is London Zoo and the Aquarium, where you asked if you recognise the famous Carry On film actor that we have a brief glimpse of in the 1936 film. Next on the tour is Trafalgar Square, then we move onto the famous Simpsons in the Strand, where the three characters have a meal. We then have a section called Movie Trivia which Robert Powell explains certain scenes in the film and why Alfred Hitchcock decided to shoot them that way. But finally Robert Powell reveals the Carry On film actor that appeared in a short scene from SABOTAGE and of course Robert reveals it is of course Charles Hawtrey. Now again we get scenes from the film SABOTAGE that Robert Powell shows us on his tour and suppose you could class this as spoilers, so not one for those who have not watched this film.

Special Feature: Image Gallery [1080p] [2:26] Here we get a rolling gallery of Cinema Film Posters, Front-of-House Cinema Lobby Cards that are colorized, we also get to view lots of Black-and-White publicity promotional stills, plus lots of Black-and-White studio photographs, and the majority are of very high quality. Also Included are some very rare behind-the-scenes shot of the Lord Mayor's show that was faked in a field in Norfolk, and one of Alfred Hitchcock and Oscar Homolka in cheerful mood.

BONUS: Here we have a beautiful designed Blu-ray Cover and especially inside where you have on one side displayed two colorized cinema posters for The Woman Alone [USA Release] and one for SABOTAGE [UK Release]. Below that we have six colorized Cinema Lobby Cards for The Woman Alone. On the right hand side you have a Network advert for their Network Film On Air publication, which you can sign up to receive online their weekly newsletter and a free monthly collectable PDF magazine highlighting new releases in the BRITSH FILM range from Network.

Finally, Every Alfred Hitchcock is worth watching but SABOTAGE is a great example of his work as a director without the excess of a Hollywood budget, not that it was ever a bad thing. Its a tense, dramatic thriller that works as well today as it did back when it was released in 1936. Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE was an underrated and too rarely seen film from Alfred Hitchcock's late British period that scores on intrigue and tension, and even from a modern perspective delivers a genuine jolt by breaking a rule that the director otherwise swore by. An Arrow-standard restoration would have been lovely, but despite some visible imperfections, Network's Blu-ray still delivers the goods. It is nice to own Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE on Blu-ray. I found this a very dark exciting film with the child aspect, but Sylvia Sidney is her usual, bright, charming self. This is a very good film. This transfer is far better than previous inferior DVD versions and it will be a film I will definitely want to revisit. Despite any slight age-related image problems, it still worth purchasing and this early Alfred Hitchcock classic thriller has never looked better. Highly Recommended!

His people are ordinary, their actions low key, the City and the City's people are intricately interrelated with the actors, the tension is omnipresent but manifest in the slight gestures, street crowds, omnibuses, pauses, impulsive movement. No moment is wasted, no word unnecessary, no film shot irrelevant. The supporting cast does its job with style, while the leads, excellent always, have never been better. John Loder, never a big name, does well as the police officer on undercover assignment, Oscar Homolka skillfully subdues his presence to fit perfectly the saboteur without ideology, without real understanding of just what he is doing and its consequences, still quite young Sylvia Sidney is anything but a Hollywood Star doing a turn, she is immensely appealing, utterly naively charming, free of grandiloquence. Together directed by Hitchcock, they are superb.
Since, at the moment, there is no plot line given on the Amazon webpage for the film, I'll briefly outline what I can without giving anything away. We know in the first five minutes, that The City, has a major blackout caused by an act of sabotage carried out by a movie theater owner. His wife knows nothing of his activities. Next door to the movie house, is a grocer, one of whose clerks shows a marked interest in the wife. She has a younger brother who helps out doing errands related to the operation of the theater. Early on, we see the saboteur being admonished by the one who pays him, that this last job was inadequate to the purposes for which they were paying him; that something that would strike terror into the heart of The City was required. From there the tension grows exponentially.
Any admirer of Hitchcock's films will have to see this one. Others should find it good entertainment.",1351296000,,1860,4.945686900958466
