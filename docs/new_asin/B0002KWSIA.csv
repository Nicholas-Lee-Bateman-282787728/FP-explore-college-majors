8028701,4,B0002KWSIA,"Thompson Temple guides several hunters in their quest for large bucks.  He educates the viewer about hunting methods and habitat. I find Thompson to be an ethical hunter who respects his quarry at all times.  You won't see unethical behavior at all.  If you enjoy hunting videos, you should strongly consider adding this one to your collection.  This is a DVD that can be enjoyed over and over again.",1280361600,,400,4.753623188405797
8028702,3,B0002KWSIA,"If you are looking for a hunting video this one is alright. It is not that informative. Its not really well-done. No it simply cures the winter itch for some hunting pictures. I guess what I am saying is this: ""It is a basic video, thats not much other than a simple hunting flic.""",1207958400,,281,4.222222222222222
8028703,3,B0002KWSIA,"Among Ken Wilson's Sportsman on Film hunting videos, this video scores the lowest.  While the concept is good, the action and dialog is somewhat lacking in material.  The hunts in the video are pasted together to create  a multi-faceted hunting trip.  Also, the footage at various stages in the  video seems to be out of order and lack in a positive fluid motion.  In  addition, there is very little footage of whitetail deer which were not  being pursued by hunters.  However, the video starts with a good attempt to  share with viewers the characteristics of trophy whitetail management and  hunting.  Mr. Wilson uses one of Texas' best hunting guides, Thompson  Temple.  Thompson Temple as spent most of his life hunting, managing and  guiding private ranches in Texas.  He is also considered to be an expert on  exotic animals.  He was the creator/founder of The Record of Exotics  scoring system.  Mr. Temple has also had many years experience in whitetail  management and provides to viewers a bit of his knowledge on whitetails and  whitetail hunting.  Altough not one of the greatest whitetail hunting  videos I have viewed, this video provides some good hunting action and some  impressive deer that are harvested on film.",947635200,7,1231,4.975247524752476
