5663374,5,B00BPDBEO2,"Unlike now days, we loved westerns for the most part. The Lone Ranger (orriginal with Clayton Moore) had values and you always knew the bad guy from the good guy. Roy Rogers was the same way. Those were the days when you were given a sense of family, the old west, Spanish California, Robin Hood and others. It was a simple time and a good time for families. I don't find much good to watch now days. NO, I am not really that old, either.",1410566400,4,438,4.1647058823529415
5663375,5,B00BPDBEO2,a must have if you like the Lone Ranger.  Makes you wish for those good ole days when these were the most exciting thing on TV,1408752000,,126,3.8461538461538463

5663377,5,B00BPDBEO2,"This was a great addition to my ""Lone Ranger"" collection. I now have a total of 61 different episodes, and the two feature length movies, of the ""Masked Man"". But I know that there should be many more available as the series lasted for 5 or 6 years. I wish someone would release the complete series on DVD like they did with the old Richard Greene  ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" several years ago. Really enjoyed watching them.",1398124800,4,424,4.5064935064935066
5663378,3,B00BPDBEO2,"Although he isn't as popular as he once was, The Lone Ranger remains an icon of American pop culture. Unfortunately, he is an icon that many younger people are only vaguely aware. I was lucky growing up because my parents exposed my siblings and I to all of the tv Westerns and pop culture of their youth, including THE LONE RANGER.

If you are curious about The Lone Ranger, THE LONE RANGER: 28 THRILLING EPISODES DVD is an ok place to start. The set contains four discs that include 28 episodes from Seasons 1 & 2 of THE LONE RANGER tv show. If you've never seen the tv show, this set gives you an idea about what it was like.

Unfortunately, there are a few flaws with this set. For example, although the film quality is excellent, the editing for many episodes is not done in a very good manner (many sudden scene changes, jump cuts, faster ratios for some scenes, etc.). Also, the opening credits are not the original opening credits. I was disappointed by this because, for the most part, I like watching older television shows with their original openings and closings. Finally, as a set of discs that can introduce people to The Lone Ranger, it's disappointing that this set doesn't contain the episode that actually introduces the origins of the character.

THE LONG RANGER: 28 THRILLING EPISODES is a decent DVD collection of some of the first and second season episodes of THE LONG RANGER tv show. For 28 episodes of classic television, it's incredibly inexpensively priced. However, if you're more of a completist, like myself then you will probably be better off with either THE LONE RANGER - 75TH ANNIVERSARY or THE LONE RANGER: COLLECTORS EDITION.",1378944000,7,1662,4.70446735395189
5663379,3,B00BPDBEO2,I'm almost sorry I reopened this chapter from my childhood. These stories just don't hold up over time. The Lone Ranger is not the hero I remembered from childhood.,1373328000,,164,4.689655172413793
5663380,4,B00BPDBEO2,"I don't know why companies can't release a complete series at a good price.
Seasons 1&2 have been released from classic media.
Where are seasons three, four, and five.
I hope the complete series set will be reduced in price.
The new movie will be in theatres on July 3, 2013.
PLEASE RELEASE THE LONE RANGER SEASONS 3, 4, 5 BEFORE THE END OF TIME.",1372118400,6,346,4.338461538461538
5663381,4,B00BPDBEO2,"If you are curious, this is simply discs 2,4,6 and 7 from the previously released box set and all from season one.  This is a terrific sampling from the first season and a great and inexpensive way to sample the beginning of the legend. Of course it would  have been better if they included disc 1 with the actual beginning of the Lone Ranger story. A MUCH better deal (now around $20) is this set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lone-Ranger-75th-Anniversary-Seasons-1-and-2/dp/B001DJ7Q0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lone Ranger: 75th Anniversary - Seasons 1 and 2</a>&nbsp;for about twice the investment you get 78 episodes instead of only 28 and all kinds of wonderful extras.
