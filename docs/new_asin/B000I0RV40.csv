2650943,5,B000I0RV40,This movie is really good. Cute and not overly silly. I like it that the main actor's lives don't turn out the way they want all the time. Makes it more realistic...kind of. Abhishek and Rani are a great pair. The soundtrack is also great.,1217116800,2,239,4.333333333333333
2650944,5,B000I0RV40,"I think this movie was part ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and part ""Catch Me If You Can"". The story was pure fantasy, but totally engaging and fun. The songs were catchy, and I find myself humming the tunes even a couple of weeks after watching the movie. There is also a cameo (song) by Aishwarya Rai (best song of the movie) to look forward to. Great fun!",1190851200,5,344,4.2272727272727275
2650945,5,B000I0RV40,"Bunty Aur Babli (Bunty And Babli) are the Bollywood equivalent of Bonnie and Clyde.  Both misunderstood by their families, and longing for more from life, Rakesh and Vimmi each leave home to follow their dreams.  Fate or circumstance brings them together.  Closed doors and corrupt dealings keep them together.  Frustrated after a bank manager steals his get rich scheme, Rakesh devises a plan to con the con man.  On the run, Rakesh and Vimmi become Bunty and Babli.  Thus begins an adventure that leads them from Lucknow to Delhi with many stops in between.

 The evolving relationship between the two main characters is enchanting, despite the nefarious nature of their partnership.  Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee have a wonderful chemistry as the engaging criminal couple.  Their characters are well developed, allowing the viewer to see beyond their unlawful behavior, to the warm-hearted souls that they truly are.  Bunty and Babli charm everyone they meet, including Deputy Commissioner of Police, Dashrath Singh (played by Amitabh Bachchan).  The film has elements of Catch Me if You Can, as DCP Singh tries to track them.

 Bunty repeats the aphorism ""Yeh world hai na world... Isme do tarah ke log hotey hai... (This world has two kinds of people . . . ) several times throughout the film.  It seems to have become almost a philosophy for him, in an effort, perhaps to make sense of a world that doesn't seem to understand him.

 I was drawn to this film after watching one of the musical numbers on You Tube.  Kajra Re is pure Bollywood song and dance, and the special appearance by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is the icing on the cake.  The songs in the film are captivating and memorable, and the incongruous sight of Amitabh Bachchan rapping during the end credits was a delightful end to the experience.  One of the most delightful and characteristic aspects of Bollywood films is the way in which the musical numbers can transport the characters into totally different settings, as a means to portray a particular emotion or event.

 As with most Bollywood films, it is quite long, at 170 minutes.  With non-stop action and song-and-dance numbers, I hardly noticed the time passing.  If you've never seen a Bollywood film, this one would be a great introduction.

 The one issue I had was the tendency of the subtitles to flash by too quickly, near the beginning of the film.  As the action began, this was much less of an issue, and did not detract from the enjoyability of the film.",1173657600,13,2506,4.8352941176470585

2650954,4,B000I0RV40,"Revisiting BUNTY AUR BABLI. I haven't seen this fun Hindi film in eons, and it's definitely grown on me with repeated viewings. BUNTY AUR BABLI clocks in heftily at around two and a half hours long, which is the typical length of a Bollywood picture. When I first saw this years ago, I remember liking it but not liking it as much as KUCH NAA KAHO or DHAAI AKSHAR PREM KE, two other films which featured Abhishek Bachchan. But BUNTY AUR BABLI, I guess, ages like fine wine.

So, the plot: Rakesh (Abhishek Bachchan) is a young man determined to escape his humdrum, small-city life. He opts to leave home when given an ultimatum by his father to either show up in a job interview or to get lost. Rakesh, you see, has come up with the perfect business scheme which he believes will propel him to immediate financial success. Meet also Vimmi (Rani Mukerji) who wants more of life than to become a typical arranged bride and so runs away to pursue her dream of becoming Miss India. Both of these young hopefuls' plans go awry. Then they meet and Rakesh and Vimmi transform into Bunty and Babli, scammers extraordinaire, bilking people of their riches and then sharing the wealth with the poor and downtrodden. Halfway thru the film Dashrath Singh strides in, a bulldog of a policeman played in full taciturn glory by iconic actor (and Abhishek's father) Amitabh Bachchan. The remainder of the film chronicles DCP Singh's frustrated attempts to nab the carefree criminals, Bunty and Babli, who had by then become modern day legends.

Nowadays Abhishek tends to go with the bearded look, so it's a bit jarring to eyeball him here all whisker-free. He takes on his role with good humor, but I tend to be on sure footing when Abhishek is starring in a film. He's an entertaining cat. BUNTY AUR BABLI was when I first saw Amitabh Bachchan, who is large in India, and I thought he was okay. It wasn't until I saw KHAKEE that I finally got what the icon status was all about. Rani Mukerji is cute, although her character's occasional (and unconvincing) weeping may grate on the nerves. Incidentally, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this may have been the first movie that both the Bachchan men have been in.

So, this is Bollywood where song & dance are alive and well and pop up with unexpected frequency. There are two musical numbers to anticipate. One (""B & B"") takes place in the closing credits, with an MTV-like video of the elder Bachchan portraying his policeman character rapping/lipsynching in English - it cracked me up. The other one is the penultimate number, ""Kajra Re"" (Night Eyes), a gem of a specialty item featuring Aishwarya Rai, wherein she engages the two Bachchans in a smoking dancefest - very cool, with Aish very hot. To be utterly honest, back in 2006, Ms. Rai (now Mrs. Bachchan) was the main reason I purchased this movie. Yup indeedy, her one guest musical performance now elevates my eval of this flick to 4 out of 5 stars. When I first saw this film back in the middle oughts, my rating was a bit lower. As mentioned, repeated viewings have made me reevaluate. I've gotten fonder of the film.

To sum up, BUNTY AUR BABLI is a diverting watch. It has no airs about it. It just wants to entertain its audience. It knows what it is and cheerfully hams it up to the hilt. It won't challenge your mind, but it may make a run at your heartstrings. It won't make you fall into a deep reverie, but you may grin at the sheer goofiness and escapism of the story. If you've got nothing better to do one evening, pop this musical-comedy DVD in and take a load off. Suspend disbelief as hard as you can and be gentle on the actors. They're all better than this movie, and this movie's not at all bad.",1328313600,,3713,4.520833333333333
2650955,3,B000I0RV40,"BUNTY AUR BABLI is a fun movie. For American viewers it's BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE Meets BONNIE AND CLYDE. Bunty (the guy) and Babli (the girl) are both so good natured and so good looking that it's hard to remember that they're grifters.

Actually, they aren't. They're just two kids from small towns looking to escape the family business (Bunty) and a traditional arranged marriage (Babli). They run off (separately), meet, and begin a long string of criminal misadventures, mostly defrauding obnoxious rich people, all the while having a blast.

The film is seemingly endless, and presents us with (at least) one of everything onscreen, including the kitchen sink. Flashy dance club routines break up the action, characters come and go in profusion, the storyline wanders more than an Indian mendicant on his way to Varanasi, and somewhere inside the third hour of the film the typical American viewer comes to realize that Bollywood loves colorful excess and pretty people.  Not too different from Hollywood, really.",1282348800,4,1030,5.155688622754491
2650956,4,B000I0RV40,"Bunty Aur Babli was a movie I bought on a whim because it appeared as a suggestion based on other films I bought, and I'm glad i did. This is a movie that just makes you smile and laugh all the way through. It is light on plot in the first half, then introduces more serious moments in the second half, which surprisingly work perfect for the story. The tone is upbeat, the music is fun, and the story is a hilarious take on a Bonnie and Clyde kind of couple. Its a Bollywood film that proves that formula can work with the right stars, script, and music. If you like romantic comedies this is a great pick.",1281484800,,607,4.1525423728813555
2650957,5,B000I0RV40,"On the heels of their award-winning performances as an abusive thug and his suffering wife in Yuva (2004), Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji are paired again, this time, in lighter fare--the romantic comedy Bunty Aur Babli--playing a hen-pecked con artist and his vivacious partner in crime--and their delivery is just as strong.

Amitabh Bachchan appears with his son Abhishek for the first time in this film--and they went on to memorable onscreen collaborations in Sarkar (2005), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Sarkar Raj (2008), and Paa (2009). Here, the senior Bachchan--a jack of all genres--plays Dashrath, a cool, crusty police detective, and he hams it up to the fullest in bomber jacket and aviator sunglasses while hot on the trail of two notorious small-town kids on a crime spree. His interaction with his son's character, Rakesh, is a riot.

Director Shaad Ali's previous film Saathiya (2002), which also starred Mukerji, was a serious story also about impulsive young lovers who strike out on their own, and here again, Ali creates vivid working-class characters, and his signature metaphor of train travel figures largely.

Rakesh meets Vimmi (Mukerji) in a train station after both have run away from home. They're dreamers who want more out of life than their parents imagine for them, and they're frustrated with the limitations of their upbringings. Believing they're destined for bigger and better things--Vimmi wants to be Miss India and Rakesh has a business idea--and delighted to discover a kindred spirit, they hit the road together. When their plans are a bust, they start scamming for money--and they have so much fun doing it, they don't want to stop. They hilariously impersonate government officials, spiritual gurus, gangsters, and business partners to trick people into giving them free meals, hotel rooms, cars, and cash. They adopt the names Bunty and Babli and leave their initials at every crime scene as they crisscross North India at a frenetic pace and gain fame as a crime duo. Finally, they're successful and important, as they always hoped to be.

While they start out as pals, it's inevitable that this reckless, passionate couple fall in love. After all, they argued like an old married couple from day one--so they make it official. But once hitched, everything changes. Suddenly, Vimmi has different priorities, and they have to find a way to be true to themselves while taking responsibility for each other. But that's not an easy thing to do with Dashrath always one step behind them.

2650958,5,B000I0RV40,The Songs were the best part of the movie.  Overall a good look into the different mentality of movies and life in general in that region of the world.  The english CC was close to what was really said but some of the translations were funnier.,1267574400,,244,4.282608695652174
2650959,5,B000I0RV40,"This movie and a couple of other ""Bollywood"" movies that I bought at the same time have completely turned me around on this genre of film. There are 2 big time song and dance productions in Bunty Aur Babli that are stunning. Nach Baliye explodes on the screen with incredible energy that manages to build during the performance. Kajra Re begins softly and quaint and builds to an almost furious pace that is rooted in tradition and spectacular in design. The musical score, choreography, cinematography and performances by all of the actors and dancers are first rate. The rest of the music in the film isn't half bad either, not to mention the story that is thrown in.

Rani Mukerjee is wonderful as Babli. There is a scene where she cries like Lucille Ball ala I Love Lucy where it actually adds to the scene.",1241827200,,811,4.593103448275862

That first portion sets up their back stories, yet really drags on until they commit their first con job and then things move and entertain.

These three are the three of my five favorite Indian actors and are wonderfully entertaining in their films. Once Dad Bachchan shows up as the cop who is determined to bring them down the heat rises.",1463011200,,525,4.515789473684211
