2993394,5,B000X07SQ6,I bought this dvd collection of wonderwoman for my son who has been a fan since he was four years old. He cleaned my whole house for me as a thank you gift because he was so greatful for his gift. I highly recomend this collection for any fan of any age.,1242604800,22,254,3.9038461538461537
2993395,3,B000X07SQ6,"I don't see why Warner Bros. felt a need to have to make a complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN during these tough economic times.

So I'm wondering if this is just another gimmick that Warner Bros. to try to make extra money to try to squeeze our hard earned cash during all these budget cuts going on right now or is Warner Bros. trying to compensate for all the flaws that they had in some of the WONDER WOMAN DVD box sets that were shown inadequeately.

Perhaps Warner Bros. got the idea to make a WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set from Universal since Universal had released a complete series DVD box set of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, and MIAMI VICE last year(2008)in order for Warner Bros. to compete with Universal, despite this stinkin recession were in right now.

However, I suspect that this complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN is no better and is probably no more siginificant than the first 3 individual season box sets of WONDER WOMAN for that matter either, unless of course this DVD box set may have a bonus material episode telling us both the producers and Lynda Carter's experience while filming WONDER WOMAN in the 1970's and what led to its cancellation on CBS and all, kind of like the bonus features on the last 3 seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK DVD's did, especially on THE INCREDIBLE HULK-SEASON 5 DVD when creator(Ken Johnson)explained how and why CBS had ended up cancelling THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden back in November of 1981 in the middle of its Fifth Season, due to budget cuts & controversy at CBS.

Therefore when CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK back in the mid Fall of 1981; it was quite similar to when CBS had abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in September of 1979 since I was under the impression that WONDER WOMAN was starting a 4th Season when the last 2 episodes ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" and ""Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" were shown on their original air-dates on CBS for the very first time, but I was wrong since CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN in mid September of 1979, which was perhaps due to a big slump in ratings, unlike the case with THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

As a matter of fact, THE INCREDIBLE HULK had better ratings than WONDER WOMAN did and had even lasted longer than WONDER WOMAN did too even though CBS had unfortunately cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK 2 years later after CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN since the special-effects on THE INCREDIBLE HULK got too expensive due to budget cuts from the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president along with the fact that various people felt that the Hulk was running out of steam on top of that even though the ratings on THE INCREDIBLE HULK were still high enough to last another season.

Anyway since Warner Bros. has made this WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set like Universal has made a THE INCREDIBLE HULK: THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set; this box set takes me all the way back to memory lane when both WONDER WOMAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK were part of CBS's Friday night line-up back in 1978 and 1979 when WONDER WOMAN was on every Friday night at 8PM followed by THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM.

In addition something else I noticed about both WONDER WOMAN & THE INCREDIBLE HULK was I noticed that a lot of the people who guest starred on WONDER WOMAN had also later guest starred on THE INCREDIBLE HULK too like Albert Popwell, Peter-Mark Richman(SANTA BARBARA), Jared Martin(DALLAS), Saundra Sharp, Taaffe O'Connell, Rick Springfield(GENERAL HOSPITAL), Henry Darrow(SANTA BARBARA), Al White, Denny Miller, Art Metrano, Bradford Dillman, John Reilly(ALL MY CHILDREN), Michael Baseleon, Nicholas Coster(AS THE WORLD TURNS), Frank Marth, George Caldwell, Christine Belford, Richard Narita, Frank Doubleday, Dick O'Neill, Ron Lombard, David White, Charlie Brill(SILK STALKINGS), etc.",1239753600,2,3882,4.811094452773613

2993397,5,B000X07SQ6,"What can I say, you get all 3 seasons here for a Wonderful price. The quality is fantastic in this series & the bonus features are pretty good as well. Lynda Carter has given the Wonder Woman comic book hero life in all 3 seasons. Her acting can not be touched for this series, there is an innocence about Wonder Woman that Lynda Carter had clearly portrayed in this series. Lynda was clearly born to portray this beautiful, smart & compassionate super hero, she has done this super hero justice. Season 1 is the best in the series dealing with the war of the Nazis, many of my favorite episodes are within season 1. Seasons 2 & 3 are just as good but the war is not over,.. technology & man create havoc for the young princess Diana making each episode a joy to watch. You can't go wrong with this complete set, makes a great gift for the super hero fan or any Wonder Woman fan. You've done well Lynda in giving us fantastic memories of a Wonderful series that will live an eternity!

2993401,3,B000X07SQ6,"I bought these when my son told me that girls could not be super heros.  My Daughter loves them and my son now knows that women can be super heros too.  Added benefit is that first season takes place during World War 2.  My kids are asking me so many questions about what that was all about.

Really cheesey series but lots of fun.

Kick ASS wonder woman .... I love it.. Only issues is wonder woman deserves love why could she not join that space man with the 7 moons on at least a weekend lover affair? They could get sexy get a few space drinks enjoy an adventure?  After all the crime is was fighting I mean a gal deserved some loving...Oh and that goodness for the heterosexual relationships.. NO judgment but I am straight I love to see Heterosexual relationship too.

She's awesome, entertaining, gorgeous, and is everything classic Wonder Woman is, but quite honestly, the show itself is actually horribly made and poorly produced. Poor acting, lame stunts, stagnant stories, and extremely dated. The only way anyone can enjoy this show is for the childhood nostalgic element. Classic television camp at best. Pop culture legend. That's it. I only watch this show for Lynda Carter, wading through the dry idlistic villians and obscure co-stars. Nothing more.",1505606400,,578,5.362637362637362

2993453,5,B000X07SQ6,"This is a review of the 2016 UK Region 2 Wonder Woman TV series The Complete Collection. It is on 21 single-sided dual-layer discs in a very compact paper box set. The first season has 5 discs and season 2 and 3 have 8 discs each. Each season's discs are in their own colorful glossy foldout cardboard slotted inserts with episode descriptions printed on them. The discs play fine in my multi-region DVD player. The shows appear to be complete. They are not HD but picture and sound are clear and music appears to be intact. I would choose this set over the old 2005 US region 1 set which were on 11 double-sided double-layered discs and prone to many playback problems. The newer 2017 US region 1 repackaged box set is on single-sided dual-layer discs but are highly compressed and also has many playback problems. The only problem I see with this Region 2 set is that on the back of the box it says ""59 episodes plus the pilot movie on 11 discs"". This is wrong because there are ""59 episodes plus the pilot movie on 21 discs."" This must be a misprint for the Region 2 release. Again you must have a multi-region player to view this set.",1502150400,3,1138,4.398104265402844
2993454,1,B000X07SQ6,"This review will not focus on the merits of this enduring TV series since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy it on DVD. Rather, this review will focus on the botched DVD releases that have plagued this classic show.

The picture was in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio while the audio was in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo, with the sets housed in fold-out digipak cases.  While there was no digital re-mastering done, the series still looked better than it had ever looked before.  Unfortunately, bonus features were paltry but more tragically, the series was released on double-sided discs, which were easily prone to fingerprints, scratches, other other issues that could easily affect playback.  In 2007, WB released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000X07SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman: The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set, which simply repackaged the exact same discs, but this time in an outer cardboard sleeve to house the individual season sets.  There were 11 discs total spanning all 3 seasons of 59 episodes plus the pilot movie.

In 2017, WB re-issued&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B06XT497R9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B06XT5KNCZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-3/dp/B06XT7FP45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 3</a>, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B06XT5T1GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;on DVD.  This time, however, the episodes were on single-sided discs housed in hard plastic Amaray cases, which were the same size as standard DVD cases.  While this appeared to finally rectify the flaws of the previous releases, upon further inspection, this was hardly the case.  The disc count for the series remained the same, meaning all 59 episodes at 45 minutes each, plus the 90 minute pilot movie are compressed onto just 11 singe-sided discs!  The result is horrible picture quality that looks heavily pixelated, with roughly half the visual details of the original DVD releases.  This is truly a shame since WB finally had the chance to give this series the proper DVD treatment that it deserved.  For fans, getting this series on DVD means choosing the lesser of two evils.  This reviewer begrudgingly recommends buying the original 2005 releases, as the picture and sound quality are vastly superior to the 2017 releases.  But again, one has to inspect them carefully for any playback issues.

Overall, the Lynda Carter Wonder Woman TV series has yet to receive an exemplary home video release truly befitting the legacy of such a pop cultural phenomenon.  For those who own the previous DVD releases, there is no reason to upgrade to the 2017 releases given the heavily compressed look of the episodes.  With the overwhelming success of the 2017&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman/dp/B0714QRG4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman </a>&nbsp;movie, one can only hope that WB feels compelled to once again revisit this classic series on home video, perhaps on blu-ray.",1501718400,23,3920,7.375536480686695

Having played a few discs of this series, they do indeed freeze and skip very frequently. I will be returning this boxset soon. It should be no surprise these dvds are junk bc they are duel discs, a few episodes on one side, flip the disc, a few more episodes on the other side. This box was produced in 2007 very cheaply so that's why it skips.
The show itself is very dated and cheesy but fun none the less. If they ever sell it on Blu-ray and do it properly I will buy it again.

It's been well worth it. It's a better value than digital downloads, and slipping the DVD in my laptop is practically the same as pulling up a download anyway. The series brings tons of joy with its campy fun! It still remains grounded in the Wonder Woman mythos of violence only when necessary, but there is some violence and it's always fun to see Diana Prince kick some butt. The Gal Gadot/Patty Jenkins movie just came out, and anyone looking for more Diana/Steve interaction is sure to be pleased with the series! There's definitely more of a delicate vibe in the series versus the new movie, but the underlying electric current of Diana's personality is still there.",1500854400,3,848,4.5855263157894735

It had the same symptoms described in several other one-star reviews.  I returned the set and exchanged it for the one remaining set and the exact same problems occurred with disc one of season two.  It's frustrating, of course, but also disappointing.  It appears to be a quality control/manufacturing issue and I'll be returning this set as well for store credit.  If you choose to take a chance and order this set (and likely the individual sets as well) consider yourself warned!  Shame too, because the set is really nicely done:  sturdy, reflective packaging with a nice mix of comic and real-life photos, special features and the fact that it's complete.  Reviews are saying things like ""some discs don't play but the show is great"" and giving it five stars.  The quality of the content (the episodes) may be great but the media they're presented on are defective which renders the set useless!  Perhaps the series will get a proper release on blue ray in the future.

I'm complaining about yet another company cheaping out to the extreme on DVD products.  It's nice to see shows I remember from long ago being released on modern media, but it's such a major disappointment when companies choose to use the worst possible way of producing the media -- double-sided-double-layer DVDs.  I'd probably prefer VHS -- at least those played.

I had not purchased an all-double-sided-double-layer DVD set since ADV's miserable pressing of Andromeda.  I was astonished to see how much worse things are now.  Like Andromeda, the outer layer of each side (usually one or two episodes) plays as well as one can expect from a cheap production run, and the inner layer suffers problems.

Unlike Andromeda, which was subject to skipping and stuttering on the inner layer, this pressing of Wonder Woman is a disaster.  Two of my DVD players will not recognise the discs at all -- giving a 'NO DISC' indication after spending minutes trying to read them; one other DVD player can read the outer layer but on switching to the inner layer stalls for a minute or so then says 'NO DISC'.  Three BD players act the same as the third DVD player, able to play the outer layer on each side but as soon as they try to read the inner layer they either say 'NO DISC' or skip large swaths of the show after long stalls (for example, season 1 episode 2 time to run is randomly somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes, but only about 2 or 3 minutes of that is actually playing parts of the episode, with the player spending the rest of it trying to read the disc).

If they had bothered to do a decent production run of this, I think it would have been good.  The video and audio (that I could play) seem reasonably clean and clear, and the discs were packaged in a case that would reasonably be expected to protect them instead of those stupid paper bags or slick boxes that seem to be the production tendency lately.

I would have happily paid a little more for a decent production run of this.  Although doing this would have slightly reduced the studio's profits, I think it would have sharply reduced returns and defects.  It took several tries (and selecting individual discs out of multiple boxes) to get a couple seasons of Andromeda that would play.  From what I see here, I wonder whether there would be a single fully playable set of this in existence.

Maybe someone will produce this in BD form one day, and hopefully they won't try to violate standards and do a quad-layer-double-sided BD to try to pack the entire season onto a single disc.",1485993600,20,2734,4.524390243902439

It does this on two DVD players, one of which is known to be able to play ""anything"".  I was lucky the errors were on the first disc--it could have had errors only on a disc in the third season: I would not realize it until Amazon's window for returns closed.  I am returning that first collection, but ordered a second as a replacement.  It, too, had errors on the first disc (second side), but not at the same exact locations on the disc.

2993976,3,B000X07SQ6,"Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic superheroines in comic book history, so much so in fact, it's hard to believe she has only one television series on her CV.  But here it is: the Complete Collection, which gathers all 60 episodes of the Wonder Woman series together in one attractive package.  Season One includes the original pilot plus 11 other episodes produced for ABC between 1975-76, and was set in the World War II era.  Season Two features the ""relaunch"" pilot, moving Wonder Woman to the contemporary era (1977) and also representing a change in networks, with the show switching to CBS.  Season Three keeps the action going, though the focus shifts to more teenager-oriented theme and becomes more oriented on Wonder Woman's alter ego, Diana Prince.

The pilot and the Season Three premier (""One Of Our Teenage Idols Is Missing"") feature commentary by Lynda Carter, who played the title role.  There are also short documentaries included in each Season package.  The picture quality is excellent; it's as if the shows were just broadcast yesterday.  Except for a few small edits--the opening credits for the pilot have been changed to those for the standard Season One intro, for instance--the episodes are show as they were originally presented.

If nothing else, Wonder Woman: The Complete Collection proves the old saying that ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""  Taken pound for pound, this is actually a subpar series.  The scripts are only average at best, the stories don't generate much tension, and most of the villains are stale cardboard cut-outs of each other.  Yet despite all the problems, Wonder Woman still comes across as an enjoyable show, primarily due to one factor: Lynda Carter.  Much has been made about how perfect Carter was for the role, both in physical attractiveness and the degree of humanity she brought to the part--and Carter deserves every word of that praise, and then some.  Modern-day actresses scoff at the idea of running around fighting crime in such a scanty costume; Carter not only made it believable, but even perfectly normal.  Her approach to playing Wonder Woman as a ""normal woman, only with super-powers"" was a masterstroke that kept the character fresh, dynamic, and a treat to watch even if the proceedings going on around her grew rather tedious.

Season One, despite its shorter length, actually has the best episodes.  The pilot and the first two regular episodes are the only ones using plotlines drawn directly from the source material, featuring villains from the comic book series; perhaps not surprisingly, these are the three best episodes of the entire series.  Season One also features an up-and-coming actress named Debra Winger as Wonder Girl; the three episodes she appears in are also quite magical.  Seasons Two and Three are more of a mixed bag.  While Carter herself has gone on record saying she preferred working on the series after it moved to the contemporary era, a lot of the magic which permeated the show during Season One began to dissipate throughout Season Two, and by the time Season Three started the show was running on fumes.

Having said that, though, there are a few standout moments during the 1970s era of the show, particularly the episode ""The Man Who Could Move The World,"" where Wonder Woman has to face a Japanese survivor from the US internment camps, who blames her for the death of his brother three decades earlier.  The subject of the US interning innocent Japanese-Americans during World War Ii remains a sensitive one to this day, and it was a bold move of the series to confront it.  Had there been more episodes like this one, the series might very well have run even longer.

Wonder Woman: The Complete Series may not be television at its finest, yet it does have Lynda Carter.  And as unlikely as it sounds, that really is enough reason to give this show a look.  In her remarkable red-white-and-blue costume, proud and confident yet also compassionate and caring, Carter set the gold standard for how super-heroines should be portrayed.  For that, both Carter--and the Wonder Woman series she anchored--deserves its place in history.",1419984000,15,4167,4.932664756446991

2994228,4,B000X07SQ6,"I just started watching this show on tv in the past year, so I apologize if I am trampling on anyone's warm and fuzzy memories from the 70's, (I was a child in the 70's myself) but if not for Lynda Carter's excellent performances, this show would have fizzled out long before it did. My problem with this show is that some of the plots are very weak and hokey, the sound effects are awful, (such as when she jumps) and as for the special effects: I think they did a better job on the Batman show, which was done a decade earlier.

Now that I've said all that, and infuriated the hardcore WW fans, I will say that I enjoyed the first season set in WWII, and again, Lynda Carter is great in the role. She always looks sincere, and looks like she's giving it her all, even when burdened by a ridiculous plot and awful effects. I wanted to give this series 3 stars, but just because of Lynda I put another star on there to make it 4 stars. If you are a devoted fan of the Wonder Woman character, or you have warm memories of watching this in the 70's, this dvd set is well worth picking up.",1407110400,,1086,4.122641509433962

I couldn't wait to find this series in a special boxed edition & when it went on sale, I had to purchase it immediately!  This could have only been better if it would have been made available in BluRay!!  Or if Lynda Carter actually came with the set!  The DVDs play amazing & the clarity is well done.  I recommend this set to anyone who really likes these older shows; I have Charlie's Angels, too.

Just remember one thing, Lynda Carter is the only person to EVER play Wonder Woman.  There have been how many different people play Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Green Lantern, The Hulk, etc. I don't think anyone could ever replace her in the role she played on TV.  And These were real ""TV Prime Time Shows"" W/O FOUL LANGUAGE, SEX, OR MAJOR VIOLENCE!

2994254,5,B000X07SQ6,"Wow! What a wonderful DVD set. I am so happy to have Wonder Woman back on my TV. And this time, my children are even watching with me. I have missed the days of watching WW and now it is at the ease of my fingertips.

Price:

Years ago I looked at treating myself to just one season. It would have been way too expensive. However, with this set, you couldn't ask for more. All  three seasons are here in this set and it is well worth the money. It includes all the wonderful episodes and bonus material. One season alone at Wal-Mart was almost $40, here you get all three for the same price.

Quality:

For having been originally filmed in the late 70s, the shows are of amazing quality. I have not had any issues with any of the DVDs. The DVDs probably even have a better quality than the original episodes airing on TV did. I am very pleased with the clarity. My box set also arrived with no damage. None of my corners were dented, there were no dings in my box set,  no scratches to the outside, and each season was snug inside the boxed holder.

Ease of use:

Now you would think with a DVD how could you go wrong, right? This is where I have the only issue. None of the disks are numbered, nor do they state which side is A and which is B. This proved a fun adventure when my son took the disks out trying to ""help"" me and they were all mixed up. So, while the DVDs themselves are easy to use, it would be easier if you could simply look at them and know what order they go in. I recommend finding a way to number them if possible.

Graphics:

Remember, these were originally filmed in the 70s and the story lines (who are we kidding) are kind of cheesy, but for back then, and EVERYTHING Wonder Woman could do, the graphics are great. Seeing Wonder Woman use her Lasso of Truth, spin out of her civilian outfit, or bend bars, was pretty high tech. Plus, the box the set came in, had some pretty sweet raised texture graphics. I'm happy.

Journey back in time:

If you were, or are a Wonder Woman fan you simply cant ask for anything better than the original TV series in full! Lynda Carter and Lyle Waggoner will win you over just like it was yesterday. I found myself rooting for the same outcomes I did years ago and enjoying the same smiles I had as a kid. This series easily transports you back in time where ""All our hopes are pinned on you. And the magic that you do. You're a wonder, Wonder Woman!""

This is truly a gift for the Wonder Woman fanand a Wonder Woman blanket to get cozy on the couch and watch episode after episode.",1399334400,28,2542,4.173824130879345

One of the best investments you can ever make! At the beginning I was afraid of buying it because I have a Blu-ray player and DVDs don't look very good on it despite their conversion system and HD TVs only display excellent image from HD sources. Well, even though it's DVD technology the image on my Blu-ray is just as WONDERFUL as Wonder Woman! I just have to say the image quality is mind blowing! It looks like a 4:3 Blu-ray adaptation. Only one of the discs in season two was faulty as the Blu-ray player didn't read it and neither could my laptop computer. However my old computer red it perfectly. Season 1 is absolutely priceless! Maybe something bad is the sound as it is monophonic, but that's how it was originally made for TV in the 70s! The saying ""it's the whole package"" literally applies here since the packaging makes justice to the content, the design of the boxes and the graphic design inside them is to die for! For any comic lover, especially those that grew in the 70s or 80s, it's a MUST have!",1394409600,7,1160,4.425233644859813

2994308,5,B000X07SQ6,"I grew up watching these on TV.  They were silly then, and even sillier now.  However, they have such a sense of fun and adventure to the episodes it's difficult not to smile.  These are clean, so you can watch with family and lack most of the nihilism present in modern television.  While I enjoy the modern sci/fi, super heroes, etc. for the most part, they are markedly dark in tone.  I don't come away with a sense of dread after watching something like this.

Lynda Carter never misses a beat and always seems to play her character seriously no matter how ridiculous the script.  Debrah Winger also surprised me, as Wonder Woman's inexperienced and far less effective sister.  I didn't remember her having a sister in show [it was a long time ago], so it was a fun cameo [before she was a movie actress].  I haven't gotten past the first season yet, which has so far all been based on WWII and thwarting enemy agents and schemes.  I'm looking forward to further seasons and the scenarios they bring, as I believe they are set in the show's ""present"" times [late 1970's].",1391385600,5,1075,4.523316062176166

I've bought the dvds out of nostalgia and it was fun to revisit the  characters (e.g. the neurotic queen of the amazons (at least in the early episodes), the hilarious nazi officials and spies and a very young Debra Winger (dressed like Polyanna) as WW younger sister aka Wonder Girl; the special FX are awful but representative of that timeframe and it is somehow embarassing to admit that like them as they are . Silly plots (even back then) but who really cared/cares? So much for suspension of disbelief. Cheesy 1970's show? Perhaps, but this one delivers quite a few cherished memories.  The image and sound qualities are great and the package itself is a pop culture piece worth keeping. The original Brazilian Portuguese dubbing  (as I remember it) sure added charisma to the show's characters (the actor's real voices were somehow disappointing), but, unfortunately, it is not available as in the case of the Hart to Hart dvd collection.

After the failed attempt with Cathy Lee Crosby in the fist tv pilot.  Not her fault who ever was developing this was just asleep did not care or had no idea or was on drugs.

Then ABC came out with The new Original Wonder Woman and WOW OH GOSH YES YES YES. Linda Carter who will always be that character in my eyes was just perfect she was Wonder Woman made flesh.

Stunning in beauty and made us believe like christopher reeves that super heros are real.

For those of us who loved the show and want to pass it on to our daughters nieces or daughters of friends this is the tv show to have after all little girls need heros to.

2994484,4,B000X07SQ6,"William Moulton Marston's super-empowered Superheroine comes to vibrant life in this ""blast from the past"" 1976-1979 series. The series shares some of the same ""high camp"" sensibilities as ""Batman"" (1966-1968). But ""Wonder Woman"" holds up much better than ""Batman."" Lynda Carter is the perfect embodiment of the comic book Superheroine, and she portrays her with a captivating sincerity. Like Christopher Reeve as ""Superman"", Lynda Carter plays Wonder Woman as the friend you always wish you had. Carter believes in the feminist message of Wonder Woman and the importance of her mission. She delivers the important Season 1 lines, ""a society that does not respect the power of women is doomed to failure"" with strong conviction.
  Season 1 is extremely faithful to Wonder Woman's comic book orgins, and is set during World War II.  Amazon Princess Diana discovers the dishy Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner from ""The Carol Burnett Show"") after he crash-lands on her mystical home of Paradise Island. After he is nursed back to health, Diana returns with him to America (as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman) to help in the battle against the Nazis. Debra Winger makes a rather inauspicious professional debut as Diana's younger sister Drucilla (A.K.A. ""Wonder Girl."") Wonder Girl is definitely ""Blunder Girl"" when she accidentally gives away the secret location of Paradise Island, which is quickly invaded by Nazis, in the episodes ""The Feminum Mystique, Parts I and II.""
  Season 1 has a rather innocent charm. But producers wisely realized that the series would not survive if Wonder Woman continued fighting Nazis forever. When the Series switched from ABC to CBS for Seasons 2 and 3, the series zoomed forward in time to ""present day"" 1977-1979.  Ageless  Diana/Wonder Woman returns to America to work at the Inter-Agency Defense Command (The ""I.A.D.C.) with Steve Trevor, Jr. Lyle Waggoner returns as the son of the character he portrayed in Season 1. Producer Douglas S. Cramer decided to extinquish any romantic sparks between Diana and Steve. Steve became Diana's boss at the I.A.D.C. and their relationship remained platonic.  Wonder Woman wasn't quite finished fighting Nazis. A mad scientist creates a clone of Hitler in the episode ""Anschuluss '77."" Other ghosts, and a terrible misunderstanding, from World War II are confronted in the episode ""The Man Who Could Move The World.'
  Diana/Wonder Woman often went off on exciting missions on her own, fighting mad scientists, a manicial magician, a demented toymaker, a disembodied brain, and several alien terrorists from outer space (""Mind Stealers From Outer Space, Part I and II"" and ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret, Part I and II"")!
Memorable guest stars include John Saxon,  Cloris Leachman, Fannie Flagg, Carolyn Jones, Beatrice Straight,  Robert Reed and Eve Plumb (both from ""The Brady Bunch""), Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development""), Roddy McDowall, Dack Rambo (""All My Children""),  Rick Springfield  (""General Hospital""),  Henry Gibson (""Laugh-In""). ""Mary Poppins"" co-stars Hermione Baddeley and Arthur Malet, Ed Bagley, Jr. and ""Knots Landing"" co-stars Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackleford.
  All 60  episodes are collected here on 11 double-sided DVDS, in an attractive, comic book design Box Set, offered by Amazon at a great price.  Bonus Features include three featurettes and select commentary by Lynda Carter and producer Douglas S. Cramer. For pure, escapist fun, Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman definitely is the ""woman of the hour.""",1306195200,4,3499,5.317604355716878

2994502,5,B000X07SQ6,"One of the best superhero shows. Unlike Batman and Superman, who've had multiple movies, TV shows (live action & animated) and actors, this is Wonder Woman's sole venture into television starring in her own show. Say what you want about the animated Justice League/Justice League Unlimited shows (great shows by the way), but this captures Wonder Woman and her message of peace perfectly. Coupled with the fact that Lynda Carter is the only person (I pray that she keep the title) to have ever played her in live-action furthers my belief. I know this was done in the mid to late '70s when violence was being heavily scrutinized but I think that helps the character. She promotes peace and wants man to achieve more than petty violence and war, and pilot movie and a few moments in season 3 aside, pushing or throwing her opponents gets her message across to Nazis and other evildoers (at least she does more than her Super Friends counterpart). Now, onto the series itself.

Lynda Carter plays her perfectly. You can tell there's a certain naivet to her during the first season, as she's a complete stranger in man's world. Sure Superman came to Earth from Krypton, but he was raised as a human with American ideals and beliefs. I think my best example of this is during the first part of The Feminum Mystique, when she explains to her sister certain aspects of living in the US. This naivet is also present in season 2 but not as much. All she really does is update to 1970s living and then she develops for the rest of the series' run. Lyle Waggoner is good as Steve Trevor, but I've never read the actual Wonder Woman comics, so the only thing of Trevor's character I know of is from the series. He's a bit of a chauvinist in the first two seasons (obvious reason in the '40s and the women's libs were starting around the same time in '70s). He's a patriotic man, willing to fight for his country (evident in season one) but once they move the series into the '70s, its almost like the writers didn't know what to do with him since most of the love interest stuff they downplayed and by season 3 the character hardly featured at all. I won't really mention the other characters as they only lasted one season (Blankenship and Etta Candy), only featured for eight episodes (Joe Atkinson) or they were featured characters but dropped by mid-season two (everyone on Paradise Island). They did introduce the computer with an attitude, IRA (who was able to figure out everything before the main cast and only seemed to serve someone for Trevor to talk to when they were limiting his appearances) in season 2 and later, the annoying comic relief that is the Road Runner imitating Rover but fortunately their appearances in episodes are brief.

Production-wise, the series makes use of the special effects of the day. Wonder Woman's powers are present, including; super strength, speed (not as fast as Superman and Flash), bullet-proof bracelets, the Lasso of Truth, and her tiara boomerang (like I said, I've never really read the comics so I don't know if she has more or not). Other powers are present, like being able to mimic someone's voice, super-hearing or the occasional one-off power (for some odd reason she was able to send underwater pulses in one season 3 episode) but they weren't really used as much and eventually not at all. The special effects for the bracelets were always cool but I noticed she didn't use them as much later when the series switched to CBS. And of course, the ONE thing I do know that they incorporated into the comics was the spin she did to turn into Wonder Woman. A hallmark of the show that was always looked forward to. She has the invisible plane/jet, of which I'm glad she's not able to fly like in her more recent incarnations, but the effects used for the plane sequences could've been done better, even by '70s standards. She has multiple outfits (again, don't know if they're in the comics) which started in season 2 for some reason; she has a diving suit, a motorcycle suit (basiclly the diving suit with a helmet) and a skate-board suit (this one was only used once). By season 3, they were starting to film her in slow-motion when she runs (akin to Lindsay Wagner) but I think they were only capitalizing on The Bionic Woman's popularity. Villain wise, other than the Nazis and a few of their agents, none of her actual comic book villains appeared in the show like Cheetah, Giganta (both were featured in Challenge of the Super Friends) or Dr. Poison. Instead she battled corrupt business men/politicians (when aren't they evil or corrupt), scientists, aliens, Frank Gorshin or artists and women who have the ability... to control...ants? Hm, not sure where that one came from.

The writing is good, but at times can be downright horrible. Whenever they have Carter be evil or pretend to be a criminal, the way she does it isn't convincing and comes off (to me anyway) as stilted and wooden. The occasional big name star would show up like Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Cloris Leachman, Debra Winger, Robert Reed, Carolyn Jones, Eric Braeden, Roddy McDowall, Leif Garrett, etc. To me, out of the three seasons, the first is the best and I'll get to that in a minute. Season 3 was the weakest, mainly in writing and the fact that Wonder Woman was teaming up with random kids whom you would think Wonder Woman would want to keep out of danger. The second was able to mix the good storytelling of the first season, while dealing with the modern topics that would be present in the third. In season 1, it felt like Wonder Woman had a purpose and was fighting for a cause, the characters were more developed and they were sticking to her comic book roots. Seasons 2 and 3, she battles people who're minor inconveniences, like Martin Mull and his ability to hypnotize people with his magic...flute? Again not sure who came up with that. Her alter-ego Diana Prince featured more as well, which is both a good and bad thing. The good thing is you can develop the character of Diana as her own and its great to see her do stuff outside the Wonder Woman costume. But in a way that's also a bad thing. They started to, in my opinion anyway, decrease the actual Wonder Woman character's apperances and the only time Diana would spin into her was if it was a situation that Diana herself could not get out of.

3227892,3,B000X07SQ6,"I don't see why Warner Bros. felt a need to have to make a complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN during these tough economic times.

So I'm wondering if this is just another gimmick that Warner Bros. to try to make extra money to try to squeeze our hard earned cash during all these budget cuts going on right now or is Warner Bros. trying to compensate for all the flaws that they had in some of the WONDER WOMAN DVD box sets that were shown inadequeately.

Perhaps Warner Bros. got the idea to make a WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set from Universal since Universal had released a complete series DVD box set of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, and MIAMI VICE last year(2008)in order for Warner Bros. to compete with Universal, despite this stinkin recession were in right now.

However, I suspect that this complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN is no better and is probably no more siginificant than the first 3 individual season box sets of WONDER WOMAN for that matter either, unless of course this DVD box set may have a bonus material episode telling us both the producers and Lynda Carter's experience while filming WONDER WOMAN in the 1970's and what led to its cancellation on CBS and all, kind of like the bonus features on the last 3 seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK DVD's did, especially on THE INCREDIBLE HULK-SEASON 5 DVD when creator(Ken Johnson)explained how and why CBS had ended up cancelling THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden back in November of 1981 in the middle of its Fifth Season, due to budget cuts & controversy at CBS.

Therefore when CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK back in the mid Fall of 1981; it was quite similar to when CBS had abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in September of 1979 since I was under the impression that WONDER WOMAN was starting a 4th Season when the last 2 episodes ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" and ""Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" were shown on their original air-dates on CBS for the very first time, but I was wrong since CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN in mid September of 1979, which was perhaps due to a big slump in ratings, unlike the case with THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

As a matter of fact, THE INCREDIBLE HULK had better ratings than WONDER WOMAN did and had even lasted longer than WONDER WOMAN did too even though CBS had unfortunately cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK 2 years later after CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN since the special-effects on THE INCREDIBLE HULK got too expensive due to budget cuts from the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president along with the fact that various people felt that the Hulk was running out of steam on top of that even though the ratings on THE INCREDIBLE HULK were still high enough to last another season.

Anyway since Warner Bros. has made this WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set like Universal has made a THE INCREDIBLE HULK: THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set; this box set takes me all the way back to memory lane when both WONDER WOMAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK were part of CBS's Friday night line-up back in 1978 and 1979 when WONDER WOMAN was on every Friday night at 8PM followed by THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM.

In addition something else I noticed about both WONDER WOMAN & THE INCREDIBLE HULK was I noticed that a lot of the people who guest starred on WONDER WOMAN had also later guest starred on THE INCREDIBLE HULK too like Albert Popwell, Peter-Mark Richman(SANTA BARBARA), Jared Martin(DALLAS), Saundra Sharp, Taaffe O'Connell, Rick Springfield(GENERAL HOSPITAL), Henry Darrow(SANTA BARBARA), Al White, Denny Miller, Art Metrano, Bradford Dillman, John Reilly(ALL MY CHILDREN), Michael Baseleon, Nicholas Coster(AS THE WORLD TURNS), Frank Marth, George Caldwell, Christine Belford, Richard Narita, Frank Doubleday, Dick O'Neill, Ron Lombard, David White, Charlie Brill(SILK STALKINGS), etc.",1239753600,2,3882,4.811094452773613

3227894,5,B000X07SQ6,"What can I say, you get all 3 seasons here for a Wonderful price. The quality is fantastic in this series & the bonus features are pretty good as well. Lynda Carter has given the Wonder Woman comic book hero life in all 3 seasons. Her acting can not be touched for this series, there is an innocence about Wonder Woman that Lynda Carter had clearly portrayed in this series. Lynda was clearly born to portray this beautiful, smart & compassionate super hero, she has done this super hero justice. Season 1 is the best in the series dealing with the war of the Nazis, many of my favorite episodes are within season 1. Seasons 2 & 3 are just as good but the war is not over,.. technology & man create havoc for the young princess Diana making each episode a joy to watch. You can't go wrong with this complete set, makes a great gift for the super hero fan or any Wonder Woman fan.

3227950,5,B000X07SQ6,"This is a review of the 2016 UK Region 2 Wonder Woman TV series The Complete Collection. It is on 21 single-sided dual-layer discs in a very compact paper box set. The first season has 5 discs and season 2 and 3 have 8 discs each. Each season's discs are in their own colorful glossy foldout cardboard slotted inserts with episode descriptions printed on them. The discs play fine in my multi-region DVD player. The shows appear to be complete. They are not HD but picture and sound are clear and music appears to be intact. I would choose this set over the old 2005 US region 1 set which were on 11 double-sided double-layered discs and prone to many playback problems. The newer 2017 US region 1 repackaged box set is on single-sided dual-layer discs but are highly compressed and also has many playback problems. The only problem I see with this Region 2 set is that on the back of the box it says ""59 episodes plus the pilot movie on 11 discs"". This is wrong because there are ""59 episodes plus the pilot movie on 21 discs."" This must be a misprint for the Region 2 release. Again you must have a multi-region player to view this set.",1502150400,3,1138,4.398104265402844
3227951,1,B000X07SQ6,"This review will not focus on the merits of this enduring TV series since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy it on DVD.

The picture was in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio while the audio was in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo, with the sets housed in fold-out digipak cases.  While there was no digital re-mastering done, the series still looked better than it had ever looked before.  Unfortunately, bonus features were paltry but more tragically, the series was released on double-sided discs, which were easily prone to fingerprints, scratches, other other issues that could easily affect playback.  In 2007, WB released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000X07SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman: The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set, which simply repackaged the exact same discs, but this time in an outer cardboard sleeve to house the individual season sets.  There were 11 discs total spanning all 3 seasons of 59 episodes plus the pilot movie.

In 2017, WB re-issued&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B06XT497R9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B06XT5KNCZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-3/dp/B06XT7FP45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 3</a>, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B06XT5T1GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;on DVD.  This time, however, the episodes were on single-sided discs housed in hard plastic Amaray cases, which were the same size as standard DVD cases.  While this appeared to finally rectify the flaws of the previous releases, upon further inspection, this was hardly the case.  The disc count for the series remained the same, meaning all 59 episodes at 45 minutes each, plus the 90 minute pilot movie are compressed onto just 11 singe-sided discs!  The result is horrible picture quality that looks heavily pixelated, with roughly half the visual details of the original DVD releases.  This is truly a shame since WB finally had the chance to give this series the proper DVD treatment that it deserved.  For fans, getting this series on DVD means choosing the lesser of two evils.  This reviewer begrudgingly recommends buying the original 2005 releases, as the picture and sound quality are vastly superior to the 2017 releases.  But again, one has to inspect them carefully for any playback issues.

Overall, the Lynda Carter Wonder Woman TV series has yet to receive an exemplary home video release truly befitting the legacy of such a pop cultural phenomenon.  For those who own the previous DVD releases, there is no reason to upgrade to the 2017 releases given the heavily compressed look of the episodes.  With the overwhelming success of the 2017&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman/dp/B0714QRG4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman </a>&nbsp;movie, one can only hope that WB feels compelled to once again revisit this classic series on home video, perhaps on blu-ray.",1501718400,23,3920,7.375536480686695

3227953,2,B000X07SQ6,"Despite the many reviews about skipping and freezing discs I took a chance in buying this set when it dropped down in price. Now I see why it dropped down in price. Having played a few discs of this series, they do indeed freeze and skip very frequently. I will be returning this boxset soon. It should be no surprise these dvds are junk bc they are duel discs, a few episodes on one side, flip the disc, a few more episodes on the other side. This box was produced in 2007 very cheaply so that's why it skips.
The show itself is very dated and cheesy but fun none the less. If they ever sell it on Blu-ray and do it properly I will buy it again.
Bottom line: save your money and don't buy this set because it's just a mess.

It's been well worth it. It's a better value than digital downloads, and slipping the DVD in my laptop is practically the same as pulling up a download anyway. The series brings tons of joy with its campy fun! It still remains grounded in the Wonder Woman mythos of violence only when necessary, but there is some violence and it's always fun to see Diana Prince kick some butt. The Gal Gadot/Patty Jenkins movie just came out, and anyone looking for more Diana/Steve interaction is sure to be pleased with the series! There's definitely more of a delicate vibe in the series versus the new movie, but the underlying electric current of Diana's personality is still there.",1500854400,3,848,4.5855263157894735

It had the same symptoms described in several other one-star reviews.  I returned the set and exchanged it for the one remaining set and the exact same problems occurred with disc one of season two.  It's frustrating, of course, but also disappointing.  It appears to be a quality control/manufacturing issue and I'll be returning this set as well for store credit.  If you choose to take a chance and order this set (and likely the individual sets as well) consider yourself warned!  Shame too, because the set is really nicely done:  sturdy, reflective packaging with a nice mix of comic and real-life photos, special features and the fact that it's complete.  Reviews are saying things like ""some discs don't play but the show is great"" and giving it five stars.  The quality of the content (the episodes) may be great but the media they're presented on are defective which renders the set useless!

I'm complaining about yet another company cheaping out to the extreme on DVD products.  It's nice to see shows I remember from long ago being released on modern media, but it's such a major disappointment when companies choose to use the worst possible way of producing the media -- double-sided-double-layer DVDs.  I'd probably prefer VHS -- at least those played.

I had not purchased an all-double-sided-double-layer DVD set since ADV's miserable pressing of Andromeda.  I was astonished to see how much worse things are now.  Like Andromeda, the outer layer of each side (usually one or two episodes) plays as well as one can expect from a cheap production run, and the inner layer suffers problems.

Unlike Andromeda, which was subject to skipping and stuttering on the inner layer, this pressing of Wonder Woman is a disaster.  Two of my DVD players will not recognise the discs at all -- giving a 'NO DISC' indication after spending minutes trying to read them; one other DVD player can read the outer layer but on switching to the inner layer stalls for a minute or so then says 'NO DISC'.  Three BD players act the same as the third DVD player, able to play the outer layer on each side but as soon as they try to read the inner layer they either say 'NO DISC' or skip large swaths of the show after long stalls (for example, season 1 episode 2 time to run is randomly somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes, but only about 2 or 3 minutes of that is actually playing parts of the episode, with the player spending the rest of it trying to read the disc).

If they had bothered to do a decent production run of this, I think it would have been good.  The video and audio (that I could play) seem reasonably clean and clear, and the discs were packaged in a case that would reasonably be expected to protect them instead of those stupid paper bags or slick boxes that seem to be the production tendency lately.

I would have happily paid a little more for a decent production run of this.  Although doing this would have slightly reduced the studio's profits, I think it would have sharply reduced returns and defects.  It took several tries (and selecting individual discs out of multiple boxes) to get a couple seasons of Andromeda that would play.  From what I see here, I wonder whether there would be a single fully playable set of this in existence.

Maybe someone will produce this in BD form one day, and hopefully they won't try to violate standards and do a quad-layer-double-sided BD to try to pack the entire season onto a single disc.",1485993600,20,2734,4.524390243902439

I started watching the set recently. Pilot played fine, along with the first 3 episodes. After that, it all went to hell. Skipping left and right. Some discs decided they didn't want to play at all. One of the discs has a noticeable case of disc rot. I've had DVDs skip before...usually it's rare, but it's happened. Nothing that a little cleaning couldn't fix. Not these discs. I've tried them on 4 different players. 3 of them Blu-ray players, 1 DVD-only. Same issue. Even my PC gives read errors on the faulty discs.

It does this on two DVD players, one of which is known to be able to play ""anything"".  I was lucky the errors were on the first disc--it could have had errors only on a disc in the third season: I would not realize it until Amazon's window for returns closed.  I am returning that first collection, but ordered a second as a replacement.  It, too, had errors on the first disc (second side), but not at the same exact locations on the disc.

3228225,5,B000X07SQ6,"I love Wonder Woman. Lynda Carter played a great Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman was smart and had a great alter ego. This brings me back to my childhood. I love that, Wonder Woman, was also, written by the creator of the polygraph test(better known, as the lie detector test), which is why her golden lasso, made people tell the truth. Great actors visited the show and it had a great story plot.  Oh, not to mention, everywhere else on the internet sells this same collectors set for $100 and Amazon has it here for $40, which is a steal... So go get yourself, this collectors set of the Wonder Woman television series and keep the american spirit alive. Go, Wonder Woman!!!",1446768000,4,671,4.545454545454546
3228226,4,B000X07SQ6,"If you are into comic books or just like entertaining shows, I would recommend his DVD set.  I found the stories enjoyable and I like the Wonder Woman character.  Lynda Carter certainly looks the part of Wonder Woman.  Her acting may not win her an Oscar, but it is also no detriment to the series.  There is also a little bonus material.  I really like the interviews in which Lynda Carter and Douglas Cramer, the executive producer, were featured.  They also do a commentary on the pilot episode which I liked.  For the price I considered it a good buy.",1446422400,2,555,4.49

3228473,3,B000X07SQ6,"Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic superheroines in comic book history, so much so in fact, it's hard to believe she has only one television series on her CV.  But here it is: the Complete Collection, which gathers all 60 episodes of the Wonder Woman series together in one attractive package.  Season One includes the original pilot plus 11 other episodes produced for ABC between 1975-76, and was set in the World War II era.  Season Two features the ""relaunch"" pilot, moving Wonder Woman to the contemporary era (1977) and also representing a change in networks, with the show switching to CBS.  Season Three keeps the action going, though the focus shifts to more teenager-oriented theme and becomes more oriented on Wonder Woman's alter ego, Diana Prince.

The pilot and the Season Three premier (""One Of Our Teenage Idols Is Missing"") feature commentary by Lynda Carter, who played the title role.  There are also short documentaries included in each Season package.  The picture quality is excellent; it's as if the shows were just broadcast yesterday.  Except for a few small edits--the opening credits for the pilot have been changed to those for the standard Season One intro, for instance--the episodes are show as they were originally presented.

If nothing else, Wonder Woman: The Complete Collection proves the old saying that ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""  Taken pound for pound, this is actually a subpar series.  The scripts are only average at best, the stories don't generate much tension, and most of the villains are stale cardboard cut-outs of each other.  Yet despite all the problems, Wonder Woman still comes across as an enjoyable show, primarily due to one factor: Lynda Carter.  Much has been made about how perfect Carter was for the role, both in physical attractiveness and the degree of humanity she brought to the part--and Carter deserves every word of that praise, and then some.  Modern-day actresses scoff at the idea of running around fighting crime in such a scanty costume; Carter not only made it believable, but even perfectly normal.  Her approach to playing Wonder Woman as a ""normal woman, only with super-powers"" was a masterstroke that kept the character fresh, dynamic, and a treat to watch even if the proceedings going on around her grew rather tedious.

Season One, despite its shorter length, actually has the best episodes.  The pilot and the first two regular episodes are the only ones using plotlines drawn directly from the source material, featuring villains from the comic book series; perhaps not surprisingly, these are the three best episodes of the entire series.  Season One also features an up-and-coming actress named Debra Winger as Wonder Girl; the three episodes she appears in are also quite magical.  Seasons Two and Three are more of a mixed bag.  While Carter herself has gone on record saying she preferred working on the series after it moved to the contemporary era, a lot of the magic which permeated the show during Season One began to dissipate throughout Season Two, and by the time Season Three started the show was running on fumes.

Having said that, though, there are a few standout moments during the 1970s era of the show, particularly the episode ""The Man Who Could Move The World,"" where Wonder Woman has to face a Japanese survivor from the US internment camps, who blames her for the death of his brother three decades earlier.  The subject of the US interning innocent Japanese-Americans during World War Ii remains a sensitive one to this day, and it was a bold move of the series to confront it.  Had there been more episodes like this one, the series might very well have run even longer.

Wonder Woman: The Complete Series may not be television at its finest, yet it does have Lynda Carter.  And as unlikely as it sounds, that really is enough reason to give this show a look.  In her remarkable red-white-and-blue costume, proud and confident yet also compassionate and caring, Carter set the gold standard for how super-heroines should be portrayed.  For that, both Carter--and the Wonder Woman series she anchored--deserves its place in history.",1419984000,15,4167,4.932664756446991

3228725,4,B000X07SQ6,"I just started watching this show on tv in the past year, so I apologize if I am trampling on anyone's warm and fuzzy memories from the 70's, (I was a child in the 70's myself) but if not for Lynda Carter's excellent performances, this show would have fizzled out long before it did. My problem with this show is that some of the plots are very weak and hokey, the sound effects are awful, (such as when she jumps) and as for the special effects: I think they did a better job on the Batman show, which was done a decade earlier.

Now that I've said all that, and infuriated the hardcore WW fans, I will say that I enjoyed the first season set in WWII, and again, Lynda Carter is great in the role. She always looks sincere, and looks like she's giving it her all, even when burdened by a ridiculous plot and awful effects. I wanted to give this series 3 stars, but just because of Lynda I put another star on there to make it 4 stars. If you are a devoted fan of the Wonder Woman character, or you have warm memories of watching this in the 70's, this dvd set is well worth picking up.",1407110400,,1086,4.122641509433962

I couldn't wait to find this series in a special boxed edition & when it went on sale, I had to purchase it immediately!  This could have only been better if it would have been made available in BluRay!!  Or if Lynda Carter actually came with the set!  The DVDs play amazing & the clarity is well done.  I recommend this set to anyone who really likes these older shows; I have Charlie's Angels, too.

Just remember one thing, Lynda Carter is the only person to EVER play Wonder Woman.  There have been how many different people play Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Green Lantern, The Hulk, etc. I don't think anyone could ever replace her in the role she played on TV.  And These were real ""TV Prime Time Shows"" W/O FOUL LANGUAGE, SEX, OR MAJOR VIOLENCE!

3228751,5,B000X07SQ6,"Wow! What a wonderful DVD set. I am so happy to have Wonder Woman back on my TV. And this time, my children are even watching with me. I have missed the days of watching WW and now it is at the ease of my fingertips.

Price:

Years ago I looked at treating myself to just one season. It would have been way too expensive. However, with this set, you couldn't ask for more. All  three seasons are here in this set and it is well worth the money. It includes all the wonderful episodes and bonus material. One season alone at Wal-Mart was almost $40, here you get all three for the same price.

Quality:

For having been originally filmed in the late 70s, the shows are of amazing quality. I have not had any issues with any of the DVDs. The DVDs probably even have a better quality than the original episodes airing on TV did. I am very pleased with the clarity. My box set also arrived with no damage. None of my corners were dented, there were no dings in my box set,  no scratches to the outside, and each season was snug inside the boxed holder.

Ease of use:

Now you would think with a DVD how could you go wrong, right? This is where I have the only issue. None of the disks are numbered, nor do they state which side is A and which is B. This proved a fun adventure when my son took the disks out trying to ""help"" me and they were all mixed up. So, while the DVDs themselves are easy to use, it would be easier if you could simply look at them and know what order they go in. I recommend finding a way to number them if possible.

Graphics:

Remember, these were originally filmed in the 70s and the story lines (who are we kidding) are kind of cheesy, but for back then, and EVERYTHING Wonder Woman could do, the graphics are great. Seeing Wonder Woman use her Lasso of Truth, spin out of her civilian outfit, or bend bars, was pretty high tech. Plus, the box the set came in, had some pretty sweet raised texture graphics. I'm happy.

Journey back in time:

If you were, or are a Wonder Woman fan you simply cant ask for anything better than the original TV series in full! Lynda Carter and Lyle Waggoner will win you over just like it was yesterday. I found myself rooting for the same outcomes I did years ago and enjoying the same smiles I had as a kid. This series easily transports you back in time where ""All our hopes are pinned on you. And the magic that you do. You're a wonder, Wonder Woman!""

This is truly a gift for the Wonder Woman fanand a Wonder Woman blanket to get cozy on the couch and watch episode after episode.",1399334400,28,2542,4.173824130879345

One of the best investments you can ever make! At the beginning I was afraid of buying it because I have a Blu-ray player and DVDs don't look very good on it despite their conversion system and HD TVs only display excellent image from HD sources. Well, even though it's DVD technology the image on my Blu-ray is just as WONDERFUL as Wonder Woman! I just have to say the image quality is mind blowing! It looks like a 4:3 Blu-ray adaptation. Only one of the discs in season two was faulty as the Blu-ray player didn't read it and neither could my laptop computer. However my old computer red it perfectly. Season 1 is absolutely priceless! Maybe something bad is the sound as it is monophonic, but that's how it was originally made for TV in the 70s! The saying ""it's the whole package"" literally applies here since the packaging makes justice to the content, the design of the boxes and the graphic design inside them is to die for! For any comic lover, especially those that grew in the 70s or 80s, it's a MUST have!",1394409600,7,1160,4.425233644859813

3228805,5,B000X07SQ6,"I grew up watching these on TV.  They were silly then, and even sillier now.  However, they have such a sense of fun and adventure to the episodes it's difficult not to smile.  These are clean, so you can watch with family and lack most of the nihilism present in modern television.  While I enjoy the modern sci/fi, super heroes, etc. for the most part, they are markedly dark in tone.  I don't come away with a sense of dread after watching something like this.

Lynda Carter never misses a beat and always seems to play her character seriously no matter how ridiculous the script.  Debrah Winger also surprised me, as Wonder Woman's inexperienced and far less effective sister.  I didn't remember her having a sister in show [it was a long time ago], so it was a fun cameo [before she was a movie actress].  I haven't gotten past the first season yet, which has so far all been based on WWII and thwarting enemy agents and schemes.  I'm looking forward to further seasons and the scenarios they bring, as I believe they are set in the show's ""present"" times [late 1970's].",1391385600,5,1075,4.523316062176166

I've bought the dvds out of nostalgia and it was fun to revisit the  characters (e.g. the neurotic queen of the amazons (at least in the early episodes), the hilarious nazi officials and spies and a very young Debra Winger (dressed like Polyanna) as WW younger sister aka Wonder Girl; the special FX are awful but representative of that timeframe and it is somehow embarassing to admit that like them as they are . Silly plots (even back then) but who really cared/cares? So much for suspension of disbelief. Cheesy 1970's show? Perhaps, but this one delivers quite a few cherished memories.  The image and sound qualities are great and the package itself is a pop culture piece worth keeping. The original Brazilian Portuguese dubbing  (as I remember it) sure added charisma to the show's characters (the actor's real voices were somehow disappointing), but, unfortunately, it is not available as in the case of the Hart to Hart dvd collection.

After the failed attempt with Cathy Lee Crosby in the fist tv pilot.  Not her fault who ever was developing this was just asleep did not care or had no idea or was on drugs.

Then ABC came out with The new Original Wonder Woman and WOW OH GOSH YES YES YES. Linda Carter who will always be that character in my eyes was just perfect she was Wonder Woman made flesh.

Stunning in beauty and made us believe like christopher reeves that super heros are real.

For those of us who loved the show and want to pass it on to our daughters nieces or daughters of friends this is the tv show to have after all little girls need heros to.

3228981,4,B000X07SQ6,"William Moulton Marston's super-empowered Superheroine comes to vibrant life in this ""blast from the past"" 1976-1979 series. The series shares some of the same ""high camp"" sensibilities as ""Batman"" (1966-1968). But ""Wonder Woman"" holds up much better than ""Batman."" Lynda Carter is the perfect embodiment of the comic book Superheroine, and she portrays her with a captivating sincerity. Like Christopher Reeve as ""Superman"", Lynda Carter plays Wonder Woman as the friend you always wish you had. Carter believes in the feminist message of Wonder Woman and the importance of her mission. She delivers the important Season 1 lines, ""a society that does not respect the power of women is doomed to failure"" with strong conviction.
  Season 1 is extremely faithful to Wonder Woman's comic book orgins, and is set during World War II.  Amazon Princess Diana discovers the dishy Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner from ""The Carol Burnett Show"") after he crash-lands on her mystical home of Paradise Island. After he is nursed back to health, Diana returns with him to America (as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman) to help in the battle against the Nazis. Debra Winger makes a rather inauspicious professional debut as Diana's younger sister Drucilla (A.K.A. ""Wonder Girl."") Wonder Girl is definitely ""Blunder Girl"" when she accidentally gives away the secret location of Paradise Island, which is quickly invaded by Nazis, in the episodes ""The Feminum Mystique, Parts I and II.""
  Season 1 has a rather innocent charm. But producers wisely realized that the series would not survive if Wonder Woman continued fighting Nazis forever. When the Series switched from ABC to CBS for Seasons 2 and 3, the series zoomed forward in time to ""present day"" 1977-1979.  Ageless  Diana/Wonder Woman returns to America to work at the Inter-Agency Defense Command (The ""I.A.D.C.) with Steve Trevor, Jr. Lyle Waggoner returns as the son of the character he portrayed in Season 1. Producer Douglas S. Cramer decided to extinquish any romantic sparks between Diana and Steve. Steve became Diana's boss at the I.A.D.C. and their relationship remained platonic.  Wonder Woman wasn't quite finished fighting Nazis. A mad scientist creates a clone of Hitler in the episode ""Anschuluss '77."" Other ghosts, and a terrible misunderstanding, from World War II are confronted in the episode ""The Man Who Could Move The World.'
  Diana/Wonder Woman often went off on exciting missions on her own, fighting mad scientists, a manicial magician, a demented toymaker, a disembodied brain, and several alien terrorists from outer space (""Mind Stealers From Outer Space, Part I and II"" and ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret, Part I and II"")!
Memorable guest stars include John Saxon,  Cloris Leachman, Fannie Flagg, Carolyn Jones, Beatrice Straight,  Robert Reed and Eve Plumb (both from ""The Brady Bunch""), Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development""), Roddy McDowall, Dack Rambo (""All My Children""),  Rick Springfield  (""General Hospital""),  Henry Gibson (""Laugh-In""). ""Mary Poppins"" co-stars Hermione Baddeley and Arthur Malet, Ed Bagley, Jr. and ""Knots Landing"" co-stars Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackleford.
  All 60  episodes are collected here on 11 double-sided DVDS, in an attractive, comic book design Box Set, offered by Amazon at a great price.  Bonus Features include three featurettes and select commentary by Lynda Carter and producer Douglas S. Cramer. For pure, escapist fun, Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman definitely is the ""woman of the hour.""",1306195200,4,3499,5.317604355716878

3228999,5,B000X07SQ6,"One of the best superhero shows. Unlike Batman and Superman, who've had multiple movies, TV shows (live action & animated) and actors, this is Wonder Woman's sole venture into television starring in her own show. Say what you want about the animated Justice League/Justice League Unlimited shows (great shows by the way), but this captures Wonder Woman and her message of peace perfectly. Coupled with the fact that Lynda Carter is the only person (I pray that she keep the title) to have ever played her in live-action furthers my belief. I know this was done in the mid to late '70s when violence was being heavily scrutinized but I think that helps the character. She promotes peace and wants man to achieve more than petty violence and war, and pilot movie and a few moments in season 3 aside, pushing or throwing her opponents gets her message across to Nazis and other evildoers (at least she does more than her Super Friends counterpart). Now, onto the series itself.

Lynda Carter plays her perfectly. You can tell there's a certain naivet to her during the first season, as she's a complete stranger in man's world. Sure Superman came to Earth from Krypton, but he was raised as a human with American ideals and beliefs. I think my best example of this is during the first part of The Feminum Mystique, when she explains to her sister certain aspects of living in the US. This naivet is also present in season 2 but not as much. All she really does is update to 1970s living and then she develops for the rest of the series' run. Lyle Waggoner is good as Steve Trevor, but I've never read the actual Wonder Woman comics, so the only thing of Trevor's character I know of is from the series. He's a bit of a chauvinist in the first two seasons (obvious reason in the '40s and the women's libs were starting around the same time in '70s). He's a patriotic man, willing to fight for his country (evident in season one) but once they move the series into the '70s, its almost like the writers didn't know what to do with him since most of the love interest stuff they downplayed and by season 3 the character hardly featured at all. I won't really mention the other characters as they only lasted one season (Blankenship and Etta Candy), only featured for eight episodes (Joe Atkinson) or they were featured characters but dropped by mid-season two (everyone on Paradise Island). They did introduce the computer with an attitude, IRA (who was able to figure out everything before the main cast and only seemed to serve someone for Trevor to talk to when they were limiting his appearances) in season 2 and later, the annoying comic relief that is the Road Runner imitating Rover but fortunately their appearances in episodes are brief.

Production-wise, the series makes use of the special effects of the day. Wonder Woman's powers are present, including; super strength, speed (not as fast as Superman and Flash), bullet-proof bracelets, the Lasso of Truth, and her tiara boomerang (like I said, I've never really read the comics so I don't know if she has more or not). Other powers are present, like being able to mimic someone's voice, super-hearing or the occasional one-off power (for some odd reason she was able to send underwater pulses in one season 3 episode) but they weren't really used as much and eventually not at all. The special effects for the bracelets were always cool but I noticed she didn't use them as much later when the series switched to CBS. And of course, the ONE thing I do know that they incorporated into the comics was the spin she did to turn into Wonder Woman. A hallmark of the show that was always looked forward to. She has the invisible plane/jet, of which I'm glad she's not able to fly like in her more recent incarnations, but the effects used for the plane sequences could've been done better, even by '70s standards. She has multiple outfits (again, don't know if they're in the comics) which started in season 2 for some reason; she has a diving suit, a motorcycle suit (basiclly the diving suit with a helmet) and a skate-board suit (this one was only used once). By season 3, they were starting to film her in slow-motion when she runs (akin to Lindsay Wagner) but I think they were only capitalizing on The Bionic Woman's popularity. Villain wise, other than the Nazis and a few of their agents, none of her actual comic book villains appeared in the show like Cheetah, Giganta (both were featured in Challenge of the Super Friends) or Dr. Poison. Instead she battled corrupt business men/politicians (when aren't they evil or corrupt), scientists, aliens, Frank Gorshin or artists and women who have the ability... to control...ants? Hm, not sure where that one came from.

The writing is good, but at times can be downright horrible. Whenever they have Carter be evil or pretend to be a criminal, the way she does it isn't convincing and comes off (to me anyway) as stilted and wooden. The occasional big name star would show up like Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Cloris Leachman, Debra Winger, Robert Reed, Carolyn Jones, Eric Braeden, Roddy McDowall, Leif Garrett, etc. To me, out of the three seasons, the first is the best and I'll get to that in a minute. Season 3 was the weakest, mainly in writing and the fact that Wonder Woman was teaming up with random kids whom you would think Wonder Woman would want to keep out of danger. The second was able to mix the good storytelling of the first season, while dealing with the modern topics that would be present in the third. In season 1, it felt like Wonder Woman had a purpose and was fighting for a cause, the characters were more developed and they were sticking to her comic book roots. Seasons 2 and 3, she battles people who're minor inconveniences, like Martin Mull and his ability to hypnotize people with his magic...flute? Again not sure who came up with that. Her alter-ego Diana Prince featured more as well, which is both a good and bad thing. The good thing is you can develop the character of Diana as her own and its great to see her do stuff outside the Wonder Woman costume. But in a way that's also a bad thing. They started to, in my opinion anyway, decrease the actual Wonder Woman character's apperances and the only time Diana would spin into her was if it was a situation that Diana herself could not get out of. Which makes me think ""Why didn't you just go in as Wonder Woman in the first place?"" But for all the series' good episodes (my favorites being the pilot, Last of the Two Dollar Bills & Judgement From Outer Space from season 1, The Return of Wonder Woman, Anschluss '77, Light Fingered Lady & Screaming Javelin from season 2 and Stolen Faces, Going, Going, Gone, & The Starships Are Coming from season 3) and bad episodes (Formicida, Gault's Brain, My Teenage Idol is Missing and The Murderous Missile), it was an excellent show with great actors and writers, much better than the garbage they show today.",1275609600,5,6950,4.625910931174089

I gave this only four stars because the third season is more than a bit week storywise. The guest stars were featured too much and Wonder Women was too slow to catch the bad-guys.

You need a way to somehow get these by download through a service or other saving method. These disks ruin quickly due to being double sided.

8226338,5,B000X07SQ6,"Way before Gal Gadot donned the character in three blockbuster movies: ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"", ""Wonder Woman"" & ""Justice League"", former Miss USA Lynda Carter dons the role of Wonder Woman that made her a star & an international sex symbol. Here is the complete series of the 1977-1979 TV series. The first season took place during World War II just like in the early comics where Steve Trevor crashes on Paradise Island and Princess Diana fell in love with him the moment she look at him. Then she took Trevor back to America after she won a contest and fight for justice as Wonder Woman while donned a secret identity of Diana Prince. Of course, the second & third season took place in the 1970s where Wonder Woman fights alongside the son of her former love interest Col. Steve Trevor while working as an agent as Diana Prince.

This is a great series that help boast the popularity of Wonder Woman back in the 70s and Lynda Carter was smokin' hot as Wonder Woman.",1524441600,,982,4.548022598870056
