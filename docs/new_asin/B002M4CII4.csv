8373554,3,B002M4CII4,"I have watched it completely through three times.  (I did this because I felt that I must be missing something - after all, this was an Academy Award winner.)

A couple of facts before I launch into opinion.  It is in Black and White.  It is in the French language, but it does include subtitles.

This version comes from Korea, but it is not ""locked"" to any particular DVD zone.  In other words, you will not need a player set to play videos from Southeast Asia to play this DVD.

** Beware Opinions Follow **

The cinematography was very interesting.  In many of the scenes, most of the cast remains ""frozen"" while the camera zooms and frames to a couple or a table.  The actors and actresses that are ""frozen"" still breath and move slightly so it is direction and camera work, not a special effect per se.

The film is **very** artsy.  There is a poem repeated throughout the film.  The film starts and ends with a play, and the play is the story that the film tells.  It is the story within a story within a story cliche (and, it must have already been cliche by 1960 when this film was released).

The story is a bit confusing, and the people that you think are a couple are not really the couple.  That should not actually ruin anything for you as the story is tertiary to why you are likely watching it.

This is a film by artists to be appreciated by hard core filmography practitioners and students.

Just to be open, I enjoy a wide variety of films and cinema, but pretentious films are among my least favorite type of movie.

If you are a budding director then this film might make an interesting study.

Both of these films are good and bad in the same ways.",1525046400,4,1888,4.695121951219512
8373555,5,B002M4CII4,"I was concerned this Blu-Ray would be inferior to the much hyped Criterion edition (out of print)  but this is a beautiful looking remastered edition.  Every scene is sharp and crystal clear with superb detail.  The sound is excellent too.  I bought it from Amazon UK for $20, including postage (their last copy).  Dont pay $50 or more  sooner or later this will be available at a reasonable price, so shop around.

If you buy this for the breathtaking visuals you won't be disappointed.  Coco Chanel designed Ms. Seyrigs elegant couture clothes.  Most of the interiors were shot in the palace King Ludwig II was born and raised in, and its very much the same style as the castles he later build.  The dialogue and screenplay are somewhat pretentious and don't look for a coherent storyline.  Much of it is dreamlike and surreal, but if you just let yourself go and immerse yourself in the film, it takes you to a place you haven't been before.  Its a glamourous journey.",1505260800,,971,4.647058823529412

This is one of my very favorite films because it is unlike any other that had come before. My reaction itself, upon first seeing it, was similarly unfamiliar and oddly liberating - certainly exhilarating, much as listening to a Brandenburg Concerto for the first time might well quicken the pulse and sharpen the mind.

It soon became clear to me that I was being invited (by the Director, Alain Resnais) to participate in the film's construction - that is to say, in interpreting the assemblage of discrete and frequently contradictory tableaux which the filmmaker, himself, was unwilling to reject for the final film. He presented us with these parallel universe choices as an array of possibilities that challenged us to the film's interpretation. In this way, we became his collaborators.

The atmospherics are simply stunning! The film had to be shot in black-and-white as its high-contrast, and high-key lighting, compelled it to operate at a level of remove from the demands of reality. It's moody and abstract sensibilities imbue it with a froideur and a menace.

The film's music score had to be of a very arch and spare pipe organ composition by Francis Seyrig. The lugubrious and coldly unsentimental work ensured that the film's people, space and time could not be mistaken for those in our own world. Instead, these fragmentary and incongruous scenes churn, merge, separate and change their minds along the way.

The film itself is a kind of notebook (or should I say ""Cahier"") in which endless possibilities were scribbled as they came to the mind of Alain Resnais, but subsequently retained, possibly in the interest of incomprehensibility. That is, after all, just the point of Last Year At Marienbad. Perhaps.",1494028800,,1865,5.0816993464052285

8373559,5,B002M4CII4,"One of the best foreign films that I have see. It is surrealistic, and lacks a linear plot. The film demands careful concentration and questioning.  For example:

  where?  one place and time or more?
  real?  when?
Event occurs
  unreal?  dream?-whose?
  fantasy- in whose mind?
  why?
No part of the film was shot in Marienbad.",1411257600,3,329,4.833333333333333
