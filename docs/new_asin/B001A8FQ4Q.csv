The interviews with my brother Vernon Gosney and the son of Jim Jones--Stephan Jones--is what sets this retelling apart form the rest.

Some of the docudramas come across like typical TV melodramas where the producers would rather make it up as they go along because the concept of the largest mass murder/suicide in recent history was dramatic enough for them.

It was strange watching a reenactment of things my brother did as portrayed by an actor.

Where I see flaws in this DVD is that the producers had access to people who were directly involved yet the sequence of events and even how the events unfolded weren't completely accurate.  Stephan Jones was not in Jonestown at the time of the murders nor was he at the airstrip so hes not in a position to provide testimony.  My brother told me of what he recalls and the story has not wavered in 35 years so Im inclined to believe him.  What he tells me differs from what was shown here.  The differences are minor and inconsequential but since the producers had access to the truth, why not tell it?

At the end, it would have been nice had they told a little about the survivors.  They showed a sentence or two about a small number of the survivors but what about the rest?  What happened to the reported $26 million in Peoples Temple assets?  What happened not only to Charles Garry but also  Mark Lane--the two attorneys who ran through the woods (Mark Lane wasn't even mentioned in this DVD)?  All told there were about two dozen who got away--what was their story?

Overall, though, still an outstanding DVD.",1389571200,14,1723,4.584967320261438

The PBS Jonestown documentary has more archival footage and interviews than this A&E poduction.  The dramatized scenes are good, but I prefer the original films and sound recordings.  That said, this video is worth seeking out and watching.",1278288000,9,461,4.654320987654321
8276424,5,B001A8FQ4Q,"Of all the specials and documentaries chronicling Rev. Jim Jones, the People's Temple, and Jonestown, I believe this is the best one yet. It's longer than the rest and it splits between interviews and re-enactments. I deeply remember the interviews from Sherwin Harris who remembers seeing his daughter, Liane Harris, and having a dinner with her, her mother and ex-wife Sharon who was Linda to him and her half-brother and sister on November 18, 1978 in Georgetown headquarters of Lamaha Gardens. Sharon almost resisted but the dinner went well and the bond that appeared broken between father and daughter was re-established. They said goodbye but Sherwin thought they would see each other again on the next day to visit Jonestown but Jonestown was no more and Liane was found dead alongside her mother, half-brother, and half-sister in the bathroom of Lamaha Gardens. They were the only four victims beside the 913 in Jonestown to follow Jones' final orders. Sharon was Jones' right hand woman who would do anything for him even taking the lives of her children and herself. There is also Stephan Jones, Jim and Marcie's only biological child, who was in Georgetown with the Jonestown basketball team. Even was only 19 years old when he lost his parents, siblings, friends, girlfriend, and his entire community. He was arrested for fear that he might become his father's heir. Nothing could be further from the truth, Stephan has led a normal life in California. He and the survivors beared the brunt of surviving and explaining to those about Jonestown and the events of November 18, 1978. What could have been different? We'll never know. Then there were other casualties of those who spoke out like the unsolved Mills case in Berkeley, California and the murder-suicide in 1983 with Paula Adams and former Guyana ambassador to the UNited States Laurence ""Bonny"" Mann and their son in Bethesda, Maryland. Thirty years later, everybody should be picking up the pieces and be weary of con-artists, charlatans, and a slick salesman who offered his people who he claimed to love so much of salvation, paradise, and freedom but took their belongings including life savings, homes, properties, and even their free will in order to satisfy himself. Jones was also dying at the time anyway and would have died in two weeks in one report from his drug abuse. Ironic since he helped so many drug addicts, prostitutes, homeless, neglected senior citizens, and impoverished families. I only wondered if a higher power had intervened earlier than we could have avoided the burials over almost a thousand human beings who were simply ignored. They all had names, faces, and lives but there is a simple memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California without mentioning the names of all the victims until now. Why didn't God do something? Maybe it was supposed to happen for a reason but I think we have ignored for so long that it doesn't affect us. Every year on September 11, we read the names of those deceased at the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It's carried on live television. For those who died on November 18, 1978, it took thirty years to build a proper memorial since half of those who died are interred there in a mass grave like in a war or earthquake. Now, they have names, faces, and ages which have all but escaped public memory. I wished that they would release this documentary for the world to see Jonestown and People's Temple not as brainwashed zombies but human beings who had a cause that they strongly signed over. The main problem of the cause was their leader, Jim Jones, who held his people who he claimed so much to love as his hostages. Afraid that they would leave him before he did. If only somebody had shot him earlier or let the gates down to let those members flee. There would have been some to have stayed behind like Sharon Amos, Maria Katsaris, Marcie Jones, and others who truly believed in Jones as a godlike figure. sadly, we'll never know now what might have been to have saved so many lives especially those who were children. A third of the victims were children and another third were elderly. Jones pronounced ""we live together and we'll die together."" Sadly, they did but not without guns pointed to their heads to be forced.",1228176000,7,4304,4.841248303934871
