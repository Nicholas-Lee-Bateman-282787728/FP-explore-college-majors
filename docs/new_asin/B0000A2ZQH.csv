7995557,1,B0000A2ZQH,"Putting aside the entire subject of the atrocity, this movie is absolutely horrendous just for the infamous cat scene.  I strongly disagree with any attempts to justify such unnecessary cruelty as art and I think that one scene waters down his the entire message of the film.  After watching that scene, the rest of the movie is simply about the shock of seeing an innocent animal being slaughtered for entertainment.

I am missing point?  Probably.  But when someone spews out garbage like this one, I hardly can be blamed.  In the interest of art, I would be more entertained in seeing the director being thrown to a pack of hungry rats.  That would truly be educational.",1140998400,15,673,4.75
7995558,1,B0000A2ZQH,"I had read all the hype about this film. How shocking and disturbing it was. You have no idea what a disappointment this DVD was. Very boring. The few moments that show ""gore or violence"" are very weak, poorly shot, and the effects were cheap. You could see much more violent and disturbing things by randomly picking ANY horror film from the shelf at the video store. There is one slightly nauseating scene involving an autopsy of a supposed REAL corpse. Still I've seen worse footage of surgeries on the Discovery channel. the worst thing about this film is the footage of the REAL live cat fed to the room full of starving rats. This was out of place and totally unprofessional of the ""film makers"". And I use that term loosely. Later the same rats are set on fire. For real. Some real entertainment here, folks. If you are interested in the true war crimes of Unit 731 go read a book. Gore hounds like myself will be severly dissapointed.",1084579200,11,942,4.514619883040936
7995559,4,B0000A2ZQH,"Do not be fooled that Amazon will actually can get this dvd.  My order has been on hold for over three months and I doubt that I can ever get it from them.
Meanwhile,  this movie is a historical document of what the Japanese did to the Chinese during the wane of WW2.  ""Atrocity"" does not begin to describe the brutality of this film.  When you hear the rats squeal for the second time in this film,  even the strongest stomachs should use the fast forward feature.  Unless you REALLY hate cats and applaud deliberate animal cruelty,  for which the director was blacklisted.  The horrible thing about this movie is that these ""medical experiments"" concerning frostbite,  plague injections,  ceramic bomb tests,  death by pressure chamber,  and various murders involving babies stomped into the snow,  ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  The live vivesection is also a popcorn treat. (through research I learned that the little boy dissected alive was sold to the director by Chinese peasants who were tricked into thinking that they were supporting the revolution.
For the gore-mongers among you,  even you must beware of severe nausea.  Thank God that Ishi did not document the""Rape of Nanking""  also perpetrated by the sick Japanese of that time.  In Nanking,  live babies were thrown into the air and caught on bayonnets,  among other delightful sport.  Have fun if you dare,  but do not expect more than excuses from Amazon.",1079827200,58,1412,4.919148936170213
7995560,5,B0000A2ZQH,"Prepare to be tested to the limit. Even if you're a gore buff or a splatter/slasher/exploitation freak, this will leave you ultra disturbed!!! They say Sal and Cannibal Holocaust are cruel and vile in their display of carnage and brutality, but Men behind the sun part 1 (2 more sequels out there) is the mother of all ...forget Caligula, Guinea pigs, irreversible or any other hard to swallow flicks....this is the most cruel and disgusting film ever made, period. Now after saying this you will think that there's no point of watching this besides the gore...if you really want to learn about the japanese human experimentation during WWII...this is your best chance!!!!!",1072224000,5,673,5.017857142857143
7995561,5,B0000A2ZQH,"Warning: ultra graphic carnage, torture, violence, gore and realistic shots of dead bodies/body parts (some real) are shown in this movie. If you want to see for yourself how extreme torture and horrific human experiments got in WW2, look no further. Men Behind the Sun doesn't sugar coat anything. It goes without saying that I was pretty surprised to see this film available on amazon. As a follower of gore flicks it's safe to say that this is is about 10 times worse than Cannibal Holocaust or any of the Guinea Pig movies, and that's really saying alot. Even though it is an incredibly brutal movie, there are positive things about it too, it serves as a historical reminder of the cruelty of war. It's unbelievable what depths a country will sink to in order to gain an edge in war time. The Japanese' experiments were merciless and evil, they involved putting people in pressure chambers, freezing their limbs and then soaking them in boiling water, and other things too vile to describe. All of which is put in front of the camera to assault and disgust the viewer. The story follows a group of boys who are sent to one of these torture camps so they can be trained. The boys witness the horrors and must make up their own minds if it is right to follow in their elders footsteps. Thought provoking indeed.
So no, it's not your typical gore for the sake of gore mindless slasher pic (there is TONS of gore on display) but there is a lot to gain from watching it. Just have your seat belt fastened securely. Note: my 5 star rating is only to off set the 1 and 2 star ratings that will likely be posted due to the offensive rat scene.",1070236800,5,1640,4.451827242524917

For anybody unfamiliar with this infamous Chinese films reputation all I can say is that this could very well be the nastiest film ever made! I am in a position to say that I've seen nearly everything ""shocking"" out there, ie 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'I Spit on Your Grave', 'Emanuelle in America', 'Baise Moi', the 'Guinea Pig' series, ect and anything on the 'video nasties' list and most films that have a reputation (btw I will admit as I write this I have not yet seen 'Aftermath') and after all this I still feel that this film is the most unsettling for a number of reasons: it depicts a TRUE story, the film has an unblinking realism that is nowhere present in any other film to tackle a similar subject matter, the cruelty of the men conducting these experients illustrates the darkest side of humanity which did and I guess still does exist and lastly, this film contains the most sickening animal cruelty ever caught on film.
During WW2 Japan occupied parts of mainland China and along with the many enormous massacres and genicides the Japanese army carried out for their emporer in the true 'samurai spirit', they also conducted cruel human experiments in germ warfare research camps using Chinese and Russian civilians and POWs. If the details of these Japanese atrocities are unfamiliar to you it is not your fault, while the Japanese govourment have humbly apologised for their treatment of US and Australian POWs, they certainly lose their memory fast when it comes to the subject of war crimes aginst the Chinese, the Nanking massacre and germ warfare camps such as these. Futhermore at the end of WW2 the same red army of ""fighting Chinese allies"" quickly became a ""communist threat"" and a defeated Japan with a new found passion for car manufactor and baseball became the friend in Asia thus Western history books and school classes ignore these events aswell.
Men Behind the Sun is a film made to tell this forgotten and ignored histrocial facts and is therefore one of the most important war films out there. The director has chosen to not spare the viewer any gruesome detail and even goes so far as to secure an actuall cadaver of a young boy (the boys parents where glad to release his body as they felt the film was important for China) for a inhuman surgurey scene in the film. The director even went too far in the opions of many with a scene in which a cat is thrown into a pit with hundreds of starving rats. While I felt this scene adds nothing to the film besides extra nastyness and am myself a vegetarian and oposed to animal cruelty, I find it hard to boycott or dismiss a film soley on the basis of it comtaining animal cruelty as thousands of cows die each day for mere hamburgers that serve little more purpose than to put fat into comsumers butts.(Please note: while I have always seen no reason to disbelieve the authenticity of the cat scene as the rats are set on fire for real later in the film and of course it's no secret that dogs and cats are eaten in Asia, alot of people feel, or at least like to say, this scene is faked by smearing fake blood on the cat and later using a prop cat puppet.)
Due to the graphic nature of this film it has being long associated with the gore film genre and occasionally called ""the Cannibal Holocaust of the 80s"" and most viewers watch it simply due to its gorey reputation (I know I heard of it this way) which is good in a sense that it will live in infamy forever in horror buffs discussions and lists but not so good that most will not take it seriously. However this unbeleivably horrific film already has huge cult status and I have no doubt that future generations will appreciate it for its brutal honesty.",1064448000,37,3774,4.551470588235294
