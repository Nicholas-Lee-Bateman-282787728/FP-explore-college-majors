8575023,5,B00BXDUSKU,"The best double DVD it's been my fortune to acquire. 'The Mummy' Hammer's first,and still today the best film on Egyptian Mummy discovery on film. Peter Cushing is excellent in this exploration of greed, professional pride, and lust following the discovery and transshipment to London of an dug up Mummy. Leaves modern films in its dust.
'The Terror of the Tongs' is fascinating, mysterious and deadly in its expose of the power and terror of drug king Tong Societies in Hong Kong. Christopher Lee is unsupassed as the spider at the centre of Tong corruption, power, and sinster control over the lives of the populace.
Itcouldn't be better! Hammer does it again, producing-pre Hammer Horror days-a great film that's, all too sadly, mostly missing today. Try Amazon to obtain your copy. goes well with 'the Camp on Blood Island.",1476662400,,827,4.956834532374101
