8551016,2,B0025G40JO,"This 1964 film disappointed me greatly and I didn't like it at all, for reasons which I describe a little bit more in detail below. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

""Assassination"" was to some extent inspired by real events. Between 1858 and 1867 Japan was deeply divided between the ultra-conservative partisans of Tokugawa shogunate and the party of modernizers, which also supported the passage of power to the Emperor - this crisis was ultimately to develop into a full-scale civil war in 1868-69, followed by two smaller conflicts in 1874 and 1877. In those times lived a samurai named Hachiro Kiyokawa (1830-1864). The real Kiyokawa gained some fame for his sword fighting skills and his charisma and both sides, the party of Shogun and the party of the Emperor, tried to rally him. He was not exactly a nice guy - in 1855 he brutally murdered a man in broad daylight, on a street full of people, for a minor insult. Later, in 1860, he was behind the murder of a young American diplomat, Henry Heusken. During the crisis between the Shogun and the Emperor the real Kiyokawa switched abruptly sides a couple of times before ultimately meeting his fate in 1864...

Kiyokawa's real life was already complicated enough but the director (Masahiro Shinoda) decided to muddy things even more by a complete and deliberate chaos in narration. Because of that, as far as my personal impressions are concerned, ""Assassination"" seems to be uncertain about its target (pun very much intentional). It is so chaotic that I am unable to say what exactly this film was about! It is certainly NOT the description of a specific political plot or a specific attempt at taking somebody's life. One thing which is certain, is that in this film everybody seems to plot and prepare something - but the whole plotting doesn't seem to have ANY purpose, the story goes nowhere and there is NO clear solution to anything at the end. When the credits start rolling, we can see that a lot of things were muddled around but virtually nothing was really achieved... Oh, and by the way, the narration is absolutely not linear and there is not even one clue allowing us to figure what is the precise chronological order of things... And if you expect a devious plot and a duel of great minds between some shadowy figures, you will be very disappointed. Honestly, even of some dead bodies drop here and there, I had the impression that the only thing that got REALLY assassinated in this film was the scenario...

That were the bad news - now brace yourself for WORSE. It is not only the narration which is chaotic - the main character, Hachiro Kiyokawa, was brutally taken apart and scrambled like a pair of eggs on a hot frying pan. He is portrayed mostly as a quite extraordinary, very gifted and very complexe man (to such point that even a woman he raped idolizes him...) - but he is also such an accumulation of contradictions, that towards the end the whole thing starts to look like a surrealistic joke. At one moment he is fearless, immediately after he is a coward, at one moment he is gentle and kind hearted, in another he is sadistically vicious and brutish, at one moment he is a master of sword, immediately after he is not and therefore needs bodyguards on every walk through the city, etc. etc.

Those were worse news, now for the WORST ones. Masahiro Shinoda clearly decided from the beginning that this film will be a unique masterpiece, combining ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Rashomon"", but with an even more ambitious scenario. I know it, because (unable to understand what the movie I just watched was all about) I carefully read the booklet joined to the DVD, in which some very serious cinema critics explained, that this film was trying to show that it is almost impossible to understand another human being (as Orson Welles tried it in ""Citizen Kane"") and also that it is almost impossible to establish objective truth about anything (like in Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"") and by proving those two points it was supposedly a masterful study in nihilism.

Fine. But the big difference is, that both ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Rashomon"" are very harmonious and logical things - whereas here, all logic is abandoned. When a director willingly decides to make his main character act in every scene in total contradiction with what he was doing one minute ago, without giving any explanation why this character is acting so, well, it is not ""nihilism"" - it is called a mess. The real exploit would be to make the character act according to a logic (even if initially a deeply concealed one) and yet be extremely hard to understand - but it was clearly easier to make Hachiro Kiyokawa act like a mad man with multiple personalities (or with an army of evil twins, who impersonated him every second day of his life).

Masahiro Shinoda seemed to enjoy playing this kind fo tricks in his films, because he re-offended one year later by committing ""Samurai Spy"", a film as confused and confusing as ""Assassination"", but still a little bit better (see my review of this film). However, he certainly didn't make a masterpiece here - to my personal taste, this thing is really a disaster...

Bottom line, I was extremely disappointed with this film, I completely couldn't understand what it was about, the ending was ridiculously lame, etc. etc. I really regret that I watched it (it was only 104 minutes, but it felt three times longer) and I am certainly never going to see it again. I will not keep the DVD either. Watch at your own risk.",1365984000,2,5514,4.725571725571726
8551017,4,B0025G40JO,"Based on the historical events leading up to the Meiji Restoration(the birth of modern Japan), and a short story ""Mysterious Hachiro"" by
Ryotaro Shiba.  Hachiro is KIYOKAWA HACHIRO, a rich farmer's son who, because of family wealth, became a samurai with exceptional skill with sword, and a powerful orator and a political manipulator.  He changes his political stance so often he loses creditability and was
assassinated after a brief period of fame.  Unless you are familiar with the historical background and important events that took place in Japan during this short turbulent years(1860-1863), you might have a little problem following the plot of the film.  Because of the hero's wavering ideals, a large cast(all historically real), rather
intricate construction of the film with several clever flash-backs, you need to be very alert throughout in order to appreciate this film fully.  Well-acted(by Tetsuro Tanba as Kiyokawa, and Isao Kimura as the assassin) and well-photographed(in black-and-white), it is still a
visually and psychologically powerful film directed by Masahiro Shinoda.",1306713600,4,1097,5.544910179640719
