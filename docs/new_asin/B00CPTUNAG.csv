5733916,4,B00CPTUNAG,"Relevant to internet experiences, which could lead to harmful results for yourself and others (family).  I really appreciated how the Bible was used as a reference for the issues that arose.",1433721600,,190,5.129032258064516

5733922,1,B00CPTUNAG,"I don't care for the message it has.
I won't be watching this again",1415491200,,67,3.857142857142857
5733923,5,B00CPTUNAG,Temptation can happen so quickly when you are online or off. We have to hold steadfast to our Father in Heaven.  Enjoyed the movie,1411171200,,130,4.416666666666667
5733924,5,B00CPTUNAG,"This movie has such an incredibly great message to men. Just when you think the grass is greener..ohhhhh man, you we're sooooooo wrong. This is about a husband who made the wrong choices in reminscing with an old friend. Wait to see what happens

 B rated acting Warning:
 Whenever you purchase or download a Christian movie from Amazon, please think about the message rather than the terrible acting. I used to care so much about the acting because I would compare them to the secular movies. Don't do that with this one. Think about the message. This husband should have listened to God, but how could he?... he wasn't saved in the first place. Watch closely and God takes the scales from this mans eyes.",1405641600,,706,4.632
5733925,5,B00CPTUNAG,"When I bougtht the film, I assumed the title was about the how addictive the internet can be.  This film is not about that, at all.  It's about the ease with which people can try to rekindle old relationships in social media, and how harmful that is to current relationahips.  Even if 'nothing really happens', relationships are quickly undermined.  What looks so innocent quickly goes out of control.  It's a wake up call, necessary and relivant.",1400976000,6,447,4.828947368421052
5733954,4,B00CPTUNAG,"excellent message. good storyline, and entertaining. but there shouldn't have been any kissing. other than that, it sends a good message.",1399852800,,137,5.571428571428571
5733955,5,B00CPTUNAG,loved the message. good for entire family. arrived on time. have no regrets. highly recommend for those who enjoy family friendly product.,1399075200,,138,5.318181818181818
5733956,5,B00CPTUNAG,This is worth watching. This is especially true in the age of social networking. It is not a good idea to connect online at all with old flames if you are currently married. There are many studies on this and it always spells disaster.,1398211200,3,235,4.363636363636363
5733957,5,B00CPTUNAG,Great movie! Thoroughly enjoyed it! Good topic and plot was very good! Kept my interest will definitely reccommend this to friends!,1396051200,,131,5.285714285714286
5733958,3,B00CPTUNAG,"I chose this movie to watch with my college age daughter to expose the dangers of online relationships. Fairly predictable, but a good ""teaching"" film. I ended up losing  interest, but she, on the other hand,  who protested initially, became engrossed in the film.",1395100800,2,264,4.9772727272727275
5733959,4,B00CPTUNAG,"This was a very realistic movie. It showed how quick a little flirting with temptation can spin out of control into sin, that will take you further than you thought you'd go.",1395100800,,174,4.46875
5733960,3,B00CPTUNAG,I like Christian movies but it's hard to find movies that have great acting and this one was no different.  The story line was great but the acting and most of all the Frenchman's accent left much to be desired.,1394841600,,211,4.275
5733961,5,B00CPTUNAG,"This was an amazing movie, I enjoyed every minute! It's now one of my top favorites for sure! It's worth watching.",1394668800,,114,4.476190476190476
5733962,5,B00CPTUNAG,"These type of movies is what we need nowadays. Everybody's values have been gone and this movie reminds us what we should do. Not only are we supposed to remember the Ten Commandments, but we are supposed to live by them, every single day, and above all avoid all temptations............run away from them. Loved the movie.",1393200000,2,323,4.785714285714286
5733963,5,B00CPTUNAG,This is one of my favorite little christian movies. Helps to bring awareness to the fact that some people from your past need to stay just that - the past. It also highlights the importance of protecting your marriage - one of the most valuable institutions on earth. It is worth the watch especially for a mens group a church if you have one.,1390780800,4,343,4.375
8584791,5,B00CPTUNAG,this is such a timely movie.happens so easily.....WATCH THIS WITH UR SPOUSE.,1474416000,,76,5.416666666666667
8584792,4,B00CPTUNAG,Very Good movie. Shows what can happen when you let yourself get into a situation online (or anywhere) with someone of the opposite sex.,1469923200,,136,4.708333333333333
8584793,2,B00CPTUNAG,Good subject but not good acting.,1469750400,,33,4.666666666666667
8584794,2,B00CPTUNAG,BAD acting.  Cheesy script. But does have a solid Christian message.,1468540800,,68,5.181818181818182
8584795,5,B00CPTUNAG,"A fantastic Christian movie that all all Christian couples either married or dating should see.

I convicted me in many so many ways that I was struggling with.

I give two giant thumbs up and say it is a very recommended movie for couples young and old to watch.",1466467200,,263,4.346938775510204
8584796,5,B00CPTUNAG,"If you have had a past love, and you are married or even in a relationship, beware! Past relationships can threaten your relationship or marriage and put it and your job (perhaps) in Jeopardy if you go for it! This movie illustrates the importance of a Godly marriage and that we must keep other people from interfering! John learns the hard way that nearly cost him everything, but there are people who have been in worse trouble than him!

John suffered the loss of his job because Adrianna was the wife of one of his clients after they heard about his affair! They reach the decision to fire him as a result. Not only that, Mary's mom hires a PI to investigate the affair. He nearly loses his marriage, but they reunite at the end. It's always good to monitor our connections with the opposite sex so the relationship, engagement or marriage to our significant others won't be interfered so easy. Marriage is not only a covenant between a man and a woman, but a commitment they make before Jesus if they are believers.",1454889600,,1021,4.548913043478261
8584797,5,B00CPTUNAG,Great message and great cast.,1447459200,,29,5.0
8584798,4,B00CPTUNAG,A good film every couple should watch. Temptation is always around us.,1439424000,,70,4.916666666666667
8584799,5,B00CPTUNAG,"Great movie for those married men AND WOMEN who think they can ""just be friends"" with someone of the opposite sex.",1438128000,,114,4.476190476190476
8584800,5,B00CPTUNAG,Great movie with clear message for this internet generation.,1434412800,,60,5.777777777777778
