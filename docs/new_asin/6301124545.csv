8157686,5,6301124545,"This is one of two movies I am waiting too long for a dvd release. The other being ""THE GRANNY"".This movie was fast paced. No dull moments. Special effects were plenty. The actors were great. Add some 80`s hair chick band who seems were getting a chance to plug their song(boy I miss those days!)and let the good times roll. If anyone knows where I can get a LD quality boot until then,let me know. I have a feeling we will be waiting a while for a legit dvd release. Hell,I don`t even care if the dvd has extras on it at this point.",1401926400,,533,4.134615384615385
8157687,5,6301124545,"This flick sadly didn't recieve much attention even amongst B-movie fans, and that's a shame.  They missed out on a little gem that not only follows the schlock formula slavishly, but revels in it.  I was finally able to come across a DVD burned from the VHS on Ebay, but still wait for some corporate pencil-neck to make the obvious decision.

Vivian Lanko is an aging hollywood starlet who finances a doctor's experiments in rejuvenation.  As stubborn, impetuous, and short-sighted as Dr. Zachary Smith of Lost in Space fame, she impatiently orders the doctor (John Mackay) to use her as a guinea pig in his experiments under threat of withdrawal of her funding.  He injects her with a serum made from the brain fluid of cadavers which restores her youth - temporarily.  Unfortunately, when it wears off, she transforms into a freakish caricature of herself unless she recieves increasingly stronger doses of the serum, and they are fast running out of cadavers.

With a wonderful, low-budget ambience, the ensuing action obscures the fact that the entire story has only 4 settings:  the starlet's mansion, the doctor's hospital, a brief scene at a dockside abandoned building, and a nightclub.  This is the truest successor to ""Leech Woman"" and ""the Brain that Wouldn't Die"".  Wonderfully grisly with just the right touch of sleaze, the terrific cast smoothly brings life to the melodramatic script, the directing is at a good, steady pace right up to the end, and the camera work is never distracting, but clear and workmanlike.  And although the morbid goings-on are over the top, the film wisely keeps a straight face throughout.

Having not seen it since its release, I wondered if it would hold up today.  Upon viewing, I must say that, though not quite as well-preserved as ""Re-animator"", it is still worth owning for the B-movie afficianado.  In fact, this movie would make a great double-feature pairing with ""From Beyond"", another gruesome, sleazy B-movie about medical experiments that culminate with brain-eating.  B-movie fans everywhere owe it to themselves to track this one down; better yet, we need to demand that it get a proper release on DVD.  Try it, you may be pleasantly surprised.",1259193600,2,2206,4.9863387978142075
8157688,4,6301124545,"Lanko is terrific in this fun updating of The Leech Woman about
an aging movie queen made younger by a scientist's serum derived
from human brain fluid.  Trouble starts when the formula turns
out to have an only temporary effect and Lanko periodically
turns into a HIDEOUS hag. Great Ed French makeups and a good
cast of actors make this a FRIGHTFUL delight. Warning for
those with weak stomachs look away,for this is GROSS! I mean
it makes Lucio Fulchi and Joe D'Amato look away(o.k. Clint...Don't
get carried away) Still it is gross and wonderful. If you like
The Blob(88) and Re-Animator! See the REJUVENATOR.",1192924800,,612,4.828571428571428
8157689,4,6301124545,"Well, this is a biased and opinionated review on 80's b-flickology, but I really dug this video! It starts out with your typical sci-fi/horror setting with the anti-establishment, rogue scientist who is going against the senior scientist's wishes. The scientist, actually, a researcher who needs funding is at the mercy of an aging movie actress who wants to regain her former starlet self through his fountain of youth experimentation. Now down the corridor of horror as we are led when the experiment goes haywire and she begins turning into this brain-devouring cerebral atrocity. Sure there are cheesy parts, but the cool thing is the rock club with the group POISON DOLLYS-(by the way does anybody have any records, tapes or cd's by this group?)imagine an all-female metal band rocking! The movie pretty much has the typically predictable ending, but like I said if it's a 80's horror b-rate you want-grab your popcorn and put it in the vcr.",1032134400,3,946,4.993670886075949
