8564164,5,B00B8O4UJY,"First this is a comedy in Korean. BUT!, it also comes with some real original aspects and great acting. This is the most non violent, violent movie ever! I will not give away any of the story, ever !, this movie is in my most favorites list! It is Academy Award level. It is sub titled and I am glad. I think it is funnier with sub titles. You do need to be able to read if you do not speak Korean. I would like to say it is a feel good movie, but instead It is a movie that comes as respect to humanity in the strangest way. Seeing is believing I hope you have a chance to see this movie.",1394150400,,589,3.8360655737704916
8564165,1,B00B8O4UJY,"Poor production quality control for international usage - clicking on the subtile option in the menu just returns you every time to the install icon. Consequently, unless you speak Korean there are no other languages supported.",1383523200,,227,5.333333333333333

The product arrived exactly as described, and I appreciate how the DVD arrived sealed.  Many times when I order games of DVDs they are opened, so it's hard to believe they are new.  Thank you!",1382054400,,289,4.125
8564167,5,B00B8O4UJY,"The town of Sampo has been hit with several bank robberies. To reassure the public, recently instated police chief Lee Seung-man conducts a mock bank robbery, which is basically a pretend robber (traffic cop Jung Do-man) versus cops, that will hopefully show the efficiency of the police. Unfortunately for Lee Seung-man, Jung Do-man is dedicated to doing everything by the book and takes his role very seriously. Going by the Book is a smart, witty, and engaging heist film.

I really enjoyed the story in Going by the Book. It's a very immersive film, and it does this with it's smart and witty dialogue. The film is genuinely hilarious; it packs more laughs than most comedies nowadays, and it isn't purely a comedy film; it doesn't need gross-out gags or excessive cursing to be funny. It's a captivating film, especially how the heist plays out; the dialogue, the characters, and the twists all contribute to the excellent execution (it also has great editing). It's balanced excellently, with elements of comedy, action, and some drama all spread throughout. The fast pace makes this film the perfect time-killer. The acting is great from the entire cast. The music was also excellent.

Overall, Going by the Book is a fun, smart, and extremely entertaining heist film with memorable characters and superb acting; the perfect film to kill an afternoon. The tight direction, great editing, and smooth storytelling make this a technically amazing film, as well. As of 3/25/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is HIGHLY recommended; don't miss this South Korean gem.

Going by the Book has some violence.",1364256000,3,1640,5.044280442804428
