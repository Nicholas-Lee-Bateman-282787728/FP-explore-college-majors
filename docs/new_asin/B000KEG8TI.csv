2688648,4,B000KEG8TI,"A small Texas town begins to experience true terror as first goats are killed and then people.  Immediately, people begin thinking of El Chupacabra, the Mexican legend of the Goatsucker that drains goats of their blood.  There are several groups we see react to the terror.  We have the towns founding family, a group of teens, and some the local Mexicans.  There is a lot of anti-Mexican sentiment by some of the characters but the wisest character in the film is a Mexican vet.

Don't expect to see a whole lot of the monster.  It is quick and deadly.  The best view we get is when a bimbo tries to distract it by flashing her chest.  Although the reports say victims bodies are drained, the action shows mangling.  This monster film is framed a collection of some of the goofiest characters around.  The town's founding family is currently made up of an undertaker and his wife, their daughter, and two almost circus freak relations.  They apparently have no standing in town.  Most of the rest of the town is no better (get a load of the Sheriff and Deputy).  The only exceptions are the Mexicans.  Although looked down on by most of the town they are the most normal.  So add a monster with some reasonable effects and a Stephen King-style narration to this mix of characters and you get a pretty memorable monster flick.  Check it out.",1205280000,4,1341,4.571428571428571

8155831,1,B000KEG8TI,"An over narrated story that must be of the lowest beget.

In the small Texas town of Furlough an unseen (better that way) force is munching on goats. The son of the local vet, Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) thinks it is Chewbacca oops I mean Mexican werewolf Chupacabra that is supposed to have a hankering for cabrito. Unfortunately for the local promiscuous teens Chupacabra's dietary repertoire is expanding.

Mean time a father, Mr. Furlough, a pillar of society, has an exotic scheme to curb his daughter's wanton ways and remove the object of her lust who just happened to be Miguel.

Can the town dispatch the Chupacabra?
Will Mr. Furlough dispatch Miguel?
Will Chupacabra get his goat?

This film certainly got mine.",1508198400,,720,4.925619834710743

8155835,2,B000KEG8TI,"This movie had the works: poor acting, retched dialogue, jacked-up plot, further jacked-up subplots, eye-roll jokes, a smorgasbord of stereotypes, and scenes only as frightening as the amount of time wasted to watch them.  It's not entertaining either, which makes the movie feel twice as long as it actually is.  And if the budget were any lower, I'd think this were a family film.  As in, every one of the actors/crew is related to someone directing it.  It's less straight-to-DVD material and more October TV movie---as a parody of werewolf flicks.  Chupacabra deserves better.  It just does.  I give this movie two stars, though, because the attack scenes were plentiful (though still not great) and the monster design was. . . different.  Watch if you must, but I'd advise you rent it.",1368489600,,790,4.931818181818182
8155836,2,B000KEG8TI,"""Mexican Werewolf in Texas""

Maverick Entertainment Group
presents A Turning Point Productions  Starring Erika Fay, Gabriel Gutierrez  2007 rated probably R

With a name like this I had to buy this movie.

For some reason a werewolf has come to this sleepy town. First it kills or sucks out the blood of a herd of goats and a few humans, the usual horny teenagers making out in a goat pasture, (sure why not?)

The bodies are found and the Anglos in town blame them ""Damn Meshikins"" Aside from doing all the menial work what else do the Mexicans do? There is a cute scene when the Anglo power brokers muse that maybe the Mexicans brought this monster w/ them and maybe it will scare them back home. Cute, and a nice indictment on those powers that be; sort of a we-need-them-to-do-the-work-but-we-don't-want-them-around.

The main character is Anne and her friend Rosie who decide to catch the monster. The movie actually has the girls as the lead and I suppose a feminst might like that. Miguel, Anne's boyfriend, is the Chicano school boy who somehow got a girl but is not interested in chasing down a monster.
The town tough guy w/ the town tramp lead a group to catch the monster but lust wins out and bingo, he gets gobbled up too. All this 100 yards from the posse's bonfire and beerfest. It's not a bad scene after all.

Mexican people are portrayed in a curious duality.
There are the typical dim witted peasants, cluthcing their Bibles and beer bottles, but also several characters are educated and professional. The town veterinarian is a Chicano who seems to have a clue about life. He holds court at a local taqueria sipping beer w/ the compadres and plans strategy. They understand if whatever is killing the goats is not found Mexicans of any legality will be blamed. When humans get killed he is the calm one to add guidance to the homeboys w/ shotguns.
Maria the vet's lovely assistant is a smart confidant vet-to-be which reinforces the ""Girl Power"" feel of the movie. The ladies are the strong ones in this film. The town tramp is a blond who delivers a a credible scatterbrain  role and who provides the obligatory nudity for the R rating. (Yes, that's what sells movies).
This movie is not terrible. There are a few twists and considering the budget must have been in the pennies, production value was good.
The climax of the film is when all hell breaks loose and the girls rescue Miguel and they get into deeper trouble.",1340236800,,2442,4.621247113163972
8155837,4,B000KEG8TI,Can't go wrong with a film that's title already pays tribute to one of the greatest werewolf films of all time.  Mexican Werewolf in Texas brought the monster horror film back to the desert.  Not since the original Tremors has a film done this much to bring a local urban legend to the silver screen.  Fun solid B-Movie for a good night in.  Thank you Maverick for another gem of a film.,1288915200,3,387,4.333333333333333
8155838,1,B000KEG8TI,There is only one thing I want to know about this movie. Were the actors selected from a High School talent show play?,1273017600,,118,4.173913043478261
8155839,2,B000KEG8TI,"Okay, it wasn't that good as far as werewolf movies go, but to me the worse part of it was the actors and their accents. I don't mean to disrespect anyone with an accent, but these people sounded like they had Irish accents that were really tough to follow. I couldn't understand more than half of what they were saying. I actually believe it would have done better with subtitles.",1262649600,,381,4.457142857142857
8155840,1,B000KEG8TI,"I thought this one would hold suite to 'An American Werewolf In London"", becuz of it's title of course, but it was NO where near AAWIL, or any werewolf movie for that matter. I don't even think it was really a werewolf-It came out in the daylight.  Horror-ble!!!",1205971200,,262,4.458333333333333
