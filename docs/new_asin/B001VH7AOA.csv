They have no idea what to expect because sending a probe first would take away from the fun of discovery. Once on Venus, they encounter small rubber dinosaurs, a Venus human trap, and ""4.7 oxygen"" whatever that is. Another group goes after this one when contact is lost.

Our second group cruise the planet in a ""Supercar"" looking hover craft and mini-sub. Also on this planet is the Swedish bikini team, wearing a seashell bra and white hip hugger bells. They communicate to each by telepathy in modern English, apparently the official language of the Federation.

The dialouge left me thinking, ""huh?"" In order to hear outside they turn on the ""outside sound pick up."" Not an external microphone or sensor, because who would understand that? I would love to see a modern day Asylum sequel. Has it been too long? I mean it was over 60 years until we got the OZ prequel.
