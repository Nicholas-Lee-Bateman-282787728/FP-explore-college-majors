7873878,5,6304547412,it's a great anime it's a must to own. Too bad it didn't come in DVD.,1525219200,,69,3.375
7873879,5,6304547412,"The philosopy behind the making of this film I think is great.  The production seems limited for it's time, but the story comes from a good place.  I've read bad crits from hard core sci-fi and anime fans, and from their stand point, it is not the greatest sci-fi or ""anime"" out there, but I must say, as a film, it communicates it's idea clearly with a creative story that makes sense to the kind of world we are living in today.",1143676800,3,430,4.2317073170731705
7873880,5,6304547412,"Loved this film when I saw it on Sci-Fi and still love it. And believe it or not, the message this piece of work carries has impacted my career goals. After viewing it, I decided. naturally, to not do what humans have done in fiction & non-fiction. I chose to become a Forest Ranger and though I was impacted more along the way to be drawn to mass media/entertainment industry, that is more specifically, to become a Video Game Designer, the message has since lingered in my mind.

Now studying to work as a Video Game Designer, I believe I can further the message first provided by this great, influetial, and positive anime of Japan's.

LONG LIVE EARTH! LONG LIVE ANIME! LONG LIVE E.Y.E.S. Of Mars!",1097452800,4,700,4.5476190476190474
7873881,4,6304547412,"This movie, unlike the traditional anime, focuses on an issue that affects us all: the environment.  Although I haven't seen this movie for several years, it was my first anime and is still one of my favorites.  The  animation was not exactly up to anime standards, but what is important is  the plot of the movie.  It really touched me in a way few animes (as much  as I love them) have, and I would recommend this to anyone.",956793600,5,426,4.329113924050633
7873882,1,6304547412,"I taped this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel back when they ran ""Saturday Anime"" when I was a freshman in high school.  This film is so horrid, that I have only watched it twice in five years: my initial viewing, and 2 1/2 years later when I had to watch it to do a review for a friend's site. I hate it that much. The animation is far below average: mid 80s style but executed with no effort and with a bland colour scheme. The ""dub"" job is average for no-name and porn anime titles, so not that good.  The ""story"" is one of the most pathetic I've ever seen in a film.  In the distant past, Humans destroy their home planet Atlas from pollution, and migrate to Mars. Centuries pass and Mars is also being polluted to destruction, so a project called E.Y.E.S. is started and involves something about ESP in young girls.  A boy from some kind of resistance/migration group meets one of the girls, who it seems, is very psychic.  An older girl helps her escape (scenes involving her and the first girl have lesbian overtones and are a little uncomfortable to watch.)  The girl meets her parents in scenes that are not done very well, and a lot of forgettable stuff happens before Mars starts destroying itself.  Everyone flees into space arks, but it's too late and everybody dies, with the girl's parents stranded in space, waiting for their impending, slow death (yeah, sure this is appropriate for kids.)  Suddenly, the spirits of everyone appear and then possess the already-existing Neanderthals on Earth.  The End.
I put 'anime' in quotations because this early 90s title is not listed in the 2000 edition Anime Encyclopedia (a must have for anime fans.)  It's possible that this was a production funded by the Japanese government (it's been done before,) during the environmentalism craze of the late 80s/early 90s, which would also explain a lot concerning it's quality.
As far as I can see (and I'm pretty good at these,) there is no Biblical symbolism, unless your edition of the Bible has new age, psychic mysticism and juvenile environmental messages.
To put it bluntly, this movie really, really [...stinks].  Only submit to your kids if they did something bad, because they'll see it as punishment, and hate you for making them watch it.  If you want your kids to watch an animated movie with an environmental message, get ""Fern Gully,"" a far better film.  I hate this movie more than any other, except for ""Fantastic Planet,"" but that one is for more personal reasons.  Just don't buy it, okay.",943920000,6,2503,4.671981776765376
7873883,5,6304547412,"This movie was wonderful! I saw it a few years ago on the sci-fi channel, and then I stumbled upon it here and I just had to write a review. I don't care about artistic technique or what's anime and what's not, I care about  content. This had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it gives  a valuable lesson any child should learn at an early age; that it's wrong  to pollute and corrupt a planet. It's a good plot, too, about a young girl  in a school for psychics that is completely shut off from the horrors of  mars on the rest of the planet.",943920000,6,558,3.990990990990991
7873884,5,6304547412,Their is no anime movie you would want to see than  E.Y.E.S. of Mars. It shows NR-rated content thats fun for the whole family. E.Y.E.S. of Mars is nothing more than a wonderful movie everyone should see. E.Y.E.S. of Mars is  one of animes best films. If you want to experience true anime the E.Y.E.S.  of Mars is a great place to start watching.,919814400,2,346,4.375
