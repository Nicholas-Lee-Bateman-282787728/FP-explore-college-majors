8099175,5,B000CL9G0M,"What a great pity that this unparalleled documentary series, was never issued in America, in both US region VHS and subsequently, DVD Region 1. It was first shown in the UK, on the BBC T V, in 1977. I bought it in both formats. The style of narration and informative detail, is so good and compelling, due to a high degree of personal input, by those who took part in this highly secretive work, and fortunately for us,were still alive at that time. The original series on VHS was in 6 parts, but a 7th programme ''Battle of the Atlantic'' was made some time after the original 6, and added to the VHS edition when released. This added a extra 50+mins. Each episode concentrates on a particular area of scientific break-through's, that gave each side a huge but temporary advantage--be it RADAR, and all it's counter measures ,on both sides. Or Jet propulsion and Rocket development. etc etc. Although since the 1970's, much new material of a secret nature has now been made available , the presentation and great material shown here, will induce the viewer to take many a re-run, of this deadly silent secret war, not known to the public at that time, and much is still a secret even now.  PS  if you have a multi region player, or Desk Top, this great series is still available on DVD at Amazon UK. OR-- gain an extra episode and buy this VHS.
