Cinderella: The Princes Side of the Story
Red and Little Boy Blue are playing some music together when Little Boy Blue suddenly disappears! This is just like when Cinderella left the ball without finishing her dance. To solve the mystery, Super Why and his friends soar into Cinderellas fairytale once again, and this time they talk to the prince!

Snow White
The super fun Storybrook Carnival is in town, and Princess Pea is enjoying lots of yummy treats until she gets a terrible tummy ache! When Goldilocks offers her some popcorn, Princess Pea knows she should refuse, but she really wants to eat just a little. The Super Readers fly into the story of Snow White as the wicked queen tempts the fairytale princess with that infamous apple. Will the Super Readers be able to stop Snow White from taking the bait before Snow White ends up with something much worse than a stomachache?

The Prince and the Pauper
Whyatt thinks his house is too loud while Princess Pea believes her home is too quiet! Would the friends be better off if they switched places? To look for a solution, Super Why and his friends encounter two friends just as they are about to switch houses. A prince on the farm and a pauper in a castle soon leads to chaos and confusion! Where will everyone be the happiest?

The Boy Who Cried Wolf
When Baby Joy says her first words, Whyatt is the only one around who hears her. The problem is that now he cant convince anyone that she actually talked. The Super Readers fly into the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf to help that boy convince people that his wolf tale is true. Whyatt figures out a strategy for getting his family to believe that what he said  and Baby Joy said  really happened.

Cinderella
Red, whos not a princess, is worried about fitting in at Sleeping Beautys princess party. The Super Readers leap into the book of Cinderella to see how she handled her own princess problem. When the clock strikes twelve, Red learns that she doesnt need the help of a fairy godmother to feel good about herself.
