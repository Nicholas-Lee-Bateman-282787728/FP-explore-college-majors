8036239,2,B0005GFQTO,"If it wasn't for the short ab workout at the end of this DVD, it would have received 1 star.  I'm a huge fan of Leslie Sansone's Walking program.  I own about 20 of them.  I'm 45 years old and I do a workout every day to stay in shape.  But this DVD is very poor quality and there's no excuse for it.  You can just barely hear the music so it's impossible to stay in step and the volume wavers and it just becomes annoying.  This DVD would have went into the trash long ago but for the ab workout at the end.  The ab workout is about 10 minutes long but she does some pretty intense moves including the reverse crunches.  When I first bought this DVD, about 5 years ago, I hadn't done an ab workout before and I struggled with those reverse crunches.  Now I have some of Leslie's ab workouts on other DVD's and I've gotten much stronger.  I can get through this 10 minute ab workout without difficulty now but if I really work it, I can still start to feel that burning by the end.  Now I just fast forward through the walking workout and do the ab workout - I add it to the end of some of the other walking DVD's for a little extra ab work.  So my recommendation is to stay clear of this DVD, it's junk.  You can find better walking workouts and ab workouts on her other DVD's.",1441843200,,1278,4.043824701195219

8036242,1,B0005GFQTO,I couldn't do this video for more than 2 minutes because I couldn't hear the background music. I personally need to the music to keep the pace and I don't know of any other of her DVDs where you don't have music. I think it was there but so very very faint that it wasn't audible to viewers just to the cast. BORING!!,1198195200,4,317,4.0476190476190474
8036243,4,B0005GFQTO,"The Morning Mile Plus Abs partners with The Evening Mile Plus Legs as the SUN AND MOON set. Each walk is one mile in length. However this set NEVER was released on DVD according to the folks at lesliesansone.com. Neither walk is on DVD. They are available only on VHS.

The walk is a nice one. Leslie leads 6 other exercisers in one brisk mile of walking. Simple steps, marches, side steps, gentle kicks. Typical Leslie fare. At the end of the tape she leads you through 10 minutes of ab exercises.

The tape is great if you are short on time or just need a quick mile!",1109635200,10,569,4.2592592592592595
