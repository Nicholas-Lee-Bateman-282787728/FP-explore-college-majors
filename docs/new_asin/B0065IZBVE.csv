8493468,5,B0065IZBVE,"This animated comedy series is the follow-up to Total Drama Island.  Fourteen Canadian teens are sent to a dilapidated film-lot to compete for $1 million in a send-up of Survivor.  Each week, they compete for invincibility in challenges based on movie genres (sci-fi, superhero, heist, fairy tale, etc.).  Those who survive are gifted with a Golden Chris Award at the elimination ceremony, while the competitor unlucky enough to be voted off takes a walk down the red carpet and gets driven away in the lame-ousine.  As before, the action is shared between the challenges, the competitors' downtime and their confessionals (this time in the make-up trailer).  Interspersed with the actual competition are episodes of Total Drama Aftermath, where the hosts comment on the latest action and the losers share their stories.

The characters are the same as before - 22 teens plus host Chris McLean and his sidekick Chef Hatchet - though many of the teens didn't make the cut for the competition and so start the series on Total Drama Aftermath.  As you might expect, the strongest characters make it to the competition, but this time there is more of a focus on characters that didn't get much of a run in the first series, notably Harold, Justin, Beth and Lindsay.

Good points:
- This is even funnier than Total Drama Island and the challenges are even more ridiculous.
- Chris is even more vain and self-absorbed than before.  Love the costumes!
- Character development.  Lindsay discovers assertiveness, Justin discovers that his looks aren't always the answer, enemies learn to appreciate each other and Chris and Chef discover how much they mean to each other.
- Izzy/E-Scope's smackdown with Chef.
- The sharks.
- The ending.  Nice guys don't always finish last.

Not-so-good points:
- I'm not sold on Total Drama Aftermath.  It does provide the occasional laugh, but for me it breaks up the flow of the competition without providing much that's worthwhile in return.

Bad point:
- Courtney.  Ick!  At least Chris gets his own back at every opportunity.

I do like the animation, especially the character designs, but it's the voice actors who are the real stars here.

Where's the merchandising for this series?  I want my own Golden Chris Award.",1331596800,4,2250,4.952
