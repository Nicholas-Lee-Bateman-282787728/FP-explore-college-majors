8473877,2,B005HVWVX6,It was kind of like a student movie. The acting was a little overdone but it was interesting. I wouldn't really reccomment it.,1364169600,,126,4.521739130434782
8473878,1,B005HVWVX6,"I got suckered - I'm naive about reviews apparently.
NOW, after paying my money and trying to wait this one out, I am re-reading the reviews and its clear they are planted.

First, despite the cover art, this movie's in black and white.
NOT a problem.
BUT, the cast consists (1/2 way through) of a Russel Brand wanna-be, a pseudo David Hyde-Pierce, an close-your-eyes-and-its-John-Cleese, and other English stereotypes.
A poor script, marginal acting and handheld camera work.

Mind, I *adore* Python, AND black humor, but this is just so poor.
I may hav given this another star if I were not so pissed about the planted reviews.
Wait till its in the Prime que.",1363392000,,661,4.7894736842105265
8473879,5,B005HVWVX6,"So, we were browsing our favorite and very insightful movie review site, Filmbalaya.com, and in looking for a comedy saw the review on The Drummond Will. My husband and I just loved it, full of one surprise after another, murderously funny and now I am buying another one for a friend. Every time it is loaned out it is returned with rave reviews! It has subtle Monty Python type humor influences throughout. If you love anything with great humor and a bit on the dark side, go for it. Hint: Watch the credits till they are all done. It is a movie not in the Hollywood mainstream, but discover this film, you won't regret it.",1337990400,,625,4.443478260869565
8473880,5,B005HVWVX6,"I cannot praise The Drummond Will too highly. Shot in black and white it is in the very best traditions of understated British humour with some wonderfully laid back performances. The script borders on genius at times. A bumbling English country copper, a wonderfully camp vicar, and an array of eccentric village characters that would do an Ealing comedy proud are laid out in a loose murder mystery plot. With some marvellous cinematography it deserves a much wider showing. An absolute delight.",1317600000,,497,5.073170731707317
8473881,5,B005HVWVX6,"'The Drummond Will' is pure enlightened British comedy that lands somewhere between Monty Python's zaniest and the darkness of 'Fargo,'. Estranged brothers, Danny and Marcus, meet up in their hometown Yorkshire village to bury their father. The witty repartee of this farcical comedy kicks off with the innocent comment, ""A pint...what's the worst that could happen?'

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drummond-Will/dp/B005HVWVX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drummond Will</a>The brothers find that their father left them a house and an unaccounted for sizeable amount of cash. The fun begins when they realize that someone else wants that cash and is willing to kill for it. Marcus' droll personality and sense of understatement soon had us laughing out loud. Like a great cult classic, `The Drummond Will' gets funnier and funnier upon repeated viewings. Five stars = great fun.",1316476800,,915,6.038461538461538
8473882,5,B005HVWVX6,"Was lucky to discover this indy gem at the Film Festival circuit this year...loved, loved, loved it.  I found myself chuckling at the most crazy, absurd circumstances.  It's a smart, laugh-out-loud comedy and was thrilled to see The Drummond Will making it to DVD.  Will be a fine addition to my DVD collection right there with my other fave comedies:  The Wedding Crashers, Something About Mary, Caddyshack to name a few.  Enjoy the show!",1316131200,2,439,4.878378378378378
