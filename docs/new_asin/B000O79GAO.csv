8184033,3,B000O79GAO,Ordered this to replace a prior copy that had been lost at a venue.  For a simple set of visuals that will loop on the cheap this is a fair value.  I would actually prefer the mixing be set to a slightly lower bpm and the visuals be a bit darker but this is much better than the other cheap DVD's you see on here and provides a good length of footage.,1413763200,,351,3.861111111111111

8184035,3,B000O79GAO,"this was not bad, but it could have been better.  the visual aspect of this film was a bit lacking.",1392249600,,99,3.95
8184036,5,B000O79GAO,"I didn't think I would enjoy this DVD as much as I did.  I prefur the more dated looking computer graphics that were used at raves in 1992 however the content of this DVD is actually quite dated in its own right.  These graphics were exactly the sort of stuff I saw in the mid to late 90s at such events.  As a result this is instant nostalgia.  The speed of the graphics are not really fast enough for jungle and happyhardcore so I would say this material is more suited to house and detroit techno.  The content mainly consisted of swirling CG clouds, rudimentary CG lava/fire effects, and twisting geometric shapes.  Not bad at all and a nice first DVD to play on my new HDTV.  I expect to get many hours of enjoyment with this disk as I listen to my favorite bedroom DJs.  Thanks to the publishers for releasing this great product!",1297900800,10,835,4.341935483870968
