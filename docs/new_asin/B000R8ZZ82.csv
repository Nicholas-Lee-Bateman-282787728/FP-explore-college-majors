8199528,5,B000R8ZZ82,Gabe Suarez is an innovator and a very thoughtful instructor.  He does not take anything for granted.  He tests theory's instead of just accepting old repeated doctrine.  He is very practical.  He has a very good sense of humor.  He makes training fun.,1404000000,,252,4.767441860465116
8199529,5,B000R8ZZ82,I didn't even buy this. but as far as I know he has no problems with this thing. probably really enjoyed it I bet.,1390608000,,114,3.7916666666666665
8199530,1,B000R8ZZ82,"What a load of load of crap.  I'm sending this one back.
It's great if you're some armchair warrior idiot who watches too much TV.
Instead of wasting your money on this tripe - Check out Clint Smith's
Thunder Ranch videos.  This DVD is strictly for wannabe's!!!",1356825600,2,261,4.531914893617022
8199531,5,B000R8ZZ82,"Excellent dvd.  This goes great with the book to actually show the techniques and how to perform them.  The dvd doesn't cover every scenario that someone could face, but it does give you useful information to solve the problem should it arise.  This dvd doesn't replace actual training, but is a good reference to have around to refresh your memory.",1334188800,,349,4.783333333333333
8199532,5,B000R8ZZ82,"Unlike so many other things these days labeled ""tactical"", this video is truly about tactics.  And in the real fight, tactics are often more important than skills or ""tactical"" gear.

Much cheaper than taking a class, The Tactical Advantage video demonstrates many things that the book could not.

If you buy the video, I would suggest also buying the book.  Some of the best money I have ever spent.",1320192000,3,400,4.753623188405797
