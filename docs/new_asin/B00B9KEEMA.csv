5564538,3,B00B9KEEMA,"I thought this might be another documentary to help provide running inspiration to a new runner.  There is a small segment of his running career, but not enough to motivate.",1373241600,,173,4.766666666666667
5564539,2,B00B9KEEMA,good!,1444953600,,5,5.0
5564540,3,B00B9KEEMA,Shots of running trails are great. But we learn very little about Marco and why he runs. His wife seems to be an amazing support to himvut he seems oblivious to the toll his running takes on her.,1442016000,,195,4.157894736842105

5564542,1,B00B9KEEMA,"The movie may be fine, but I was under the impression that it could be downloaded for offline viewing later (in this case, a cross-country flight). Amazon's help pages need to be a little more clear about this process. Fortunately I'm only out $2.",1437177600,,247,4.636363636363637
5564543,1,B00B9KEEMA,Sorry. Just boring. I couldn't find any reason to care about this mans fading abilities.,1435190400,,88,4.933333333333334
5564544,3,B00B9KEEMA,Difficult to follow somewhat because of poorly written subtitles. Still deciding whether to watch the whole thing.,1432252800,,114,5.764705882352941
5564545,4,B00B9KEEMA,"The feats of Marco Olmo were amazing.  However, the movie could have been organized better.  It was somewhat confusing.  I am glad we watched it, but think it's production could be improved.",1431820800,,190,4.875

5564548,1,B00B9KEEMA,It does not bring the subtitles in Spanish. In his page it puts: subtitles in Spanish. When they bandage some article make sure themselves that everything is correct,1392681600,,165,4.928571428571429
8564658,1,B00B9KEEMA,"Disappointing that I was supposed to get the ""English version"" according to the picture as it had the American and UK flag. But I didn't get that. It was in foreign languages, mostly French and Italian, and had no subtitles. Aside from that, there were a couple of sentences in English in the beginning, so I thought that maybe only the intro was foreign language. Nope. The whole thing. What a waste of time! The movie was not inspiring as I had no idea what was going on other than piecing together what I was watching. No idea why he had taped his leg, no idea what kind of tape he used, and the movie explained nothing about his training. Seems about the quality you'd expect from a Youtube video long shot by volunteers. While Marco Olmo is probably a great guy and a great ultra runner, I was very disappointed in the movie. And, I have done ultra marathons in mountains like the movie shows. So I know what I am talking about!",1488585600,,933,4.367816091954023
8564659,1,B00B9KEEMA,Terrible,1476576000,,8,8.0
8564660,1,B00B9KEEMA,The movie wasn't very well done. SUPER low budget. And subtitles aren't the worst thing in a movie but it doesn't say ahead that the whole movie is in Italian ando sub titled,1473724800,,174,4.303030303030303
8564661,1,B00B9KEEMA,Worst documentary I have ever seen. Appears to be a compilation of home videos. What is he doing? What race it is? I wish I knew - the narration was maybe five minutes spread around the duration of the movie. Spare yourself 48 minutes.,1469145600,,235,4.363636363636363
8564662,5,B00B9KEEMA,Excellent movie for all runners. Insightful and inspiring to see Marco face his limits and continue to push them.,1465776000,,113,5.0
8564663,5,B00B9KEEMA,Amazing person! Inspirational to see the dedication and humility from such a gifted athlete.,1464566400,,92,5.642857142857143
8564664,2,B00B9KEEMA,I kept waiting for the movie to get interesting.  It never did.  Music was distracting.  Saw more of his wife than him.  No story.,1460764800,,130,4.291666666666667
8564665,5,B00B9KEEMA,Extraordinary story about an extraordinary man.  Exceptionally well done and inspiring documentary.  The best that I've seen in a long time.,1460160000,,140,5.619047619047619
8564666,4,B00B9KEEMA,"This is a great story about a regular guy that works a regular job who happens to run mountains in his spare time. He also happens to be (or used to be) one of the best ultrarunners on the planet. It's an inspiring story about a guy who just ran, and in his 50s and 60s, ran faster, farther and higher than kids half his age. If you like stories that push the boundaries of what most people think is possible, or you're an ultrarunner already, you'll like this. It's not a blockbuster story, it's just about a guy, but he's an inspiring guy.",1452902400,,541,4.211538461538462
8564667,5,B00B9KEEMA,"Any one who would say this documentary is boring or otherwise ""not good"" is simply not a runner and could not understand. This was an excellent peek into a solid runner's mindset and a great depiction as to why someone would continue in ultra running for a lifetime. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",1446681600,,289,4.686274509803922
