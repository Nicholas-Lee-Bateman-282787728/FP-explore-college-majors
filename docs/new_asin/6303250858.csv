7841729,5,6303250858,"Arrived on time, well packaged, and as expected. I use this movie to accompany the book in the college classroom. It's completely different from the book as far as characters, and the setting looks to be 1940s not 1990s, when the film supposedly took place. It is slow paced, psychological, and most of today's students are not familiar with the actors, so it makes for a nice film analysis project. Other than that, dark, deep, and dreary.",1432512000,,440,4.7272727272727275
7841730,4,6303250858,"No adaptation of any great novel will be as good as the book, and there will be big changes, for a variety of reasons, BUT...
This movie, first of all, should not be compared to the book.  Watch it as if Camus had never written his story.  (But definitely read the book too)  Hurt does a great job and Raul Julia is terrifying.  The way the priest dies is an interesting departure from the book (he descends into hades!).  The death of the poor choir boy in the movie is terribly moving and heart-wrenching (and brings to mind Ivan Karamazov's anger at an unjust God).  I was happy to find this-- I always knew this book would make an interesting film adaptation.",976406400,10,663,4.39344262295082
7841731,5,6303250858,"THE PLAGUE, as in her  other 30+ films, is a showcase  for the talent and  depth of Sandrine Bonnaire. In Camus' novel the character Raymond Rambert  (journalist) is portrayed on screen by  Sandrine Bonnaire as Martine  Rambert (tv journalist). Camus' existential questions are therefore  answered  from the feminine point of view, which, in itself, is  revolutionary though this fact  went unnoticed in reviews.  Mlle. Bonniare  is the center of the film as in her whole career, she has gone from  strength to strength and is posiblecy the world's greatest actress.",968198400,,566,5.155555555555556
7841732,3,6303250858,"Others compare this movie to one of the 5 best literary works of the past century. To them it looks weak. In that context they are right.
In itself, this movie still asks ""the"" questions of the century  --the ones we have chosen to forget. If you are not utterly dead to the  savage indifference of life, this ""just ok"" movie of a classic  book will move you.",934416000,4,359,4.25
7841733,4,6303250858,"The Plague paints a haunting picture of an outbreak in a South American city, with the fallout affecting characters across the spectrum of life.  Although nowhere near a perfect adaptation of Camus' masterpiece, it has an  energy of its own, with a good international cast and a haunting  soundtrack.  Those expecting a slavish adaptation of the book will be  disappointed.  Those interested in a flim-maker's interpretation, with a  late-Twentieth Century update, will be rewarded.",932169600,6,482,5.4324324324324325
7841734,2,6303250858,"I enjoyed the book, so I thought I'd give the movie a chance when it came to cable.  Would Hollywood be able to give a sympatheic rendering of the philosophical novel? They tried, but they just couldn't cut it.  I can live  with the change of era and continent, but the Hollywood actors they brought  in just weren't what I envisioned for the roles.  Especially Hurt as Reiux.  The story--and its ideas--really do require the internal monologue of the  novel's narrator.  The actors just couldn't bring Camus' ideas to life.  Without being able to do that, the whole thing seemed dreary and pointless.  I think another, non-Hollywood cast and production team could have done  better.",930182400,6,683,4.852173913043479
