6923392,5,B00R8ZFVBS,"I would not consider this a Sign Language film. it is the director's lens which brings the audience into viewing a reality which brings us into a world that is different than our own. the emotion of the film is what makes us feel so connected to the characters. even though we are  always at a distance, as the camera like a voyeur is standing back, across the street, in the back of a room, clearly we can not enter this reality fully through language, however, here we are as an audience fully emotionally involved, this film is truly an experience it is not something which you find yourself just merely watching it is a story you enter with your eyes and then the visceral reactions which follow.",1448755200,6,700,4.46875

In post-screening dialogue at the Crested Butte Film Festival 2015, another audience member suggested that The Tribe evokes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies/dp/B001K2DIME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies</a>. That might be a most apt analogue. What consumed me was the question of why my response to The Tribe differed from my years-ago response to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B005T3AYAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>. One guess: Pulp Fiction is animated by aurally unchallenged, articulate, self-aware monsters. The words of Jules and VincentAw, man, I shot Marvin in the face! as if hed merely spilled a glass of milkframe their decisive brutality so we rapidly recover from witnessing it. The dialogue in The Tribe might crackle just as well, but those of us who do not sign do not know. The Tribe is one of the most visually dependent films you will ever watch. Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy offers us no subtitles or voiceover, and uses no score or even a track of bassy, rumbling menace. He need not. The only sound we hear is of the action, including the tapping and slapping of the sign language dialogue as it frames and punctuates one long wrenching shot after another. The only sustained sound of the human voice we hear is the sobbing agony of Anna (Yana Novikova) in a scene that left me gasping. With no spoken words to bend its brutally blue and red light, The Tribe sears us.

In the post-screening dialogue, rapporteur Jack Hanley suggested spaghetti Western as a genre for The Tribe. Hes on to something. The film opens by following Sergey (Grigoriy Fesenko) into town, a Ukrainian boarding school for the deaf. Through distant shots that make him seem smaller than he is, we see Sergey assimilate into the schools gang culture of crime and subsequently assume the role of pimp in a lorry yard a brief drive from the school, where several of the films turning points form. Later attracted to Anna in a way that disrupts the gangs businessand perhaps saturated by the duplicity of the schools official enablers of crimeSergey turns on them and the student gang bosses, exacting macabre revenge, apparently after himself being killed. In the final scenes of retribution, he seems physically larger, laconicthats not ironicand brutally methodical.

Women in the CBFF audience expressed a view that Slaboshpytskiys depiction of women in the film is horrible. It might be more accurate to say that the treatment of the two main women, Anna and Svetka (Rosa Babiy), is horrible. Upon Sergeys arrival at the school, we see two favorable views of women, the first of the principal (Tatiana Radchenko) handling an all-students ceremony in the courtyard and then managing a flow of visitors in her office with executive comportment. The second is of a history teacher (Ludmila Rudenko) in a subsequent class session, in which her authoritative poise manages a male student troublemaker (Alexander Dsiadevich). Yet the timekeeping bell, which in this school is a flashing lamp on the front wall of the classroom, interrupts her. The overarching system defeats an otherwise strong woman in a way that is utterly ordinary to the context. From then, the indignities of Anna and Svetka are the only way we see the women of The Tribe. The single moment of joy we notice, as Jack Hanley mentioned, is their possibility of a trip to Italy from snow-packed Ukrainebut for the purpose of extending their prostitution across national lines.

So the American women in the CBFF audience have a point about the grim circumstances of the Ukrainian women in The Tribe. Perhaps inconsistently with a spaghetti Western theme, Annas experiences are pivot points in the story, none of them liberating. She moves from being a prostitute to the lorry drivers, and then to Sergey; and then to being his lover, with a difficult consequence that only a woman fully understands; and then to being Sergeys victim after all that she had already endured. Yana Novikovas work as Anna earned her the CBFFs Special Jury Award for Outstanding Debut Performance for her astonishing and courageous turn in The Tribe. Now, dare to consider this possibility: that her best workand that of Slaboshpytskiy and all the others of The Tribeis still ahead of them. I like the sound of that future, with or without subtitles or voiceover.",1446249600,15,4483,5.248256624825663

6923428,2,B00R8ZFVBS,"The film is arresting and inherently cinematic: no dialogue, no subtitles, no narration, and a story featuring deaf characters in a shocking and compelling narrative.  The uncompromising technical premise forces viewers to pay attention in ways films with dialogue do not.  Yes, it's pure cinema -- but that's not enough.  Miroslav Slaboshpitsky never lets us get close enough to the characters or see them as anything but base, criminal and brutal.  I felt like I was in a zoo, and staring in long take after long take at creatures who were nothing more than their appetites.  This is not a fault of the (non-professional) actors or of the story, it's a failure of vision by a director who seemed to think his premise was excuse enough to make the film, and never allowed his characters to get past two dimensions.",1467849600,,815,4.792857142857143

6923434,3,B00R8ZFVBS,Interesting movie using only sign language. Thankfully it has Closed Captions since I don't sign. It's a heavy and dark movie about the angst of deaf young people but it does give insight into their struggles.,1458864000,,209,4.833333333333333
6923435,5,B00R8ZFVBS,"WE TEND to crave dramas that bring us right into the heart of the action: close to the players, cheek-to-cheek with the lover, toe-to-toe with the fighter, face-to-face with the victim.

The payoff from them is immediate: We get a jolt, an emotional high, a moment of cathartic release. We're then free to disengage from the movie and go on with our lives.

Then, there are works such as ""The Tribe,"" a stunning examination of teenage cruelty, exploitation and crime that refuses to give us the satisfaction of identifying with the characters.

Unnerving, radically uncomfortable to watch - especially for those brought up on Hollywood fare - Ukrainian writer-director Miroslav Slaboshpitsky's feature debut uses a dizzying array of devices to force us to witness the story's thicket of bewildering events and tragedies from a great distance.

Set at an underfunded, bleak boarding school for the deaf that's controlled by a gang of vicious teenage bullies, ""The Tribe"" unfolds entirely through sign language.

There are no subtitles. The only way we can tell what the cast of nonprofessional actors is saying to each other is to interpret the action and emotional context.

We enter this harsh environment through new student Sergey (Grigoriy Fesenko), a stoic teen beset by the gang from the moment he enrolls. He is put through a hazing ritual and inducted into the tribe's way of life - robbing townsfolk, dealing drugs and forcing the female students into prostitution.

If the language barriers weren't enough, ""The Tribe"" alienates the viewer further through its camera work: While a typical American blockbuster crams in dozens of close-ups into a single minute, Slaboshpytskiy's film features virtually none.

Instead of rapid rock-and-roll zooms and edits, the camera is stationary, capturing the scenes in long takes shot from a considerable distance.

""The Tribe"" has no soundtrack music. The fights are realistic, awkward and short-lived, and the criminal acts so matter-of-fact, they are all the more chilling.

The story line is pointedly predictable and sleazy: Sergey is accepted by the tribe but manages to retain his capacity for love and compassion, traits his fellow thugs cannot tolerate.

Slaboshpitsky seems to be telling us that working-class youth in today's Ukraine have little choice but to live predictable, sleazy lives.

""The Tribe"" is relentless, and at 132 minutes, it can be an ordeal. This is not exactly a fun movie.

Like a production by the great Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht, ""The Tribe"" doesn't allow us the relief of catharsis. We must think our way through it, to reflect on the social reality it captures.

Embrace it as a great work of political critique, or reject it as a form of aesthetic bullying; there's no denying ""The Tribe"" is a powerful provocation.",1458345600,4,2808,5.142857142857143

Demands careful attention in this way, and (of course) because theres no speaking or subtitles at all.

Exploitative, as contrived in its grimness as the worst Disney pap is in its saccharine optimism, this film had critics falling all over it for its ""bold"" lack of dialogue, subtitles, and music. Wow, dude.  The director is not deaf.  Where the hell is the outrage from the hearing-impaired community? I used to TEACH dozens of mainstreamed deaf and hearing-impaired college students and the vast majority were happy, well adjusted, wonderful kids.

Fesenko said he used to fantasize about the deaf school across the street from his as a kid. THIS is what he came up with?  What if he did the same with an Islamic school? a Hebrew school?  EVERY one here is a thug, a pimp, a whore, a drunk, a bully, or worse?

Oh yeah, and the sex scenes -- and I'm NO prude -- are wholly gratuitous and borderline pedophilic.

This movie was like watching Director Larry Clark's ""Kids"" with a bit of Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" thrown in at the end.  I see that someone mentioned not to watch it alone, or with children.  I would never even think to let a minor watch this one, but I think most people will agree that it's not scary in a horror genre way.  You definitely can watch it alone.

8694619,3,B00R8ZFVBS,"This movie was purchased so that my wife and I could watch something on neutral territory. (We speak two different languages and I thought to find a film that was neither in English nor in Chinese. This film was that.)

There was just too much about this film that was implausible.

1. Where were the teachers?
2. After the first death, where were the police?
3. Why did nice looking young, well-fed girls need to work as prostitutes by night and students by day?
4. What was the mechanism of action of a lot of the criminal activity? (It was something that it would not have been all that easy to figure out even with subtitles. It was impossible to figure out with nothing to guide us at all.)
5. If one of the hooker girls wanted to take a man, why wasn't it with the alpha male leader? (That's kind of what it means to be a pimp. You trick out the girls of your stable for some part of the day and then use them for your own purposes when you want them. And the having a stable of ""women"" also means that you have more than 2.)
6. From the movie, we are meant to deduce that the 2 girls (and let's emphasize that there were only 2, which is not even a decent size stable, and not nearly enough to employ nearly as many guys as were involved in this setup) were enough to take some number of guys over to Italy to pimp 2 (count them, 2) girls? And there were only 2 girls in the whole school. And it seems like every student in the school was part of the gang (except the one boy who was on the outside. And everyone was cruel to him for some inexplicable reason.)
7. A girl works as a professional sex worker and ends up pregnant just the same? (It is commonly known that sex workers are actually *less* likely to have STDs and end up pregnant than normal people in the street.)
8. Did these kids have any parents?

There were some other problems:

1. There were no devices to let us know the rate at which time was passing. That would have been helpful.
2. There was no good way to separate all of the criminal activity. (What were these guys? Thieves? Or pimps? Or dope dealers? As a rule, pimps don't sell dope.)
3. What was the beginning? What was the end? Some kids are in the boarding school, but are they well to do enough to pay for it? Or was the state the entity that paid their tuition? And then someone walks into unlocked rooms and just murders four sleeping people, but then what?
4. The movie was just a bit too graphic. The abortion scene was what put me over the top. (I could not bring myself to watch it all the way through. With all this money coming in from this huge criminal enterprise, they couldn't find enough to take the girl to some decent clinic to have a chemical abortion? (When you have very early abortions, it can be done by chemical means and not by D&C and it's not much different to a menstrual period.)
5. No dialogue=No names and therefore no way to reference characters. My wife and I were making up names (in both English and Chinese) from the beginning to identify characters. New Boy. Bad Boy. Big Boss. Second in Command.

I also wonder why was it that it had to be a criminal syndicate in a school for the deaf? Why wouldn't it be at any other school? Why would it be in a school at all?  If this was a school for hearing people, can you imagine a criminal syndicate like one shown in this movie?

After you take away the young, attractive lithe white bodies (that work very well in the graphic sex scenes) and the novelty of the fact that there are no words in this film, what do you have? Not all that much, as it turns out.

A film that did a much better treatment of deaf people--if that's what you can call this movie-- was made many decades ago.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-Of-A-Lesser-God-1986/dp/B00BTYHBX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children Of A Lesser God (1986)</a>

Verdict: Not recommended. There was some fun in trying to deduce what was going on, but still not enough to save the movie/ make it worthwhile/ worth recommending. Ebert at the movies blowtorched this film, and they did a much better job of it than even what I did. That review is worth checking out.",1507939200,,4184,4.395348837209302
