7986397,4,B00008QSAE,A magnificent performance of a work that I do not like very much. It has nothing to do with a Requiem and it is not very christian either,1447718400,,137,3.9285714285714284
7986398,5,B00008QSAE,"A beautiful DVD.  The setting, the musicians, and the conductor are excellent.  Thank you.",1445644800,,90,5.357142857142857
7986399,5,B00008QSAE,"There are not so many Ein deutsches Requiem out there, on blu-ray. Its hard to find any better reading of the work than by Christian Thielemann. Recorded at Mnchner Philharmonie, Gasteig Kulturzentrum 2007, I am amazed by the excellent sound, demonstration quality indeed! Also the lighting is remarkably tasteful, far away from the a bit dull lightning we see in so many concerts.
Great singing by soprano Christine Schfer and baritone Christian Gerhaher, together with Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks.
A treasure to own, this blu-ray with Brahms longest and problably most touching composition!",1425600000,7,595,5.408602150537634
7986400,5,B00008QSAE,"There are many who identify Klemperer's Philharmonia recording as the standard by which to judge performances of the Brahms German Requiem. Certainly it is a wonderful performance. I love it too. And there are other excellent ones I own and love. Maybe 10 others. At least.

Now imagine this. In 2007 EMI releases an April 8, 1964, DVD of Karl Richter conducting the best orchestra and choir in France, the National French Radio Orchestra, yes the same one with which Beecham and Klemperer and others have recorded legendary blockbuster performances (e. g. Beecham's version of Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique and Klemperer rendition of Brahms Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh - both available through Amazon). Here Richter is doing Brahm's German Requiem (auf Deutsch! no less!)in Paris of that year with THAT orchestra and choir. That by itself 20 years after the war with a German conductor who could be only in his mid-30's at that time. Now, why would EMI release it 44 years later?

Now there may be historical reasons of which I am not aware. For instance it is 20 years after the Normandy invasion and since the Nazis left Paris! Anybody listening? However, if one simply experiences this performance, then it becomes quite clear why it is released. It deserves to be. It is a monumental performance of a great work! As some Americans might say, ""by the French, no less!"" But friend, je parle francais, and this is a great performance of this great Protestant Requiem by any orchestra! By the French, no less. But why should that surprise anybody interested enough to read this review?

Passion, precision, and conviction mark this performance. Richter can embody great emotion and, besides that, is a great conductor by anybody's standards. The orchestra is superlatively directed and plays gorgeously. The choir gives us controlled but inspired singing. Stewart, the baritone, is sensational. Lear, the soprano, sings in a registry I have seldom heard. In my opinion, Richter already has the best Messiah ever recorded (with the LPO in 1973) and the best Bach (and Handel) cantatas/ oratorios, etc., anywhere. He is not this pedantic lost period-piece professor of music who happens to conduct the Munich Bach Orchestra and Choir. He is a major music figure. Germans of that era knew it and were saddened by his death by stroke on February 15, 1981. We were deprived of a great musician in his best and most mature years. Viewing this DVD helps us realize during his age 37 (or so) what we are missing in his 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's. Just think. Without a disc like this, we would not even be aware of his opera performances and symphonies and oratorios by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Bruckner, Dvorak, Verdi, and Reger, to mention a few. In the prime of his life this great talent was lost to us. I am so fond of his music that I miss him still. And I would advise anyone to get his 10 disc offering ""Sacred Masterpieces"" on DG Archiv through Amazon.com that includes the Matthew and John Passions, the B minor Mass, the Magnificat, and the Christmas Oratorio with soloists like Ernst Haefliger, Fritz Wunderlich, Dietrich Fisher-Dieskau, Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, and a bunch of other greats.

Maybe nobody has more correspondence with this German Requiem than Richter because his special childhood and training in the Lutheran church (his father, a pastor), Brahm's own church culture I believe (protestantism), with Brahm's use of the historic text of the Martin Luther Bible, and the biblical texts that Bach and Handel use for much of their music. Richter understands the bottomline these composers are trying to communicate. And he was a pretty good shake at directing choirs, orchestras, singing, and playing harpsichord and organ (with many recordings on that alone.) This Requiem performance shows it. Richter communicates in a special way with the meaning of the texts, the inner and outer beauty of the music, and the corresonding dynamics of the orchestra and choirs. He has bundeled it all together in an historic two decade peace celebration and French performance of this great work.

Get it. If you love the Brahms German Requiem as I do, you need to see it. Richter and the National French Radio Orchestra and choir know where they want to go with this music. All three excel: conductor, orchestra, and choir.
Expresivo!

You will not forget this performance if you love the Brahm's German Requiem. This feels to me like the Brahms German Requiem version of the Furtwanger Bayreuth Beethoven 9th. Klemperer is not the only one who can turn in a great performance. (By the way, I love also the Giulini, Kubelik, Abbado, and Toscanini performances, among others!) This one is historically fitting and exceedingly well done. Order it as soon as you can through Amazon. Order it any way you can. You will not regret this purchase!",1236816000,18,4888,4.954878048780488
7986401,5,B00008QSAE,"When Philipp Spitta - the Bach biographer and great musicologist of the 19th century, became familiar with the Requiem, he wrote a deeply felt letter claiming that he was """"one of many who had become a better person through having made the acquaintance of that music""""

 Max Bruch was another, he took the trouble of going to Bremen for the first performance, and dedicated his first symphony to Brahms as a sign of his great admiration.

The splendid music of Brahms's Requiem is also inspired in response to Bismarck's success in defeating France (1870) and creating a unified Germany (Likewise the `'Triumphlied'', Op. 55, a work in four movements for eight-part choruses and orchestra. This is, now possibly his least known work. It was quickly incorporated into the repertory at the time, and began its life alongside the Requiem in yet another Good Friday performance in Bremen Cathedral).

In his letter to his close friend Joachim, Brahms said: """"I have written (Rhapsody) acclaiming Bismarck; so that in any case steer me to Germany, and then I'll hear music where you are, as well"""" A nationalist north German living in Austria, Brahms was obviously attentive to the ongoing struggle for dominance between Prussia and the Habsburg Monarchy. ... {{The Bohemian-Austrian Ministers in Vienna would not yet have forgotten the events of 1866 when Bismarck's Prussian army invaded Bohemia and defeated the Austrian army.}}

Brahms was proud to discover his Requiem was also to honor the war dead.

The melody, along with several variations, is also the second movement of one of Haydn's most famous ""String Quartet, nicknamed the ""Emperor Quartet"". The melody was later used in ""Das Lied der Deutschen"""" which is still Germany's National Anthem. Brahms reference to 1866 concerns Austria's decisive defeat by Prussia at the battle of Sadowa (Konigsgratz) in Bohemia, underscoring the first time that Habsburg military might was overcome by another German-speaking nation: a requiem for the centuries of Habsburg supremacy?

Brahms worked on German Requiem (First major performance of Requiem in 1868 -  he was then only 35). His mother's death (Feb 2, 1865) urged him on to a work he may well have been thinking about since Schumann's death. Albert Dietrich remembered seeing the march which constitutes the second movement when it was the slow scherzo of the two-piano sonata-turned-symphony-turned-piano concerto, ten years earlier - a connection to the turmoil and anguish surrounding Robert Schumann's illness and death.

Florence May, whose biography has the advantage of having been conceived and written while many of the main players were still alive, is quite explicit. She wrote: ""We all think he wrote it (the requiem) in her (his mother's) memory, though he has never expressly said so"". Clara Schumann told the author some years later"""".

 Karajan's interpretation is splendid, excellent, and is of the highest quality. Karajan gave us this DVD one year before he died. But, will persons with such exceptional intellectual abilities and originality ever die??",1223510400,,3076,5.2317073170731705
7986402,5,B00008QSAE,"Critics of von Karajan's conducting during his final few years make an unfortunate mistake. He actually demonstrates a maturity that enhances every aspect of this Brahms Requiem, including his selection of soloists, tempos (yeah, I know, tempi), internal choral voicing, and blending of orchestra and voices. His minimalist direction is most welcome.  The fugatto that ends Denn wir haben hie keine bleibende Statt is one of the most impressive interplays of a chorus and ascending lower strings that I have ever heard. Von Karajan knows exactly what to do with this score, orchestra and chorus for the benefit of us all.",1143849600,6,621,5.148514851485149
7986403,2,B00008QSAE,"You probably can't get a more perfect version of this requiem, but unfortunately the sound is about 2 seconds ahead of the vision, so the whole DVD is out of sync, which is most annoying when viewing it. I got a headache as a result. Best just to turn off the picture and just listen to it. But the makers of the DVD should have realized this before releasing it!",1130371200,8,363,4.2
7986404,4,B00008QSAE,"Anyone who is familiar with Karajan's long history with this highly approachable work by Brahms and who appreciates the lifelong study the conductor brought to this masterpiece need not hesitate in acquiring this DVD. This is perhaps not his greatest single reading of the German Requiem, but as a final statement from one facing the inevitability of death, it is a deeply moving document. And, as usual, the performers give their fullest under Karajan's masterful leadership.

Van Dam brings his immaculate technique and thoughtful approach to the text, while Battle shines in her own solo. Both worked closely with Karajan on several projects, and they truly are in sync in their performances here. The orchestra adds the immediately recognizable warmth of the Vienna Philharmonic.

Two complaints: Sony botched the original DVD master and forgot to include subtitles. I notified them of this, and they said it would not be fixed. So despite what the cover may still say, there are NO subtitles, greatly reducing this DVD's user friendliness. (I was tempted to say ""usefulness,"" as an educator.)

Second, the first trumpet simply was not there in the second movement immediately after the words ""Aber des Herrn Wort bleibet in Ewigkeit,"" right before the fugue on ""Die Erloeseten des Herrn werden wieder kommen ..."" This error in the original sound recording (as issued on CD by DG) was not addressed in the DVD soundtrack either. It is surprising and unfortunate that no one, including Karajan, caught this mistake. As his own video company (Telemondial) made the recording and as he personally supervised the audio and video master, it was ultimately his fault that this important climax was thus undermined.

Were it possible to give 4.5 stars, I would have. But with Sony's mistake and the minor gaffe in the performance, it would be unfair to suggest this production is perfect. Still, it is indeed magical.",1117584000,19,1914,5.085987261146497
