7932561,4,B000056PL1,"It's nothing easy to watch a Chabrol's film; the discursive speech passes through several sieves, product of a visible literary influence and a theatrical narrative. Based on the dramatic facts derived from an obscure death and rape about a little girl, a teacher is unfairly condemned, before the truth blossoms. You know how the behavior of the opinion matrix, where the emotions and the primary instincts always overshadow beforehand any possibility of reply.

Our personage is a very introspective man, who before the facts decides to isolate still more; on the other hand, being incapable to satisfy his woman and establish the necessary communication before such dramatic circumstances, he gradually encloses.

The secondary plot gradually increases, when a very distinguished journalist and occasional writer is a handsome guy who pretends and eventually will seduce the woman of our troubled teacher in disgrace to complicate still more this low paced but even zealously well made script.

I would like you to recommend five emblematic pieces of this pyramidal director; The Boucher, This man must die and Innocent with dirty hands, The ceremony and Merci for the chocolate ; because of the fact the particular creative universe of this director has maintained a conceptual compass around these themes that definitively have become the raw material of almost the ninety five per cent of his films.

Highly recommended.",1153353600,,1426,5.3244444444444445
