8361594,1,B000TF9NKY,"Well, they at least got one thing right on this film - the title. This is one movie that in my opinion has no redeeming value. Bad acting. Bad directing. Bad storyline. Bad cinematograpy. Just bad, bad and more bad.",1409270400,3,215,4.4
8361595,3,B000TF9NKY,Not all that great.,1406764800,,19,4.0
8361596,1,B000TF9NKY,"I made it to minute 27, and can not believe i wasted that much time watching this crap.  Not a damn thing interesting happened at all in that first half hour.  I bet the best part of the movie are the credits.",1406246400,3,209,3.9523809523809526
8361597,2,B000TF9NKY,"not a very interesting movie. it drags on after the first few minutes.
I know its an old UK film but it could have been more interesting.

I would stay away from this film",1406160000,,171,4.029411764705882
8361598,1,B000TF9NKY,"This version of RTN was made in 2009 and WAS NOT MADE BY MONTE HELLMAN!!! and it stars (if you can call this acting) Cheyenne Crowe and was directed by Juliette Munet. A FILM THAT GOES NOWHERE
Its about robbery, murder, sex, drugs and sleep depravation. I was able to sum up the movie in one sentence and not waste 98 minutes to do it!
This is one of those movies that can be placed in the ever growing ""WORST MOVIE EVER MADE"" category listing. I can honestly say that there is nothing of value to come from watching this movie because every element of the production is terribly done from the writing to the acting to the direction to the writing is and was not worth the time, money, effort (if there was any),toeither make or watch this ^@$*!^$.
There is a fair amount of cursing including the Fword and there are a few sex scenes (Nothing exposed) except from a semi sheer bra. The movie has a few scenes of tame violence with some blood.
PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES THE 98 MINUTES ANDRUN AWAY FROM THE 2009 VERSION OF RTN!!!!",1405814400,4,1025,4.371727748691099
8361599,1,B000TF9NKY,"This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Long shots of people walking around, laying in bed or just staring into space while a boring soundtrack droned on in the background. The music ranged from opera to outback to jungle to whatever else they had to throw in to take your mind off the fact that the writer must have quit at the start of the movie. The little dialogue was mostly of the charactors being rude to each other for no reason. This was horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your time and money. Don't buy this!",1359590400,4,554,4.235849056603773
8361600,4,B000TF9NKY,"This was a quirky and off-beat film. Although it seemed a bit fractured at times, it was reminiscent of early David Lynch before he became famous. I loved the music.",1355270400,2,165,4.533333333333333
