8149625,5,B000JBXHRS,Great place to start if you're interested in learning travis style guitar. Buster breaks down the songs really well to make sure you get every note. May be a little bland for someone with a few fingerpicking songs already under their belt.,1507852800,,239,4.714285714285714

8149627,4,B000JBXHRS,"This is a very good lesson by an excellent guitar player.
Buster B. Jones was one of the best, GOD rest his soul.",1378425600,3,113,3.9565217391304346
8149628,5,B000JBXHRS,"When I stared playing guitar you would be a lucky person to have a Beatles song book with guitar chords.
There was very little learning information out there then.
Today there is so much it's hard to determine where to start.
When I was watching the first part of the DVD it appeared to be so basic (hears a C, F, G cord) I about turned it off.
What I realized was this guy was teaching the backbone of finger picking style. This is something that is hard to find.
In this lesson he shares that secret of how to become better than good. It can be learned from beginning to advanced players.
One thing that may cloud the lesson is that he plays a nylon string guitar using all his fingers.
I prefer thumb and index finger and playing the pinched melody notes as a strum or as one string.
This works great if you play that way.
This guy was the boss.
Thanks Buster for sharing your great lessons.",1368144000,,894,4.233918128654971
8149629,5,B000JBXHRS,"Buster B. Jones was a rare bird. He was a fantastic guitar player AND, more importantly to this review, a great teacher.  He puts a lie to the ""those who can do, those who can't teach"" wisdom.  I've been setting under some form of six string for longer that I care to admit to and know whereof I speak.
If you want to play guitar this DVD is an excellent place to start.  When you get this down he has advanced classes on DVD.
For your viewing/listening enjoyment he also cut CD's and performance DVD's and Amazon had them the last time I looked.",1297296000,,546,4.230769230769231
8149630,5,B000JBXHRS,This DVD does exactly as advertised and more. Buster is not only a great guitarist but also a great teacher! I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn how to play with a thumbpick.,1268524800,6,188,4.4
