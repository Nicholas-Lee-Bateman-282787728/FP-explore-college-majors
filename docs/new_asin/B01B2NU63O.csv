8749126,4,B01B2NU63O,"These are decent dvds...I bought it for the bagua dvd,the little san shou dvd has a good presentation of a little known aspect of tai chi,sort of a ""hard style"" of martial circular movements with a lot of reeling silk. Not begining level.
The chinese boxing dvd is a lot of footage of classroom and some competition examples of this wrestling style. A small bit of examples of conditioning/drills,but no instruction other than by example. Not recommended for beginning learning.
The bagua dvd has some things i I have not seen on other bagua dvds,and the presenter has good silk reeling and moves well. Shows numerous exercizes for developing bagua style movement,but no explanation at all.....I would not recommend this for a bagauzhang beginner's one and only dvd,but great for seeing a rather unique style of movement and some of the practices to develop it. One of the things he does is the hand/arm/body movements of the first (and second?)changing palm done ""in place"" ,without the legwork,I thought that was a great way to practice/actually see what is going on with the arms/torso before connecting it all up. Only covers up to 1st and 2nd changing palm in this dvd. I am going to get his other dvds that are available.
I had to get an all region dvd player to view this,even though the description says ntsc, and there was a ""ntsc""sticker on the package,these would not play on my regular uss player-bought a phillips dvp5990 used and it plays fine on it.
These have an optional english language commentary done by a non-native speaker reading it,but no subtitles.",1515196800,,1573,4.82962962962963
