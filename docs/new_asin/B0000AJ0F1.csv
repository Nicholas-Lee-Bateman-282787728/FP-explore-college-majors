7997388,5,B0000AJ0F1,"I purchased this video a few years back. It's a little more advanced. But taking your time and practice, you will learn from this video. Paul has 10 mini solos, showing the licks in context which is very helpful. Very good and useful licks. Good quality video worth the money.",1325635200,,276,4.54
7997389,5,B0000AJ0F1,"I've bought a shelf full of books and videos over the years that are frankly worthless or close to worthless.  This is a good video to learn both the basic ""vocabulary"" of country guitar as well as some advanced playing.  Paul Kramer teaches and shows what he doing and keeps it at a good pace- by that I mean explains it without belaboring the simple points.  Unfortunately most videos seem to either have someone ripping through a bunch of licks and not really teaching, or else spending too much time on fairly basic stuff you already know if you've been playing a while. I've been playing the country style for quite a few years now and I learned a lot from this video and it advanced my playing.  For intermediate to advanced players, not beginners.  Of all the country videos I've bought I would say this one is among the most worthwhile.  Heath Wright also put out a couple good videos that you might still be able to find.",1248998400,,930,4.4733727810650885
7997390,2,B0000AJ0F1,Boring...I learned nothing. Just hack session licks. No spirit. No soul.  It'd be great for a guy in a cover band that knows nothing about country and needed to learn something quick.,1204156800,,183,4.71875
