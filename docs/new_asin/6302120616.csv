433298,5,6302120616,"From the standpoint of history, artistic license abounds in this classic adventure movie.  In fairness, the filmmaker posts a disclaimer of the historical veracity of the film right at the beginning.  Errol Flynn is at his flamboyant best as dashing English officer, Geofrrey Vickers.  He vies with his brother (Patrick Knowles) for the love of Olivia DeHavilland.  Romantic sublplots aside, Flynn and an army of supporting actors hold the thin red line of 19th century British imperialism.  C. Henry Gordon is evilly conniving as Surat Khan, leader of the fictional Suristan faction.  When England cuts off his money, Surat Khan wages war against the British interlopers.  After Surat Khan massacres non-combatants at the garrison of Chokoti (sp.?), India is too hot to hold him.  In typical Hollywood fashion, the action shifts to the Crimea at Sebastopol where the British face the Russians at Balaklava Heights.  As an inside joke, the Russian commander bears an uncanny resemblance to Joseph Stalin.  Who should be collaborating with the Russians but Surat Khan?  Vickers, still burning with anger over the massacre of innocents, discovers this and he forges orders for the Light Brigade to attack.  Under the direction of Michael Curtiz, the slam-bang action sequences of this movie provide memorable thrills.  The fighting at Chokoti is both exciting and unsettling as women and children fall before rebel bullets.  The staging of the charge is impressive, if controversial.  Many of the horses were destroyed because of injuries from the deliberate tripping.  As the lancers charge into the face of roaring canon, to the right of them, to the left of them, in front of them, quotes from Tennyson's poem appear on screen.  The shot of the fallen lancer still holding aloft the billowing Union Jack in his lifeless hand is great imagery.  ""When can their glory fade?""  Filmed in glorious B&W, this classic action/adventure film is a good example of the quality product of the Warner Brothers film sutdio at its Depression Era height.  Enjoy the old fashioned fun. ;-)",1014768000,79,2073,5.13134328358209
433299,5,6302120616,"I very highly recommend this film.  It is very good, and I would give it more stars if I could.  Errol Flynn is wonderful in it and very heroic as well.  It deserves all the stars that it can get.",1008374400,,196,3.85
433300,4,6302120616,"That's what Errol Flynn barks at his brother Patric Knowles when that gentleman tells Flynn that his fiancee Olivia de Havilland is now in love with Knowles. As if that were Flynn's only problem,though, in this Crimean War setting. Of course, accuracy-wise there's a bit off: the Crimea really isn't all that close to India, so all sorts of different exotic locations and costumes are mixed up together, but if you don't mind that, well, you'll enjoy ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" just fine.
""CoftheLB"" boasts an excellent cast supporting Flynn: in addition to the aforementioned Olivia and Patric, there's David Niven, Donald Crisp, and Nigel Bruce, just to name a few stalwarts. Plenty of action, with masscres and horse charges galore, not to mention a rousing score by Max Steiner, and of course, Tennyson's poem gets interspersed with the final dynamic charge.
Noble Six Hundred, indeed--watch it and cheer!",1002067200,4,916,5.072847682119205
433301,5,6302120616,"Most people wrote that the movie is a history disaster, thats true, but, I mean if you want history get a documentory, this is an artistic movie and all of those movies have at least something missing. It is one of the greatest action and war movies I ever saw, I watched it enough times to basically memorize it. Flynn is great and his ansemble of actors are perfect. The romance in this movie is partly relevant. What matters is how Flynn and Havilland are great friends even though she doesn't love him but the fact is that the charge and the attack on the british fort were war movie marvels. The surat khan (fiction) is shown the villian as he is and the sad ending of Flynns demise is a glorious end to the already beautiful movie. I RRRRRRRecomend it to all lovers of Flynn and action war movies in general!!!!!!!!",997833600,3,821,4.407894736842105
433302,4,6302120616,"As long as you do not expact historic correctness, this is quite an enjoyable movie. Flynn for once in a not so very sympathetic role does some of his best work ever in Charge of the Light Brigade. As a British officer,  already soured by personal tragedy who orders his troops to make a  spectacular, but suicidal charge against the Russian guns he is more of a  living figure then in his usual roles. On the one hand you deplore his  fanatism, that leads to the ruinous assault and his personal character is  not very likable, on the other hand, one can always understand his feelings  and when, during the final attack he desperately tries to get himself  killed because he knows, that there is no way back for him after disobeying  direct orders. His character rises to a level that is overwelming in its  tragedy. The story has nothing whatsoever to do with the historical  reality, but it does not need to. Instead, by giving the British a reason  for their insane attack (A personal vengeance for the massacre of countless  wemon and children by one of the enemy commanders) the creators have  transformed a tale of foolish misunderstandings and tragic stupidity in a  story that highlights the sadness and uselesness of war in a far more  effective way. For Flynn in the end kills the man whose life he once saved,  dying himself in the attempt displaying for all the world the complete  futility of this sort of grandstanding, swordslinging heroism.",950659200,14,1458,4.699604743083004
433303,4,6302120616,"Following the success of Errol Flynn and Olivia deHavilland in Captain Blood, Warner Brothers quickly put them back together into another action film.  But it's a surprising pairing, since deHavilland's character isn't  in love with Flynn, but his brother instead.  Actually, the deHavilland  character and the love plot really arent' necessary, although they don't  take away from the film.  The movie is an action filled account of an ill  fated charge by the British against a much larger Russian army in India.  Tennyson wrote a famous poem about the incident, praising the British for  their bravery.  The movie explains the events leading up to the charge, and  as someone who is not a history expert, I'll accept the views of others  that say that the film is much more fiction than fact.  To me, that doesn't  matter, because it entertains nonetheless.  The musical score is terrific  (as any score by Max Steiner usually is), and Michael Curtiz's direction is  excellent, particularly in his depiction of the sweeping action.  One thing  is surprising.  Nowadays, as people have become more aware of protecting  animals in film and television, the climatic scene in this film is sort of  disturbing, given that you can see a number of horses being injured, if not  killed.  But overlooking that, Charge of the Light Brigade is an action  filled epic that is most impressive.",949104000,9,1383,4.986784140969163
433304,4,6302120616,"The Hollywood version of the Charge of the Light Brigade is one of the most rousing action pictures ever produced.  As Errol Flynn vehicles go, it stands perfectly alongside They Died With Their Boots On as superior  filmmaking based only loosely on history.
With that said, forget the  history lesson and enjoy the movie.  Flynn is predictably heroic as  Captain, then Major, Jeffrey Vickers of the 27th Lancers.  He begins the  film in the far reaches of India, first sharing hunting excursions with and  later hunting the duplicitous Surat Khan (very villainous and very  ficticious).
His romantic interest is the ever beautiful Olivia  DeHaviland who, strangely enough, actually falls for Flynn's younger  brother, Percy.  Ever gallant, Major Vickers ensures that his brother is  out of harm's way and safe to return to the woman both love but he cannot  have.
Of course, the climax of the film is the charge itself, brilliantly  staged with mounting speed, tension and ferocity as the words of Lord  Tennyson's immortal poem are superimposed over it.  This is one of the most  famous and breathtaking action sequences in the history of cinematography,  and is well worth waiting through the movie for, although by far not the  only piece of derring-do in the film.
If The Charge of the Light Brigade  had not remained well known for its charm as a movie, it would have been  remembered for a far different reason.  The incredible realism of the  climactic cavalry charge was achieved at a heavy cost.  So many horses were  seriously injured or killed in the making of this picture that humane  organizations worldwide demanded that such excesses never again be  undertaken.  The next time you see the disclaimer ""No animals were  harmed in the making of the film,"" you now know why.
All that aside,  The Charge of the Light Brigade is a wonderfully entertaining production.  Like all the best films of its time, it mixes action, romance, adventure  and a healthy serving of humor to provide a tremendously satisfying  experience.
If you want to know the history, read the book.  If you want  to have some fun, watch the movie.",945648000,49,2131,4.887640449438202
433305,5,6302120616,"""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" which was released in 1936, was Errol Flynn's second starring role. Already an international sensation thanks to ""Captain Blood,"" Flynn shot to even higher levels of stardom with the release of this action-packed desert drama that co-starred Olivia DeHavilland.
Although the script is largely fictional -- Warner Brothers rarely let history stand in the way of a good story -- the film is exciting, beautifully photographed and well mounted. The final charge, in which Flynn leads the Light Brigade into the ""Valley of Death,"" is spine-tingling even to this day. Flynn is unbelievably handsome and dashing, DeHavilland is top notch as his love interest, and the entire cast makes ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" a joy to watch.
As an interesting note, co-star David Niven wrote in his autobiography ""The Moon's a Balloon"" of a fistfight between Flynn and a huge, brawny extra on the set of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade."" Flynn -- whom the extras thought was a spoiled pretty boy -- so severely thrashed the big extra that an ambulance came to take him to the hospital. After that, said Niven, Flynn was regarded with a newfound and healthy respect.  END",892684800,,1194,4.910891089108911

433318,5,6302120616,"This is a superb movie that is a visual historical novel directed by Michael Curtiz.  There was a poem by Tenneyson that gave adulation to
The Charge of the Light Brigade - 600 British Lancers who challenged the Russian Army of 25,000 and prevailed in the battle - but at great cost and casualties.  There was a massacre at a British fortress in Northern India that prompted revenge.  This historic engagement occurred in 1865 during the Crimean War -  at the same time of our own American Civil War that was in progress.  There is a great deal of ""Hollywood"" drama in this production, but a memorable one with a combination of heroics and legend.  This films reveals the national struggles towards the end of the 19th Century in that part of the world where there was still the nation of Persia and incidents at the Kyber Pass, as well as the struggle of the Czar of Russia to hold the Crimea for a seaport.

433339,5,6302120616,"It's all about revenge, much deserved revenge. It is a film in glorious black and white that details the famous Charge of the Light Brigade just as it did not happen-well the charge happened but much of the story is just a story. We need stories like this. It is about good destroying evil. The bad guys are bad and deserve what they get. Yes evil is black and good is white. It is clear that this film is from a time when heroes were not darker than their nemesis.

The cast has some of the best stars ever to appear on camera. The acting is good acting and the Charge is executed by a direct who was a former cavalry officer if I am not mistaken. It is a master piece in acting and directing.

This is one of Flynn's eight classic films and has nothing that would cause viewers to shade the eyes of anyone in the family. It does require us to ask what has happened to Hollywood. This is the way movies should be made again. Not remakes but new stories where white males and females have problems and conflicts without requiring them to disrobe or to perform senseless violence. Yes there is violence here but is it really senseless? Not at all.

This film should be viewed by families. Film makers who have  lost any sense of movie making should be challenged to create new films, about historical events that have good defeat evil and inspire the viewers to do great things. I am not holding  my breath for anything like that to ever come about. Fortunately I have Charge of the Light Brigade to enjoy for years to come.",1463184000,3,1523,4.329824561403509

433343,3,6302120616,"As many reviewers have indicated, you do not look to Michael Curtiz's retelling of nineteenth century history for accuracy. Rather you approach it as a western transposed to the days of Empire, with the British colonizers standing in for the cowboys and the Russians or the tribes-people led by Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon) as the Indians.

Some of the battle sequences are breath-takingly shot, with director Curtiz's camera tracking over vast swaths of the Californian landscape as he follows the opposing forces into battle. The eponymous Charge is particularly memorable, with row upon row of horses stretching as far as the eye can see, moving inexorably from right to left of the frame. The screen dissolves into extracts from Tennyson's poem of the same name, emphasizing the doomed nature of the operation, yet asking us to remember how it contributed to a British victory in the end.

In truth the film does not have much of a plot, save for highlighting the rivalry between brothers Geoffrey and Perry Vickers (Errol Flynn, Patric Knowles) for the hand of Elsa (Olivia de Havilland). But then we do not expect a Flynn swashbuckler to have too many nuances; rather we are given the chance to marvel at his equestrian skills and his ability to command the shot through sheer magnetism. In THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE he does not disappoint - despite his much-publicized differences with director Curtiz, he sails through the film with a kind of nonchalance (nowadays we might call it ""style"") that justifies his status as one of Warner Brothers's most bankable stars.

The film offers a treat for fans of Hollywood England, with the supporting cast boasting a youthful David Niven (who by then had set up home with Flynn) plus a gallery of familiar faces including E. E. Clive, Henry Stephenson, Nigel Bruce and Donald Crisp. By the mid- Thirties they were all in the evening of their illustrious careers, but found a lucrative living playing various grandees. While the roles did not place too much demands on their acting-talents (they basically played the same part), they give THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE a patina of respectability - precisely the kind of thing the studio bosses wanted by engaging them in the first place.

In truth the battle-sequences go on a little too long, and Max Steiner's score tends to be over-intrusive, making viewers yearn for quieter moments where the actors can be given the chance to talk to one another. Nonetheless THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE is a prime example of a kind of movie that enjoyed a peak of popularity during the Thirties.",1451174400,,2594,4.875283446712018
433344,3,6302120616,"I am not really sure what to make of this movie. There is a lot good about it and we must remember this was very early in motion picture times. I have learned to expect that much of any supposedly historical drama will be some fabricated romance. And I have come to expect loose history but this one really pushes the envelope. Yes it is early Hollywood, but it is still SO Hollywood as to be almost a self-parody in a more modern age. And what makes me say this is that if you didn't know what really happened in history, you would think the British won the battle because in true Hollywood order the hero kills the villain and it all pretty much ends there. To manage to gloss over one of the worst strategic failures in history takes some doing.

Welcome to Hollywood of the depression era. Where American and European good guys had not a hair out of place, where foreign good guys were noble but still peons, and where foreign villains haven't bathed in a year.

433456,5,6302120616,"Errol Flynn epitomizes the kind of hero that transcends time.  He is at his best in action films and Charge of the Light Brigade combines the strength of his acting character with the backdrop of the colonial British Empire.  The speech he gives to the 27th Light Brigade just before they engage the Russians (and Surat Kahn) is both inspiring and highly emotional.  Against the famous poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, this epic battle where the 27th charges into infamy is (in my opinion) is one of the most famous and emotionally thrilling in movie history.  You feel part of the 27th as they ride into destiny.  It is very interesting to note how little has changed from the Crimea of the 1800's to what has/is unfolding in the Crimea and Ukraine today.  British (the West) versus Russians for control of that key piece of land.  Acting and character development of the 1930's and 40's is quite different from what you see today.  Errol Flynn could be a hero with any generation.  Enjoy this movie for what it is and accept the fact that special effects today would have effectively addressed treatment of horses in the battle scenes.  This is a classic movie - FACT.",1397260800,,1167,4.648780487804878

433488,5,6302120616,"The Charge of the Light Brigade was released by Warner Bros. in 1936 (during the Great Depression) and was directed by the superb Michael Curtiz.  It stars the young Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, with an equally young David Niven.  This is the second of nine movies made by Warner Brothers' with the romantic couple, Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn.  When the look into each other's eyes, their on-screen chemistry is unmistakable (despite the love triangle story line).

Although the movie is supposed to be about the Crimean War (1853 ~ 1856), the plot is almost a total work of fiction. It is based on Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem about the Light Brigade's glorious charge at Balaklava.  The poem was published in October 1854:

""Half a league, half a league,
Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death,
Rode the six hundred...

...Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred...

...When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd.
Honour the charge they made!
Honour the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred!""

However, even though this movie takes total poetic license (fiction), it is still a great story with the dashing Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.

The plot surrounds Geoffrey Vickers (Errol Flynn) who is a Major in the British 27th Lancers (although he starts out  as Captain at the beginning of the movie). Surat Kahn's (C. Henry Gordon) soldiers attack the lightly guarded garrison at Chukoti.  The deceitful Surat Kahn offers safe passage for the surviving soldiers, women and children if they agree to turn the garrison over to Surat Kahn.  He then proceeds to massacre the defenseless British women and children as they leave the fort.  Of course, Geoffrey Vickers vows to avenge the fallen.

As a sub-plot, Geoffrey Vickers has fallen for the beautiful Elsa Campbell (Olivia d Havillad) but unknown to Vickers, Elsa has fallen in love with his brother Captain Perry Vickers (Patrick Knowles) and he with her.

Major Vickers and the men of the 27th Lancers get their chance at revenge on the Crimean Peninsula when England goes to war with Russia. Surat Khan has sought protection of his Russian allies. Vickers leads the men in the famous charge into the valley of death.

Muchael Curtiz's directing style is unmistakable.  The use of shadow in the opening scenes, where you see the Court dancers, is reminiscent of the use of shadows in the famous sword duel in Robin Hood.  During the hunting scene, the camera shots of the elephants and the leopards are terrific.  However, if you are an animal lover (I own 3 cats, who are truly loved as a part of the family), the scene is hard to watch.

Curtiz was born in Hungary and immigrated to the U.S.  He was known for his ""creative"" use of the English language.  During filming, Curtiz exclaimed ""Bring on the empty horses!"", meaning ""riderless horses"". David Niven would later use this phrase as the title of his autobiography.

There are a couple of goofs in the movie.  The British Flag is being carried upside down by the Lancers as they are about to go into ""the valley of death"".  In all the subsequent shots the flag is the correct way up.  During the charge scene, Surat Khan first holds the telescope to his right eye, and a few moments later uses his left eye.  The trip wires that kill the horses are totally visible during the charge. This occurs multiple times during the action sequence.  The film states that it is dedicated ""to the officers and men of the Light Brigade who died victorious in a gallant charge at Balaklava for Queen and Country - A.D. 1856."" However, the battle at Balaklava and the Charge of the Light Brigade occurred in October 1854.  Humorously, after the massacre, Flynn sympathetically listens to Major Singh crying over the body of his murdered son (Prema) who is clearly wiggling his toes in the foreground of the scene.

The DVD is so superbly sharp and crisp that it could be mitaken for a a Blu-ray.  The pearls on Surat Kahn's head and neck shimmer in the light during the close-up shots.  You feel like you can reach out and touch the pearls.  The white marble walls and the reflective marble floors in the palace are incredible.  look at the reflection of te British Officers as they walk in.  The British dress uniforms are fantastic.  It is a terrific transfer to DVD.

433513,5,6302120616,"Classic duo of Errol Flynn & his lovely leading lady for 8 films, Olivia de Havilland; this is a Hollywood treatment of Britain's colonial aspirations in the 19th century.  Based on the stirring poem: ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" stirring it most certainly is - if you can forget that the so-called 'bad guys' had a perfect right to chase the invaders from their midst.
 The picture contains a sterling cast of Warner Brothers' actors: with an inspired pairing of Spring Byington & Nigel Bruce, the consistently wonderful, Donald Crisp, & then newcomer David Niven.
A love triangle sub-plot, between Flynn's brother & de Havilland -again if you can believe any girl would take Patric Knowles, handsome but insipid, over our man Flynn in those wonderfully tight-panted uniforms.  A good story and very well told by director Michael Curtiz; but hard for me to forgive those trip wires he used on the horses in the charge scenes.
But boys & girls- these were real actors, real people & real horses in those scenes; and I think, engenders a bit more authenticity than what passes for realism now.

433527,5,6302120616,"I think if I had to choose a favorite Errol Flynn film, The Charge Of The Light Brigade might well be it. Flynn's great swashbucklers, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk and The Adventures Of Robin Hood are all marvelous entertainments to be sure, yet The Charge Of The Light Brigade is darker in tone and more complex than these others, providing more of an emotional impact. As other reviewers have stated, the movie is not factual. But this is not a fault. On the contrary, the storyline by Michel Jacobs is one of its strengths. And though the film is not faithful to the actual historical events, it winds up being true to the spirit of Tennyson's poem.  The movie clearly states in the beginning that what we are about to see is fictional. So, it should be judged as a work of fiction and on its own merits. Those history buffs looking for historical accuracy might rather slog through the 1968 Tony Richardson version, but I'll stick with this one which Michael Curtiz made for Warner Brothers in 1936.

Each time I watch this film I see new things in it. In my last viewing it struck me how this film may be regarded as the story of a man who brought about a great tragedy by doing what seems to be the right thing: he saved another man's life. During a leopard hunt hosted by the Indian chieftain, Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon), Flynn's character, Major Geoffrey Vickers, manages to shoot a leopard as it is about to pounce on Surat Khan, thus saving his life. Had Vickers not been so good a shot and the cat had killed its prey, the horrible massacre which Khan later perpetrates would not have happened, nor, for that matter, would occur the fateful suicidal charge into  the valley of Balaclava in the Crimea.

Vickers is a brave and resourceful soldier who is also politically savvy.  His assessment of each predicament that the British encounter  is shown to be sound, whereas that of his superiors are usually faulty. He knows his opponent,  Surat Khan, cannot be trusted. Yet as a soldier he must follow orders, and the British pay a heavy price for their leaders' misreading of their enemy. In a horrifying turn of events Surat Khan ends up mercilessly slaughtering an entire garrison, including women and children. A crime which is never forgotten by Vickers and the men in his regiment.

For all his prowess in military and political affairs, Vickers  misreads affairs of the heart. His fiance, Elsa (Olivia de Havilland), has fallen in love with his brother. At first, he believes it is only a one-sided infatuation on the part of his brother, Perry (Patric Knowles), but as the film continues, Elsa finally confesses her love for Perry.  All these events, compounded with the knowledge that Surat Khan, who has escaped India, is now with his Russian allies in the Crimea, leads Vickers' to finally disobey orders, and lead the Light Brigade on their climactic charge of retribution.

And what a charge it is. One of the greatest action sequences committed to celluloid. Beautifully shot and edited, with a marvelous score by Max Steiner, it is a rousing and satisfying climax to an already engrossing story. Errol Flynn is at his best in this movie, bringing to it all his dashing heroics, charm, and athleticism that you would expect. But as  Geoffrey Vickers, who has lost the woman he loves, who is haunted by  a war atrocity which could've been avoided, and who yearns for vengeance, Flynn proves just how capable an actor he truly was. He is flanked by a splendid supporting cast; in addition to those already mentioned: Donald Crisp, Henry Stephenson, Nigel Bruce, Spring Byington, and David Niven. The high quality of the acting and direction, the compelling story, lavish production values, action scenes, and musical score all make this a magnificent cinematic achievement from Hollywood's golden age.",1308787200,,3823,4.756797583081571

433530,3,6302120616,"How can you go wrong with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland in a Michael Curtiz film? Throw in such notable character actors as Henry Stephenson, Nigel Bruce, J. Carrol Nash, Donald Crisp, and Spring Byington and you're guaranteed success. And yet, the film is the weakest of the Flynn/Curtiz/De Havilland collaborations.

Curtiz, de Havilland and Flynn did nearly a dozen films together including ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939), and ""Dodge City"" (1939). In 1940 alone they produced 3 films - ""Virginia City"",  ""The Sea Hawk"", and ""Santa fe Trail"".

In almost every case, Flynn and de Havilland were the love interests and in almost every case the film centered around Flynn's swashbuckling. For ""Light Brigade"", however, Curtiz broke the mold that was so successful. De Havilland is in love with Flynn's brother (Patric Knowles), not Flynn, and Flynn spends almost the entire movie giving orders, riding on a horse, dancing, and doing just about anything except fighting. To top it off, Flynn dies in the end, and films in which Flynn died  (e.g., ""Elizabeth and Essex"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"") were never as successful as films in which he lived (""Captain Blood"", ""Robin Hood"", The Sea Hawk"")

Although Olivia de Haviland made 9 films with Errol Flynn between 1938 and 1943, it's her work without Flynn for which she received the most accolades. We remember her best in ""GWTW"" (1939) for which she was nominated for an Oscar. She was nominated again in 1941 for ""Hold Back the Dream"" and won for ""To Each Her Own"" (1947) and ""The Heiress"" (1949). She won Best Actress by the National Board of Review, the New York Film Criticis, and the Venice Film festival for her role as a mental patient in ""The Snake Pit"" (1949).

Henry Stephenson is everyone's favorite uncle. He started in the silent era and often played opposite Flynn as a Governor, Lord, or Duke in films such as ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Prince and the Pauper"" (1937), and ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). He appeared in several Tarzan movies as an archeologist or explorer. He plays Sir Charles Macefield.

Donald Crisp appeared in more than 150 films from 1908 through 1963. He won Best Supporting Actor for ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) and gave memorable performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935),  ""Jezebel"" (1938), and ""National Velvet"" (1944). He often worked with Flynn in films such as ""Dawn Patrol"" (1938), ""Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), and ""The Long Gray Line"" (1955). He plays the hapless Colonel Campbell, de Havilland's father.

Imposing Nigel Bruce appeared in more than 75 films, and he's best known as Dr. Watson to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes in the series of 14 films they made from 1939 to 1946. He plays Sir Benjamin Warrenton.

A young David Niven makes a brief appearance in the film. Flynn and Niven were great friends and shared a house together. Niven won an Oscar for ""Separate Tables"" (1959) and a Golden Globe for ""The Moon is Blue"" (1953), but he's probably best known for his role as Phileas Fogg in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956).

J. Carrol Naish was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Sahara"" in 1941, ""A Medal for
Benny"" in 1946). He was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (""The Whirlwind""), a Russian (""""British Agent""), an Arab (""The Crusades""),  an Asian (""The Hatchet Man"") and a Latino (""The Kid from Spain""). He played the lead role in ""Sitting Bull"" (1954). Naish plays an Indian lancer.

Though Curtiz did a lot of work with Flynn,  and was nominated for their first collaboration ""Captain Blood"", Curtiz received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney (""Angels with Dirty Faces"" in 1938 and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" in 1941) and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"" in 1942), one of eight they made together. Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared ""The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself.""

The music by Max Steiner is oppressive. The ""in your face"" melodramatic film scores work well when the action is in your face, but in a film that has such little action, Steiner's score is unnerving. Steiner could be great. He won 3 Oscars (""Since you Went Away"", ""Now Voyager"", and ""The Informer"") and was nominated for 18 more.

If you're a Flynn de Havilland fan, you probably should watch this film. You'll be disappointed, but you probably should watch it.",1280188800,,4465,4.809399477806789
433531,4,6302120616,"Warner Brothers covered the valorous 600 British cavalry of the Tennyson poem with glory in the studio's stirring tribute to the fearless assault at Balaklava in the face of sheer death. Although the final result of the charge was devastating, history has recorded the incident as a colossal blunder. Director Michael Curtiz and scenarists Michael Jacoby and Rowland Leigh mention the word 'blunder' only once during this black & white film's 116 running time. Indeed, they have changed up most of the names, except for Lord Raglan and the Crimean setting. The story itself is basically revenge motivated and Major Geoffrey Vickers (Errol Flynn of ""Captain Blood"") emerges as the hero who dies in battle after he runs a lance through the ruthless villain. Warner Brothers took some liberties with the subject matter, but then this was a big-budgeted spectacle and Curtiz films everything with gusto. The unfortunate part of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" is that some 200 horses died during the production. This real-life debacle prompted Congress draft legislation to protect livestock used in movies. Of course, Flynn plays the gallant hero who is so twisted by revenge that he writes orders contrary to Lord Raglan's orders so his regiment can kill the unscrupulous villain, Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon of ""The Crusades""), because he massacred their friends in India.

The opening 90-minutes of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" sets up the pay off during last quarter hour. The first half of the action occurs in 1854 in India. The film shows Captain Geoffrey Vickers distinguishing himself against a hostile tribe of armed warriors that out number his troops by creating a ruse. The attacking tribe of riflemen spot clouds of dust rising on the horizon, and Vickers' trickery fools them into believing that a relief column is in route so they retreat. Later, Vickers saves the life of Surat Khan during a leopard hunt when a leopard surprises the defenseless Khan and tries to kill him. Khan promises Vickers that he will repay him. Meanwhile, the treacherous Khan has other devious things up his sleeve. When the storm clouds of war gather about an hour later, the garrison commander of Fort Chukoti, Colonel Campbell (Donald Crisp of ""Mutiny on the Bounty""), receives orders to send off the better part of the garrison for maneuvers to impress the enemy. This leaves the garrison seriously undermanned. Major Vickers, promoted for getting his men out of the earlier predicament in the desert, protests, but Campbell assures him that they have more than enough men to protect the women and children. Little does Campbell realize that Khan and his army are watching the regiment head off to Lohana. After the British troops have passed, Khan's men descend from the mountains and launch an attack on the garrison. The following day after the Khan's tribesmen have stormed the fort, the Khan arranges a truce. He sends for Vickers and offers to let him live in exchange for Vicker's act that saved the Khan's life. Naturally, Vickers refuses the offer and returns to the garrison. The surviving British soldiers, among with the wives and children of the dispatched troops, are massacred by the Khan. Of course, Vickers manages to escape on a raft with his sweetheart, Commander Campbell's daughter, Elsa (Olivia de Havilland of ""Gone with the Wind""), and they alert the British army. Nevertheless, when Vickers and a relief column commanded by Sir Benjamin Warrenton (Nigel Bruce of ""The Pearl of Death"") makes it to the garrison, they find everybody else dead, including Campbell.

Vickers vows to catch up with Khan and kill him, but he has other troubles to face. Vicker's younger brother Captain Perry Vickers (Patric Knowles of ""The Devil's Brigade"") has fallen in love with his older brothers fiance Else. Of course, Colonel Campbell bristles at this treachery on the part of Vicker's brother and his daughter. Incredibly, Else prefers Perry to Geoffrey. Eventually, Geoffrey comes to realize that Else genuinely loves Perry and he can do nothing to change her mind. War erupts between the British and the French against the Russians in the Crimean. The British have laid siege to Sebastopol. When Sir Charles Macefield (Henry Stephenson of ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"") dictates orders to Vickers, he calls for a retreat. Vickers knows that the Surat Khan is with the Russians. India, it seems, was not big enough for Khan to hide from the authorities so he has joined the Russians. Vickers writes a second set of orders that direct the 27th Lancers to attack the guns. He confronts Perry with a dispatch that must be delivered in person to Macefield. As much as Perry hates the prospect of missing a battle, he takes the note to Macefield. Basically, Vickers has saved his younger brother from the suicidal charge. The dispatch that Macefield receives contains Vickers' admission of guilt that he changed the order. When the British make their valiant charge, the Russians open up with cannons, but the British reach the enemy lines and Vickers plunges a lance into the Khan.

During the production of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" the filmmakers relied on trip wires to topple the horses and some 200 horses died. This was indeed a terrible price to pay for this recreation of British history. Mind you, Errol is excellent and Curtiz never lets the action wear out its welcome. The production values are top-notch. David Niven plays a British officer who dies during the Khan's attack on Chukoti. Curtiz comes up with many interesting camera angles during the battle scenes that give the action a larger-than-life feel. Curtiz is ably supported by a great score from ""King Kong"" composer Max Steiner. If the subject of this military blunder whets your appetite, you should check out director Tony Richardson's superlative, historically accurate version, ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1968).",1278288000,,5911,5.029591836734694

The acting is great with the second pairing of Olivia and Errol.  No money was spared building the Indian forts.  The action scenes are full and quite bloody for the period and it takes a strong person not to get misty when the troops come back to the massacred outpost.  The music by Max Steiner is filled with memorable melodies--especially the first dance with Flynn and Olivia--and the march for the Lancers.
The film, with all this going for it, makes a great text book on how to write for the movies.  Most people know that the charge was a horrible mistake, but this film paints it as a massive act of revenge.  In order to do this, almost every scene must be written and acted in such a way that the audience will accept the actions of Flynn sending the Lancers into the Russian artillery and to their deaths.

433557,4,6302120616,"For some reason, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (directed in 1936 by Michael Curtiz) is always forgotten when people talk about Errol Flynn's movies.  It's one of the all-time greats for Flynn, in which he plays gallant Major Vickers, an officer in the 27th Lancers, whose personal story entwines with the horrors of the Crimean War.

Major Geoffrey Vickers (Errol Flynn) is engaged to lovely Elsa Campbell (Olivia de Havilland), the daughter of one of his superiors (Donald Crisp).  Unbeknowst to Geoffrey, Elsa has also fallen in love with his younger brother Perry (Patric Knowles).  This stormy love triangle is set against the violent conflict in the Crimean.  When the British outpost of Chukoti is stormed and all the occupants massacred by the bloodthirsty forces of Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon), Geoffrey and Elsa narrowly escape with their lives.  Geoffrey then leads the members of the 27th Lancers into the fray, determined to avenge those who needlessly perished in Chukoti...

Based around the famed poem by Tennyson (and loosely modeled on factual events), THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE was the first pairing of Flynn and de Havilland following their celebrated debut in the previous years' ""Captain Blood"" (and also directed by Michael Curtiz).  The film's showstopping highlight is the Light Brigade charge itself; a hair-raising, nine minute sequence which earned second unit director Jack Sullivan a specially-awarded Oscar.  So many horses were either seriously injured or killed in this sequence that the American Humane Association brought in new laws for treating animals in motion pictures.

Maybe the reason why CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE fails to be mentioned in the same breath as ""Captain Blood"" or ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" is because it is much more than a swashbuckler, and it's meaning runs a lot deeper than most Flynn vehicles.  This is a grand historical epic with passion and pride; it's certainly a movie to revisit again and again.",1202601600,5,1974,5.118380062305296

433596,4,6302120616,"Warner Bros. and Michael Curtiz faced a real challenge with their 1936 epic The Charge of the Light Brigade: how to solve the problem of turning the biggest fiasco in British military history into a heroic adventure? Why, ignore history entirely and make it all up instead, of course! Unfortunately, it doesn't quite pull it off, because no matter how entertaining the first hundred minutes are, there's no getting around the stupidity of Donald Crisp's commanding officer or the criminal irresponsibility of Errol Flynn's actions in the last reel, no matter how `noble' his intentions. Nor is it easy to accept the truly vicious horsefalls in the final charge, no matter how spectacular the sequence, although at least the huge number of horses killed in the sequences (along with one stuntman) led to laws being passed to protect animals in films.

Despite the title, the film takes its lead from the previous year's The Lives of a Bengal Lancer and is more interested in revolting natives on the Indian frontier than it is in the Crimean War, with Flynn's dashing cavalry officer surprisingly losing Olivia De Havilland's hand to his brother Patric Knowles while failing to avert a massacre masterminded by C. Henry Gordon's treacherous Surat Khan. The Charge itself is here an act of revenge rather than a ghastly blunder, and is portrayed as the turning point in the war rather than a wasted heroic gesture. But then, when Tony Richardson offered a more historically accurate version in 1968, audiences stayed at home in droves, so the studio clearly knew what they were doing by going for romantic hokum, and darn entertaining hokum at that.

(Incidentally, the theme of animal cruelty is continued in the 1936 Porky Pig cartoon Boom Boom included on the DVD, a bizarre, tasteless - but in an unfunny way - spoof of WW1 that delights in killing animals with high explosives for the first half of its running time!)

The extras are good but a little unsatisfying compared to other Errol Flynn titles: this is one film where a documentary would have been particularly useful, but aside from the Warners Night at the Movies selected shorts and an audio commentary, the only extra relating to the film itself is a reissue trailer - a pity since even the original four-minute theatrical trailer included a lot of behind-the-scenes footage.",1180310400,4,2340,4.934010152284264

It does not seem that Warner Brothers is going to release any more Errol Flynn titles anytime soon. It is in English and you can turn the Portuguese subtitle off. It is not a high quality transfer and it skips a lot throughout.

All that being said, this is one of Errol Flynn's early and best action movies during the early part of his career. It is a fictionalized account of the famous charge of the British lancers and in my opinion a lot more interesting than the later version with Gielgould which although more accurate historically, the action is terrible. Flynn is at his best and the movie direction is excellent.

But that was the common way of doing things then. As for the acting, Errol Flynn is a dashing figure and even his death in the movie has dignity. Personally, I hate his brother (for stealing his girl while he was away), and his former fiance for hurting this hero. She is as much at fault for his death as the enemy. His broken heart definitely leads him in part to his destructive, suicidal end. As a child I loved this film and thru out my 40+ years, I have tried to view it whenever it shows. I obtained a video copy which is very worn now. All I need to say is BRING IT TO DVD. I thought it would be in Errol Flynn's box set recently released but was disappointed not to see it there.

I would be truly surprised if opinions had before and after perhaps even over time where at one point the Charge of the Light Brigade was a new release had not already met some of the demands that I feel compelled to put to paper even today,so many years hence. This is a very good film,truly it enters into the heart with dramatic license that I could not ignore. The English if you will are portrayed as a stuff shirt that ignores terrible problems,things can get very frustrating in particular for Flynn when he questions Englands diplomacy when the Surat Khan is about to lose a stipend of considerable worth. The are many overtures of impending crisis that though perhaps questioned by Flynn they are overridden by superiors. What a truly terrible,terrible event occured when the fort was left poorly manned with only a handful of brave souls to guard her gates. The blood thirsty Surat Khan had no shame even upon the women and the children and even those whose only defense was the inspired word of the Holy Bible. It is one of the defining moments and the catalyst to glory. Forever in the annals of the Light Brigade this will burn till they exact an eye for an eye and gain victory over this monster,the Surat Khan. The film moves into some territory where Flynns brother portrayed as something of a globetrotter in the Service of the Queen stirs up controversy with improper advances toward Olivia DeHaviland,who it turns out is to be betrothed to Captain Vickers(flynn)I do not care for this side light,indeed her Father in the film perhaps had the very right idea about this affair wanting to have this fellow horsewipped. It was uncharacteristic of the events that were about to unfold to have such a weak willed love affair not be forever based. Flynns contribution is in the Name of Her Majesty the Queen and to the glory of the Light Brigade. He is a very capable officer and worthy of the Lead. Perhaps that Affair might learn something from what is most important to us in this world,because Captain Vickers exemplifies that. To borrow from one of the other great films of Errol Flynn,""His men would follow him to hell"",and thats what materializes when the Surat Khan is found to be incamped with the Russian forces at the Balakava Heights. The position is thought to be virtually impenetrable. The other area that underpins the heartfelt care I pay to this film came from one of Englands great romantic poets in Sir Alfred Lord Tennyson. Into the Valley of Death rode the 600! Truly great storytelling and a victory over a monster. Long Live Her Majesty the Queen of England and Glory forever be with the Light Brigade.

433619,5,6302120616,"Well, it wasn't called the golden age of Hollywood for nothing. If you love the grand style of a Hollywood epic, get this movie. First, it has Errol Flynn, who was born to be a star in the classic age of Hollywood. He was handsome, athletic, and had a tremendous energy and youthful spirit that faded all too quickly. There was also a strange quality to his screen presence that flashed whenever he smiled, a generous, happy style that wished only happiness for everyone. Also, he could actually be ""heroic"" in a grand way, which is a blending of valor, physical prowess, and blinding smile in the face of overwhelming odds. In short, here was someone men would follow into danger, even death (a quality very hard to find in any screen era).
Flynn was also a better actor than many give him credit for. In this performance, and his acting in Dawn Patrol (Edmund Goulding, 1938), he has a convincing, sad resignation that never fails to be moving. In this film, he was directed by Michael Curtiz, who with his talent for epic action was the perfect director for Flynn. Curtiz, in fact, directed Flynn's best vehicles with Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood.
The cast is also excellent: Olivia de Havilland plays is love interest, as she did in so many films, and Nigel Bruce shines as the wife-harried Sir Benjamin Warrenton. My favorite piece of acting comes from Henry Stephenson, who portrays the diplomat/soldier Sir Charles Macefield. Stephenson's performance sets just the right tone of authority, shrewdness, and military intractability (he is also given some of the best dialogue in the film). Patric Knowles is fine as the ramrod straight brother, and David Niven brings his usual panache as the friend of Flynn (a part he perfected a couple of years later in Dawn Patrol).
Finally, this film has the greatest horse-soldiers in full charge ever put to film.  The editing and physical energy of the scene has to be seen to be appreciated. This is filmmaking to give you chills, and I guarantee you, you will be cheering the brave 600 onward throughout the scene as they charge through the valley of death.
This is a bit of a neglected classic and cries out for a DVD restoration.",1057536000,6,2198,4.723958333333333
433620,5,6302120616,"This classic movie is based VERY losely on History.  At least Hollywood didn't go out of its way to appear accurate and not be so, as it often does pretenciously today.  This movie is sheer entertainment with faint resemblences of history.  The massacre portrayed of the garrison in India is losely based on an incident during the Seapoy Mutiny of 1857. Here the Indian mutineers crually did what is shown in the movie more or less.
Of course there was no Captain Vickers, or 27th Lancers, although they can pass for the 17th Lancers who were in the actual charge.  This movie is a visual delight, and is a fast passed epic. The costumes and uniforms are reasonably accurate, which is pretty good for those days. Flynn is his usual dashing self, and a tender looking David Niven in his first role is amusing to see.  Although I care more for how a movie presents history as opposed to who acts in it, I do give both of these actors as well as de Haviland credit for a good job.  They all fit their roles nicely.
The true highlight of this film is of course the famous Charge against the Russian Don Cossack Horse Artillery Battery, which is portrayed looking like an entire army here!  Still, the charge sequence for all that is superb, with really painful looking falls for the extras as well as the horses.  Many horses were hurt shoting this film, and rules toward better treatment of them were revisesd as a result.  But in those days people and animals took second place to movie making history!  Today we have technology and computer graphics to spare all the hardships of yesturday.  See this film for the heyday of epic film making, even though the history is whacked, I don't mind! And neither should you. Compared to the Politically Correct stuff that is mostly done today it is refreshing.  For an interesting comparison check out the British re-make of the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1968.  You will hardly find two movies more unlike each other!

433621,5,6302120616,"When a film is as rousing and entertaining as CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, the only ones who truly care about the historical inaccuracies and anachronisms are the purists of history.  CLB succeeds admirably as gripping spectacle but fails miserablly as literal truth.  The most glaring error relates to the charge itself, surely ranking right up there with Moses' splitting of the Red Sea as memorable spectacle.  The historical charge was the result of human error, but given the then contemporary world scene, a charge that resulted in such catastrophic casualties could not be motivated by an erroneous pen stroke. Instead, that pen stroke is seen as the final culmination of a cycle of revenge that begins innocently enough when British Captain Geoffery Vickers (Errol Flynn) saves the life of a roguish ruler of 'Suristan', Surat Khan, (read Afghanistan) oily played by C. Henry Gordon. Surat Khan makes a peace treaty with England only to later traitorously ally himself with England's bitter enemy, Russia. He orders the massacre of all the inhabitants (mostly women and children) at the fortress of Chukoti but spares Vickers' life as compensation.  Vickers makes the killing of Surat Khan his life's work, and at the war between England and Russia in the Crimea, he sees his chance.  He discovers orders requiring the Light Brigade to retreat, but rewrites those orders and falsifies his superior's handwriting, thus allowing him and his Light Brigade to attack. The attack is an extended piece of filming that should be studied by anyone in Film 101 who wants to learn how to blend sight and sound to rouse the emotions.  First, Vickers addresses the troops.  He reminds them that 'No one should be permitted to massacre women and children and live to boast of it. Up there (he points to the Balaklava heights).  Our Objective, Surat Khan!'  As the Light Brigade slowly advances, Tennyson's poem flashes line by line on the screen.  The sprightly cadences of the poem exactly match the increasing speed of the horses.  As the bugler sounds the 'Charge,' the lancers lower their spears in a full gallop.  The camera retreats to view the charge from a panoramic distance, suggesting that the charge is an irresistable tidal wave of men, horses, and oncoming death.  When Surat Khan sees this, he knows they are coming for him, but in the best tradition of Snidely Whiplash, boasts: 'The fools! Our batteries will cut them to ribbons in a crossfire.'  Sadly enough, he is not far wrong.  One by one, the lancers are blown off their horses.  One dismounted trooper holds out the Brigade's pennant, allowing another to snatch it up and continue the charge, which soon enough establishes that justice will prevail, even at a fearsome cost.
  THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE is one of the most emotionally satisfying movies of that or any other era.  Not only does the bad guy (Surat Khan) get his just punishment, but the outcome also serves to suggest an allegory of contemporay events.  The leader of the Russians, Count Volonoff, is a dead ringer for Joseph Stalin, and any victory over the coming clouds of despotism that were clearly evident even in 1936 served to remind the world that movies can be as entertaining as they are instructive.",1028505600,6,3250,4.906764168190128

7822002,5,6302120616,"Another great Michael Curtiz film including the heroics of Errol Flynn, romance with Havilland (although this time Flynn doesn't keep the girl), great battle scenes that Curtiz was well-known for, the nasty villain, and a little bit of politics thrown in to remind the audience that the main event really took place albeit the characters in the film are fictional. Although the DVD is not made of same material in which others used to be done, the film has the same pristine quality for a film of this period. The only drawback that it does not play with regular DVD/Blu-ray players. I could see it by connecting my TV to the laptop. Enjoyable film.",1524960000,,649,4.701754385964913
