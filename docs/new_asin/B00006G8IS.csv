1757713,5,B00006G8IS,"Someone under this has given this set ONE star for reasons of not having seen it!! I hope Amazon will delete this nonsense, because this gives people the wrong idea. This set is ESSENTIAL for every serious movie collector, everyone who likes to look a bit further than there noses are, everyone enjoying a good film, everyone with a sense of humor and everyone with something even remotely resembling some good taste. THE TOXIC AVENGER is one of the greatest creations in film history, his adventures in Lloyd Kaufman's films some of the most unique ever committed to cellulloid. This set contains the first three of Toxie's films PLUS a disc full of otherwise unavailable adventures of the animated spin-off THE TOXIC CRUSADERS, probably Troma's most successfull franchise to date. This fourth disc is worth the price of the set alone, add the other THREE films (and all of this loaded with extra's, as is Troma's custom) and this is the best buy on DVD of the millennium.
To get ready for the soon-to-be dvd-release of Lloyd Kaufman's ultimate masterpiece (and he has made quite a few) THE TOXIC AVENGER PART IV: CITIZEN TOXIE, the Tox Box is an essential MUST-buy. Forget all the prejudiced criticisms about Troma: it is one of the most innovative and original filmcompanies, and the longest in business of all independants. And still creating unique works of art.
Get this box - you won't regret it.",1031184000,14,1403,4.825726141078838
1757788,3,B00006G8IS,"To be brief, the original movie is an excellent cult-classic B-movie fans.  The other films should not have been made.  I couldn't even watch more than 15 minutes of the third movie.  Part 3 was almost as bad as Van Helsing.",1126483200,2,224,4.414634146341464
1757789,5,B00006G8IS,"The Toxic Avenger is a masterpiece from Troma while the sequels are decent the first is a classic.

The Toxic Avenger-*****-Entertaining black comedy features a nerdy janitor that is picked on and accidentally falls into toxic waste and becomes a hero around Tromaville and then the fun starts. The Mexican restaraunt scene is a classic as well as the head crushing scene. Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz are geniuses.

The Toxic Avenger part 2-**- Don't really remember this one too well but the plot has Toxie(aka Melvin) in Japan.

The Toxic Avenger part 3:The Last Temptation of Toxie- So-so chapter has Toxie working for a company called Apocalypse to help get his blind girlfriend her eyesight back and soon discovers the boss is a devilish villian. The movie store scene is another classic where punks try robbing it and one of those punks get there hand in the VHS rewinder and the close-up of the hand being grinded and then Toxie gets a mop and jams in his head and twists his head right off and blood squirts everywhere. Overall the Toxic Avenger movies are watchable B-movies with good production values and excellent special effects.",1106352000,2,1145,4.861538461538461

1757791,5,B00006G8IS,"The Toxic Avenger, the crown jewel of Tromaville Productions. Melvin certainly has come a long way. From a hot blind girlfriend at the dump (Who does her makeup anyway?), to Japan and cooking villians in the bathhouse. The Toxic Avenger is a dynamite, soul brother, action adventure for the whole family. Seriously, what other movie has a leotard wearing freak pointing a double barreled shotgun at a baby? Or a chick masturbating to pictues of bodies her boyfriend ran over? How do you fight with fish? Can you windsail from New Jersey to Japan? How many people can Toxie fight at once? All these and many more questions are answered. Buy this now or live a miserable and empty life.",1078358400,7,684,4.708333333333333

1757794,4,B00006G8IS,"This box-set is a really good deal, considering what you get: TOXIC AVENGER, TOXIC AVENGER 2, TOXIC AVENGER 3, and TOXIC CRUSADER THE MOVIE ....)
This set would get a 5 if it weren't for the stereotypical cartoon(an above average show, but nothing special) and the ""me-too"" TOXIC AVENGER 2. That said, The first and third movies are great films, funny and sharp, and Troma's DVD extras are the best in the DVD market, so that more than makes up for it. ...",1043539200,2,456,4.506024096385542
1757795,5,B00006G8IS,Well to start off this box set is wonderful. I have seen the films on vhs when I was 12 or 13. I have seen Toxic Avenger 3 when I was 16. So it has been awhile. I know my parents bought the box set for me for Christmas. If you have not seen any of these films do so by watching The Toxic Avenger first. I also remember watching the cartoon series. It is a good show it still is. I used to have some of the action figures somewhere but lost them. There was also a new Toxie movie coming out March 18 2003 so that would be a kick ass movie. All in all the Tox Box is a really good set to have. Toxie rules!!!,1040688000,,606,3.705426356589147
1757796,5,B00006G8IS,"The Toxic Avenger 1 is one of the greatest movies ever made.
The uncut version of Toxic Avenger 2 is worth the money for it alone because the ""Unrated Directors Cut"" sold seperatly was, in reality, the R-rated version and sucked.
Toxic 3 wasn't that good, but it had an exellent begining and ending (the middle is pure bordom.)
Toxic Crusaders was a childrens movie and is basically the first four episodes of the TV series.
This set is essential to all fans of Troma movies.",1033776000,3,475,4.534883720930233
1757797,5,B00006G8IS,"I agree with most of what Ton says about Toxic Avenger and the sequels. Is it a masterpiece? Yes! Is it a classic? Yeah! Is it a fun movie? Definately!! It's a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants movie that has cute chicks and off the wall violence. What more do you want in a popcorn movie? The sequels are just as fun to watch. Here's a synopsis I found on The Toxic Avenger Website:
The Toxic Avenger is a thrilling, one-of-a-kind, action-packed film loaded with adventure, horror, science-fiction and unforgettable big-budget special effects. Welcome to Tromaville, New Jersey-a small American town, which is being terrorized by criminals while the town's corrupt mayor sits idly by. Muggers, robbers and teenage punks run rampant as the citizens are helplessly victimized.
Among the residents of Tromaville is Melvin, a skinny, weak, wimp of a young man. Melvin is the janitor at the local health club, and as he goes about his daily menial tasks, he is forever teased, taunted and tormented by the strong, ""beautiful"" men and women of the club. That is, until Melvin becomes THE TOXIC AVENGER!!!!!
A particularly nasty group of Melvin's tormentors devise a plot to embarrass and ridicule him in front of the whole town. As fate would have it, the ""harmless"" prank turns into a horrible accident as Melvin crashes through a third story window and lands in a vat of hazardous toxic chemicals. The rest, as they say, is history! As the toxic chemicals take hold of Melvin's body, a strange and wonderful transformation begins to take place. Through the magic of spectacular state-of-the-art special effects, Melvin the weakling turns into the huge, hulking ""TOXIC AVENGER""-the first super-hero from New Jersey! The excitement is non-stop as this monstrous mess of mutated man sets out to single-handedly wipe out the forces of evil, which taint the town of Tromaville.
THE TOXIC AVENGER is non-stop entertainment that will leave viewers glowing from the fun!

Thanks Troma and keep making those movies!!
The Dude from Barbados has no right to write a review and rate the movie...he hasn't even seen the movie! How could you rate a movie one star? You haven't seen the bloody movie!! I find that somewhat disrespectful to the shoppers who haven't seen the movie and it's very disrespectful to those who have and love The Toxic Avenger. So next time, please do not rate and review a movie you have not seen. I do however sugest .. to get rid of his review and his stinking one star!",1032739200,9,2504,4.90566037735849

7968751,5,B00006G8IS,Well first off I love the toxic avenger movies I knew about them ever since I was a kid and just started watching them on the epix drive in channel needless to say I immediately wanted all of them to watch forever haha..but anywho I bought the used one and it didn't come with toxic crusaders it came with citizen toxie which is one better! I've never really been a cartoon guy,1376524800,,377,4.25

7968753,5,B00006G8IS,"From the first time I saw Toxic Avenger on satellite TV, I hoped there would be at least a sequel & there were several! I also wondered if they were available in a box set so I punched up amazon on my PC & there it was! I think the stories & details are hilarious! They run the gamut of humor from satire to slapstick. I would recommend this to anyone that's a Toxic Avenger fan (& the price is great, too!)",1348358400,,407,3.975609756097561
7968754,1,B00006G8IS,"I bought this because I saw the first Toxic Avenger and had heard this box set contained the only uncut version of Part II. Well it is uncut, but a little extra gore could not save the god awful Toxic Avenger 2 from sucking. I don't even know how I managed to sit through the first 20 minutes of part 3. To my surprise, it was almost as bad. Top it off with that crappy Toxic Crusaders cartoon that has NO redeeming qualities and you've got yourself a wasted $40. Get the first Toxic Avenger, avoid the sequels and that garbage cartoon. If you really need a Troma fix get Tromeo and Juliet (It is the best Troma movie I've seen, better than TA1) or Class of Nuke 'Em High.",1320364800,2,672,4.176923076923077
7968755,5,B00006G8IS,"Troma is an excellent company. There dvds are stuffed full of great dvd extras and the menus are always fun to watch. While Tox Box is out of print and hard to find cheap, I picked it up anyways. The movies says its full of gore but the first one isn't really gruesome. The storyline is easy to follow and it can be funny. I cant understand why they didn't put part 4 in the set instead of a cartoon movie. The Toxic Avenger is a pretty good buy. All the movies are campy and fun. I highly recommend watching the series.",1189987200,,520,4.107843137254902
