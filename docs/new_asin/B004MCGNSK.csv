4429627,1,B004MCGNSK,"Warning: If you already own the ""Jurassic Fight Club - Season 1"" box set, do not purchase this as it is the EXACT same programs in a shiny new package. Now don't get me wrong, if you are into dinosaurs as much as I am, then you will enjoy the programs here as they are excellent documentaries with lots of cool CGI Dino footage. But I am only giving this set a 1 star rating as I already own JFC-S1 and nowhere in the description was it mentioned that this is the same program. If you search Amazon for Jurassic Fight Club you will find it for much cheaper than this. At the time of this review Jurassic Fight Club is selling for about 1/3 the price of this set. So my advice is to avoid this and get JFC instead!",1307232000,22,713,4.0638297872340425

8435908,5,B004MCGNSK,"My dad just got me this for my 20th birthday, and as an avid fan of Jurassic Fight Club I am quite happy to have it in my collection and join Walking With Dinosaurs. I enjoyed seeing this show when it played, however, I have not seen most of these episodes, so these are all interesting.

As a warning, I will say this: The graphics are decent on some animals, however, they are not the best. Keep in mind, they would not have had a large budget for amazing CGI.

I do see how it is annoying to other buyers to think this is something else and then end up with a copy of  JFC, however, as a fan and first-time owner, I am thrilled. If you do not own JFC and want to, go with this. For a first time owner, its good and fun. If you do own Jurassic Fight Club already, just pass this on by, or get it for a family member to tell your copies apart xD",1392163200,,846,3.9069767441860463
8435909,4,B004MCGNSK,Poor graphics for a 2010+ video. Other than that it isn't bad. Less documentary info and more dinosaur behavior and interaction.,1390953600,,128,5.142857142857143

8435911,3,B004MCGNSK,"This is actually a collection of Jurassic Fight Club episodes. I thought it was a collection of different dinosaur/paleontology documentaries, but they just repackaged Fight Club. I was very very disappointed at the beginning as, 1: why didn't they just put ""Jurassic Fight Club"" anywhere on the front or back of the case or on the discs themselves?? 2: the CG is horrible in this (for my personal favorite dino CG stuff see Planet Dinosaur and Dinosaur Revolution...amazing) 3: the science is alright, entertaining, educational and informative, just aimed at kids despite the graphic nature of the program. So this is really a review for Jurassic Fight Club, but I was mislead.",1342310400,,678,5.0625
8435912,5,B004MCGNSK,"This is a very nice array of documentaries put together for a very good price. If you read these reviews you would think that jurassic fight club repackaged in a set like this is a horrible thing. Many of these history classics sets are really bad but as far as dinosaur documentaries go this one really hits home..Your looking a 10 hours of jurassic fight club documentaries for a very competitive price, they are all very very informative and entertaining.. This deserves a 5 for entertainment value alone because Jurassic fight club is some of the better documentaries available that couple scientific detail with a very nice flair of the dramatic captured in really breathtaking CGI..

I don't know about anyone else but I really hate yawning dinosaur documentaries that are overflowed with science and none of the new capability of CGI to show what these monsters really looked like and what they could do..It is a very nice ad on especially for the younger to grab their attention and keeps them interested without actually skipping the scientific facts..You get your moneys worth here, Jurassic fight club is not a bad set and they really put together a very nice set for under twenty bucks..What are people complaining so much for, they have never went this low in price for these documentaries so how can you complain about this set being released for 15 bucks because that's what I paid for it..The one reference to this set was also 70 dollars so for what it is I don't think this set deserves anything less than 5 stars, there are some pretty bad dinosaur documentaries out there, this is one of the better ones. Here's a list of dinosaurs covered in this set, not bad for a few bucks if you ask me

Majungasaurus, albertasaurus ,Nanotyrannus, Arctodus

Raptor, allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, megalodon

utahraptor, majungatholus, Albertosaurus, Pachyrhinosaurus

Edmontosaurus, Dromaeosaurus",1334966400,2,1899,4.996835443037975
8435913,4,B004MCGNSK,I love dinosaurus every since i was little this movie helped me watch dinosaurus fight and such and learned battle stragies of what dinosaurus used to survive it is a great movie. :),1327795200,,182,4.545454545454546
8435914,4,B004MCGNSK,"I feel it necessary to warn all potential buyers that this is one and the same as Series one of Jurassic Fight Club. I brought this because of the outside packaging and assumed it was all new material. I had purchased Jurassic Fight club a year or so ago. If you have JFC already, do NOT get this because it is the same material exactly. However, it should be cheaper because the four discs are contained in one DVD case. JF Club has the same four DVDs, but each in a separate case. Since they wanted to keep packaging costs down, so then the price should be lower too. I believe you can still find JF Club on Amazon for less than this. If you liked watching Jurassic Fight Club on the history channel and want to own it, here it is. I feel the History channel should have kept the original title so potential buyers would know what they are getting. As it stands, a lot of Dino fans are going to buy duplicate material, because the outside of the box does not acknowledge the series(unless you remember the names of individual episodes which are listed). So if you have JFC already, skip it. If you do not own it and want it, get it, that is if you do not mind having all the discs crammed into one case, AMEN.",1310256000,11,1211,4.224137931034483
