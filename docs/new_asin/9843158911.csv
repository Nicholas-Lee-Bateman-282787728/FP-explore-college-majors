7901786,2,9843158911,"One might assume from the several 'Five Star reviews' of this movie posted on Amazon that it is some sort of unheralded Russian motion picture 'masterpiece' deserving mention alongside Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' (1985), Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Ivan's Childhood' (1962) and Grigoriy Chukhray's 'Ballad of a Soldier' (1959).  But any such assumption would be wrong.  'Trial on the Road' is an uninteresting product of the Soviet motion picture production bureaucracy released during the waning years of the former USSR.  Its script and characters are shallow and transparently designed to deliver a conventional Soviet Communist Party message about the nature of 'patriotism' as defined in accordance with the former USSR's Communist Party Line.  The film's performances, photography, editing and direction are nothing to brag about either - they are merely workmanlike, but no more and occasionally less than that.

So why all those 'rave reviews'?  Why that very high '8.0 star' rating currently posted for the movie on IMDB?  And also, what is the name of the releasing entity that is responsible for issuing this rather odd NTSC DVD-R release and also the several parallel releases of other Aleksey German films, all NTSC DVD-R's with covers printed entirely in Russian and with English language subtitles on the discs?  The Amazon listings for these releases do not state who or what the releasing entity is, but I think we can guess.  I think it works for Vladimir Putin, as probably do also the authors of those multiple 'Five Star reviews' and whatever group of IMDB 'voters' are responsible for this film's current greatly overstated '8.0' IMDB rating.

I was given a copy of this release as a gift by a well-intentioned friend who was trying to find a 'great movie' about which I had not heard.  My friend read about 'Trial on the Road' in a paid advertising supplement to The Washington Post - a multi-page supplement that the Russian Government periodically produces and pays The Post to distribute along with the newspaper.  That tells you something, doesn't it?

So my final question is this:  Why does Vladimir Putin want all Americans to watch this and other undistinguished Soviet propaganda movies from the bygone days of the USSR?  Isn't it enough for him simply to succeed in effectively appointing, more or less, the current President of the United States?  I mean really, what more does the man want from us?  But perhaps we can guess the answer to that as well.",1485907200,,2480,5.0244498777506115

7901788,5,9843158911,"A masterpiece. A Greek tragedy set in the snow-covered forests of USSR during WW2 - The Great Patriotic War, as it is known to the Russian. It is about ordinary people caught in the wheels of fate, fate they cannot escape. ""I did not choose this fate, it choose me"";  the words of the protagonist just about sum it up.
It is a war film, and the war is brutally depicted in masterfully choreographed fighting scenes. But first of all it is the story of human tragedy and the inescapable chain of events leading to it.",1451865600,2,516,4.375
