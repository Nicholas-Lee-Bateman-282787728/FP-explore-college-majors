and there it was.  I bought it for my husband who loved the Sid Caesar show and he loves it.

5003626,5,B006LOLQ5W,"How amazing it must have been, with all these comic geniuses working together.  They were so funny, after so many years, that it made me want to find recordings of Sid Caesar's ""Show of Shows"" to prolong the pleasure.",1373673600,,217,4.564102564102564
5003627,5,B006LOLQ5W,"When this first appeared on PBS many years ago, it was described by a critic as ""gold plated"". It is.",1366502400,2,101,4.1
5003628,5,B006LOLQ5W,"If you don't laugh yourself out of your chair while you're watching this video, you're dead. This is Sid Caesar, folks,  with some of his legendary ""dream team"" of writers -- some of the best comic brains in the business - reminiscing about the days when they created comedy that, sixty years later, is still funnier than any of today's so called comedy.

Here are the Simon Brothers --- Neil and Danny plus Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Mel Tolkin, Aaron Ruben, Gary Belzer, Sheldon Keller, with a cameo appearance by Howard Morris -- telling stories about working with Caesar, reviving bits and sketches, and  talking about creating comedy under incredible time deadlines. Remember --- ""Your Show of Shows"" was ninety minutes, live. No retakes, no video. If a mistake happened, it went out on the air. Of course, many times, thanks to Sid Caesar's genius for ad libbing, that wasn't always necessarily bad. There's the Pagliacci spoof when Caesar's make up pen broke unexpectedly -- and Caesar ad libbed the mistake into comedic legend. (Don't believe me? Get hold of the separate DVDs of Caesar's sketches and you can see the Pagliacci spoof, the pen break, and Caesar's response to it for yourself.)

The best part of this video is that, as Reiner puts it, it gives you a sense of what the Writer's Room was really like, with each of these comic minds talking over each other, trying to top each other's ideas, and arguing about what constitutes funny. For instance, why is ""twenty-three"" funnier than ""thirty-three?"" Neil Simon, Carl Reiner, and Mel Brooks tell you.

In 1996, the Writer's Guild of America West gathered Caesar and nine of his former writers together for a panel discussion, which, fortunately, the WGAW had the foresight to record and release, first on video tape, and now on this DVD. As you watch and listen to these geniuses, you'll understand why the Writer's Room has become the stuff of legend and why it has been depicted so often in film, tv, and theater. Reiner used it as the basis for the Dick Van Dyke Show; Brooks recreated it in the film he produced ""My Favorite Year""; and Neil Simon wrote an entire play about it --- ""Laughter on the 23rd Floor.""

This video becomes even more fascinating when one considers all of the great comedy that these writers went on to create after they left the Caesar show --- in fact, they influenced comedy for the latter half of the 20th century. Consider their achievements: ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" ""The Odd Couple,"" ""The Producers,"" ""Andy Griffith Show,"" ""All In the Family,"" --- and that's just a small sampling. To list all of the brilliant work these writers have done would triple, maybe even quadruple, the length of this review.

The only sad aspect of this video, seen today, is that so many of these geniuses have since left us -- Danny Simon, Mel Tolkin, Aaron Ruben, Sheldon Keller, Gary Belzer, and, yes, even Howard Morris. (Imogene Coca is also gone, as well as other Caesar writers, like Joseph Stein and Michael Stewart.) Well, thanks to the WGAW, at least we have this recording so they can still keep us doubled over with laughter.

I bought this originally on video tape back around 1996 and wore out three copies of the tape. Now, seeing it again on DVD, I'm going to have to buy extras, because I know I'm going to watch it so often I'll wear out the discs. So will you.",1356739200,9,3359,4.671742808798647
5003629,5,B006LOLQ5W,"Back in the day, Sid Caesar was the funniest man in the world. His TV show was truly ""must see TV"" before that phrase was invented or even dreamed about. As funny as Sid Caesar was, the reason his show was so great was because he had a crew of the greatest comedy writers in the history. If you can believe it, he had Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, Mel Tolkin, among others. This video captures a stage full of the brightest, most innovative comic minds in history telling stories, reminiscing about what it was like to be in the room with the funniest people in the world making the world's funniest comedy. And, not hard to believe, these guys are still funny and have great memories.

If you have a funny bone, you need this DVD. It's a time capsule and a rare peek inside the high pressure comedy writer's room of a top TV show. Years from now, I'm sure there will be a Daily Show or Colbert Report writer's DVD. Until then, grab this and get ready to laugh.

PS - don't take your eyes off Mel Brooks...",1354233600,4,1028,4.293814432989691

Knowing this was originally recorded for an old PBS special, I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality on my 60"" HDTV. It looks and sounds very good for its age.

Anytime I feel the need for an injection of humor, I put this on, and I feel better.  A great look into the ""inside"" of comedy writing.  Someone else complained about the fact that this differed from the PBS showing, the main difference being the absence of film clips from way back, but I think that to include them in this release probably would have raised some thorny legal issues. I myself am happy to see it, period.",1474934400,,534,4.32

8500431,3,B006LOLQ5W,"The writers assembled in this program are titanic.  However, for those of us who saw the original PBS show which was hosted by Billy Crystal this version is stripped of all the program inserts that made their stories hysterically funny.  For example, they talk about the famous German general who was dressed by Howard Morris and was really the doorman at a hotel, but on this show after they talk about it they do not play the example from the show which makes it work even better.  If you didn't see the show on PBS this is funny enough, perhaps, but don't expect the ""finished"" version here.
Incidentally, as I write this only three members of this august group of writers is alive today, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon and Mel Brooks.  PBS version 5 stars.",1463961600,,753,4.555555555555555

8500433,4,B006LOLQ5W,"Once upon a time, television was new and the comedy variety show was king. Among the teams that made this a fact was the comedy great Sid Ceasar and a team of comedy writers never before or since assembled in one place. In Caesars Writers a brace of some of the best-known names to have first served an apprenticeship on either Your Show of Shows and/or Caesars Hour are gathered to reminisce repeat some of their favorite bits and tell you how it all got started. These are decidedly not grumpy old man even if they have not entirely lost the desire to one up each other.

Caesars Writers is billed as a presentation of the writers Guild of America, West. If this is an example of the quality of their work I am going to seek out more DVDs from these folks. The facilitator of this on stage presentation is very clever at keeping himself in the background and providing just enough push to keep these guys going. Of course with the manic energy of the Mel Brooks there is rarely a need to keep them going. The more famous names like Larry Gelbart Carl Reiner and Neil Simon contribute as you would expect of these greats. Prior to the show I had not realized that Neil Simon had a brother Danny likewise I did not know that Sid and several others of these writers had enormous respect for heretofore unknown (to me) brother to Sid Caesar.
 And so it goes for a very fun two hours. I spontaneously correct combination of historic fact and personalities enlivened with repartee and comedy from the best in their class.

The obvious shortfall to this writers reunion is the practical impossibility of getting all of the still alive writers to be present on one stage at one time. I cannot be the only one hoping that a second effort will be made if only to get similar input from those unable to make a commitment for this day.

Caesars Writers is highly recommended as a family friendly, to our fun time. You may not have known anything about the original show or the original broadcasts but there are names on that stage that should have meaning. If you are not the kind of person to pay attention to who wrote, directed or produced your various entertainments, the good spirits in the easy laughter of these men will more than repay your investment in this DVD.",1447459200,,2262,4.469733656174334
8500434,5,B006LOLQ5W,This DVD is a treasure. I laughed from the beginning straight to the end.to watch these guys revel in each others company is a treat.and let me add...make sure you get the extended version..it's additional laughter..and who doesn't need that.,1445558400,,242,5.075
