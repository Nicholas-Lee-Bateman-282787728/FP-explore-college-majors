8288571,5,B001CQ5PDI,"First off Carnage cup 3 is a death match tournament from an Indy wrestling promotion IWA-DS,so if you're looking for WWE or TNA quality wrestling you will not find it here. This death match in particular has some pretty extremely violent  and gory moment's so it's not for the squeamish. I am a huge fan of deathmatch style wrestling and I thought overall this DVD is great,the DVD has a great menu where you can select matches and appears to be filmed by smart mark video with instant replays after every match.

the first match is UltraMantis black vs Sexxy  Eddy  vs Scotty Vortex with light tube table, barbed wire  board and barbed wire table match. The match is actually exceptionally great with lots of action I thoroughly enjoyed the UltraMantis character that shot a great promo after the match.

the next match is tank vs deranged vs Danny havoc in a unlucky 13 light tubes match.another good match that's a little slow paced overall but has lots of good spots throughout the match.

Next match is Drake Younger  vs Wacks vs viking in a light tube corners and bundles match.this is an awesome match with lots of action throughout the entire match and a spot at the end where wacks nearly rips off Drake younger ear.

Next  match is Ian rotten vs insane lane vs freakshow  in a home run  derby match.this is an extremely violent match with not much technical wrestling but lots of crimson masks and gore. These guys really don't hold back on each other, at one point freakshow has a hunk of flesh hanging from his forehead. Nasty!

the following match is a non tournament 6 Way cruiserweight match featuring chrisjen  hayme, hydra, Shawn reed, Chris styles,  Tim donist, and amasis.

up next is a pits of Hell match featuring deranged vs freak show. This is a slow match that ends with deranged breaking his ankle after botching  a move and sliping on a concrete floor drenched with rubbing alcohol and barbed wire. Extremely painful!

the next semi final match is Scotty vortex vs Viking in a log cabin light tube match.this is what I would call an average match until the end where Scotty vortex gets stabbed in the hand with a light tube and is still declared winner of the match.

the last semi final match is Danny havoc vs insane lane in a razor board match. This is a great match with an awesome performance by Danny havoc. I must say I did enjoy this match from start to finish.

the last match is a four way unlimited light tube match. Featuring freak show, Danny havoc, sexxxy  Eddy,  and scottie  vortex. I would much rather call this match a three way instead of a four way because scottie  vortex immediately disqualifies himself in the beginning of the match due to the injury he substained  to his hand in the semifinals. But even without four competitors in the match it's still an awesome match packed with lots of action, good spots, and a great conclusion to the tournament.

All in all this is a great DVD, I only bought it for a couple of dollars and the value is definitely there. I would say its a must have for any deathmatch or hardcore wrestling fan. I thoroughly enjoyed the great performances by young wrestlers like Danny havoc, Drake younger, Sexxxy  Eddy, etc....",1424649600,,3203,4.5834797891036905
8288572,1,B001CQ5PDI,"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor).  I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback.  I can't rate a DVD I have never seen.  I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it.  In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from.  I thought they were a good company.  I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense.  I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection.  I guess I will be more careful in the future.",1240012800,,641,4.154471544715447
