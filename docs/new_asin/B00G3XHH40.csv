6056657,3,B00G3XHH40,It's a slow start but toward the end really good. Good plot and there's action. The main character was a good fit for the part.,1400803200,,127,4.12
6056658,1,B00G3XHH40,"I look back in my catalog of movies that I found to be awful and honestly have to say, that at this time- this is the worse movie I have ever seen.

Why?

Incredibly bad acting. LIKE WORSE ACTING EVER( NOT EXAGGERATING HERE!)

Unlikeable and unattractive characters .

Cinematography pathetic.

Poor plot( there was a plot- right? I think?)

We all agreed it looked like some teenagers decided to practice making a movie for the first time- and this was the end result.

We cannot get our money back on this piece of garbage presenting itself as a movie; but even if this was free- I would be merciful and tell anyone interested in watching it, to save themselves from the torture of viewing this movie and pass it up.

6056660,1,B00G3XHH40,"It started out funny and I had some hope that it would at least be enjoyable, but those dreams quickly evaporated and I was left with a film that was just plain bad. The acting was remarkably terrible, the music was crappy, and the movie as a whole is not even worth a glance. The video and audio qualities are the best part of the DVD, and even the extras are OK. But don't waste your time on this worse-than-amateur production. Go outside and kick up some dirt instead; it'll save you time and you'll entertain yourself just as much.",1393459200,2,535,4.36

6056663,1,B00G3XHH40,"This movie was so bad; I don't really know where to start.  The only reason I watched it to the end was because I paid for it.  The worst acting ever. Plot was really non-existent.  I can't think of even one thing about this movie that was good.  I guess I could say that the horses were likely the finest actors in this movie.  This wouldn't even qualify as a ""B"" movie.  Sound effects were horrible.  I swear I could have filmed, acted and directed this movie in my backyard with an IPhone.  I should have went to that place with the dollar menu and bought four hamburgers and called it a day.  The burgers would have been less harmful to my health and wellbeing than this movie.  It is an absolute sin to call this thing a western and an utter insult to the worst western you have ever seen.  I am still pondering whether I watched a movie or a spoof of a movie.  Within five minutes into this mess, you know you are in for a waste of 4 bucks and about two hours of your life you will never get back.",1390694400,10,1003,4.087179487179487
6056664,5,B00G3XHH40,"With most studios ignoring the demands of the average American, its good to see Lionsgate is one of the few companies that is continuing the tradition of quality western films. Living By The Gun hits the marks that most traditional western fans will love. The Guns are blazing and there's a hard story of revenge at play that leaves a wake of death in the old west that I haven't seen since the ending of Open Range. The dialogue is on point and reflective of the period and its got the big town, saloon, brothels, and all that good stuff that western fans love to see on the screen. Keep em coming Lionsgate!!!",1390521600,3,611,4.415929203539823
6056665,4,B00G3XHH40,"This film tells the parallel stories of an uncle and his niece on separate but equal killing sprees fueled by family betrayals. They inevitably work their way toward each other. My only criticism is that the language was a bit too PG for the depth of the characters' rage. Also, some characters were too physically clean (clothes, skin) to be totally realistic for the time and place. In other words, would have liked the characters to be a bit grittier.  However, the beautiful photography of the landscape adds a lot to the mood of the film, contrasting the external serenity of the place with the internal chaos of the characters. Really liked the opening shots of the shooter loading his gun. Set the tone, and made the viewer feel close to the action.",1389916800,5,756,4.684210526315789

I could just picture the film crew (and possibly the actors) dragging away the old props and other junk that had been accumulating there over the years.  Ive seen better acting in porn...MUCH better.  Deserves a negative star.  If the director ever makes another film I can only hope its shot on a Back To The Future set.
