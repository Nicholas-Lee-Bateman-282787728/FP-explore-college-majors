8391003,5,B00383XYN6,"This I had found on Netflix a while ago, and after learning the setting for the ongoing series, based after an economoc collapse, nuclear holy war, and an alien invasion, I was hooked. The illustrated film style of this movie made it come alive with minimal animation, and it felt as though you were in a fully realized graphic novel (that this is based off of, and is currently ongoing) with how the style of art and animation was. An excellent watch for anyone who loves dark and gritty.",1422662400,,489,4.50561797752809
8391004,5,B00383XYN6,"Dark & gritty, it is a fantastic piece of comic animation. If you liked Heavy Metal (comics or movies) you will love this.",1399680000,,122,4.3478260869565215
8391005,4,B00383XYN6,"Godkiller definitely isn't targeting any mainstream audience.  What it does do, however, is create a vivid post-apocalyptic world with an animation style of its own.  I happen to love effective minimalism and Godkillers does that extraordinarily well.  The story itself is so gritty and the sound design and acting are so well done that you quickly get over that fact that this is more of an futuristic slideshow than a full on animated film.  This is a great peace of work with a vivid illustration style that will keep your attention.  The sex and violence aren't for the faint of heart (or anyone under 18) but it's definitely worth the watch.",1309478400,2,646,4.783783783783784
8391006,4,B00383XYN6,"Be aware that the title Godkiller: Walk Among Us [Complete Film DVD] is a little deceptive as at the end of the movie it displays rather boldly ""TO BE CONTINUED"". Since the storyline seems to be incomplete I'm left with one of two conclusions: 1) there will be another DVD following this one or 2) the storyline ends as shown (I can't go into more detail without a spoiler).
That aside I found the story quite compelling, dark, with a solid mature rating. Animation is sparse and in places look more like doodles than finished product.
If you've ever listened to 'book on tape', its a lot like that except you sit in front of the TV. So to sum up I am a little miffed at the packaging, it seems deceptive to me. I am satisfied with the creative product, not overwhelmed or thrilled, but a prior viewing was good enough for me to seek what I thought was the rest of the story.",1286582400,4,875,4.3090909090909095
8391007,5,B00383XYN6,"Not an in-depth review, let's just get to the point GODKILLER is amazing! Excellent voice casting, super dramatic art and a super dark story. It makes me fear for the future!!",1283817600,2,175,4.67741935483871
8391008,5,B00383XYN6,"This was an unbelievable experience.
From the second it starts I am just in awe of the visuals.
The writing feels genuine and characters so believable for a sci fi graphic novel.
If I had to criticize something, some of the voice work was a tad uninspired, but over all I would recommend this over and over again.
This makes me think that I haven't seen it all.",1283472000,2,361,4.323529411764706
8391009,5,B00383XYN6,"unlike other reviewers i didn't pick up this title to get an uplifting message or to teach me a lesson on good manners, but i did pick it up hoping for 90 minutes worth of kick-butt entertainment and i was more than satisfied.
the visuals are compelling, the ink drawings are beautiful and the narrative form is interesting and fresh.
If you're looking for an action-packed and intriguing immersion into another reality, then this is for you. I would compare it with similar films to get you acquainted with the style, but this film is so unique it's hard to think of something similar --at least in moving pictures.
if you're looking for a neatly packed moral tale with tips on good manners, then i would suggest Disney's recent release of ""The Princess and The Frog"".",1283472000,7,769,4.661764705882353
