6130053,4,B00H3N3V6C,Interesting movie about a teacher - student affair that turns bitter and can't be kept a secret very long...When the affair is uncovered  ...all hell breaks loose ...!!!,1404864000,2,169,5.035714285714286
6130054,5,B00H3N3V6C,"When a high school senior, Jamie Hall(Kelcie Stranahan)discovers her persuasive lovestruck teacher, Molly Matson(Josie Davis) is seducing her boyfriend, Danny Campbell(Cameron Deane Stewart)who ends up falling for Molly when Danny starts feeling sexually deprived in his troubled relationship with Jamie, events turn deadly after the teacher tries to cover it up by altering grades & planting incriminating evidence causing Molly to only go from bad to worse, especially when Molly falls for Danny like a bitch in heat.",1394150400,,519,5.666666666666667
6130055,2,B00H3N3V6C,"Ms. Matson, an attractive new high school teacher (unconvincingly played by Josie Davis) who suffered a very traumatic childhood, develops an instant crush on Danny, an 18-year-old Senior with affluent parents. She immediately begins seeing Danny after school, texting him, asking him out to dinner, and then over to her house. Jamie, Danny's smart, pretty, and responsible girlfriend, soon catches on, and a really ugly situation unfolds. A few other little subplots and complications.

The title and cover should tell you a great deal about what to expect from DIRTY TEACHER, with the exception that it's not that ""dirty"" in the way that many might hope: some implied sex, a few cleavage close-ups, etc. It's all very contrived, with many BIG improbabilities. The pervasive soundtrack (monotonously ominous synthesizer and piano scores during all the tenser moments) doesn't help much either.

Still, there's definitely an audience for this sort of so-stupid-it's-funny entertainment, including yours truly when he's in the right (or wrong) mood. I have to admit that DIRTY TEACHER kept me watching and did not turn out to be 100% predictable. Finally, at least some of the acting by those who play the teenagers, parents, and cops would have been decent if the script and directions weren't so lame.",1393545600,8,1302,5.22488038277512

6130057,1,B00H3N3V6C,"Jamie Hall's ( Kelcie Stranahan) world is coming to an end. Her boyfriend Danny (Cameron Deane Stewart) wants sex, but she is not ready. Her parents live in an upscale community, but she doesn't have a cell phone because dad got laid off.

Mom (Darlene Vogel) works two jobs and they had to rob Jamie's college fund to keep up the house payments. Danny's dad (Brett Stimely) was the one who laid off her dad (Marc Raducci). To top it all off, the new psycho teacher (Josie Davis) has the hots for her boyfriend, and is giving Jamie failing grades who now needs a scholarship.

The film was boring. Josie Davis who reminds me of Linda Carter was the highlight of the film. You know where the film is going. The expected dramatic and action scenes are watered down.

The flashbacks were pretty much a joke as it gave you a brief picture, but no story that made sense.

This reminded me of a bad Lifetime film with adult language. Not worth a Redbox rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity.",1386374400,,1001,4.478021978021978

6130102,1,B00H3N3V6C,"Yes, even by the low standards of Lifetime's formulaic, crime dramas, this one is bad. Horrible Fatal Attraction rip-off (and there have been many of those) with no surprises, high school drama club-level acting and a terrible script. Don't let the title fool you--this is tame, TV-14 (I would have rated it PG) level stuff. In fact, it plays like one of those old, Afterschool Movies (don't have sex with your teacher, kids!) with just a bit of racy/violent stuff thrown in.

6130105,3,B00H3N3V6C,"Rather formulaic thriller about a serious subject -- teacher abuse of high school students.  The plot seems over the top and far-fetched, yet the film is captivating anyway.  Maybe this has happened somewhere.  If so, a horrible crime.",1462233600,2,235,5.131578947368421
6130106,1,B00H3N3V6C,"This is another one of those Lifetime ""forbidden"" and ""dark"" romance movies. It circles around a teenage girl, a Straight A student, with a boyfriend living in California (ALL these Lifetime teen-drama movies are set in CA, from what I've seen). He's on the baseball team and the girl isn't ready for a sexual relationship. So he finds his opportunity when a new, good-looking"" teacher takes over their class.
  I personally, a guy, did not find her attractive. Her character had an oily face, weird plastic-surgery looking lips, and a scrawny body.
  Anyway, she has mental problems and gets spurts of psychiatric episodes, where she sees her foster mother calling her ""ugly"". As a result, as a child she kills her mother with a syringe, and the mother repeatedly yells throughout the movie's flashbacks, ""WHAT DID YOU DO??!!!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???!!!!!!!!!!!??"" Overall, it's annoying.
  So the boy, not getting any physical stuff from his girlfriend, falls for the new teacher. She invites him over to her house where they begin a descreet sexual relationship. The teacher acts super dependent on other people for self-esteem boosts, compliments, and beings to act clingy to the boy. Overall she's an annoying pest throughout the film.
  She flunks the boy's girlfriend on purpose, possibly out of jealousy or retribution. After the boy snaps out of the sexual spell his teacher lulled him into, he ends it with her at an empty parking lot one night. It was WAY too much for the teacher to handle, so she dramatically and spitefully runs him over with her SUV, killing him.
  She then rubs the blood off her bumper and places it on the girl's, hoping to frame her. She also goes to the movies so she'll have a ticket all ready whenever the police interview her. She's highly manipulative, has sociopathic traits, and is basically a dark entity of a person.

Long story short: the evidence eventually becomes tied to the teacher, and she gets sent to prison instead of the girl. The girl makes it into the university that she had always aimed to go to at the end of the movie.

Very clich and unbelievable. This movie is overall every teenage boy's fantasy, but it didn't bring anything new to Lifetime.",1461456000,,2207,4.809523809523809
