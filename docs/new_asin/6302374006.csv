7825222,5,6302374006,Such a great performance by Lou Reed and John Cale- a moving tribute to Andy Warhol.,1458864000,,84,4.3125
7825223,4,6302374006,I had the album but cant seem to get ahold of this video. I would love to see CALE & REED together. However i know warhol was a mind-twisted freak of the highest order & therefore unworthy of any kind of memorial or tribute.,1420070400,,224,4.113636363636363
7825224,5,6302374006,Together they made contemporary music history. They wrote material that was years ahead of it's time. Once Cale left VU - the band would never recover and eventually all the wheels fell off. Together again for Andy they wrote classic VU material and performed it with the same VU vibe that was captured on this tape. This is a must have for Velvet Underground fans.,1394668800,,365,4.630769230769231
