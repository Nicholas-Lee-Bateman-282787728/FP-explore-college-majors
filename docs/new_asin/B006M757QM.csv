5004136,5,B006M757QM,Great video.  No flaws noted so far and it's like going back in time!  Grouch had a unique comedy all his own.  There are several interesting famous people included on his shows almost forgotten with the years.  A very good purchase and I recommend it if you enjoy the comedy of that time era.,1429747200,3,293,4.37037037037037

5004138,1,B006M757QM,"Ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  Arrived with the DVD rattling around in the case, opened it and found the hub broken and the insides smelled very very strongly of moth balls - really awful.  Never had a chance to watch it so can't comment on the quality or content of the DVD itself.",1419120000,,295,4.345454545454546
5004139,5,B006M757QM,"Possibly the best money I've spent in a long time and it was very little money at that.  I have tremendously enjoyed this DVD,  watching Groucho interact and joke with his contestants.  Speaking of contestants, I was utterly surprised to see a few stars show up on his show, notably that wonderful comedienne, Phyllis Diller who was just starting out in show business.  Does the smile show on my face right now?
I've watched eight of the fourteen shows on the DVD and will finish up tomorrow, but right after I finish writing this, I'm going to look to see if there are any additional DVD's available of ""You Bet Your Life"".  I remember watching Groucho years ago and wondered if I would find this DVD boring, thinking I may have overestimated its entertainment value, but I've been smiling and having a good laugh with each episode.
I am truly glad I purchased this DVD.",1408924800,3,871,4.593548387096774
5004140,5,B006M757QM,"I have most of the shows on DVD. It is too bad that this generation will never fully  appreciate or understand the wit, humor, and creativity of Groucho. This series is a must for everyone; tis was TV in the 50's and it will never be the same.
High recommend the You Bet You Life DVD's.",1387929600,,286,4.107142857142857
