2242154,5,B0007TKNBK,"This DVD is so much fun. It stars the beloved Sesame Street character including the Count, of course. But beyond just counting, the video is fun. Funny jokes, music and colors...It's a lof of fun and my kid loves it. Parents: you children will learn their number with this DVD before they even realize they are learning and not just watching some video.",1129334400,12,353,4.619047619047619
2242155,5,B0007TKNBK,"As a 20-something looking for a little nostalgia, this video brings back my Sesame Street memories from the 80s. I originally had it on video, and was delighted to see it was later released on DVD. A must have for any adult Sesame Street collector/fan!",1128902400,7,252,4.622222222222222
2242186,5,B0007TKNBK,"My daughters love this video, and to be honest it's one of the only children videos that I can stomach.  The video will appeal to adults as well as children.  My favorite is the song called ""ZZ Blues"" and I swear the puppets look and sound just like ZZ Top.  It's a cute video.",1461888000,2,277,4.092592592592593
2242187,5,B0007TKNBK,"I used to watch this movie when I was little, but as time passed by the VHS stopped working, so I decided to buy this DVD.

2242217,2,B0007TKNBK,"When my son was younger, The Count was his favorite Sesame Street character. This video was very disappointing and we got rid of it after only a couple of weeks.",1398211200,,161,4.4
2242218,5,B0007TKNBK,"Well, It's called ""Count it Higher: Great Music Videos From Sesame Street"", that's the title of the 1986 release. Yes, this release doesn't imply anything of music, but take the time to read the box to understand that it's not about counting. It's about a music countdown of Sesame Songs.

It implies music over actually counting.

Please, read the box.",1387238400,2,353,4.866666666666666
2242219,5,B0007TKNBK,"My toddler goes on kicks--in other words, we watch the same video over and over and over and over and...well, you get the point.  This video has catchy songs (some overtly educational, some just fun) that I still like after the 10,000th viewing.",1382313600,,245,4.6976744186046515
2242220,4,B0007TKNBK,We are enjoying this video. Full of great fun songs. Adds math to the songs in a great fun way.,1381708800,2,95,3.8

my grandson watches it over and over he is realy hooked on the sesame street media!!!",1370390400,2,111,4.6
2242222,5,B0007TKNBK,I loved watching this with  my kids.  Now i'm on to sharing it with my grandson! It will be good times together!,1366588800,,112,4.045454545454546
2242223,5,B0007TKNBK,"I bought this for my granddaughter who is 3 years old.  She watches it in the car, she sings along with the music.  She can now count to 15 and recognize numbers 1 thru 10. I would highly recommend this DVD for your little ones.",1363824000,,228,4.044444444444444
2242224,5,B0007TKNBK,I believe I enjoy this video just as much as the grandchildren.  When I want them to settle down this video can do it and they love to sing along.,1362096000,,146,3.8666666666666667
2242225,5,B0007TKNBK,"I watched this a lot with my younger sisters and had to buy it for my own child, and of course he loves it!",1360713600,,107,3.5
2242246,5,B0007TKNBK,"As other people have commented, this video is not just about counting. I find that to be a plus. Different songs teach children about hygiene, letters, and numbers. The songs are very catchy, but not annoyingly so. It's a video that won't drive parents crazy either.",1355702400,5,266,4.804347826086956
2242247,5,B0007TKNBK,My 2 1/2 grandson loves it.  I had to buy an extra one so he could take it home.  The various characters made viewing fun for everyone.,1331424000,,135,3.962962962962963
2242248,5,B0007TKNBK,"We don't have a television in our household, but we allow our 2 year-old daughter to watch a few, select videos. When I babysat two young boys (more than 15 years ago), I found this video so entertaining that I made a mental note to track down a copy when I had kids in the future. When I revisited the video in the last year, I was not disappointed. Each of the songs is driven by witty word play and is either inspired by a specific rock tune or a general style of popular music. From the ""Beetles"" ""Letter B"" to Ernie's reggae ""Do De Rubber Duck,"" the songs are a lot of fun. I haven't been equally impressed with the other Sesame Street videos we've purchased, but this one is definitely a keeper.",1286150400,,701,4.2388059701492535
2242249,3,B0007TKNBK,"We aren't crazy about this dvd.  I thought the songs would be about counting, but it's only a countdown of songs.  Most of the songs are slow and not upbeat with not much action (like doctors singing about hygiene).  It's very dated looking.  My toddler usually wanders off when this is on.  She likes Kids Favorite Songs with Elmo much better.",1276992000,2,344,4.573770491803279
2242250,5,B0007TKNBK,"My two-year-old and I think this is the greatest! He's enjoyed some other Sesame Street videos, but after a while he's invariably gotten bored with them--not this one. I think it's because it's more music and less talk. We especially love the honkers, and ""de rubber duck"", and Count it Higher has become the first tv performance to get my son to jump off as much energy at home as he does when he gets to play outside, so it's been great for rainy days. I also like that it's only half an hour long--I don't like sitting my boy in front of the tv for long periods of time, and he's never impressed when I try to cut some of the hour-long programs short. Though I do confess that when we watch this one we often watch some parts again when we're done.

We took this along with us recently to a small dinner party so we'd have something to entertain and distract our boy with. It ended up being the big hit of the evening for the adults. They kept gravitating towards it, talking about which songs they liked the best and how much they loved Sesame Street.",1259625600,,1055,4.275
2242251,5,B0007TKNBK,This video came very quick and my son loves it sooo much!! We watch at least 3 times a week!! Not to mention the price was phenomenal!!,1238544000,,135,4.037037037037037
2242252,1,B0007TKNBK,I bought this product as an interactive tool to help my son counting numbers.  The video was about count down video-musical hits from Sesame Street.  My six year old and me agree giving it two thumbs down.,1197504000,4,205,4.513513513513513
2242253,3,B0007TKNBK,a mixed collection of songs supposed to be countdown but does not start from 10!,1192752000,,80,4.4
2242254,4,B0007TKNBK,"Well, based on the title of this DVD I thought it would actually be about counting and numbers.  I was looking for something to help my 2 year old with his counting.
It's actually a ""COUNT DOWN"" of Sesame Street music videos hosted by The Count.
In all honesty, it's a good DVD.  Entertaining enough for my little ones.  My son and daughter and even the baby all dance and jump up and down from beginning to end to the music on the DVD.
The only real counting is in the last song called, ""Count it Higher"" which is very fun, lively, and upbeat...but it doesn't really in my opinion, help teach counting very well.
I guess if you're looking for a fun video that will get your kids dancing, this is a good choice.",1185753600,27,711,4.2518518518518515
2242255,3,B0007TKNBK,"The Count is my 3 year old son's favorite character on Sesame Street and I was hoping to get a dvd with more of him in it.  He was the host, but there were not any of his skits in it :-(",1142121600,21,186,3.4285714285714284
8051516,5,B0007TKNBK,A blast from the past and on DVD!  Fun to sing along with.  My son remembers this from his childhood. Now he gets to share this G rated memory with his child.,1521158400,,158,3.90625

8051518,2,B0007TKNBK,I was looking for a newer version of the count because thats what my daughter watches now. This is just not what i was expecting.,1505865600,,129,4.2
8051519,5,B0007TKNBK,"My 1.5-2 yr old LOVES the Count and it can be a little difficult to find Sesame Street items that focus on him since everything is really Elmo focused these days. This DVD uses The Count as the host of a video countdown show as the framing device so she gets lots of time with her favorite muppet. The videos included aren't the numbers focused educational ones, they're music video ones,so they're good for dancing time.",1504137600,,421,4.552631578947368

I recommend it as a gift for your child for birthday or Christmas. The song that your child will love on this DVD is ""Do Op Hop"" by Kermit the Frog. It's a song I danced to as a little boy. I've been sharing this DVD with the young 2nd cousins in my family. Your child will love this Sesame Street DVD also.",1473897600,,430,4.011627906976744
