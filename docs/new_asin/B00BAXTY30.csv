5567459,5,B00BAXTY30,"The impressive part is the writing, a lot of good dialog, a minimum of violence, many episodes written by Roddenberry. Still fun after all these years.",1369353600,,151,4.846153846153846
5567460,5,B00BAXTY30,"This is still my ideal man,strong and sensitive with a code of honor and a great sense of humor!  And ""Have Gun Will Travel""  is one of the few series that usually taught a lesson about human values!",1369180800,2,199,4.2105263157894735
5567461,5,B00BAXTY30,"HGWT is another of my favorites from my childhood. I used to watch it on Saturday night, along with Gunsmoke, with my mom and dad.

The picture is top-notch and the sound is very good. Some of the episodes are a cut belong the earlier years as I've read the Richard Boone was getting tired of the show. I'm so GLAD that the movie version with Eminem that was to update the story to a bounty hunter in modern day Detroit was finally dropped - that would have been a disaster of the first order!!

But anyway, even thro the series had dropped off a little it is still very fun to watch today.",1368403200,10,590,4.166666666666667
5567462,4,B00BAXTY30,"If you log onto Internet Movie Database, you'll see Season 6 contained ""34"" episodes, but only 32 are appear in this two volume season set.  Huh?

Here's the breakdown:  ""Sanctuary"" originally aired December 31, 1960.  So it's included in Season 4, Volume 1. ""Squatter's Rights"" originally aired December 30, 1961, and is included in Season 5, Volume 1.
Under Season 6, Internet Movie Database lists ""Sanctuary"" as having aired on June 22, 1963, and ""Squatter's Rights"" as having aired on August 3rd of '63; several months after the final new episode of the series aired.  Therefore, IMDB lists season 6 as having 34 episodes, not the 32 included in Vol. 2 DVD set.

Since the two episodes in question were summer repeats, there was no need to place them on the season 6 set.  Hope this clears up the confusion.

4 stars are for weak scripts and Paramount's continued greediness in its multi-volume pricing of TV show season sets.",1367971200,23,930,4.80503144654088
5567463,3,B00BAXTY30,"Season 6 of the TV series Have Gun Will Travel consisted of 34 episodes.  The two-volume release of season 6 on dvd contains only the first 32 episodes. Missing are ""The Sanctuary"" and ""Squatter's Rights"".  Not good.",1367971200,7,216,4.8108108108108105
5567464,5,B00BAXTY30,"Love the series, love Richard Boone - glad the dvd's are finally coming out for the final season - seems like forever !!

Wish it was just one set, but I will take what I can get!",1364083200,7,179,3.8378378378378377

5567466,5,B00BAXTY30,Would recommend to any TV western fan.,1471132800,,38,4.571428571428571
5567467,4,B00BAXTY30,"Have Gun-Will Travel was among the first of TV's adult westerns.  During its six year run, the series featured many starting actors who would go on to greater fame, as well as familiar faces whose ""big star"" years might have been behind them.  Equally important, the names of several writers and directors were -- or would become -- familiar: Ida Lupino, Gene Roddenberry, to name but two. The episodes were, in effect, 30-minute morality plays, but told with an attempt to underline the moral dilemma.  Little of the flashy -- and often gratuitous -- blood-letting of current programming.  In my opinion: great stories, well-acted, well-told.",1468540800,,643,5.095238095238095
5567468,5,B00BAXTY30,good,1462665600,,4,4.0
5567469,5,B00BAXTY30,I love it. New to me as the series ran before my time...but a favorite of my late husband. I tried it out because he spoke so often about it and it piqued my curiosity. I don't regret a single purchase...and I eventually got the whole set too! It's a great western and Richard Boone plays the part well. I'll be watching this often in the years to come. It beats almost everything on TV today.,1451520000,,393,4.184210526315789
5567470,5,B00BAXTY30,I remember watching this with my dad.  Real values on display,1447372800,,61,4.545454545454546

5567475,5,B00BAXTY30,One of the best shows ever on TV!,1435017600,,33,3.25
5567476,5,B00BAXTY30,I love this show and have bought the entire series on DVD (6 seasons total). Richard Boone is a great actor and his laugh is infectious. This isn't the typical western which makes it a fun and entertaining show. I grew up watching Gunsmoke reruns with my dad but didn't discover HGWT till about 10 years ago when I caught a few episodes on the Westerns Channel. I was hooked and started buying the seasons on DVD. As far as the DVDs and content goes - The first 3 seasons were done really well. They include guest star bios and interesting facts for each episode. The last 3 seasons were released later and do not include this bonus information which is a shame. (though I am thankful they DID finally release them!) They also divided the last 3 seasons up into two volumes each in order to make more money. The video quality of the second 3 seasons also seems to be of lesser quality (maybe the first 3 seasons were digitally cleaned up and the last three were not?). In my humble opinion seasons 1-4 are rock solid with great episodes and story lines. Seasons 5 & 6 (in my opinion) the quality of story lines and acting seems to drop in a noticeable way. Still worth watching of course but just something that I noticed. Overall a great TV series with a great actor. Thankful they are available on DVD so I can watch them with my boys.,1432684800,2,1337,4.352

5567480,3,B00BAXTY30,"The series' worst season. (Still better than today's tripe, of course.) Sadly, Boone got tired of the role and wanted to ""experiment"" instead of just making westerns.",1418601600,,166,5.185185185185185
5567481,5,B00BAXTY30,"If any of these people that read this were fans of Clint Eastwood and Richard Boone they should enjoy all of them.
Season 8 on Rawhide misses Gil Favor but Clint takes up the slack.  Regards a well pleased customer.",1414540800,,215,4.375

5567486,5,B00BAXTY30,Have Gun Will Travel Season 6 is a Western that will be in my collection for years to come and is the best. Richard Boone is a STAR that will shine. I will miss his shineing STAR. REMAIN BLESS,1398556800,,192,3.948717948717949
5567487,5,B00BAXTY30,"There were only 6 seasons of this wonderful show.  I wish Boone had done at least 6 more.  Paladin is such a wonderful, complex character.  I have seen all 225 episodes and could watch them again and again.  He was fascinating to watch.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to watch a quality show.",1396656000,,313,4.421052631578948
5567488,5,B00BAXTY30,"Richard Boone is at his best staring as the show's main character, Paladin, a gunman for hire.  However, it is not a bad guy, or is he? This is a great show from TV's age of Westerns.",1391212800,,183,3.945945945945946
5567489,5,B00BAXTY30,I have all the DVD's. Best western of all time on TV. Richard Boone does a great job as Paladin.,1390953600,,96,3.85

5567492,4,B00BAXTY30,Love the episodes and have ordered all of the series.  I am ticked that they split the season in two so they could hit you up for two purchases.,1387324800,,144,3.9655172413793105
5567493,5,B00BAXTY30,"The show ran for 225 episodes from 1957 to 1963, with Boone receiving two more Emmy nominations, in 1959 and 1960.
Miss the little factoids that were included with each episode real screw-up to stop including those.",1380067200,,215,4.837837837837838

5567498,5,B00BAXTY30,This series embodies the great writing we used to see in TV drama. It was not afraid to address the problems of the day in a subtle way. Certainly remains meaningful.,1378080000,2,166,4.387096774193548

5567504,5,B00BAXTY30,"This series kept its quality right up to the end. Although the first three seasons are probably the best, there are outstanding episodes in both volumes one and two of the sixth and final season of ""Have Gun Will Travel"". The product quality is terrific too as the picture is crisp and the DVD reveals details that would be undetected on video tape. Complete your set today. My grandmother loved this series when I was a boy and I love it now. Sure wish I could watch it with her.",1374537600,5,480,4.344444444444444
5567505,5,B00BAXTY30,I love this old western tv show about a gunfighter that goes all over to help others fight for whar is right but tries to solve the problem without gun play when possible but can't always do it. I would recommend this show for all.,1374278400,,231,4.155555555555556

5567507,5,B00BAXTY30,Just a great TV western from the 1950's!  I recommend this show to all who loves the old TV cowboy shows.  It is the best western from the 50's.,1372032000,,144,3.9310344827586206
5567508,5,B00BAXTY30,Richard Boone continued to give memorable performances in the  series.  His reaction to new and trying situations is still unpredictable or very predictable deoending on your vioew point..,1372032000,,188,5.678571428571429
5567509,5,B00BAXTY30,"First class transfer of this classic Western. Not only is the picture sharp, but the sound is excellent. If you are a fan of Richard Boone and Paladin, get it while the going is good.",1371513600,2,183,4.257142857142857
5567510,1,B00BAXTY30,"It's not the caliber of the dvd but rather the show itself-what a dissapointment. Lackluster writing, no imagination. The hotel and Kam Tong's 'Hey Boy' character hardly appear and al we have left is yet another cowboy on the trail, cowboy solves everything with a fight story. The first year gave something interesting but the show' s producers and writers added nothing and never explored all possibilties including Paladin traveling to exotic places. very dissappointed.",1371254400,2,473,5.32
5567511,5,B00BAXTY30,I like Westerns and Have Gun Will Travel is one of the best! I used to watch it when I was growing up. I never tire of Richard Boone and the spots he manages to get in and out of. It's Black & White but well shot with good picture detail.,1371081600,3,238,3.6862745098039214
5567512,5,B00BAXTY30,I now own the entire series and am just about through with season 4.  If you love westerns this is a wonderful way to pass the time and the story lines are always about what is decent and fair.,1370736000,2,193,3.948717948717949

8565036,5,B00BAXTY30,"Interesting ""Genesis"" episode to begin the last year.  The origin of Paladin's name and occupation is explained.  Ironically, Paladin kills his role model by the use of smoke.  After killing the grey-haired gunfighter named ""Smoke,"" Paladin adopts his black clothes, uses his black holster with the knight emblem, and becomes, like Smoke, a crusader for those who need his help.  Aside from the DVD, even more ironic, Richard Boone in real life dies from throat cancer induced by smoking.  Hard to beat the ""Genesis"" episode for irony overall.",1492992000,,543,5.125
8565037,3,B00BAXTY30,"Not the same show as the first 3 seasons.
In the first three seasons paladin didn't take schit from anyone but by the sixth season paladin is getting tricked/lied into taking jobs he doesn't want by little runts.
  He routinely gets his guns taken away from him by third rate gun fighters and he takes most jobs for free.
Hell in some episodes he doesn't shoot one bullet.  Seems like he turned into a liberal.
But my question is how does he still live his lifestyle when he isn't being paid.
But I still rate it three stars..average...",1490918400,,536,4.448979591836735
