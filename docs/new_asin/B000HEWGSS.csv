8139315,4,B000HEWGSS,"Clearly a film for the male fantasy. There is a group of ""mean girls"" known as the ""Disciplinary Group"" who bully the other girls at what is the Japanese equivalent of a reform school. They have the blessings of the vice principle. A girl dies and shorty there after three new girls show up at school who themselves are gang leaders. We later discover, as does one of the girls, that she knew the girl who died. This degrades into a plot holed revenge film.

For the guys...and a few of you gals there is plenty of nudity, a cat fight, tied up topless torture, shower/bath scene which includes a ""sex check"", girl/girl action/ principle raped by four girls....at first/brief rape scene/ Japanese vibrator soft core. I think you get the idea not to look for a deeper meaning.

The respectful singing send off to the principle who was disgraced had me laughing.

8139316,1,B000HEWGSS,"I am a film lover..you don't have to win or be nominated for anything for me to like it, but this film ( I use that word sparingly) is simply bad.  There is no story line really to speak of..it's more like 70's softcore with poorly edited together scenes of school girl rape.  Not interesting, not entertaining, and I feel that they are just throwing these films out under Pinky Violence because it sells.  I wish I hadn't been sold.  RICO, SEX and FURY, HANZO, LADY SNOW BOOOD, FEMALE YAKUZA TALE, now those are worth your while..not this hot mess.",1235952000,,549,4.46
8139317,4,B000HEWGSS,"Truly a guilty pleasure! Bad school girls engaging in depraved behaviour, all to the humilation of self-righteous, hypocritical school officials. What is there not to like about this 1973 film? The Special Features are a little sparse but I think it is a given that this film's historical artifacts were not intended for all time. This genre was produced for its time, it is up to us to cherish its unique qualities and lovely charms.",1191974400,,434,4.8
8139318,4,B000HEWGSS,"Terrifying Girls' High School Stars Miki Sugimoto and Reiko and directed by the guy who filmed Sex and Fury. This film is about a Japanese reform school for bad girls, and Miki and Reiko are sentenced there only to discover that the female students have killed one of their own and cover it up. There is a lot of nudity and sex but plenty of the strong graphic violence that the movie would have not been shown on Cinemax or Encore. In all of the top 20 classic Japanese bad girl movies, this would be ranked at No. 3.",1176940800,3,518,4.242424242424242
8139319,5,B000HEWGSS,"Brilliant film in the tradition of ""Reform School Girls"" but with the Japanese code of honor twist.  Definitely a different film and a different take on the role of women in society (consider: The Theory of Practice) and the importance of honor and the code of conduct as social contract.  Also a very heavy piss-take on the puffed up effrontery of the bureaucrat and the corrupt business man so prominent in modern countries.

It is also strange that when female nudity is the subject, pubic hair is like Kryptonite to the Japanese auteur.  Considering the scenes of rape, inappropriate adult-child/student intercourse, torture and murder, a few black curly hairs would have been a problem.  Very interesting.

This film is a hoot but very not for kids.  Definitely of a tradition with anime, though, for those who can handle it.",1166227200,6,830,4.928057553956834
8139320,4,B000HEWGSS,"Living up to the Pinky Violence moniker in ways you couldn't imagine, this film packs in more brutality before the opening credits than most films of this genre.  You can read (and probably have) read the plot synopsis before reading this reviews, and you may ask yourself: Is this as good as it sounds?  Yes.

Sure, there are moments that are hokey, and there are cultural differences (as to be expected in a 1970s Japanese film), but it is one of the best of the Pinky Violence series, and it wears its vileness proudly.  There's also a social message here, too, but don't think it detracts from the film's exploitation angles.  It doesn't.

This is a fine film overall.  It's a must-see for anyone interested in the genre.  It is not, hwoever, for the squeamish, as there is plenty of blood, violence and nudity -- and they're often combined.",1162080000,8,845,4.624161073825503
