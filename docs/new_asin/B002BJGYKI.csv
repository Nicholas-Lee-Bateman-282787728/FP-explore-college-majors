3894570,2,B002BJGYKI,"<strong>The Last Resort</strong> (Brandon Nutt, 2009)

There was a ""how-to-write"" book I read back when I was a teenager that spent a chapter talking about the idea of whether the nugget you had in your head claiming to be the next Great American Novel was even a novel. That was thirty years ago, and I'm horribly paraphrasing, but it gave you a sample nugget about a kid named Timmy Barnes (I think it was Timmy Barnes) foiling a robbery at a candy store, and then went on to say, ""is this a novel? A short story? A lie told by Timmy Barnes' demented mother?""

This movie is a lie told by Timmy Barnes' demented mother. Not only because of its brevity (it clocks in at just seventy-five minutes) but also because it's got all the hallmarks of a lie being whipped up by a drunk, slightly addled housewife sitting at her kitchen table at 10:30 in the morning talking to the guy who came by to read the gas meter. I mean, think about it. You've got five impossibly beautiful chicks in Mexico at a bachelorette party (at least one of whom is some sort of ninja master, we find out early on, when she rescues the painfully drunk bride-to-be from the clutches of a macho muscle man). One of the bridesmaids, Sophia (<em>Friday the 13th </em>'s America Olivo), hooks up with a beach bum/10th Grade English Teacher (I kid you not) named Rob (<em>Off Campus</em>' Nick Ballard), and is thus otherwise occupied when the other four, bride Kat (Marissa Tait, best known for a two-year stint on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em> at the turn of the century), and bridesmaids Amber (<em>Lure: Teen Fight Club</em>'s Paulie Rojas), Beth (<em>Drive Thru</em>'s Sita Young), and Jessica (Arianne Zucker, a <em>Days of Our Lives</em> staple since 1998), head out into the desert on a sightseeing trip with a couple of guys who intend to rob them and dump them in the desert. Which is exactly what they do. The four limp off (Kat was shot attempting to escape) to a nearby abandoned resort that all the locals stay away from, and with only a garbled, frantic phone call to help her, Sophia, with the help of Rob and his slacker friend Jeremy (<em>The Social Network</em>'s Jeremy Glazer), have to track them down before the unspeakable evil she was warned about by a random palm-reader destroys all their lives. Or something.

Its brevity, ironically, is one of the things that saves it from being as awful as it could have been; that said, it's an outline, a sketch for what it really could have been. Problem is, with the acting so bad, the direction so incompetent, and the script, which was written by a first-timer and two production assistants on <em>That 70s Show</em> (ah, suddenly so much more of this makes sense), so idiotic that fleshing out the story and trying to create characters whose names you might be able to remember would probably have just made it even worse than it is. There are a couple of scenes of frolicking cuties, and one very memorable death/discovery scene that would have been highly amusing transplanted into another (any other!) movie. If that's enough for you, by all means, grab this next time you're standing in front of your local redbox not sure what to kill time with. The rest of you, avoid it like the plague. * ",1307664000,2,3240,4.639372822299651
3894571,1,B002BJGYKI,"I love slasher movies, and I love movies with a twist but I hate carbon copy clones of themes with a slight twist so you don't think you are watching hostel. I hated Last Resort it was a stupid collage of better movies.  Friends go out for break, get kidnapped and tortured but wait therre is a twist, ghost.  The movie gets really stupid from there.  Friends go looking for lost frinds get the kidnappers to take them to the location where they left them, ghost makes everyone do crazy thing bla bla bla.  the only almost redeeming quality of this movie was America Olivo.  I love her she will make a great actress because she is so expressive physically and emotionally.  But note I said almost redeeming, don't waste your money on this movie...i fyou want to see america in all her evil emoting glory rent or buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neighbor-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B003KV3E2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neighbor (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>",1306627200,,1001,5.425806451612903
3894572,4,B002BJGYKI,"The cover is clearly misleading, but as they say ""dont judge a book, buy its cover"" I hd no expectations going into this and like Ive said in many of my reviews, thats the only way to enjoy films.

The movie is not terrible. A few girls go to Mexico in what we could call a ""bachelorette trip"" A few of the girls go on a ""tour"" and end up having to walk through a desert to find help. The come a cross a deserted place/building that looks like some kind of sex church and the girls slowly become possessed. That in my opinion is where the film went wrong. We are not explained why they became possessed. If you look back at the sex drawings on the wall one would think this would become a sex torture dungeon kinda film where they torture each girl,  I don't want to see that, but it probably would have made more sense, because there really is no connection between the church, the sex art and the girls becoming possessed Despite all that its not bad, the girls are beautiful. The acting isn't as bad as some people say. Trust me Ive seen worse (just read my reviews) Its worth watching once, but again watch it with zero expectations. I never read reviews first because it ruins your movie experience.",1300320000,,1204,4.299559471365638
3894573,2,B002BJGYKI,"Marissa Tait is my step daughter and her mother and I watched this movie together.  They had a lot of fun making it and it shows on the screen.  Not the finest horror movie ever, but we enjoyed watching Marissa on screen.",1291248000,,221,4.238095238095238

3894575,2,B002BJGYKI,"For best friends Sophia, Jessica, Beth, and Amber, one little night of drunk debauchery isn't enough for their bride-to-be friend Kathleen - no, they head off to Mexico for an entire week of bachelorette party fun.  As you might expect, their party time soon turns into a nightmare, as four of them (minus the one that hooked up with some guy the night before) are driven out into the desert, robbed by their ""tour guides,"" and abandoned in the middle of nowhere.  With one of their number shot, the girls hole up in an old abandoned resort and hope that their other friend will be able to find and rescue them.  They have no idea that their ""last resort"" is so tainted with evil that the locals refuse to go anywhere near the place.

It's not that easy to go wrong with a film built around attractive young women drinking and partying, but director Brandon Nutt and the three script writers manage to do just that.  Except for the one girl being separated from the group early on, the story plays out quite predictably all the way through the final frame.  We really don't see enough of what happens to the girls that night in the resort, either.  Yes, we know how the cursed resort affects them, but no one even bothers to explain how it happens.  We don't really get to know these characters very well, either - in fact, I had trouble remembering which girl was which at the end of the movie.  As far as the acting is concerned, though, I don't think it's all that bad given the film's estimated budget of $155,000 - it's at least competent, anyway.  It's pretty clear the filmmakers didn't invest in the most advanced video equipment, though.

The Last Resort probably appeals most to horror fans, but there's really not much here for a horror fan to enjoy.  The film entirely fails to register on even the most sensitive of fright scales, and there isn't the slightest hint of suspense to be found anywhere.  There is some gore, but it's of the bland ""look what happened here"" variety.  When you come right down to it, there's very little here for a horror fan to embrace, and - aside from the hotness of America Olivo - there's virtually nothing about The Last Resort that will appeal to the non-horror fan.",1286150400,,2213,4.513784461152882
3894576,2,B002BJGYKI,"Once upon a time 5 lovely girls went off to celebrate one's impending nuptials in Mexico when...oops been here done this.
Of course they meet a couple of hunky guys, get drunk and four of them are kidnapped, robbed and left to die in the desert.  But since we know from the beginning there's something evil in the nearby abandoned resort where else would the bimbos end up?
THE LAST RESORT offers little in originality and is quite poorly done.  The acting is awful and the ending completely contrived.

3894577,1,B002BJGYKI,I'm as mad as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!  This inept piece of ^%$& is ruining the horror film genre'.  More and more we are introduced to worthless films like this and we may get lucky and enjoy one-out-of-five now and then.  I'm glad I paid $1.99 for this and didn't spend twice that for a rental or 10 times that for a new copy.  Everyone involved in this film...from the director (it had one?) to the stars (it had some?) should get a real job.  This is definitely a last resort for horror fans.,1268006400,4,514,4.151515151515151
3894578,1,B002BJGYKI,"This movie is absolutely horrible...and that is saying a lot coming from me!!!  But the acting was atrocious and the plot was weak at best.  I understand that you are not looking for a great plot and top shelf acting in a horror movie, but the majority of horror movies have passable acting and at least a basically decent storyline.  Not the case here...

Bottom line...Do not rent, purchase or view this movie!!!  Not if all the other movies were gone and this was the last option...This warning warrants repetition...Under no circumstances should you watch this movie...not even if it is...THE LAST RESORT!!!",1257379200,15,611,4.893203883495145
3894579,1,B002BJGYKI,"This is about as bad as it gets, folks.

There is nothing in the line of horror, suspense, or plot that is offered up in this pile of trash...it is a complete waste of celluloid.

The acting, if you could call it that, makes Paris Hilton's acting look worthy of an Oscar. The dialogue is full of absurd, banal one-liners that try to be hip and funny, but they are not funny and the phrases have not been hip since about 1996. The directors and screenwriters clearly attempted to remake ""Wolf Creek"" and combine it with ""Turistas."" Their attempts to add humor into the mix falls flat.....and after watching it, one wonders why there is even a picture of a woman in a bikini on a beach gracing the cover art when the entire film takes place in the middle of a desert in Mexico.",1251331200,12,775,4.337931034482758

8361457,1,B002BJGYKI,"I had nothing else to do on a Wednesday night and attempted to watch this.  Lesson?  Never watch a movie directed by a Nutt.  I've seen a few B movies in my time.  This was an F movie.  Skipped right over C, D, and E.  what did it cost to make this one, $127.50?  That was just to feed the cast on the Monday they filmed it.  Oh, we'll . . .

8361459,2,B002BJGYKI,"I have the bad habit of giving just about any horror movie a chance for no other reason than I enjoy the genre. The worst films horror has to offer are usually still good for laughs, so I rarely consider my time wasted, and every once in awhile I discover a diamond in the rough. Unfortunately, Last Resort it the latter, not the former.

While the plot is standard fare (hotties drink copiously in Mexico, get mixed up with some rough folk, and end up stranded at a haunted Hell House-esque resort in the middle of the desert) and clichs are common (a creepy old woman predicts the hotties' demise; the two main male characters are lust-driven idiots), the acting was much better than I expected and the script wasn't half bad. Last Resort is also more visually appealing than a lot of B-movies. In short, the camerawork is a slight step above what I have come to expect from low-budget horror flicks, a pleasant surprise.

At the same time, Last Resort still contains quite a heavy dose of cheese. Some of the dialogue is painfully contrived; the actors obviously stuck to the script at all times, for better or worse. Furthermore, the male supporting cast will have you rolling your eyes at their idiotic behavior. Even in the midst of murder and other evils, one of these losers continually attempts to ""get some"" from the female characters.

As a whole, Last Resort fails on a number of levels. Even so, it had its moments. The amateur cast did surprisingly well, and the plot isn't as inane as it should have been. If you have free time on your hands and you're looking for some skin, some violence, and some gore, you could do a whole lot worse than Last Resort. Just keep in mind that it's still a lower-tier B-movie.",1387929600,,1725,4.540192926045016

The only place of refuge is an old abandoned resort. This place is bad news, brother. It turns everyone into a homicidal maniac. There is some half-arsed history to the place, which is told through flashbacks, but does it make sense? Not particularly. Everyone is supposed to be ""free."" All of the men in this film are stupid sex and booze-driven a-holes. Or criminals. One character just disappears. There's a tussle, then he's gone. The Last Resort is 75 minutes long, including a heavily padded 6 minutes of credits. Is there anything that Lionsgate won't put their name on?
