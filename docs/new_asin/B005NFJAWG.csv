4846309,5,B005NFJAWG,"Simply put, the best television I have ever seen.  Embarrassingly overlooked by the Emmys and Golden Globes, The Wire flew under the radar almost its entire run.  Worth its weight in gold and definitely that of its $160 price tag on Amazon.  A small price to pay for a stunning HBO masterpiece.  Watch the whole thing from start to finish, the show is brilliantly written, acted and directed.  You will never look at television the same way again.",1226793600,33,447,4.67948717948718
4846310,5,B005NFJAWG,"The writing on this series is brilliant, the acting is inspired and the direction is impeccable.  A quick search on the web reveals the passion that most reviewers have for this celebrated project.  Add another vote here for greatest television drama yet created.

However, the plot is dense with characters and activity, and much of the splendor of the work is both the eventual entanglement of so many threads and, especially, the carefully crafted manner that earlier events later resonate in unexpected twists.  To view the sixty episodes casually and periodically is to lose grasp of much of the wit.

The best way to ingest this rich drama is at a steady pace, with full engagement.  As it has not yet been released I cannot say what additions in commentary and documentary might be included in this complete box, but having each episode handy for rapid rotation is not a bad thing.  As for myself, having watched the final episode this evening, I fear my current comfortable satiation will be replaced tomorrow by the cold realization that my television will have lost much of it's recent attraction.",1226620800,10,1107,4.887700534759358
4846311,5,B005NFJAWG,"A tortured, alcoholic detective (Det. McNulty/Dominic West) who care more about putting criminals away than he does about departmental rules or, even himself.  A homosexual modern day-Wild West gunslinger (Omar/Michael K. Williams) who robs and kills drug dealers and lives by a strict moral code of his own.  A drug dealer (Stringer/Idris Elba) trying to become legitimate, taking economics classes while starting up his own company.  A middle school boy (Michael/Tristan Wild), struggling to take care of his little brother and his addict of a mother, all while trying to resist the allure of the game and the corner.

  These are a few examples of the incredibly diverse cast of characters and actors that make up The Wire.  Just like the real world each of these characters (as opposed to caricatures) show signs of both virtue and vice, redemption and damnation.  This realism is incredibly important and effective in conveying the reality of the post-industrial city and its devasting effects on people and institutions.  Each season of The Wire focuses on different aspects of the city, following a different theme each season.

  Season 1 effectively examines the danger of being an individual in an organization, using Detective McNulty and a drug dealer (D. Barksdale/Larry Gilliard Jr.) who both struggle against the reins of their respective employers.  This issue develops against the thrilling backdrop of the drug war and an investigation into druglord Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris).

  Season 2 shows the death of work in the post-industrial world, particularly the loss of blue collar jobs.  This is shown through the port of Baltimore and its workers who start illegally importing items and dealing drugs to keep afloat.

  Season 3 artfully reveals why reforming these institutions never works.  Again this issue is examined through both a cop (Major Colvin/Robert Wisdom) and the drug dealer Stringer.  Specifically, Colvin makes his district a drug-free zone to combat other crime, while Stringer tries to go legitimate in addition to trying to eliminate violence from drug-fueled gang wars.

  Season 4 illuminates how kids fall through the cracks in schools, largely as a result of their hostile environment.  The tagline, beautiful in its simplicity, for this season points to the political nature this story by sarcastically claiming that this country pursues a policy where ""No corner [is] left behind"".

  Bringing this whole story full circle, Season 5 ties all of these problems together and argues that the media skews our perspective away from these important mattters to sensationalistic stories.  This storyline revolves around a perceptive, noble editor (Gus/Clark Johnson)
and one of his deceitful writers (Templeton/Thomas McCarthy) who is more concerned about Pullitzers than real news.  This season ends by showing how these issues create a circle of explotation and victimhood, a point made by showing how these drug dealers, cops, addicts, and even modern day gunslingers get killed, retired, and reform only to have their places taken by the next victim and predator.

  Throughout the entire series The Wire pursues and achieves a level of quality, insight, and empathy never before reached in any television series or episode.  It truly is the equivalent of a televised novel.  It is the first Great American TV Show.

  The acting is suberb across the board, from bit players to protagonists and antagonists (although these very terms are called into question throughtout the series).  Particualarly engrossing to observe are the can't watch, can't look away descent of Dominic West as Det. McNulty in addition to the admiration and disappointment of Michael K. Williams as he mesmerizingly displays Omar's singular moral code and actions.  Even the child actors that play the middle schoolers in Season 4 manage to deliver performances finer than most adult actors.

  As already seen, the story achieves both high entertainment and high art.  Although each season starts off slowly in terms of pacing, even the slowest episode has several major events that affect the entire season and series.  Sometimes these events don't seem important when they happen but, just as in every great novel, these events eventually are revealed as the earthquke they originally were with aftershocks that cannot be ignored.

  As if incredible character development, acting, and plotting were not enough, The Wire also excells in terms of production.  Similar to any HBO show, the series receives a budget clsoer to a movie than a network TV show.  This is reflected in the superb direction, fanciful cinematography and essential soundtrack.

  The series is even bookended by director Clark Johnson (Gus from Season 5), a symmetry that can be seen in the parallel shots seen in the first and last episodes.  An example of this is the simple use of an elevator camera in both episodes to highlight the theme of constant surveillance pursued throughout the series.  These shots also show the incredible and varied cinematography at work throughout the entire series.

  Finally, the soundtrack to The Wire creates the perfect atmosphere by highlighting these themes with a cross section of genres, subjects, and musical tastes.  Most of the time throughout the series there is no score other than the many different sounds and songs of the real world, heard only when you would really hear it, such as a song playing for the brief moment a car passes by with its radio blaring.  At the end of evey season, however, a song plays that captures the tone of the season, its rare appearance making the song and moment more emotionally effective and intellectually insightful.  Even the theme song perfectly complements and adds to the series.  Each season has a different band cover the theme song ""Down in a Hole"" in a different style that reflects the seaoson and it's thematic concerns.  Although it's not the best version, the 4th season features a song by a trio of adolescents, a choice that aligns perfectly with the No Corner Left Behind theme.

  Quite simply, The Wire is an entertaining, thought provoking, artfully acted, perfectly produced show that rewards (some might say even requires) multiple viewings.  It's a shame that this show did not receive the praise or attention that The Sopranos, for instance, enjoyed.  Of course, this is only fitting since the show is so far ahead of its time and its cable competitors.",1222905600,472,6456,5.166023166023166
4846312,5,B005NFJAWG,"Imagine a show that every critic on the planet loves.  Imagine a show so deeply layered that it makes every other drama seem simple.  Imagine a show where each character is equally important.  Imagine a show that reinvented itself every season, yet still felt like it was part of the world it created from the outset.  Imagine a show so complex that you will always discover something new the next time around.

Doesn't this sound like perfection to you?  Trust me, it is, in more ways than you can fathom.

THE WIRE is a show so meticulously crafted and executed that it would take me a dozen reviews to scratch the surface of what makes it great.  After catching the very first episode on HBO, I immediately bought the 1st season.  The rest, as they say, is history.

I'm so afraid to ruin anything that I don't even want to give away characters' names.  To even let you go in expecting certain traits from a character would spoil the fun.  So instead, I'm deliberately being vague about what occurs.  If you've never heard about this series, you deserve go in cold.

But I'll give you a few details, starting with the very first scene.  THE WIRE begins when a detective is questioning a young hoodlum who witnessed a murder.  The detective asks why the guy and his friends allowed the victim to continue rolling dice, after he'd been known to snatch the money & run.  The scene closes when the kid says, ""Got to, man.  This America.""

Then the show begins its title sequence, in which The Blind Boys of Alabama's cover of ""Way Down In The Hole"" plays over a montage of seemingly random clips of police activity & urban life.  But as you'll learn the more you see this title sequence (and song), this montage is actually filled with clues, both literal and metaphorical.  The greatest crime dramas throw clues in your face without telling you how important they are.  Believe me, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, one of the greatest films of all time with its labyrinthine plot, has nothing on THE WIRE.  And we're only just getting started.

What you'll also notice from the opening scene is the dialogue.  It actually took me two viewings to find out what the detective and the dice-roller were saying.  As if that wasn't enough, I eventually had to turn on the English subtitles just to find out what each character was saying.  The dialogue flows so naturally that THE WIRE never feels like a TV drama.  There are no scenes where the characters recap what happened in the previous episode, unless the characters would actually take a moment to remind each other.  This sounds like a challenge, and indeed it is.  THE WIRE requires (and deserves) your undivided attention.  Pause if you have to.  Rewind if you have to.  Use the subtitles if you have to.  Many have called THE WIRE ""a visual novel"", and they couldn't be more right.  You see how much attention I've given to just the first few minutes?  Guess what, the entire series clocks in at 63 hours.

So, what's the premise of the series?  The first season's main story begins when a team of Baltimore police is assembled to take down one of the city's high-profile drug dealers.  The investigators and surveillance teams endure what real cops would endure: long hours, cold trails, bad weather, tedious paperwork, crummy offices, and worse...smart criminals.  THE WIRE gives the justice officers an equal amount of screen time as the targets they pursue.  The dealers aren't delightfully vicious or glamorous in the least.  Sort of like the Corleone Family or the protagonists in GOODFELLAS, THE WIRE portrays its criminals as guys who either can't do anything else for a living, or refuse to do anything else for a living.  The series goes even deeper, as we're engaged in the lives of judges & lawyers, homicide detectives & their office-dwelling superiors, drug kingpins & their corner workers, and even the homeless.  Calling this ""epic"" is an understatement.  If you're as interested in the urban drama as you are in the police procedural, then you're on the right track.  Don't worry, you will get to see the cops bust a few doors and arrest a few thugs, but just be aware each event it treated as ordinarily and naturally as anything else in THE WIRE.  To the characters, these events are just another day.

Now bear in mind, I've only given a little info on the first season!  I won't give away any details, but Season Two continues in the exact opposite way you'd expect a sequel to.  The cops and criminals shared equal halves of TV time on Season One, but for the seasons that follow, they share equal parts with a completely new side of Baltimore.  Just wait until THE WIRE continues through its next few seasons, it gets even more deliciously complex.  If you think Season One sounds like a beastly Rubik's Cube, wait until you get a load of Season Two, not to mention the seasons afterwards.  After all, you can't predict how a single story is going to proceed if you're too blindsided by how it begins.  One of the most interesting aspects is that slowly over time, THE WIRE becomes more than a crime drama --- the series evolves into a multi-layered epic, where crime is only part of the picture.  Each of the five seasons feels like its own individual story, but naturally connects with the season that comes before and after it.

I don't want you to be discouraged by this onslaught of convoluted storytelling.  There is a method to the madness.  Audiences (including me) are too used to knowing where we are at every given point of the story.  THE WIRE purposefully refrains from the kind of clarity we're used to.  This challenge that will stimulate your mind in ways that no other TV show has.  In so many ways, it's the kind of entertainment we've always wanted: Surprising yet Natural --- isn't that always the goal?

THE WIRE is so great that everyone is going to take something different from it.  This show can be interpreted in a million ways.  Nobody is right, and nobody is wrong.  How can that be?  Well, creator David Simon is to be credited for this neutrality.  Simon is as hands-on as any other TV series producer, writer, or creator.  Every single aspect of the show is exactly what he wanted it to be.  THE WIRE was never the victim of a writer's strike, or cancelled seasons, or poor broadcasting schedules, or any other excuse.  If there is a character or story arc you don't care for, it isn't Simon's fault; your personal taste just doesn't mesh with it.  Sure, I have one or two nitpicks about what THE WIRE should've been in my eyes, but not once did I believe it was for a lack of focus.  For example, one particular season takes a more didactic approach to the series.  We witness moral dilemmas with an ambitious mayor, unethical cops, and newspaper staff --- all tackle the immortal question, ""Do the ends justify the means?""  This more black-and-white angle is exactly what David Simon wanted to use.  I preferred a more gray-shaded tale, but Simon decided that this tale needed a more direct statement.  Now, even though this isn't my preference, I overlooked my own criticisms because this season was built this way.  There are a couple of other little things that might not sit well with some viewers, notably how the ""star"" of the show's cast disappears for most of one season (don't worry, you'll know it's coming before it happens).  The point is that THE WIRE never once strayed from its intended path.

I think that's what I'm going to take away most from this show: It tells every story it wants to tell.  It answers every question it poses, unless we're meant to ponder.  It forces us to sympathize with those we'd normally condemn, and to relate to those we'd usually ignore.  This television drama is a masterful work of art, from the page to the screen.

I'm going to close with this:
Despite my review title, spending a large amount of money on a complete TV series without seeing a few clips is clearly irresponsible.  I didn't type this review expecting you to drop a couple hundred by my words alone.  So, let's be sensible about this product.  If you can, rent the first few episodes from a videostore, or try to find the show in a library, or maybe even go on YouTube to find a few Season One scenes.

There is so much more I want to share with you, but it's time to use a lesson David Simon taught me:
I will say only enough, and make it your responsibility to discover the rest.  Enjoy!",1220572800,691,8403,4.596231493943472

My wife and I have watched The Wire probably three times from beginning to end via streaming, on-air or DVR'd.  We were mesmerized by the fantastic acting, characters, writing and feeling of the program.  Nothing in this seemed to be television but a glimpse into day-to-day life in Inner B-more.

It's hard even now to see some of the actors in other roles without thinking of them being Stringer Bell, Jimmy McNulty or Omar Little.  That is the absolute definition of a great character.",1523145600,,740,4.638461538461539

Anyhow, my opinion of this series.....pretty good. I'm just a little irritated by a lot of loose ends in this series. If you haven't seen the series, please stop reading my review, because it contains spoilers:

Did anyone besides Avon Barksdale find out that Stringer set up D'Angelo Barksdale to be killed in prison? Was the killer ever even caught?
Did the wife of the police officer, Cedric Daniels, ever find out he was sleeping with the prosecutor?
Did Marlo ever get his just desserts? I mean, nobody wants to see a killer walk free on a tv show, unless he's the GOOD GUY! Come on!
Did D'Angelo never finds out that Stringer was sleeping with his son's mother?

The answer to all these questions is....NO. One thing the audience doesn't like, is unresolved issues and cliffhangers. It really would've been nice to get some closure to everything mentioned aboved.",1517443200,,1186,4.752427184466019

The center pieces in several of the cases were missing one or more center tabs (pictured below), which causes the discs to fall out from even the slightest force (photo and video proof included). Of the five cases, each of which has four center pieces (one for each disc), this is how many are missing a tab:

Case 1: 3 of 4 are broken
Case 2: 1 of 4 are broken
Cases 3-5: 0 of 4 are broken.

Obviously season 1 has the most broken tabs and its the one I took a picture and video of. The center tabs also break off very easily. In fact, when I opened the case for season 5 the first time, none of the tabs were missing. I closed it and opened it again a few minutes later and one of the tabs had broken off. This is some of the worst packaging Ive ever seen and its a stark contrast with the quality of The Wire. Very disappointing.

UPDATE: Sent back the whole thing and was promptly sent a new one. Packaging was all good this time, but when I tried to watch Season 3 Episode 1, it began to skip. So I took the disc out, wiped it with a microfiber cloth, gave it a quick spray with compressed air, and gave it another go, where it proceeded to skip again... and again. The whole episode skipped pretty frequently with about 5 minutes in-between instances of skipping, making the whole episode borderline unwatchable since you're pretty constantly missing scenes. Only purchase this product if you're okay with tons of flaws.

UPDATE 2: Finished the show and just started a rewatch. Unfortunately, it looks like someone took a knife to the first disc of Season 1 and my player refuses to play it.

It constantly pushes homosexuality in almost all major characters, alcoholism, foul blasphemous language, adultery, lying to get ahead, murder, glorifies drug culture and even those who rob drug dealers etc etc. It's an act of masochism to watch this and many other shows like it, especially HBO fare. It tries to depict pharisees of all sorts scrambling for paydays in some sort of nostalgic light in season 5, newspapers have always been hacks for advertisers, ""news"" is what is approved through bought ads and the deadline is always about how profitable the paper is. It features the number one Judaeo-Masonic goal, the subversion of the Catholic Church and the eradication of Christianity as a whole in the form of mind control. Pharisees CALLING themselves Christians, this is mind control. Might I add that most of the major characters are British aka British-Israel empire judaeo-masons? I suspect the ""wire"" refers more to a garrot on the minds of the viewers more than any phone tap garbage. Why have a wire when phone microphones can be tapped directly since what, Echelon? it's pointless chaos like the Judaeo-Masons love to promote so they can bring about their satanic order, especially spiritual order. If you want to watch this garbage God help you as you'll be just more chaff on the barn floor, beware the reaper.",1507075200,,1960,5.071207430340557

4846410,5,B005NFJAWG,"I was born in Baltimore and raised outside it but left for 3 decades for work.  Upon returning at retirement I I was affiliated with several Baltimore City police officers.  I chatted with them reference ""The Wire.""  My opinion was that sex was way over-used to sell the initial series.  The lead character is likely the least likable lead character I have ever watched in any tv series.  The vocabulary, settings, mannerisms, dialogue, mentioning of locations and places and people in the dialogue, use of the ""N"" word by African-Americans, problems with drugs, stupid errors by police, brilliant efforts by police, banter and jocularity of the police, the city politics, and so much more are so damned realistic that I was unable to walk away after three episodes.  Although each season has many of the same characters as the last, each season carries a different dark theme about life in Baltimore.  For example, season 2 focuses on the longshoremen.  Season 4 has a lot about the schools and they do NOT hold back for political correctness!  I found the series ""dark,"" depressing, despondent, demoralizing but it was so damned realistic and accurate (for a TV series) that I could NOT stop watching it.  I would NOT say that I ""love it"" but it was so compelling to watch it that I ""had"" to give it 5 stars!  In the end, simply amazing TV series unlike any other I have watched!

JIm True Frost's arc over the length of the series is subtle and wonderful to behold. Season 4 was hailed as best commentary on black culture since original ""Roots"". ""Margin of Error"" episode of Season 4 is possibly best hour (or 55 minutes) of television EVER! Death of Idris Elba's character Stringer Bell brought incredible backlash at the time. Still powerful 15 years after inception. I love shows with literally dozens of good characters - spearheaded by Hill Street Blues and up and through LOST, but I rate this the best. I love to watch entire series at least once a year and this is one which demands to be seen sequentially. David Simon talks about comparing it to a novel and I agree.

--> Like all great stories, this tale gets to the epic by way of the particular: it is told truthfully, perceptively, with wit and humor, in the lives of individuals: police administrators, corner-boys, junkies, plutocrats, volume dope-dealers, and urban pirates -- corner-boys to heavy-drinking beat cops, to teachers, to international businessmen.

The first two seasons are some of the best seasons ever made for TV. Seasons 3-4 changed main characters a bit and was a little too ""urban"" for me.  I began to lose interest with season 4, but season 5 rebounded a bit and drew me back in, although I haven't finished it due to my over all decreased interest in the show. Too bad there were only 5 seasons. If there was one more season like season 2 instead of season 4, it may have been the greatest series ever made. Even the Sopranos had some ""down"" episodes, but IMO The Sopranos is worth owning and still the king. I hate to devalue my ownership of this boxset and the sopranos boxset by giving away this dirty little secret, but I would recommend spending your money on a one year Amazon Prime membership (which I already had) and signing up for the free month of HBO digital subscription now offered and watching the Wire and the Sopranos through them for free.",1482105600,,1042,4.338461538461538

4846471,5,B005NFJAWG,"There are already several reviews written about The Wire that I recommend as to why this show is the greatest show of all time.  This review is for the Blu Ray.  There were many that were dismayed by the fact that HBO wanted to do the HD widescreen treatment to The Wire despite the original creator's intent, to frame the show in the standard definition ratio of 4:3 for atmosphere, to show the claustrophobic environment that these characters exist in, among other reasons.  Many argued that the widescreen edition would not be cropped correctly.  There is some truth to this although I doubt that anyone whose first viewing of The Wire is the widescreen edition is going to notice.  Having viewed The Wire in standard definition several times and now the Blu Rays once the wider frames almost seem to exude a documentary feel to me.  I think my mind's eye tends to naturally crop the few scenes that don't seem to work as well for me.  Many, including myself, were thrilled that HBO let David Simon do his best to ensure that the HD version would not be terribly jarring to all of us that love the SD version.  On the plus side the video and audio is the best I've ever seen and heard from The Wire on my home theater.  Overall I highly recommend The Wire on Blu Ray although I won't be getting rid of my Wire dvd's anytime soon.",1472342400,28,1332,4.426229508196721

It seems a little dated at first and also might turn people off with its harsh subject matter (drugs, violence, crime, police), but after about 2 or 3 episodes it is impossible to stop watching.

Each episode was full of suspense, and it was often hard to pick which side of the law you were rooting for. What I found the most interesting is that all drug dealers aren't evil and want to do harm, but feel like they have no choice.

4846546,5,B005NFJAWG,"One of the greatest TV shows ever, paramount to the art of film and TV. In fact I would argue that everyone interesting in doing anything in Government, leadership, law enforcement, community service, education, and just life in general should be required to watch this show. It is pure genius, although there are many characters that come and go in various ways that are unapologetic the main character is Baltimore but while Baltimore is a unique city the show goes into issues that effect every city in America and society in general. The Wire is a social study of inner city life, law enforcement in big cities, politics and Government, the education system, and the [in]humanity of the streets of Baltimore and any other city. Various universities have used The Wire as the basis for entire classes to teach various social topics. Baltimore is real and The Wire is just as real with the cast being the epitome of Baltimore, a significant majority of the cast is from Baltimore and many cast members know the life of Baltimore because they lived it for better or for worse. In fact several characters are former convicts from everything from hired murder to top end drug king pins all portraying various characters to show us what its like. It would be a moral sin practically to ignore The Wire because David Simon, Ed Burns, and others are giving you a real treat. Other projects that David Simon worked on like Homicide: Life on the Streets (and the corresponding book) give you a glimpse of the broad view of how a city works but they don't go into detail, Homicide shows a law enforcement perspective with a lot of art and detail but only gives you a taste of politics. The Corner shows the other end of Homicide, the people living on the streets, dealing drugs and living in poverty and crime but The Wire ties that all up and adds so much more detail it will blow your mind. It starts off slow but I beg you to stick with it. By the time you finish Season 1 you will see a piece of art in the making of legendary proportions, and by the end of Season 3 you will see the bigger picture forming and a view of a city in an unapologetic and real manner. By the end of Season 4 going to the end of Season 5 you will wonder why other TV isn't as good as The Wire quite frankly. Its a massive learning experience, whoever you are, its a show that should be in everyone's life. This is truly a 5/5 TV series, I don't know how else to put it but this show is legendary. Do yourself a favor and buy the Blu-ray set and be surprised with how amazing it is.",1451088000,2,2556,4.383157894736842
4846547,5,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire. No, it's not a trip wire the title refers to the wire tap authorized to gather information on a major drug dealer in West Baltimore but it's also a metaphor for the thin line we can cross to get justice AND the thin wire that connects us all.

HBO paid to have this classic series to be updated with new high definition scans, re-framed for widescreen (shows shot in 1.33:1 or 4:3 are often thought to be ""old"" according to marketing done by the studios some time back just as black and white films were seen as ""old"". As a result, many people will not watch a show shot in full screen which is rather tragic) under the supervision of creator/producer David Simon.

This is the best I can do without giving away too much of the plot--trying to bust a major drug dealer  named Avon Barksdale,(Michael Kenneth Williams) Det. James McNulty (Dominic West of ""The Affair"") along with the team he is assigned to has to deal with the corruption within the police department in trying to nail Barksdale. Barksdale and assistant Russell Stringer (Idris Elba of ""Luther"")find themselves facing a competitor Omar who robs him of his drugs and sells them. McNulty's boss (Lance Reddick of ""Fringe"" and ""Bosch"") tries to balance the need for his strike team against the political demands of his bosses.

As I mentioned the HD transfer isn't in 1.33:1 but the good news is that one of the producers Robert Colesberry had originally argued for shooting in series in widescreen but, at the time, the final aspect ratio for HD broadcast hadn't been decided. As a precaution and to make sure the series wasn't locked into full screen, Colesberry had

The transfer for ""The Wire"" is nearly flawless--blacks are rich and deep. Flesh tones are solid throughout. ""The Wire"" was shot on film and looks like it. That's a good thing.

The audio has been remixed for 5.1 and additional languages include Spanish, German with subtitles in English, Spanish, French, Danish, Dutch, Finish and Swedish.

Special features are all ported over from the DVD's including 22 commentary tracks with members of the cast and crew. We also get three prequels that set up the series. You can watch them before or after with no impact on your enjoyment of the series. There are also four behind-the-scenes docs. The only new extras here is a Paley Center for Media event that gathers members of the cast and crew for a discussion as well as a Q&A on the series, it's impact and where it fits in today.

The packaging is very nice--a high quality cardboard case for the five BD cases. There's a thin cardboard slip case that goes over the whole thing.

A classy package for a classy series, ""The Wire"" was a no nonsense police drama that continues to be powerful entertainment and provide reflective moments on what occurs in the series.

Highly recommended.",1451001600,10,2825,4.700404858299595

4846558,5,B005NFJAWG,"H.B.O.'s ""The Wire"" is EASILY the most important television series of all time -- and MY PICK for the very best.

Yes, ""The Sopranos"" is excellent; yes, ""Deadwood"" is wonderfully profane and Shakespearean; yes, ""Boardwalk Empire"" is a fun look at the roaring '20s; but ""The Wire"" -- with its searing ""insider's view"" into a major (albeit fictionalized) American city -- trumps them all. (I'm sorry, folks, but ""Breaking Bad"" doesn't even come close!)

""The Wire"" stands out as the best in television because of its great writing and acting. This show is populated with wonderfully complex characters and very realistic (and explicit) dialogue. The characters and stories are exquisitely detailed and intertwined with others, which requires the viewer to pay attention or ""listen carefully."" (My Wife is new to the series and she learned very quickly that she can't just watch ""The Wire"" passively -- like she's watching a ""reality T.V."" show or an Adam Sandler comedy.)

I'm not going to say much more about the QUALITY of the show.... Like a masterpiece of literature, you need to dive into the show (or text) and discover it for yourself.

The video and audio qualities are INCREDIBLE. I was initially worried when Blu-ray.com published its review with those 40 screenshots. (Some of them looked a little noisy and strange to me.) But ""The Wire"" looks BRAND NEW -- and WAY better than I ever imagined it could look. I watched all five seasons on D.V.D. for over eight years (give or take) and this ""alternate version"" of the series is much, MUCH better.

The grain is consistent from episode to episode (and from season to season) and the colors really POP off of my 50-inch screen. Details are RAZOR SHARP. The wider (1.78:1) aspect ratio makes the show look more cinematic -- and I'm not distracted by any black bars on the sides. Also, as the Blu-ray.com reviewer indicated , IF you didn't know that ""The Wire"" was not meant to be in this wider aspect ratio...you'd never know it! Yes, you lose a little bit of visual information on the top and bottom of each shot...but you GAIN so much more on the RIGHT AND LEFT! The difference is completely NEGLIGIBLE.

Indeed, every episode looks and SOUNDS amazing. The folks at H.B.O. did well to REMASTER this show! Hats off!

I haven't watched all of the extras, but the content of the show more than makes up for the lack of supplemental material. The commentary tracks are all very interesting. (They've been ported over from the D.V.D.s., but they're still good.)

""The Wire"" is beyond reproach and this Blu-ray box set is a very attractive package. Admittedly, I'm a little biased -- when people ask me about my favorite movie, I sometimes tell them that ""I can't decide"" and then I change the subject and start raving about ""The Wire"" -- but this box set was WORTH the wait and the money.

BUY THIS SET!",1447200000,3,2856,4.741935483870968

Some people on the internet cast negative reviews on this story but you have some people out there that will disparage a free meal just because they can.

Don't listen to the naysayers.  This is a GREAT gift for anyone that's a fan of great acting, storytelling, and complexity.  Perfect for the upcoming holidays so you an binge watch!

4846579,5,B005NFJAWG,"I caught The Wire for the first time last year on Amazon Prime. I decided to dive in since it's been compared to The Sopranos (my favorite drama) as the GOAT. First season took a few episodes to get into, the 2nd turned a complete 180 which took even more time to get into, the 3rd was good, the 4th lacked McNulty and the 5th verged on unbelievable.

The first viewing of this show is nothing but a trial run. I bought the Blu-ray, watched it all again and holy crap. It's incredible how much better it is the second time you watch it. A second watch turned this show from ""good, but overrated"" to the best show I'll probably ever see. The density of The Wire is unreal. Knowing what's coming suddenly elevates everything that comes before. The stuff I wanted to fast-forward through the first time around had me on the edge of my seat. I thought S4 was meh at first since I kept wondering where McNulty was. Now I think it's probably the best season of television ever written. It's crazy what a second viewing of this show can do to one's perception.

Believe the hype. Just don't make your first viewing your only viewing or you'll miss what makes this show so special. There's too much going on to take it all in the first time. This really is the best show of all time.",1441497600,11,1275,4.308333333333334

The item arrived fast and in great condition.  Been watching this item for months waiting for the price to go down and it did at $80 so I immediately bought it because this is one of those great TV shoes that are for keeps, something you'd want to watch at least every 3-5 years, maybe even every year.  Also, it's so nice that  aside from UltraViolet, you can also redeem digital copies of all 60 episodes + 3 minisodes (prequels) on iTunes.

The storyline, jumping from the projects, to the harbor, to the schools , to the newspaper is unique and the writing and acting is first-rate.  This show made no bones about using minorities in top roles and did not make them cardboard characters  but fleshed-out  human beings,  faults and all.

There's a number of things for the faint-hearted or first time viewers to know about The Wire before you jump in:

1. There is no denouement, no simple, clear resolution at the end of every episode ala CSI, NCIS, or any other typical police drama. On the contrary, The Wire is the epitome of the ""slow build"", it takes episodes to get started, much less finished. As in life, there are rarely any easy, clear resolutions at the end. Unlike the black and white worlds of network tv, The Wire is all gray.

2. There is not a simple, single story line. Rather The Wire is characterized by complex, multiple story arcs that can extend over more than one season. It demands (and rewards) concentration, rather than escape. Redemption and rev... Read more",1438905600,4,1010,4.694915254237288

4846608,4,B005NFJAWG,"One of my biggest complaints with The Wire, aside from being such a freaking bummer and not very satisfying to fans, was how terrible it looked on dvd. The show was produced on a very low budget and it showed on dvd. These blu rays look about 10 better. The big downside though is that they altered the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 1.78:1. Basically what that means is that it originally had black bars on the right and left sides of the screen but now the image fills the whole screen. The problem with that is that they had to blow up the image while cutting out like 10-20% of the peripheral image. So there are alot of  too-tight shots where you can't really see much more than people's torsos and head. Not a huge deal, especially considering this show never really had any great cinematography or anything to really miss. Most people won't ever notice that the image has been cropped. All in all, this is a much improved version over the dvds.",1435536000,7,945,4.4

Normally I'm more of a fantasy/sci-fi type (I count Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Lost, and Fringe among my favorite TV shows), but the writing, acting, and plotting of The Wire was just amazing. It's confusing at first because of all the different characters and story lines (think Game of Thrones but set in present-day Baltimore) but it's well worth paying attention. I really appreciate that The Wire takes a holistic approach to inner city problems - you see how parents, law enforcement, schools, and the media all fail young kids born into poverty, and you see people trying their best with the life they were given. The school season is probably the best season of television ever; it's heartbreaking but utterly captivating. I especially appreciate the nuanced approach The Wire takes with its characters. The cops aren't always the good guys and the drug dealers aren't always the bad guys; they're all people who are making decisions and dealing with the consequences (good and bad) of those decisions.",1432944000,3,1139,4.9375

4846634,5,B005NFJAWG,"This truly is the best TV show ever, IMO, and I've seen many of the contenders (MASH, NYPD Blue, West Wing, Sopranos, Hill Street Blues, etc).  I have probably seen the entire series 10 times or more, and just pre-ordered it on Blu-Ray. How David Simon created 5 seasons, each with a different primary theme, yet wove the characters and past story lines seamlessly into the entire series run is just amazing to experience.  Some people are down on the show because it is dark.  It is true that the over-arching theme through the entire series is the complete failure of the drug policy in this country that has existed for the past 2 decades, as well as a raw view of the devastation created in the wake of the combination of gangs, drugs, and guns in the inner city.  The character development is 2nd to none and is so realistic since no one is all good or all bad-there are elements of both in everyone.  It is also a pleasure to see numerous Wire alumnae showing up on current programs (The Good Wife being a great example as well as The Affair).  Seeing the the actor who portrayed Marlo's muscle Chris Bartlow, playing a minister on the Good Wife is just wonderful to watch.

Blu-Ray Update:  i know that David Simon was not happy with some of the scenes post high def modifications, but I must say, to my eyes, it looks outstanding.  It's jolting how much better it looks compared to the DVD (especially, if like me, you have seen the DVD series 10+ times and are used to the washed out colors and horrible blacks!)  in addition to vibrant colors and deep blacks, the facial close ups look great.  skin tones and finally true to life.

Amateurish and immature, to say the least. Speaking of dialogue, this series is so over-weighted in dialogue that it threatens to capsize at times.
If the writers could have gotten through that crap and concentrated more on actual police work rather than ""cute"" obscenities I would have enjoyed it more.

These are REAL police (or as they would say in the show POH-leece). These are REAL drug thugs. These are REAL politicians. These are REAL longshoremen.

I took advantage of my Prime subscription and streamed ""The Wire"" the first time, and was tempted into purchasing the DVD set when offered what I thought was a good deal last week. I had been warned that some people received inferior sets of these DVDs, and unfortunately I was one of them. One whole DVD was missing from the set and one DVD was damaged and froze and would not play under any circumstances.

To those of you who think Breaking Bad was the best show ever or up there I have to tell you to watch The Wire. It's much better but you won't be awed by it's superficial beauty. Approach it like a Balzac novel and you'll get the most out of it. The writing, logic, plot line, breadth of characters and their development just outshine most if not all other shows. Like any true great work of art it has many layers and it will grow with you over time. Every time I watch it I see new things.
You may not like it because it's not formulaic. Each episode is structured differently and each season has it's own rhythm and ending. You'll follow the drug trade from the streets, to the docks, education system, political system, and through the lense of the media. You will follow the stories of drug dealers, cops, crooked cops, politicians, teachers, students, drug addicts, ballers, strippers, stick up men, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. You'll have a favorite season and you'll find out that your friends will usually differ in that category. Some of the stories will move you, others will numb you, but you'll always be getting the realest show ever produced.

The series starts slow, but what becomes quickly evident is that it makes no qualms about showing life as it is, not as Hollywood thinks it should be.  Can a TV show reshape one's perspective on such hot topics as the drug wars, race, income inequality and political corruption?  For me...The Wire did.  I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this series from beginning to end.  It's an amazing show, and in the end, you feel like you get a real education.

I never saw it when it made it's run on HBO but decide to make a blind buy on it because I read about how it was one of the most realistic portrayals of police and street life. The show did not disappoint. If I had to chose a season that really impressed me, I would say it was the 4th season when the show follows the lives of the kids caught up in the inner city drug trafficking. When I read the synopsis of that season, I wasn't sold thinking it was going to be fodder since the focus is taken away from the drug dealing story and rivalry developing between heavy weight dealers. What happened was it gave me a glimpse of what was going on in the school system of the inner city as well as the lives of the kids in it. It was a personal awakening in many ways and caused me to have a deeper empathy for the kids that are struggling in the inner city knowing that many are caught up in a vicious cycle that's unbelievably tough to get out of.",1421539200,3,974,4.0

The Wire accomplishes this x10 but not because of the storyline, as much as you (really) care about the characters, as if you knew them or sympathize heavily with their daily struggle, be they Hook or Crook.  The Wire shows, you can be one but act like the other:):)

It's a superdeluxe Hillstreet Blues, New Jack City, GodFather, SuperFly, NYPD Blue, The Shield, GoodFellas Burrito.

The writing, the acting on this show is SO good that you feel like you're watching real people go through the business of living their lives in early to mid 2000's in Baltimore, not random actors just playing their parts.

Whoever casted these actors on this show knew what the hell they were doing. I don't think they'll ever be a show like this on television again. When the fifth season ended, I almost cried because it was like saying goodbye to group of people you fell in love with, and admired them not just for their strengths, but for their weaknesses as well, and I wanted it to go on forever.

I'm currently watching the first season of ""Breaking Bad"", and while it's a very good series, it's going to take a while to convince me that this series is equal to the ""The Wire"", because as of now, I don't think anything is, or will be!

How The Wire did not snag a few Emmys for at least best writing is just beyond me. Maybe it's gritty realism was just a little too much for the higher ups at HBO to take. It's a shame in any case!",1413417600,,1178,4.20353982300885

4846741,5,B005NFJAWG,"I had heard The Wire touted as possibly the best TV show ever made, but had never really been a huge fan of cop shows. However, when HBO content became available on Prime streaming I thought I would check it out one bored night. I was absolutely floored by the first episode, and now (2 months later...) after finishing the very last episode of the last season......I can only confirm that The Wire is indeed the best TV show ever made. If I'm being critical, the last season gets a little far-fetched, but even then is still a cut above anything else there has ever been on TV. The first season is a masterpiece, the second, third, and fourth are merely brilliant. There are literally 20 characters that you find yourself completely invested in - each one superbly acted and masterfully written.

4846742,3,B005NFJAWG,"Very uneven series.  I wouldn't recommend anyone buy the whole series unless they've got through at least season 3 and loved it.  The problem is the series varies in quality during each season and from season to season.  Seasons 2 and 5 introduce characters that we've never really seen before, and in the case of Season 2, will never see again.  The acting is first rate, but the writing is often verbose and overly sentimental.  Plagued by poor ratings during its run on HBO, this series is extremely unique and if you just want an entertaining ""Cop Show"" or a show that focuses on a few charismatic characters (like Breaking Bad or the Sopranos) you will be disappointed.  The series also has an underlying ""Pro drug Legalization"" and liberal attitude toward social issues.  This may be a plus or minus depending on your point of view.",1409529600,3,838,4.698630136986301

It's too sprawling and encompassing a series to adequately describe in a reasonable amount of space, so I will echo what a number of other viewers and a plethora of professional critics have already stated:  The Wire is a great series, among the best ever.

It's very realistic, and like a well made documentary, it investigates, informs, and exposes via a gripping, compelling narrative which consists of a number of storylines, all which intertwine with one another.

I can only imagine that the 5 star reviews are from an 'arty' perspective.

I got the impression that the Wire was more concerned with being authentic than it was in being good entertainment. I also think that they sort of made it up as they went along. The potential for a great climax often ended in disappointment. The best example has to be OMAR.

Omar was a star character and well, watch his final scene and weep!

The Wire falls well short of Breaking Bad and Deadwood. If you do watch it skip the first series and follow the fortunes of Omar - his court appearance is memorable.",1406419200,2,598,4.409090909090909

4846759,5,B005NFJAWG,"Just a few days ago, I joined the growing club of people who claim that The Wire is the best television series they've ever seen. ""Great,"" you might think if you've never seen it before. ""Another yahoo who thinks this stupid show is the greatest production ever made. How could it possibly be that good? It's probably just hugely overrated like Citizen Kane or The Arcade Fire."" The show Family Guy even worked in a good jab about people get literally brainwashed into thinking The Wire and Breaking Bad are the greatest shows ever. Can it really live up to that level of hype?

Well, I finished the series for the first time this week, and all I can say is that it truly does. I've seen a number of great shows in the past, but The Wire has accomplished things that I've never seen done before, and it commits to them with a level of quality that is unparalleled. With all of the reviews out there crowing praises for The Wire, what more can I possibly add? Well, I'll just jot down a brief list of what I think differentiates this show from any other, and maybe it'll convince you to take your first step like I did last year.

SPRAWLING CAST OF CHARACTERS: There are a ton of characters in The Wire from all walks of life, so many that it can at times be difficult to keep track of them all. (The only other show I can think of to feature such a large number of characters is Game of Thrones, but I haven't watched that yet, so I can't make a proper comparison). There are police officers, police bosses, homicide detectives, judges, lawyers, politicians, longshoremen, elementary school students, teachers, drug dealers, junkies, thieves, and newspaper staffers. More than that, almost every character has a full and developed story of their own, and you'll want to know what happens to each and every one of them. (I promise.)

REALISM: One of the many things that bug me about primetime TV programming is how black-and-white a lot of shows make everything out to be. The good guys, while sometimes flawed, are the good guys, and the bad guys are all bad. In The Wire, these moral lines are frequently blurred. Police officers and politicians often make decisions to save or advance their careers at the expense of others, and many drug dealers and junkies featured seem to be an inevitable product of their crumbling infrastructure, driven to commit crime because it seems like there's no other viable option.

Even more than that, it seems to me that mainstream shows like CSI or NCIS depict a crime force that seemingly has access to unlimited funds to run whatever tests they want in an insanely short period of time; they also have no problem pursuing leads or getting the appropriate paperwork signed because, of course, the agent in question knows best and must have whatever resources he/she needs to crack the case. In The Wire, it's hard to tell what the greater villain is, drug kingpins like Avon Barksdale and Marlo Stanfield or budgetary constraints. In Baltimore, there isn't enough money to go around, so high-tech or creative projects necessary to catch the high-ranking bad guys often get axed. In addition, criminal pursuits can be ignored or manipulated to serve the needs of the government. I've never seen a mayor tell Gus Grissom not to follow a lead because it'll nuke Las Vegas' crime stats and upset the voters.

Lastly on this subject, The Wire is straight with you about life. Sometimes the good guys fail, and sometimes the criminals get away with it. Sometimes life is good to you; sometimes it is mercilessly cruel. With The Wire, you never once feel like you're being pandered to or given a happy fantasy realm where justice is always served fairly, the government and its attached entities always try to protect your best personal interests, hard work is always rewarded with success, and unicorns frolic in the meadows with leprechauns and hippogriffs. I understand that some people don't care for such an honest and occasionally brutal look at life, but I do, and a lot of other people do as well. I also don't like being lectured by my fiction in a heavy-handed manner, and while The Wire has some pretty strong ideas about a bunch of things, I never feel like any of it is being forced down my throat. It isn't concerned with simplistic moral platitudes; it just wants you to realize that not everything in life is as simple as we often make it out to be.

THE ""VISUAL NOVEL"": David Simon, co-creator of The Wire, has often called his show a ""visual novel."" In this, he typically means that, like the chapters in a written novel, everything that happens slowly unfolds and feeds into later episodes. This runs contrary to mainstream television where, for the most part, every single episode wraps its central plot up in a nice, tidy bow with no unanswered questions (save for ongoing series arcs about a mysterious serial killer or a mole in the department or whatever). This makes for a complex and challenging show which actually drives the viewer to really think hard about what it is that they're watching, a show with no simple answers.

Not only that, but The Wire is similar to a novel in that, at times, it seems as though ongoing themes are almost more important than the characters themselves: big, profound themes like urban decay, corruption of authority, the struggles of the American underclass, the efficacy of drug prohibition, institutional dysfunction, the downside of unlimited capitalism, and the many, many battles that individuals wage with themselves and others on a daily basis. The Wire is, essential, the Great American Novel come to life, something I've never seen done on TV. It may not ever be done again, either.

SHEER QUALITY: This, at the end of it all, is probably the biggest aspect that kept me watching and loving what I saw through all 5 seasons. The dialogue, for instance, is golden. Each episode has at least 10 great lines to savor, including those that serve as the opening quotation of that episode (""Come at the king, you best not miss,"" for example - mouth-wateringly wonderful and infinitely quotable). The acting is brilliant, believable, and nuanced; I can't even name anybody as ""the best"" because everyone brings their A-game on this one. And the plot itself is fresh and engaging, often defying expectations and refusing to trot out tired, clichd story developments. Altogether, I'm seriously shocked that a series this good and groundbreaking exists as perfectly as it does. So very little of anything filmed, either TV or cinema, can go very far before network executives demand that the material be dumbed-down or simplified in order to make it more palatable to the American masses. The Wire's existence solidifies the notion in my mind that HBO is the premiere place for quality TV; AMC has really been catching up lately, but as much as I loved Breaking Bad (and anyone who asks me knows that I do), I feel like the The Wire is ultimately a better and more important show.

End of list.

Wow. That's a lot to say about a TV show in a mere Amazon review, and if nobody's reading this little summary, I wouldn't blame them for skipping out. Still, I've got to say all this in the hopes of attracting more potential viewers of the show. The more people shell out for DVD sets and/or subscription service (they offer all their shows to subscribers for free on demand, folks!), the more likely HBO will continue to put out this caliber of TV programming in the years to come. Not only that, it's just an amazing show, one that will forever change the way you look at what the medium of television can do. If I can get even one more person to watch it, I will have probably done them a immeasurable favor of which the dividends are many. So get to it, folks! Vote with your wallets and join the club!

This ""gaiety"" adds little to nothing to the stories and after awhile becomes offensive.  So, I find myself resenting the subtle preaching aspect that ""gay is ok"".  It may also explain the low approval and twice almost cancelled status of this thing.  There is too much trash on tv that something like this otherwise really good show has to be screwed with in this fashion.  The highly corrupt city of Baltimore is a good backdrop.  Season 2 taking to the harbor and illustrating harbor police work after the season 1 team cases are resolved and each team member is ""rewarded for excellence""  is a really good avenue to explore.

Corruption, degradation, demoralized institutions and poverty are perhaps staples in poor countries, but 'The Wire' shows that the problems that afflict the media, the ports, inner cities, youth gangs and unemployment are common everywhere. You get lessons and a broad perspective of issues in each episode.

I was reintroduced to characters that I remembered I loved, and also characters that had dimmed in my memory but were just as important to this great story.  I have thrilled again to the writing and acting of these characters that I cannot get out of my mind and my heart.  A journey that makes me laugh and breaks my heart.

Was totally worth buying the entire series instead of buying one season at a time because once you watch the first season you'll just keep wanting to go on. There are so many links between seasons that it is a perfect binge show, which is definitely what my generation has turned in to.
Also I ordered it on a Thursday night and received it Friday afternoon, so was completely impressed with the order and delivery time.

4846797,5,B005NFJAWG,"I am taking a class in law school called The Wire:  Crime, Law, and Policy.  I had never watched this show before I began watching it for the class.  We had to watch at least the first two seasons before classes began on January 6th.  Once I began watching, I found it hard to stop.  It just seems SO REAL.  Once I finished the first season, I went back and watched the director's commentary on the few episodes it is available.  After hearing the lengths the directors, actors, crewmembers, and writers went to in order to make this series I was quite impressed.

Although the content of the show is oftentimes unsettling, there are many moments of levity.  The characters, even the ""bad guys,"" are endearing.  It seems many reviewers did not like the second season.  I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first season.  This is a wonderful series that deserves any and all accolades it has received.",1391212800,3,902,4.5
4846798,5,B005NFJAWG,"I recently purchased The Wire and spent the next 5 days (yes, I did sleep, work...some, and eat...probably too much) engrossed in the seedy side of Baltimore. Where was I when this aired on HBO? The character-studies are brilliant. The actors are very well cast and are truly committed to their roles. The series is at once riveting and heart-breaking. I did have an issue with a single disc. Naturally, it happened to be the series 4 finale! Amazon sent me a new set and it was fine. So there are real issues with the manufacturing. I would strongly suggest to any potential purchasers that you don't leave it unwatched on your shelf for too long, but rather jump right in and not only experience one of the best televisions series ever produced, but assure yourself that your product is 100% ok.

4846809,5,B005NFJAWG,"You cannot totally ignore packaging when writing an honest product review.  For some time, this kept me from purchasing The Wire when Amazon offered it at increasingly ludicrous discounts.  I'd rented it through Netflix and it was certainly a must own series, but the reviews of supposed disc-damaging presentation kept me from pulling the trigger.

Gunfire is surprisingly only shown a few times in series, so maybe that is the reason it took me so long to pull the trigger and buy the series for my own personal collection.  I finally figured I'd be glad to deface the packaging to gain access to such an important story.  The first time I opened my collection to start watching it, I was incredulous to find the discs easily accessible in standard book page holders.

That's the packaging.  There may be other versions out there that shouldn't rate well.  I recommend buying them anyway and doing what you have to in order to get at the excellent content.  The characters, plot, settings, acting... everything is so rich, it is worth the price.  Fantastic series you can watch multiple times and it makes you think.

4846850,5,B005NFJAWG,"Perhaps the best police procedural series ever. Character-driven, realistic story lines (some of the funniest parts of the script are taken directly from David Simon's original non-fiction book, ""Homicide"") & you can't beat the screenwriting (Simon, George Pelecanos, Richard Price - WOW). I particularly liked season 4, in which a detective who has been kicked from the force ends up teaching math at a city alternative school. This isn't a sweet, heartwarming ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""To Sir With Love."" The kids are a workout, people get hurt, not everyone succeeds, & just when the teacher is starting to get through to them, standardized testing requirements kill whatever joy there might have been in teaching or learning. I've taught in alternative schools, & this story arc was all too real.

My only complaint(s) are with the DVD format. It's listed on the box as 4:3, which means that it was originally filmed for the old square screen settings, rather than for today's widescreen TVs. Depending on your DVD controller, you have two options: you can watch it in widescreen, which makes normal people appear to be about 20 lbs overweight & heavyset folks look positively grotesque; or you can watch it in a ""narrow"" setting which displays the picture in the original square screen format, where the actors' bodies appear normal but 20% of the screen on either side of the picture is blacked out. Also, the producers used locals for many of the roles, & the screenwriters wrote realistic dialogue (much of it sounds ad libbed), so it can be extremely difficult to understand what the characters are saying, both because of the Baltimore accents & because of their use of slang/jargon. I've read some reviews of the ""Homicide"" series that complain about the lack of subtitles & viewers of this series could benefit from those as well. But these are minor quibbles. The series is well worth seeing regardless.",1383350400,,1918,4.956521739130435

4846854,5,B005NFJAWG,"A few years ago, I worked in a fishmonger's on the weekends. It was hard work, long hours and the money was bad; there were some bitterly cold mornings when the only thing that kept the six of us in the shop going was banter - and Rankz, like me one of the newer guys, was always involved, his infectious laugh helped us take our minds off what we were doing.

Rankz - which is what he preferred to be called - came form Gambia, and was a happy-go-lucky chap. He loved to sing bible songs, even though he had an awful singing voice, and everyone was very fond of him. He had a girlfriend who he was intending to marry, and he seemed very contented with his lot. In the lunch hour we'd go down to the local bookies and place an accumulator on the football; while I would carefully go through the selections, he'd pick wildly - also making seven or eight bets on horses while he was at it. His bets were truly awful, and I used to take the mickey mercilessly. He always wore a Chelsea shirt with his name printed on the back, which earned a bit of a ribbing too.

One day he came in and was uncharacteristically quiet - his girlfriend had thrown him out of their flat, and he had nowhere to stay. I told him that he could stay at mine and sleep on the sofabed for a few weeks; news to which he visibly brightened.

Everything went well for the first few days - and then he got caught nicking cash from the till at work and hiding it down his wellies. God knows where he was planning to use such foully marinated notes. He was instantly fired. I got out my box set of 'The Wire', and told him to relax, sit back, and watch it for a few days.

The box set was a huge success - he couldn't tear himself away from it. I had felt the same when I had first seen it, so it was good to watch someone else suffering the compulsion to keep on watching episode after episode. He was hooked - I chilled out with him for a few hours and watched some episodes with him; he couldn't believe how good it was. I was pleased that he seemed to have had his mind taken off his girlfriend, even though he was staying up all night and hardly sleeping.

He watched the whole five series from start to finish, pausing only to eat, go to the toilet, and sleep. The last of those, not very much. In a couple of weeks there was nothing left to watch, and everyday life started again. Things started getting into a routine - I had my weekday job to keep me occupied, and Rankz had friends in North London that he was spending a lot of time with. I hardly saw him, but he'd pop by every so often with some cash to cover my extra expenses, so time went by fairly unremarkably for a few weeks; Rankz split up permanently from his girlfriend and life went on.

Then one morning I got a phone call at work from my next-door neighbour. He sounded shaken, and there was an edge to his voice that focused my attention immediately. ""Liam, can you come back home? There's two massive blokes here who are claiming to be the police, and they're turning your flat upside-down. I asked them for ID, but they just pinned me up against the wall by my throat"".

Although this concerned me to say the least, it wasn't until 5pm that I was finally able to get back home - and as I walked down the road where I live, there was no doubt that something unusual was happening outside my house - there were two police cars and a dog handler van parked directly outside the property, with another unmarked vehicle thrown in for good measure. I could see my neighbour waiting for me.

I walked with ever increasing trepidation towards the scene. There was a uniformed WPC climbing over the garden wall at the rear of the property - I could hear her calling for her dog, who had evidently decided that the grass was greener on the other side of the fence, and decided to do a runner. Two other uniformed officers, watching her, were providing each other with a running commentary and enjoying themselves immensely.

I told them who I was, and they let me inside my house. As I went into the front room, a scene of devastation met my eyes: where once there had been a carpet - a floor - there was now just a sea of tangled objects covering the surface; it seemed like they had just chucked everything about with no method or reason to their search, if that had been what they had been doing. So 'thorough' had this search been, that they had even tipped the cereal out of the packets, the plants out of the flowerpots, and tipped the contents randomly on top of everything else. The floor was covered by a six-inch layer of household objects; the floor could not be seen. I found myself being surprised at how much 'stuff' I had.

The two massive blokes were still there, one of them settled in my armchair, the other smoking a cigarette on the balcony. They explained that they were from Barnes CID. I explained that I was somewhat surprised to see them there, and a bit dismayed at the state of the place. They asked me if I was going to be 'any trouble', which gave me pause to think. I told them that it wasn't my intention to be. I'd seen their IDs, they looked quite easily angered, and getting them upset wasn't top of my things to do for the day.

""Because,"" the first one added sardonically, ""we can always order a DS of your property if you want to make a fuss. If you make trouble for us, we can make trouble for you"".

""What's a DS?"" I asked, not really sure if I wanted the conversation going down that route.

The second one came in from the balcony. ""It stands for 'Deep Search'"", he said. ""It's where we take the plaster off your walls to check that you're not hiding anything in them"".

I feigned astonishment at the extremes they'd go to. ""Oh no,"" I said. ""I'm not going to be any trouble"".

""Do you know a gentleman called 'Rankz'?"" one asked, as the other got out his notebook. I confirmed that I did. It transpired that they had stopped him on the street in the local area, and he'd given my address as his permanent place of abode. They'd arrested him, and had used the spare key I'd given him to let themselves into the flat and initiated a search. I pretended to examine the bits of paper they'd claimed was the 'necessary paperwork' as they gave it to me, while my head whirled.

It turned out that Rankz had continued his gambling habit after he left the fishmongers - to such an extent that he had started going into various branches of Ladbrokes with a pistol, doing a runner with the takings. He'd held up over ten branches in London, and - bizarrely - another five in Glasgow. To underline the point, one of them took out a sock and shook it. Something metallic rattled inside; he showed me the contents - bullets. ""We found these in your wardrobe"". It turned out that the dog found them, actually. The same one that was supposed to be conducting a search of my garden.

I was utterly astonished. Could this possibly be the same cheerful, funny guy I knew - would he really have been capable of something as crazy as that? ""We need you to sign a receipt for the things we're removing from your property - stuff that we need to examine further"".

My eyes were drawn to a transparent plastic sack in the middle of the room. I could see various bits and pieces - some items of clothes, some books. And the laptop I'd bought the week before. And the digital camera. ""All that stuff might be used as evidence if we pursue a case against him"" one added as he watched me. ""You'll probably get it back in a few months"". I had used them twice, maybe three times. They weren't impressed - the newness of my gadgets failed to move them. ""Although it'll probably be longer"", one added.

I weighed up the situation and decided to cooperate with them however I could. They took all of Rankz' property with them too. ""Don't leave the country"" they joked to me as they left. I laughed, trying to hide the hollowness in my stomach, and bade them farewell.

It took me three days to clean up the place. Along the way, I discovered that they'd not taken his Chelsea shirt, which had evaded them by hiding in the washing machine. I held it up in front of me and looked at the name on the back - Rankz. You stupid idiot, I thought.

Over the next few weeks, I had the surreal experience of watching closed-circuit footage of a friend of mine marching up to the counter of a Ladbroke's, taking out a gun and pocketing loads of cash before exiting the scene rapidly. It was impossible to deny - this was obviously Rankz, astonishing though it was to witness.

Rankz got sentenced to eight years at Her Majesty's pleasure. It was also discovered, along the way, that he was an illegal immigrant and would be deported when he had served his time. I didn't get my stuff back for 18 months - the computer was still in brand new condition, but already out of date by then.

Some time later, he 'phoned me from prison to apologise. He'd found Allah, he said. He was reluctant to go back to Gambia, as there were various people over there that he owed money to that you really didn't want to owe money to. I wished him luck, and we agreed that there were no hard feelings. I was relieved to draw the whole thing to a close.

I still watch the box set from time to time, although my enjoyment has been tainted somewhat by my experiences. I still wonder whether any of the above would have happened if he hadn't watched it. I'll never know, I guess.

The sniffer dog was found eventually, his brave bid for freedom dashed. They never found Rankz's gun.

4846865,3,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is a great show and I don't need to repeat the reviews that are out there for the show itself.

What I do feel the need to review is the physical product on offer here: the DVD's.  None of the discs include a ""play all episodes"" button, unlike every other TV series set in history.  Instead, they make you go to the main menu, click ""episodes,"" and try to remember which episode you watched last or were halfway through based on the title and a small thumbnail.  Then when you click that episode there's no way to go straight to the show, you've got to go through the ""in this episode"" blurb that tends to ruin major plot points.  That's a minimum of 3 clicks to start playing a single episode, and when it's over you get dumped out to the episode selection menu again so it's at least 2 more clicks for the next episode.

If all that wasn't a big enough PITA, HBO puts the scene cuts in utterly random locations and makes them 10+ minutes long. (when true ""scenes"" in the show are rarely longer than 5).  There's also no cut between the Title credits and body of the episode, so you can't automatically jump the Title after the 5 minute intro scene.",1376092800,5,1159,4.2889908256880735

4846868,5,B005NFJAWG,"I bought the box set when it came down in price because it was otherwise too expensive for this retired teacher. This was my second time watching a series that I promised myself I would not watch again, not because there was anything critically wrong with it, but because of the hard truths it reveals about an American city, its urban population, the sins of its politicians and civic leaders, and the decency and frustration of those who hold onto a shred of their humanity to make things better for the marginalized. Every episode bleaches away the myths of American exceptionalism and reveals a different tapestry of how we as Americans struggle with the illusions of personal, group, and institutional power. The collision is at the center of each story and the through line is ""the way out"" of impending tragedy. No longer are archetypes like ""going home"" or ""the journey"" or ""finding one's roots"" at the center of our literature, at least the literature of ""The Wire."" All the characters in this amazing, but thoroughly heartbreaking cast of characters, form a new archetype, one that neutralizes all other archetypes. In Season 4, for example, we are immersed in the Baltimore public school system. It's not enough that the good intentions of teachers, administrators, and educational theorists brought in to study some of the kids as if they were in a zoo, are neutralized by poverty, neglect and a whole host of issues symptomatic of many urban districts. There's something worse: The kids actually don't know how to sit down. The fundamentals of motion: we don't want them to move. They are totally unconditioned to learn. It dawned on me as I was watching why I didn't want to watch this series again. I'm conditioned to sit. To not not act, to not move. We are worlds apart. The bankruptcy of Detroit illustrates this. Where is America? How exceptional are we to let a city die? ""The Wire"" reminds me of the process of a city dying. The school episodes have all the microcosmic ingredients, and there is a certain amount of success in key sequences, as some students are rewarded to a nice dinner at a swanky uptown restaurant for sitting down and completing a project. But when these same students exit the restaurant they have no more understanding of what they achieved than how they were just rewarded. They have a sense, an instinct, that there is a better world, but there is nothing constant there to move them towards a better world. And all the characters suffer from this at some point. When a character does find redemption, it is only because someone is there to move him.",1375488000,11,2597,4.760532150776053

It has taken the crime drama to new heights, no longer revealing a Manichean division between heroes and villians. Rather, The Wire is a dramatic and sociological view of the human condition contained in a crime drama. The story revolves around drug dealers and the cops and administration who police and jail them. But the moral center does not reside with either group. And larger than the players in the drama is the city, the late 20th century American urban center, with all of its racial and class antagonisms, the failure of capitalism, and the generalized decay of American civilization. But really what draws me in is the careful attention to detail, to language, to the nuances of behavior, style, and culture that permeates the series.

4846888,5,B005NFJAWG,"I have just finished watching the wire, and let me tell you, it is awesome. Having worked in law enforcement for the past 7 years, I can say with authority that this show is exceptionally real. Cases don't get solved at the end of the episode, and many times the bad guys get away relatively unscathed. While I work for a sheriffs office of 700 in California and Baltimore Pd is an east coast department of several thousand, there are still striking similarities that anyone in Le can appreciate.

Firstly, the reality of working a wire. While I myself have not worked in that capacity, one of my co-workers was in narcs working a wire while the show was on air and he has said that it is very true to life.

Secondly, the politics of a department. I was continually nodding my head and laughing at the interactions between the officers and their peers and upper brass and their subordinates. I was able to sometimes interject a coworker I know seamlessly into a scene or character. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the dialogue in order to ensure that the characters acted realistically and didn't come off corny as many other shows (csi) do.

Lastly, the interweaving plots that span seasons and the grayness of characters. In real life almost no one is either pure evil or pure good. Everyone is a varying shade of gray. The most despicable drug dealer may have just shot someone one moment and in the next scene is shown caring for a younger sibling. Or conversely, the most virtuous cop, often the main protagonist Mcnaulty, may bust his butt to solve the murder of a witness, but at the expense of ruining friendships, family ties, and his own career. Characters evolve, cases evolve, and nothing remains static, just as in real life.

Believe the hype. Watch this show. The only warning I have is that once you watch those precious 60 episodes, you will find that there is now a void in your heart that can't be filled by the garbage that is on the air. This show is like a novel that you never want to end, and once its over its over.",1370908800,3,2054,4.469333333333333

It stands as a magnificent achievement for its creators and its cast and I have to thank HBO for investing its time and money is making this show. As many people have already stated, it is arguably one of the best programs ever shown. On the other hand, it portrays a gritty, brutal side of America that most people, including myself, choose to ignore and to look the other way. Meanwhile, others are condemned to live out their lives in the exact manner shown in the episodes. I cried over the corner kids and their inability to ever be children of the type I was fortunate to be. They are simply the raw material used by older men in pursuit wealth and power. The helplessness that government and the police and schools showed in attempting to address the problems are stains on the American dream. But you have to acknowledge the situation and ask what else could they do.

Without being accused of excessive hyperbole, I would not be able to say how wonderful is the writing, and incredible the acting, how very real all the characters are.  Unlike a great many shows, there are no stereotypes or caricatures in this program, but rather it shows humans in all their flawed glory.",1359849600,,466,4.658536585365853
4846926,5,B005NFJAWG,"Like the majority of HBO series, The Wire takes police procedural dramas to a new and exciting level, setting the example of how this genre should be done. Set in Baltimore, The Wire changes the theme each season, turning this from simply an entertaining show into a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts. With the quality of writing, this show has no issues keeping the viewers captivated and hungry for further developments, while never cheapening the story by adding your standard plot tricks and expected additions to draw stories out. Like a great novel or classic movie, the way all the elements of this show have come together, truly created something amazing.",1359504000,,721,5.067226890756302
4846927,5,B005NFJAWG,"The debate over ""The Wire"" realistic storylines and characters, really take away from the overall message - that in ""order to make things better you have to take action."" A criticism of ""The Wire"" is its lack of showing success stories, such as the work done by Baltimore's ACORN and Algebra Project. These groups mobilized families and teachers to pressure a Mayor to provide state funds to better the public school system. But that is in no way ""The Wire"" mission or intent to show its audience. Even creator David Simon explained that the show was meant to show the ugly side of urban city life and provoke action.
It is my belief that ""The Wire"" is has a lot of relevance today. It is fascinating that even five years after the series has ended, you can still see storylines and characters in everyday urban politics and even on some level the American nation. As a Philadelphia resident, I have witnessed the city become a place with some of the highest death and crime rates. Furthermore, the school system has completely fallen apart, as the neighborhoods and families fight with the city and school district over the reorganization of the system. In the ""Is The Wire Too Cynical?"" authors Atlas and Drier say that Obama represents the hope again as Bush ends his two terms, while paralleling this with the ending of The Wire. To be clear, I am a supporter of Obama and support many of his policies and platforms, but I believe he in some ways mirrors Carcetti. In season 4, Carcetti is the hopeful young politician who desires to improve the city of Baltimore, but when he gets into office - he learns that politics is a game and by season 5, he is more interested in look to the next election instead of his original mission.
Overall, I believe that while ""The Wire"" at times is a little exaggerated it does have relevance to our world. But most of all this should not be a ""pity party"" show that makes people angry, but a show that makes people driven to improve the problems in their own cities.",1359417600,,2006,4.5595567867036015
4846928,5,B005NFJAWG,"There has been much debate over The Wire in regards to its seemingly nihilistic and cynical view of inner city life in Baltimore. Many believe that it represents a reinforcement of white middle class stereotypes, that ""these people can't be saved"", and thus inner city poverty will persist regardless of our actions. To support this notion, they will claim that there are no success stories included in The Wire about community organizing or the citizens mobilizing to overcome the oppression of the systemic structures of their communities and societies. While it is certainly true there have been a number of real life cases of this in the city of Baltimore. It is also important to note that this is a fictional show that seeks to bring to light the crushing devastation that the social policies of local, state, and federal governments have wrought on these communities. It is by highlighting how these structures are detrimental to the health of our society that David Simon is strongly advocating that action must be taken, and that the best way to take action against failed institutions is to act outside of them. Further, many of the characters, such as Bodie, compel the viewer to have hope for them despite their surroundings. Bodie is a street level drug dealer who runs his corner so efficiently and profitably that other drug dealers are impressed by him. Marlow decides that what once was a corner of no standing was now a corner that Bodie would run for him, just like a successful franchise. Further, even police are impressed by Bodie's intellect when he is able to avoid a drug charge in Hamsterdam due to an entrapment defense. Bodie is just one of many complex characters that is shown to be smart, capable, and successful in the illicit economy. It is because of characters like Bodie we must consider how would his story line be different if he had lived in a different area of town? What if he had gone to a better school? Characters such as Bodie and even Stringer Bell are meant to show us that there are hard working intelligent people living in poverty, and that because social, economic, and education policies are formed in ways that give these individuals no voice in the system, they must resort to operating outside of the system. David Simon is the Upton Sinclair of those living in poverty, not ""the man"" reinforcing stereotypes to keep the system intact.",1359417600,,2390,4.803398058252427
4846929,5,B005NFJAWG,"Reviewing the year in television for 2012, Grantland.com writer Andy Greenwald wrote a fantastic piece (which you can find here: [...]) of how viewers on social media are becoming more and more obsessed with the plausibility and accuracy of  TV shows. Greenwald has called The Wire more documentary than drama, a standard that many people unfairly use when comparing a television series today. There are two basic ways of viewing and appreciating the realism of The Wire. On one hand, you can view it as entertainment, with fictional characters such as McNulty, Bubbles, and Omar that seem made for television. You watch The Wire for enjoyment, to see how these characters try to find a solution in the midst of corruption occurring in Baltimore. These kinds of viewers don't worry about the under exposed feel-good stories that John Atlas and Peter Dreier write about in their criticism of The Wire [...]. Then there is the viewer who recognize the characters as fiction but their environment as reality. They are fictional in a non-fiction world. They expose the truths of Baltimore through their fictional story lines.  This kind of viewer sees The Wire as more than a television program. They see it as an academic text, a lesson in urban policy. The Wire is about, as Anmol Chaddha, William Juius Wilson and Sudhir A. Vnkatesh put it, people who are influenced by their environment and how they are constrained by structural barriers (their defense of The Wire can be read here: [...])
In season one, the characters who play the police officers are fictional, but the corrupt system they face is real. The characters on the street might be fake but the drug trade and violence surrounding it is real. Yes there is some merit to say that The Wire only focuses on the bad issues, but Simon believes these issues need to be at the forefront when exploring Baltimore. If you question The Wire, than you need to question every news source you read today. No newspaper will ever put a feel good story on the front page instead of a recent murder case. This is how we perceive the world, and The Wire accurately continues that perception throughout its five seasons. Yes, The Wire might just be a scripted television show, but what you see and learn from it is real.",1359331200,,2264,4.7729591836734695
4846930,4,B005NFJAWG,"Cynicism in urban life is portrayed in The Wire but we must pose the question--is this actually real or is it just realism? In the Wire the characters all have negative attributes and personality traits that define them. In fact, it is hard to find a positive attribute in many of the characters. Although these negative attributes and vices tend to make the show interesting, it is hard to believe that this is reality when even the most despicable people seem to have at least some positive traits. Also, the Wire seems to ignore/fails to introduce the average working man and how they struggle to live or how they get by everyday. I agree that The Wire does do a good portrayal of social inequality like the article ""In Defense of The Wire,"" but this is not everyone in the projects. In reality, there are programs and people that care for and help the people in low-income areas.  Also, just because someone lives in the projects, doesn't mean they are doomed to engage in negative behaviors, although it might be difficult to avoid. In the article ""Is the Wire too Cynical"" by John Atlas and Peter Dreier it actually mentions all of the good that people are doing in low-income areas. In reality programs like BUILD and ACORN help children get through life in these low-income areas but in the show we don't see this at all. The only glimmer of someone wanting out was when Omar's boyfriend died and Wallace was so disturbed with the killing that he decided that he wanted to go back to school and exit the so called game. Even heroes in the show like Omar or Mcnaulty still have flaws that are difficult to see past. There is not one person in the show that someone can look up to. All of the characters have their major flaws. Atlas and Dreier's article has a good quote ""But like The Wire they draw a portrait of the African American poor as helpless and hopeless victims. There are no winners; just losers."" This quote shows that The Wire just focuses on one part of urban life but not all of it.",1359331200,,2005,4.493150684931507
4846931,5,B005NFJAWG,"I have raved in various earlier reviews, over each of the series  from 1 to 5.  There is no need for me to do so again for this collected Box Set.  Having watched each of the series again by virtue of possession of this set I can recommend it yet again without equivocation.  The production quality is of the highest and watching it again, some six years after the series completion, I am struck by nuances I had not noticed the first time round.  I would not want to ""spoil"" viewer enjoyment by stating what these were.  You will enjoy forming your own impressions.  I would suggest that this set is most likely to be appreciated by those who like myself, are already addicted to The Wire and who consider The Wire to be the finest docu-drama ever to be screened.  Such as us will be able to relive their favourite moments and favourite characters.  But the complete tyro to the genre should not be put off.  Please take it from me; it is vastly superior to The Sopranos or The Shield.  This invites you to come dwell on the street corners or in the rotten schools that condemn most of their pupils to a life of social futility and a probable early death.  As Bodie might say, ""True dat!""  Apart from the excellence of the series itself I would also recommend this set for the choice of Extras included, some of which were not available on initial release.  A word of warning however,  these DVD's are formatted for Region 1, and only transmissible in the USA and Canada.

I had to order the complete series. This series gives you a real-life gritty drama that is so much more than a standard cop/drug show. Throughout the progression of the series, the POV of many people is portrayed, including the drug deals, politicians, kids that live in the neighborhood, police, and middle men. It's difficult for me to put into words how good this series is. I watched it all the way through and it's still a great option to pop in the DVD player when I need something good to watch. The drawback is that the packaging for this set is horrible; many of my DVDs came scratched and skip a lot when I try to play them. The discs are stuffed into tight-fitting cardboard sleeves. I didn't experience this with my seaosn 1 set because the packaging is different; the discs are in plastic cases and well-protected from scratches.

This is a show of great cultural significance. There's never been a show like it. Even minor characters who don't have a lot of screen time have more fully fleshed out personalities than 90% of the shows ever made. This is truly a masterwork and needs to be viewed by anyone who considers themselves fan of film, drama, TV or greatness. A show this complex could be a disaster in the wrong hands. The stories of all characters are woven so perfectly together it can feel at times like you aren't even watching TV but are perhaps a 3rd person viewer of the actual lives of the people we see. I've never had the desire or interest to rewatch The Sopranos, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, Lost or any of the other great dramas of the past 20 years. I've watched the entire series of The Wire 5 times.

4846957,1,B005NFJAWG,"I absolutely love The Wire, and ordered a copy for a friend's birthday coming up. Unfortunately, I knew as soon as I received the product that the seller had sold me a very well crafted counterfeit copy of the 2008 release of the boxed set. The box color was off, so I decided to tear off the plastic wrap (which had what looked like an HBO sticker on it) and investigate. Here's some factors that helped me confirm my suspicion (borrowed from a post not written by me on ebay forums):

""1) HBO does NOT individually wrap each disc in these sets in thin plastic sleeves. All four of the sets I bought from eBay had these sleeves. (The one LEGIT Six Feet Under set I bought at Sam's Club immediately after the bogus eBay one did not).

2) HBO discs do NOT have the Season number and Episode numbers in the holographic section of the discs (on the underside, around the disc hole). REAL HBO discs have a few blocks and maybe a few (barely visible) sets of numbers, but that's it. These knock-offs have clear, readable Season and Episode numbers listed under the discs, most likely for the people working on these in the factory to be able to keep track of the discs in the sets they mass-produce.

3) The video quality of most of these knock-offs is pretty sub-standard. One TELL-TALE sign is the HBO ""TV snow"" opening at the beginning of every HBO show episode. On a good quality video (real HBO factory discs), the ""digital snow"" is pretty clear, with dots of extreme white and gray. On the bootlegs, the snow cannot be rendered correctly, and breaks up into blocks of digital noise. You'll also see the images of the very beginnings of many scenes breaking up and coming ""back into focus"" a second or so into the scene after a split second of this same ""blocking."" ""

I watched a few minutes of several discs to confirm the poor quality, and compared my neighbor's copy (which I had previously borrowed) to the copy I received. Someone went through a lot of trouble to fake this set- buyer beware! The seller immediately refunded my money, claiming that they had no idea that the set was fake. I repurchased the 2010 version through Amazon and am crossing my fingers that it is not also a fake.",1351641600,16,2195,4.466334164588528

One of the best shows of the decade (only The Sopranos and maybe Deadwood top it), it features concurrent storytelling from the point of view of Baltimore's cops and criminal underbelly. MAYBE half a star off for the occasionally lackluster corrupt union season, but even that was better than most shows would ever hope for.

Stand-out performances, particularly Sonja Sohn as world-weary cop Kima Griggs and Andre Royo as crack-head informant Bubbles.

The Wire is a great painting depicting the urban landscape with bold, fresh colors.  It is a great American novel that presents you with fully developed human beings living in an alternate universe (a.k.a., Baltimore, MD, USA).  It allows you to figure out for yourself what makes these characters tick, what makes the institutions affecting their daily lives tick.  It never whores itself out to its audience by giving them cheap plots, one-dimensional characters, or happy endings.  It is a stubborn, ugly mule of a show that demands that you take it as it is, warts and all.  You may not feel better about the state of the world after you're done with it, but you will walk away with more insight into the human experience.",1349395200,,824,4.6875
4846962,1,B005NFJAWG,"A lot of good has been said about this series, and all of it is absolutely correct -- it's one of the finest ever to hit television.  The problem here is that HBO apparently spent the minimum possible amount on the box set release.  The DVD packaging, while not literally the worst I've come across, is extremely weak, with discs wrapped in grocery-fruit-aisle quality plastic bags and jammed into paper cardstock.

But that's not the real problem here.

The real problem is the fact that, in quite short order, you won't care how much the discs get damaged by the bad packaging -- you'll realize that they were ruined before they even arrived in your hands.  Choppy, sketchy transitions abound, and at least half a dozen times the playback completely froze on my copy, forcing me to skip the entire rest of the chapter in order to proceed on the disc.  It got to the point where I would actually be happy when a disc would freeze only for a moment, instead of ruining an episode for me. I have a fairly huge DVD collection, and I can honestly say that I've had fewer playback issues with the entirety of the rest of my collection than I've had with this box set.

The dvd box set was taped together from the sender so the the box set box is ruined as well it was all dinged up and bent out of shape. It was shipped in a small box with none to very little padding or paper to protect the dvd box. Now to the box set itself. 1st each dvd comes in a thin plastic sleeve which is stored in a cheap cardboard fold out with a place to put each disc. Also disc condition is not great.

There is no main character, just an amazing flow of characters who intertwine brilliantly.  It shows you the struggle of life on the street in Baltimore while also showing you the affect of Police, Government, School and Print Media.  Some of those subjects might not seem like they're very exciting, but the way this story plays out makes you so interested in all of the characters and what they do.  The ONLY bad thing about this is the DVD packaging.  The set comes in paper boxes with plastic wrapped around the 23 DVDs.

It's a show that you either get or not within the first couple of episodes. With that said, I have fallen in love with it, and I get all of the bureaucracy and systemic issues that the show seems to present consistently. This isn't your your mom or dad's Law & Order or CSI in which each show concludes with some sense of conclusiveness. The Wire is far from this typical format. There is no sense of finality. It's simply complex, but thought provoking and definitely engaging with all of its complicated characters. It's real, gritty, and raw. Nothing is held back. Nothing is black and white. There are no easy solutions, and when there are characters attempting to implement solutions, it unfortunately becomes part of a greater problem. Without a doubt, systemic/bureaucratic issues run rampant throughout the series. It's not only present with drug lords/dealers, but also the appointed men and women that are fighting to keep these streets clean. Long after I finished this series, I still can't stop thinking how ""The Wire"" is applicable in every social system I take part in. Life changing, perhaps. Thought provoking, indeed.

I would like to have given this product a 5-star review, but the packaging just seems too cheap and flimsy.

It provides a great social commentary that can be adapted to most major cities and not just to Baltimore. I love how it shows that all parts of a city are connected...from the drug market to law enforcement to politicians to the school system and also to journalists. Somehow the writers managed to continuously tie stories and characters back together that may have been absent for almost a season.

This complicated story and all of its characters will change the way you look at inner cities, no matter what town you're from (I'm Houston, TX).

I'm still years later thinking of what the characters (many takes on real people right in Boston) are doing as time continues.

The director gave us actors we've never seen before and they definitely didn't let him down by acting like novices.

Young medium or old if think you'd like to learn more about the behavior of human kind when life isn't so kind this series will educate you like no other ever has.  From a look at how bad schools can be to how smart citizens you might think of as ""low down"" just are to how low those considered high brow really are and how very intertwined the both halves are,it will fill you in like no newscast or PBS documentary every has.  A look at mobs, not Italian, but societies of people you might not have ever even thought of.  Remember the script content was so accurate and in the moment the city police had to actually ask the show not to reveal some investigation tactics as just as we learned watching it with baited breath week so were those with less decent intentions.

The child thespians especially delivered like they were Harvard theater school graduates.  You believed the meanest were diabolically mean and you believed that the innocent were just that.  I'm not a person drawn to viewing filmed hideous violence between humans but this drama I made an exception for.

The lighting, the score (scores plural that is), the scars on faces, the camera work I mean I can't say anything all the other reviewers haven't said and more profoundly than I ever could, this was something else and I had to get my five stars in somehow.

This is the kind of show you actually shoved your friends off the phone, put away the dishes and made an appointment to see like in the Old Days.  Unless job overtime demanded, you wouldn't want to TiVo this and watch later.  No Way.

Could have been and should still be a full three hour motion picture. I'm all in if that happens but it would be some feat to make it equal to this production.

The only downside was for those who didn't have cable and instead saw only the hideously chopped up version on BET.

4847003,3,B005NFJAWG,"This is a quite decent police drama. It is very easy to get stuck with three four episodes in one go. So overall this is good drama, but it is not great. The stories tend to drag a bit too much. There is no justification for such a screen play in 2000s. I felt that the writers really tried to milk me; make me sit in front of the television a bit too much. They could easily have added 50% more exiting material within exactly the same format. This becomes especially apparent in later seasons which become more conventional. By session 4 it really drags with lots of social bulshitt about kids in school. Tedious with young gangsters crying and stuff. This is supposed to be a crime series, not some socially concerned drama.

4847004,5,B005NFJAWG,"If you're a fan of cop shows like SVU or CSI or NCIS or any other show that can't be bothered to be referred to anything other than initials, I IMPLORE you to watch the very first episode of THE WIRE and then try and go back and take any of those shows seriously.

I can't imagine that life as a cop or a crook will ever be more realistically or accurately portrayed as on display here in David Simon's THE WIRE. The only really similar show there has ever been has been Shawn Ryan's just-about-equally-brilliant THE SHIELD.

By the end of the first season, you will care deeply about our protagonists: McNulty, Kima, Lester, Bunk, Daniels, Ronnie, Prez, Carver, Herc, D'Angelo, Bubbles... all of them will hold a special place in your heart. You will hate the antagonists: Avon, Stringer, Nawls, Clay... and then there will be times where you alternately love and hate everyone as the series continues.

You'll be introduced to new ideas, new characters, new arcs, and new styles as the series progresses.

If you've seen it, you'll know of the episode where McNulty and Bunk are looking into a homicide crime scene and their dialogue consists entirely of one word.

That's the one breathless word that you will exclaim when you appreciate how great this show was, and the word you will utter in disgust and fury when you realize that it never won an Emmy. I've seen ER, THE WEST WING and 24 (which I actually loved) win Best Dramatic Series, but no props for not only a show that was far superior to any single one of those shows (some farther than others) and one of the very best shows ever to grace the small screen with its existence.

For quite some time, I thought honestly that ROME was going to be the best thing HBO had ever done, and while I still worship that show, THE WIRE has far and away taken the cake.",1336867200,5,1820,4.466867469879518

We also could not find this series on Netflix. So we found a deal on Amazon for less that $70.00 and made our investment. We have to say that the shipping was as expected and the product it self came in a decent box, and the DVD's were in sleeves wrapped in plastic. We have not had a chance to view all of the DVD's but so far so good.

We cut the cord on cable and use our DVD collection and our Roku, and Logi Tech Revue to view T.V. We decided we were tired of the trash on paid for T.V. We realized that we were paying for local stations and could view the same channels for free if we cut the cord. We did just that and put some of our savings towards adding great shows like this to our collection.

So it was a no brainier to add this item to our DVD collection. This has great actions, acting, real life reality.. If you like police drama, crime t.v. etc this is for you. Even if you don't like police drama or crime t.v. you will like this show. You will not be able to stop watching.

4847008,1,B005NFJAWG,"As I read among the other reviews, I am forced to add my 2 cents.  I can't agree more with the other poor reviews.  This is one of the all time great series, but the packaging of this is the worst I've ever purchased...and I collect a lot!  I even went as far as contacting Amazon and wanted to return the series, when I just gave up and kept it realizing I was just going to wind up getting the same thing when I re-order it.  I have never in my life come across more disk skipping and portions of disks that just won't play in a DVD.  No matter if I try playing the disks on my PC or my Blu Ray player, you get multiple disk skipping in a lot of the disks.  I think it may be due to the idiotic plastic sleeves they send the disks in.  Real flimsy cheap material.  And when there's the least bit of heat, the plastic sticks to the disks.

I'm trying to watch season 5 now on my pc, and so far this episode has stopped at least 10 times.  And these are brand new clean disks.  Oops, make that 12 times, no wait 13, 14, 15, crap..I give up.  Now it's stuck permanantly.

What a shame.  I don't know what else to say to the fans of this series who want the DVD.  Maybe they'll wise up and start selling a better package.  The series deserves it.",1334275200,8,1244,3.9556451612903225
4847009,1,B005NFJAWG,"Would you believe I bought this entire series without ever having watched a single episode?  Such were the reviews that it had garnered (e.g., here's Wikipedia:  ""The Wire has been described by many critics as the greatest television series ever made and one of the most accomplished works of fiction of the 2000"") that I was willing to pay that hefty price sight unseen.

Unlike every other 1-star reviewer here, though, I had no problems with the disks.  Probably that's because I bought mine from the U.K.  Apparently the ones sold there are outfitted with a different casing system.

And though I admit the series probably deserves more than one measly star, I give it only one because I would like to be the first reviewer here to frontally attack the content of the series, not the packaging.

For yes, I was disappointed.  There were aspects of excellence here and there, but on the whole I wish I had done something else with the two weeks it took me to get through this.

Before I start bashing on it, though, lemme start with the one big positive this series can boast.

There is one respect in which this series, while perhaps not the best series ever to have been broadcast, beats even the greats, such as ""Civilisation,"" ""Blackadder,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Singing Detective,"" etc., in one respect:

Namely, all of the various episodes establish and explore a single, drumming theme:  WHY NOTHING IN THIS GOD-AWFUL CITY EVER CHANGES!

Everything you see is aimed at that.  The storylines of all characters, all the plot threads, every episode, further this theme, so that by the end of the series, it's been irretrievably rammed down your throat.  Even though you might not know what they're aiming toward during certain scenes, you certainly won't leave the series as a whole wondering what the filmmakers were getting at.  The entire series coheres in a way I've never seen before, especially for such a sprawling epic.

This is no mean feat, to be sure.  I think it's probably easy to single-handedly write a work of fiction that has all its various storythreads tending toward one central thesis, though interestingly even the greatest novels in English (e.g., Ulysses, Middlemarch, Moby Dick) really don't.

What surely is hard, though, at least in the context of Hollywood, is keeping that vision, that theme, intact through the multifarious processes of financing and executive oversight.

So that's a big plus.  I'm blown away by that.  A solemn bow to the filmmakers on that score.  Heck, even some of the greatest works of liteature (War and Peace, The Magic Mountain) don't cohere as well as this does.

But I promised a negative review, so here we go:

The first big negative I can think of is that, despite comprehensively convincing dialogue, the portrayal of nearly all the characters is one-dimensional.  Instead of substantial, fully-fleshed out characters, we instead have actors playing bit parts.  I've read somewhere this was intentional:  many of these actors were hired for their ability to render nothing more than a caricature.

But the script also gives them bit parts, if you follow me.  They're not just character actors; they're character actors playing stock parts.

Every character in this series, even the ones the script apparently imagines it's fleshing out, represents a philosophy about something, some way of thinking, without actually being 3D humans.

Think of Gus in the newsroom, the embodiment of journalistic standards and probity.  But what else do you know about him?  Nothing, and nothing further is ever attempted.  This is true for virtually every character in the series.  They're not themselves, in a way; their job is simply to play a part, in the most shallow understanding of that phrase.  So for me characterization is a minus.

I'm sure the writers could bark back at me, ""Are you serious?  There must be over 100 characters in that series!  All of them can't be fully rounded-out characters!""

True, true, but even in cases of the more rounded-out characters, the writers had no idea what to do with them.  Consider McNulty.  They wanted him to be a kind of good detective but also a problem-with-authority kind of guy.  Beyond that, they had no idea where they wanted to take him.  Season after season sees the script not knowing what to do with him.

Or Bubbles.  Those filmmakers, to this day, are probably congratulating themselves on writing Bubbles, whom they certainly imagine to be one of their most well-developed characters.

Yet what insights, really, do they have into the life of a heroin addict?  Everything is so predictable and stereotyped.  I get the feeling that if I were to sit down in my garage for a half an hour I could write scenes exactly similar to all Bubbles's defining scenes using nothing more than my imagination and what I'd heard about heroin addicts on daytime television.

Even the way the characters interact bears no resemblance to human behavior as I recognize it.  I've worked in many industries, some of them high-stress industries such as policework.  In my experience, people do not constantly yell at each other day in and day out every minute of the day.  Sure, there's the odd episode of flaring tempers, but, if one were to take ""The Wire"" as a guide to human interaction, one would conclude that people in every walk of life lose their temper at the drop of a dime and yell constantly, almost in preference to normally modulated speech.

Actual police work is far more boring, more secretarial (not to mention dock work!). The only reason people are yelling at each other constantly in this series is simply because, on the TV screen, you've got to have constant conflict or the show will end up seeming boring.  Fine; I understand that.  That's life as a scriptwriter, dumbing down complexities.  But then how is this output being held up as an insight into human character?

Even the more memorable characters suffer from believability problems.  Like I'm so sure Omar would have come back from the Caribbean.  Also, Omar himself, to begin with, was a little far-fetched.  And Snoop.  These are memorable characters; yes, but they're so reworked with artistic and multi-cultural embellishments and sensibilities that they don't really represent the kind of people that are realistically doing things like this in real-life Baltimore.  Like I'm so sure the young, unproven, and unremarkable Marlo would be heading a massive drug operation.  My guess as to what happened:  the filmmakers simply liked that kid's face and demeanor, so they alloted him the role of nefarious leader of a drug gang without the script or the characterization's ever earning it.

Moreover, the script delves fearlessly into areas where it has absolutely no meaningful insights.  The docks, for example.

No, wait:  Griggs is a better example.  I get the feeling the filmmakers didn't know jack squat about lesbians or gays, or at least not more than any of us know.  But they wanted to include a main gay character to be politically correct and a bit provocative.

Unfortunately, watching Griggs and Omar in action (e.g., their cuddling scenes), you get the feeling you're just listening to dialogue written for straight characters that was simply grafted on to gay characters with little alteration.  Because these guys have no insight!  They should have feared to tread.

Most unforgivably, all the characters in the series are all either/or.  Either a head cop is ""juking"" the stats or he's working for the good of the community.  Either a mayoral figure is corrupt and self-serving, or he's corrupt.  It's like the possibility of a complex figure --  one who is both juking the stats and yet earnestly working to improve the community -- was a contradiction that never occurred to the filmmakers.  Everyone's fate is completely one-dimensional:  Dukie ends up slamming and that's it.  Mike becomes Omar and that's that.  Namond becomes the next Roland Fryer, Jr.  Reporters are either upright or corrupt.  There's no nuance to the portrayal of humans.

I believe shortcomings like this are ascribable to the fact that while the writers may possess useful insights about policing, the drug war, and the political process, their understanding of ""the human heart in conflict with itself,"" to use Faulkner's phrase, is no better than mine or yours.

So let's stick with what they're good at, just to be fair.

But what exactly is that?  Heck, even when the script tries for social and political insights, there's no subtlety to the core insights about government, the schools, and the police force.

Let's take the schools, as just one example.  What we are taught here is that schools are ruined by the ever-present prescription to ""teach to the test.""

This is largely true, but the writers evince no insight as to why such legislation was passed, or why the alternative can well be worse.

But I'll tell you:  crappy teachers!  Teachers who tell their students about the time their father lost money in the stock market and claim they're teaching economics.  Teachers who avoid topics in grammar because they themselves don't understand them.  Teachers who twist history classes into political inculcation gab-fests.

No, no attempt to wrestle with this problem.  Instead, the script presents everything as one-sided.  Opposing positions are comically distorted.

I regard this as being no minor drawback.  One constantly hears this series as being praised for being insightful, but when you really roll up your sleeves and start peeling off the layers to get to what it's good at, you realize that it's a show that's been cobbled together by second-rate, one-sided, data-ignoring ""thinking"" about complex issues.  At times the thinking is eloquently presented, but ultimately there is no depth or fairness to conflicting viewpoints or approaches about journalism, education, law, drug legalization, etc.

That program run in the basement of the school, for example, richly deserved to be cancelled.  Instead of preparing kids for high school by teaching them to write essays and do algebra, they simply sit around and talk about life in the hood?  Could you imagine if one of those students had been a young Neil deGrasse Tyson?  That kind of program gives up on the hidden promise of children . . . in advance!  No, kid's noses must be held to the fire whether or not they can see the relevance at the moment.

So, at the end of the day, what do we learn about Baltimore after watching this series that you didn't know before?  Nothing reliable.  I hate to say it, but all you're left with is a general idea of what the city looks like and that there's a lot of black people living there.

. . . Or wait!  Perhaps you claim that the series should be accounted great not for its insights into human character, not for its insights into the political process, but instead as an example of superb dramatic story-telling?

Hold on.  While it might be true, as I say, that the series as a whole is unified by a coherent theme, individual scenes and plot points aren't.  Many of them seem to be thrown in there for shock value or to round out the hour.  There are clunky mistakes that a master dramatist would never commit:  often the pacing is awkward, the tension mismanaged, suspense fumbled, foreshadowing muddied, and - something that really got my goat -- character arcs just wander off!

I've gone through most of the DVDs in the package so far, and out of about 20 disks that I've tried, at least 7 of them have given me read errors. I have had to use special software to recover the data and make these DVDs watchable.

Do yourself a favor and watch the Wire in another manner. I don't know if the single season DVD sets also suffer from the same problem. If not, they may be a better solution.

4847022,5,B005NFJAWG,"First, the 2 top noted reviews by Barry Mike and Christopher Strensud capture the fundamentals of why the show was great (especially at the time) - from the storylines, the story-telling, the actors, the character development, the production values, the writers/directors, etc. All of that is correct.

I'm only writing this add-on bit to note/warn about Season 5. Though I loved the idea of each season being unique - covering completely different topics and character settings/viewpoints - which was probably a first for any series, and I even liked the reporter angle, I just could not come to terms with McNulty's actions in this season. Yes, he plays out of bounds and it's all about his case, but I thought this went too far to be taken seriously and I was just annoyed the entire season.

Personal pet peeve perhaps, just wanted to warn others. This was probably compounded by what closure that was given for different arcs being so bleak. And such is ""life on the streets"", and that may be the point, but to wrap up 5 seasons that way was a let down. But my perspective may be skewed there because I found myself more engaged and cheering for Omar, Prop Joe, Stringer Bell and Prezbo than the others.

Minor notes. The premise of Season 1 was a bit odd - executive cops only wanting quick grabs and not seeing the benefit of a wire: thought that was a bit much. The show itself moves away from ""the wire"" part much in season 3 and 4 as well (though I liked those storylines better than straight cops and robbers).

Given all that I might tell folks to watch Seasons 1 and 2 for sure, and each season after only if they really feel compelled.",1329955200,,1649,4.542087542087542

The set I received appeared to be the real deal, but the video quality was really poor as if it were an illegal download that was then copied to the dvd.  I verified that it wasn't official by testing the DVDs in a region 2 DVD player and they worked just fine, which means that they are region-free DVDs not produced by HBO.  Upon closer inspection of the box it came packaged in I found some minor flaws as well.  I am not saying that all of the sellers selling it at a discount are selling bootlegs, but I'm just saying people should be cautious before purchasing.

I was immediately hooked, and blew through all five seasons in just a couple of weeks.  It's sometimes gritty, sometimes crass, sometimes humorous.  Although most (okay, pretty much all) of the subject matter was foreign to me, it still felt authentic...not all TV shows can achieve that.  It produced some of my all-time favorite TV characters.  Like Omar Little...he's a hardened criminal, but so complex you find yourself rooting for him, even when you don't approve of him. I won't recap the seasons (I'm sure other reviews have done so), except to say that the treatment of a different facet of Baltimore each season kept it feeling fresh, but the recurring characters kept it from feeling disjointed.  Excellent TV...David Simon is a GENIUS!  (Side note:  I used to live in Baltimore, and the second season concentrated on the area where I lived...my house could be seen in the opening credits that season!)

ETA: One of the discs for season 5 was scratched (or something) and skipped a little bit. It was only the one disc out of the whole set. A bummer for brand new DVDs, but it wasn't so bad that I missed anything.  Or felt the need to send it back, apparently.",1325203200,,1314,4.576923076923077

If you are looking for something else comparable to it (in terms of quality and subject matter), it does exist: try the DVDs from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) of the four TV series Phoenix 1, Phoenix 2, Janus 1 and Janus 2. Produced and broadcast between 1992 and 1995 they share/prefigure many of the best qualities of the Wire. Long term plotting that slowly builds, uncompromisingly realistic, an ensemble cast, natural writing and production (Alison Niselle & Tony McDonald), and innovative production techniques. Gritty realism that captures the reality of policing and the law and their inherent politics. Drawing on real events, they are set in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Phoenix 1 deals with the aftermath of a police bombing; Phoenix 2 deals with the drug trade; and Janus 1 and 2 move to the courts and an ongoing police investigation of a criminal family following police shootings. Fabulous acting performances from Simon Westaway, Paul Sonkkila, David Bradshaw, Peter Cummins, Sean Scully, Chris Haywood and lots of others. Only the mobile phones and hairstyles have dated.

The police characters are boring, even the ""lead character"" Detective McNulty is a total bore.  Also, the writers of the show force viewers to work overly hard to follow what's going on, often abruptly cutting scenes short to leave viewers ""hanging"" or under-informed about what just happened.  And the series in WILDLY UNEVEN in its focus.  Season 1 is good (if not a bit too plodding), with the story focusing on a police taskforce established to go after a major drug trafficking ""gang"" (Barksdale) in one of Baltimore's infamous ghetto ""projects.""  Season 2 is BY FAR THE BEST SEASON with the (mostly same) taskforce reestablished to go after a shady longshoreman's union that is involved with a ""Greek"" mafia in smuggling and theft operations on Baltimore's shipping docks.  The Barksdale gang's operations are also intertwined with the ""Greek"" mafia story, and the entire season 2 plays out like a very cool updated version of ""The French Connection.""  Outstanding.  But that's where the best of The Wire ends.  The remaining three seasons of The Wire go straight downhill.  Season 3 shifts its singular purposed focus away from cops vs. gangsters, and sets much of its focus on extremely boring stories of police bureaucracy and city politics.  It's a total yawnfest.  Likewise, Season 4 almost completely abandons the cops vs. gangsters theme the show was founded on, and instead focuses much of the show on 8th grade kids in an inter-city middle school.  Again, I found the result very boring.  Parts of Seasons 3 and 4 still focus on the drug-dealing gangster world of Baltimore and the cops, but not nearly enough, not like the first 2 seasons.  The last season, Season 5, focuses on the city's newspaper and media.  Again, boring.  Why make a ""cop show"" about cops vs gangsters, then change the entire focus of the show to politics, education and the media?  It's like making a show about football players and then changing the show to be about ballerinas.  A show called ""The Wire"" is suppose to be about police surveillance, phone tapping, body ""wires"" (listening devices) and the police investigations that go with that.  When the focus changed to politics, education and the media, then the show should have been called something else.

Why did I buy this product? I have been waiting to find this on sale for about two years. It usually retails (Best Buy for example) for around $170. Here, on Amazon, I finally found it at a reasonable price and couldn't pass it up.

Why should you buy this product? If you haven't watched the show before, I suggest you rent the first disc of the first season (MUST WATCH IN ORDER!) and see how you like it. I suppose, there might be people who wouldn't care for it, but if you like what you see, hear and feel... Then by all means, buy the series, it only gets better and better. (Except for maybe season two, which, although very important to the story and to Baltimore, it's not the most stirring of the seasons.)

Anyway, Buy it and enjoy it. Even though it's a big investment, you can't afford not to see this saga unfold.",1317254400,,1084,4.299019607843137
4847068,5,B005NFJAWG,"So I was a huge fan of ""THE SHIELD"" (gritty cop stories) AND ""L O S T"" (mind blowing story telling). THE WIRE is a majestic fusion of the two. Not that there are time traveling polar bears or anything, but the series is LOST-ish in the respect that all the characters unknowingly cross paths with each other and in the end your mind will be blown by the sneaky origin stories of your favorite characters....I.E. You see how Omar became Omar with out Omar even being there.... (boom!)W I R E.

Is this the best show ever? Probably a solid contender for the title. I have never been so satisfied with a finale before. So good while being filled with such a tragic stroy of Baltimore crime. If it's good to be bad, this show is just gangsta, I suppose.",1317254400,,749,4.3120567375886525

4847076,5,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is television for the patient, and for the keen.  It doesn't hold your hand, it doesn't resolve everything by the end of the episode (or even the season, necessarily), it doesn't tie things up in a neat little bow.  There are good guys and bad guys, but the lines are far from clean-cut--there's only one true villain as far as the show is concerned, and that's The Game, as the drug trade and everything it influences is referred to (as well as the institutions which shaped The Game).  Sometimes good people do justifiable if bad things, sometimes bad people do things for good reason.

However, while The Game is immutable, the players in it are.  The Wire has us following lots of people--written like actual people, acted like actual people, in a way that's believable, and as such, watching their progress is actually like witnessing the rise and fall of these characters.  You watch The Wire to see how The Game influences both the people on the street and the people higher up--whether they're players, civilians, government, press, or even schoolchildren.

The reason the viewer has to be patient and keen is because the show takes its time to let the viewer build relationships with the characters before events occur, allowing that much more of an emotional impact when they do.  Being keen allows one to understand why these events occur, because they'll have noted everything that happened to get there.  This makes the catharses you get from watching the show that much more powerful.

The Wire demands a lot from the viewer, but it rewards in kind.  It is well worth the money you drop on the show, and even with some of the most frustrating cardboard slipcase packaging known to man (two of my discs were significantly embedded in their sleeves, requiring a delicate hand to extract the disc without ruining disc or sleeve), it would be wise to pick up the entirety of the series if you haven't already.",1316563200,,1928,4.74251497005988

4847081,5,B005NFJAWG,"Greetings to All:

Why do I say The Wire is fantastic? Well, everyone here has said it all, so let me make this as possible and help anyone ""on the wire"" (or fence, but I tried to make a pun here...forgive!): Mr. Simon showed his genius as a writer in his grim and human portrayals of detectives and criminals in the other classic HOMICIDE LIFE ON THE STREETS back in the 1990s....if you haven't bought THAT yet, I suggest you watch it and THE WIRE will be an even more satisfying experience for you.

The characters in all facets of Baltimore life are shown and fleshed out so well that it truly is a heart-stopping drama that will have you drawn in until the final season. The manner in which the series is intertwined forces you to watch from beginning to end: yes, each season could be seen as stand-alone to a casual viewer, but who could ""casually"" watch this? Like Sons of Anarchy, to truly respect the time and detail invested in creating this opus, you must watch it all. I went though this complete edition while writing my MA thesis last year, and I can say that while THE SHIELD was good, this is REAL. Compelling and brutal storyline, brilliant cast and story. I got into this show well after it ended, and it was a shame that I heard it was struggling while on the air, but that again is indicative of the society we live in that necessitates force-fed sesationalist insults to our intelligence as opposed to facing the real world for what it is, especially in a city where African Americans are the majority and left behind to fend for ourselves in the midst of violence and apathy.

Get the complete series, watch, and please give your own interpretation here!",1314748800,,1676,4.488524590163935

I am currently re-watching all 5 seasons and enjoying it just as much the second time.

The packaging seems to have damaged more than half the disks. The little plastic sleeves shoved willy nilly into the cardboard slots are the apparent culprit. We have found several disks with long plastic threads, much like hot glue gun threads, on several disks. Others look pristine but won't play without skipping or stopping altogether. Very disappointing. We have put the offending disks into two different DVD players, three different computers, hopping around like rabbits til we find which piece of hardware might actually play the thing. One disk we had to totally give up on.

We even purchased a new player thinking it was our player that was at fault. Nope. It's the disks. I see HBO reissued it in 2010. Would actually consider re-purchasing the box set if the packaging was different. Since it isn't, I'll be buying it season by season instead.

Shame on HBO for this. If it was one disk out of all of them that was defective, that would be one thing, but to have angst over every disk that we play, only to find that three out of five are damaged, badly manufactured, compromised by the packaging, or WHATEVER the dang problem is, is too much.

That being said, if I had tried to watch it while it was actively televised from week to week, I would have lost my mind trying to keep track of everything. Having the series accessible on DVD makes it watchable and memorable. The show is complex, well-paced, and full of detail. If you have ever followed a television series, you will love this show.

This package crams the discs into cardboard sleeves inside the single box, protected only (and often not at all) by thin plastic-wrap-type sleeves. Not only are the materials the bare minimum (less than that, really), the discs appear crammed in haphazardly. Some were half out of the sleeves, some of the sleeves were mashed, and as a result easily a quarter of the discs had big jagged scratches you normally see only on rental DVDs, not brand-new discs in the box. I ran all the discs immediately through a player to check for damage, using fast scans, and amazingly found no image problems. I can only hope that I don't later find problems when I actually sit down the watch them.

Really, HBO, you couldn't have spent a few extra pennies to provide at least minimal protection for the discs of such a wonderful show?",1310342400,7,999,4.638418079096045

I've always preferred DVDs in the jewel case packing, although more and more DVDs are released in the eco-friendlier (I guess) cardboard envelope styles.  Both types have their flaws.  When I buy DVDs at Local Stores, I like to hold them to my ear and shake the box.  If I hear the DVDs rattling around, I presume the holding ring is broken and go on to try another box (I've been burned on damaged DVDs in jewel cases as well.)  Can't do that when you order on-line, so, even though I ignored your advice this time, I'm grateful to the thirty or so people that tried to warn me.  And the tendency is, for every person that complains, there's probably another hundred that suffer in silence.

Regardless of who's to blame for the packaging, sales of the show have likely suffered from word of mouth.  There oughtta be a recall.

4847092,5,B005NFJAWG,"'The Wire' has been off-air for nearly three years now, and many late-bloomer viewers (like myself) are discovering how deep this show is on an intellectual, social, and entertainment scale. Not only is this show a trophy piece for HBO, it is probably the best television series ever created.

If you are unfamiliar with the city of Baltimore, you definitely won't be after viewing this series. It tackles the hard, key points of urban society and its unfortunate decay -- from all areas in the city. The drama flows from the police departments to the streets, and from the schools to the print media. Every aspect of life is depicted on this show, which only lasted for five seasons (which, by the way, were five GREAT seasons!). The acting, writing and directing on this show is superb. There is no margin of error on this series, whatsoever.

I began watching 'The Wire' exactly one year ago, and purchased the Complete Series boxed set (2008 version) from a third-party seller. Unfortunately, it was a knock-off which featured the menus and discs as though they were the authentic set. The boxed set was a brick-style case. When removing the side shield, it featured a red/black interior, and five season booklets tucked inside. Each disc contained a plastic sleeve, which was also tucked in a slit inside the season booklet. This packaging was horrible!

A 2010 edition of the boxed set was released, which I recently purchased, and they changed it up a little bit. The box no longer features a light-grey complexion; it is now a dark-grey without a side shield. It also has a paper slip that covers the front, back, and sides of the set. To identify whether or not you have the new edition, which you should have, here are the things that are included in the authentic set:

1. Paper slip featuring the series' information on the back, the title card on the front, and the sides which cover the season booklets.

2. A dark-grey complexion instead of a light one.

3. No plastic sleeves on the discs!

4. Copyright 2010 on the back of the boxed set and on each season booklet.

If you have none of these, you have been either swindled or sold the wrong set. Make sure you finish the series before your 30-day return limit in case you find damages that require either a replacement or refund.

Enjoy the series!",1308528000,24,2315,4.6683046683046685
4847093,4,B005NFJAWG,"Bear in mind, this review may only apply to the 2008 version of this box set.  A new version (seen here:  [...]) has been released but I cannot speak to its packaging quality.

As many have already noted, the packaging for this box set is rather poor and can result DVDs being shuffled and scratched during shipping.  Of the 23 discs included, one of them was scratched deeply enough to affect playback for one episode.  Thankfully, placing the DVD in my computer's DVD drive (presumably, a more competent and sophisticated drive than my PS2) alleviated the macro-blocking and freezing.

But with that said, The Wire is the greatest television drama I have ever seen.  The character development, pacing and the depth to which it explores difficult themes are remarkable.  I cannot recommend this show highly enough.

4847105,3,B005NFJAWG,"This review focuses solely on the DVD packaging for The Wire: The Complete Series set, as of May, 2011.

A lot has been written about the packaging; indeed, it leaves something to be desired. But it's not that bad now. I'm not sure if they've improved it, or if my expectations were lowered by the bad reviews. From earlier descriptions, I'm pretty sure they've made some improvements.

It comes in an outer, flimsy, 4-sided cardboard cover. This piece is ugly and, you might want to just flatten it and set it aside (or discard it if you're not planning on reselling or anything). The set actually feels and looks much better once you remove that outer piece.

Under that is a solid cardboard box that is meant to sit horizontally, so it will not fit nicely into narrow DVD shelves, but will fit fine on a deeper bookshelf.  Not ideal for a DVD case, but structurally sound.

Each season is given its own cardboard DVD envelopes that fold open into four panels.  Set these down before unfolding them, and you'll be fine. No DVDs should fall out, and it should be easy to remove and insert DVDs without scratching them. While there is some inconvenience, I've definitely seen worse DVD envelopes.

Overall, if you've never watched The Wire and are just waiting for a good set to buy, it might be time to pull the trigger.

do yourself a favor - do NOT judge this book by it's cover; and make no mistake, 'the wire' IS destined to become a klassik, outliving - deservedly so - 99.9% o' the junk food that is modern television (even among hbo's impressive offerings, none has impacted me as deeply as has this series).  i cannot say enough about this project's commitment to quality in every respect, and i run the obvious risk o' repeating what others have already said here...better.  suffice it to say, i look forward to seeing this whole drama unfold as it was intended one day in the near future (but NOT with this box set - which i think actually dumbs down the original packaging...i will GLADLY pay more for the individual sets...)

The visual storytelling is first rate.  The characters are beyond well-developed - they are real people that I feel I could meet walking down the street or have met already.  The cinematography is beautiful -sometimes jarring, sometimes serene, sometimes dirty and gritty.  The only show that I've seen that comes close to tieing up a season so throughly is Breaking Bad.  If you like that that, you'll love this.

I had resisted watching the 'Wire' as I had little interest in the popular 'police' TV dramas such as 'CSI' and 'Law and Order'. However at the urging of my son I finally decided to give the 'Wire' a shot. What I found was an epic series, the best EVER seen on TV. Five stars is not enough, this is a series that is as educational as it is entertaining. The 'Wire' takes viewers into a world rarely seen or experienced by the general population and does so with unparralled realism. The numerous reviews here more than adquately describe the subject matter of the 'Wire', so there is little need to add to those naritives, however I did want to confirm the dead-on realism of the 'Wire' and the manner in which it addresses the cultural issues of today's inter cities. This is a superlative series that tells it like it is, with great characters exhibiting many shades of gray, but very little black and white.

4847114,5,B005NFJAWG,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but I had to put into words how I felt about this show. Simply put it is by far the finest thing I've ever seen on television. Not that I have seen every show ever made, but I don't need to. There is nothing else like it out there, and I don't think there ever will be. After Season 1 I was convinced it was a very, very good cop drama. Somewhere in the middle of season 2 I realized that there something special going on. In fact I would say this is the only TV show to really take full advantage offered by the long form TV can give you. Tons more characters, all of them more fully developed than any film can do in just a couple of hours.

In fact a downside to watching this is now I find myself comparing almost everything to it. And everything pales in comparison. TV or film. I do know now to watch anything and everything David Simon touches just in case anything remotely this brilliant happens again (Treme season 1 was just ok IMO...not bad though, high hopes for season 2).

If this all sounds like hyperbole, that's what I thought too before I watched it. I had friends who wouldn't shut up about it. All the gushing reviews online. I almost got sick of hearing about it. I thought ""it's just a cop show right, how good can it be?"" I was wrong. Sometimes things do live up to the hype.

4847118,5,B005NFJAWG,"My friend Dolu convinced me I needed to watch The Wire, and I asked for the boxed set for Christmas this past year.  It took a while to build and for me to understand the show, but that investment was worthwhile.  I've just finished season 3, and I have to say I've never been this impressed with a TV show before, period.

The Wire succeeds on several levels due to quality in production value.  HBO is head-and-shoulders above the networks here.  It helps they have hour-long blocks and don't depend on mid-episode crescendos to cater to advertisers.  The acting is phenomenal (e.g. Rawls).

The main credit, however, goes to the writers in my opinion.  The screenplay is brilliant and merges together a patchwork of parallel storylines into a coherent whole.  The characters are strong, authentic, and memorable.  Most impressive is how realistic the show feels - this creates an immersive experience of the streets of Baltimore.  It has to be difficult to write lines for politicians, detectives, and gangsters and to make all of them seem convincing, but that is what The Wire has mastered.

The show is not easy to watch.  Not that there is much violence... there's some.  There is a LOT of crude language, some nudity/sex, racism/homophobia/sexism... the show does not back down or censor itself.  You get the raw experience.  While the language is coarse, the show is mostly difficult to watch because of the heaviness of its themes and the personal investment required before it starts paying dividends - you need to watch several episodes before you 'get' the show, and you have to finish several seasons before seeing maximum returns.

""Crime drama"" is normally a genre I shun, but The Wire transcends the genre and achieves greatness as a general [dark] drama.  There is great commentary here on the intractable issues facing modern cities and societies.  The themes run deep and hit home.  The characters are unforgettable.  5/5 stars... And I'm also finally signing up for HBO.",1301184000,,1991,4.918918918918919

4847120,1,B005NFJAWG,"No need for me to go on & on about the incredibly poor quality of the packaging. That's been done. What I haven't seen is reference to the incredibly poor quality of the video itself.

I can understand the 4x3 format, but the quality of the picture is so poor as to be infuriating. Half the time I'm watching I can't concentrate on the story because I'm so annoyed at all the digital artifacts & smearing in the picture. It looks like someone took the original video, converted it to the lowest quality .avi, took that .avi & compressed it even further, then copied that onto a video cassette, copied that back onto a computer, then transferred it to DVD.

I downloaded the first season (not legally,) before buying the whole box set, thinking spending the money would be worth it for the better quality picture of the DVD. As Admiral Akbar says on Robot Chicken, big mistakey. I should've just downloaded the whole series, as the DVD picture is actually (much) worse.

Whatever you do, however much you want to watch The Wire, do not buy this box set. It's a ripoff, plain & simple. I imagine the producers had no say in the matter, because I can't imagine why they'd let this great series be desecrated in such a manner.",1301184000,8,1222,4.495495495495495

That being said: Buy this series from a reputable seller.  I bought mine when it was out of print, so the only place I could find it was Ebay.  Which left me no chance of returning it due to bad disc quality.

Maybe the newer releases are different/better than the one that I bought.  I have read that each disc comes in a plastic sleeve.  Mine did not.

Due to my love for this series I am currently watching it a second time.  On a different DVD player and am experiencing the same problems.  I am half way through the second season.  I will add anything anymore problems that I find after finishing the series.

The problems I have experienced are:  In the first season there are scenes that the video is very grainy.  In the second season 2 different discs run sometimes at a slightly accelerated speed.  which is very annoying.

Also as many have said the packaging is not good.  Especially for this much of an investment.

I came into The Wire midway through the fourth season while it was airing on HBO...stumbling upon it by accident while channel surfing.  The terrific writing and outstanding acting pulled me into the episode and held me for the rest of the season.  I then rented and watched seasons one, two, three and four to get caught up; holding personal mini marathons on the weekends (staying up until the middle of the night to get a whole season in....I NEED CLOSURE!), then waited with eager anticipation for season five.  I still have the series finale recorded on DVR and have been unable to make myself delete it.

This is the most compelling television ever created to date.  Warning:  Once you get started, it is difficult not to become addicted and sucked into creating your own series marathon...it is that good and that compelling.

My twenty-one year old daughter mentioned at the dinner table recently that a friend told her about this terrific television series called The Wire, and asked if I would add it to our Netflix queue.  A few days later, Amazon had it as a daily special and my daughter received it as her 2010 Christmas gift.  We are midway through season one and she loves it.

If you haven't seen The Wire, do yourself a favor and buy this collection.  You will not be disappointed.

Congratulations to David Simon and thanks!",1293840000,7,1459,4.65234375

This is a documentary exposing how it all works disguised as a drama about the fumbles, foibles, and victories at the interface of personal values and political/economic realities. This is about drug dealers, police, politicians, schools, unions, and newspapers written by someone who was a part of it all. Great art, intense drama, and in-depth education by a master storyteller and inspired actors. Every element from cinematography to music was excellent. The entire crew was on a mission.

4847155,5,B005NFJAWG,"This 23 disc series (covering 6 seasons) offers a fascinating view of inner city ghetto life -- and for those of us not into the jargon, we can use the closed captioning to help us understand. As with other HBO series such as the Sopronos, we are presented with complex characters in which we get to see the humanity of even drug dealers who are willing to murder others, and the greed and duplicity of those who risk their lives to maintain a civil society.
The series is not appropriate for young viewers due to its focus on the seedier side of life in which profanity, violence and crime are the norm rather than the exception.

4847159,5,B005NFJAWG,"I won't even try to match some of the brilliant and far superior reviews of this series found here on Amazon, but having just finished the series, I HAVE to write something so here I go:

What an incredible series this was.  I have never in my life seen TV that was more affecting than this.  I could pile adjectives on top of superlatives here, but I'll just say that this is as close to ""important"" television as there has ever been and if you haven't watched it yet, you're doing yourself an injustice.

From season 1 all the way through the end I was, quite simply, riveted.  I was alternately stunned, disgusted, angry, terribly sad, hopeful, and uplifted and I hung onto every single minute of this show as if I was living it right alongside the characters, both ""good"" and ""bad.""

In the end, I was exhausted and both very happy and very sad to finally leave Baltimore behind.

There were very few happy endings to be had here.  Life just goes on, and if you're looking for something a little brighter, a little neater, you'll be somewhat disappointed.  I wanted happier endings (even for the ""bad"" guys), but I realize that would've been a disservice to the narrative, so it was as it must.

It was just amazing and the fact that this show didn't sweep the Emmys every single year it was on speaks volumes on how we prefer our entertainment served up.

This gets my highest possible rating.  I rented the entire series and as soon as I finished, bought the box set.",1289433600,9,1473,4.455223880597015

4847161,5,B005NFJAWG,"I was a late convert to this amazing series. I wonder, had I caught it on television being aired once a week, whether I would have truly appreciated the magnificent achievement that is The Wire.

This is the story of a modern city in all its aspects: politics, education, the disintegration of traditional industry, modern media's lack of journalistic integrity,the reality of the impact of drugs, lawlessness, corruption, decency, hope and hopelessness.  One of its greatest stengths is that it feels real. It makes no allowances for the ignorance of the viewer of street vernacular nor does it indulge in the usual inane exposition generally associated with mainstream television.

It demands the full attention of the viewer at all times and draws us into the worlds of McNulty, Barksdale, Omar, Stringer, Proposition Joe, Carcetti, Marlo, Bubbles and so many other rich and intelligently drawn characters.

I cannot, in the context of a short review, adequately express how wonderful this series is and my admiration for David Simon, Ed Burns and the team of writers that they collaborated with knows no bounds.

The Wire is the best Crime Drama ever made with superb acting, writing, plotlines, story arcs, and real characters with depth and soul.

It is superior in writing to the Sopranos, Goodfellas, NYPD blue, and any other crime/cop drama show that you 'think' is good.  There is good, and then there is The Wire.

Yes, The Wire is all that and a bag of chips.

So glad it was produced on HBO and that they had the vision and foresight to fund it (even though it never caught on like Sopranos).

You have got to watch it.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",1287187200,3,583,4.443396226415095
4847166,5,B005NFJAWG,"I just recently finished watching this series, and I must say that it is the greatest show I have ever watched in my life.  This is the type of show that needs to be watched as a whole as there are frequent tie-ins with previous episodes and you'll absolutely need to watch them in order to understand what is happening.

If you're simply curious about getting into the show, there are a few things you must know.  First, this is a very intricate and detailed series.  Everything happens at an incredibly slow pace, but it is quite rewarding in the long run.  I can't wait to go back through the series to see what I may have missed.

Have you ever wondered how a city is run?  Or maybe how illegal goods are imported into the country?  Maybe you've wondered what a mayor goes through to get elected or what happens behind the scenes of the Baltimore school system.  All of these questions are answered in great detail alongside an amazing narrative filled with sometimes loveable, sometimes hateable, but always in-depth characters.

I have read that this series depicts these elements in an incredibly realistic manner, and the the fact that they managed to make it this entertaining is amazing.  Not only are you educated by watching, but you are emotionally involved with everything that is happening.  I know it's possible to say this about many, many shows, but I've never seen anything near the caliber of The Wire.

If you're into character devolopment, look no further.  The characters are quite unique and colorful.  Omar Little, my personal favorite, is a homosexual, shotgun toting stick up man who likes to whistle nursery rhymes while performing robberies; and he's one of the good guys!  Everyone has something special going about them, even some of the lesser seen guys (Walon, etc.) are awesome to see appear and re-appear.  The charisma and the relationships shared between them is also about as good as it gets on screen.  McNulty and Bunk, two homocide detectives and obvious close friends will have many interesting drunken conversations that promise laughter.  These are just a few examples as there are many characters, and they all come and go in relevance throughout the series.

Also, a lot of actual police officers, investigators, politicians, and even ex-cons lent their acting skills to the series to add even more authenticity to the characters, though most of them are small roles.

Again, this is a very detailed show, so get ready to pay attention.  I can promise anyone that it pays off once you find your groove.  A friend of mine told me that he actually watched it with the subtitles on which isn't a bad idea considering the amount of slang involved; both law enforcement and street slang.

As I said earlier, you're definitely going to need the entire series to fully enjoy the experience offered by this show.  I bought this particular boxed set and have had absolutely no problem with it, though some fans have been unhappy with the way this boxed set is presented.  Every season is seperated inside the box by cardboard folders that house each disc for that particular season.  It's not the prettiest way to house the 23 discs as plastic casing would probably be a safer bet, but I personally had no problems.  I haven't had a chance to watch the special features so I can't really say whether or not those are satisfying, but the show itself is enough for me given the price I paid for this.

In conclusion, if you're patient, willing, and interested in this show, wait no further!  Order now!",1286150400,8,3537,4.741407528641571

The actors are generally unknowns or little-knowns, so that the actors become the characters and the characters become real.  You see a lost generation of young men and women, many of whose families have abdicated their responsibilities.  You see a situation where the principal and most profitable business is drug-dealing.

The acting's wonderful, I know a bunch of the other reviews probably are filled with spoilers. None here, I'll just say this Bubbles is awesome as is Omar.  There are so many moments here, I didn't watch it until after it was long off the air. But when I did, I watched all 5 seasons over maybe 3 weeks. There were days I woke up and literally watched 8 episodes in a row. Only taking a break to use the bathroom and get something to eat and drink.  Season 2 started off weird, but I'm glad I stuck with it, because it made sense and by the end was actually very good. It's obviously a drama, but it has some genuinely funny moments. Herc & Carver as partners had me laughing more than a few times. The same with Clay Davis, but at at heart of the show there's nothing at all funny here. This is what television should be, the only shame here is the show was a bit early so there's no HD or even widescreen. I would absolutely be in heaven to have an HD version of this. While the pacing may seem slow to some, it lends to near flawless character development. I'm currently in the process of re-watching it in it's entirely, which I'll probably do about once a year.

4847186,5,B005NFJAWG,"Let me first review the packaging.

The packaging isn't the greatest and as a lot of reviews have mentioned, there could definitely be some improvement with the cardboard sleeves that you place each DVD in.  However, I hope you won't let that deter you from ordering this series.  As long as you meticulously wash that Doritos grease from your fingers and place them in the sleeves carefully, you shouldn't have any problems with the discs getting scratched.  They do sometimes fall out of the bottom of the sleeve and get stuck halfway inside the cardboard, so if it really bothers you enough you can place them in your own DVD cases for a couple of bucks, but I have never went to that length and am happy living dangerously and on the edge with these discs.

I can't review The Wire too much without giving anything away, and I would never dare ruin this show's greatness to one who hasn't had a chance to watch the series yet, so I will just toss a few of my thoughts out here.

I will say that many shows are proclaimed by the unwashed masses to be ""THE GREATEST SHOW EVER"".  See, I even put it in caps to emphasize how often this grandeur praise is tossed around.  I can't understate that if The Wire is not the best show of all time (it most definitely is), it is without question in the top 10 of all time, no matter what television critic you talk to.  For the record, if you are talking to one who does not believe that The Wire is beyond great, you should probably turn and run away, because chances are they wouldn't know what greatness was even  if it came up and punched them in the mouth.

To me, The Wire is not a TV series.  It is a true modern-day visual novel brought to life by the brilliant David Simon. I am fairly certain that in one hundred years, The Wire will be looked back on as the true apex of story telling for our generation.

If you are offended by violence, prolific amounts of cursing, rampant drug use, or anything of that nature you would probably not enjoy this series.  Let me say though, that everything that is included serves a purpose.  The violence is not gratuitous just to fill air time, but it all plays a part in the overall story of The Wire.

I don't know how to say this without offending anyone, but to truly reap all the benefits of watching The Wire, you have to be able to focus intently and have an above average intelligence to truly grasp all that happens from episode to episode and the meaning behind things that are only briefly mentioned from episode to episode, and in some cases, huge gaps of time pass before something that was referenced in an earlier episode appears at a later date.

Overall, I have watched this series twice all of the way through since purchasing it one year ago.  It continues to amaze me and I highly recommend the purchase.  You won't regret it.",1278720000,7,2835,4.375954198473282

The show is great because it takes characters that could easily be made stereotypes and instead turns them into multi-dimensional characters. As mentioned by other reviewers the Wire doesn;t provide any easy answers. Just because you care or like a character doesn't mean they will thrive or even survive. Unlike other shows that worry about protecting characters in order to appease fans The Wire constantly remains true to it's gritty and realistic portrayal. Characters (favorites or not) are constantly facing the consequences of their actions. this is a great show.

4847201,3,B005NFJAWG,"I'm not going to cover the series itself, you will learn more about America than you are going to like by watching The Wire.  It is outstanding.  There is a lot to say about the faulty design of this DVD set, however.  The packaging is laid out terribly and the video quality is average at best.  Some buyers are noticing problems with their discs also.

OK, time to learn what's happening in the world of DVD bootlegging.  Search for a website called: DHgate

DHgate is a kind wholesaler of Chinese and other Asian made goods.  There you will find a tremendous number of illegally produced dvd sets which are effectively exact replicas of the official version.  I did NOT purchase my copy of The Wire Complete Series here from Amazon but from a smaller online dealer in the US.  Although I figured out that my set probably came from DHgate.  Here's how you can tell:  My set looks real enough, the box and inserts are all complete.  The discs are even inscribed on the inner ring with an identifier that reads The Wire and says which season/disc.  But I first noticed some playback problems when playing my discs on a PC computer.  A surefire way to tell if your set is not official is to then check for region coding and if there is any copy protection present.  American dvds should be region 1 and always have standard CSS copy protection. Oops, there is none on my set of The Wire.  It is possible that a dvd set can have a zero for region coding, but no officially manufactured set from a major studio like HBO will be missing its copy protection.  So, for those who are complaining about poor quality, check your discs for region coding and copy protection.  Also look for any small misprints on the dvd box and inserts.  I contacted the dealer I bought mine from and without admitting that he had sold me a phony, he was glad to refund me half the cost of the set since you can buy a replica on dhgate for about $30.

Conclusion - Check out what you're buying closely and demand transparency from sellers.  I assume that sets bought from Amazon will definitely be official.  If you think that replicas are fine and DHgate seems like a great deal, don't be surprised if your money goes overseas and nothing returns.  I say demand fair prices from actual studios and record companies.",1275523200,17,2290,4.4891041162227605

The one star rating is based on the quality of the DVDs, not the show.  The show is excellent. One of my all-time favorites, in fact. I already saw the first two seasons on television and therefore wanted to watch the other three seasons and the boxed set seemed like a bargain at $129 (which dropped to $89 a few days after I ordered it, but that's another story).

While viewing Season 3 (the only season I tried to watch), the DVD began to skip and then to freeze up totally. I tried it on another DVD player attached to a different TV and got the same, irritating results.

I don't know if the DVDs sold as individual seasons are any better, but I just wanted to relay what many viewers have already complained about.  I returned the product for a refund.

It is very character driven and seemed to take very seriously the goal of showing us the dirty inside workings of many aspects of the bureaucracy.  It has plenty of violence and action to go along with some pretty deep characters that seem very real.  Not one character in the show is completely untainted, just like real people.  The show also examines morality from many different angles because it covers the criminals as unflinchingly as it covers the good guys.  Ultimately you realize that the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are parallels of each other in many ways.

I highly recommend this series.  It's one of those that doesn't always take the formula plot direction - sometimes an outcome is foreshadowed but doesn't come to pass, and that keeps you guessing.

4847250,5,B005NFJAWG,"I saw the entire 5 seasons by separate, but since I want to give my opinion about the whole series, I'm using the 5 seasons package to do so.

This series is just as good as underrated it is. I'm a TV adict and TV police series fan. Spend almost all nights plugged to the dumb box. I'm too a Netflix loyal customer ever since they started in business. Well, how did I learn about this show? Not by any TV advertising or Netflix suggestion, not at all. Two months ago I was just wandering in my public library, when I came across to the 3rd disc of the 1st season. Read the DVD cover and liked. Found the 4th and 5th discs as well and took them home, since then, could not stop until last disc of season 5 (yesterday night).

Is not strange that the series fly under the radar of the media targeted in the average TV/movies consumer. All reasons for that to happen are very well explained in the review Amazon shows as the most relevant.
There could be as well a couple of ""politically incorrect"" items adding to that. Tough street drug criminals, merciless killers, are however predated by ""suit"" vampires: lawyers, city councilmen, contractors, real estate developers, etc. Not wonder America is sunk in probably the worst housing/mortgage crisis of history.

The scene I enjoyed the most was when Omar Little and Brother Mouzone killed Stringer Bell, and to watch the city contractor/real estate shark that was feeding from Stringer, literally melting on the floor when bullets started to fly, fearing they will shoot him as well - as he surely deserves. Instead of doing so, Omar just laughed at him.

Another controversial subject is the Major Colvin plan for cleaning 95% of his district streets, by concentrating all the drug dealing in three small inhabited decadent areas, a social experiment called Hamsterdam, in reference to tolerant policy about drugs in european city/port of Amsterdam. Sadly, old conservative conventional uneffective approach overcomes social innovation and drug business goes back as usual, infecting a very much larger part of city streets and residents, while police waste time and resources street chasing lowest level - foot soldier criminals.",1263945600,,2180,4.852150537634409

And dear reader, I give you but one example from the Wire series, that stands as exemplar of that art.
My example is the cold case investigated by Bunk and (a reluctant) McNulty of a young woman who has been shot at night in her kitchen apparently by a gun man standing outside. The viewer already knows who the killer is. The scene in which the two detectives, watched by the caretaker/landlord(viewer), unravel the details of the shooting and retrieve the empty shell casing, using photos of the body, a tape measure and their minds, is drama of an especially high order, brilliantly crafted. As they progress they use (mainly) one expression - it begins with f and has four letters and it is vulgar. It sounds like the most exquisite Shakespearian verse. I reckon this is one of the great moments in tv drama and I've seen quite a few.

4847261,5,B005NFJAWG,"What can I say that hasn't already been covered by these reviews? The Wire is by far the most complex and thought provoking show in recent (perhaps all) television history. It's painfully realistic sometimes, the characters are nuanced and engaging, and the story itself is alternately frustrating and gratifying (much like life itself).

The first time I saw this show, my husband was watching an episode on TV. I watched a few minutes and turned away, completely bored and having no idea what it was even supposed to be about. A year or so later, we rented the DVD and started from the very first episode and by the end of the episode, I was totally hooked.

The best way I've heard this show described is that it's a visual novel. You have to watch the whole thing and pay attention the whole time. You wouldn't pick up a novel, read just the fifth chapter and expect it to make sense, would you? The Wire is the same way - you can't catch an episode in the middle, as they're all part of a larger storyline that needs to be experienced in order.

This set brings together all five seasons and trust me, once you get hooked, you'll want to watch all five. Unlike many shows which tend to decline over time, The Wire remains strong until the very end. The weakest season, IMO, is the second one, but even that one is still tremendous.",1258588800,5,1336,4.444897959183673

4847264,5,B005NFJAWG,"This series is terrific; I'm on my third viewing.  Not for the faint of heart; nor is it for those who don't appreciate police drama.

The protagonists are flawed and the antogonists range from good-hearted bad guys to psychopaths.  ""The Wire"" is thought-provoking in that it allows the viewer to carefully examine his or her views on racism and urban blight.  In its broadest sense, ""The Wire"" shows the slow disintegration of a once-important port city and the frightening reality of what faces the city's youth; that they are not just forgotten or lost, but have become like the ""untouchables"" of India.  Indeed, few are saved from this inevitability.

As for the diaglog, suffice it to say that I learned many new words as well as creative ways to use old ones!

""The Wire"" is a deeply-disturbing drama on one level; a 5-season friendship with an intriguing cast of characters, on another.  Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.",1256688000,,936,4.8427672955974845
4847265,5,B005NFJAWG,"HBO deserves credit and taking a chance with a show such as The Wire. It's slow, methodical, features a heavy African-American cast - all of which aren't good for ratings. But give the show a chance, and you'll find yourself deeply enriched by the experience and realizing that the war on drugs is more complex than you've imagined.

In an ensemble cast, Dominic West plays Jimmy McNulty - a self-destructive mess of a police officer who is obsessed in almost a Quixotic manner with bringing down the Barksdale family, the druglords of Baltimore's West Side. The Barksdale's aren't bad, as most shows portray drug dealers - they're almost sympathetic characters with their own code on the opposite side of the moral coin from the police. It's murky, but intriguing. McNulty's not driven by a sense of right or wrong, he's driven by the desire to prove that he's smarter than the criminals he hunts. Throughout 5 seasons, McNulty's life becomes a rollercoaster and eventually ends with a conclusion worthy of a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.

Each season takes on a new target. The first season is about the Barksdale drug empire, and the attempt to bring down McNulty's version of Moby Dick - Stringer Bell. The second season takes on corruption at the Docks (in the only slowdown of the series). The third season goes back to trying to take down Stringer Bell before he becomes untouchable and fully removed from the drug trade, while Bell fends off newcomer Marlo Stanfield. The fourth season, and the most emotionally rich, takes on the topic of the failing public school systems. The fifth, and most closest to David Simon, takes on journalism. Each season has a theme, and takes it head-on and holds a mirror to these organizations and causes us to look at them in a whole new light.

The show's complex with many characters that you practically need an organization chart in order to understand the layers of bureaucracy within the police department and the criminal elements. That's the strength: each of the characters are well written, and you want to know about them.

The show isn't about Baltimore, and could have been portrayed in any major city in the US or even the world. The show takes on difficult topics head-on and is a slap in the face about society.

If The Wire was a book, it would have won every literary prize out there. Instead, it's the best show you may have never heard of, but should watch.",1255910400,2,2420,4.752380952380952
4847266,1,B005NFJAWG,"Let me be clear: my 1-star review is based solely on the packaging and the physical presentation, not the show itself. This is, in my opinion, one of the best TV series ever produced. Other people have written much more detailed reviews of the show, so I'll let those speak for themselves.

That said, this is hands-down the worst box set design I have ever seen. It's practically impossible to get at one disc without others falling out, there's nothing to indicate which disc is which on the packaging itself so you need to fish out the individual discs to check, the discs are in a strange order thanks to the weird multi-fold design, and it's difficult to get the discs out of their pockets without scuffing or scratching them. HBO designers, take note: if your packaging design requires the discs to be in little plastic bags to keep them from getting scratched up when people take them out of the case, you need to re-think your design.

The individual season folders inside the case also have prominent season summaries, and the disc menus display episode summaries by default while selecting an episode - if you haven't already seen the show, expect to get a few inadvertent spoilers in the course of fetching discs and selecting episodes.

For such an amazing show and such an expensive box set, I'm actually considering buying a set of plain jewel cases and throwing out everything but the DVDs themselves. I expected more from HBO, and I expected more from The Wire.",1255824000,125,1477,4.717054263565892

It was brilliant in every way - the casting, the acting, the writing, the music, the depth and nuance of the little pieces of the big picture.  There are some scenes done with such elegance that I have watched them repeatedly just to appreciate the few minutes of absolute perfection held within that scene.  One of those exquisite scenes is at the start of Episode 10 of the Second Season.  It is held within the few first moments --  Prez turns on the radio, and, while ""I Walk the Line"" plays on, scenes quietly pass by, and Prez continues to arrange the suspect board.  Who, I wonder, had whatever surpasses talent to do something so simple and yet so absolutely compelling in its perfection.  The Wire is filled with those kinds of scenes, but also with seamless violence, and flawlessly flawed characters.  The end of this season is such a loss for me, who finds most of what is available on television to be absolute pedestrian dreck.

I'll spare you the storyline; it can't be summed up in one paragraph.  Essentially, it's a show about a city, where all the pieces matter.

Some call it depressing, but I doubt they've given the show a fair trial.  This is a great novel that can't be judged by the first 50 pgs.

Most TV shows explain, early on, which characters will be wearing the white or black hats.  It's the way of the medium: simplify for the simple-minded. 'TW' allows us to form our own opinions.  It doesn't need to explain; we're dropped into this world and expected to pay attention.  Some may be confused by this style; I hope it's a model to be copied.

""The Wire"" has changed all that for me.

It is possible to divide the world into two groups: those that say the Wire is a ""cop show"" and those that say it is a hell of a lot more than that. The first group have never seen ""The Wire""; the second group have, and are generally profoundly grateful for the experience. ""The Wire"" is simply an astonishly well-written, well-acted, masterful crime drama, a mosaic piecing together the living, breathing, bleeding city of Baltimore.

What makes ""The Wire"" so great, genuinely great? Firstly, the writing and pacing are phenomenal: there's Shakespeare, Beckett and ""Citizen Kane"" at the top, but David Simon et al.'s writing is only just behind. The dialogue is sparse and as viewers of another of HBO's shows, ""Oz"" will recount, peppered liberally with swearing; but dialogue is always intelligent, and crucially grants intelligence to the disparate characters in the story.

Secondly, the balance in terms of screen time is not the usual 80/20 split between cops and crooks; it is a more or less even split, making the lives of the drug dealers, traffickers and kingpins one that is allowed to breathe, grow, and mature over time. Again, the show is a crime drama, not a police show.

This leads me onto my next point. The show evolves from a crime drama to a drama about a city that just happens to be enveloped in crime: for instance, we see a police man, Bresboluwski, eventually become a teacher, which gives the show a chance to portray the school system and the lives of the neighbourhood children who are on the verge of going to sell drugs on the street corners of Baltimore. The lives of the dockers in the dying city port are covered in series 2, not the usual fare for TV cop shows. The crime is simply a way into telling stories of people in Baltimore.

The five series of ""The Wire"" portray in painstaking detail the struggles of a city, where expedient reasons force ordinary people to do often terrible things. I've kept this review brief because like all really great things, ""The Wire"" demands to be seen.",1249084800,3,2433,4.688524590163935
4847286,3,B005NFJAWG,"I received ""The Wire: The Complete Series"" for my birthday recently.  It's a wonderful series and a great gift.  Obviously I think that The Wire is one of the best programs ever made or I would not have added it to my Amazon wish list as my highest priority item.  However, instead of heaping well deserved praise on the series I would like to review this five season box set:

To begin with, it's all packaged in a box that does not readily fit in with my DVD collection unless I turn the box on it's end and then the name is not showing (I have an organized, alphabetized collection).  Inside of the box are five paper sleeves (one for each season).  They are the same size as a standard DVD case but open up horizontally instead of vertically. When you open them up each DVD is held in place by a paper divider.  This doesn't keep my discs from slipping out of their pages.  I own quite a few complete series collections and this is the least impressive packaging that I have seen for a major show.  Yes, it takes up less space than some other complete series but it doesn't look nearly as nice as most of them.

As far as the Bonus Features go, there are the usual commentaries by the directors, writers and actors.  The first season has no additional specials but here are the bonus features for the remaining seasons:

Season 2:  Episodic Previews and Recap
  Audio Commentaries

Season 3:  Q&A with David Simon and Creative Team
  Conversation with David Simon

Season 4:  A Behind-the Scenes Documentary in Two Parts
  * ""It's All Conected""
  * ""The game is Real""

Season 5:  The Wire: The Last Word
  * A Documentary exploring the role of the media
  The Wire Odyssey
  * A retrospective of the first four seasons
  The Wire Prequels
  From the Wrap Party
  Gag Reels...

Some of these features are interesting not none approach the quality and creativity of the show itself.  The Wire is a great, wonderful, fascinating series but I think that it deserved a better presentation than this collection.  Dollar-wise this is a good value but the individual seasons seemed better packaged.  Still, it is worth buying for the content of the shows themselves.

***** Five Stars for the Series
  *** Three Stars for this Collection",1247616000,18,2233,4.553299492385787
4847287,5,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is an excellent expose of the Baltimore area. The topic covered in the 5 season include the dru issue, the education issues, the police dept. and the city administration. David Simon is brillant in his interweaving of the strong political issues that are identical in ALL of them.
I highly recommend the whole series and the extra footage makes it all ""come to life"".",1247616000,,376,4.712121212121212

4847289,5,B005NFJAWG,"Yes! We love the series! Now, how about a review of the DVD boxed-set? The five-season boxed-set? Are there individual thin cases? Are there clam-shell cases? What?",1247011200,,164,5.111111111111111
4847290,5,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is the second best show ever to be put on HBO, right behind The Sopranos.",1247011200,,82,3.8823529411764706
4847291,5,B005NFJAWG,"It's hard to believe this is fiction.  As producer David Simon says, this is not just a ""cop show"" (I don't particularly care for those anyway).  It's not just about drugs, crime, the judicial/legal/penal systems, politics.  It's about all of the above and the complex interactions among them, the intricate disfunctional machinery that makes up urban America.  Find a big city and you'll probably find something like ""The Wire"" taking place within it.  In this case it's Baltimore, but it could just as well be Detriot, Chicago, etc.

The five seasons follow the lives of individual cops, drug lords and their suppliers and streetcorner distributors, inner city schoolkids and their teachers, politicians, dock workers, and media reporters.  At first it's disorienting to watch and make sense of what everyone is saying, and there are large profanity and violence/gore factors that you have to overcome.  But be patient; everything will lock into place after an episode or two and you will be well rewarded after the context has been established.

It is impossible not to be profoundly affected by these people and the situations they find themselves in, or have created for themselves.  And as they say in many of the discs' special features, you find yourself ""rooting for the bad guys and booing the good guys"".  In one way or another you care for these people.  Love them or hate them, this series establishes them as part of a world that is more real than anything else on television...including (perhaps especially) the news.  People generally don't want to hear about corruption and urban rot.  We all know it's there, we all feel we're pretty much helpless to do anything about it.  This series gets us to care by putting our faces right into it, showing us the human condition set inside parts of our cities that we've never understood before.  Having the series do this allows us to see urban issues honestly from many different points of view.  You feel that it's true, honest, and that the life story of each person in these communities matters.

The Wire is like a great novel; in fact, someone could write a novel based on the series' screenplays.  You can't stop watching it, talking about it.  My wife and I found ourselves watching three or four episodes in a row, so be prepared for devoting time to wathcing it.  We just finished our first run through several nights ago, and we're ready to go through a second time as we're catching our breath from the first time.

Yes, the quality of the DVDs is just fine.  The special features give important supplementary material and commentary which is exactly what you want included with this story.  The richness and complexity of the story and the issues it raises, the detail and dedication the producers have put into this production...all of this begs for some background information that the special features supply.

And you must see all five seasons.

Thank you HBO and everyone connected with The Wire for this accomplishment.  I agree with other reviewers that this is PERHAPS THE BEST SERIES EVER CREATED FOR TELEVISION.  We can hardly wait for David Simon's next series (I believe it's about inner city schools?).",1246752000,5,3187,4.87360594795539
4847292,5,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is great for a lot of reasons.  Among the many things I love about the series is the way it respects all of the characters as human beings, from ambitious politicians to cold blooded killers, from competent police to incompetent police, to struggling teachers, even (may God forgive them) to the press.",1245974400,,311,4.7592592592592595

In relation to the packaging, it is not nearly as bad as everyone has made out.  My box set travelled all the way to Australia, arrived in perfect condition, and remains so.  I should note though that I am very careful in returning the dvds to the case as the potential is definitely there to scratch them.

The scorn of those whose dvds arrived scratched is probably more testament to the passion The Wire evokes than the shoddiness of the packaging it comes in.",1245542400,,611,4.468468468468468

4847297,4,B005NFJAWG,"The Wire is probably the most unflinching docu-drama I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Each point of view is presented mostly unbiased and unromanticized.

4847299,5,B005NFJAWG,"Omar Devone Little, the singular best character on cable or network television - ever. Omar is portrayed by Michael K. Williams. Omar is a scary and well known stick-up man who lives by a strict code and never deviates from his rules, foremost of which is that he never robs or menaces people who are not involved in the drug trade. The fact that he is gay takes it to an unbelieable level of creativity from the writers and actor Michael K. Williams...Omar had three partners on the show. Omar makes it a point of never using profanity (but he'll kill a dealer in a heartbeat).

When the drug look outs see him coming, everybody deserts the streets and hide in their boarded drug distribution points...Omar still goes to the door and tells them to give him the drugs or eventually he will kill them - and they all comply, because they all know he is serious and follows his code.

My favorite situation is when Omar is talking to two plain clothes police. They are warning him that there is a bounty on his head by drug dealers and he should consider keeping a low profile for a while - Omar pulls on his cigarette, fix's them with a stare with attitude and snarls ""Omar don't scare."" ok, well maybe you've got to see it to feel it...trust me Michael K. Williams is reason alone to love this series.",1243209600,2,1300,4.4125

I tried it on my computer and had the same problems in the exact same places. No visible scratches, and it's the first time I've played the DVD, so it's a manufacturing problem - not something I did. (Others have had this same problem - click on some of the other 1 star reviews to see).

4847305,5,B005NFJAWG,"It is with great restraint that I describe ""The Wire"" as merely ""the best thing I've ever seen on television."" It's tempting for me to call this the greatest cinematic work I've ever seen, period, but I need a bit more time to contemplate that.

Here is the story of Baltimore, of the War on Drugs, of America. The characters of ""The Wire"" range from obsessive to idealistic to sadistic to almost completely amoral, but one thing ties them together: they are all cogs in a machine that is utterly immutable.

""The Wire"" is massive in scope, and plays out more like a series of 5 season-long movies. Individual episodes never stand on their own, and almost nothing is thrown away - seemingly minor characters and events will continue to echo throughout the course of a season. You cannot miss an episode of this series and you cannot watch it out of order.

The violence in the Wire is visceral, but not gratuitous. The street language used is amazingly colorful and entirely credible. The sets used are often actually in Baltimore, and the extras are often actual residents. Everything about the show feels real, in a way that I've never really seen from another TV program.

As the creators have noted, the main character of the series is really the city of Baltimore. The ensemble cast wends its way through the various organizations that infect the City: the gangs, the dock workers, the police, the politicians, the educators, the press. All of these systems are equally dysfunctional, and their systemic dysfunction ultimately infects the lives of their inhabitants.

It's easy to understand why ""The Wire"" was never widely accepted. It is not only much more complex than other shows, it's also horrifically bleak in a way that is almost never seen on American television. Please, please do not let that deter you - if you do not see this show, you'll be missing out on something truly incredible.",1239753600,6,1902,4.786585365853658

It's colorful, realistic, insightful, full of great characters and performances, and darkly funny.  (very funny).

The attributes of this show different from other great television shows are :

-  The degree to which it layers on itself over the course of the show.  By the end there were three or four dozen interesting characters each turning up week-to-week, each having great scenes, and each adding resonance.  Unfortunately people don't watch TV shows in strict sequential order, as one reads chapters in a novel, so a casual viewer wasn't catching all of the context and all of the depth on any given week.

I had read some good things about it, and although I'd never seen an episode I figured, hey, if I didn't like it I'd only be out a gift card.  I ended up devouring the 1st season like no show I've ever seen.  Usually I'm bored after watching enough of ANYTHING, but The Wire is different.  Instead of using up a few gimmicks and getting stale, The Wire drew me in with the excellent acting and meticulous script.

So, I ended up buying the entire series.  While waiting for it to arrive I bought individual episodes of Season 2 on iTunes.  Watching The Wire on a tiny 2-inch iPod screen is better than not watching The Wire at all.

I just finished watching the series yesterday.  I think I told anyone who cared, and a whole lot of people who DIDN'T, that I was mourning the loss of this series.  Not being melodramatic!

One thing, I wish I kept myself from looking online things about The Wire while I was still watching it.  I had WAYYYY too many plot points revealed by sadistic big mouths.

4847316,4,B005NFJAWG,"Let there be no doubt about it, The Wire (along with Six Feet Under) is simply the best series EVER to appear on TV. No need to go into the plot lines other reviewers have done a fine job of that. I would only add that the music CD is Essential, even if you are not interested in the music generally. Why, because it comes with a roughly 50 page booklet with photos that clarifies the writer's vision as well as the use of music throughout the show (including of course the various versions of the theme song).

So why only 4 stars for a 5 star show? The packaging, it is truly a crime, and I hope that whoever designed it and whoever approved of it are serving a life sentence as examples of poor product packaging design in universities around the world. Your DVD's will arrive tightly tucked in individual cardboard pockets. These pockets may or may not have survived the mailing process intact. Thus your DVD's may already have moved around the abrasive cardboard scratching them in the process. Four of mine were damaged as such and one DVD even had glue on the surface where it had come into contact with the split open cheaply glued seam of the cardboard pocket. And of course even if the DVD's arrive undamaged, you then have the challenge of removing them without scratching them. Trust me, easier said than done.

So in the end I highly recommend the show, and the music CD, but if you have the funds you may want to buy each season as the separate box set. Costing much more money (was that the goal?) but increasing significantly the odds that your DVD's will arrived undamaged. If you choose the all seasons set, good luck.

It's uncompromising, unflinching view of life for people in ""The Game"" resonates beyond the view of the people involved.  This is not a show you can or will want to watch while doing something else, its simply too detailed and finely crafted to miss a single moment.

The Wire was underappreciated during its run probably because of the subject matter but give it 3 episodes and you'll be hooked.

BUT, why did HBO have to ruin that with cheap packaging and full screen format. I'm sure that the could have put the DVD's in better packaging. The package it came in had a big UPS code flier thing glued to the back of the box and rips a layer off the box as you try to take it off. The DVD's are separated by seasons but are in bad cardboard holder that (could) scratch as you take out the disc. Also, I'm not sure how they divided up each season on to the disks... some have 2 episodes, others have 4, which I think was to the degradation of quality of the picture. It would also have been nice to have the show in wide screen, or in hi quality format.

That all being said, watch the show any way you can (have a friend burn you a copy or something... the quality would be the same)... Then wait if a better version comes out in the future.",1235260800,27,980,4.072538860103627

It also shows just how blurred the line between good and evil can become.

4847341,5,B005NFJAWG,"As far as this box set is concerned, the packaging is very compact and fits very easily on any bookshelf. It can be stored vertically to save space, or horizontally to show off as a mantelpiece. As far as the special features go, there aren't any on seasons 1 or 2 other than audio commentaries. I would've liked to see more documentary behind-the-scenes features which are seen on seasons 4 and 5. Those are absolutely phenomenal, bringing you into the world of The Wire, both as a TV show and as a mirror for the city of Baltimore. The special features on season 3 are very unique (Q&A panel of cast/crew from the Museum of Television and one David Simon guest lecture at a college), but I must admit they are somewhat boring.

However, all that aside, the quality of the show itself redeems any faults. The Wire is most truly appreciated when the series is watched from start to finish. As David Simon often says, the show is like a novel which should be evaluated based on the whole product (1 season) rather than indivudal chapters (1 episode). Each character will have you hooked as they embark on amazing emotional journeys throughout these five seasons. The show sugarcoats nothing, which is a quality that may alienate some viewers of more traditional, network television. In other words, there aren't very many ""happy endings."" The realism, arguably even pessimism, of the show is a never-before-seen social commentary on life in urban America.",1234396800,,1454,4.792828685258964

I was skeptical because most crime dramas have a short one hour story arc and the good guy gets the bad guy. That isn't what The Wire is about. I don't even think you can call it a crime drama or police drama. It is a microcosm of America. It doesn't fit any niche. It's just great writing about subjects obviously near and dear to the creators of the show. If you invest your time in this show you will be rewarded with entertainment, comedy, drama, and enlightenment. You'll laugh, you'll shake your head in disgust, you might even cry.
You won't see the stereotypical good guys and bad guys. You'll see human beings and all their flaws. You see cops doing good things and truly despicable things. You'll see bad guys doing bad things and find yourself rooting for them because you understand their motivation.

One note. The show never drags but you will find the each episode is a full hour and not a whole lot will happen (plot wise). I've never seen a show that can keep a person in its grip and move so deliberately.

4847364,5,B005NFJAWG,"Reflecting back on the five seasons of The Wire, HBO's critically acclaimed original series, I'm reminded of one central phrase:

""It's all connected.""

This mantra can arguably be claimed as the central, unifying theme throughout the series. While the stories changed, the general idea was still the fact that all of us must contend with the rules of our chosen occupation. And a seemingly insignificant detail can later become the key to an entire puzzle.

At its core, The Wire is classic storytelling. It bases each of its seasons upon one central theme, and then proceeds to examine it from the perspective of all groups involved. But it diverges from this blueprint by giving a remarkable amount of attention to its subjects, reaching a level of storytelling that is almost cinematic in scale. Others have referred to it as a multi-part film, and in many ways it is. Episodes still predominantly have three acts, but individually they flow into each other more so than most series; episodes also seldom tie up all loose ends or end happily. The viewer might feel initial shock at being treated so intelligently.

The Wire also differs from most shows of its type by richly characterizing all of its characters, not just the ones who wear a badge. Protagonists and antagonists don't exist in the conventional sense; for proof, look no further than de facto main character Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West). While few would argue that he is ""good police"" (in the words of his frequent partner, Bunk Moreland), he possesses an almost overwhelming disdain for his superiors, along with alcoholic and womanizing tendencies. The street characters are also portrayed as complex, very human individuals, with the character of Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), Baltimore's resident gay stick-up artist, being a standout.

The box set of The Wire includes all five seasons, presented in a compact, sleek package that will easily fit on almost any shelf. The special features are largely the same as on the individual season sets, with a couple of key exceptions. As such, I can't really recommend this set if you've being buying the seasons individually, but I wholeheartedly recommend it if you are new to the series or have been waiting to make a single purchase of all the seasons. (And more than likely you will want to see the conclusion once you've started.)

In short, The Wire is a true masterpiece, and will certainly be remembered as one of the best TV shows of this--or any--decade. Critically acclaimed, but criminally underseen, I can only hope that this set will reach far more viewers than premium cable ever could.",1231718400,6,2622,4.96127562642369

With that said, I'll join the chorus of people a little worried about the packaging. The set does indeed consist of cardboard sleeves. Though these cases are very slick and stylish, frequent use of them would likely cause damage to the business side of the DVDs. Soon, I fear, these discs may end up like my copy of ""There Will Be Blood"", which suffers a similar packaging plight. It's not all bad, though- it's a magnificent package, I'd say, considering alone that it manages to cram all 5 seasons and all 23 discs into a box not much larger than that of the original 1st season release, and look damned spiffy in the meanwhile.

I will note that upon first removal of the first season (which I absolutely must re-watch now that I've obtained the series at such a devilishly affordable price-tag), no scuffs or scratches are visible.

4847373,5,B005NFJAWG,"I do not suscribe to HBO. I have not watched an entire television series in over a decade. I find current and recent television to be incredibly cliche and boring. It is with that attitude that I finally caved in and bought all five seasons of The Wire. Several of my friends have been encouraging me for the past four or five years to find a way to watch this show. After seeing all the positive reviews, and getting a good price from Amazon I decided to give things a go.

Other people have done a nice job of detailing what the show is about, so I will refrain from doing that in this review. What I will say is that this is the rare show/movie that actually lives up to the hype and expectations for me. In fact, it surpasses them.

I got so hooked on this series that I knocked out an entire season every couple of days until I was finished with all seasons. This is addictive viewing to say the least! The acting is simply superb. The characters are generally well cast. There is humor, drama, action, suspense, etc. in each season. I honestly feel sorry for people that watched each season as they came out, episode by episode. I couldn't have stood the wait from week to week to see what happened next.

What I like best about this series is that the writing is so superb. It is smart, and while it may get a bit sensationalistic at times, it is grounded in reality and makes the viewer think that they are getting an actual window into observing the characters' lives. Additionally, there is none of the clear-cut good versus evil crap that saturates most shows and movies these days. In the Wire, the good guys are sometimes very bad, and the bad guys are sometimes very good. The characters are portrayed as being very human, with nobody being perfect. It is this intricacy in character development that helps make an already interesting story even better.

In closing, I highly recommend The Wire. This is coming from someone who is generally pretty cynical about television shows. There are very few shows, or movies for that matter, that have hooked me as much as The Wire.",1230940800,2,2087,4.469816272965879

It's great to watch a show that is as real as it can get.

I loved this show from the very first episode. The only concern I had with this show was that even though the writing was superb, it let me down all the way to the series finale. The first season started it all and was so suspenseful. After that, the show never reached that peak again. But, that's just my opinion. I still enjoyed every moment of this series no matter what flaws it had. It's hard to come across a show of this caliber where you can be watching a disappointing episode and still be intrigued.

I highly, HIGHLY, encourage you to purchase the entire season. This is very much the show that could have and should have promoted HBO. But again, that's just my opinion.",1230768000,2,1060,4.321608040201005
4847376,5,B005NFJAWG,"I'll blow through the review of the show, because enough people have gone into detail with their own reviews. The Wire is, quite simply, a masterpiece of television. Of any medium, really. It gets better with each season, and stands up to repeated viewings. It's also funny, a quality that is sorely under-reported in most reviews. There are legitimate, real laughs to be had throughout the program. You'll love it.

Amazon has two review categories for video games. The quality of the game, and how fun the game is. For DVDs, particularly with box sets like this becoming so popular, they should have ratings for the show and for the packaging. The packaging is good, it's attractive, it's not unnecessarily large like the Complete The Sopranos. But it's not great, either. The DVDs come in attractive cardboard sleeves, which is fine with me, but they aren't assembled very well. At least, mine wasn't. Fortunately, I don't keep the DVDs in the sleeves anyway, but, if I did, they would undoubtedly break after repeated use.

4847381,5,B005NFJAWG,"On the basis of previous reviews, you'd never know that this series was on the verge of being canceled at least twice, that it never made satisfactory numbers for HBO, or that it was almost universally ignored by award committees despite its fervid following.

There's a number of things for the faint-hearted or first time viewers to know about The Wire before you jump in:

1. There is no denouement, no simple, clear resolution at the end of every episode ala CSI, NCIS, or any other typical police drama. On the contrary, The Wire is the epitome of the ""slow build"", it takes episodes to get started, much less finished. As in life, there are rarely any easy, clear resolutions at the end. Unlike the black and white worlds of network tv, The Wire is all gray.

2. There is not a simple, single story line. Rather The Wire is characterized by complex, multiple story arcs that can extend over more than one season. It demands (and rewards) concentration, rather than escape. Redemption and revenge are possible, but not in one episode or one season. The Wire requires patience.

3. There are no clear cut heroes and villains (this is the anti-""Heroes"" tv show.) There are only human beings, all flawed. McNulty, a hero, is an alcoholic who cheats on his wife. Even Marlowe, the apparently soulless villain, grapples with very human issues of loyalty and pride.

4. Though there are great, fully realized characters (almost too many for escapist viewers to follow), and though to some degree Baltimore, the city, is a central character, the abiding presences in The Wire are Baltimore's institutions and organizations: courts, city government, educational system, labor unions, police, newspapers. Even gangs are seen as just another organization. Unlike any other show I've ever seen, The Wire demonstrates how institutions are built from a complex web of relationships and motivations and seem to have an existence independent of those who participate in them. And it does so in such a subtle way that it's not automatically obvious. It doesn't appear to be about institutions, but it is. That's subtlety.

That's only a start. There's more that makes The Wire a challenge for viewers: it's non-linearity (it's more like a spiral), it's bleak view of cities and urban institutions; the seeming randomness of so many events that impact lives, etc., etc., etc.

All that said, The Wire, for those willing to make the investment of time and attention, is a transcendent, moving experience. However downbeat it's subject matter, it is, in the end, a true work of art, a masterwork, and as such ultimately enobling and uplifting.  And just a thrill to watch.",1229990400,"2,102",2658,4.930648769574944
4847382,4,B005NFJAWG,"I'm not going to go into how great the show is - just check out the reviews on this or any other site and you'll get an idea of what to expect. This particular set, however, is a five star product in one star packaging. The DVDs are packaged in terrible cardboard sleeves, which will guarantee a few scratches even if you just take them out once and put them in a real case (which I recommend), and they'll eventually be rendered unplayable if you choose to continue to store them in the sleeves. There are also no great set-exclusive bonuses, as there were in other Complete Series sets, like Six Feet Under's soundtrack CD's and commemorative book, MASH's extra discs, or Homicide's (also by Wire creator David Simon) cool filing cabinet packaging and bonus Law and Order crossover episodes.

4847384,5,B005NFJAWG,"Forget Law & Order, C.S.I., NYPD Blue, and every single other cop or crime drama (except maybe for Homicide: Life on the Street) you've ever seen.  HBO's The Wire is single handedly the single best series, of any genre, that you have never seen, as well as being perhaps the most complex and well-written shows to ever grace television.  Created by Homicide: Life on the Street and The Corner creator David Simon, all five seasons of the The Wire are collected in this handsome box set, presenting the tales of the crime and drug-ridden Baltimore streets, as well as the dealers, cops, junkies, and everyone else caught in between.  Our main protagonist through the series is self-destructive detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), but he is only one of many, many unforgettable characters that have an impact on the events of the series, as well as each other, even if they don't know it.  From drug kingpins Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) and Stringer Bell (the smooth as silk Idris Elba), to the fearless vigilante Omar (Michael K. Williams), to junkie Bubbles (Andre Royo) to corrupt dock worker Frank Sobotka (Chris Bauer), to up and coming kingpin Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector), to would be mayor Tommy Carcetti (Aiden Gillen), to doomed youths Michael (Tristan Wilds) and Dukie (Jermaine Crawford); all of whom leave quite an impression on the viewer, and end up proving to be some unforgettable characters made greater by the actors playing them.  Sadly underappreciated during its run (how this show was only ever nominated for two Emmy's is beyond comprehension), The Wire can now be discovered and re-discovered for years to come.  After viewing one episode, you'll be quite intrigued, and after viewing the first season, you'll be hooked.  And most of all, you'll never be able to watch all those other crime dramas and cop shows in the same way ever again.

And I don't come up until the entire season is played out. Oh, I may go to work, do house chores, take care of my children and family, but I know I can come back to whereever I paused and pick up. Thank you, David Simon, for such an incredible story. Do I have a favorite character? In The Wire there is no such animal. Oh, there are characters who will always stay in my memory. And sometimes as I'm going along, I'll think of 'Snoop' and smile as I remember such an audacious person, or I'll think of 'Dookie' and feel a sense of sadness because of someone with so much promise but because of circumstances there is no chance for anything to be done. 'Brother Mouzon' the counterpart, adversary and equal of 'Omar,' full of dignity and a true believer in 'the code.' All the guys on the dock, living out their lives just trying to make it in this cruel world where even when you try to carve out your own little place, circumstances are set up to move your off your square. So what can you do just to show your mettle? 'Vote for a dead man.' David Simon, you took no short cuts. You didn't try to make it grimy and you didn't try to make it pretty.

Some have called it a novel for the small screen. I'd call it the most significant American cultural achievement of the decade.

There's no better way to watch it than this, either.  See 'em one at a time, or indulge yourself with a second or third. I think the final season (5) becomes a bit overwhelmed by the show's scope and didactic themes, but by then, you're just glad to have a little more time with these characters, more time cradled in the hands of the best television craftsmen ever: David Simon and Ed Burns.

4847393,5,B005NFJAWG,"I've been eagerly anticipating this boxed set for a while, because it wasn't until the beginning of the fifth season that I even knew The Wire existed. I got caught up with the story via TiVo, on demand, and my personal favorite, torrents, but I wanted to make sure this set would be worth buying. If I'm into a show enough to buy a set like this (and only two other shows have entered this pantheon: The (British) Office, and Six Feet Under), I want to make sure I don't miss any special features or extras that might be left out of this ""complete"" set. So I wanted to know if I should buy this, or if it would be a better value to just buy the stand-alone seasons individually. This review takes as read the fact that The Wire is the best show TV has ever produced, deserves six out of five stars, etc.

Well, it looks like this set is worth it. I don't have the bonus features of the individual boxed seasons to compare it with, but it looks like all the commentaries and bonus features of each season's release are included here. There are even a few extras not seen (on DVD) before, like the three short prequels to The Wire HBO did as promotional stuff for Season 5 (I believe its Young Prop Joe, Young Omar, and Rookie McNulty Meets Bunk), as well as a gag reel. This set might not contain absolutely everything ever made for or about The Wire, but it looks like this is as close it as you're gonna get, and you at least know you won't be missing out on anything if you buy this set (as opposed to buying all five seasons separately). I bought mine at Best Buy for the same price Amazon has listed, and it not only came with a 35-track bonus CD with music from all five seasons, but it also came with a 68 page booklet (haven't read it yet ... this is a Christmas present, after all).

It dives into topics such as homelessness, politics, intercity schools, family values, broken familys, drug abuse, drug recovery, police investigations, police curruption, and many more topics. This is simply a MUST-SEE show. It is not for everyone as it is extremly real and indepth. If you want a easy watching, simple minded show this is not for you.",1228694400,12,636,4.491379310344827

4847398,5,B005NFJAWG,"Watching ""The Wire"" is like reading a really good book --- complex, layered, fully-developed characters, fleshed-out storylines with narrative arcs, etc.  The show feels very true to life:  the good guys aren't always so good, and the bad guys aren't always all bad.  The legal system is corrupt, the police and newspaper organizations are more interested in appearances than truth, the drug war isn't really a war at all, the good guys don't always win and the bad guys don't always lose.

Season One primarily deals with a special police task force trying to take down Baltimore drug kingpin Avon Barksdale's organization. (The entire series is filmed and set in Baltimore, Maryland - ""bodymore murderland"").  Barksdale is an ""old school"" Baltimore gangster but his second in command, Stringer Bell, perhaps has his eyes set on greater heights for the organization than his boss will allow.  Many of the central characters we meet in this season will be featured in all five seasons.

Season Two primarily deals with another special task force investigating a local dockworker's union because a high-ranking Police department official has  a personal beef with a union official.  The police official orders the task force to ""find something, anything"" on the union official or the union.  Things are complicated by a few accidental deaths and the fact that the union official really is corrupt (to a degree unbeknownst to the police official) but he's doing all these corrupt things for the right reasons (sort of).

Season Three primarily deals with City Hall - corruption and backstabbing within the system, political maneuvering, a white candidate trying to unseat a black mayor in a mostly-black city, and important police investigations being compromised or shut down solely for political reasons.  Season three also sees the introduction of a new drug lord named Marlo Stanfield, a ruthless twenty-something sociopath with an elite team of enforcers backing him up.  You can't take your eyes off this guy.  He is deliciously evil but in the most understated way possible.

Season Four deals primarily with the school system, its ineffectiveness, the students' lifestyle obstacles that make learning difficult or impossible, how politics impedes progress in the schools, and the toll that poverty and crime takes on the lives and futures of the children.  The lives of some of the children become intertwined with the Stanfield organization.

Season Five deals primarily with the media.  An unprincipled but effective police detective manipulates crime scene evidence to fabricate a serial killer because it is the only way to get the city to pour financial resources into the police department, money he plans to use to pursue real cases he is driven to solve.  An ambitious but unprincipled reporter for The Baltimore Sun, who has a history of fabricating stories to pad his resume [based on high-profile real-life people and incidents], embellishes and fabricates elements of the story to further his career (not knowing the serial killer doesn't really exist).  His editor at the paper suspects  the reporter is turning in fraudulent stories, and when he takes his proof to management at the paper, management turns a deaf ear because they see their rising-star reporter as their ticket to a possible Nobel Prize for Public Service for the newspaper.  Layoffs and cutbacks at the newspaper further undermine the Sun's professional integrity.  ""Maybe you DO win the Nobel Prize"", says the editor who knows of the star reporter's fraudulent but popular news pieces, ""and maybe you have to give it back.""

About 2 dozen central characters run through all 5 seasons, including police detectives, drug lords, street-level dealers, city prosecutors, and one especially interesting criminal character who robs drug dealers for a living.  The drug lords are probably far and away the most interesting characters in the series.  They are magnetic, charismatic, and ruthless, but perhaps no more ruthless than the red-tape and internal politics in the police department and City Hall.  Upon close examination, there really is very little difference between the business practices in the drug trade and the politics of City Hall and the Police Department.  The detectives in the Organized Crime Unit who really can devote time, energy, and resources to investigating the drug trade do so with no small sense of respect and admiration for their targets.

""The Wire"" is far and away the best drama I have ever seen on television.  Best part is, it doesn't feel like a TV show.  Few of the trademark TV elements are there:  no ""bumper music "" when a scenes change, no overly expository dialogue, no stand-alone episodes where a single case gets introduced and wrapped up in the same episode, and the episode structure is different than on network TV.  On commercial network TV dramas there are carefully placed dramatic ""beats"" that are positioned right before the show cuts to commercial.  It makes the rhythm of the shows fairly predictable.  Even when watching those episodes on DVD you can sense that.  But each episode of ""The Wire"" runs a full hour with no commercial interruptions and no predictable narrative or dramatic beats.  You get to watch things unfold as the storyline logic dictates, as opposed to how a 48-minute commercial TV episode would have to unfold under time constraints.

Needless to say, I highly recommend this show.  Bear in mind there is considerable adult language and some violence.  The language is so specific to the geography, professions, and cultures that one pretty much HAS to watch it with the English subtitles on in order to fully comprehend everything.  It may seem distracting at times but it definitely enhances the viewing experience.  I have watched the complete series 3 times in just under a year.  It is not unlike reading the same great novel over and over.  It might even be too good.  In the world of everyday television,  ""The Wire"" is Michael Jordan playing basketball against an elementary school team.  It's Rembrandt or Michelangelo against a bunch of fingerpainters. It's Charles Dickens against a bunch of pop-up books.  It's a game of chess versus a game of Go Fish.  It's a steak dinner against a box of McNuggets.  There's just no contest.

""The Wire"" could well change the way you watch TV.  It sets the bar so high you may never look at ""regular"" TV the same way again.  Once you see how great television drama CAN be, everything else just pales in comparison.  You'll want to revisit it over and over again.",1228003200,3,6571,5.057620817843866

8480434,2,B005NFJAWG,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? It is truly one of the greatest television series of all time, it totally lives up to the hype and is a landmark television achievement. Even compared to other excellent shows like the Sopranos, Oz or Boardwalk Empire, the Wire blows them all away and features a much greater degree of realism. I am not giving this review based on the quality of the show, that speaks for itself and you can find much more in depth reviews elsewhere. If I were reviewing the series itself, without question I would give it five stars. Although you should be aware this show is not for fans of things like Tranformers or Michael Bay movies. This show is hyper-intelligent and features a powerful commentary on todays society; crime, law enforcement, politics, the educational system, social and racial injustice along with virtually every other aspect of our modern world. This is not a show that features many happy endings and is probably the most realistic show ever produced. My review of the show is a solid A+ or 5 out of 5 stars.

However, as many other reviews have mentioned, this is the worst packaging I have ever encountered in all of my years collecting movies and television shows on DVD and Blu Ray. It is even worse considering the inflated price. For a show to cost upwards of $150, the least HBO could do is give you a product that will withstand the test of time. What you will receive is a nice LOOKING box set. It is an efficient use of space and takes up way less space than the individual seasons. However upon opening it, you will be immediately disappointed. Instead of plastic cases for the individual seasons, there are thin, flimsy cardboard holders that contain the discs. What holds the discs is even worse; each disc is held by the thinnest plastic sleeve I have ever seen. It is about 4 times thinner than a plastic grocery bag and like 8 times thinner than a ziplock bag. Even if you take remarkable care of each disc, like I have, these will begin to rip and tear almost immediately. This collection must have cost literal cents to produce. The cheapness of the packaging cannot be understated. So even if you take excellent care of the discs, they will begin getting scratched and worn just from the packaging!  In fact, you could receive them brand new with damage already sustained just from the packaging and/or shipping.  Normally I wouldnt dennounce a products packaging so much, especially considering this is perhaps my favorite show of all time. But I feel like HBO should have offered some sort of replacement/recall for this abysmal packaging issue.

It appears that they HAVE fixed this problem for the Blu-ray collection as well as newer DVD sets. But buyer beware; if you are purchasing the older, mid-2000s version of this box set, you should know just how subpar the packaging is. I would recommend contacting the seller to find out what version you will receive. Even then they will mostly likely not know the details of the contents if the box set is still sealed. You may want to consider the individual seasons as the packaging is far more sturdy and secure and you will end up spending less money.
Short review; one of the best shows ever put on television but the packaging will not last long and could end up doing permanent damage to the discs.",1529020800,,3347,4.639123102866779
