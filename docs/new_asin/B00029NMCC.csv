2072847,5,B00029NMCC,"The tablature booklet alone is worth the price of  admission.  Where else can you find these songs tabbed out like this?  This is definitely for intermediate to advanced players.
I was able to learn most the songs quickly, but a couple of them are killers!  When Buster is having to concentrate on the video, you know its gotta be hard to play.",1265414400,5,344,4.5
2072848,3,B00029NMCC,"Buster B. Jones nailed Jerry Reeds' style better than anyone I've seen.  However in true Buster style, he just can't seem to slow down enough for me to learn what he's playing without watching it over and over and over.  This product is definitely not for beginners, and challenging even for intermediate players.
I don't regret buying the DVD but it's not as easy to learn from as I'd hoped.",1257897600,7,392,4.585714285714285
8024817,5,B00029NMCC,Great guitar player. Tabs are on DVD. I had to use them to see what notes to play but by whatching video he shows technic which makes it easier. You still have to practice to get better. Excellent teacher,1505606400,,204,4.256410256410256
8024818,5,B00029NMCC,"Fantastic playing taught by the late Buster Jones
The PDF file in the back of the DVD with tab for all songs was extremely useful also
Tough to play but well worth the effort",1501632000,,174,4.147058823529412

8024820,5,B00029NMCC,"Outstanding video and tab booklet.  DO NOT PANIC because you see NO BOOKLET ( I already panicked for you).  This is 2014.  Books are electronic.  Put the DVD into your computer and copy the PDF file off of it.  Yeah, that took a few minutes to figure out.

Buster B. Jones is outstanding.  The video of Buster playing the songs and explaining them is absolutely top rate.

Update:  I find myself just putting the DVD in to listen to Buster play.  It is that good.",1413504000,,463,4.341176470588235
8024821,1,B00029NMCC,"recieved this  DVD 3/1/14  It is supposed to come with a 42 page booklet  of the music "" tabbed "" out.  there was no booklet with the DVD.  I called customer service. and they fast mailed me a second DVD, 3/7/14  This one also had the TAB booklet MISSING. This is a great DVD but without the tabuliture  it is pretty much useless as a learning tool. .  One of the 5 star ratings praises the booklet of tab claiming "" The book of tab alone  is worth the the price of the DVD"".  I would advise that no one orders this DVD until Amazon makes a statement declaring  that the problem has been cleared up.",1394150400,,599,4.077586206896552
8024822,2,B00029NMCC,this is the 2nd time I have ordered this dvd and it is the 2nd time I have received it without the music booklet. the dvd  itself is good but it does say on the back of the disk package that there is a 44 page tab music booklit included. there was no booklit with either package.,1360972800,3,279,3.8947368421052633
8024823,5,B00029NMCC,I have collected all of Buster B. Jones' Instructional DVDs! He was an excellent player! This one is amust for any serious collector.,1356220800,,133,4.826086956521739
8024824,5,B00029NMCC,"Buster makes it look easy, but trust me its not. There is some challenging material here especially Jerry's Breakdown. Don't know if I'll ever get that one up to speed. He breaks down the individual parts of each song and plays an up to speed version and a really slow version. I think Buster was a great player and teacher and his love and respect for Jerry Reeds music is evident. Unfortunately Buster is no longer with us but he left a few dvds to teach us and I hope to try some of his other ones. This is probably for intermediate to advanced players, it might be a little difficult for beginners!!!",1337472000,2,604,4.353982300884955
8024825,5,B00029NMCC,Buster does an excellent job detailing the complexities of Jerry's style. Easy to follow and really packed with information. Jerry was a one-of-a-kind writer/player and players from all genres will find something new on this DVD.,1287705600,3,229,5.388888888888889
8024826,5,B00029NMCC,"If you ever wanted to know more about guitar playing and Jerry Reed style was your subject...this is the DVD to buy. Buster B is a master. Not only a master guitarist but an extremely masterful teacher. Just watching him play and listening to him speak, you get the feeling that you really want to know him in real life! Too bad he's gone, but boy...what a player!",1268524800,3,364,4.367647058823529
