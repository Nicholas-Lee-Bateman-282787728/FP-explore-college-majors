8430015,5,B0012WTTES,"I like the music, And how they have done this animating, The old fashioned way! Only 4 episodes on this disk, I got sent 2 of the first entire season, Maybe I'll sell the extra",1375401600,,176,4.057142857142857
8430016,5,B0012WTTES,"This disc has 4 episodes that are NOT on the Volume 1 box set of the series. As far as I know there will never be a volume 2. Sadly Fox Network killed the series before the story arc was finished. These episodes are enjoyable and fit in well with the rest of the series. There is a running subplot thru the whole series about a secret war between two factions of alien vampires at war with each other, and a leader of the good guys who can't be trusted. The ultrasecret Global Alliance is a group formed to protect the earth from these aliens that have lived on Earth for hundreds of years, while trying to keep it all a secret. In the meantime earthbased creatures such as banshees, the Abominable Snowman, and others appear in certain stories, often as good guys. Great animation, characters, and stories. The box set of 20 episodes is really nice, just search for ""Roswell Conspiracies Aliens, Myths & Legends Vol 1"", right here at Amazon.",1293667200,3,942,4.482558139534884
