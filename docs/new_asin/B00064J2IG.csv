2168043,4,B00064J2IG,"This movie is way looooong over due to be put on DVD. I find it amazing how some of the crapiest movies get released on DVD, yet this wonderful gem of a movie has yet to see the light of day on DVD. So please, please, please release this movie soon on DVD.",1269648000,17,256,3.849056603773585

2168046,1,B00064J2IG,It was off center of the screen; it has portions that the mouths moving did not coincide with the sound of the movie. I was so excited to get this movie and was disappointed in it. It was blurry during parts of if for no apparent reason. I won't trust this person again to buy from. The movie had no warnings of not copying; no usual ads regarding who was in it or the directors or any information I am used to having. I fear this was pirated.,1444694400,5,443,4.045454545454546

2168049,3,B00064J2IG,"This product was very cheaply made and the color quality is poor.  There are no comments, interviews, previews, or other usual content on this disc - just the movie.  However, the disc plays normally without any problem and is the originally released story.",1442188800,,257,4.953488372093023
2168050,5,B00064J2IG,"Great movie! Great acting! Saw it first run at age 9 with my mother on a Thursday evening (since it is an historic movie, I got permission to count it as ""homework""). This print is medium quality, however, so I hope for a BluRay restoration some day.",1441411200,,250,4.340425531914893

2168055,5,B00064J2IG,"I have always loved this movie since I was a little girl.  They hardly ever show this on TV anymore and couldn't wait to sit down and enjoy this movie. The  story is so unique and, although this is a novel, the facts about the Civil war are right on.  I will be watching this over and over again!!!",1438646400,,298,4.016949152542373
2168056,1,B00064J2IG,"The quality of the disc was so bad I stopped watching the movie.  The sound was off, and the picture quality was fuzzy at best.  Normally older movies get remastered and have that new movie look.  I want4ed to see this movie and enjoy it.  Hopefully  a better quality DVD will be available in the future.",1438473600,8,304,4.357142857142857
2168057,5,B00064J2IG,An amazing story of the love and devotion of a man for his wife that overlaid the background story of the love and devotion of the woman who lost the man to the other woman that he married.  A story that touched upon the intimate relationships sometimes formed between slaves and their owners and the loving relations between the slaves and the owners children.  A long movie well able to hold your attention.,1436832000,2,409,4.589041095890411
2168058,5,B00064J2IG,"For it's time, quite 'sweeping'  and beautiful in production style...Wonderful music, too.  AND, who could NOT love Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and the 'still-kicking' Eva Marie Saint!  Fond memories of my youth-viewing renewed with the DVD!!",1433980800,4,250,5.888888888888889
2168059,1,B00064J2IG,"The print is bad.  It looks like a bootleg copy.  You can still see it, but it's fairly blurry and seems to be in the wrong aspect ratio.  Maybe I will give it another look if it's properly restored.  That being said, restoration cannot do anything about what a tedious, thundering bore this film is.  Elizabeth Taylor gives a decent performance, despite the hackneyed plot.  Montgomery Clift went through many problems while filming including a near-fatal car crash and his performance suffers as a result.  The film is terrible in almost every way.",1433030400,8,550,4.849462365591398
2168060,3,B00064J2IG,"I really like the film.  The problem is the quality of the print.  If you are reading this, you are probably having the same issues with getting a quality dvd or blu-ray.  If you want this film for your collection and do not want a VHS or laser disc then you may want to consider this copy.  It was pretty poor quality, but at least we can see the film.",1431734400,10,353,4.0
2168061,4,B00064J2IG,"I agree with the other writers pleading for a quality American-released DVD version of ""Raintree County"" from MGM. What is the problem here? ""Raintree County,"" though not a perfect film and much troubled with Monty Clift's severe injuries during the production, is one of Miss Taylor's most important films. It represents one of five films for which she received an Oscar nomination with two wins (""Butterfield 8"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""). It would seem a fitting tribute for MGM and to Miss Taylor's life and career to release a quality DVD version.  There would certainly be a market from the actress's devotees for the DVD given that the other four films for which she was nominated as best actress are available on DVD.",1326585600,,737,4.896
2168062,5,B00064J2IG,"Also have been waiting a long long long time for this movie to be released on DVD!
So, Warner, what's the delay?",1317859200,,112,4.136363636363637
2168063,5,B00064J2IG,"With the passing of Elizabeth Taylor, along with her went just about the last of the great beauties of the 40's/50's. She made some wonderful movies in her career and this is one of them. She and Montgomery Clift were lifelong friends, and you can see the aura of their love for one another in this film. Eva Marie Saint, is also marvelous and quite a beauty too. The scenery, story, editting, and music are highly enjoyable - you will love it!  I hope it is released on DVD soon!",1308960000,,480,4.333333333333333
8038542,5,B00064J2IG,"""Raintree County"" is a romantic depiction of life during the Civil War era. This film allows character development that lacks in its sister film ""Gone With The WInd."" Cliff Montgomery is the handsome, charming gentlemen that will captivate the audience. He is kind, gentle, sensitive and conscientious. It is fascinating to see the situation played out of the marriage of an Abolitionist to a Southern Belle. The characters are very likable, and you know enough about them to care. The pace of the movie is excellent for nearly three hours long. The Technicolor is gorgeous. One will enjoy the psychological analysis of Elizabeth Taylor's character that is well written and executed. The musical score is splendid; I did not fast forward through the intermission because I loved the musical score. I recommend as one of the best Civil War Epics to be watched. :-)",1504310400,,863,5.0
