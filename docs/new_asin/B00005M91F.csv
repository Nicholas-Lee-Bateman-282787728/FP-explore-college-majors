1624479,2,B00005M91F,"While I am a huge fan of the Farscape series, I will not be buying any more of the DVDs until they start putting more goodies on them, or putting more episodes on them.  The first 2 DVDs of this series were great: actor profiles, alternate commentary tracks, storyboards, photos.  I just got number #4, and it had no commentary, and over half of the D'Argo profile was compiled from things we have seen in the previous DVDs!  Aaarrgh!
  Other series are putting 3-6 episodes on each DVD, but we are paying the same price for only 2 episodes.  Granted, the episodes are great, but that is no excuse to pilfer the pockets of the loyal fan base.  Let sci-fi.com know that we want more goodies, and perhaps with enough feedback, we can get them.  :)",996451200,21,745,4.426470588235294
1624480,5,B00005M91F,This DVD contains two episodes of the Satern Award Winning Show!  'Till the BLood Runs Clear' has very significant characterization.  Friends are made and bonds created! Lots of action.  And the music is totally AWSOME!! 'Rhapsody in Blue' is very artistic and beautifully made! It's a soft and heart warming episode! You find out who your friends are!,994118400,3,352,5.0344827586206895
1624481,5,B00005M91F,"If you've ever seen Farscape, then you have yet to see till the blood runs clear and rhapsody in blue.
Till the blood runs clear is where Crichton and Aeryn are forced to land Farscape One Module on the planet Dam-Ba-Da after it suffers a plasma leak during a failed experiment to create wormholes. While there, they notice a Peacekeeper Beacon broadcasting rewards for the capture of D'Argo, Zhaan and Rygel. A pair of bounty hunters also take notice of the broadcast, forcing Crichton to impersonate a bounty hunter himself in order to ensure the safety of the others.
Rhapsody in blue is about the entire crew who experience strange and powerful dreams. Moya, imagining the distress cries of a pregnant Leviathan, starbursts without warning in search of the call. Moya and the crew discover it is not a ship but a small colony of Delvian missionaries who followed their leader into the Uncharted Territories. The become distracted by powerful hallucinations of their pasts, activated by the mind control of the missionaries.
To keep you on the edge of your seat, I can speak no more of these 2 great episodes. All I can say is, you WILL enjoy them. If you're not a Farscape fan, you will be after viewing these episodes.",993686400,12,1223,4.746478873239437
7945151,5,B00005M91F,I have all the Dvd's. Farscape was an excellent show that I missed first time around. Now I get to enjoy it whenever I want.,1386720000,,124,4.0
7945152,5,B00005M91F,"I really got into Farscape through Netflix. I decided to buy this dvd because it is no longer up. My single favorite part of the show is the blue/orange moraliy undercurrent. Also, I like how the non-human people act just like human people.",1362268800,,240,4.604651162790698
7945153,5,B00005M91F,"Farscape, Right up there with Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica and many others is one of the best Science Fiction television shows to come along.  It lasted for 4 seasons and was such a fan hit that due to fan pressure a movie had to be made to tie all the ends up.  An achievement rarely seen.  I would recommend this to any and all.  Truly great television.",1243382400,,358,4.298507462686567
7945154,3,B00005M91F,"Sounds like a song.  While I do love these two episodes, with new planets, new characters, new aliens, the DVD itself has very little in it to be happy about.  And with only TWO episodes, even at a normal, new price they cost too much.  Now at the prices these USED DVDs are being sold for you have to ask yourself, is it worth it?",1203811200,,331,4.061538461538461
7945155,4,B00005M91F,"In ""Til the Blood Runs Clear,"" our heroes become involved with bounty hunters while having repairs made on Crichton's module.  There is some good interaction between Crichton and D'Argo, and there are some characters and plot points introduced here that will pay off in a big way many episodes from now.  In ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" we meet a group of Delvian dissidents with an unscrupulous leader who is not above deceiving Zhaan and playing with the memories of the other Moya crewmembers in order to get what she wants.  Two good solid episodes.",1107648000,,544,4.827956989247312
7945156,4,B00005M91F,"One of the things that the FARSCAPE tv series does so well is explore the boundaries of television science fiction and take on the task of giving their stories interesting turns and twists of both plot and characterisation.  The sixth DVD disc of the first season is no exception to this rule.
The first episode on this disc is ""Till the Blood Runs Clear.""  In the story, Crichton and Aeryn, while out researching wormholes, are forced to land on the desert world of Dam-Ba-Da, and seek the help of the mechanic Furlow to repair Farscape 1.  They discover that there are warning beacons out on the characters now, and Crichton and Aeryn are forced to pretend to be a pair of bounty hunters when they encounter two Vorcarians, seeking the rewards for the fugitives.  Complicating matters are Zhaan's reaction to the solar flares in the area, and D'Argo's impatience with Crichton and his arrival on the planet - only to be captured by the bounty hunters, and putting Crichton in a dangerous position.  This is a terrific episode that focuses on Crichton and Aeryn, and leads to some interesting revelations as Crichton and D'Argo come to a mutual understanding about their relationship.  The extras here provide some interesting depth to the characters, and make some of the storyline a bit clearer.  One terrific episode, that owes a lot to some of the sf movies that have been out there for a while.
""Rhapsody in Blue"", the second offering on the DVD, is a story in which the strange dreams about past loves that Moya's crew have, coupled with Moya's own Starbursting in response to another pregnant Leviathan, leads the crew into the clutches of a group of renegade Delvians led by one Tahleen.  She wants to learn the secrets that Zhaan possesses that prevent Zhaan from succumbing to her ""dark impulses,"" but when Zhaan offers to show her the means in Unty, a Delvian form of joining of two spirits/souls, Tahleen takes the extra step and *steals* the knowledge from Zhaan.  With the rest of the crew being disrupted by the other Delvians' manipulating their worst fears and desires, it's up to Crichton to show Zhaan the path back to her loveable self.  A superb episode that sheds light on the Delvian Seek, on Zhaan's crime, and on the love of John Crichton's life.  It has some interesting ramifications for the future, and sees several changes in the personalities of Moya's crew.  The extra footage here enhances elements of the ""Delvian experience"", but isn't a necessity.
Like the previous DVDs in the series, the sixth DVD of FARSCAPE's first season has the commercials ads at the beginning... but the episodes presented and the sheer quality of both sound and picture are abso-frelling superb.  While the extras on this DVD are once more pretty skimpy - presenting a Profile on Moya, Pilot, and the folks who bring these beings to life - the reason for the lack of extras on the last few DVDs has been explained as a licensing problem (one that has been cleared up, and will see other features once more, such as the commentary versions of the episodes on the DVDs, on them from the eleventh DVD on).  That doesn't mitigate the cost of the DVDs however, as these are quite expensive, but FARSCAPE is a series well worth owning on DVD.  Overall, ""Till the Blood Runs Clear"" and ""Rhapsody in Blue"" are terrific episodes of FARSCAPE that emphasize the true boundaries to which sf can be pushed, but the lack of extras make the DVDs not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.",1015372800,6,3481,4.730578512396694
7945157,5,B00005M91F,Finally we have a Science Fiction show for the future. I enjoy how all the character seem to melt together. They are all easy to watch. The story line is simple and does not try to convince you that it is all possible. I also like the fact that each one of the characters have a weakness and the others back that characters weakness with a strength. I hope this show last for another 10 years.,1013472000,2,393,4.184210526315789
7945158,5,B00005M91F,"This whole series is spectacular - words do not do it justice, you need to see it for yourself.  If you like SciFi that is smart, witty, funny, exciting, scary, etc. and will make you think - then this series is definitely for you.  Try it!",1003104000,,240,4.195652173913044
7945159,5,B00005M91F,"I enjoyed this dvd like I have enjoyed the other ones. I really enjoyed ''Till the Blood runs Clear'' it shows John finding the beginnings of a wormhole and what that does to his module. The Aeryn-John relationship progresses some as well. Plus,D'Argo and John come to an understanding with one another. This episode also forshadowed some things in season 3 which I found to be interesting .
''Rhapsody in Blue'' was also a interesting episode for it showed some more delvians and more of Zhaan's past and why she is a prisoner on Moya. John we see has had a long-term relationship with a woman named Alex who he almost had proposed to which I found to be interesting thing to know as well. But I am a fan of the John-Aeryn relationship so I am glad he is in the UT with everyone on Moya. These two episodes showcase how far the characters have come in the short time the show had been on at this point. It is half way through season 1 and it has been One helluva ride!",1000339200,5,969,4.300546448087432
7945160,1,B00005M91F,Aside from the value not being great there is the fact that early episodes from the 3rd season are already avail in the UK. We haven't even seen a completed 1st season! P.S. I think the extras were axed so that the distributer could include more advertising for their other products.,998956800,5,283,4.568627450980392
