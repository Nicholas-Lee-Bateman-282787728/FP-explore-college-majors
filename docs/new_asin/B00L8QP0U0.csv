6474561,4,B00L8QP0U0,"After working my way through the Frankenstein Complete Legacy Collection which was all sorts of fantastic I made my way to and through the Mummy. The original Boris Karloff The Mummy surprised me because there was so little of the titular ragged specimen in the film, Karloffs Im-Ho-Tep doffing his bandages soon after being revived, and menacing the 1930s in cultish fashion versus overpowering people. The make-up was fantastic in this too short film. The sequel The Mummys Hand may be what more people like myself remember and transcribe onto the original feature as, aside from the Abbott and Costello routine of the two protagonist fortune seekers, there is much of the wrapped rascal stiffly rambling about and choking people to do. The flashing black eyes of the mummy were sinister indeed and also caught me for a surprise. While I appreciate the first feature, The Mummys Hand is my favorite Universal Mummy movie. The following sequels leave a bit to be desired as they trade the traditional Egyptian sand and stone sanctuary trappings for the farmlands of the east coast and middle America. While there is plenty of mummy monster action in the sequels that follow (The Mummys Tomb, The Mummys Curse, and The Mummys Ghost all of which have a lot of stock footage to boot) the transcription of Kharis to middle America farmlands loses mystery and creates a sort of dissonance; the mummy is out of place shambling around American corn fields, the exotic aspect of the creature is lost. But these are still fun movies and the Blu-ray presentation is crisp and clear even in the darker scenes. For the value this set is 5 stars, but for the movies themselves as entertainment, perhaps 4 stars. And lest we forget Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy this fun film which ends up throwing a lot of mummys at us by films end doesnt rely on a gaggle of different monsters to sell the story. That is both to its benefit and its detriment but Im glad they included it!",1512864000,,1965,4.7317784256559765

6474579,4,B00L8QP0U0,"Universal surprisingly released two new monster collections to blu ray well before October this year, With Dracula and The Mummy collections done and the Frankenstein and Wolfman sets released last year the remaining classic monsters Creature from the Black Lagoon and Invisible Man sets are sure to follow.

The Mummy set may be the best one yet not so much for the group of movies quality, but because we only get 1 double dip in this set. The original Mummy starring Boris Karloff is by far the best film on this set and the first disc features that film along with all of the bonus material (except trailers for the individual films on the other discs). The Mummy remains the best mummy film ever made and Jack Pierce's make up design is unsurpassed to this day. Karloff was still very thin at this time and his emaciated body only makes this creature look all the more authentic.

Disc two features The Mummy's Hand and The Mummy's Tomb. Both films like great in high def showing impressive detail, the sound is also improved. The films themselves are kind of silly, but for monster kids who grew watching these films they are still very entertaining. The Mummy's Hand runs 1 hour and 6 minutes so the brisk pace works well for these types of films. Tom Tyler plays the mummy in this film, but Lon Chaney Jr. takes over the role for the next three films until the series ended. The Mummy's Hand has a little too much comedy for my taste, but overall it is fun and we get to see a lot more of the mummy compared to the original where the actual mummy is only on screen for a few seconds. The second film on disc two is The Mummy's Tomb which runs an hour, actually less if you consider the first 12 minutes are mostly stock footage from the previous film and Steve Banning tells the tale of the mummy thirty years later in the intro to this film. Funny note, Banning tells how the mummy kills certain people in the last film, but he was not present when they were murdered and no one else is alive to tell about it.  It's just one of those little things that makes me chuckle. Chaney is unrecognizable under the make up which looks good but it's huge down grade from the original 1932 film. Trailers for each film are also included on this disc and that is it.

Disc three holds The Mummy's Ghost and The Mummy's Curse both film look great. The films are pretty redundant having the same basic plot, but all four of these films are fun for those of us who grew up with them The Mummy's Ghost is one of my favorite of this series, I like the ending with the mummy and the princess sinking to the bottom of the swamp with the princess aging back to mummy form as she goes down under the water. The Mummy's Curse is more of them same but a continuity issue really has you scratching your head on this one. In the previous two films the location of the mayhem takes place in Massachusetts, so when the mummy and princess sink in the swamp there it is mind numbing when the princess (now young and beautiful again) rises out of the mud in Louisiana? It's all good fun though and as a kid I loved this series probably because the films were short and showed the mummy through the majority of the films. Trailers are the only extras on the disc.

Disc four holds Abbott & Costello Meet The Mummy and while I love most of the comedy teams monster films this one is a little too long in the tooth and we don't  get any horror comedy action until the last 20 minutes or so. The film runs close to 80 minutes which feels long. It's great that they included it and for the $24 I paid for this set I am very pleased with the upgrade.

The case is familiar looking, but it is a nice package, no sleeves, we get hubs and no disc stacking either. The films all look and sound great so there really isn't much to complain about other than it would have been nice to get commentaries for the new films to blu ray as I'm sure fans would have enjoyed hearing stories regarding the making of these fun minor classics.",1507075200,2,4000,4.3111702127659575

6474584,5,B00L8QP0U0,"I have had this for several months but for several reasons have watched it until last week.

Having watched the first 3 movies of this set it is simply astounding how good the picture is. Even on my 75 inch Samsung 4k set the detail are hard to believe. Like another reviewer said - it's had to believe how many shades of gray there are! The picture looks brand new and was at LEAST as good as when it was first released - it's amazing considering the movies are close to 75 years old.

I loved the first one with Karloff as the mummy/Ardath Bey - I did feel the story need a little something.

The second one (Mummy's Hand) would have been better without much of the comedy/lighter bits IMHO but ended up being pretty good overall.

The 3rd movie (Mummy's Tomb) was better and continued the story from Mummy's Hand - it was nice to meet up with the characters from the 2nd movie even though the 2 main ones ended up dead. I would have liked to the girlfriend/wife from the 2nd movie but they did mention her saying she had died. I actually thought this was better than 'Hand'. However both Hand and Tomb needed a longer running time as both were barely 60 minutes. I think both would have benefited from another 10 or 15 minutes (or even 20 minutes!) of run time.

I will post more in a few days after watching the last 2 movies.",1505606400,,1330,4.261904761904762

That's certainly not a criticism. It was different time. Abbott and Costello meet the Mummy is the kind of stupid humor they are known for. ""The shovels my pick"". The Mummy with Boris Karloff is far better than the rest of the mummy series. It's a great movie night.

I hope when they get to the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" series they include the 3-D versions of the first two.
The ""Mummy"" is one of my favorite Universal ""Monster"" films.  Very atmospheric and well acted.  Jack Pierce's make-up for Karloff was great and the walking mummy with supernatural powers is actually scary.
All the other ""Mummy"" films to follow are basically the same plot over and over with the mummy shuffling along dragging bandages, not scary.  Although he has to drag one foot no one seems to be able to outrun him.  He also has one arm the seems to be immobilized yet he manages to pick up a fainted lady and then climb up rose trellises with her in tow.  He gets burned up several times but comes back from the ashes.  He sinks in a swamp in the Northeast and come out of a swamp in Louisiana.  His name changes, as does that of the sect of high priests, but I guess that is to protect the innocent :-).  The first Kharis picture takes place in the 1940s and the second is supposed to be 30 years later making it the 1970s??????  Silly pictures but worth a watch.",1503273600,,1259,4.439130434782609
6474604,5,B00L8QP0U0,"Finally, the classic mummy movies have been restored to pristine quality. Yes, some may say that after the original with Boris Karloff they kind of went down hill. Even so, these are classics and they are great to watch for any fan of the classic monsters. These now have a clear, crisp picture and cleaned up sound. If you have seen the 100th anniversary Universal release of The Mummy then you have a preview of the quality.

The extras are somewhat lacking and the trailers - not remastered - are in DVD quality. But it's the movies you want to purchase this set for. Also, I was surprised to see Abbott and Costello Meet The Mummy in 16x9 format. Nice!",1503187200,,656,4.466666666666667

6474654,5,B00L8QP0U0,"""The Mummy"" (1932), possibly my favorite of all the classic Universal monster films, looks and sounds as amazing here as it did when they first restored it a couple years ago for the Essentials Collection.

Binged all six movies the night I got this set, and am thrilled with the amount of respect and care all five sequels have received for their Blu-ray debut. Most of them were a bit inconsistent technically when they were made, so there will always be the odd shot that isn't quite in focus, and stock footage from the first two films looks slightly shabbier each time it's recycled. Absent all that, the images consistently range from very good to breathtaking---more often the latter than the former, in fact. Grayscales are gorgeous; blacks, in the many moments of haunting chiaroscuro lighting, are inky-deep. In medium shots---at least in ""Hand"" and ""Ghost,"" perhaps the two standouts in terms of crispness---one can almost count the threads of characters' jackets or the hair follicles on their faces. Details of Jack Pierce's mummy makeup come through brilliantly. Grain is generally stable and pleasing. It gets coarse on occasion, but rarely detrimentally so. Even ""Curse,"" arguably the cheapest-looking of the bunch (though a personal favorite), looks outstanding.

Sound is generally excellent, dialogue easily understood---even in the original, which, if you grew up watching these movies on TV or VHS in the '80s or '90s, is saying something.

I did note quite a bit of ""blooming"" around characters or objects moving quickly against backgrounds of different light intensity. However, some or perhaps most of that probably has to do with sub-optimal settings on my large LED screen. In any case, it's generally fleeting and never, for me, became a significant distraction.

""A & C Meet the Mummy"" benefits from its original widescreen aspect ratio, here represented for the first time on home video.

In sum, I can't recommend the set highly enough for fans. Thank you, Universal! Now, about those ""Invisible Man"" and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" sets...",1495411200,11,2075,5.127218934911243

6474658,5,B00L8QP0U0,"Back in 2014 Universal issued the ""Classic Monsters Complete 30 Film Legacy Collection"" DVD mega-box.
ALL the Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Invisible Man and Wolf Man movies produced by Universal in the 1930s and '40s, plus some stragglers from the 1950s.
Individual multi-disc boxes were also issued for each monster.
Now Universal is gradually re-releasing these ""Legacy Collection"" boxes on Blu-Ray with improved black & white pictures.
Its amazing how many shades of gray those old negatives had.
Quite beautiful pictures.
No new extras on Blu-Ray, but all the extras from DVD have been carried over:
Commentary tracks, bonus features, and English SDH subtitles.

Boris Karloff is best remembered as the Frankenstein monster (1931), but the following year Universal also cast him in the first Mummy film.
Karloff appeared in two sequels to Frankenstein (1935 & 1939), but he never again played the Mummy.*
The Mummy franchise was never as popular with the public as Frankenstein, Dracula or the Wolf Man.
The Mummy had to wait eight years for the first sequel, and
Universal couldn't even get the character's name straight: Imhotep, Kharis or Klaris?

-- 1932: ""The Mummy"" - Boris Karloff as Imhotep
-- 1940: ""The Mummy's Hand"" - Tom Tyler as Kharis (introduction of tana leaves)
-- 1942: ""The Mummy's Tomb"" - Lon Chaney Jr. as Kharis
-- 1944: ""The Mummy's Ghost"" - Lon Chaney Jr. as Kharis
-- 1944: ""The Mummy's Curse"" - Lon Chaney Jr. as Kharis
-- 1955: ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy"" - Eddie Parker as Klaris

Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. are horror movie legends, but Tom Tyler and Eddie Parker are nearly forgotten.
Tom Tyler was a B-Movie actor who starred in nearly 100 low-budget Westerns.
Eddie Parker was a stuntman/actor with 305 listings on the IMDB data base.
Photo 1 = Tom Tyler out-of-makeup
Photo 2 = Eddie Parker out-of-makeup
[Eddie Parker is driving the car. The better-known bit player Anthony Warde is aiming the gun (source: IMDB)]

* Karloff played Frankenstein and the Mummy.
Lugosi played Dracula and Frankenstein.
Only Lon Chaney Jr. played all four monsters.
-- Karloff also starred in two later Frankenstein sequels, but not as the monster:
""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) as Dr. Niemann (mad scientist) and
""Frankenstein 1970"" (1958) as Baron Victor von Frankenstein (ditto)

The wonderfully cheesy ""Mummy's Hand"" (1940) is less a sequel, and more a re-make of ""The Mummy"" (1932).
The only character common to both films is the Pharaoh Amenophis (an actual historical figure).
In ""The Mummy"", Imhotep steals the Sacred Scroll of Thoth in an attempt to bring the Pharaoh's daughter, Ankh-es-en-Amon, back to life.
In ""The Mummy's Hand"", Kharis steals the Sacred Tana Leaves in an attempt to bring the Pharaoh's daughter, Ananka, back to life.
Convicted of blasphemy, both Imhotep and Kharis are sentenced to be wrapped as Mummies and buried alive.
British actor George Zucco played the high priest of Karnak in the first three sequels.
Any film with George Zucco in it is guaranteed to be both wonderful and cheesy.

Three new Blu-Rays, one reissue:

Disc 1 (""The Mummy"" + bonus features) is the 2012 Hi-Def Blu-Ray transfer used in the Universal Classic Monsters Blu-Ray Collection (8 discs).
-- Universal Blu-Rays released before 2015 do not have the ""Resume Movie"" option.
When your viewing is interrupted in the middle of a film, you cannot resume watching at the point where you left off, but have to go back to the beginning of the disc.
I wish Universal had re-engineered Disc 1 to include that convenient feature, but I guess they wanted to save money.
Not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice.
(the actual picture quality is not affected).

Discs 2-4 (five films) were transferred to Hi-Def in 2014 in preparation for Universal's 100th Anniversary.
Released on DVD in 2014 (but DVD cannot reproduce all the details of the Hi-Def master).
The belated Blu-Ray release comes in 2017 with this Mummy Legacy collection.
Beautiful black and white pictures + they have the ""Resume Movie"" feature.

""Legacy Collection"" boxes not yet on Blu-Ray:
-- The Invisible Man (six films)
-- The Creature from the Black Lagoon (three films)

Universal has been extra-thorough in assembling these boxes, which means there is considerable overlap among the Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man franchises (at least the prices were kept low.)
BUT the Mummy never met the Wolf Man or Frankenstein or Dracula  (neither did the Invisible Man).

The 30 film mega-box also included the 1943 ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Claude Rains (only one film; no sequels).

However, after seeing many older B&W movies in the Blu-ray format I am happy to admit that the Blu-ray transfer is well worth the money. The picture is much sharper and more defined in the BR format than it was in the DVD format. This has held true across movies from the 30's, 40's, and early 50's. As an added bonus the cost of BR movies continues to drop per movie so that you can buy a package of 4, 5, or 6 movies for less than $30.

The Mummy series from Universal studios is a unique product.  The Mummy is not based on another medium like Dracula (Bram Stoker) or Frankenstein (Mary Shelly) but created in-house by Universal writers.  The original film features the characters we know from the later day smash hit with Brendan Fraser, but here we have Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep and his risen counterpart, Adith Bey.  In later films, we see other actors playing the Mummy including Wolfman star, Lon Chaney, Jr.  All the films are entertaining but I did have a slight problem with so much of the story set in the USA... This is a very watchable set of films.  They are provided on 3 DVD disks.so the quality is very good and they are not squeezed to together.

DVD transfer is very good considering the age of the these films.  They look new.  Nice job, Universal.

6474800,4,B00L8QP0U0,"The Mummy - Complete Legacy Collection

This product has six Mummy movies from 1932 to 1955 on DVDs. The idea of a long-dead mummy coming back to life echoes the legends of vampires. The movies from the 1940s were sequels with different stories and varying actors. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast, much better than what you may have seen on videotapes. The first two sequels are the better stories. The others are interesting but repetitive. There seems to be less interest in mummies than in the traditional vampires and werewolves as movie subjects.

The Mummy (1932) tells how a strong love persisted after 4,000 years when the lovers were reanimated to spread terror among people.

The Mummys Hand (1940) was about an expedition to Egypt te excavate an undiscovered tomb for a 3,000 year old mummy. Their success has an unexpected result.

The Mummys Tomb (1942) has the reanimated mummy coming to America in search of the mummy of Princess Ananka located in a museum at a New England college.

The Mummys Ghost (1943) continues this story. Kharis searches for the elusive Princess Ananka. Is the Mapleton Monster back in New England? Yes, and Kharis takes the woman into a swamp to elude his pursuers.

The Mummys Curse (1944) is set in Louisiana where a swamp is being drained. Kharis again searches for Princess Ananka who is reincarnated in the body of a modern woman. After the usual dramatic events the mummies are recovered and shipped to that New England museum.

Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955) tells of a professor who found the mummy of Klaris and will send it to America. Pete and Freddie visits Dr. Zummer and find trouble. There are comic skits and dances for entertainment. Will a medal reveal the location of a vast treasure? There is a secret cavern, dancing, and comic confusion. It ends in a blast.",1439337600,24,1860,4.8119122257053295
