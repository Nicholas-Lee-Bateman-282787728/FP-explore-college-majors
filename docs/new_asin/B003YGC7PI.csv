4229064,5,B003YGC7PI,"If you're a fan of independent films see Once Fallen.  Writer/Director/Actor, Ash Adams should be applauded for putting together such an incredible cast - there was a lot of good chemistry.  His performance as a dirty cop is disarming and memorable. It is hard to believe that this movie was made for $650,000 and in only 19 days!

Once Fallen is a crime drama with a very touching theme about relationships between best friends and fathers and sons. There is also an interracial relationship (WMBW) that was very touching and added to the complexity this film.

The strong performances of the stellar cast adds to the raw emotion of the film. This film deserves a lot more attention and I will be recommending it to my friends.",1290729600,3,728,4.708661417322834
4229065,1,B003YGC7PI,"Wow.  I made the mistake of getting this movie at a redbox.  I wish I had my $1.08 and two hours of my life back.
I am a huge Ed Harris fan, and I guess someone either did a really good job selling him the script, or he desperately needed a little cash.  And by little, I mean LITTLE, since this movie must have had a budget smaller than my kids' weekly allowance.
Ed Harris was the highlight, but the rest of the acting was sub-par compared to your local community theater.
I would not reccommend this movie to anyone.  Horrible.",1289520000,2,530,4.217821782178218
4229066,4,B003YGC7PI,"Ash Adams, wrote, directed, produced and acted in this very raw story of a family challenged by a life of crime in San Pedro, California.  While the film has some brittle edges, editing flaws that disturb the flow of the story, the acting is so fine that these flaws become minor.  It is a small budget film populated with some of the finest actors in the business and the result makes for a film that deserves more attention than it received in the theater.

Chance (Brian Presley, in a career changing role) has been released from five years in prison for a crime in which he took the blame for a number of his friends and family.  Upon release he discovers that his ex-girlfriend Kat (Alison Eastwood) gave birth to their son August while Chance was in jail. Kat promptly walks out on Chance and August, leaving Chance to parent a child he didn't even know he fathered.  Chance's friend Beat (Chad Lindberg) is a damaged man, having witnessed with Chance the brutal slaughter of a man by Chance's father Liam (Ed Harris), a man who has been in prison since and has become the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood.  Beat has a debt that must be paid and pleads with Chance to do one more Cocaine sale for dirty cop Rath (Ash Adams) to free himself from that debt and get on with life.  Chance wants to turn his life around, tries to pay off Beat's debt by participating in a knuckle fight for the operator Eddie (Peter Weller), but when he loses the fight all bets are off.  Chance visits his blind aunt Rose (Amy Madigan) and her friend Sue (Sharon Gless) and Rose insists Chance visit his father Liam in the jail.  Chance also becomes attached to a friend of Kat's named Pearl (Taraji P. Henson) and Pearl helps Chance to find fatherhood with August and a relationship with her.  From all of these setups come encounters that alter the story with realistic views of the corruption of San Pedro as well as a coming together of Chance and his father  whose turbulent family history is revealed at the end of the film.

The cast is excellent: Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Taraji P. Henson, Peter Weller, Ash Adams, Chad Lindberg and especially Brian Presley give high quality performances as do the supporting cast members.  This little film may be tough and raw, but the underlying importance of family is strong and well worth attention from a wider audience.  Grady Harp, November 10",1289433600,3,2377,4.562352941176471
4229067,2,B003YGC7PI,"Once Fallen (2010) is the kind of movie you'd most likely only find at a film festival in the huddled masses of other enthusiasts doing a poor job of time management and filling their schedule with copious amounts of nutrients, beverages, and screenings.  You'd probably first catch Ed Harris (who needs no introduction) in the credits followed by Taraji P. Henson (Hustle & Flow, The Curious Case of Ben. Button) and Amy Madigan (Gone Baby Gone) and consider whether or not to see yet another zombie horror flick or yet another crime drama.  You might stumble across the DVD at your local rental place, one copy tucked between an alien space saga and a sketchy rom-com and think to yourself, who is the writer-director behind this film?

4229070,4,B003YGC7PI,"Ed Harris portrays a jailed convict with a long criminal past.  His son just recently released from prison wants to break free from following in his father's footsteps, but is drawn into the crime world by a family friend.  His wife leaves him with the care of their son and he realizes the futility of crime as a way of life.  Ed Harris and his son try to work through their differences; there is no way out of Ed, but his son works toward a normal life in which to raise his son.  Good solid movie, has violence, emotional moments, and a ray of hope.  I recommend.",1376697600,,566,4.252336448598131

4229072,2,B003YGC7PI,"... and that's why I bought it. But I'm sorry, half way through I was just waiting for it to end. Actually the best acting performance in the film was by Ash Adams - and I did not realize he was the director until the movie credits came up at the end. Two of my favorite actors ever, Ed Harris [""Jacknife""] and Amy Madigan [""Twice in a Lifetime"" and ""In the Name of the People""] - were wasted in their roles, I feel. However, I don't think there were good roles for them in this film, and they weren't afforded meaty enough material to make their performances memorable.

The prison scenes were not believable. What maximum security prison do you know of where you are able to visit an inmate right in his own cell? When the dad [Ed Harris] and the son [Brian Presley] were arguing at the top of their lungs like they were going to fight there was not a corrections officer in sight. The entire movie looked to be thrown together. I realize it was low-budget and there were problems with the production, but the consumer is not required to take any of that into consideration. All we know is that we want to see a great movie. When I saw Ed Harris' name on the DVD cover I just wanted to check it out. ""Once Fallen"" is not a movie I will watch again.",1334188800,2,1250,4.2301255230125525
4229073,3,B003YGC7PI,"Movie has a bit of a slow pace and leaves many unanswered questions. Particularly annoying is the ""whisper"". Not explaining that isn't edgy, it's silly. Mostly people feel robbed for being teased about details like that. Certainly, I've never noticed movie boxes advertising ""Leaves you to interpret your own meaning, must see!!!"". The ending was good, if a bit predictable. I don't feel like I wasted my time with the movie, but it's not for everyone.

Was very well acted by all involved. Much less ham than the mouthing breathing ensemble of the Twilight Saga, for instance.

BTW, several of the reviews for this movie listed between Oct 2010 & Nov 2010, are fake. The reviewers all say the same crap about how the movie was made on a shoestring budget, under a tight schedule, they all deliver 5 stars, and just happen to only have one review per username; lame.

Either the movie is good or it's not. It's not suddenly better than it was just because I know it was made cheaply. Should have cut out the less needed acting parts and spent more on your script.

Either way, I enjoyed it, but wouldn't recommend to many people.",1306108800,2,1129,4.63
4229074,4,B003YGC7PI,"I came across this movie trailer while searching for another one and was very interested. When I read the reviews on Amazon, I became a little wary. Boy am I glad I went with my curiosity!
I never really got the feeling that the budget was low while watching this movie. And I came away thinking this could easily be someone's life under those same circumstances. I thought it was well directed but a little choppy at times. Never the less, it held my attention until the very end.
Ed Harris is a genious. He is one of only a very few that can draw you in like a moth to a flame, saying so much with little actually being said. Peter Weller was fun to watch as the comedy relief in this dark drama. In fact, all of the actors in this film did a great job. I prefer this movie to anything the big budget studios are showing today.",1303689600,6,829,4.15527950310559
4229075,2,B003YGC7PI,"This is definitely a ""B"", low budget movie.  I like Ed Harris and in general I'd say the acting was pretty good but this is a very poor movie.  I was duped into watching it by these ridiculously favorable reviews.  In all fairness, I believe two stars is generous.  Don't waste your time with this movie.",1303430400,2,304,4.375
4229076,5,B003YGC7PI,"Honestly, if this had not popped up on our instant play list on Netflix, my husband and I would never have watched this movie, but I'm glad we did. This is one of those compelling human dramas that draws viewers in with its difficult subject matter, and credible performances by a talented ensemble cast. Though Ed Harris is in this movie, and delivers a powerful performance, Brian Presley delivers a visceral performance as Chance, an ex-con who wishes to get away from a life of crime.

The story begins with a young Chance and his best friend Beat by the beach in San Pedro. Ed Harris plays Chance's father Liam, and when Liam sees Beat's bruised and battered face, he storms Beat's house in a fit of rage. His violence results in Beat's father's death and Liam is sentenced to life in prison. Fast forward years later - Chance has just been released after serving five years in prison. His only wish is to lead a clean life, yet his past stalks him unrelentingly. Beat, his childhood friend (Chad Lindberg in a memorable performance) is a tortured and damaged soul who can't seem to escape his own traumatic past. Chance feels a sense of loyalty to Beat, and this loyalty prevents him from just walking away when he is asked to make good on Beat's debts to a mobster and also a crooked cop, Rath (Ash Adams who also wrote and directed this film). Meanwhile, Chance makes a startling discovery - he is the father of a five-year-old boy August by his ex-girlfriend Kat. When Kat leaves to pursue her own interests, Chance is left at a loss. In steps Pearl (Taraji P. Henson) who helps Chance find his footing.

With all this drama unfurling, there's still the parallel story of Chance's father, Liam who has since moved up the prison ranks to become the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood. A quiet and contemplative man, Liam's sole wish is to see his son safe, and he risks everything to ensure Chance gets a second go at leading a normal life. The stories are actually quite well-woven together, but viewers who are looking for a fast-paced, shoot-em'-up action flick will be sorely disappointed. Instead, viewers get treated to a leisurely-paced yet intense human drama that explores the various facets of human relationships - of what drives them, and how one man tries to steer the right path even though the odds are stacked against him. In this, the movie succeeds very well, and instead of being a purely Ed Harris vehicle, the movie shows off a talented ensemble cast (that also includes Peter Weller as a mobster). Final verdict -a thought-provoking drama with credible character development.",1294185600,10,2602,4.716483516483517

The main character is a guy who has had some tough breaks in life from a very young age, but he didn't have a horrible childhood up until a certain point.  The story begins with him getting out of jail, discovering he has a son, meeting Taraji's character, trying to avoid heading back down the road that took him to jail, and making a new start. The acting is good and the story is interesting.  I would watch it again.",1436832000,2,500,4.166666666666667

It is excellent well written, directed and acted. When I find something really good in the genre that I love I try and give a review. Please watch  this movie it's excellent. Two thumbs up.
