376813,2,6301896424,"This over-hyped DVD short-changes us on many levels. At over 2  hours, one would expect a fairly complete coverage of Michael's life, but it does not live up to that expectation. Fully two-thirds is dedicated to Michael in his early years with the J5/Jacksons. What we have, is mostly talking heads, interspersed with photo collages and video clips, virtually all of which are probably familiar to even the most casual fan. Of the talking heads, we have Rebbie, Tito, and Katherine Jackson, all of whom came across well. But beyond them, the only notables are Smoky Robinson, Dionne Warwick, and Whitney Houston. Most of the rest are behind-the-scenes music industry people, only a few names of which I even recognized. It was interesting to hear Bobby Taylor's perspective, which I had not heard before. Tom Mesereau gets a couple of short cameos. Randy Taraborelli gets quite a bit of face time; the good news in that, is that he seems to have now decided that Michael was totally innocent, which the revised (2009) version of his biography of Michael did not clearly convey.
Michael's solo career is only addressed up to Thriller, and even that part is disappointing. We also get a glimpse of the 30th anniversary concert, but that was to be expected as David Gest was responsible for that event, and this is his production (which, naturally, gets him lots of face time as well). Footage of adult Michael performing is almost totally missing, which, to my way of thinking, omits a huge part of his life. Not a single clip of any short films was included.
The good news is that it is mostly well done as a production; it's the content, or lack thereof, that merits my low review.
Unless you positively MUST have everything about Michael in your collection, save your money.",1320537600,13,1775,4.7817589576547235
376814,1,6301896424,"I saw this and was completely disgusted. Gest is just another ""friend"" that betrayed Michael Jackson on every level he could. I am amazed, but not surprised that some of Michael's family joined in this fiasco and disappointed that Tom Messereau did too. This is just another tabloid junk movie, pretending to be a real documentary. Use your money to buy something worthwhile like Invincible or Blood on the Dancefloor.",1320537600,21,418,4.985714285714286
376815,1,6301896424,"Regarding David Gest's Michael Jackson: Life of an Icon

About this ""documentary"" I must speak.

I located and watched this on YouTube before deciding whether to buy it. Needless to say, I'm NOT going to buy it.
I actually had trouble sleeping last night after viewing this, it just disturbed me and caused me such pain. It is extremely exploitative of Michael. Like ripping yet another fresh metaphoric wound into this sweet, private man's mind-body-soul. And into the human psyche of anyone watching it who cares about Michael, the human being.

First part was a bit too long, but that was the part I enjoyed. Because the people being interviewed were not grinding axes into Michael's bones or betraying any confidences.

But then, in a most obvious, awkward transition, the piece verges into Tabloid Junkie-land. There is a segment with flashes of ""different faces"" of Michael that reminded me of the trash media's ""morphing faces"" of Michael which they LOVE(D) to play over and over. But what made my heart just ache and my stomach turn were the questionable-at-best personas whom Gest decided to ""represent"" Michael Jackson. Names such as Cascio, Taraborrelli, DiLeo, even Gest himself.
Old saying: ""With friends like these, who needs enemies""...

1.) Cascio out-and-out contradicts himself saying on night of MSG in 2001, he found MJ asleep in NYC hotel room, supposedly asked him, ""what have you taken"" to which Michael was supposed to have said ""I took a shot of Demerol, my back is really hurting""..  Yet, Cascio and his whole family told freakin'-Oprah on her show that they had NEVER seen Michael on ANY KIND of drugs WHATSOEVER.

Cascio speaks of Michael in a most contemptuous, condescending manner that broke my heart and ENRAGED me at the same time. And then there is the hatchet job he did on Elizabeth Taylor. You can see how Gest edited that segment in a particularly hateful manner against Liz. Do we really believe Michael would have wanted this? In their scurrilous attempt to cast Elizabeth Taylor as a false-friend to Michael, they are ultimately casting a glaring light onto themselves.

2.) Taraborrelli. Don't get me started. Another ""wanna-be insider"" in Michael Jackson's life. Or, more accurately, NOT in his life. Never read his MJ ""bio"", never will. Only a few excerpts from it online, that was more than ENOUGH for me to get this guy's number. He's another media whore living off MJ. In Gest's film, Taraborrelli props up LMP as ""honest"" when we've all seen her doing the media circuit for years lying on Michael. Granted Taraborrelli is saying this in the context of LM saying that her and Michael's marriage was real ... but to say she is ""an honest person"" is a laughable, upside-down, INACCURATE premise.

So they (Taraborrelli, Cascio, Gest) shamelessly go after and vilify Elizabeth Taylor, Jermaine, and (predictably) La Toya ... but LM, she's ""honest"". No she's just cut from the same mold as them, and aggressors always protect/camouflage their own kind.

Like Cascio, Taraborrelli takes a certain glee in speaking of Michael in a condescending, dehumanizing manner. These sycophants know how to straddle the line between saying ""good"" things about Michael and then turning around in the next breathe and taking a cruel stab at him. Twisting and distorting. Day is night, night is day. Down is up, up is down. Dehumanizing. Character assassinating. Sell-Outs. Predators. Sad.
All I can say is to ask yourself what you would do in that situation. Would you protect Michael or prostitute him? Where's the TRUE LOVE from these predators? Where's their ethics, their conscience? Exploitation ridiculously propped up as ""honesty"". Why dig in the dirt when there's SO MUCH MICHAEL LIGHT & LOVE to reflect upon?

The inhumanity makes me heart sick.

The fact that Gest managed to get Katherine, Tito, Rebbie, Mesereau and Yu to participate, only to use them as peripheral afterthoughts - as a means of trying to legitimize his cheesy flick - is unfortunate.

I wish that I could keep just the first half of this film, as there are some great video moments and still photos.
I also feel Gest does a good job of defending Michael Jackson through the allegations and trial, showing Sneddon for the wicked, vindictive hatemonger he SOOOOO IS!!!!!!  I'll give Gest that credit.

But unfortunately..

The film is a mess. It's a bias, choppy, sensational exploit.
In short, the film is as schizophrenic as I believe Gest is, himself.

Footnote: Notice at the UK Premiere Q&A of Gest's film that Cascio and Taraborrelli are nowhere to be found. Rather it is the respected and dignified likes of Katherine, Rebbie, Tito, Mesereau, Yu and some Motown legends whom Gest chooses to use once again, and flaunt on his big night.

376816,1,6301896424,"They can't get enough of sucking the meat out of their sibling / son's bones.  They have found another way to exploit his death..with a half assed ""documentary"".  These people should be ashamed of themselves.

Believe it, this documentary had nothing to do with Michael Jackson and everything with making money off a tragedy.  The Jacksons, once again, show how classless, unethical, greedy, conniving, backstabbing and tacky they are.

We have known that for years....MJ's death only reinforces that fact.  Once can't help by be proud, that he himself realized it, and kicked them out of his life.",1320451200,8,598,5.051020408163265

Paul Anka stating that MJ illegally stole and copied the TII demo tape and way too much time focused on the 2005 allegations and trial. Some of your highlights folks!

376818,5,6301896424,"My husband and I just finished watching this documentary and wiped away the tears long enough to write this review. Now, if you've read any of my Michael Jackson reviews, then it should come as no surprise that I loved this documentary. No, not by default, just because I love Michael Jackson; but because this documentary is outstandingly put together and does this kind, talented man justice, without tabloid sensationalism.

This documentary attempts to define Michael's enigma, that even his family, at times, struggles to comprehend. It paints a picture of a child destined to be a megastar, who masterfully steered his own destiny, until critical mass enveloped his shooting star, and even he struggled to keep control of the Super Nova called Fame that blasted him out of the stratosphere. This film gave us chills from the moment it started until the end credits rolled. There really are no words to describe how it made us feel. But somehow it captured the essence of Michael; the highs along with the lows, the joy along with the tragedy. At times, it was almost painful to watch, but we were riveted to say the least.

Katherine Jackson herself, appears in this documentary, along with other family and dozens of close friends and colleagues. There's a great mix of historical footage and recent clips from the King's untimely passing; all of which gave me chills for different reasons. The recent footage is heartbreaking; the older stuff is both happily nostalgic and bittersweet. Ultimately, this is a poetic visual collage in tribute to a very unique and special human being indeed; the likes of which is sorely lacking in this world, now that he is gone. This is the part where cynics roll their eyes, but I bet not one of them has given as much to charity and the needy as Michael. If they had, they wouldn't be cynics. Spreading hate is all too easy, spreading love, however, is much more difficult and rarely appreciated. But remember, whenever you scoff with arrogance or dismissive laughter, you've done nothing to add kindness, compassion or love to this world.

This documentary reminds us that Michael didn't just ""have it,"" he also ""got it,"" which is what set him apart and made him even more special than the sum of all his talents combined. Michael knew it wasn't enough to make #1 records, he knew to use that as a springboard to help others and make the world a better place. To treat all human beings as equals, and with kindness. To add ramps to Neverland for those of us that are disabled, long before it was legally required. To jump into a hot tub with a sick boy with AIDS, at a time when the medical community was afraid to even touch such patients. To say Michael Jackson was ahead of his time is trite. But this film shows how even those closest to him struggled to grasp his vision and world view. Michael saw further, reached higher, and pulled the world closer as those around him watched in awe. Luckily they knew well enough to help him attain the highest heights, even if they didn't always understand. But this film shows that sometimes, the yes-man mentality only worked to Michael's own detriment, and got those who dared to question ousted from his inner circle. But no matter how you look at it, Michael was the crown jewel of rare gems, indeed; shiny, sparkly and splendidly bright.

David Gest did a fantastic job producing and compiling this documentary. Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't get a theatrical release. But it clearly took a man with his access and prior friendship with Michael to win the trust of the likes of Mrs. Jackson and so many others, and get them to participate in the making of this film. This isn't some hokey made for TV movie; this is top-shelf filmmaking at its best. I've been involved in a few small productions, so I have a tiny inkling of what it takes to put something like this together, and I must say, ""impressed"" doesn't express my feelings emphatically enough. This film masterfully touches all the right notes, and is worthy of a Best Documentary nomination, had it been released in theaters. It does not shy away from the tough subjects, nor does it unfairly railroad Michael, by allowing the darker elements of his story, overshadow the brilliance of his legacy.

For those crying foul that this is ""just another money grab,"" it's pretty simple -- if you don't want to spend your money on this DVD, then don't. Personally, I like seeing Michael still hitting #1 and breaking records, even after his death; that's a fitting tribute even MJ would appreciate.

I think this Blu Ray was well worth the purchase price, and I thank my kind husband for buying it for me. I can't wait to watch the added bonuses, and know I will watch this movie again and again; in fact, I'm planning on watching it a second time as soon as I post this review. But I wanted to come here and share my immediate impressions with anyone that may be on the fence about purchasing this film. Actually, this documentary is the perfect compliment to This Is It; offering somewhat of a bookend to the events which surrounded those rehearsals and concert film. In many ways, This Is It was lacking footage like this, but then, these are two distinctly different films.

Bottom Line -- Michael Jackson: The Life Of An Icon, is a fitting tribute and has already become a treasured addition to my video library. I know I will watch it again and again, just like I'll read certain books about him and listen to his music again and again. Michael still manages to bring me happiness, illuminate my darkest days, lift my sprits and help me get through. What a gift -- what a man -- what a movie! A big thank you to the filmmakers who put this together, and the people who gave their time to appear in this film, especially you, Mrs. Jackson; much love and respect. Your strength and resolve is admirable, to say the very least. Bravo! Love you forever, Michael!

... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my Blu Ray! I don't want to keep Ms. Katherine waiting. And I'd much rather bury myself in this movie another 20 times, than see another minute of that fiasco called a trial going on right now, 20 minutes from home.",1320105600,2,6183,4.619654231119199

One thing I will say, is that it's about time the people truly responsible for The Jackson 5's success got their due. People like Bobby Taylor and the like.

""Thriller"" selling over 100 million albums is mentioned, and some photos are shown from ""Bad"", but nothing after that is spoken about. Everything from ""Dangerous"" to ""Invincible"" is virtually ignored, and the editing almost seems like it was deliberately cut out. Following what little is mentioned of ""Bad"", the last 45 minutes of the documentary focus on the 1993 and 2003 molestation trials.

Another thing that bothers me is the lack of participation from most of the Jackson family. Katherine, Rebbie, and Tito did interviews, but there's nothing from Joseph, Jermaine, Jackie, Janet, LaToya, Marlon, or Randy. Stories are told by others about them, but they themselves do not appear in this film. Its sad too, because so much could be clarified if they'd agreed.

I thought this was an excellent documentary about Michael, it wasn't false or sugar coated as another reviewer put it, it was from the heart of the people who where very close to Michael without all the hype.

Michael and his beautiful mother where so much alike, very gentle and trusting people who wanted to do the right thing by everybody, which unfortunately for Michael that turned out not for the best, as people took advantage of him and abused his trust, the trust he had in them.

I enjoyed hearing his family talk about him with love and affection and also funny and fond memories, and I am glad we did not see his father interviewed.

Unfortunately I think, the second child molest case really got to him as it would anybody who was innocent. With it being so long every day for 5 months that would make any genuine honest person go insane.

I think that it was the start of the end for Michael then. So I hope that, that pathetic prosecution and those pathetic individuals, involved can sleep at night knowing that their sinister plan to grab, as much money as humanily possible and also to trash Michael's reputation  IN TURN BLEW UP IN THEIR FACES. ""PARASITES""

I will always appreciate what Michael gave us...He was one in a Billion. A shining star from a very early age. You could see it a mile off.

Also with his brothers they all helped bring popular black music to the white audiences now aint that somethin.

As alot of people will say. We will never see another Michael Jackson but then again we don't need too, there will only be one Michael Jackson. He was the King of Pop and a legend as well. His Legacy will live on.

Thank-you this DVD helped clear up alot of misconceptions I had.

I can't believe all the negative reviews about this DVD, it is really quite unnecessary. Michael is gone but he's family and friends remember him well. Just enjoy it for that.",1331337600,3,2090,4.430809399477806

377080,4,6301896424,"I am assuming that all of the bad reviews on this ground breaking documentary about Michael's life, are stemming from the fact that there is really no performance footage of Michael in this film.  If you want to see previous concert footage, then go out and rent or buy ""THIS IS IT""!!!  This documentary is meant as a tribute to the King Of Pop, spoken from the words and hearts of the people in his life who knew him and were close to him---his family and friends, including many legends in the music industry, recording artists, song writers and producers.  IT IS NOT TABLOID TRASH, as some reviewers have already referred to it as.

If you want to see some of the inner workings of just how ""A Star Is Born"" and what goes on in this business from the viewpoint of those who have been there, then this DVD is for you.

Yes, the film does move slow at times, but if you are into the history of the Jackson Family and the early exposure of R&B, Disco and Dance music into the Pop mainstream beginning in the early 70's, then you will find this film extremely interesting, informative and thought provoking.

Those who are interviewed in this film include Michael's best friend, David Gest, (who is the ex-husband of Liza Minnelli, by the way, and who also conducts many of the interviews in the film), Jackson Family biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, Kathryn Jackson, Tito Jackson, Rebbie Jackson, Smokey Robinson, Dionne Warwick, Martha Reeves, Freda Payne, Whitney Houston, Peabo Bryson and husband and wife recording team of Ashford & Simpson.  This film by the way is also one of the last interviews that Nick Ashford gave, prior to his death last year in 2011.

The only problem I had with this film is that the subtitles of the names and status of the folks being interviewed were flashed  WAY TOO FAST, and I had to reverse the DVD several times jut to read these at the bottom of the screen.  The same went for the timeline captions as well.

This film is a MUST for all Michael Jackson fans and for true music lovers of the recording industry and some of its extremely rich history.

Yes, this man made some bad decisions in his personal life (haven't we all???), but he was still a musical genius and one of THE GREATEST entertainers of all time.

GOD BLESS Michael Jackson for leaving such a strong legacy of music, dance, song, love and inspiration that will live on forever!!!",1328140800,6,2389,4.553738317757009

My eyes welled up many times when I watched the DVD for the first time.  My heart aches when I think of what MJ had been through because the greed of those surrounded MJ.  At the same time, I have the utmost respect for Mr Tom Mesereau and Katherine Jackson for what they said and did for MJ.

377109,4,6301896424,"Awhile back, I stumbled upon this DVD on Amazon and read a bunch of awful reviews on it. A couple weeks ago I was on Netflix and clicked some random documentary about MJ with another title, not realizing it was the same as this, just incorrectly labeled. I don't understand why so many people on here are giving it such horrible reviews, I really didn't find it to be that bad!

The first half shows people reflecting on Michael growing up, including Katherine, Tito and Rebbie Jackson, Smokey Robinson, Dionne Warwick, many involved with Motown and other close friends. Yes, there really isn't any NEW information to those of us who have been fans for a long time, but it's still interesting to see what these people have to say about Michael and watch as they show their clear appreciation and admiration of this man.

The second half goes into detail about some of the problems Michael faced that has always been broadcasted in the media. If anything, I think this documentary sheds more light on MJ than anything. It discusses his plastic surgery, Vitiligo, and goes into detail about the 1993 and 2005 allegations. However, it doesn't say anything negative about Michael, it actually puts some rumors to rest and tells the truth behind the rumors and accusations.

It's about 2 and a half hours long but if you're a fan or just want to find out more information about Michael Jackson, I'd definitely recommend it!",1323043200,2,1418,4.732793522267206

A lot about the scandals that plagued him but I felt there wasn't a broad enough representation of the people who knew Michael. The only members of his family that spoke were his mother, Tito, and his sister Rebbie, whom I'd never heard of until now. I was really expecting more people from his life to give their perspectives.

I did enjoy watching it though, for the photos and (limited)video footage. There wasn't hardly enough of those things, though. A lot of still shots from the Jackson 5 days but not enough video. I enjoy watching Michael perform and especially his performances as child but there was very little video, considering this is a documentary.",1322956800,,737,4.713178294573644

For those who are considering buying this DVD, you should know that this is a well-crafted, professionally executed production consisting of many photos, a few live clips and superb narration throughout.  And, when you least expect it, there are a few audio segments of Michael speaking - that polite gentleness of his spirit is unmistakable and a welcomed surprise. It's one of those many moments that makes you simply want to reach out and embrace him. There is another moment when his mom recalls his first days of life - the day she brought him home from the hospital.  So full of emotion, this was the one and only time during more than 30 minutes of interviews that she was unable to complete her story.  She is by far the greatest Jackson historian. She, much like Michael, exudes a soft-spoken kindness and although she is now in her 80s, she is just as sharp as ever.

I will always cherish these authentic trips down memory lane. Katherine, Rebie, Tito and so many other celebs provided so many glimpses behind the glitz; many of them humorous and all of them priceless. I will watch this one again soon. Enjoy!",1322956800,,1382,4.7615062761506275

377115,4,6301896424,"Iridescent as Michael Jackson was and probably IS and will be (from his body of music and labors). This film did a great JUSTICE in humanizing a man who knew the weight and significance of MYSTERY (hence keeping most of his life private).

Contrary to the most self aggrandizing ""Look at me, I'm the greatest Michael Jackson Fan ever, but never grew up with him"" tirades thinly disguised as reviews. These aren't weighted lies. David Guest even had the respect to keep anything approaching self aggrandizement out of the documentary/remembrances whatever you may wish to call it.

If you watch the few ""cutting room floor"" extras, you'll know that his editing perspective kept much of the controversy to a low key (such as Rebbie talking about her albums, Katherine's statement omitted in the real film that Tito when starting in fact played guitar better than his father) I noted a reviewer suggested he made a bad impression of Elizabeth Taylor (divorced from the film maker) No. He just reiterated a PECULIARITY of their friendship. Michael goaded her out of her dungeon with a $250,000 smile.

If anything this is a respectful presentation. Much of the substance the poor reviewers wish to declaim and deride is in fact truth. They didn't violate Michael's respect by talking about his private life in this instance, they never named names, they simply acknowledged what those in his inner circle knew. HE WASN'T GAY.

They gave an accurate description of the public's curiosity over Michael's public seemingly ASEXUAL identity, and corroborated the fact that the public was ready to string him up once AN identity was presented by the opportunist accuser Evan Chandler (who killed himself in 2009 AND nearly killed his own child in 2003-5) and unfortunately that was an image that ultimately shrouded him in his later life, and also took it's toll on his psyche.

I'm coming to the conclusion that the people who call this tabloid trash miss the point and significance of this film. Maybe they've jumped on the recent bandwagon and forgotten that Michael was a human being. I'm almost certain that Guest had reservations about doing this documentary but PROBABLY had stated it as a MISSION after hearing others rehash trash about his friend.

In fact maybe this film isn't meant for younger fans. It's probably intended for us who grew up hearing and listening and reading about the man while he was alive. Get your head out of the sky and come back to Earth.

They did a great justice interviewing many who grew up alongside Michael as well as many of his labelmates, songwriters and confidants. It was an even handed look at his CAREER (musically), his PERSONALITY and his GOALS. The segments dealing with the early J5 approach the matter with utmost respect and interview their original drummer and keyboardist much like any credible and thoroughly researched MUSIC DOCUMENTARY would do.

True, a reviewer has suggested that the film is in two parts. The first focuses on childhood and the J5 and the second is Michael's solo career, which due to The Estate of Michael Jackson and Licensing, omits all of his output from Off The Wall onward. HOWEVER, this is not purely a musical documentary; the intent of the film was to ""set the story straight"".

Another point someone barked about: WE ALL KNEW Michael was loaded at the MSG. It's sad but the public ridiculed this man and during that era of his life he canceled quite a few scheduled concerts. In this instance I'm certain he was DREADING working with his brothers again, mostly for all the dregs it would drudge up. This film CONCISELY shows that Michael was lampooned, hurt, pushed down but never relented.

I'm kinda astounded that a malign, effacing, OPINIONATED review is made to sound like ""the most helpful review"", which will detract from this film's viewership. Shame on you.

OF COURSE MICHAEL KEPT A COPY OF THE PAUL ANKA SONG he probably kept copies of all his work. HOWEVER, HE HAD NOT RELEASED IT. The reviewers' ears must be shut, it was all CLEARLY EXPLAINED in the film. After his death the estate had come across it in his private holding and had released it uknowingly thinking it was NEW.

I'm surprised at how LAZY the general public is regarding READING these days. The fact that this film is poorly reviewed is indicative of ""judging a book by it's cover""

The film is a labor of love. Even Thomas Mesereau is in it. Sure there are better documentaries that cover the extent of the Arvizo debacle, but this film is about MICHAEL. Hearing loving stories from some of the luminaries AND the UNSUNG writers and Bobby Taylor was rewarding in itself.

If you're capable of thinking, and like Michael this is a documentary not to be missed.

If you're an old miser aged 30-50 (usually) white guy who already made up his mind based on doing absolutely no research about the man, then this one isn't for you. You'll probably not have the capacity to comprehend much else other than the picture of Bubbles pointing at a picture of himself and Michael while you pull the lice from your back and groin (you public ape).

If you're a new fan who thinks Michael was infallible, and NEVER had any cosmetic surgery, then this isn't for you.

The film respects him BUT to the typical critics, this film omits his solo era much like a series like THE WONDER YEARS couldn't get released without a PLETHORA of MUSIC CLEARANCES. It would simply COST TOO MUCH.",1322784000,14,5424,4.771611526147279

It made me love and miss Michael even more. This documentary covers alot of Michael's life and i think its worth buying especially for the new fans , instead of buying so many books about Michael this is probably money saver in that view. And then if your truly want to know Michael buy Moonwalk, and Conspiracy and Redemption to learn about 2005 case and extortion in 1993.

I was amazed how those incredible artists from Motown saw Michael as a little boy, it made me realise what extraordinary talent Michael actually had, how he danced and sang the songs of his idols like them , even better than them. it was absolutely incredible, it sent chills through me, no doubt Michael was born to do that stuff, and you have to be born for music to achieve what Michael had achieved.

This documentary put Michael's life into perspective for me, how he was tortured and destroyed before our eyes, because of his incredible talent and the wealth he has made from it, because of his beautiful soul and the fact that he only wanted to do good on this world.  And nobody ever had a problem shreding Michael's life into pieces forgetting or ignoring what he has done. Wow, what a respect was shown to someone who saved music industry, who broke all cultural and racial barriers, who gave millions of dollars of his own money to charities etc.

This was heartbreaking to watch and realize what has been done to him. I just hope that he was never alone when he felt physical or the emotional pain. I will never stop hurting for Michael.",1322438400,,1756,4.495297805642633

I wish there were more interviews (or comments) from other members of his family but I can understand if they didn't want to be recorded.  It's been over 2 years since Michael has passed and I am sure that doing this has brought back some VERY PAINFUL emotions.  In the extra footage Mrs. Jackson just broke my heart!  I cannot imagine how TERRIBLY hard this was for her.  My prayers are with her and all her family and I hope that time will help ease the pain somewhat - but I know it will NEVER (completely) GO AWAY.  As I stated at the beginning of this review - I feel somewhat depressed after watching it and I am ONLY a fan, not somebody who was related to him or anyone that spent a lot of time with him.  Therefore, I am VERY APPRECIATIVE to David Gest for making this for ALL of us to get a better idea of who Michael was.  We all have our own opinions and we certainly are entitled to them.  I am just glad that this DVD has strengthened mine. My thanks to every one who participated in the making of this DVD and to MICHAEL for being the LOVING man that he was.

There has been so much written and broadcast about Michael Jackson and his family over the years that I think it goes without saying that there will be information that some have already heard, though I thought that in the first part of this documentary/movie it was well presented through interviews with people who were there in the early days of the Jackson 5 and Motown.
Loved the old video clips and photos too.

I do have to agree somewhat with the previous opinions about dwelling on the accusations, the trial, the alleged drug use, etc.  While we all know that these are facts of Michael's life, I do think that David Gest and whoever else made the decision regarding content for this project could have focused a little more on some of Michael's music after Off The Wall and Thriller, as well as his tours and even all the great things he did for the world.  I'm not saying they should have left out these negative things altogether, just balance it out a little.

If you want to check this out before buying, watch it on YouTube as I did.  I will be buying the DVD for my collection also.

I know there are a lot of people out there that tried and succeeded in taking advantage of this wonderful soul and so in closing, let me paraphrase a sign held by a fan outside the Courthouse in Santa Maria.....Michael, on behalf of Mankind (and the scumbag Arvizo and Chandler families) we're sorry.

I saw this movie on Youtube. I'm so glad that I didn't buy it!

These so-called friends of Michael Jackson in this movie make me sick. The things they say in this movie show that they are no friends of Michael. Gest, Cascio and Taraborrelli do not surprise me at all with their lies and betray. They have been backstabbing Michael for years. That's why Michael in time stopped seeing them. Now they are pretending to be his friends in this disgusting movie that is supposed to be a tribute to Michael, but is nothing less than trash.

The first half of the movie is pretty good showing some nice clips and stills of Michael in the early years. But the next half is no better than the tabloids. Accusing Michael for being on Demerol at one of his 30th anniversary concerts and doing too much plastic surgery etc. I felt so sick watching this! It's is supposed to be a tribute approved by Michael's mother, Katherine. Makes me so sad that Gest sold this to Katherine as being a good movie about Michael. With this movie, Gest is driving another knife in the back of the man that he always envied and now he finally has the chance to do it with the approval of his mother. SO SAD!

The movie focuses too much on the trial and all the allegations. I miss more about Michael's music and achievements, about his messages and love. The movie pretty much stops at Thriller. What about the rest?? I know how proud Michael was of his career and his achievements as well. How about all the charitable work that Michael did - why doesn't the movie tell about that? Why does the movie only focus on some parts of Michael's life? This movie lacks a lot in order to be called ""The life of an icon""!",1321833600,9,1743,4.3538461538461535

This film is like two documentaries, one much better than the other.  The first half of the film tells the story of Michael Jackson's career as a child, told through interviews of many who knew him and worked with him.  The focus of this section is on his amazing talent and, secondarily, on his appealing personality.  This is the far better half of the film.  However, the documentary completely changes once ""Off the Wall"" has been issued.  ""Thriller"" receives scant mention, and then we're in tabloid land, with absolutely no further mention of Jackson's great artistry.  Yes, we revisit the plastic surgery, Demerol, skin tone, the marriages and the allegations of child sexual abuse.  The interviewees admirably defend his reputation concerning the abuse allegations, but bring little of use to say concerning anything else.  Little is said of his philanthropy and concern for the suffering of others, and no one is interviewed who worked with him artistically as an adult.  And I had to wonder if self-labeled ""close friend"" David Guest and Frank Cascio would have said some of the things they said if Jackson had still been alive.

A MUCH better use of your money would be to buy the brilliant ""M Poetica"" by Willa Stillwater or ""Man in the Mirror"" by Joseph Vogel.",1321056000,3,1749,6.215767634854772
377166,2,6301896424,"I love MJ and have from the beginning.  Always have always will.  My DVD arrived the day the verdict came down for our hero Dr. Murray. I couldn't wait to watch it and much to my disappointment this dvd is not at all what I expected.  This is another way for others to make money off the superstars' death.  It has footage of several recording artist and their opinions of who Michael was, with very little of Michael.  I hoped that it would offer some new information or anything that I didn't already know, not a bunch of other peoples' opinions!!!  No disrespect to anyone but it's clear why the only family members they managed to get on board with this was Tito, Rebbie, and Mrs. Jackson (and honestly they weren't saying much at all).  For that reason, I was skeptical before I purchased this, but still I did.  I wish I had waited for the dvd to actually come out, so that I could've read the reviews first!! Unfortunately I pre-ordered it.  I fell asleep a couple of times while watching this.  Nothing new here, don't waste your money.  this is a mess!!",1320796800,11,1062,4.422680412371134
377167,1,6301896424,"How can a review of the 'greatest entertainer ever', a quote we hear endlessly on the 'documentary', contain virtually no footage of him performing live, no footage of his music videos, practically no interview footage with Michael. I don't think there was any footage of him performing after and including off the wall!? (his first solo album!) They talk about the legendary Motown 25th anniversary performance, and yet we have to put up with seeing still pictures from the performance. One of the only times we see Michael speak is during his congratulatory award speech, some meaningless award ceremony created by guest, only a little fragment of the speech is shown mind, and surprise surprise, it's the fragment where Michael thanks the 'wonderful' David Guest. David Guest is a disgrace. How dare this man use his supposed 'close friend' to make vast sums of money making a completely useless and lazy piece of TV. As the closing screen turns black Guest chooses the words 'rest good my friend, i love you'. I nearly vomited.

Such a shame this got made. A scorcese style 'No direction home' or 'living in the real world', needs to be made about Michaels music and performances. Not more crap to pile on to the name of the greatest of them all...",1320624000,56,1252,4.796296296296297
377168,2,6301896424,"This is the 'life of an icon'?--no, it's a lot of people giving opinions about this icon--some are interesting--many are not. Those that are not include endless comments by Tito, Taborelli, and Gest. Rebbie doesn't have much to say about anything. Katherine says just what you are used to hearing her say, which is, like Rebbie, not much. The interesting comments come from people that we haven't heard much of before--like Dione Warwick, Ron Alexenburg of CBS, Martha Reeves, Bobby Taylor, and some of the musicians Michael worked with before he went solo. Casio is very snide and disappointing and makes me seriously regret I bought his book. What is REALLY disappointing here is that there is so little of Michael--not one total clip of any song--only short snippets. You hear a few notes, and then it's off to another person's opinion. The only person who comes across as a real friend here is Thomas Mesereau. Katherine seems like she just can't cope or add 2 and 2--she says she did not want Michael to go solo, she didn't like ABC--his first hit, Joe is so misunderstood, etc. Tito also stands up for Joe as a great guy and a role model, while a couple of the music people Michael worked with talk about how abusive, ugly, and tyrannical Joe was to Michael. Tito goes so far as to say Michael was not abused (he was on 'easy street')--but he was! No wonder Michael wanted to distance himself from his family and that he ended up so alone. The main point I got from the family and 'close' friends is that they are mainly trying to cover up their lack of love for Michael by claiming they did all they could so whatever happened was not their fault. They don't want to take responsibility. I just wish there had been more of Michael in the 'Life of an Icon.'",1320537600,19,1763,4.529780564263323

7816559,3,6301896424,"The first half which covered his time in the Jackson 5 was great and the music was covered very well. It described him as a young man and you had the sense of who he was in that time. But the documentary totally fell apart shortly after the period in his life where he started a solo career. His solo career is strangely brushed over in about 5-10 minutes when his time in the Jackson 5 was discussed for over an hour. Off the Wall is talked about a bit but Thriller is only briefly mentioned, and Bad and Dangerous are not mentioned AT ALL. After that his music and even the man himself was entirely ignored in favour of the scandals and gossip that overshadowed the last period of his life. The documentary totally lost its intimacy and focus on Michael Jackson the man that it had developed so well in the beginning. It was a disappointing documentary all in all.",1521936000,,866,4.351851851851852
7816560,5,6301896424,"The doc is longer on dvd that what i've seen on television, about 2 1/2 hours long. Very nice doc and interviews, however I wished they had focused more on OTW, Thriller, and BAD era before jumping to the Dangerous era a.k.a Child abuse allegations era. They spent at least an hour in the Jackson 5 era, that in my opinion is the best part, very detailed, once they got to the Destiny era things sped up and seemed like a whirlwind between his surgeries, skin disorder, hair burn, marriages, and allegations. Overall this is my fav doc of MJ.",1519603200,,542,4.43

7816562,4,6301896424,"Life Of An Icon was released at a time when many documentaries were being released about Michael Jackson. And a large majority of them weren't worthy of any attention, so I glazed past this one assuming it was like the otherspoorly produced, loaded with inaccuracies,  and an obvious attempt to cash in on the unfortunate demise of thee greatest entertainer of all time.

It wasn't until a co-worker told me about it that it piqued my interest. Sure, me being a lifelong fan, I already knew the things this co-worker was telling me about what he learned from the film. After that, I figured Id read reviews of the documentary online. I was somewhat surprised by all the glowing reviews and ratings it received, so I immediately bought it on Blu-ray.

As it started playing, I knew it was something real when I saw Michael Jacksons mother, Tito, Rebbie, and Michaels friends being interviewed, telling private, personal stories. As I mentioned earlier, Im a huge lifelong fan of Michael Jackson, I know a lot of things and factoids about him, but even I learned a thing or two from this.

With all that said, I must now be a little critical of Life Of An Icon. Its like two separate documentaries in one, with the first half focused strongly on the musical career and talents of the Jackson 5 and The Jacksons. Then once the timeline touches on the beginning of the Thriller album, the entire documentary shifted focus from music career and talents to personal life and tabloid headlines, such as the Pepsi accident, plastic surgeries, medication use, romantic relationships, child molestation claims and trial, while almost completely forgetting about Bad, Dangerous, History, and Invincible. Its almost like two entirely different production teams worked on this documentary.

After finishing the film, I was somewhat surprised by all the glowing reviews and ratings it was given. However, I can also understand why it was given such ratings, as this really is the most comprehensive, most detailed and authentic whole life documentary we currently have about Michael. For that reason, I give it 8 out of 10 stars, or 4 out of 5, as it is good at painting Michael in an accurate unbiased light. I just wish the second half covered more of his music career as an adult as much as it covered the controversial topics, even if it resulted in a playing time of over 3 hours.",1516406400,2,2371,4.787286063569682

It makes you fall in love with Michael all over again.  Every person who speaks in the film has such beautiful things to say about Michael and you can tell that they knew and cared for him.  Michael said that most people don't know him so it was amazing to learn about the real Michael.  The side he was too bashful to show the world.  If only he would've spoken up for himself to the public, I think it would've helped his case.  But he trusted people around him he shouldn't have and had poor self-esteem to stand up for himself.  What a gentle soul that truly was genuine, soft-spoken, innocent, and majorly misunderstood.  It's amazing how much he loved his fans.  I think he needed us more than we needed him <3 Love you Michael!!!! You live in my heart....",1498348800,2,893,4.553459119496855
