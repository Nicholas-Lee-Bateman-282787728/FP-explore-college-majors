8542906,3,B009M1HJFC,"There was a show hosted by Cade Courtly called Surviving Disaster that aired on Spike. I purchased this item after seeing a Cade Courtly video on this item's page. Now, on reading more closely, the item description actually says Amanda Ripley. I think having the Cade Courtly video on this item's page is very deceptive. If I wasn't so interested in the content, I'd be returning the item.",1463788800,,389,4.735294117647059
8542907,3,B009M1HJFC,"While I laud the efforts of Amanda Ripley in producing this video, to me it only felt like an introductory program with part 2 missing. I thought it would offer much more and it just didn't feel complete. What I was looking forward to was suggestions/instructions about what a person should DO to increase their chances of survival in the event of these few prominent disasters. I think it could have been 2 discs and it would have been great. Mostly this video was the personal accounts of people who survived -by luck, and who really didn't seem to do anything in particular to enhance their chances of survival.",1437436800,2,614,4.6422018348623855
8542908,5,B009M1HJFC,"The fascinating psychology of how people behave in disasters.  This book is in my top 10 survival books along with  Laurence Gonzales ""Deep Survival"" and Peter Stark's ""Last Breath."" Scientific, yet very readable.",1427241600,,213,5.424242424242424

8542911,5,B009M1HJFC,This DVD is awesome and I use it as a training aid to teach the psychology of humans in distress and how freezing (deer in the head lights) is part of the OODA cycle and how it must be short circuited. Buy it!,1404950400,,209,3.883720930232558
8542912,5,B009M1HJFC,Awesome!  Worth every penny.  It communicates many view points well.  I highly recommend it for those implementing a risk management program.,1381190400,2,141,5.619047619047619
