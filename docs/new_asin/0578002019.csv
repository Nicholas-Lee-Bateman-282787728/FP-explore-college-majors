2605,5,0578002019,"We ordered Aha Chinese for our 6 year old twins.  The video animation & teaching methods are surprisingly good. Our kids were were very focused - and actually sat still - throughout the entire video. (A first!)  The instruction was easy to follow and totally engaged  the kids.
Aha Chinese really sparked their interest in Chinese culture and now our daughter takes Mandarin lessons in her after-school program.",1260230400,2,411,5.014705882352941
2606,5,0578002019,"This product is definitely one of the best out there right now for learning Mandarin chinese.  My 2 girls (age 4 & 6) love watching the video and actually interact with the characters out loud.  They also ask to watch it over and over because the story is amusing and they enjoy singing the very catchy songs.  The story introduces just the right number of new Mandarin words/phrases and my kids have picked up on them very quickly.  Thankfully, the book and the flashcards have the pinyin pronunciation written for the adults to be able to review the words that were introduced in the video.  We have also been playing memory game with the flashcards that are included to introduce the written Chinese language as well.  If you really want your child(-ren) to learn some Mandarin, while having fun, then this video/flashcard/book kit is for you.",1258416000,12,846,4.760273972602739
2607,5,0578002019,"After using so many different Mandarin educational products from here and China, I must say that Aha! Chinese is the best product on the market today.  The DVD and book really engage my 2 young children and it's easy to follow along. For the beginning student, it introduces phrases and words in a gradual and very logical way.  There is no question that Mandarin will be an increasingly important language to know in our global economy.  In addition, children need to begin learning it at a very young age in order to correctly pronounce the tones.  It's interactive, colorful, and fun while imparting key phrases and concepts in a step-by-step manner. I bought several as gifts for other friends and family who have young children learning Chinese.  Their parents could not thank me enough for finding such a great product.  You will not be disappointed. It's simply the best!",1257897600,2,878,4.859060402684563
2608,5,0578002019,"I bought Guang the Chinese Dragon set for my nephew who just turned 3.  He loves it!  He watched the entire DVD as soon as his Mom put it in the DVD player!  My nephew has quite a vocabulary and is very interested when his aunt and uncle teach him Chinese.  I've looked at many learning materials to give him - books, CDs, DVDs, etc - for children for more than a year, including when I was overseas.  Many of the other learning materials out there are either poorly produced, not very interactive or engaging for children, or they are too difficult for children and their parents to follow, especially the materials developed for native speakers.  Let's Go Guang! is very different - it is engaging, with lively characters - including Guang the Dragon - to capture kids' interest, and uses effective teaching methods like songs, integrating Chinese in everyday activities like cooking with Grandma, and has a variety of ways for children to learn - the DVD story, a book that can be ready anywhere, and flash cards that let children learn at their own pace.  I highly recommend Let's Go Guang! for teaching the children in your life Mandarin Chinese with fun and creativity!",1253404800,3,1175,4.674757281553398
2609,5,0578002019,"As a mother about to adopt a little girl from Taiwan, I found this priceless to not only teach our son currently in our home but also for our daughter we are about to adopt to keep up with her native language. I love the characters, the video runs at a really nice pace and it is an adorable story! I have also found the flash cards included in the kit to be very helpful for our entire family including myself and my husband. We have been testing each other with them, and it has been a very fun game for all of us. I have found in the adoption world very few products that actually help like this with language skills - it has been such a blessing to have!!",1253145600,3,659,4.038167938931298
2610,5,0578002019,I learned about this language program from one of my pre-K students who was speaking Mandarin extremely well and couldn't stop talking about Guang the dragon.  I was delighted with the complete boxed set.  I show the kids sections of the DVD at a time and show the mini-lessons repeatedly since they love the songs.  My students naturally repeat the Chinese as it's presented in the DVD.  The flashcards are really popular with the kids since we play the Memory Game with them.  I've also recommended `Let's Go Guang! Chinese for Children' to the parents of my students as a fun way to supplement our lessons at home.,1252713600,2,617,4.675925925925926
2611,5,0578002019,"This is a fabulous new product! My 5- and 3-year-old LOVE the video and always ask to watch it again once it's finished. They both repeat the Mandarin Chinese phrases as they hear them, and the repetition and use of music in the video really helps them retain the information. Likewise, the CD goes with us everywhere now, and my 5-year-old is able to read some of the flash cards also. The book and parent/educator guide are most helpful in that they provide everything you see in the video in written form. Even if learning Mandarin Chinese is not essential for you, this is a great way to introduce the language to your kids and, at the same time, learn some of the key words and phrases yourself!",1252627200,3,700,4.4765625

Chinese's new multimedia system, which includes a colorful book, fun DVD video, CD and flashcards, is fantastic! Unlike other Mandarin products for children, which focus on only teaching a few nouns per video, this product introduces and integrates useful phrases within an English context so ideas and concepts are mastered in a natural way.  Each lessons also builds on phrases learned in prior lessons.  Using both animation and live video, the DVD holds the interest of young children with songs, games, colorful animation, and cultural lessons.  The flashcards also have Chinese, pinyin and English.  As a parent, I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to share the gift of language with their children.

They started from zero as my husband and I are not Chinese and do not speak Chinese, but after watching this video a few times, they were already saying all of the phrases to each other. They even proudly shared their Chinese to a good friend of the family, who speaks Chinese. As a non-speaker, I especially like this presentation, because the video is in English with Chinese, so my kids (and I) easily followed along with the story. The Chinese was added very naturally and repeated over and over, both in the story, and in cute little songs put to well known tunes like Frere Jacques.

2617,4,0578002019,"At first I was a little skeptical that the DVD combined english with mandarin because I thought that a total immersion DVD is the best way to go.  I was persuaded to buy this set after reading the reviews and giving it a shot.  To my pleasant surprise, after a few minutes of watching it with my daughter (who was riveted), I could see how helpful it was to provide a background of english for those who are being thrown into mandarin with no prior exposure to it.  It puts it into context and understanding.  The repetition and practicing of the phrases allow her to get a number of concepts / words under her belt without being overwhelmed or losing interest because she cannot understand anything going on.  After watching the story of Guang, there's a Making Dumplings with real kids, followed by a section of songs and more practicing.

What is particularly helpful is the audio CD.  We have that in the car and she loves to listen to the story and sing the songs.  This reinforces what she's learned through purely audible means and I think it's very effective.  I especially like that the songs are set to tunes that she is already familiar with.  She loves the songs and can sing all the words to them!!

I know that it might be a little pricey but like the other reviewers said, it also comes with a book, audio CD, flash cards and reference book for parents.  The reinforcement of the words through various mediums is effective.  It helps that I incorporate words into our day by saying ""ni hao"" ""wo jiao ___"" and ""xie xie"" (I just learned these for the first time through Guang!). The entire package is worth the $49.95.  I understand that Volume Two is coming out and we are going to buy that as well.",1298332800,11,1713,4.448717948717949

2621,5,0578002019,I have been sharing Let's Go Guang with the 4 and 5 year olds at my school. The kit is very clear and age appropriate (perfect for 3 -6 year olds). It is very kid friendly and the children definitely like the silly dragon mascot. Good vocabulary and really useful repetition makes this a great introduction to Mandarin for young children. The cooking and cultural aspects also help to make it interesting and well rounded and inspired us to make dumplings in school! I would definitively recommend this kit and am looking forward to the next level.,1291939200,3,548,4.65979381443299

2623,5,0578002019,"As a mother of two children aged 5 and 2, and with limited Mandarin skills myself, I have searched extensively for a good way to ease them into learning Mandarin. For many years I wanted to find a way they could learn some basics in a fun and non-intimidating way that would give them the confidence and desire to pursue Mandarin as a second language.  When I found Let's Go Guang I was thrilled, and my kids love it.  They are extremely engaged by the DVD and ask to read the book all the time.  I even found that after only watching the DVD once and reading the book a couple of times, with a little reinforcement from me, my 5 year old was volunteering phrases he had learned from the kit in completely random situations. The kit really makes learning so much fun and the kids love the characters and story line.  I can't wait for the next kit to come out!",1290384000,6,859,4.251533742331288
2624,5,0578002019,"I think learning other languages is a gift parents can give to those children who are interested. So, I have the Little Pim French CDs and my son watches those with much much interest. I decided to get something different (perhaps more interesting to me???) to expose him to Chinese.

My initial impressions were vey positive. The package that arrived was very professionally presented, with a DVD, a book and some flash cards. However, I am not really interested in the flash cards and the book at the moment as the idea is just to expose my 1-year old to the sounds of another language.

To this end, I think that ""Let's Go Guang"" fails in that ambition. There are so few Chinese words used. Having said that, if this was the first in a series of CDs, where new words are introduced and words from previous CDs are re-introduced, then this might be a wonderful series. Unfortunately, so far ""Let's Go Guang vol 1"" has no follow-up volume II.

I like the singing, I loved the extra footage where you see the chinese dumplings being made. Unfortunately, there was no actual recipe given for the dumplings. I guess that's what the internet's for!

I actually was a bit surprised at how short the DVD was.

This wasn't a cheap DVD but it wasn't excessively expensive for what you get (book, flash cards, DVD). Although I have criticised the small number of chinese words being used, I am not going to return this purchase. I like it, just don't love it. My little boy (and I) will just learn these key Chinese words very well whilst we wait for the next instalment....and we may buy another (cheaper) series in the meantime.

***************
UPDATE: My son is now 18 months old and has really started begging for the Little Pim French DVDs. I have just started giving him Let's Go Guang too. I am very glad that I am not teaching him two languages using the same DVDs. Although he loves Little Pim I think it would be confusing to have the French and the Chinese Little Pim DVDs.

My son seems to like Let's Go Guang quite a lot and I find myself learning quite a lot of stuff passively too. I am very glad that I didn't return this DVD and in fact I have just jumped on to the Aha Chinese website to see if there is a volume 11 yet. Unfortunately no.

He is still too young for the flash cards but I am now looking at the CD of the Let's Go Guang story and thinking he might be old enough for this in the car. Wonder if he'll like it?

This idea of exposing him to other languages is sort of an experiment. So far I am really really surprised at how interested he is in the DVDs I am showing him.

***UPDATE****
My son is now 19 months and now asks for this DVD. He likes the CD in the car too. I also noticed that the other day I had passively learned heaps of the Chinese and could recall it well. Now, I really can't wait for the next instalment. Their website says it's due Fall 2011.",1290297600,4,2887,4.290441176470588
2625,5,0578002019,My son is 2 years old and absolutely loves Guang the dragon. He's already using many of the phrases in Chinese and I repeat them to emphasize learning. i didn't think I would remember the phrases but it comes naturally now. We're ready for more chinese and it's been 6 months since we've had the DVD. Great learning tool.,1288656000,3,321,4.4576271186440675
2626,2,0578002019,"this product is probably good for teaching english speaking child chinese, but definitely not for a child who already understands chinese.

we bought this thinking to give our daughter (16mos old) an alternative dvd movie to watch that's all in chinese. the description said it's in english and chinese, and we thought we'd have the option to choose the language. what we got was each phrase spoken in english, then followed in chinese.  maybe there was a storyline to it, but we skipped through each chapter and didn't notice any storyline.  the making dumpling chapter was mostly in english.

we ended up returning the product, not what we were looking for.",1286323200,6,659,4.90990990990991

Let me say, we are very committed to teaching our kids Chinese and this set has been the perfect way for them to learn about 50 useful everyday words and phrases (not just 40 words!). The pace has been just right for my daughter and fun too!  We read the book together at night, listen to the CD in the car, and I let her watch the DVD on her own.

7788109,5,0578002019,"My kids LOVE Guang!! We have Volume 1 Interactive Kit and Volume 2 DVD, but have since contacted the company to purchase the rest of volume 2 interactive kit contents.

As a mother with MANY language learning tools, I think it is the best language learning method for children (and possibly all people, but I haven't had enough time to review for that) from what I can see. I am very impressed. Fun, easy for them and for me. Gaining a desire to actually apply the language in everyday life is very important to me and feeling comfortable enough to try implementing it in conversation and writing is huge. With Guang it is totally happening in our home.

The following is a list and review of what we currently use, and have used, and what my kids (5 of them: dd 9, ds6, ds4, dd2(yes she talks like crazy and has an opinion)and ds11 mo. (he does catch on and gets excited to watch) say about them:

Rosetta Stone (Chinese and Spanish) Good to learn, but not as fun as Guang.a
Little Pim (German and French) -  I can't hear them and Oh! What does that mean again? Love the CDs though. MOM says: I actually think Pim this is really helpful to very young children who are getting an ear for correct pronunciation which is so helpful in the acqusition of languages. I think they are learning a lot, it just doesn't see to show as quickly. I will be interested to see the fruits of my younger children's language skills from this as they go through their courses in later years.
Journey to the East: River Dragon King - Glad we have it. My oldest likes this best because it teaches more words (she said).
Walker and Ping Ping - Glad we have it. They like this a lot, but wishes it taught more words.

We have enjoyed all of them, but when compared to the instruction and interest of aha! Chinese many only skim the surface.

My 6 year old LOVES languages and writes and speaks Chinese words/characters in place of English when he can in his work. He did this before a bit, but since we have had Guang (our buddy now) it is almost crazy how he naturally implements it into his conversation as they do on the movie. It is very fun to watch the kids discuss it throughout the day and teach me and write me ""love notes"" in Chinese Characters.

Suggestions:
My kids love and pick up so quickly with music. Having a CD/MP3 download of Song and Chants would be so great for them to take anywhere.

More Languages!

Keep up the great work you are doing. I appreciate it and hope you just pop more volumes and products out like crazy. I think this method is wisely put together, especially with kids for whom Chinese is a second language since it helps them make the connections with their native tongue which solidifies and increases learning speed. I can hardly wait until they can watch and understand the entire movies in Chinese. Great approach - hurry!

You should do other languages too. First (French and Spanish)

Both DVDs come in interactive kits which I think are worth the investment. I like the regular size DVD cases for our uses, but the kit contents are so fun for us. I really look forward to having more for us to use from the rest of Volume 2 products and for the other volumes I see coming.

Customer Service was great!

Reviews are rare for me because I usually have little hiccups with products and like to really process before giving my opinion. Five stars are rare for me, but I was so pleasantly surprised I had to make sure others knew. Enjoy!",1382140800,3,3457,4.391236306729264
7788110,3,0578002019,While my daughter does love the DVD I don't think it has taught her much chinese. I would think there should be a lot more chinese language throughout the DVD.

I didn't realize just how much english is spoken in this particular series.  Much like the ni hao kai lan series, there are sprinklings of chinese vocab here and there, unfortunately I don't think it's going to be the way to learn chinese in earnest.
Overall a cute show, but not one to be taken seriously enough to know that your little one is going to actually learn how to communicate fluently in chinese.",1374710400,,511,4.425531914893617

I really enjoyed the DVD, ""The River Dragon King"" which is sold on Amazon, and this multimedia set looked similar and had high ratings so I didn't hesitate to buy it.

I wanted to love this multimedia set and use the flashcards - but the set was a huge disappointment. The majority of the story is in English and it doesn't pepper enough mandarin in.  In addition, they don't repeat the new mandarin vocabulary. The River Dragon King does a much better job of making catchy phrases that my daughter repeats all day.

The idea of having a reinforcing DVD, flashcards, and book is great. However, there is not enough vocabulary and the story is not that interesting.

Ni Hao Kai Lan and The River Dragon King DVDs are much better at reinforcing new vocabulary words.",1371945600,3,911,4.570552147239264

I've learned that if you really want your child to learn Mandarin, you really need to send them to class.",1352592000,,260,4.0588235294117645

A intersting way to learn chinese. Two tumbs up. By the way, you can purchse this from the companys own website to get 20% off the price. You need to pay shipping charge but still cheaper.",1340928000,,340,4.246153846153846
