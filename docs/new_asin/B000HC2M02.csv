In Australia we have a public TV multi cultural TV network SBS. This accesses programs general ratings based channels would rarely show. This TV channel shows a range of non English movies either dubbed or subtexted.

One day along comes this little gem from Germany which unfortunately was only shown twice. I managed to record 95% of the 3 hours plus program and was thoroughly intrigued. This is an Indiana Jones cum Time Travel program which retains your attention throughout trying to work our the paradox of a 21st century artefact found amongst 1st century discoveries. There are two forces maybe bad or good threatening our intrepid young searcher and his friends. Why are they trying to stop him and what do they know?

Its a shame this movie was not released generally because its one of the best of its genre I've ever seen and I treasure the worn out video recording I've retained. Unfortunately the price available is far too excessive and I wish Amazon would get access to this film and release it at a reasonable price. Its well worth $40-$50 but not $110 plus. Come on Amazon. How about placing this one on your shelves.

After completing this review I suddenly noted the program offered at a substantially reduced cost (less than $20). This makes it a very affordable item and I immediately bought it. And boy am I thankful....its as great as I remembered and well worth being in your library.

2633631,5,B000HC2M02,Really enjoyed this movie.  This is a Sci-Fi action movie. Don't expect a documentary.,1263859200,,86,5.142857142857143
2633632,2,B000HC2M02,"This is not just a long movie, it is boring for the most part. It took 3 stints at watching this movie to finish the whole movie. Each time I fell asleep. The story is worth your time and yes the dubbing is off putting for the first 15mins but you get use to that after a while. The female lead is annoying because she alway knows someone who ""does that"" or can help with that, just at the right moment. The male lead is like John Wayne , because no matter what they do to him he is back walking and fighting where most of us would spend months in hospital recovering.

The plot is great and the script is original and refreshing we never get the a final resolve so it leaves the result open. Science fiction only touches the fringes of this movie with the concept that there has been a time traveller from the future who has gone back to the time of Christ and made a DVD. Of course it paints the catholic religion in a poor lightand places it firmly back in the dark ages, poking out eyes, torturing and destroying anything which may prove or disprove the existence of Christ.  So they break the ""shall not Kill"" commandment so often in the name of preserving the faith. In my view, this is a 2.1 star movie and for the script premise and the price it is watchable! Start early in the night or better still during the day so you are less likely to fall asleep.",1262649600,,1362,4.17490494296578
2633633,4,B000HC2M02,A real adventure movie..it may be dubbed (german into english) but at least you don't have to read your screen- the suspense is gripping.  Watch and enjoy..,1239494400,,156,4.777777777777778
2633634,5,B000HC2M02,"A five-star highly entertaining and intriguing movie which combines several elements from science (time traveling), religion, action/adventure
and even romance. If you enjoyed watching such movies as: ""The Indiana Jones"", ""Davinci Code"", ""The Bond Movies"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""Marathon
Man"", ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Time Traveling [Back to the Future, Time
Machine,...]"", you will probably enjoy more watching this one. I highly
recommend this repeatedly watchable film, running over three hours, well
photographed in exciting areas of Jerusalem and other places, dealing
with the greatest story every told - what more can I say. Probably
Spielberg could not have done it better. It is a must for every taste.",1195084800,11,712,5.663551401869159
2633635,4,B000HC2M02,"Ok... first of all I'm not gonna say this movie blew me away, etc. The story is an excellent time -travel sci-fi thriller,  but as far as movie making and quality of the film itself , it's so-so.  The acting isn't too great (ok, though), the production/direction is OK but not what most Americans are used to (huge Hollywood productions).  I liked the story although it wasn't 100% original (sort of a mix of several other pre-existing sci-fi stories.  It is a long movie but the suspense of the conclusion keeps the viewer interested.  It was the story, though, that gives it a 4 star rating.",1172534400,11,593,4.556603773584905
2633636,5,B000HC2M02,"This is a long movie, but let me assure you that it is worth  your time.  Do not let the fact that it is dubbed from German discourage you.  It is one of the better dubs out there.

The main selling point of this movie is the plot.  It is both original and refreshing.  It's not science fiction, although the description might give you that impression.  This is one of those movies that is not easy to categorize.  Even so, there's action, drama, romance, suspense, and comedy.  The basic plot revolves around the finding of an unusual booklet from a 2000 year old burial tomb.  The booklet appears to be the instruction manual for a video recorder.  Given the location and the time period in question, the archeologists concluded that it is possible that this might lead them to a digital video recording of the events that were taking place during the time that the tomb was made.  The location and time being Jerusalem, during the time of Christ.  I won't spoil the plot for you though.

This is not one of those movies that you should watch if you have limited time.  It takes three hours from the start to the conclusion.  But it will definitely be worth it.  I've read reviews of this movie.  They were mostly 3-star reviews, but I took a chance and rented it anyway.  I'm glad that I did. In my view, this is a 4.5 star movie.",1165104000,17,1333,4.389344262295082
8138248,4,B000HC2M02,"Ancient Relic AKA The Hunt for the Hidden Relic AKA Das Jesus Video.

Steffen (Matthias Koeberlin) is having a bad day; first he almost bets bit by a cobra them Fallis in a pit. His days only get worse from there.

Steffen finds a 2000+ year old skeleton clutching a video-recorder instruction book for a device that has not come on the market yet.

Its inference can make you head real. To make things worse is a note with the word Jesus on it.

Now we go through three hours of this reminds me of
""Da Vinci Code cabal,
""The Indiana Jones"" archeology,
""007"" who are you guys,
""Bourne Identity"" who am I,
Time Tunnel here we go again.

I rented this critter sight unseen.

Little did I know it was a German film until I was half way through the introductory titles. Technical German and English are closely tied. This critter has been dubbed and the version I watched did not have subtitles or original language

The reason for the three hours is that they could not afford an editor and left in gratuitous violence and chase scenes; you can easily cut one hour out with a fast forward button and not loose continuity.

I though this might be a hooky religious movie with a Sci-Fi mask. Turns out that it is more of a Sci-Fi movie with religious undertones that do not distract.

An added plus is that even though 2002 was not that long ago all the ancient technology is fun to look at as flip phones and CRTs; did I see some bell bottom pants?",1502841600,,1444,4.338289962825279
8138249,4,B000HC2M02,Very good movie but I was looking for a little more Biblical content. It started out good and it was a good ending. But everything in between was chase scenes.,1467072000,,159,4.333333333333333
8138250,5,B000HC2M02,PERFECT & FLAWLESS TRANSACTION - WOULD USE AGAIN - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER,1464480000,,76,5.416666666666667

8138252,5,B000HC2M02,"Great movie! It is a long movie, but it is worth the time. If you like adventure movies aka Indiana Jones, etc. You will definitively like this one! Highly recommended!",1427068800,,168,4.633333333333334

THEME.",1412553600,,107,4.944444444444445
8138254,5,B000HC2M02,"This is a great movie long (3 hours) .However this is dubbed in English  and is very good job of doing this. The original movie I found is called Das Jesus Movie on Amazon (Germany) this is a 2 dvd however I do not know if any extra's (Might be on 2 dvd 's the movie )
USA version is 1 dvd.
It hold your interest very well and a lot happens in the movie. If you like Indiana Jones you will love this (I do not know why the dvd is expensive on Amazon U.S.A. & U.K.
This movie needs to be on Bluray so how about this guys please do this.
I waiting a long time to get this and I did cheap (2nd Hand on Amazon) and not available in Australia.
DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND BUY THIS",1401494400,,673,3.73943661971831
8138255,5,B000HC2M02,"A great movie that involves Jesus, --- an ancient artifact is a video camera that hasn't been invented yet --- time-travel, and lots of action.
It IS a GERMAN TV mini-series that has been dubbed into English, but you REALLY cannot tell. Excellent production values, but COULD have
been 20-minutes shorter to make a bigger impact... without a bathroom break.",1376179200,,357,4.966666666666667
8138256,5,B000HC2M02,Great concept..a little long winded but a good time killer.  The idea that time travel would be possible and for the reason which at first you think one thing and at the end you get the twist that was cool.,1349913600,,206,4.15
8138257,3,B000HC2M02,"A potentially decent film which is just dragged out with endless episodes of the ""hero"" getting chased, kidnappe, shot at, tortured (mildly), etc.  Then about 20 minutes before the end it becomes rather clear what's going to be the answer for one of the questions in the film.  Other questions either are not that interesting to find the answers to or are not really answered, though implied.  The latter wouldn't be bad except that the answers don't seem to lead to anything relevant as the movie ends focusing on the earlier ""exposed"" answer.  Yeah...I don't want toruin it for anyone by giving the ending points away, but at least 90 minutes of this long film are, as I note, a repetitive series of chasing around with no real advancement of the plot.  So I give it a three for the other 90 minutes which is okay, though I would not watch it again.",1309132800,,851,4.5359477124183005
