8225705,5,B000WUBLUG,"George Shrinks had 40 episodes aired during 2000-2004 on PBSkids as part of KidsBookWormBunch.
The final show aired in mid-2004, though it is still in syndication. However, it ended without a single rerun.

""Because of George's tiny size, even mundane activities, such as working around the house or playing outside, often become dramatic adventures. His primary mode of transportation is his Zooper Car, a multi-purpose miniature vehicle he built with his father that can do things like transform into a submarine or a helicopter. George often has interesting encounters with animals who, although they do not talk, seem to be able to communicate with George throughout the series. On one occasion, he encountered a robotic alien that was his own size, and helped it get back home.

The show affects a retro-1940s look, with simple animation and colors. Primarily jazz is used for background music, reflecting both his father's occupation as a musician who tinkers with inventing new musical instruments and his mother's style as an avant-garde artist. However, statements made in the characters' dialogue imply that events take place in the year 2000, or the year that the showing episode was produced and filmed. The theme song, in a jump blues style, is sung by Canadian blues musician Colin James."" wiki

My kids have LOOOOVEED George Shrinks (born 2000 and 2002)as 5 and under and still even want to ""see it"" today aged 9 and 11.

Be mindful that these dvds can still be picked up individually on amazon even though this one is grouped as a pack of 10. I have not
been able to find the other 30 episodes.

But George Shrinks is amazing and I wish this series would have been kept on PBS by the powers that be and added to with more available for home purchase. There is so much ""junk"" out there, (sometimes even on PBS) and this is quality watching for kids with great morals and can-do thinking coated in bravery, adventure and unconditional acceptance of differences while maintaining great family ties and friendships. Double thumbs up!",1320278400,3,2045,4.915942028985508
