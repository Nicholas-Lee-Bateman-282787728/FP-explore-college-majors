1625549,3,B00005LVWN,"This tv movie starts out very well, staging some frightening bee attacks that are genuinely uncomfortable and scary.  Director Rockne O'Bannon leads Robert Hays, Nancy Stafford, Ryan Phillippe and Dennis Christopher through some sharp moments.  However, once the attack becomes confined in the Hays household, the movie loses its overall steam.  Sure, we care about the family and their plight, but its narrow focus doesn't carry forth the horror of the mass attack possibilities.
Ryan Phillippe is good in one of his early roles, but why in the world does the family put up with him; he's the one who decides to shoot up the primary hives, and then he freezes when he's needed to help out.
Dennis Christopher is cool in his role as the resident bee expert who cheerfully explains bee venom at a packed outside cafe where all the patrons start asking questions.
Not a bad movie, but one I felt could have been better.",1077408000,6,917,4.791139240506329

7945448,4,B00005LVWN,"Made in 1995, this film is good and creepy, but somewhat outdated...we hope. These bees are dubbed ""the killer bees"" mostly because they swarm in larger numbers and are more agressive. The bee expert played by Dennis Christopher from SK's It, does his role with weird credibility. Now, I watched this before The Swarm and many others like it, and was impressed overall. The 'Nightmare' is still possible, but at this point, less likely. The movie seems to exaggerate the reality somewhat...or do they?",1394496000,,501,4.976190476190476
7945449,5,B00005LVWN,"I am trying to find the one Bee movie where all the bees kill the people but I don;t know the name of it exactly however I remember some parts of the movie. See I haven't seen this movie for years ever since back int he 90's when I was about 7 or 8 years old. So please someone help me find this killer bee movie, the right one I seen. I remember seeing a guy with a gun on a farm like growing fruits and seeing a bee hive to shoot at and while he is there is another guy with a pickup truck there driving his way as I remember. Then after all that almost to end of movie there is a little girl who is allergic to the bees stinging her and she needs medical help. Please someone help me find this movie the name of it. I think it maybe this one called Deadly Invasion but not sure. Thanks everyone.",1389657600,,798,3.8719512195121952
7945450,5,B00005LVWN,this movie had a terrific plot.  It was interesting all the way through. Was worth the time and trouble to purchase.,1372550400,,116,4.523809523809524
7945451,4,B00005LVWN,"This is a great movie. I watch it every 6 Weeks or so, that way it stays good.  I collect bee movies & natural disaster movies.",1365292800,,127,3.8846153846153846
7945452,5,B00005LVWN,"The story may seem a little dated today, however Nancy Stafford is excellent as always.  Considering when this was made, and the warning, one wonders whatever happened to the killer bees that were supposed to get to LA in ten years.  Now that Jerry Brown is back as governor they may return.",1289347200,,291,4.576923076923077
7945453,2,B00005LVWN,"I don't really know how to rate this movie.  If I attempt to watch it as the serious film that it was intended to be then it would be a 1 star film.  If I rate it on the amusement I get from watching how dumb the characters are, then it rates a 4.  And dumb they are...  You really must see it to appreciate it.  I swear their IQs drop in half about halfway through the movie.  It's always a good day when I discover that my TiVo has found this movie, but now it's time for me to buy the DVD before this comic gem is lost to time.",1150761600,3,530,3.72972972972973
