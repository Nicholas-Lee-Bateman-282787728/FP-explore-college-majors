8594569,5,B00DMNMAJ6,"I learned this set a number of years ago from one of Master Au's senior students.  Also, I've had the good fortune to work with Master Au throughout the past few years.  He is an outstanding instructor and this DVD further proves that.  His instruction is clear, easy to understand, and this sequence is very beneficial for improved health and well-being. The background knowledge shared is outstanding.  This DVD is very good for beginners as well as experienced practitioners.  If you are interested in learning traditional Shaolin Ch'i Kung, this DVD is a great start.  Thank you for reading and have a wonderful time learning Ch'i Kung.",1411344000,3,640,4.934579439252336
