2692064,5,B000KJU164,the best thing about this dvd is that you can choose spanish audio.  my son loves watching the short episodes!,1357603200,,110,4.5
2692065,5,B000KJU164,"The video is really most appropriate for the 3-5 year range. It is really cute, and my grandson loves it.",1357430400,,105,4.3
2692066,5,B000KJU164,"I grew up loving the Clifford books and have unintentionally (perhaps) projected that love onto my five-year-old girl.  She has been watching these Clifford collections since she was two, and they have carried her through three years of growing up.  The themes and lessons the stories are built around include friendship, trust, asking for help, telling the truth, etc.  What I like about the series is that even though there is a giant red dog as the main character, many of the situations and dilemmas are very real and accessible to small children.  I would watch this even if my little one was not at home :)  We love Clifford at our house!",1310947200,,644,4.663716814159292
2692067,5,B000KJU164,"This is a great addition to the Clifford collection. There are nine stories, and they are as follows: Clifford Cleans His Room * Doggie Garden * Screaming for Ice Cream * Jetta's Project * Clothes Don't Make the Dog * Limelight Fright * Clifford's Cookie Craving * Guess Whose Coming to Birdwell.  The stories in this collection are nice because they deal with self control, judging others, being kind, helping others, self confidence, and asking for help. They are great lessons for Pre-schoolers and are told with the typical entertaining aplomb. My personal favorite is The Clothes Don't Make the Dog, in which T-Bone is given a sweater by his person, and Mac convinces him that he looks silly in it. If your child likes Clifford, he will love this DVD.",1262304000,10,756,4.770992366412214

2692076,4,B000KJU164,"I have a two year old who loves this dvd set. He truly enjoys when he gets to watch this cartoon and its not so bad to hear in the background for me either. The only problem I have with this particular set is the episode where Jetta builds the light house, the other children are really sort of mean to her and by the end the conclusion never really resolves it (as is usually the norm in these types of kids programs, someone learns a lesson). Well this particular episode teaches Jetta not to be a sneaky brat but none of the other children learn why she was so upset to begin with ... hmm I guess its not that big of a deal any-who, I say get the set and talk it through with your little one about why its important to be nice ! All in all, great old show and really very lovable.",1392681600,,783,3.9936305732484074
