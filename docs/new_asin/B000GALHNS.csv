8130110,1,B000GALHNS,"I bought this set with some reservations, having wasted money on another tape from Rising Sun called Richard Kim's Classical Kobudo, which was nothing but some old videos of extremely poor quality evidently filmed while playing on the producer's television.  I don't know whether my scathing review on Rising Sun's website had anything to do with the creation of this set or not, but the majority of Rising Sun's DVDs have suffered from an apalling lack of quality, even those of recent vintage.  This set, however, is certainly a step in the opposite direction.  Tapes nos. 1,2, and 4 each demonstrate four different kata; tape no. 3 demonstrates 5 kata; and the last tape demonstrates three different kata, with a section on basics, which, frankly, is pretty much of a joke, as there is no attempt to teach the proper handling of the weapon, beyond a few explanatory remarks concerning the handling and history of the various weapons, some of which seem to bear no relation to any other research on these tools.  There is also a very brief explanation concerning the nunchaku, which seems pointless since there is no nunchaku kata demonstrated on any of the tapes.  There is also an omission in the description on the advertisement for the tape with the naginata form; this tape also includes the kata Matsu Higa no sai.  From an instructional standpoint, nearly all of the kata are shown three times from two different angles each, for a total of six repititions of each kata - twice at walk through pace, twice at half speed, twice at full speed.  The production quality of each disc is excellent, although on one disc during one repitition of one kata it speeds up for a few seconds, but since the kata is shown six times, it wasn't worth returning the set for that.  Some of the versions of these kata seem to differ significantly from versions taught elsewhere.  I found the demonstrations of Mr. Ricci and Mr. Romanelli to be traditionally oriented, that of Mr. Gaviola somewhat less so, being more appropriate (in my opinion) for the open tournament scene than a traditional dojo. It is also my understanding (based on my research) that the yari and naginata are not part (with some rare exceptions) of the Okinawan kobudo arsenal, and that these weapons are practiced in Japan as part of two person kata, and not as solo kata at all. Even with Mr. Kim's acknowledged lineage, I found these kata to be somewhat surprising.  For my own part, I found the Matsu Higa kata and especially the Techu kata (which has heretofore appeared only in book form) to be very valuable, although it should be noted that their versions of the Matsu Higa kata do differ slightly from some that have appeared on other videos.  In conclusion, I would rate these tapes to be an excellent buy for the breadth of the weapons and kata demonstrated and the excellent quality of the production values.",1165276800,,2883,4.746
