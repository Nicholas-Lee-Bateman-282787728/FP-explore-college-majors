461737,5,6302374340,"This is Dave. David Lee Roth Sytle.  This video melted all the other videos on the shelf.
Califronia Girls.....(remeber the movie that was inspired from this video?  I Know...I know...it was never made.)
And of course ""Just a Gigolo....and everywhere I go..people know that part Daves playin' ""
The video with even more colorful character than the previous! Only right here....on DAVE TV!
And how about them two lovely characters Dave is sandwiched between?
Then the POST Van Halen force of Eat 'Em and Smile Band!!
Dave just pours himself into those videos. ""My doctor said I HAVE TO TAKE A LAXATIVE!!"" ""Not in my store you don't!"" ""Forget about it..."" ""Give me a bottle of anything......and a glazed donut....to GO!!""
And yes yes yes yes YES...going crazy. You have to SEE it to BELIEVE IT!
BUY THIS VIDEO.... Peace Edward...You Must Get Better!",988329600,7,847,4.875

461739,5,6302374340,"Even as old as these videos are, it proves that the last good VH album was ""1984"". For all of his bravado, stage antics and ego, Dave delivers. He understands what rock is, and what rock videos are supposed to  be: loud, fun and full of half-naked women.  That's why we love the guy. We  saw him this last summer (1999) and well, he still can tear it up and bring  a crowd to their feet.  Good luck Eddie, you and your aging, heroine  infested joints and your lying, whining, over-inflated ego can fade into  obscurity, we'll stick with Diamond Dave.",952732800,6,550,4.3861386138613865

7825570,5,6302374340,"Who needs Van Hagar when you're the most famous frontman in Rock N' Roll??  This is a great collection of early solo Diamond Dave.  It would be nicer to have a few of his later vids on an updated DVD, but for now, fire up the old VHS, sit back, eat 'em & smile!",1205884800,,261,3.814814814814815

7825573,5,6302374340,"The Music Video can be a beautiful art form. For those who don't believe that, they have never seen David Lee Roth's. While California Girls will always be my favorite video of his, I loved Yankee Rose. It was an over the top slap to the face that must have left Eddie's jaw hanging wide open when he first saw it. Unfortunately the gas ran out all too soon and Dave is little more than a 'where is he now' subject on VH1. As much as I'd love to see a true Van Halen reunion, I've accepted a long time ago that it just ain't gonna happen. Look what happened when they were on the stage together for two minutes at the awards show. You expect them to put on a string of concerts? ha ha.
This video, for all it's worth, displays the talants of one of rock's greatest frontmen. Rock on Dave.",1080345600,2,788,4.123376623376624
7825574,5,6302374340,I love David Lee Roth...I had not seen these videos since the 1980's. I ordered it and when I recieved it I stuck it in the vcr and laughed for at least 30 minutes. Roth gets us to laugh at ourselves ...David Lee Roth is a Class Act and if you don't appreciate this man and his videos and music then in my opinion your already 1 foot in the grave.,1016323200,4,347,3.9014084507042255
7825575,5,6302374340,"I LOVE THIS TAPE! I've had it ever since it first appeared in my mid-teen years and have since worn thin some seven copies of it I've bought since! The only disappointment is that the rest of Dave's videos from later albums were never released as a follow up collection as we had all hoped (""See ya on the NEXT cassette!!!""). No doubt if Dave had had his way, we would have gotten ALL the videos out by now...
But QUICK! Somebody PLEASE make a DVD of it! I'm salivating to get it in a version I can't wear thin! PLEASE! It's too cool, too funny, and simply too much FUN to not have in DVD format!!!",1014595200,5,598,4.119658119658119
7825576,5,6302374340,"This is a fun video that takes most of us back to the 80's, and MTV, when it actually showed videos. Diamond Dave directed, choreographed, and flat out made up most of the wierd characters in these strange, but hilarious videos. Just a gigalo pokes fun at MTV and stars like Boy George and Motley Crue. California Girls is like a peek into the mind of Roth, and Yankee Rose and Goin Crazy are proof that Dave did not need Eddie and Alex to be a star. The cool interviews with Dave and the bikini girls between the videos are fun, and its like talking to Dave, were you to see him at the beach. While on vacation in Vegas, I actually asked one liquor store clerk for a bottle of anything, and he gave me a quart of Cuervo...""That'll work!""",996883200,16,738,4.24113475177305
