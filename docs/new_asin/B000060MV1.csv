1681837,5,B000060MV1,"This windup to the first series of Holmes & Watson on Granada TV brought it all to the ending Conan Doyle wanted, at Reichenbach Falls. Since this was the best pairing of Jeremy Brett's defining Holmes and David Burke's excellent Watson, it is almost a shame that, like Doyle, Granada continued with the additional, later, tales with an exhausted Brett, slowed and puffy from illness, and a very able actor (whose name escapes me) as Watson who is, nevertheless, less satisfying than Burke in the role. Ah well.
The Resident Patient has Holmes solving a strange murder that turns out to be a case of delayed justice of a sort, rough justice though it may be.  It's okay.
Then we get to The Red Headed League, which is a mystery that at first Holmes' takes lightly but soon realizes has deeper implications.  The most important aspect of the story is where it leads...to Professor Moriarty (deliciously played by Eric Porter who gets my vote as best Moriarty of all!).
This, of course, takes us to The Final Problem.  Tired of Holmes, Conan Doyle wanted to end the stories by killing-him-off.  However, he told this tale with just enough ambiguity to leave the door slightly ajar.  By popular demand, he had to kick it open again and bring Holmes back.  The tale of The Final Problem is told well here, faithful to the story, and with enough detail to make the final confrontation inevitable and believable.
One watches the two tales of Holmes versus Professor Moriarty and one is struck at how such a archetypal character was created with just a few deft strokes.  Moriarty is only in the two tales and only briefly and yet the legacy of the character can be seen in the James Bond villains, Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse, the Deaf Man (with tongue firmly in cheek) of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct, and even Hannibal Lecter.
The Evil Mastermind will continue to be with us in book & film, and it was a real inspiration to pick Eric Porter for Moriarty.  He has the slightly disheveled and disreputable look of a brilliant gentleman gone to seed.
The 5 stars are for Sherlockians, of course, and for Jeremy Brett's brilliant capture of Holmes high-strung, imperious, and restless intelligence.  The quality of the DVD's is lacking but this is all there is and the stories are worth it.",1024358400,3,2275,4.681704260651629
1681838,5,B000060MV1,"As always a command performance by Jeremy Brett, the ultimate Holmes. All three mysteries in this series are of course well done and enjoyable.

1681839,5,B000060MV1,"This DVD contains the last three episodes of the Adventures of Sherlock Holes series. As usual, the acting is wonderful and the setting is full of period flavor. Jeremy Brett in particular has really outdone himself in his portrayel of Holmes.
Of course, even the weakest episodes in the series are still a pleasure but the three on this DVD are surely some of the best.
The Resident Patient: Holmes is called on to investigate when the only crime seems to be a minor intrusion. However, things change when there is an apparent suicide. This episode delves into definate Poe territory with its opening nightmare sequence. The banter between Holmes and Watson is very good.
The Red-Headed League: I freely admit that this story was one of my least favorites since I was forced to read it three times in school. However, the adaptation is very good and I was forced to rethink my dislike. Holmes is once again called to investigate what seems to be a non-crime. A mysterious League of Red-headed men forms and vanishes inexplicibly. The episode also features our first glimpse of Holmes's arch-foe, Moriarty. Not according to the book but an understandable addition.
The Final Problem: Any Holmes fan knows what this story entails. To those who have never read the books, I shall say that the series closes with a real bang. Mariarty tires of Holmes's interference in his criminal affairs and goes on the offensive.
The show ends on a literal cliff-hanger and as I write, there is yet no word on when the Return of Sherlock Holmes will be released on DVD. I do hope it is soon since I am ready for more!
There is a complete DVD set of the entire series available. However, if you, like me, have been collecting the DVDs as they come you will find this disc a worthy completion of your Adventures set.",1023148800,5,1798,4.6572327044025155
1681840,5,B000060MV1,"on the final 3 episodes of Granada/PBS first series.  ""The Resident Patient"" features Patrick Newell formerly ""Mother"" of the last season of The Avengers as a former bank robber hiding out from his old comrades who suspect him of keeping all the money for himself, as a resident patient to a doctor just out of medical school.  ""The Red Headed League"" shows a gullible old man who unknowingly is a pawn while his assistant is tunneling under his place of business to rob a bank of French Gold.  This case introduces Eric Porter as Holmes' archenemy Professor James Moriarty.  Although he appears a lot in radio broadcasts and movies, this and the next are the only printed short stories he appears in.  It is implied that Holmes has been trying to implicate him in many crimes however.  Sort of Holmes : Moriarity :: Steve McGarrett : WoFat for you Hawaii Five-O fans.  In ""The Final Problem"", Holmes and Moriarity have their final showdown.  This episode marks the last appearance of David Burke as Watson.  When the series comes back with ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes"" and the first episode ""The Empty House"" Edward Hardwicke (son of Sir Cedric) will take over.  But I am getting ahead of the story......TO BE CONTINUED!",1018483200,9,1224,4.758293838862559

These adaptations are nearly flawless and faithful to the original text.  When I was young, I watched this series, delighting in Holmes's dry wit and keen intellect.

1681842,4,B000060MV1,"Once again a pair of brilliant performances by Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes are slapped onto DVD with a few stingy extras.

1681863,4,B000060MV1,This was a strange one. I didn't see the way the story line was going. That is unusual for me. I usually can figure out the story line prior to the turn where it is spelled out for you.,1352505600,,185,3.769230769230769
1681864,5,B000060MV1,"I bought this DVD because Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes hums at the beginning of ""The Resident Patient"" a piece of Beethoven that I love to hear; however I can't remember what it is called.  ""The Resident Patient"" is a story wherein he does not have a role in the solution.  That is always fun.  It is really great to see him rushing around to follow the clues, but in the end he rushes through the door and his jaw drops down to his stomach.  You can just see his mind going ""Oh Darn!""  Sherlock also plays the violin very vigorously at the end of this episode.

Unlike the short story that Conan Doyle wrote, the TV producers used ""The Red-Headed League"" as a means to introduce Professor Moriarty.  Don't hold it against them!  It works!  TV is different from a short story.  This was a really silly case.  It must have been done for Holiday time or an economic downturn.  It is strictly for laughs; except for when Moriarty shows up in the last scene.  Just because it is funny doesn't mean that you should leave it alone.  One has to have a sense of humor. Even Holmes and Watson think that the facts of the case are hilarious.

""The Final Problem"" is really great.  It is done as if one is preparing for a funeral. Could be.  Who knows.  Poor Holmes takes a beating in this one. It also seems like he might be on vacation in the Alps.  But who is that snake in the grass?  But how can you tell what happens when there are no witnesses?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Sherlock-Holmes-Vol-5-The-Resident-Patient-The-Red-Headed-League-The-Final-Problem/dp/B000060MV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 5 (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)</a>",1256428800,2,1767,5.006872852233677
1681865,5,B000060MV1,"Two of the very best episodes of this series.
I read the Sherlock Holmes canon for the first time only last month. Where was he all my life! I was so taken in by the stories' cleverness and style that I just had to have the Granada TV series. There is no one else like the young Brett as Holmes and it is unlikely that anyone will try to do the entire series again.
The later episodes in the series run from good to hideous, but it's not really Brett's fault. When he had control over Holmes, the results were ideal. But the later films show him a mere caricature of the real Holmes. At least Hardwicke remained constant as Watson.
 Regarding these two shows, I don't know why Moriarty was dragged into the Red Headed League. It really isn't necessary, and it implies that Doyle's story is somehow inadequate as written. I find this to be my favorite of the Holmes stories, and the casting in the TV version couldn't have been better. The only other nick I have with it is that when Holmes knocks on Wilson's door and the fellow who has been digging in the basement comes out, his knees are very obviously wet, but there is no evidence that he was on his knees in dirt. I found this rather odd, but it is a minor issue.
As for The Final Problem, I was spellbound all the way through. I felt that I knew Holmes and Watson well by now, and they were old friends. When Holmes and Moriarty fight it out at the end, we all know what will happen. And when they finally went over the edge, I was in awe. The way this was done on the limited TV budget was marvelous. I've never seen a scene of this type that was so effective.
Then, as they continued to fall, I kept waiting for the freeze frame, showing them dangling in space - as well as in the viewer's imagination - for all time. What an excellent memory that would have been! I believe it would have gone down as one of my favorite TV scenes (of which I have few).
But when they contiued to drop and drop, well past the cut off time, I started to get worried, and finally I was appalled when they both - as represented by two obvious dummies - hit bottom and bounced off the big rock.
I just sat there cold, wondering how the HELL they could ruin a perfect scene like that. We all know what really happened to Holmes. Why did they show this? If they would have left it dangling, it would have made a perfect segue into The Empty House. I can't imagine why they chose to run to this. I know that in the book it is so, but things changed with Doyle after he finished this story, and if he had been thinking of more Sherlock in the future, I think he might have left them both dangling too.
But this is a mere quibble. That's the way the story is, and that's the way they chose to film it. It is still one of the best of the series. How sad that Brett didn't get to finish all of the stories his way (I understand that this was his intention).",1214870400,,2888,4.129662522202486
1681866,5,B000060MV1,"+++++

This DVD presents three of the 50 minute Sherlock Holmes' episodes that had Jeremy Brett as Sherlock and David Burke as Dr. Watson.  Each episode is based on a story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930) who wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Sherlock Holmes.

(1) ""The Resident Patient""  (12 scenes; based on the 1893 story).

A wealthy man in ""a state of mortal dread"" sets up a practice for a struggling doctor in his home.  Later, the wealthy man is found dead in his home.  Was it suicide or murder?  Sherlock investigates.

(2) ""The Red-Headed League"" (12 scenes; based on the 1891 story).

A businessman gets a second lucrative job because he satisfies the condition for employment: he has red hair.  An episode that's hilarious at first (check out Sherlock and Watson laughing uncontrollably) but later turns more sinister.  The quotation by Sherlock that is the title of this review comes from this episode.

(3) ""The Final Problem"" (12 scenes; based on the 1893 story).

What can I say about this riveting episode?  There's a unique ""meeting of masterminds"" at 221B Baker Street.  Check out the thrilling ""Final Solution"" at the end of this episode that may spell the end of Sherlock.  Eric Porter as Professor Moriarty does a fantastic job in this role.  A must-see for all Sherlock Holmes' fans.

Brett (who made 41 Sherlock Holmes' dramas between 1984 and 1994) is in top-form in these episodes since they were made before the time of his health problems.  He captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performances.

The costumes, background music, and especially cinematography are quite well done.  In my case, I found the picture quality and sound quality for this DVD to be almost perfect.

Finally, this DVD has 3 extras.  I found these interesting.  Newcomers to the series should especially enjoy them.

In conclusion, be sure to view this DVD and see why it won a 1988 Swedish Academy of Detection Award!!

(1984;  150 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)

1681867,2,B000060MV1,"The shows were wonderful.  Good suspense and I love Jeremy Brett--the best Sherlock out there.  But in 'The Final Problem' they had a nude ""art"" scene with a woman.  Come on, this is just not right, why would they ruin the movie with that?!

1681869,5,B000060MV1,The best Holmes and 3 shows.  In the last three you get introduced to Moriarity and see Holmes death(maybe).  It was decent quality for a almost twenty year old show.  My only problem with the series is that there are only 2-3 episodeds per disc and the bonus section is pretty bare. I would like to see some improvement for the casebook of sherlock holmes but I still cannot wait.,1036368000,,381,4.414285714285715
1681870,5,B000060MV1,"Personally, I can't take seriously the old Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies -- although Rathbone was a competent Holmes -- because Nigel Bruce played Dr. Watson as a buffoon. In the books, Watson was not a bufoon but rather an educated, intelligent man, and the fact that Holmes' thoroughly surpassed him simply helped to indicate Holmes' genius. In my opinion, it is essential for Watson to be portrayed correctly for a Sherlock Holmes adventure to be correctly done. In these adventures David Burke played Watson to perfection -- the finest portrayal of Watson ever done, in my opinion -- and thereby enhanced Jeremy Brett's reputation as an outstanding Holmes. These three adventures of Holmes and Watson are among the finest ever made.",1035676800,,744,5.10655737704918
1681871,5,B000060MV1,"Once again Jeremy Brett and David Burke bring their wonderful portrayals of the great Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to the DVD screen in volume 5 of this wonderful BBC ""Mystery"" TV series.
Consisting of 3 adventures, the latter 2 feature Holmes' classic confrontation with that ""Napoleon of Crime"", Professor Moriarty.  Played chillingly by Eric Porter, Moriarty proves to a classic opponent to Brett's edgy Holmes.  David Burke, who would leave the series after these episodes, provides Watson with warmth and wit.  While the classic confrontation of ""The Final Problem"" episode would leave Holmes' fate in doubt, there is no doubt that this is TV at its finest.  A must-have for Holmes fans and highly recommended.",1029110400,2,717,5.155172413793103

If you've found your way to this page, no doubt you have already heard of or seen this series, and need no convincing on whether or not to buy it.
So, I'm just taking this minute to write and express my sincere appreciation for how good Vols. 1-5 are.  Holmes & Watson were the original 'buddy cop movie' pair.  I love how Watson continually tries to impress Holmes with his own deductive logic based on Holmes methods.  Even as Holmes dismisses it, a smile creeps across his face, and Holmes admits ""although...your conclusions are not entirely false...""  Watson is not only Holmes only friend, he is the truest a friend can be.  When danger looms, Holmes glances at Watson, reminding him that he doesn't need to put himself at risk.  Watson, of course, gladly accepts any task while reaching for his revolver.  Holmes eye catches a gleam, and he replies ""excellent.""",1027036800,,1097,4.647668393782383
