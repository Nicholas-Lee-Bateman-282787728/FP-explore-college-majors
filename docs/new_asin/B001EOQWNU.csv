8607863,5,B001EOQWNU,"This is SO much fun!  Who knew a DVD could do so much?  So user-friendly, no bits and pieces for my daughter to lose, just a DVD with I think 12 games all played with your remote and presented by Hannah's 'BFF', Lilly, which makes it really cute.  There are several games that get them up out of their seats and performing which is a must for me ... a Charades game which is really fun (and I can join in too with that one), sing along, dance feature, clips, trivia, friendship games.  Moms, if you want some peace and quite, stick this on, and your kids (girls AND boys) will be mesmerized!!!  A great Christmas gift to keep them busy over the break.",1228262400,5,651,4.217741935483871
8607864,5,B001EOQWNU,"I've got to say that this game is fun to play even if you are not a Hannah Montana fan.  My goddaughter has just received this DVD as a birthday gift, and since it was her birthday, the whole family played it with her.  There is a section where people play in teams, and act out words or draw things and have their teammates guess the answers.  Even the guys in the group gave it a try, and we all had a lot of fun. A really clever game!",1228176000,2,437,3.8876404494382024
8607865,5,B001EOQWNU,"I purchased this DVD last week, and I am very pleased with the product.  It
provides a wide variety of games and activities to play as a family.  You
don't need to be experts on Hannah Montana to have a good time.  Guaranteed,
quality entertainment.",1227398400,2,249,4.488888888888889
8607866,5,B001EOQWNU,"I received an advance copy of this game and my daughter and her friends played it for 2 hours straight.  We also got the High School Musical DVD game, which is really good too.  If I hadn't gotten them in advance, I would buy them for stocking stuffers.  Great music with singalongs and dance alongs and lots of trivia about the tv show!",1226707200,2,337,4.317460317460317
8607867,5,B001EOQWNU,"I just went to Miley's Sweet 16 birthday party at Disneyland and I got to try this game before it came out in the stores.  It looked really cool on the monitor, so I wanted to see if it was any fun.  I did the trivia game, which had a bunch of diferent types of trivia questions.  It was way better than the other Hannah Montana DVD game that I got a couple of years ago that had a game board.  That one was really boring.  This new game has lots more stuff on it, like games you can play alone or games you can play with groups.  I learned a dance routeen and sang along to Nobody's Perfect and it was really fun.  I wanted to buy this game when I was at Disneyland but they said its not ready until November, so I am totally going to buy this game when it comes out.
 I finally got my copy of the game and it is SO much fun!  (I got the Season 1 Hannah Montana DVDs also!)  I recommend this game to ANYONE who likes Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana!  It is definitely worth the money!",1223337600,2,984,3.919191919191919
