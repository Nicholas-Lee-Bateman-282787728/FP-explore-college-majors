5339840,5,B009INAC12,It was an enjoyable and funny movie.  I really am glad I bought it.  I have watched it quite a few times and highly recommend it.,1362528000,,129,3.923076923076923

5339842,5,B009INAC12,"What a charming, heartfelt completely winning movie. Eric Mabius and Brooke D'Orsay have wonderful chemistry together, their practice kiss made me swoon. And Kathy Najimy is hilarious as the best friend. I was so happy to see this came on DVD after seeing it on TV. This sweet flick hands down beats a lot of theatrical romantic movies I've seen lately. If you are looking for a great rom-com - look no further. This is it.",1360627200,,423,4.578947368421052
5339843,4,B009INAC12,"To my shame - for I am a manly man - I find myself hooked on the Hallmark Channel. To offset those times when I'm out chopping wood or whittling with my Bowie knife or recaulking stuff, I sometimes take my ease by taking in diverting romantic comedy films like 2012's HOW TO FALL IN LOVE. Eric Mabius and Brooke D'Orsay star in this one and you're probably having the same reaction I did: ""Who the heck are they?"" I had never heard of Mabius & D'Orsay - they sound like a French magic act or an occult detective agency - but it's okay. We navigate thru what could've been a pedestrian narrative made exceedingly watchable, thanks to fine performances by Mabius & D'Orsay. Or if we don't care about hurting Eric Mabius's feelings, thanks mostly to Brooke D'Orsay.

The plot revolves around a painfully shy accountant who hires a dating coach to help him gain self-confidence. Except that this fledgling dating coach, Annie Hayes (D'Orsay), turns out to be the same girl on whom Harold White (Mabius) once had a crush years ago in high school. Harold, back during his formative years, was a social misfit. And, distressingly, Harold has never outgrown his awkward teenhood. It's depressing when your local waitress greets you with this sort of familiarity: ""Let me guess. Table for one, right?"" So that's Harold's plight. He makes Rainman seem like a wild bon vivant.

Not that the ""dating coach"" has got her sh-- together. Annie Hayes is an event planner by day, but times are lean, and so she supplements that by waitressing. Annie by nature is happy-go-lucky and seems stuck in inertia and relies on her older sister's good graces. Except that her sister has dropped an ultimatum. She wants Annie to move out already. To further supplement her low income, Annie offers to be Harold's dating coach, never mind that she'd never done this before. And either Harold is a soft touch or he's still smitten with his high school crush, because he hires her.

Come the eight lessons on dating, spanning germane topics such as ""gaining self-confidence,"" ""breaking the ice"" and ""the art of conversation."" And as Annie reshapes her client from a cripplingly shy wallflower into a self-assured bachelor, are you so surprised that she begins to develop feelings for him? It turns out, there's more to Harold White than endless social mortification.

HOW TO FALL IN LOVE holds no great revelation. It's another modern spin on Pygmalion, this time with a gender reversal. I feel that this is more a vehicle for the immensely appealing Brooke D'Orsay. She shines as the rudderless young woman who gradually comes of age. She provides the vitality and the personality. And maybe it's because I'm a guy, but it seems to me that Eric Mabius's character, even when finally having achieved ""hunk"" status, still comes off as bland. He makes Lawrence Welk seem daring and hip. But I approve of Harold White's taste in music. Props to him for championing the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett and Deano. And I really enjoyed the interactions between Mabius and D'Orsay (""Mabius & D'Orsay - Your Upscale Haberdashers!""). This is a predictable movie, but sweet and a lot of fun. It provides a welcome change of pace from blacksmithing and beer brewing, manly pursuits which always wear me out.",1360368000,90,3275,4.801418439716312
5339844,5,B009INAC12,"My older son is a hopeless romantic & when he saw this on the hallmark channel, we thought we would never be able to get it on dvd. So this has been a treat for him as a gift. Thanks!",1359763200,,183,3.6
5339845,4,B009INAC12,"This is a favorite of the recent Hallmark Channel offerings.
Here is a guy who, though a successful and creative adult, can't see himself as anything more than the awkward, geeky teen of his younger days. He is attracted to a woman that he sees in a coffee shop regularly, but hasn't got the self-assurance to approach her. Encouraged by a friend, he goes to a dating coach, which turns out to be not such a good idea.
Enter a ghost from his past--one that has never stopped haunting him. This ghost is a young woman he knew in high school. We have already witnessed, in flashback form, his painful encounter with her at a school dance. She now seems oblivious to his angst over their former acquaintance. In fact, she can't even remember that they had gone to a dance together. But she needs to find work, and when Harold confesses to still being socially inept and mentions his failed attempt with a dating coach, she decides that is a job she could take on.
Her goal is to help him learn how to approach and successfully date the woman in the coffee shop, and she takes it on with all of her might!
This may be a typical ugly duckling story, but it is done with creativity and humor and I found it very enjoyable. The characters are endearing, and it is a delightful journey to watch the unfolding of Harold's confidence and the development of his coach's awareness of who it is she is coaching. This is a fun movie!
And for all the parents out there--the romantic relationships presented in this movie are never inappropriate for family viewing.",1359504000,3,1549,4.49645390070922

But it was hard to watch something so dumbed-down and badly acted.  One of the first things I found difficult was the woman's whiney voice, which grated on my nerves throughout the film, like fingernails on a blackboard.  I also found her character to be so shallow that I couldn't imagine ever wanting to be in the same room with her for very long.  It's sad that the message is that if you look like she does, any man would be attracted.  Ugh!  The Hallmark films are generally using B-quality actors these days and recycling old plots.

*may contain spoilers*

Harold is an awkward fellow with vivid memories of his awkward teenage years, and the girl that broke his heart. Harold is an easy going, simple, and quite man who works as an accountant and has a passion for photography. He's quite content being the shy, but lonely guy until his well meaning friend Willie suggests that he find a dating coach to help with his crippling awkwardness with women.

Annie was the carefree, popular, pretty girl in school. The girl who every guy fawned over. She was so busy having fun, she didn't see the hearts she broke. Annie is all grown up now, but is still carefree....restlessly jumping from one career and one relationship to the next. She leaves the city to come back to her hometown and live with her married sister and her family while she tries to save her money up to start an Event Planning venture. In the meantime she gets a job as a waitress in a diner and counts her pennies as she's desperately trying to pay her bills....and repair her car that is on the fritz.

 Annie's sister Claire, reintroduces Harold and Annie at Annie's niece's birthday party. Harold awkwardly greets Annie and remembers vividly the dance they attended together as teenagers, while Annie struggles to put together just who this guy is.
Annie runs into Harold again at work, when she mentions that her car is broken down and she doesn't have ride home. Harold shyly volunteers to drive her home after her shift.

Annie is blindsided when Claire gives her an ultimatum. She needs to grow up, she needs to move out. Annie realizes she needs to make more money and fast.
Once Annie discovers more about Harold, his awkwardness and Harold's well meaning friend Willie's attempts to help him with a failed meeting at a match maker, Annie hatches a plan to help Harold becomes a heartthrob all the while helping her money situation out. Annie becomes Harold's teacher in all things romantic. She starts to bring Harold out of his protective shell and Harold gains new confidence in himself.

Annie's work is a success and Harold is a changed man, a heartthrob. But Annie might have lost her own heart in the process. Harold, even though more confident, still doubts himself when it comes to Annie....and may miss his chance at true love.

I adored this movie from start to finish. Harold's bumbling ways were so endearing. He has a soft but steady voice, being thoughtful and true to himself even as his appearance changed a bit and his confidence rose. Annie was an out of the box thinker in this movie and pushed Harold to try things he might be to shy to do on his own. I think the characters complimented each other very well in their personalities and that's what made this work so well. Eric Maibus played his part of Harold very convincingly and so sweetly that you really felt bad for the guy and just wanted to hug him through some of the more tougher parts. Brooke D'Orsay was fun and carefree in her portrayal of Annie, but also very kind hearted.
I love how this story unfolded and especially loved the eccentric character Kim that Kathy Najimy brought to this movie. It's a wonderful movie that I can watch over and over again, never getting tired of it!",1406851200,8,3479,4.574638844301766

It has a cute premise that the guy is the unexperienced one in dating and the girl has all the experience.  It also involves a storyline on my favorite hobby of photography.  The acting is great and there is a good rapport between the two main characters.  My husband and I have a bit of a longstanding joke about Hallmark movies which is that the story develops along and then somewhere in the last one to three minutes, there is the ""KISS"" that seals the deal and ends the movie on a happy note.  Fortunately there is a very sexy kiss in the middle of this movie that just prolongs the enjoyment of this film.

When the list is complete, the guy is transformed a bit, but he already had what it takes. So when the numbers added up, the one and one made two for romance. This is a great film.

The female protagonist is vibrant and tender-hearted and I really liked the guy as he was a decent man who needed a little assist in mastering his social skills.  They had been high school classmates so there was a foundation upon which was built a really solid relationship.

I bought ""How to Fall in Love"" because it was only $5. I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it. Actually I loved it. I've watched it twice already. The geeky teenage version of the male lead in the beginning of the movie really makes you root for Eric Mabius's character throughout the rest of the movie. You just really want things to work out for him. Brooke D'Orsay, the female lead, was super cute and a believable actress, although I haven't seen her in any other movies.

It has two of my favorite actors- if you watched Ugly Betty you recognize Eric Mabius (Daniel Meade) as Harold White and if you watch Drop Dead Diva you recognize Brooke D'Orsay (Deb Dobkins) as Annie Hayes. Together the actors feed well off of each other. Though this is a Hallmark Channel Movie (I know usually they are kind of cheesy!) I fell in love with the plot and characters. I watched this on television twice in one day when I was home sick and ended up purchasing the movie because I loved it so much. It is completely family-friendly, but also really great for a girl's night movie pick for a romantic/kind-of-comedy/feel-good movie. If you are in to romantic comedies that are a little bit cheesy but also really sweet this movie is right up your ally (its like a lower-budget romantic blockbuster).",1384905600,2,840,4.6066666666666665

The whole boy meet girl story is thrown in by having this guy meet the girl when they were in high school. Then, years later, they re-meet and he hires her as a dating coach.

Now, you know it coming, but you keep watching to see it, when they both fall in love with each other. Oh yes, you know it by the cover only! So, after they start having their dating coach seasons, they start really loving each other, but neither of them really want to admit it. This is because the whole point is for the guy to find another girl to date. So, it is not possible for the main guy or main girl to love each other, while the guy is trying to find love with another girl.

Again, you know it coming, and it will come when the fall out happens that the two main stars will love each other.

5340372,4,B009INAC12,"I tend to approach Hallmark romance films with trepidation, however, when 2 actors that I thoroughly enjoy (Eric Mabius and Brooke D'Orsay) are the leads, how can I resist? Eric Mabius and Brooke D'Orsay do not disappoint.  They are adorable as the stereotypical opposites attract couple.  Annie's self analysis and growth really impressed me, probably more than Harold's story. I also think the 8 lessons that Annie teaches Harold are decent advice and definitely won't hurt any relationship or individual.

I found the dramatics with Annie and her sister, Harold's hoped for girlfriend, and the dorky best friend too much the cookie cutter Hallmark supporting cast.  I would have liked it better if they had toned it down a notch.  I knew that Harold was not going to end up with Julie, I didn't need her to overact her obnoxious behavior to get it.

So go into this one knowing that it does fall into the category of sappy TV romance shows.  However, enjoy it for the 2 well acted leads and the sweet story of growing into a more whole person and moving forward in life, wherever that takes you.",1376956800,,1098,4.717277486910994

And she really gave great pointers.... I should use some of her pointer to the next guy I date.",1370131200,,305,4.169491525423729
5340402,5,B009INAC12,"This is the perfect movie for all those who were ""bullied"" in school.  This is also a good movie for anyone that
""bullied"" other people in school.  This movie provides a ""good feel"" for those bullied in life who feel like they will always be labeled a ""nobody"".  Your life really can change for the better!  Now for those who ""bully"" other people, perhaps this movie can hopefully make you realize the negative effect that your actions have on other people.  This is a great ""feel good"" movie!",1370131200,,493,4.556818181818182
5340403,5,B009INAC12,"Possibly one of my favorite movies.  I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). How to Fall in Love was really quite clean.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

Every time Harold White asks a woman out it ends in disaster. He still suffers from an ""ugly-duckling syndrome"" in his youth that has haunted him ever since.  He thinks that he hasn't changed all that much.  However, Annie, the pretty/popular girl he knew and had a crush on in high school (who he asked out once and she didn't pay much attention to) meets him again and wants him to hire her to be his dating coach (and help him gain some self-esteem).  It is very cute how Annie draws Harold out of his shell and teaches him about who he is and who he wants to be.  Lesson #1: Self-Confidence. Lesson #2: Breaking the Ice.  Lesson #3: The Art of Conversation.  Lesson #4: Start Sharing.  Lesson #5: Make Her Feel Special.  Lesson #6: Getting Close.  Lesson #7: Compromise.  Lesson #8: Follow Your Heart.  She thinks she is helping him to ask out the girl he has seen in the coffee shop, but Harold still likes his ""teacher"" and as Annie gets to know her ""student"" better, they find that they like their lives so much more with each other in it.  And they would like to keep it that way.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1369785600,33,1615,4.2947019867549665

This is what most of us have been waiting for.  A movie that provides total entertainment without any bad language, no sexual innuendoes, and has a great ending.  Can you imagine a movie with a great ending for a change?  This one has it all.",1368057600,2,265,4.36734693877551
5340407,3,B009INAC12,"If you're looking for great cinema, head to the next aisle, there's nothing here. On the other hand, if you're looking for a nice romantic comedy, you've come to the right place. Harold White (Eric Mabius) is a flop when it comes to women, so his best friend convinces him to seek a dating coach. After being turned off by the one his friend suggested, Harold ends up giving his high school crush, Annie Hayes (Brooke D'Orsay) the job. What follows is a predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable, series of life lessons.
The chemistry between D'Orsay and Mabius sizzles and the relationship between teacher and pupil is delightful. Oh, and there's good solid wisdom in Annie's lessons, to boot!
All in all, it's a fun Hallmark movie. Enjoy!",1367884800,20,737,4.811023622047244

5340410,5,B009INAC12,"A good, clean, fun movie. Another Hallmark Channel / Giam hit. A make over from nerd into dashing wonderful man--is a bit worn as a plot, but it really worked well in this story.",1367107200,,178,4.264705882352941
5340411,4,B009INAC12,It was an ok movie. The storyline was very predictable. The actors were great. The main characters were from Ugly Betty and Royal Pains.,1366934400,,136,4.708333333333333

5340433,5,B009INAC12,"How to Fall in Love was an enjoyable movie because I,  too, was extremely shy when growing up.  I could see  myself being very awkard during the beginning stage of dating.",1365552000,,171,4.451612903225806
5340434,4,B009INAC12,"As the saying goes ""you can't tell a book by it's cover"".  Annie seems shallow at first.  Popular in high school.  She's desperate for a job and her high school classmate, in his 30's, who is still awkward dating needs a dating coach.  Dating coach concept introduced to him by a friend.  He hires Annie, helps him evolve out of his shell and as he becomes very attractive to the opposite sex, Annie starts seeing all his great qualities and predictably falls for him.  In the end her talent as a party planner is realized.  It has some depth regarding family relationships too.
It's a feel good, fun predictable movie with a message to teens as well as people in business.  Don't overlook the shy, quiet people.  They may have the lasting inner qualities that matter in a relationship/business.
Recommended for people who like wholesome movies .  No bad language, no sex.",1365552000,2,872,4.677631578947368
