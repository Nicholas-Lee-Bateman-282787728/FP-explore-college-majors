8436851,1,B004NUUPKI,"I bought this movie last week and I wannted to cry,because I wasted my money. It was to much yelling and screaming you couldn't hear none of the bad actors. The story line was good,but the camara man was terrible you would have thought a 5 year old was holding it. The zombies looked like regular people. Dont waste your money folks.",1355184000,2,333,4.387096774193548
8436852,4,B004NUUPKI,"It was a little slow to start, but it was a more realistic depiction of human behavior in a disaster than any hollywood 'thriller'.",1352246400,,131,4.5
8436853,5,B004NUUPKI,I totally enjoyed this film. For those who like zombie movies this gives a very fresh and entertaining perspective on the genre. Well done!,1350432000,,139,4.833333333333333
