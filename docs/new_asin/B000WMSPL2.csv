The first point of comment would be the acting, which I personally found quite engaging, and realistically written, like a conversation you would have in the living room. The effects were impressive, very reminiscent of Plan 9 From Outer Space. Watching this with my family provided us with untold hours of entertainment. Overall, this movie met my expectations; however, the acting from one actor, Dale Lyles, seemed rather stilted, so my review will not be 5/5. If this one crucial factor is amended in future releases then this score will go up.",1518998400,,651,5.037037037037037

First, the movie was made in 2006, and the CG effects could have been done better by an amateur level designer for a FPS mod. The set was somebody's basement? More likely an attic, and I believe that with a little effort, the set could have been made look more professional. A good example that it CAN be done is the fan film ""Star Wars: Revelations"".

That said, after the first 10 minutes or so of amazement over the poor CG effects, I started to find the movie oddly captivating. The plot evolves as a human-like alien, who is involved in some sort of interstellar war, is randomly displaced 100 light-years right into Mars orbit, where he encounters the much-inferior earth exploratory spaceship Journeyman. A first-contact situation, but the Journeyman has no time to dwell on this fact, because the displacement by the rift may not be so random after all, and there is a risk that Earth could be drawn into the war.

The plot now continues at a fast pace, eventually revealing other factions of the war, but always leaving a sense of mystery. The Journeyman's crew is kept more than busy dealing with the new technological and civilizational information that is thrown its way, leaving one key question open, why are those aliens so human-like?

At some point watching this movie, the poor CG and the attic-character of the Journeyman bridge became totally irrelevant to me, because not only was the storyline development breathtaking, but the actors really did an amazing job for an amateur crew. The characters are highly likable, foremost those of Jin and Sid Shubian, not to forget the quirky chief engineer Rudy. When the main opponent, Tuka, appears, the viewer keeps wondering if friend and foe are really what they appear to be.

At this point, I have to agree with the other review. Plot and character development, witty and humorous dialogue, and several mysteries that are kept unrevealed left me yearning for more. I should also mention the dramatic music by Ellsworth Hall, which  accentuates the atmosphere of the movie -- a major plus.

A sequel has been announced, and I can't wait to watch it.",1375488000,,2187,4.803191489361702

From reading Jules Verne from when I was 10 till today. I am a total scifi fan.  I have read a lot of scifi, and I have seen most scifi films, but his one was.... beyond description.

Imagine filming you family in your basement to make a scifi movie with cardboard sets.....

Sorry, I could not sit and watch the whole thing. It was a huge disappointment.",1331856000,,370,4.242857142857143
8411046,5,B000WMSPL2,"Rarely does one come across an independent film that lures you in so strongly that you don't want it to end, but Shubian's Rift is one of them.  Unfortunately this one had to come to an end, but I was left staring at the screen wanting more, wanting to know what happened next and would our heroes survive.  The story is expertly put together, intertwined with excellent character and plot development.  Taking place in Earth's near future, the plot centers around a growing conflict between two civilizations (living on their own planets) that's ready to burst into an all out war.  The big mystery is why.  That's where our Earth crew of the ECC Journeyman come in.  The crew's captain, Shubian, is tasked to find out why, and what implications it has for Earth's peaceful existence.  Little by little through the action and witty dialogue we are given hints as to what is really going on.  Even at the very last 10 seconds, we are given the final clue, being left with our deductive reasoning to figure it out.  This is a story of mystery, political intrigue and a reflection of society on a grand scale with a sci-fi background.  Hats off to director and writer, Dwyer.  With an excellent cast of actors, I sure hope I get to see a sequel-SOON!",1195516800,,1248,4.576576576576577
