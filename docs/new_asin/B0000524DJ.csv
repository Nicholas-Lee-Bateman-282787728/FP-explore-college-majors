7929755,3,B0000524DJ,"I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  It had the potential to be quite good, but ""missed"".  I thought it was in English, but it is Cantonese/Mandarin with English S/T, not in itself bad if the documentary had been good.  Mainly, it is various martial arts scenes from Jackie's Lo Wei film period (c. 1975-1978).  The scenes are very good, all wide screen so you see everything.  However, the Chinese commentators have tried to be ""clever"" and linked the scenes with a fake ""story"" on Jackie's training in various styles of kung fu.  If you know the films the scenes are from (and I have seen them all) this type of treatment becomes very irritating.  It could have been done so much better (ie. a REAL dissertation on Jackie's unique development of combination of various styles of martial arts and comedy).  Not a bad DVD, if only for the opportunity to see some brilliant martial art action in wide screen, but not a must see for Jackie fans.",1007337600,7,948,4.568047337278107
