ECW Championship:
CM Punk (Champion) V. Elijah Burke
good match, not as good as their Judgment Day match. Nothing too special in this one. Punk retains. **1/2

WWE Tag Team Championship:
Matt Hardy & MVP (Champions) V. Deuce N' Domino
More of a can you top this between MVP & Hardy than a wrestling match. It actually made DND look bad. They are bad, but it made them look worse. It was good to watch, but that's about it. **1/2

No Disqualification Match for Carlito Only:
Triple H V. Carlito
Damn idea for a match. It would have been better if it was No DQ for all. It still was a good match, but it could have been alot better. Triple H wins of course. ***1/4

WWE Women's Championship:
Candice Michelle (Champion) V. Beth Phoenix
Better than what I thought it would be. Again, nothing really noteworthly with Candice retaining. *3/4

Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:
Great Khali (Champion) V. Batista V. Rey Mysterio
Actually a hell of alot better than what I would have thought. Mysterio made it watchable and some good storytelling it in. Again, nothing to make this match really stand out, but still good. Batista regains the title. ***

World Tag Team Championship:
Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (Champions) V. Paul London & Brian Kendrick
Good match, but again, nothing to special in it. Just you normal tag match with the champs retaining. **3/4

WWE Championship:
John Cena (Champion) V. Randy Orton
Abother good match with the same theme. Nothing special. It was a brawl from start to finish, the ending was extremely dumb, but it had to set up the Last Man Standing Match. Orton wins by DQ. ***1/4

Undertaker V. Mark Henry
good match, but yet again, nothing special. take comes back and beats Henry. **1/2

Overall, nothing special. rent before buy, unless you are like me and want ever PPV.",1216252800,,1897,4.741641337386018
8161286,3,B000LC3ILA,"Unforgiven 2007 wasn't a bad PPV per say, it just wasn't as exciting as previous 07 PPVs.

A bad idea of this PPV was to have a non title match as the main event. Yes I know Undertaker returned from his injury but so did Triple H and Rey Mysterio at Summerslam and they didn't get the main event. Although, with the way the WWE Title match turned out, maybe it was a good idea after all.

Another strange factor was that every single match was under 12 minutes long, with the longest match being the opener at 11:52. This is pretty bad for a PPV. Rundown:

ECW Championship Match: CM Punk (champion) vs Elijah Burke
This was the longest match on the card, and also the opener. I also forgot Elijah Burke even had a title shot back then. But this was a decent match, with lots of good moves and it shows both men can wrestle. A decent match. (3.5/5)

WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Matt Hardy and MVP (champions) vs Deuce & Domino (w/ Cherry)
The whole selling point of this one was to see Matt & MVP's chemistry and how they worked together. At times this match was rather funny with Matt and MVP trying to outdo one another. Very entertaining and the right people won too. (4/5)

No Disqualification Match for Carlito only: Triple H vs Carlito
Another very entertaining match with only Carlito gaining the No DQ stipulation, he could use any weapons he wanted while Triple H wasn't allowed to. But this meant Triple H had to be sneaky with his weapon use. This made for a very funny match, seeing how Triple H managed to get away with cheating. An amusing match and one of the better ones of the night. (4/5)

WWE Women's Championship Match: Candice Michelle (champion) vs Beth Phoenix
Beth dominated this match which Candice won with a fluke pin. But Candice has improved so much and did manage to hold her own against her much larger opponent. This match continued their storyline and made both women look strong with Candice keeping the title and Beth being pinned out of the blue. (3.5/5)

Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship: The Great Khali (champion) (w/ Ranjin Singh) vs Batista vs Rey Mysterio
This match was a waste of time for Rey mostly as he was vastly outmatched by Khali and Batista, he hardly got any offence in. The match was all over the place and the only good thing to come out of this match was that Khali lost the title. (2/5)

World Tag Team Championship Match: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs Paul London & Brian Kendrick
I love any match with London & Kendrick in it, since they're immensely talented and it was great to see them in a title match since being drafted to Raw. This match was pretty good too, tag team wrestling is underrated, as this was a gem of a match. Loads of great moves, good teamwork, a good ending. Above average match. (4/5)

WWE Championship Match: John Cena (champion) vs Randy Orton
As much as I love John, this match was rubbish. It was one of the shortest matches on the card and didn't live up to the hype. It was nothing like their awesome Summerslam match. It was just to further the storyline with John's father. John got DQed after 7 minutes, then let his Dad kick Randy in the head. (2/5)

Return Match: The Undertaker vs Mark Henry
This was a bad main event. They could have found somebody WAY better for Undertaker to wrestle in his return match. Mark Henry? Are you joking? That man is a horrible wrestler. It was great to see Taker back, but this match was bad. Taker's entrance was longer then the match... (2/5)

Overall, this PPV wasn't too bad, it just had a few too many lacklustre matches and most of the matches were too short.",1216166400,,3624,4.442771084337349
8161287,4,B000LC3ILA,"Tonight The Undertaker returns and he will show no mercy.

ECW Championship match
Eligah Burke vs CM Punk

I really liked this match. The both of them started out slow in the beginning. It really picked up towards the middle. It ended out of nowhere but this was still a good match.
6.5/10

WWE Tag Team championship match
MVP & Matt Hardy vs Duece & Domino

This was an okay match. It really felt like a match that would happen on smackdown but hey. Both MVP and Hardy trie to showoff to each other through out the match. The both of them made this match watchable and plus I like MVP so this was alright. 6/10

Triple H vs Carlito

This match was a no dq match only for Carlito witch made it interesting. This was done pretty nice. It wasn't like a street fight match at cyber Sunday but good. Carlito was hitting Triple H with a lot of trash cans and lids. I wished it would have been a little more hardcore but still good. 8/10

WWE Women championship match
Beth Phenoix vs Candice Michelle

Beth has been on raw only for a little while and she gets her shot at the gold. Again this was an okay match. It didn't really look like a squash match here. Candice showed off some moves while Beth  dominates the match. Good match. 6/10

Triple Threat match
World Heavyweight match
Batista vs Rey Misteio vs The Great Khali

Khali dominated most of the match. Batista did his usual things while Rey looked kind of helpless. You know it picked up towards the end witch was a nice ending. Even though the only part was good was the ending but it was still preety good. The crowd went crazy when Batista won. 8/10

World Tag Team Championship match
Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch

The crowd for some reason was quiet. I thought it was preety average. London and Kendrick showed why they were the longest WWE tag team champions because the both of them were good. 7/10

WWE championship match
John Cena vs Randy Orton

Boy was this horrible. I was really mad about this. It wasn't wrestling, it was more like ""I'm going to get you Randy, I'm going to make you pay"" thing. Horrible. 4/10

Mark Henry vs The Undertaker

The Undertaker makes yet another cool entrance. It was really slow but it was okay since it was takers first match back. So it was cool. 7/10

This ppv was okay but I was dis appointed with the WWE championship match.",1197849600,,2362,4.366132723112128
8161288,3,B000LC3ILA,"ECW Champion CM Punk vs. Elijah Burke - You already knew how this match was going to do once you see that they didn't even bother to show Elijah's entrance.  Anyways, this match surpassed their Judgment Day match in that it wasn't too slow that it got boring with the mat wrestling between each other.  A good opener but don't blink or else you'll miss the ending.

WWE Tag Team Champions MVP & Matt Hardy vs. Deuce & Domino - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches in that Hardy & MVP trying to show up each other thoughout the bout by doing blind tags, doing each other's moves & taunts better, and Hardy pulling the same actions on MVP that he did when they won the tag titles. Taking the match for what it was intended to be, it was entertaining.

Triple H vs. Carlito - The stipulation for this one is that Carlito couldn't be disqualified.  This match was entertaining by the fact that Triple H doing Eddie Guerrero-like cheating behind the referee's back such as pulling the hair & ropes during an abdonimal stretch while Carlito kept getting the advantage by using weapons like the ring bell & trash cans.  Just like the previous match, it was more about being entertaining than wrestling...which it was.

Womens Champion Candice Michelle vs. Beth Phoenix - This match was about Beth completely overpowering & dominating Candice thoughout the match and even yanking out Candice's hair at various times.  Candice scored the quick fluke pin.

World Champion Great Khali vs. Batista vs. Rey Mysterio - The only part of this match that was worth watching is the finishing sequence where Rey did two sets of 619's on both guys followed by a springboard onto Khali before Batista powerbombed Rey onto Khali & hitting Khali with a spinebuster & winning the title.  Skip the match and watch the instant replay afterwards, that's the watchable part of this match.

World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London - Good tag team match here between these four.  London & Kendrick didn't tone down or lose a step since coming to RAW as they showcased their daredevil style while Cade & Murdock show why they brought back as much credibility as they can back to the tag team title scene on RAW in the previous month with their brawling & mat based offense.  This was my favorite match of the night.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Randy Orton - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" segments because the match ended by DQ after seven minutes when Cena just wouldn't stop beating down Orton & moved (he didn't shove the referee or barely even touched him) the referee twice.  That match was good for what it was in that seven minutes but it was a crappy ending.
Ironically, this was Cena's last PPV match for months as he got injured right before the next PPV.

Undertaker vs. Mark Henry - Boy, Taker knows how to go all out on his entrances.  The match itself wasn't much as it was just the image of Taker pulling off his moves against such a huge man like Henry that was the sight here.  This doesn't pass their WrestleMania 22 match but the match is watchable but nothing special past Taker returning.

The only DVD extra worth mentioning is that you see Taker's exit where he's lowered back down at the front of the entrance way.

Overall, this is a DVD worthy of a rental as eventhough the main events were duds...the undercard ranged from good wrestling (World Tag Team Titles & ECW Title) to funny & entertaining (Triple H/Carlito & WWE Tag Team Titles).  I would recommend this for a rental.",1193011200,4,3549,4.55748031496063
8161289,4,B000LC3ILA,"Here's the review of WWE Unforgiven 2007.

1st Match: CM Punk vs. Elijah Burke; ECW Championship (6 out of 10 )
The match was pretty good. These two are outstanding athletes showed off their skills in this match. It's kind of sad that the ECW Championship had to start off the show. Burke mostly dominated this match. The ending was made Burke look really bad. After Burke dominated this match, it had to end in a roll up. Otherwise, good match
Winner & Still ECW Champion: CM PUNK

2nd Match: Matt Hardy & MVP vs. Duece N' Domino; WWE Tag Team Championship
(7 out of 10)
This match really surprised me. The storyline is developing between Matt Hardy & MVP. Both men continued to try to see if either could top that. Duece and Domino held up their bargon but let's face it, these two are horrible. I'm a heel lover but these two are just horrible. Their gimmick and in-ring skills are very boring. I'm saying that MVP & Matt carried this match but it still was a great one.
Winners & Still WWE Tag Team Champions: Matt Hardy & MVP

3rd Match: Triple H vs. Carlito; NO DQ for Carlito Only (5 out of 10
Anyway back to the match, this was just a long squash match simple as that used to make Triple H look unstoppable and put Carlito over as.....well who knows what Carlito was being used in this match for other then look like a pathetic jobber to Triple H. Every single offence Carlito did without a weapon in hand he was manhandled beaten by Triple H easily, even with weapons Triple H either took the shot as if it was a slap to the wrist or again easily got out of the predicament. For one example Carlito throws some white powder in Triple H's eyes and for any normal man this would blind you for say a minutes, not Triple H 5-10 seconds later he is back at full vision and dodging a chair shot then nailing the spinebuster on Carlito. Now as for the finish I don't know if the low blow ending was to try and save some face for Carlito, making it out as if Triple H needed to cheat to win ora possible heel turn in the near future but either way the match was a RAW match best because it had no real competition from Carlito at all which really annoys me.
Winner: Triple H

4th Match: Candice Michelle vs. Beth Phoenix; Women's Championship
Much better then I had anticipated, I thought this would be quick below average match for the Women's Title. But it was quite a good match, Phoenix has some great strength and ability in that ring and she really impressed me, after seeing this match I know she is what the WWE need to base a new and improved Women's Division around, hopefully she becomes Champion at No Mercy and the WWE can try and mold a better Women's Division around her because with TNA's Women's Division starting up soon the WWE will be under pressure to move away from the looks department and focus on talent and Beth has that ""IT"" factor to give the Women of the WWE some credibility again. Beth dominated the match and really the match was used to get Phoenix over at a larger scale by facing the Women's Champion, Candice did her bit she has improved talent wise in the ring but still not believable as the number 1 Women on WWE programming in my opinion. Finish again was a roll-up but for this match I didn't mind, since there was no way Candice was taking her down for the 3 count.
Winner & Still Women's Champion: Candice Michelle

5th Match: The Great Khali vs. Batista vs. Rey Mysterio; World Heavyweight Championship (7 out of 10)
Now I'm going to start by saying I didn't expect much from this match at all because you had The Great Khali who cannot wrestle to save his life, Batista who as we have seen over the past few months doesn't have good matches with Khali and Mysterio who cannot do many other moves against these two opponents apart from his quickness. But I was certainly wrong again, the match was great HEAPS better then I thought it would be. Khali might not be a good wrestler but his promo squashing watermelons, however lame it was left me in awe and he plays the huge giant so well with his actions and moves. The first turning point from Batista and Mysterio against one another was to my surprise Mysterio, I think this was a better choice because no one expected Mysterio too do on Batista first.
The ending was great with the double 619 by Mysterio and then Batista breaking up his pin on Khali, then interesting enough he choose to take out Khali rather then Mysterio. Now this could be that yeah he just wanted to get the monkey off his back by beating the Champion, or maybe this is a small signal that he may turn heel down the line. I still think Batista would benefit from a heel turn in the next few months, but either way I'm glad Batista won because even though I may not be a fan of him he is a step up from Khali, and with Mysterio moving more naturally and freely in this match means better matches for Smackdown which has been lacking the past few weeks. But on a final note I found it very intriguing that Triple H was backstage to congratulate and send abit of a message to Batista after he won the title, Triple vs Batista?
Winner & New World Heavyweight Champion: Batista

Note: IMO, I think Batista is the most overrated star in the WWE today. Since Wrestlemania 21, It's been Batista in all the Main Events and horrible wrestling. At first he was doing well but after his injury, he hasn't been the same.

6th Match: Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs.  Paul London and Brian Kendrick; World Tag Team Championship (7 out of 10)

The started off a little too slow in my opinion, it would have been good for London and Kendrick to start off the match with a flurry to get the fans caught up in the match and hyped up for the win. Now Cade and Murdoch have never really done anything for me and the fact that they are the top heel tag team in WWE really does say something about the division, WWE need a strong heel tag team to get some interest in the tag team matches.
The match started to get better towards the end when London and Kendrick started their fast paced athletic moves and then Cade and Murdoch with their power moves did well for the match. I think this is an actual good feud for RAW to get both teams more interest and credibility if they keep putting on matches of this class or above. One man who did really impress me though was Lance Cade, I didn't know this guy could wrestle as good as he did tonight and he certainly shocked me with how good he can be, I see a good singles future for this guy in his career.
Winner & Still WTTC: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch

7th Match: John Cena vs. Randy Orton; WWE Championship (4 out of 10) Waste of time! I was really expecting a great match. The match was just a brawl until Cena was DQed. I just have nothing else to say about this match
Winner by DQ: Randy Orton

8th Match: Undertaker vs. Mark Henry (7 out of 10)

First, The Undertaker entrance was captivating. You have have to see it! The match was pretty good. This really made up for the last match. The match was decent for a Henry/Taker match but nowhere near as good as their Casket Match at Wrestlemania 22. Undertaker looked good in the ring which is a great sign for Smackdown, now with Batista as Champion, Mysterio back and better then ever and now Undertaker back and looking good in the ring Smackdown is going to get much better in the next few weeks I can guarantee it.
Never expected Undertaker to lose this match but after that awesome Chokeslam from Taker and Henry kicking out of the pin, I thought maybe he had a chance. This is a big difference from Triple H's match with Carlito, where you never expected Carlito to pick up the win. At least with Taker he can give you a nice even match no matter how big, small or tall his opponent is.
Match wasn't great but the fact it was Undertaker return match got me hyped throughout the match, and even though there was a faint ""TNA"" chant in the crowd during Henry's attack. It was a decent match, Main Event quality of a PPV? No, but that is where WWE's booking of match orders comes into play. Nice way to end the PPV on a high, rather then with Cena's match, and leaves a good question in your mind.
Winner: The Undertaker

Overall: All in all a decent PPV not as bad in my opinion as others I have heard from, I wouldn't say this is a PPV to order and pay to see but if you can get a hold of it then you might as well check it out. Nothing really special throughout the show that you could write home about, just a decent PPV that had nothing special but did what it had to do. I would buy the PPV but it's not a memorable PPV.

1. CMP vs. Elige Burks for the ECW Title- This was an okay match to kick off the show. I felt a little different because I don't ever remember a big title match to kick off the ppv. This was refreshing for ECW since the past 4 months had been matches between CMP and John Morrison on ppv. Elige Burke looked good in this match and so did punk. A little slow at times but the match time was given enough time to develop Good match. Winner and still ECW Champ CMP. Match Rating 7/10.
2. Matt Hardy and MVP vs. Duece and Domino for the WWE Tag Team Titles- This was a unique tag match since Hardy and MVP did not like each other and they had a feud going. Those two reminded me of Beniot and Angle when they tagged cause they hated each other and also tried to one up each other. Just a solid tag match that kept the feud going between hardy and MVP. Winners and still WWE Tag Team Champs Matt Hardy and MVP. Match Rating 7.5/10.
3. HHH vs. Carlito in a Hardcore Match- This was a decent street fight. It gave you more of an old school feel as there was not any blood and not as many weapons. The problem I had with this match was I already knew going into this match that HHH was going to win so that sucked. Besides that a decent street fight but it could have been better. Like I said some more weapons and blood would have made it better but not that awful. Winner HHH. Match Rating 7.5/10.
4. Candice Michelle vs. Beth Phenoix for the WWE Womens Title- I will say this was a pretty good womens title match. Once again like the CMP vs. John Morrison feud it was nice to see a new women and a new match besides Candice and melina which were horrible. Beth Pheniox looked really good for her first ppv match. Not great cause it was mostly dominated by Beth Pheniox but better than I thought. Winner and still womens champ Beth Pheniox. Match rating 4/10.
5.  The Great Kalhi vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Batistia for the WHT in a triple threat match- This was my favorite match and my match of the night. That's right when this ppv started there was no way I was picking this for match of the night but it turned out to be pretty good. These three men worked really well together as you had power vs. speed factor. Rey added to the match with his speed. Aslo this was a tough match for me to predict so it kept me on the edge of my seat which was good. There was a nice chair shot by Rey and tons of false finsishes which added to the match. Great Match. Winner and new WHC Batistia. Match Rating 8/10.
6. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London for the World Tag Team Titles- Well for me this match was not as good cause we had just come off that title match. It seemed like this was palced on the card to cool the crowd down as we have seen this match before. These guys tried but I was not as interested in this as I should have been. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. Match Rating 7/10.
7. John Cena vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title- Well this for me is when the ppv goes down hill. This is the match that ruined it for me. First off coming off a good summerslam match I was expecting just as good of a match or better and it did not happen. Second the booking by wwe is awful not putting this as the main event is one of the worst decisions ever keeping mark henry in a main event. I know why cause they used a DQ ending and they did not want to piss the fans off well tell you what you pissed me off just as bad not putting it in the main event. A lot of people would say the reason they bought this ppv was to see randy orton vs. cena and the biggest match is ruined. The match itself was going ok but the thing that is rediculos is cena would not brake a count of the ref and he DQ him. He did not hit him with a chair he would not brake the count total crap. On top of that the crowd must have been livid as this. I was also sick and tired of Cena winning every ppv. It makes me not want to watch wwe anymore with the same old booking. On top of that yeah cena has been putting on great matches but not every match is great for him against orton and kalhi he gets 5 moves in and wins. I am sick of it and this ruined the ppv for me. Winner by DQ Randy Orton. Match Rating 2/10.
8. Mark Henry vs. Undertaker- Well we saw this before and I will say that this match was worse then there mania match. These two tried here it was good to see taker back. There was a couple of near falls but overall a horrible choice for the main event. Great to see taker return though and this should help smackdown. Winner Undertaker. Match Rating 3/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Unforgiven 2007 a grade of 46/80 which is a 57% which means this is an awful ppv. I would not say that but that is the way my scale works out. I will be honest though the cena and main event ruined this ppv. I am not kidding there are average matches but not something that you should pick up trust me save your money maybe no mercy will be better. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1190332800,2,5152,4.049019607843137
8161291,4,B000LC3ILA,"Here are my predictions for Unforgiven 2007. It is shaping up to be and okay card, but not enought to make me purchase the PPV. Again, WWE drops the ball on what they could do. Granted they were hurt by the suspensions from the steroid ring, but they could add a gimmick match to get a higher buyrate. It is complete with anticipated match order and anticipated match rating.

1. Cade & Murdoch (vs) London & Kendrick (World Tag Team Championships) -I believe this match will open the show to get the high flying team of London & Kendrick the opportunity to get the crowd going. I expect this to be a decent opener. I look for Cade and Murdoch to pick up the win after cheating. I anticipate this fued to contiune after this PPV. Winner: and still world tag team champions - Cade & Murdoch (7.5/10)

2. CM Punk (vs) Elijah Burke (ECW World Title) - I do not agree with putting this match on the PPV. Let Punk relish in his win. If they wanted to get an ECW match on the card, put on Boogeyman/Big Daddy V.It is just rushed in way too much. These two could possibly get a great fued going, but they will not be given enough time here. I expect it to be a very short match. Look for this fued to continue for a while: Winner: and still ECW Champion - CM Punk (6.5/10)

3. Candice Michelle (vs) Beth Phoenix (Women's World Title) - Ummm...who cares. Winner: and new Women's Champion - Beth Phoenix (4/10)

4. Matt Hardy & MVP (vs) Duece & Domino (WWE Tag Team Title) - The outcome of this is a bit intriguing. I am really torn in this match. I don't see Hardy & MVP being champs for a while, but I don't see them losing just yet. I think the title will stay on them for a little while,while WWE keeps tabs on the heart of MVP. I anticipated MVP trying to cost the champs the title, but Hardy somehow finds a way to win the match for the team. It should be entertaining, but nothing too special. I am hoping to see a 2 out of 3 falls match or Ladder Match for the U.S. Title between Hardy and MVP. Winner: and still WWE Tag Team Champions - Matt Hardy & MVP (7.5/10)

5. The Undertaker (vs) Mark Henry - We get another long awaited return of The Undertaker. Obviously the intro will be awesome. I don't think this match will be as bad as it looks on paper. These two put on and entertaining match at Mania 22. Of course, they don't have addition of the casket match. I think it will be okay. I think this will be the end of Henry in the WWE. I believe his contract is up real soon. I cannot wait till he is gone. Hopefully the match will be short enough to keep the crowd in it. Winner: The Undertaker (6.5/10)

6. Triple H (vs) Carlito (No DQ for Carlito) - This is a very intriguing stipulation. I personally think that this match would have been good without the stipulation, but it does indeed add something to it. I am a strong supporter of Carlito. I just hope the WWE actually uses the stipulation to make it somewhat like a Street Fight instead of just run ins for Carlito. I anticipate the ref getting knocked out and Triple H using chairs and the sledgehammer. Should be a very good and very entertaining match. I expect Carlito to perform well here. If he does he could be pushed even closer to main event status. Probably will be the second best match of the night. Winner: Triple H (8.5/10)

7. The Great Khali (vs) Rey Mysterio (vs) Batista (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat) - I think the addition of Batista was a smart move. I think the match will be okay. It will be interesting to see how Batista and Mysterio mix together in the ring. Should be somewhat entertaining. Look for a lot of near falls on Mysterio. I actually expect to see Mysterio get the pin on Batista. I think this will set up a Punjabi Prison Match between Khali and Batista at No Mercy and a title match between Mysterio and Finlay at No Mercy. Winner: and new World Heavyweight Champion - Rey Mysterio (8/10)

8. John Cena (vs) Randy Orton (WWE Title) - Should be a very emotional match. The crowd will be in it from the get go. Cena will almost look like a heel in this match as he will be very intense. I expect him to go crazy and lose his mind in the match. I expect it to be paced very much like there Summerslam match. I again see the ref getting knocked out and both men cheating to win. I see both men bleeding as well. My prediction is that Cena will get Orton to tap through the FU, but will refuse to break the hold resulting in a the referee changing his decision and giving the match by DQ to Orton. I see these two going at in again at No Mercy will the stipulation will be the title can change hands on DQ. I see Orton losing that match by DQ and then the two of them again going at it again at Cyber Sunday in a viewer's choice match (Hell In A Cell, Street Fight, Cage Match). The match will be Hell In A Cell and Orton will win the match. But, as far as the Unforgiven match goes, it should be very entertaining and crowd pleasing, minus the final decision. Winner: Randy Orton by disqualification (8.5/10)

So there you have it. Those are my predictions. If done right the PPV could actually be better than it looks. It will definately set up future fueds nicely.",1189900800,2,5172,4.221435793731041
