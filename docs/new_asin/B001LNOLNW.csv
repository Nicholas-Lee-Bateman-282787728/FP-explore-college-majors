8319248,3,B001LNOLNW,"Released in 1978, Trauma (aka Red Rings of Fear, Rings of Fear or Virgin Terror) is a murder mystery starring Fabio Testi as a Detective who investigates a murder at a Catholic Girls school in Rome.

The protagonist is effective with his Hollywood good looks. My title blurb describes the movie as Dirty Harry in Rome because its reminiscent of those 70s flicks, although it naturally has a European flavor and theres no subplot about the detective being disillusioned by the libertine politics manacling the police force. This was the third film in the 'schoolgirls in peril' trilogy, the first two being What Have You Done to Solange? (1972) and What Have They Done to Your Daughters? (1974). The big reveal at the end made me bust out laughing. Why Sure!

Unfortunately, the editing is amateurish, like a lot of 70s low-budget Euro flicks; its just awkwardly done and takes you right out of the movie. Movies like this make you praise Hammer Films in all their low-budget glory. Also, this DVD (which is probably the only form of the movie available) has terrible audio  and I could only make out about 50% of the dubbed verbiage; no kidding.

An Italian/Spanish/German production, the film runs 78 minutes. It was directed by Alberto Negrin from a script by Massimo Dallamano (amongst others).

8319249,3,B001LNOLNW,"Who is murdering all the pretty young girls? That is basically the story in a nutshell. This is one of those giallo thrillers that is so late in the game that it may well be classified as slasher movie. Fabio Testi is the detective tracking down the clues and uncovering the mystery. By and large the movie is serviceable. It works better as a time capsule than as a genuine thriller. Yes this is the kind of movie that was likely playing on 42nd Street when TAXI DRIVER was made, and looks it. Still in some ways its more shocking than what passes for ""underground cinema"" nowadays. The actually solution is pretty astonishing. Think of this as a ungodly yet logical precursor for the likes of TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME. This is the the third of three movies that Fabio Testi made about girls being murdered in a school setting. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH SOLANGE?. is the the first and best.",1431388800,,894,4.4573170731707314

8319253,2,B001LNOLNW,"Not much trauma here. A lot of gratuitous t&a, including a lengthly shower scene in a girls' locker room. The nice thing about that is these are real women, not the new-millennium, fake-boob, Barbie doll variety. It's the 70s, Italy, La Dolce Vita! Woohoo!

The plot? Woman die, guy investigates, nudity ensues.

There is a cute twist at the climax and a wholly unbelievable ending. The twist would have gotten it 3 stars, but the ending? You gotta be kidding. Worth renting. 2 stars.",1355875200,,484,4.75
8319254,3,B001LNOLNW,"The editorial review here is correct in that Italian director Dallamano provided input on the script for this Spanish production helmed by Negrin.  Fabio Testi is the biggest name star in this tale that features schoolgirls in a fine school who sneak out for some extra money providing sexual favors for the wealthy and powerful ... until these patrons go too far and kill one of the girls.  This print by Sinister Cinema is superior to one I bought from Ebay, featuring better colors and sound, but it is still cropped rather badly (evident from the titles).  More of an historical oddity than anything else, this still has a surprising trace of nudity and gore.  The police inspector on the case has the most entertaining means of interrogation -- makes you wonder just how far the police really could go at the time -- including interrogation by roller coaster!  Yes, one strange film.  For completists in the genre only -- one might start by watching Dallamano's What Have You Done To Solange? and What Have They Done To Your Daughters?",1320710400,2,1040,4.75
