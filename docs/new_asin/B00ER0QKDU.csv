8608640,2,B00ER0QKDU,"I thought this title was totally intriguing.  It sounds like...maybe a comedy?  With a smiling kid on the cover one can imagine a harmless sci-fi film?  None of that.  The filmmaker does a biography of life in post-Soviet Georgia by getting average people to discuss their lives and thoughts.  Everything seems unremittingly depressing.  Perhaps that's exactly what it's meant to be--if so I just wish the title and cover didn't suggest something more whimsical.  Why not something like ""Camus does a biography of Modern Georgia""?  Even the rural scenes look generally ugly and depressing.  Rural life does not appear simple and ennobling but rather a grim struggle to survive.  If you're looking for something to calm an unnaturally cheerful disposition this should work.",1412380800,,772,5.203252032520325
8608641,5,B00ER0QKDU,"The Machine Which Makes Everything Disappear is truly a profound document of a specific time in the country of Georgia. Tinatin Gurchiani sets up a situation where people aged 15 through 25 (with some exceptions) arrive at a location to be part of this documentary, then she let's them talk and several times follows them back into their lives. There is no specific order to events. (This has bothered a few reviewers but not me.) This is certainly not a tourist documentary nor even a sociological examination. Yet I would also say that you can learn a great deal about Georgia by watching this film. But in reality her approach is poetic. She will just hold the camera still (occasionally I thought about Paradjanov or Tarkovsky) and simply show you a wall, a tree, a road, a village and most importantly faces. She made me want to know these truly human people in the midst of their difficulties.

Tinatin Gurchiani has made a documentary that is not only about life in Georgia, about hopes and dreams and about the wall these aspirations run into, particularly in her country. Yet is ultimately about life itself. It is about the way we often simply find ourselves stalled, delayed, waiting, sometimes even crushed and yet we are still moving, still hoping, still searching for meaning.",1390262400,3,1290,4.8108108108108105
8608642,4,B00ER0QKDU,"""The Machine Which Makes Everything Disappear"" (2012 release from Georgia; 97 min.) is a documentary about the day-to-day struggles of the people in Georgia. As the movie opens we see a young man being interviewed for the possible casting of a movie. We are informed that the director had sent an open cast call directed to young people in Georgia aged 15 to 25. As it turns out some younger and older people nevertheless also show up. We get to know these people as they tell particular things about their lives, and for some of them the director then goes out to follow them in their actual lives. That's it as far as the ""plot"" is concerned. Meaning there really is no plot whatsoever. Just portraits of ordinary people in their at times not-so-ordinary circumstancces.

Several comments: director Tinatin Gurchiani brings us a diverse if at times disturbing look at the lives of mostly young people. We meet a young woman who when she is asked ""if you had a machine which can disappear everything, what would you disappear?"", the young lady responds with ""I'd want to disappear myself"", and then explains why. A young man later on says ""I don't understand why people say life is beautiful"". Indeed, the bleak outlook on life offered by so many of them is outright frightening, and heartbreaking. A number of them comment on the enormous influence that the Abkhasian war has had on their own lives and their families. And yet, beyond all that, there is STILL a sprinkle of hope. Watch the young man whose brother has been in jail for 5-6 years already with another 17-18 years to go, and how he tries to keep friends and family engaged with his jailed brother. Even more amazing is the story of the young woman whose mother left her entire family to take up with another man 15 years ago. The young woman now decides she needs to see her mother after all these years, to come to closure of sorts. What happens will move you to your core.

I saw this movie just this weekend at the Laemmie's Music Hall Theatre in Los Angeles, and the screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended, not even for a matinee. That's a shame. No, this is not necessarily an ""easy"" or ""fun"" movie. but it is a very rich and rewarding movie, no question about it. Kudos to director Gurchiani for bringing us this ode to her home country of Georgia. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign documentary that is GALAXIES away from your standard Hollywood fare, do not miss this! ""The Machine Which Makes Everything Disappear"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377388800,7,2542,4.596916299559472
