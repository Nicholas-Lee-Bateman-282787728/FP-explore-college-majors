8007101,5,B000162ZR4,"I enjoy these episodes of Kipper, Wish Bone, Bob the Builder, etc. They're all from 2004. Even the big kids stop and watch. They're all fun to watch and great for preschoolers. The only thing I didn't like was having to wait for all of the Interpol messages and and one advertisement before getting to the main menu each time I play this video. It doesn't play automatically, but once you select the first episode, it plays from there all of the shows. Overall, a good DVD at a very affordable price at less than $3.",1326585600,2,516,4.385416666666667
