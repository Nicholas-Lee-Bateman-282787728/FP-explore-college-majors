8166712,4,B000M67TF6,"I enjoyed it, but be aware that it is entirely in Castilian Spanish with Castilian slang terms which can be confusing.  No subtitles, so be warned.  However, Banderas looked absolutely mouthwatering................  It's a little explicit but then who doesn't want to see Banderas nude in his youth.",1397520000,,299,5.319148936170213

8166715,1,B000M67TF6,"No me gust la pelcula, aburrida.  Cuando termin de ver la pelcula, part el disco en muchos pedazos y lo tir a la basura.  El tema y la participacin de los actores fue mediocre.  En otras pelculas Antonio Banderas ha trabajado excelente.",1310860800,,236,4.571428571428571
8166716,3,B000M67TF6,"Almadovar's ""Law of Desire"" is a good movie, but not a great one.  The plot is formulaic in a Hollywood mold, not unlike ""Fatal Attraction"" and all the knock-offs that have followed.  Almadovar can't be accused of being one of them, because his film and ""FA"" were released the same year.  But it remains formulaic: a one night stand leads to an obsession which ends tragically.

What's not formulaic is that Almodovar's lead characters are all sexually unconventional, and all of them illustrate the extreme fluidity of personal identity.  Most obviously, Carmen Maura plays Tina, a transsexual looking for a man she can trust and wanting to erase all physical vestiges of her past as a boy and youth.  Her brother Pablo, played by Eusebio Poncela, is a gay director who bed-hops but loves Juan.  Pablo begins a dalliance with Antonio, played by a very young Antonio Banderas, and writes letters to him which he signs ""Laura P."":  fluidity of identity.  Juan thinks he's straight, but discovers that he loves Pablo.  Antonio pretends he's straight, but is secretly and manically gay:  fluidity again and again.  In portraying such sexually complex characters, Almodovar is surely inviting viewers to ask themselves about the fluidity of their own personal identities.  Do classifications such as ""gay"" or ""straight"" make sense as rigid designators?

The acting is really quite good, and is what manages to make the film's formula exciting.  Carmen Maura's Tina is heartbreaking:  vulnerable, haunted, lonely, with a lot of love to give.  Poncela's Eusebio is also good, especially in the scenes with Ada (played by Manuela Velasco), a young girl Tina has adopted.",1220486400,4,1663,5.077490774907749
