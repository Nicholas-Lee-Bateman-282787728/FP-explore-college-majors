4993918,5,B006JN87EI,"A must see for those raised on the PBS show or any parent whose children watch television.

Wouldn't ""we"" all like to live in Mister Rogers real neighborhood, especially nearly next door? (I say ""we"" because the long-running PBS show ` ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" - came a bit after my own childhood. I grew up on ""Ding Dong School"" and ""Romper Room"".) Well MTV producer Ben Wagner - along with his cameraman brother, Chris, actually did live next to Fred Rogers in Nantucket, RI, when he was growing up. Rogers died in 2003 and the filmmaker Wagner brothers decided to produce a documentary tribute to Rogers and the ideals he set out to share with his PBS audience through his PBS show.

Through archival photos - gathered from the Rogers family - and interviews with celebrities - including another Nantucket neighbor, the late Tim Russert (NBC's ""meet The Press), NPRs original ""All Things Considered"" host, Susan Stamberg,, and Nick News producer Linda Ellerbee, the Wagners weave a loving tribute to this ""gentle"" man who never had an unkind word for anyone.

The fact that placing a child in front of a TV set when MRN was on was a ""safe place to be"" is reiterated throughout the 70-minute film. Unlike ""Sesame Street"" and ""Barney"", Rogers never used his name or show to sell merchandise to children. There are facts revealed in Ben Wagner's narration that will interest parents. The percent of one-year old children who have a TV in their room was just one that astounded me.

If I was left with one question after watching the film, it was that the Wagners interviewed nearly everyone that was ""connected"" to Rogers and his career but not his family. We learn, briefly, that he had two sons but - aside from one photo - they are never mentioned again, nor interviewed.

The DVD has bonus features including a commentary with the two Wagners (this in addition to the fact that Ben Wagner narrates the film. Bonus interviews with Russert and Stamberg are here as well plus a Q&A with David Newell (Mr. McFeely) and Angela Santomero (creator of ""Blue's Clue's"" and ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood"")

I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who grew up watching MRN or any current parent of young children who watch a lot of television.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4993919,5,B006JN87EI,This biography of Mr Rogers is a must see.  His life story is so uplifting especially for adults. Leaves you with faith in humanity.,1527120000,,132,4.5
4993920,1,B006JN87EI,"This basically a vanity piece about the director's brush with Fred Rogers. It was annoying in just about every way a little film like this could be. From the director's annoying lisp to his self-indulgent (and uninteresting) stories, this is the antithesis of what a film about Mr. Rogers should be.",1526947200,4,299,4.882352941176471
4993921,5,B006JN87EI,"Gentle and moving documentary about Mr. Rogers and some of the people whose lives he touched.

4993922,5,B006JN87EI,"This is a wonderful film that makes you want to be a better person.  But I wish there had been some mention of Mrs. Rogers.  No married man can devote himself to others as Mr. Rogers did without the full support of his spouse, which is itself a true act of love.",1526083200,,262,4.019230769230769
4993923,5,B006JN87EI,"There will never be another Mr. Rogers...
He spoke with respect and love to all in his audience.
He never treated children like they couldn't understand...never talking down to them.
He taught me the importance of listening...100%,
because deep inside of everyone is a child who needs to know someone cares....",1526083200,,310,5.098039215686274

4993925,5,B006JN87EI,"What a touching film. This has the energy of Mr. Rogers all through it - gentle, kind, and slow. It does probably say a lot more about the people influenced by Mr. Rogers than the man himself, but still - very touching and very worth your time.",1525910400,,244,4.212765957446808

4993927,5,B006JN87EI,Absolute must see! It brought me to tears and reminded me of the core values he taught me growing up. We need to teach our children these simple lessons. His message is everything! We must not forget. Thank you for making this film and filling my heart with gratitude! I will forever be thankful for having Mister Rogers in my life during my childhood.,1525219200,,352,4.515625
4993928,5,B006JN87EI,How wonderful it would have been to have Mr. Rogers as my real life neighbor.  May his example live on in all our actions and attitudes with ourselves and others.,1525046400,,162,4.4
4993929,5,B006JN87EI,This documentary is nicely paced. The author actually was a neighbor of Mr. Rogers on Nantucket. I liked how Benjamin interviewed people likeTim Russert regarding their experiences with Fred Rogers. Highly recommended.,1525046400,,218,5.84375
4993930,1,B006JN87EI,"To voice earlier audience critics, I couldn't get past 5 minutes of this. Love Mr. Rogers but even the initial story of his meeting was painfully told and it lost me the minute it became nothing about Mr. Rogers, which is clear a couple minutes in. When a super cool story isn't presented well from the start, you know it's a downhill ride from there.",1525046400,3,351,4.415384615384616
4993931,5,B006JN87EI,"I didn't know this documentary existed until I came across it today in the Prime listings. I'm so glad I did!
I've always admired Mister Rogers, but this little film brought an exponentially more profound depth to that admiration. Fred Roger's message is desperately needed in our current climate, and I will be recommending this as widely as my little corner of the universe allows.
The Wagners succeeded in capturing and shining out his inherent ability to inspire us to strive to be our better selves. What a gift!",1524873600,,517,4.820224719101123
4993932,5,B006JN87EI,EXCELLENT MOVIE and look at Mister Rogers from a different perspective. We still need someone like him teaching our children.,1524787200,,125,5.3
4993933,2,B006JN87EI,"I would love to see a movie about Mister Rogers.  This unfortunately should've been titled ""Me & Mister Rogers"" because after watching about 5 minutes of the film I learned only where he was born and that his Grandfather was the source of some of his inspiration, and little else about him.  There was quite a bit of information about the filmmaker though.  Why can't these documentary filmmakers make films that are about their subjects and not themselves anymore?  I can't remember the filmmaker's name, but Mr. Rogers' I can't forget.",1524700800,3,537,4.868131868131868
4993934,5,B006JN87EI,Loved loved loved this documentary. Growing up in South America I never got to watch his show but always heard what an amazing person he was in real life. So nice to see someone make a documentary focusing on his kindness and not just his professional achievements. It's a very inspiring message no matter who you are.,1524528000,,318,4.5964912280701755
4993935,5,B006JN87EI,"I kept thinking while I was watching this film that We Need A Mr Rogers, Now! This man who is so comforting, who likes us just the way we are, and does not ask more of us than we can give. Everyone should have a Mr Rogers in their life.

Ben Wagner met Fred Rogers on Cape Cod where Ben was vacationing. Fred Rogers and his wife had a small corner home right near the water. It was big enough for them and very comfortable. They could relax and enjoy their neighbors. Fred helped Ben through some difficulties with his kind words and direction. They wrote and emailed each other.

When Fred died, Ben and Chris traveled the land looking for people whose lives were touched by Fred Rogers. They found many people, and in this documentary, we get to meet them all, and hear their stories. This is one of the most comforting and tear inducing documentaries. The love and joy Mr Rogers brought into their lives is immeasurable. It seems Mr Rogers touched people just by walking into the room, he had some sort of quality that attracted the good in people. We get to meet one of Freds sons and grandson, what a joy that is. We can see in Fred Rogers eyes what love he had for them. Freds son had the same kind of loving demeanor that Fred had. I often wonder what it must have been like being brought up by Fred Rogers.

Everyone should see this film to remind us what kindness, love and joy brings.

I personally cant say I remember Mr. Rogers influence being so powerful at the time, but this documentary has made me recognize just how powerful and valuable he really was for so many people. That, combined with the problems we face today, I now appreciate his always positive, loving force, and his never ending love for the children (and adults) of the world. We need so many more like Mr. Rogers today. Thank you for your service, Mr. Rogers.

4993946,5,B006JN87EI,"An amazing behind-the-scenes look at Fred Rogers from some of the people who knew him best. The documentary wasn't preachy or self righteous, it simply demonstrated who Mister Rogers really was through stories about him from some of his actual neighbors and others who had experiences with him that gave them insights into who the man really was.

4993949,5,B006JN87EI,"I wasn't expecting to love this film, but to my surprise, I did. It was a celebration of Fred Rogers, as witnessed by people who knew him or were influenced by him. The message was simple. Children need to feel safe and loved; those that do are far more likely to pass it on to others. Fred Rogers was a wonderful human being and this was a lovely tribute to him.",1522972800,,363,4.126760563380282

4993951,5,B006JN87EI,"To put it as ""deeply and simply"" as I can, the Wagner brothers did a great service to us by reminding us of Fred Rogers' legacy, to the Rogers family by proving that ""beautiful, noble and sacred"" is still a relevant ideal by which we aspire to live, and to film makers at large for manifesting today's public's thirst for wholesome and meaningful  content.",1522886400,,356,4.5625

He truly made you feel like the only person in the room, the only person he was talking to. As shown & stated in the movie he genuinely liked & appreciated each & every one of us just the way we are.

4993984,4,B006JN87EI,"seeing this thoughtful documentary on the life of Fred Rogers touched me. I never watched Mister Rogers's PBS show and I was well aware of it, but did not understand what he was doing and what motivated him...too busy, I guess. I was not planning to watch this film, only preview it, but when the filmmakers said they were from Iowa City, Iowa (I'm from Des Moines), I decided to let it roll. Glad I did. In the wake of recent and unprecedented gun violence and death in our schools, the empirical evidence would suggest that someone has forgotten to help the children and we can no longer ignore the lasting and damaging effects of our consumerist capitalist system on the most vulnerable and impressionable among us-the kids. These distracted, frightened little creatures are under assault and there is no one helping them nor among the adults today even sounding the alarm. Fred Rogers understood the children are our future and was deeply concerned for them and the world they would inherit. I am brooding and angry and I do not see hope for this corrupt cesspool of humanity. My read on people has been that they are inherently and immutably corrupt. That view is very true, but it may be possible that kindness and respect can at least coexist along side the corruption and soften it and make it less painful--I think that might be what Fred Rogers was trying to show.",1522022400,9,1374,4.658436213991769

This movie had a few snip-its about Fred Rogers, but it was more about other people's impressions of him after meeting him.  The film maker had way too much information about himself in this movie.  The movie had more of a biography of himself than he did of Mr. Rogers in this movie.  Love Mr. Rogers the person.  Dislike the movie that is trying to make money off of Fred Roger's name.",1453852800,7,470,4.235955056179775

Mr. Rogers favorite author and philosopher was my late brother Bo Lozoff who is in the movie.
I also enjoyed seeing famous people like Tim Russert, Tom Brokaw and many others who had wonderful things to say about Mr. Rogers. The impact Mr. Rogers had on at least two generations is still felt and may be the basis for many peoples ethics and understanding of what's is right and self esteem.

4994102,1,B006JN87EI,"The filmmaker is using a passing acquaintance with Mister Rogers (he met him twice when he was in his 30s) to further his career. Benjamin Wanger (producer, writer, director, star, soundtrack, etc. etc. etc.) is awful. The writing is bad, the music is worse, and the narration should have been done by someone else (he lisps). It reeked of exploitation to me, which is so sad, especially when you are talking about Fred Rogers. Mr. Wanger was on camera way too much; he talked too much without anything interesting to say. He was like the one man band of this documentary and Mister Rogers deserves a lot more. If you're hoping to wax nostalgic about the Land of Make Believe, you can forget about it. There is a complete lack of interviews with anyone who actually worked with Mister Rogers or on the show (interviews were mostly with casual friends/penpals) which makes me wonder if people who really knew him knew this project was bogus. By the end of it I was just laughing as they would cut to ANOTHER shot of Benjamin driving his car ""Oh, hey, it's me again! Remember me?"" and then at the end this awful song comes on over the credits and I thought ""I bet this is him singing and playing"" -- this is his vehicle to get noticed, after all. I was correct, it was his crappy song. So if you want to see Benjamin Wagner's tribute to himself with a few bits and pieces about Mister Rogers here and there, or if you want to laugh at someone who is way too into themselves, then by all means watch this thing and enjoy. But don't expect to be moved to tears or to learn much of anything you didn't already know about one of the most inspiring Americans there's ever been.",1413676800,13,1670,4.407766990291262

If you want those things watch this video first and then go elsewhere. You do, however, get an insight into his life and heart as it affected people around him. The way he was bullied as a child and how he fought back through a life devoted to true concern for others is inspiring. To be remembered so lovingly by people you've touched is all anyone could ever ask of life.

I could watch this over and over again, never tiring of it.
  One thing....it's really sad how our country has gotten so ""sarcastic, uncaring, and self-centered""............people have gotten so ""into their own selves,"" that they don't stop to think about the importance of the Golden Rule.

4994170,5,B006JN87EI,"I had to agree with what Mister Rogers stood for in his lifetime. He understood that life for children was going to get harder. Television, video games, the internet. Everything now is buy this and that, sex humor and bad language. I like many grew up with Mister Rogers. Just today my sis and I were saying that we wish we lived in more in times when things were calm. We just lived a few years in the 80s. Then I said that SADLY our children who aren't born yet won't get that time. Or any of that time. Mister Rogers wanted to keep kids safe from all that's going on in the world now. This documentary lets us know how he fought for kids education. It was like he was trying to shelter all the children from harm. Which now I see is the real world. We see interviews from the people that he touched in a special way. He loved everyone and everyone loved him. Isn't that the greatest commandment? Jesus said, ""Love one another as I have loved you."" RIP Mister Rogers. My children will also grow up watching your show. :)",1380931200,,1022,4.246153846153846

I cried my way through this entire documentary, out of missing such a special person, and also seeing that under the surface, however hardened it may be, that every single person wants the same thing: to be loved and accepted unconditionally.

But when my Son was born I became very interested in what was out there for him on TV. I watched my child as he watched certain shows - most of them seemed to agitate him - not either good or bad - but there was not a moment of peace and reality. So I DECIDED TO TURN ON Mr. R and it was like magic - my son watched attentively, fully engaged - often laughing. I watched also and was immediately drawn in by the kindness and valuable real life situations and solutions.

Today we have been blessed with a grandson. He in now almost 7 and was brought up on MR.R and loved watching him presently - he loves the old black and whites as they are really unique in our world today. Amazon has a few of these!

4994202,5,B006JN87EI,"I stumbled across this documentary on PBS while casually channel-surfing earlier this evening. There was nothing better on at the time, and like every other American my age, I grew up watching Mr. Rogers, so figured I might as well watch. Never did I anticipate the emotional response it triggered. As the filmmakers demonstrate through a series of interviews and correspondence with friends and associates, Fred Rogers was the embodiment of love, kindness, and acceptance. Although he is gone, I am wistful as I imagine the positive impact our society could experience if we were all to embrace the ideals that Mr. Rogers promoted- and more importantly, lived by.

One of the film's most illuminating anecdotes is from a young man who was acquainted with Mr. Rogers while growing up, and had the opportunity to interview him years later for his own television show. He presented Mr. Rogers with a conflict he was having with his upstairs neighbor, who resented hearing the loud music blasting from his apartment below. Mr. Rogers went beyond choosing sides in the dispute. Instead, he emphasized two key concepts: that individuals have the right to live in peaceful silence, and that in order to live together, we need to reach out and get to know those around us. At a time when divisiveness and the ability to shout down opponents are qualities we reward in our politicians, and our communication comes in the form of stunted thoughts limited to 140 characters or less, we need Mr. Rogers more than ever.",1333843200,27,1507,4.909803921568628

Through conversations with a variety of notable individuals, the message of ""deep and simple"" is solidified in those of us who grew up with regular visits to the Neighborhood and we are reminded of the authenticity of Fred Rogers -- both on and off the camera.

Certainly, Mister Rogers & Me is more than just another documentary. It is a challenge to better ourselves and to recognize the importance of what is deep and simple -- to appreciate every second and every moment, every person and every meeting, that we are blessed to experience.

I loved watching Mr. Rogers as a kid and was hoping to have more of a ""walk down memory lane"" through directly re-experiencing clips from the show, but instead, there was a strong religious overtone (delivered via interviews with a bunch of people who knew Rogers) and I'm sure that overtone was always there, but really it bounced off the surface of my mind as a kid and I just absorbed the ""be kind to everyone and treat them as you would like to be treated"".  To me this is just being decent, I don't need to be bludgeoned with the religious trappings.
The main problem was listening to people TELLING me about the show instead of the documentary SHOWING me the show.",1528243200,,761,4.397163120567376
8499585,4,B006JN87EI,"Chances are that if you're considering watching this short documentary, there's nothing profound I can write that you likely don't already know about the impact of Mister Rogers. What I will say in a few sentences however, is that this documentary will reinforce how you already feel about the sweater-wearing neighbor who ""loved you just the way you are.""

The film covers a handful collection of his peers, colleagues, and friends, who all share personal stories and anecdotes about things Mister Rogers taught them, and how his kindness and his respect made their lives better, especially the impact he had on the narrator, who is the ""me"" of the title.

Some will say the documentary lays it on thick, and is overly maudlin. Others may say it didn't go far enough and just touched the surface of Mister Roger's reach on society. As for me, I think it is both, but more important than that, the documentary is a smile inducer. It made me feel good while watching it, and it put me in a good mood thereafter. Exactly the way Mister Rogers makes everyone feel when he's on screen.
I highly recommend it, for kids and adults of all ages, who may or may not have had the pleasure to watch Mister Rogers directly on television.",1528070400,,1225,4.640552995391705

8499587,2,B006JN87EI,"The legacy of Fred Rogers deserves better than this. The overall quality of this documentary is closer to that of a film school project than that of a legitimate, well-crafted film treatment of a beloved public figure.

There's too much narration (despite many interview segments) during which the filmmaker just sounds like he's reading right off the page without making it sound conversational or spontaneous. The filmmaker says that he was a double-major in creative writing and journalism. But his written narration contains annoying grammatical errors (along the lines of ""I paid he and his wife a visit..."")

Why is Bo Lozoff featured so prominently in this film? Six years before the film was released, Lozoff was accused of (and didn't deny) sexually and emotionally abusing parolees at his rehabilitation facility for ex-convicts.

And how long did it take to make this 79-minute documentary? Tim Russert died in 2007, but is interviewed in this 2014 film.

The music right before the closing credits blares onto the scene in a somewhat ridiculous and inappropriately funny way.

It's watchable. It's short. It does try to honor Fred Rogers. But it should have been much better.",1527552000,,1187,5.129533678756476
