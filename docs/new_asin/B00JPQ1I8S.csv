6388525,5,B00JPQ1I8S,"I thoroughly enjoy B-Rate movies.  And the great part is, is Mill Creek Entertainment finally put some of them in the aptly named ""B-Movie Blast"" 50 movie pack.  This can be bought by itself or in the ""100 Cult Classics"" package.
  I personally enjoy the fact that mill Creek has packages these.  And yes, many, if not all of these, films are in other collections put out by Mill Creek Entertainment.  Regardless if you are a fan of these movies or just Mill creek Entertainment products, one will not be disappointed.  If one already has many of Mill Creek Entertainment film pack collections, than this is redundant to get.  But if you don't have many or any of their movie pack collections, than the ""B-Movie Blast"" 50 movie pack collection is DEFINATELY a worthwhile buy.",1404950400,8,775,4.688888888888889

This is a mix and match of 7 different 12 movie packs that omits several titles from the individual releases. More info can be found in the comments section of this review.",1398211200,59,3566,4.212609970674487
8652985,2,B00JPQ1I8S,Only about 20% were reasonably good.  Unfortunately the disks were coated with some oil and/or dirt and required cleaning in order to load and play.,1504828800,,148,4.92
8652986,1,B00JPQ1I8S,Not a one of 13 disc was what was advertised on the back cover listings. They were all Black and white old 1930's type films,1502409600,,124,4.0
8652987,4,B00JPQ1I8S,Not a bad collection! Enjoyed it!,1478304000,3,33,4.666666666666667
8652988,1,B00JPQ1I8S,The enclosed DVDs were not those listed on the box,1475107200,,50,4.1
8652989,1,B00JPQ1I8S,"Purchased last year...finally started to watch it Saturday and found it to have the wrong discs in the box..  Only 12 discs and not the 13 advertised, but it did contain 50 movies...just not the ones listed on the box!  So disappointed, because the movies are a genre that I don't enjoy...crime.  Found out that Amazon would not replace since this box was purchased too long ago...double disappointment!  So, lesson learned.  Always check your discs immediately upon receipt.",1474848000,2,475,5.038461538461538
8652990,1,B00JPQ1I8S,"I had the same problem as another reviewer did: the discs did not contain the movies listed on the box and in the product description. The discs I received contained titles that were primarily crime dramas/film noir from the 30s-50s. I did some investigating on Mill Creek Entertainment's website & found that the discs I received are from another 50-film box set called ""Crime Wave.""

I hesitated to give this item one star because I'm not reviewing the movies themselves but I felt it was important to let people know about this issue, as mine might not be the only defective set.
I've already initiated the return process w/ Amazon. Haven't yet decided if I'll try to re-order it and hope that Mill Creek has  corrected this packaging error.",1467417600,5,744,4.75968992248062
