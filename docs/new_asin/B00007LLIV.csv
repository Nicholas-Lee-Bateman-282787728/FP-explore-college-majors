I just wanted to let people know that this ""boxed set"" is really just all 6 individual DVD's bundled together. Nothing new...no fancy box...no extras. If you missed the real boxed set or have just been holding out for the discs, you should pick this set up. ...you're getting a very good deal and it's worth the investment.",1040601600,50,466,4.430232558139535
1820866,5,B00007LLIV,"Theres anime, and then there Cowboy Bebop. This is like nothing else you've ever seen before! If your looking for something competely different from all else Bebop is for you.
  Inside every action packed episode you get,
  -Stunningingly beutiful and realistic animation
  _The most original, story enhancing, mood setting music  found on any animated series anywhere
  _Deep provocative story telling featuring characters that trully feal ""real""
  _At least one gunfight and or starship battle!
Not only all that but this is the best deal around, purchased seperatly you'll spend much more, and once you see the first episodes you won't WANT the rest you'll NEED the rest.

1820868,5,B00007LLIV,"cowboy bebop way outstripped my expectations. georgous graphics and a really good sound track. If you get a chance to, definetly buy the perfect sessions dvd. its better because it has the soundtrack but make sure your perfect sessions has 6 or 7 discs. if it has three DO NOT BUY IT. I made that mistake and found myself with 3 bootlegged copies.

1820888,3,B00007LLIV,I bought this cause The movie is one of my top favorite anime movies. But its just boring to me. Eds funny. And a few good bounty stories. Maybe its the soundtrack. I don't know. Glad to own it. Probably won't watch again for a really long time.,1473984000,,245,4.125
1820889,5,B00007LLIV,"This my all time favorite Anime Series. I can watch this series back to back to back to back. The characters have flaws which allows you love  them. The writing is beautiful and makes you ponder if humans can live on Titan or Europa. The comedy is not over the top, which is wonderful because some Anime can take it there. The soundtrack and the score are awesome and effortlessly intertwined together. It is ashame there will be no more Cowboy BeBop but maybe that is the charm of it.",1472601600,,485,4.388888888888889

That being said, this collection had one horrible flaw that kept it from being a perfect five star: Utter and complete ruining of the last two episodes of disc 4, ""Mushroom Samba"" and ""Speak Like A Child"". These episodes have been somehow corrupted, showing only broken static and warped, out of synch audio, with dialogue and noises being horribly sped up, slowed down, or completely disappearing.",1471651200,,508,4.850574712643678

1820941,5,B00007LLIV,"I'm giving this show 5 stars for originality, character development, fun, and an interesting story arc. Your mileage may vary, but I loved Spike and his crew.

I am not much of an anime fan (where the men look like women, the women look like girls with tits, the girls look like boys in drag, and the boys look like monkeys, unless they are bad, in which case they either look like potatoes or switchblades), but this show was something special. I saw it because I was describing Firefly to a friend and he said, ""That sounds like a kind of live-action Cowboy Bebop.""  Having watched it through, there is some resemblance, with a group of disparate folk trying to make a life for themselves in a somewhat seedy science fiction future - but Spike the ""Space Cowboy"" is not a cowboy, and River Tam is a dog. I think. Which would make Ed Mr. Universe. I wanted to learn more about the dog (Ein, short for Einstein), but then I wanted to learn a hell of a lot more about River. I am becoming used to disappointment. But I hope they make a sequel to Cowboy Bebop. Because that last scene... oh hell. Worth it, but oh. Bloody. Hell.

I am also not much of a jazz fan, but the music is really good, even if you don't like jazz. My husband, who does like jazz, loved it.

In terms of the CD set itself, there are some compression problems; it's not the best visually, but it was decent value for the money. If you really care, there are probably better and more expensive versions out there.",1421107200,,1483,4.323741007194244

The intro music is probably my favorite for any TV show ever, an amazing jazz arrangement which does not get old even while bingeing your way through all the episodes for the 5th time.  Characters are fun and interesting and it has a great balance of action/story.

Only thing I will add and the main reason I am making this review is that you can find this brand new on e bay for $20 (which is where I've purchased it).

Sometimes there are instances where collaborations of peoples' work turns into high art-- Cowboy Bebop does that.  The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are fun, and as others have commented, the episodes stand by themselves.  It has very noir-ish aspects, can be really funny, can be tragic even operatic, and sometimes doesn't take itself too seriously.  Excellent stories written throughout--it keeps you guessing. At the end you want more, but there is also a kind of cathartic satisfaction. Enjoyable and accessible for anyone over 13 I would say.",1409961600,,673,5.045045045045045

1821008,1,B00007LLIV,"I love Cowboy Bebop.  But, after being burned by two bootleg copies disguised like the real thing, I have given up on this version of the release entirely.

However, if you still want to buy this release, there are some things you may want to worry about/look for:
1) The company that produced this box set has since closed its doors.  For many reasons, this has seen a boom in the production (and apparently quality) of bootleg releases, so you can forget any kind of support from the publisher.  AND, they're just not being made anymore... so who are they being bought from new?
2) This release should have 6 discs, each with a storage capacity of about 6.0GBs.  Bootleg releases won't have as large of discs, and because of this, the picture quality suffers.  A lot.  I learned this from several forum posts and reddit, so it may be a falsehood, but considering many of my other quality DVD releases have this approximate storage capacity, it would make more sense.
3) The releases I got had security stickers on them, and the box seemed really well put together.  However, the plastic cover for the jacket was pretty crummy and ripped quite easily if I didn't focus in taking off the security sticker.

So... it's really hard to tell what's fake and what's not.  If you're cool with not-great picture and still pretty decent audio of the remixed version of Cowboy Bebop, buy away - this is a great price.  But... just wait for Funimation's release in December.  It's going to be SOOOOO much better.",1407715200,7,1502,4.626415094339623

1821037,3,B00007LLIV,"UPDATE: dude...I popped in the DVD & it looks like someone burned this from YouTube clips. Artifacting is absolutely horrid. I ended up but the blu-ray version & unfortunately not 16:9 because original was 4:3 (soooo sad). Buy the blu-ray. Don't bother w/this

This is t a review about the story, but moreso myself and the packaging. So just letting you know off the bat.

Anyways, I don't usually buy anime or movies period because when I watch something, I don't need to watch it again ever. The only show I've watched 3 times over is azumanga daioh (the princess if not queen of spice-of-life genre to Lucky Star). Anyways, I've always caught bebop on Cartoon Network when the REAL adult swim was on in the early 2000s...but never really felt too connected to was going on because I'd always catch it at unusual times and such -- but I (and my parents) always loved watching it. This is pretty much obligatory if you're an anime fan and I look forward to seeing this.

I was trying to hold out for the North American Blu-Ray release and I might get it when it drops, but they've overshot their original release date by a LOT (2014 quarter 1...umm it's mid-June).

Moving on, the picture of the packaging is very misleading. It's not a thick case the size of a mid-sized novel like implied, it's instead a regular DVD case with the typical disc holding flaps and such. My case when it arrived came wrapped in the ""new package"" plastic & wasn't bent so that's good. However you remember those security strip sticky things on the top of the DVD to prevent people from easily opening? Well that's on there and it wouldn't be a problem, but if not careful it leaves am ugly sticky residue. I know there's probably some simple way to remove it with peanut butter or whatever way the net suggests, but it hurts me inside to see that. Also something that's always pissed me off is snapping of the cases when closing. When a case closes. It needs to have a firm SNAP. The case I got snapped great at the bottom, but the top barely holds and it's almost like it doesn't exist. It's really minor, but it irks me so much since I paid about $30 for 2-day shipping (canada -_-). I just wanted a perfectly normal case...

Anyways i popped the DVD in and it's doing good so far. No issues, but if there are I'll update my review, but so far the discs look like they're in good condition.",1402876800,3,2374,4.435779816513762

1821067,4,B00007LLIV,"The DVD set features a great, colorful transfer (the only artifacts I noticed were in the title sequence) and 5.1 soundtrack

The series itself, I have mixed feelings about.  In short, it's good, but I wouldn't rate it a masterpiece.

The animation ranges from very good to sublimely beautiful.  The story, while entertaining is weak.  It started off well, with some surprisingly mature twists that in retrospect I see fooled me into believing the series was ""deeper"" than it turned out to be.  The characters, while lovable, are underdeveloped.  There isn't a consistent narrative arc, and often even within a single episode, the tale proceeds in fits and jerks. I've seen anime that did a much better job telling a story--for instance, Soul Eater.  While I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop's more adult-oriented tone far more than Soul Eater's more child-centered one, once soul Eater ""settled down"" after the first few episodes, it spun a coherent, well paced, and interesting yarn.

[No, I'm not suggesting  Bebop and Soul Eater are in the same league.  Bebop's character interactions are better, the visuals more sophisticated, and its use of sound effects more cinematic.]",1393372800,,1166,5.116402116402116

This is one of those ""anime for people who hate anime"" series that transcends the genre and becomes a fine work of art. Seriously. Watch it. Now.

Having said that, this release is worthy of the anime and is well-presented with great picture quality and sound. Additionally, it's loaded with some great extras, including selected episode commentaries by both the English and original voice cast and a behind-the-scenes documentary called ""Session 0"" that is really cool.

I'm not sure if this particular set is out of print, which is why the prices seem markedly higher, but I would still recommend purchasing this set if you get the chance.",1393286400,,795,4.838235294117647

The story telling is often nonlinear and disparate plot elements sometimes tie in together only toward the end or in thought afterward, but that's what can make fiction so engaging and enjoyable. A few times an individual tale may have plot holes or inexplicable elements, but by and large everything hangs together well.

1821180,5,B00007LLIV,"I'm not a big ainme guy, but Bebop is one of the best TV shoes I've ever seen. If you've seen Firefly, this is like a better version. Spike, Jet, and later Faye, are ""Cowboys"", the future term for bounty hunters. Eventually, Ed, the hacker, joins the crew and befriends Ein, a ""data dog"" Spike picks up early on. They're good, but often blow through so much ammunition or cause so much property damage that they can only scrape by financially. Spike is an ex Triads member getting away from his past, Jet is an ex cop who quit the force when he got fed up with corruption. Faye has amnesia after an extended rest in a cryogenic pod following a severe injury. She's the femme fatale, who naturally walks around half naked all the time, but her story does get serious as time goes on. As for Ed and Ein, they're Bebop's dynamic duo of geniuses. Seriously, Ein is better at hacking than Ed is. They're my favorite's, so I'm going to geek out for a bit. Ein is adorable and Ed is charming, for some people at least. She doesn't wear shoes or socks and is a bit weird...really weird. She runs by her hacker name, ""Radical Edward"", or Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivruski IV, a name she made up. Ed's a girl, by the way. You later find out her real name might be Franoise, but there's still no way to guarantee that. The show only runs 26 episodes, but each one's a joy too watch (and listen to. It's filled with crazy good music). It even reaches a substantial enough emotional level with a few episodes that made me tear up a bit. Do yourself a favor and at least check it out.",1363564800,3,1568,4.282828282828283

1821182,5,B00007LLIV,"What can ya' say? It's Cowboy Bebop... it's just AWESOME!

1821183,5,B00007LLIV,"In order to keep this short and sweet, here are some reasons that this series is worth adding to your anime collection:

-Spike is a badass and everyone knows this is a scientifically proven fact
-Jet is a great guy who, along with spike, makes a great duo of bounty hunters.
-Faye may at first seem like a narcissistic woman with an attitude (even Spike alludes to this), but she quickly turns out to be a worthy addition
 to the team.
-Ed is a character that may confuse you at first, but she balances out the seriousness of the rest of the cast and happens to be
 one of the most amusing characters in the crew.
-Ein can fit in a suitcase, and because of this fact he is clearly better than any other dog in existence. (sorry folks, but even if you think your
 dog is better, it's simply not true. Can YOUR Labrador retriever fit in a suitcase? Didn't think so.)
-The space western feel is pulled off well. So well in fact, that the environments suck you into them while you watch the show.
-The music is top notch, and the series definitely wouldn't be the same without Yoko Kanno.
-This anime is possibly the best paced show that I have ever seen in my history of watching TV shows.
-There is a great amount of variety in the series, and its episodic nature really helps out when it comes to this fact.

There are plenty of other reasons that Cowboy Bebop is amazing, but I don't want to go too far with this review, so I'll leave it at that. In any case, if you're on the fence with this one, don't bother thinking anymore and just buy it before you try and convince yourself otherwise.",1362700800,,1592,4.293333333333333

Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and their dog, Ein are the top bounty hunters in the solar system. They all have different pasts, different reasons for being partners, and different fates awaiting them. As their pasts come back to haunt them, can they survive and keep their friendship strong, while at the same time making a living catching bad guys?

Cowboy Bebop is an anime legend. It's probably one of the best ever.

1821250,5,B00007LLIV,"Anybody who's ever watched Cowboy Bebop through will tell you that it is the pinnacle of what an anime could be. It's commonly recognized as the first anime where the english vocals are held to have exceeded the original Japanese audio.

That being said, the obvious question for a reviewer is ""Did you like it?""

The resounding answer is ""Hell Yeah!"" Cowboy Bebop lives up to the name it has and is one of the few shows that can be described as a masterpiece. Any anime fan would find a good series here.

As for the actual product. The set is a single box containing six disks with four sessions per disk. The boxing can leave something to be desired but once the disks are in, that is of little consequence.

The audio is in both English and the Japanese so the viewer can choose which format they'd prefer, Dubs or Subs. I encourage any english speaking viewer to try the dubbed version simply for the voice actors portrayals.

As for bonus features, the audio commentary is split between Japanese and English, meaning that one session may have commentary from the original production staff in Japanese while the next may have English commentary by the VA or the art director. All of these are relatively entertaining and have a certain fun quality to them as it shows the people involved with the series enjoyed making it.

This is one product that for fans of anime, it's a no brainer. If you're looking to get into anime, I'd suggest to try elsewhere, only for the fact that this show will set the bar so high for anything to come after.",1349568000,,1544,4.516129032258065

The main characters are Jet a former cop who teams with a former mobster named spike that hunt down wanted felons throughout space to asteroids and planets that seem to mirror different parts of earth, where Mars is a combination of New York, L.A., Tokyo and Hong Kong, Earth is a third world slum, and another planet is a combination of Chicago, Minneapolis, and Moscow put together. The two make allies as they travel through space though reluctantly for Spike since he doesn't like kids, pets, and woman with attitudes of which Ed, Ein, and Faye are in spades. Ed is a brilliant net diving hacker, Ein is a mutated dog, and Faye is a gambler with a debt that would bankrupt any country. The five of them try to make a living bounty hunting, but seem to spend their time fighting to keep food in their bellies. One scene that the music score worked best was when Ed meets up with her estranged father and realizes she has to make a choice, either live with him or stay with the Bebop and its crew with ""Call me, call me,"" playing in the background. When Spike and Jet learn of Ed's decision and Ein's to go with Ed because Ed understands him the most, it seems the Bebop got a little colder and a lot lonlier especially with Jet and Spike eating eggs.

1821279,5,B00007LLIV,"I really just want to review the series itself rather than the dvd collection, so I'll go ahead with that.  First off I'll admit that coming into this series I was pretty skeptical considering the enormous amount of praise and hype the series had gotten over the years.  Well I feel like an idiot now cause this easily was one of the best anime series I've ever seen.  The story follows the bounty hunters Spike and Jet who eventually acquire Ein, Faye, and Ed to complete their crew.  The first few episodes are fairly formulaic, but episode 5 gives you a glimpse into the true nature of Cowboy Bebop.  Many of the episodes honestly do follow a ""monster of the week"" type of formula just with bounties instead, but they're all incredibly well-crafted and there are still a handful of episodes that dig deeper and show the pasts of the main characters.  A person's past and how they deal with it and face it are very prominent themes in Bebop, so of course the main plot involving Spike also involves his past but I don't want to spoil anything for you.  Here's a hint though, pay close attention to that opening scene in episode 1, it's not a random scene like you may think at first.  Anyway, this anime was incredibly entertaining as well as deep and thought-provoking with some great philosophical concepts that really shine in the last three episodes.  Fantastic action, superb art and animation, incredible characters, solid story, interesting themes.  Go watch it right now if you haven't.  Seriously go watch it now!",1339977600,,1524,4.69172932330827
1821280,5,B00007LLIV,"Bounty Hunter/Cowboys in space? What's not to like? I think the most amazing thing about Cowboy Bebop is how the director can take a scifi concept and wrap it in the styling of the 1950s, down to the protagonists clothes, the music throughout the series, the mannerisms. This is widely believed to be one of the best animes ever created and I believe missing out on it is a tragedy.",1337731200,,382,4.4714285714285715
1821281,5,B00007LLIV,"Original 2012 Review:  (Updated info at bottom)

""Cowboy Bebop: Remix- The Complete Collection"" is a 6-Disc Boxed Set released in 2008, containing all 26 episodes of the classic anime series uncut.

I don't want to get bogged down with a plot description, but the series begins by following Spike Spiegel and Jett Black, two bounty-hunters in the future aboard Jett's ship the ""Bebop.""  They are soon joined by Faye- a mysterious woman, Ein- a hyper-intelligent dog and Edward- a young zany girl and a computer hacking genius.  Together, they get involved in many mysteries and adventures, with episodes ranging from light-hearted and funny, to dark, brooding and heart-wrenching.

This is a great boxed set, and the price is right, which is why I'm giving this a 5 out of 5.  Anime can be, and often is, wildly expensive.  And for a time, the only way I bought any anime was by bringing in cheap, region-free import discs.  It's easier to afford a $50 import set than a $150 domestic release of the same exact show.  But this is a good example of a readily-available, decently-priced Region One DVD set.

The picture and sound quality are stronger than prior releases of Bebop, though not very dramatically.  And there are a good handful of special features which add a lot of value.

But mainly, this set is getting a 5 out of 5 for two reasons- the incredible quality of the show (which itself is a 5 out of 5 and is a fine Sci-Fi/Adventure series), and the outstanding price.  (I bought my copy for $30)

This is the set to get if you don't already own Bebop on DVD.

EDIT (3/6/14):
I just felt the need to edit this review and update it for more detail.  Since I wrote this review, the price on this set unfortunately sky-rocketed.  (Used copies are selling for nearly double the price that my new copy cost a few years back.)

I would highly recommend skipping out on this set at this point in time due to the insane price, especially as new DVD/Blu-Ray releases have been announced for the series in 2014.  While this was arguably the definitive release of the series in the past, it no longer will be, and therefore isn't worth the price at this time.",1336003200,,2159,4.572916666666667
1821282,4,B00007LLIV,"Been thinking about purchasing the full series for a while, but I was quite apprehensive about getting it online. Not knowing if I'd receive it or if it would be damaged in the mail, all those worries that kept me from re-watching this series. Then I finally gave in and began to browse the deals here on Amazon. Careful to buy from someone with a 90% or above rating and getting the New or Like New. I lucked out. Got here very quick without having to pay for special shipping. Was sent to the correct address even though I provided multiple addresses (each address depending on what they sent it through). Watched the whole series again with no jumps, scratches nor fusses. Great service, will buy from here again :)

This series is not for everyone. It is a tad slow seeing as it is an older series. But if you come to it with open arms and just sit back with your feet propped up, I'm sure you'll fall into it. The characters...yes they are quite the strange bunch, each is odd or quirky in their own way. Enough to either make you want to strangle them or hug them to death. Set in space, these ""cowboys"" aka bounty hunters, live off their job and love every minute of it...as long as there's food involved.",1336003200,,1212,4.3628318584070795

1821285,5,B00007LLIV,"The problem with getting called the greatest ANYTHING of all time is everyone starts looking for flaws. It makes you a target for anyone trying to bolster their own opinion of themselves.

""This thing that everybody loves, is not good enough for me. People are sheep. I'm enlightened.""

When half the time, the little snots don't know what they're talking about. Sure, there are sycophants out there propping up the ordinary into extraordinary levels. But, when a something reaches universal critical acclaim, chances are you should believe the hype.

Cowboy Bebop gets called ""the Greatest Anime of All Time."" With a title like that, audiences might expect the secrets of the universe, or ecstasy for the senses. Then they're disappointed when the series doesn't match their baseless expectations.

Cowboy Bebop is about a group of bounty hunters. That it takes place in space doesn't matter. Most episodes center around hunting for bounties, while the astute viewer is left alone to piece together the snippets of the characters pasts. There are no flashback arcs because their past doesn't matter. It's the present that's most important. Hunting for bounties is what they're supposed to be about.

Most episodes are one-off stories. ""Done-in-one,"" it's an under-appreciated style. Anyone can meander around for +50 episodes chasing maguffins into eternity. It takes talent and dedication to deliver a compelling narrative in 22-minutes, once-a-week. It's that once-a-week factor that often get ignored. There was a time before everything was guaranteed to be on DVD. Even if you watched it on Cartoon Network, there was still a whole day between episodes to let the themes set in. Nowadays, people inject them into their eyeballs like a junkie. Marathoning what was never meant for you to marathon. Then they criticize Bebop for being twenty episodes of filler.

Filler! Go watch Bleach, then tell me what filler is like. Fact is, Cowboy Bebop has more quality in two-episodes than some shounen have in an entire arc. People focus purely on ""story,"" when the medium is more than that. You need to marry story, acting, animation, and music to be heralded as the ""greatest anime of all time.""

It's not much of a review. You don't need a review when you've got over a hundred perfect scores. I'm not implying that long forms of narrative are bad. Just that Bebop's episodic nature is part of its strength, not weakness.

Now, I'll end this with a warning. Bandai is getting out of the DVD business. Once their old stock is gone, they're going to start licensing their titles away. Bebop will get licensed, for sure. It's not going away any time soon. But, there's no guarantee they'll keep the special features from this set. They could just cut them out for disk space. If you've been waiting to get this set, time is running out.

But I'm very disappointed with the video quality: it shows dot-crawl and rainbowing everywhere.

All it was required to clean the dot-crawl and rainbowing was to recapture the LaserDisks and pass the image through a comb filter, as explained here:

I think the story is trying to say no one is perfect not even the good guys.

You get allot of action and space action, with allot of Sci-Fi aspects and some Crude humor.

Each Character is unique in this anime, Although the story dose not go very deep into each one's back story it dose tell you how they all fit together.

Over all this is a Sci-Fi/Action Anime and IMO it is a acquired taste that fits my taste and will watch this anime over and over again.

1821331,5,B00007LLIV,"A lot of people like to wax philosophical about Cowboy Bebop.  For a lot of people, it was one of the first anime series we saw on Adult Swim a decade ago.  Anime was, largely to the more general American audience, Dragonball Z, Akira, and a bunch of giant robots, women with cat ears, and some very strange motifs.  Bebop is... wholly different.  There's a little flavor from more regular anime in there, but the kinds of themes within Bebop (fatalism, existentialism, moral relativism) are a grade apart from a lot of other series.

Set in the backdrop of our local solar system just 60 years from now, the story of Spike and Jett unfolds, first meeting Ein the datadog, then encountering the unforgettable Faye Valentine, and then finally finding Ed.  And we've got our Cowboys - bounty hunters, in this case with mixed pasts and generally with a collective understanding that what is right is the thing that must be done.  There are two kinds of episodes within Bebop: the more episodic adventures, and then the mythology.  Often times there are subtle references to the overarching story, and we'll get just a snippet of detail.  Other times... well, other times we get an avalanche.

A remarkable feature of the series is the soundtrack.  Yoko Kanno put together The Seatbelts, and the show boasts 3 primary soundtracks plus the movie OST, some EP-like releases, and an expansive box set of four disks.  It winds up being several hours of material, heavily influenced by the likes of Coltrane and Miles Davis.  This is not the soundtrack one expects to hear in anime (or at least did not expect to).  It's more than a bunch of cheeky, notable themes; what Bebop boasts is a full soundscape that, while heavily jazz, also pulls from rock, metal, and classical.

Long story short: this is an anime that everyone should see.  This is the type of anime that helps people who would not consider themselves anime fans (like me) gain exposure to a fairly unique genre, and which has arguably shaped other series in a very positive way.",1317513600,3,2034,4.719546742209632
1821332,5,B00007LLIV,"I just finished watching this for the umptieth time and it always leaves me feeling the same way. That is, I begin frantically searching the internet in the hopes that there will be another show out there that is this investing, rewatchable, and entertaining. I'm not just talking animated or no, just shows in general. Cowboy Bebop is an animated tv show not to be lumped in with any stereotype, anime, children's cartoon or other. It is not a children's cartoon, it is not important to know that it is a Japanese cartoon so leave your scorn or wild expectations at the door. There is one over arching story, but it only gleams through 5 episodes. What is more important is the character development, the pacing, the music that binds it all together and the animation. Pacing and natural drama is something that drives me nuts when done poorly. I have a terrible habit of looking through people's top lists of things and whenever I stumble on a best anime list or general animated feature list and the subsequent comments after, I nearly pull my hair out with the idiotic idea that animation is meant only for children as if live action shows are any more true to life or that shows meant for children are classics to be enjoyed throughout your life from childhood to adulthood. Most shows are meant for children, most shows are stereotypical. The trend to include gratuitous amounts of fan service, slow meaningless screen shots, jargon and flashbacks (pick your poison) in anime has killed the genre as of late-- and the general attitude of American adults towards animation and tv censorship has always been a big obstacle for animation studios. Cowboy Bebop is a modern classic that will very seldomly repeated. If you aren't 10 years old or aren't perpetually stuck in a state that is, purchase, sit back and enjoy. Bebop can be enjoyed one episode at a time. No need to watch 3 episodes to glean one episode of activity. Each episode is standalone. You can pop in any dvd and enjoy an episode without having to know the story, just the characters. One of my favorite things to do is come home after surfing in cold water at the ass crack of dawn, get comfortable with some coffee and a giant breakfast burrito and pop in an episode of Cowboy Bebop. By the time I finish the episode and my burrito I am blissfully food coma-d, passed out with my head back. And it has been a perfect day already. Don't even have to do anything for the rest of the day. That's it, the perfect saturday.",1317340800,,2490,4.585201793721973
1821333,5,B00007LLIV,"Let me digress, I have never actually watched a full anime. I watched Cowboy Bebop the movie when it was on Netflix just some random night. I really liked the movie and decided to buy the whole series. I'm glad I did.

I will say this is not the ""best anime ever"" (simply because I haven't seen EVERY anime), I will say this is a VERY good show. The setting takes place in the 2070s where no actual set government is abound. We follow our bounty hunters (Cowboys) Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and their loyal (and super smart) dog Ein on the spaceship known as the ""Bebop.""

I will say this, the show does not follow a straight plot. Only a few episodes are really part of the main overall show. However, as I have watched this 26 episode (sessions) series, every episode does carry with it the overall theme of the show.

IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS ---> READ THIS PARAGRAPH
  If there is one thing to say about Cowboy Bebop it is that you will gain a different perspective on things (and probably an appreciation for Jazz music) when the entire series is watched. The anime, which can be frivolous and ""colorful"" at times, does have a very serious adult theme overall. By the end of the series, I promise you will want more.

1821334,2,B00007LLIV,"I won't say that this series is bad. Don't get me wrong it's good. But it's also overrated. The characters aren't that deep and they don't have much of a background. There are a lot of cool episodes with some nice action sequences. And of course some comic relief. But that's about it.

The storyline is very simplified. The show has like 30 episodes and only a fourth of the episodes atually move the show forward. The main female lead is basic and the creator tried to draw some sympathy towards her (Faye Valentine) but failed because it's hard to care about a whiny character no matter how good she looks.

The good things that came out of this show were the androgynous character Ed and the dog Ein. The were my two favorite.

This show aired on T.V. around the same time as Outlaw Star. And I must say I like Outlaw Star better from my childhood. Another important note about this show is that the ending is extremely depressing and grim. It's tragic and it kind of rubbed me the wrong way with the combination of the pointless bounty hunter episodes.",1316908800,,1057,4.466321243523316

There's a few parts here and there the sound levels seem to be off, not many, not bad enough to make it a bad experience but they're there. The opening sequence looks horrible, all the edges and bright areas have a weird look to it. I've played them on 4 different devices and notice the same problems on all 4 of them with the sound and video problems. Final complaint for some reason one of my dvd players won't go pass the FBI warning on disks 2 and up, disk one plays fine on it. The dvd player plays everything else fine, it must be something with disks that this particular dvd player doesn't recognize, so if you have this kind of player you may have problems. The brand of the dvd player is Phillips but I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the brand, just wanted to throw it out there in case someone has the same issues with the brand.

You will find yourself hard-pressed not to walk away at least liking one of the characters in the show. Spike and Ein (the Dog) top the list. It definitely satisfies both the anime and non anime fan. The stories, even the very few fillers, will leave you thinking about things in real life. Story is definitely relevant to current events now.

1821350,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is a thrilling, stylish ride. It doesn't tell a story that encompasses things we haven't seen before. What it does it take an episodic approach to the story telling and interweave them between the intricate and ultimately fulfilling relationships between the four primary characters and a few other major characters such as Vicious/Julia. You'll find betrayal, romance, friendship, all the great human themes here. Bebop is not just renowned because it offers something new, it's brilliant because its execution is better than just about any movie or anime series I've seen (it plays out more like a play than your typical series). It develops characters over time and engages the user with entertaining back stories or conflicts.

Bebop to me, is not just a powerful series because of what it presents (its music should be owned, it's super good). Bebop is x1,000 fold more powerful because of what it doesn't do. The story plays out in a particular way, quite different than most series and the ending is always one of the most powerful themes I've come across in a series. :)

1821355,3,B00007LLIV,"I'm somewhat new to anime, and trying to find some good series to watch.  Most people here on amazon praise this as one of the best, if not the best, anime series ever.  So of course this is one I decided to check out.  From the first episode to the last I was disappointed.  The animation is kinda weird to me.  The way the characters are drawn.  Overly tall and lanky.  Kind of anorexic and disproportioned.  Thats not such a big deal, but the episodes are boring too.  I think the main reason its boring is that each episode is its individual stand-alone story.  So obviously theres only so much you can do in a 25 minute episode!  The episode barely starts to develope, and then boom the situation is resolved and the epidsode is over.  Onto the next!  I couldn't really get interested or pulled-in to this show at all.  After watching this series, and considering this is suppose to be one of the best, my excitment of getting into anime dropped.  But fortunately my hopes were renewed again with the next series I proceeded to watch, The Death Note!  Dont get me wrong, Cowboy Beebop isn't total garbage, but it was kinda hard for me to finish this series as it just wasn't too interesting to me.  On a positive note, there is an episode where everybody on the ship is eating shrooms and halucinating/tripping out.  That was hilarious and had me cracking up!",1310515200,,1364,4.475609756097561
1821376,5,B00007LLIV,There are a lot of reviews on here so I will be brief: simply put Cowboy Bebop is not only one of the best anime series or movie I have ever seen but more accurately it is maybe the best piece of cinematic storytelling I have had the pleasure to watch.,1309996800,,252,3.9607843137254903
1821377,5,B00007LLIV,"I have Loved this show since I was a kid watching it on Toonami. It has the perfect blend of Drama, Action, Comedy, and even Romance, all of which are pulled off in an artistic and creative way. This is one of those shows that you feel cool just watching. As far as the quality of the show, I have nothing to say less than ""Absolute Perfection.""

Now for the Remix Box set: I was shocked when I found such a great deal on a remastered box set right here on Amazon. I ordered it after reading a few reviews and I must say this collection does not disappoint! The remastered audio is very crisp and gives the series the sound it has always deserved. I didn't notice too much difference with the picture, but the subtle change is refreshing. The box and disk holders within are actually just fine (from my experience.) They do the job like they are supposed to and aren't hard to open.

I strongly suggest this purchase for any Bebop fans that do not yet own the series. I am very happy that I got it and any other die-hard fans out there will be too.",1307491200,,1048,4.208955223880597
1821378,3,B00007LLIV,"Let me start by saying I am nowhere near an anime expert.  I was only introduce to it a few years ago back in college.  Because of this, I realize I am unable to pick up on some of the nuances of a series that can give it an extra edge.  So for those who are seasoned anime fans, forgive me if my parts of criticism seem a bit clueless.

Pros:

I loved the characters.  This is genuinely one of the few animes I have seen where there is no character that actually annoys me.  Each character brings something to the environment of the show.  I loved the smaller elements of development.  As one other commenter on here put it this anime understand the idea of ""Show rather than tell""  (I feel it may do this to well, but I will get to that in a minute.)  In the end, because of the amazing characters, the overall storyline is saved in this anime.

The style of this anime is phenomenal.  How I wish more shows could follow this concept.  The music and the look made me want to soak in every moment of the show.  This simple truth is the style rather than the story is what kept me coming back to this anime.

Cons:

The story felt lacking to me.  I realize that many would entirely disagree with this statement, but as I said before, the style is what kept me coming back for more, not the story.  The reason for this is because there really isn't much of a central plot.  Some stories are plot driven, while others are character driven.  This anime is ultimately a character driven story.  Because of that, it can easily feel as if there is no real drive amongst the majority of the characters.  Also, while the art of show rather than tell is a useful one, this anime relies on this just a little too much.  I realize the creators don't want to spell everything out and that many animes suffer from to much backstory, but I really felt like more backstory could have put the character center story on a higher level.

Some of the episodes felt a little out of place to me.  In a series as short as this I would hope for every episode to bring something new and intriguing to the table.  I expect some more pointless episodes in longer animes, but in shorter ones like this you really should make the most of each one.

While I loved the style to this show I felt that it was missing in some key areas of backstory.  I'm all for some mystery, but this one was pushing it's luck in some ways.",1306972800,8,2392,4.20704845814978
1821379,5,B00007LLIV,"It's truly rare to have such high quality English-dubbed anime; the voice actors of ""Cowboy Bebop"" are some of the best in the business. That aside, there are several factors of this show that break barriers, set precedents, and speak directly to the heart. That's sort of a strange statement given that this is a cartoon about space cowboys from the future, right? Wrong. For one, the characters of ""Bebop"" are so magnificently created; the characters are why people who have seen the show become instant fans. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed, are the most lovable foursome of televsion characters since Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer, of ""Seinfeld."" And I mean that seriously. And Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, the ones behind the terrific music of the show, are absolute geniuses. I have 20+ songs by the Seatbelts on my iPod that I listen to quite frequently. Songs like ""The Singing Sea,"" ""Adieu,"" and ""Rain"" instill such powerful emotions, while songs like ""Tank!"" show just how hip Kanno can be. The music, the characters, the premise, all of it joined together form one of the finest anime ever made; and ""Cowboy Bebop"" is a show I'd recommend to anyone, regardless of age, sex, creed, or race.

Maybe I've been watching CB for too long, the voice of each characters has built its own image in my heart. I'll say the Japanese Spike is more relax, careless while the English Spike is smarter and clear-in-his-head. The good thing is, those are all Spike.

Featuring the voice talent of Steve Blum, it can't get much better than that... but it can! This show tells
the story of the crew of the space Bebop, and bounty hunters.. Its a lot of fun to watch and is packed-full
of action and amazing drama. Moving on to the box itself, its pretty plain, but it is still very awsome, it comes
with a very nice cover art, and six dvds that showcases everyone that is on the bebop. Also the series is 26 episodes
which imo is the best length for one-shot shows, giving it the right amount of time for the story to be told properly.
If you haven't seen this, then you absoloutely HAVE to, if you don't have enough money for this box-set

1821396,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop has such a reputation that it needs no introduction, and it certainly doesn't need me to write in my review how phenomenal it is.  That some people can rate the show itself poorly is a mystery for the ages.  As for THIS particular release...

To start, the picture and sound is the best I've ever seen it: I don't know what a blue-ray treatment would do for the picture (whether it would help or hamper it), but, much like the dvd release of Samurai Champloo, I find quality well beyond my standards for acceptable.  And the unforgettable soundtrack sounds as great as I remember it.

The special features though are a little bit odd.  The first disc prominently features an interview and commentary with voice actress Wendy Lee (the voice of Faye).  However, similar commentaries/interviews with the voices of Spike and Jet are nowhere to be seen/heard.  For a Bandai Anime Legends release, this is some of the best special features I've seen yet (in that I was actually interested in watching them), and yet the absence of Spike and Jet pieces make the set feel a bit unbalenced.  In their place you find other interviews/commentaries from various members of the Japanese staff (most notably Yoko Kanno, who was responsible for the music), but it would have been far better to be able to also feature Steve Blum and Beau Billingslea (Spike and Jet respectively) in similar segments.

The only other issue to address is the session 0.  At first glance I assumed this was a prequel to better explain the events that through the series were only vaguely revealed in flashbacks.  This is NOT the case.

Session 0 is a bunch of promo footage of the animators and people working on the series.  I imagine it was shot and shown before the show aired (and thus became session 0) in order to promote the show.  It might be interesting for some people, but anybody who's expecting an extra episode is going to be very disappointed.

To sum up:
The show is phenomenal.
The Quality is Great.
The Special features are above average.
Session 0 is a trap.",1297468800,,2055,4.666666666666667
1821397,4,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is an Anime Classic, and this product packages it together nicely.

The animation isn't ground breaking, but it's serviceable.  The things that set Bebop apart from the crowd is the laid-back bluesy soundtrack (which sounds nice in this release) and the general sense of fun that pervades the series.  While there are serious moments aplenty, there's an underlying sense of humour that always made this series appeal to me.  The English language voice talent is very good, and I never feel the need to switch to subtitles that I have when watching some other shows where voice-overs were not well done.

The series' funky music and amazing visual style might give the impression it's all style, but Bebop always has the storytelling chops behind the flash. You follow the crew of the ship Bebop through perhaps one of the most grimey, blue-collar depictions of the future depiicted. The ""cowboy"" theme comes from the wild west mentality found in the crime-ridden reality of our solar system several decades from now. If that sounds too depressing than never fear: the series has a wonderful sense of humor and some episodes are almost entirely comedic, while a few others cross the line into some genuinely frightening horror!

There is also a nice dose of romance and drama.  If you are unsure about buying this product, you will not be disappointed if you do so.  The presentation is great because the six DVD's come in a single DVD box (it takes up the space of two regular DVD boxes if you are worried about size).  The price is a great bargain.

1821458,4,B00007LLIV,"Before it was a household word for anime and animation fans, ""Bebop"" referred to a style of fast-paced Jazz marked by virtuoso performances. If you've ever heard of Charlie Parker or Thelonius Monk, they were Bebop gods in their own time. Bebop had a cool, smooth and devil-may-care attitude which still permeates Jazz culture to this day.
Cowboy Bebop takes that atmosphere and runs with it. The story of a ragtag crew of free agents who shuttle around from planet to planet in their ship bounty-hunting is the antithesis of the stodgy Star Trek type of prime directives and military chains of command. There are no captains and no aliens, only a human society in shambles with people living in a frontier of solar-system width here and there in small pockets of humanity.
The series is all about grand gestures and the character archetypes are not deconstructed too much but rather played straight. Other than in the final run of episodes, when they are confronted with the unpleasant feelings the lifestyle they are driven to pursue gives rise to (a lack of attachment to life leading to loneliness seems to be a common theme), the anime is all about cool encounters. Secondary characters are mostly stereotypes, which makes the story suffer in a few points (Gren comes to mind) and don't get much development.
Unlike pretty much any other anime, one of the main calling cards of ""Bebop"" is its music. Composed and played by a Yoko Kanno outfit called ""The Seatbelts"" (a band both in real life and in-universe) it is a blend of many styles. From the urgent and syncopated opening song ""Tank!"", the jazzy-sax-meets-Deep-Forest ""Space Lion"", the Morricone-inspired mock-cowboy themes to the adult rock anthems ""The real folk blues"", ""Blue"" and ""Call me, call me"". The music is cool, atmospheric and played with gusto, full of grand gestures like the anime itself. Small wonder fans of this series cannot divorce the music from the animation or the plot as it's a vibrant, coherent whole.

To sum it up, this is something that no anime fan should skip as it will probably stay with you for a while. For those unacquainted with anime, Cowboy Bebop will be a great start.",1265587200,5,2169,4.830645161290323

This is one of the few amines where dub beats out sub hands-down. It is well-translated and feels very natural - another reason American anime virgins might want to give this series a try. Plus, the voices are just COOL.  The writing is both funny and emotionally engaging. You will really start to care about these characters. Fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly will start to feel at home in this universe very quickly, I think. Lastly, I can't talk about this series without praising Yoko Kano's AMAZING soundtrack.

I was never a huge anime fan before I saw Bebop and really I still wouldnt consider myself a huge anime fan but the thing is most people think anime and they just think ""oh its just stupid cartoons"" or whatever and I know trust me I use to be one of them but after actully opening my mind and giving anime a shot I watched Bebop and I cant get enough of it.  Ive re-watched the series over and over again and I never skip any episodes It really is my favorite show now ever episode is amazing everytime I watch it I enjoy it.  The show has a great cast of characters for those of you reading that don't know the show there names are Spike,Jet,Faye,Ein,and my fav. Ed!!.  The show starts out staring just Spike and Jet who are two Bounty Hunters just trying to make some cash along the way the other characters come into play Episode 2 I believe is when Ein comes into the story Ein is a data dog he is very cute and becomes a close friend to Edward later on.  Episode 3 Honky Tonk Women introduces Faye Valetine to the cast she starts out on a not so good level with the boys on the Bebop but after a few episodes I think they start to like her company even if they would never admit it.  Episode 9 Jamming with Edward introduces Radical Edward she really makes the show in my opinion they show wouldnt be the same without her she adds so much fun to the show I love watching her.  The show is dark,funny,action backed,and has a great story and an amazing soundtrack to boot I really don't know if there is a cd for the music on the show but if there is someone should let me know cause I would love to add it to my collection of Bebop stuff.  So honestly if you think anime is lame like shamefully to say I did at one point you should still give this particular anime series a shot I would recomend it more for older kids like teens and such.  If you don't want to spend the money to buy the Complete Collection with out getting a taste first then I would recomend picking up the Cowboy Bebop Movie its just as great as the show and will definatly give you a good taste and honestly im not sure how anyone could say this is a bad show if someone out there can I would like to hear your reasoning. SO yeah good show buy the series or buy the movie and if you like those buy the manga books there great too.",1257120000,,2463,4.051440329218107

1821485,5,B00007LLIV,"There is alot of moaning when talking about this box set. Mainly people saying that its exactly the same as the original box set and its pointless. That aside, i was so happy to finally be able to get my hands on the complete series without having to pay an extortionate amount of money for it seeing as i missed out the first time round.

Cowboy bebop is one of, if not, the best anime series i have ever seen. Flamboyant style and some great substance mixed in with a fun sense of humour. Good animation even by todays standards. To be honest, it is rare to see a series animated as well as this is throughout an entire season as production values always seem to fall as a series progresses.

- If you have seen it before; this is the same basic package but worth every penny if you have never owned the set.

- If you haven't seen it before; You should have already clicked the add to basket button and bought it lol.",1252800000,,920,4.215909090909091

1821487,4,B00007LLIV,"While I may have gotten this box set elsewhere, I can tell you more about it. First, the commonly known stuff: it's 6 DVDs for a total of 26 sessions (episodes), it's got English and Japanese audio in 5.0 and 2.1 but only English subtitles, and it's total run time is 650 minutes.

Now for the juicyness: some episodes have commentary from the staff. What does this mean? It means that the voice actors themselves commented on the episode. Some episodes have more than one commentary. For example, the first episode has two commentaries, one from the Japanese voice actors of Spike and Jet and another from the English voice actress of Faye. If that weren't enough juicyness, it also contains a bonus Episode: Session 0, which I am not allowed to spoil about.

So, aye, if you liked Cowboy Bebop and were waiting forever for the box set to come out, then why don't you have this yet?",1249948800,49,883,4.547169811320755

1821500,5,B00007LLIV,"Shortly put Cowboy Bebop is one of the very best anime series ever made. The main protagonists, Spike, Jet and Faye, are all colorful and vivid characters that draw you into the story quite successfully.

The way people move, the way people talk, the music and the general setting is downright ""cool"". And not in a ""man, thats coool dude"" way, if you catch my drift. Its more of a refined, controlled and well tasting sort of ""cool"", the one that make you feel ""warm"" inside because you are lucky enough to be sitting with your own copy of this series in your hand.

There are plenty of serious moments and totally hilarious moments to be had while watching Cowboy Bebop. The series is mainly episodic, but does have a strong storyline that unfolds during the series.

You probably should pick up Cowboy Bebop: The movie (http://www.amazon.com/Cowboy-Bebop-Movie-Beau-Billingslea/dp/B00005JMBJ/ref=pd_bxgy_d_img_b) while you're at it. Watch this one between episode 22 and 23. Just be sure to buy the correct region for this movie, as it is one of few movies that used the ridiculous Regional Coding Enhancement (RCE) system that ""naturally"" makes even some ""correct region"" dvd players refuse the disc. Typical business for DRM in other words.

Well, nothing more to say, as there are long, brilliant reviews for this series/movie here already.

Enjoy!

1821501,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop continues to be the greatest anime of all time as far as I'm concerned, followed by Outlaw Star.

This collection is superb.  The entire series ""remixed"" and at a good price, too!  The quality is as good as ever.  I only wish it were a longer series!

1821504,5,B00007LLIV,"There are only two anime series/OVA/movie I've seen.  Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist are the only ones.

Cowboy Bebop follows Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward as bounty hunters aboard the spaceship Bebop.  Now onto the many reasons why this anime series is perfect.

First the story:  Which blends comedy, drama, action, adventure, Sci-fi and even some romance perfectly like no other show.  Most of the series are one episode stories yet I think are all connected in the development of the characters.  The story of each individual episode is done perfectly giving a beginning a middle and end with no lose ends.  The action is brilliant and I still haven't seen anything to compare to it.  Finally we have the last few episodes leading to the ending.  I won't give anything away to the people who unfortunately haven't seen this series, just it will blow you away.

Second the characters:  Again done perfectly.  Each character has their own unique personality who grows as the show goes along.  Spike who used to work for Red Dragon crime organization and his haunted by his past.  Jet a former police officer who is now working with a criminal, and his haunted by the mistake he made in the past.  Faye who awakes from a 54 year cryogenic sleep with no memory of her past, who lives for the moment.  Finally Edward a eccentric computer genius, who ran away from her father.  Each character brings life to the series and draws you in caring about what happens to each of them.

Third the animation:  The animation done by Sunrise is simply brilliant, and is still amazing after 10 years.

Forth the soundtrack:  The music to the series is the perhaps the greatest soundtrack to anime series ever.  It has a little of everything from Rock, classic, Jazz, Heavy Metal and others.  Each adding something extra to the series.  I even have the soundtrack to the series

Fifth the Influence:  Cowboy Bebop has Influenced many series much like Trigun.  Shows like BLACK LAGOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, and others.  I think that's a great compliment.

Overall Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime series and is must to any anime fan.",1240704000,2,2118,4.754820936639119
1821505,1,B00007LLIV,"Where to begin on this stinker? For some reason, everyone likes this crappy anime, failing to realize that it has no plot, crap voice acting, cheesy violence, and no nudity, unless you like man-boobs. Every episode involves some sort of emo anorexic named Spike who goes around hunting people while getting shot many times, only to die by getting slashed at the end, Faye, who is just there for some eye candy, Jet, who is useless, and Edward, who is some sort of an autistic savant boy who has spent too much time on the internets. Also the music is crap. Why would you listen to jazz? If Nickelback played music on this show, I might give more stars.

For good anime, check out anything that 4kids, the best anime company ever, made.",1240704000,24,735,4.526315789473684
1821506,4,B00007LLIV,"The only thing wrong with this is that i had to wait about 2 weeks for it, just about the longest i've ever had to wait for something from amazon, which i guess isn't that ba.

This is the greatest anime ever an it's freaking even better now. 6 discs of anime greatness produced amazingly and beautifully clear. wow is all i have to say. i love cowboy bebop!!!!!",1237939200,,362,4.246376811594203
1821507,5,B00007LLIV,"A mix of old-school thriller and action movies all blended with humor and bittersweet look into the past , making this anime a good-for-all show. Simply Ama-zing",1237680000,,161,5.0
1821508,1,B00007LLIV,"This anime wasn't very good. Its quite hard to describe it seeing as the the story is very sporadic and just not very interesting. The main villain has no personality and seems to just want to kill people. One episode might be incredibly stupid(an androgynous child searching for food) while another might be really violent(fat killer assassin in a top hat who cries like a baby). People seem to think that the characters are incredibly developed but there not. There back stories are never really explained, only hinted at, and its hard to care for them because they are all either jackasses, idiots or both. I love humor in my anime but this one just wasn't very funny.

The worst part about this anime is the first episode which is great but basically sets you up for disappointment. I'd recommend passing this anime by, and buying something else.",1237593600,10,850,4.743243243243243
1821509,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is one of those special animes that come around very rarely, its one anime that can attract a vast variety of people, there are so many things to like about the series, my main reason is the action and humor but some people may like other things. There are 26 episodes in all and each one is like a mini-movie of some sorts, and also has there own musical theme thanks to the critically acclaimed japanese composer Yoko Kanno. Cowboy Bebop is very dependent upon its music, and the music is ingeniously organized, whether it be an action packed fight scene or just a mellow cool jazzy hang-out scene, the music sets the standard for the series. The series is beautifully drawn, the graphics are just a sight to see and the charcters move seemlessly natural as if they're real people.

Another thing special about this particular anime series is the english dub. There are some decent dubbed animes but some are just terrible in every sense, but Cowboy Bebop succeeds extraordinary, the voice actors are picked perfectly, this is a series that you would actually prefer the english dub over the original japenese voice actors (well at least in my opinion). I highly recommend this series not just for anime lovers but to anyone who is looking for something to watch something thats fun and exciting. Like I said before this anime can attract anybody plus the price of this box set just makes the deal all the more sweeter, how can you go wrong with that.",1236470400,8,1466,4.638461538461539
1821530,5,B00007LLIV,"It's great having the entire season available at a very reasonable price. I got to re-live each episode with the wonderful music and quirky characters that we all know and love so well. This was the best dubbed anime I've ever come across, even to this day and that's saying something considering this anime is around 10 years old in the U.S. I highly recommend this series to anyone, whether new or old to the anime industry and I can't stress enough how much the music made this series so great for me (I own all the soundtracks to it too).

I would caution that this isn't a series for young kids. It's not Sailor Moon or Naruto. It is violent and has many adult themes that are probably better for people 13 and up.",1235433600,2,719,4.325925925925926

1821532,4,B00007LLIV,"This was the first anime that I ever watched from start to finish and when I first saw it, I loved it. It got me into anime and I'm very grateful to this series for that. It's a sacred cow in the anime world. However, now that I've seen many anime TV series, OVAs and feature films, I have to say that my respect for its quality has diminished, albeit slightly. There are some rather large plot holes in certain episodes (especially Jupiter Jazz parts 1 & 2: what reason was there for Vicious to betray Gren, really?) and some (Boogie Woogie Feng Shui and Sympathy for the Devil, I'm looking at you) don't even make sense. That said, this anime is historically important because it helped to kick off a major anime craze in America that expanded America's anime audience and more importantly, it's quite good overall. The endearing characters' banter, the soundtrack that is still one of the best in anime history more than ten years later and the heart-wrenching ending still hold up to repeat viewings.

1821534,5,B00007LLIV,"It's the future. Mankind has developed hyperspatial gates that allow easy travel in the solar system, but Earth is devastated when a hyperspace gate near the moon explodes. Survivors move underground or out into the solar system as Venus, Mars and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are terraformed. Society has broken down, the police are unable to keep order, and roving bounty hunters (I guess this is where the ""cowboy"" comes in) capture criminals to earn bounties. Enter our heroes, Jet (retired cop) and Spike (retired thug), bounty hunters who roam the solar system in their battered ship, the ""Bebop"". Later in the series they are joined by Faye, a mysterious woman with no past, and Ed, an androgynous genius computer hacker pre-teen orphan, an Ein, a ""Data Dog"" who only uses his mysterious and unexplained data dog skills in one episode.

We follow these characters though 26 episodes which range from serious to slapstick, from sci-fi to western. None of the episodes are throwaways or filler, all the episodes reveal just a little bit more of the personalities of the crew of the Bebop, or serves up a sampling of one or more character's back story. We even see the crew of the Bebop break up and begin to go their own ways at the end.

This series has been over-rated as the best ever. I will say it was probably the best ever in 1998 when it was made. Certainly there have been better animated shows made since, or better stories, but everything came together just right for this show. Good graphics, an excellent sound track, superior voice acting. There is very little CG in the series, most of it was cell animation drawn by hand. The writing, however, is among the best. Finally, at last, we get a sci-fi show where the hero doesn't pull out a ray gun and spend ten minutes explaining what the ray gun is and how it works. The characters use guns and ships the way we use cars and forks, grab it and go, without any exposition about it, and it works. It's nice that the director and writers gave us viewers credit for having enough brains that they don't have to explain every little thing.

But therein lays the only drawback to this series: You pretty much have to watch every episode in order to get the story. I had seen several episodes out of sequence on Adult Swim and it made no sense when seen out of order. There is very little objectionable material in this series. We get a few gratuitous shower scenes with Faye and one scene where one of the bounty hunters interrupts a couple of men in bed together. Aside from this, the violence is the only thing that might give a viewer pause. If you have a problem with gun or knife violence, you might want to give this series a pass, though I'd much rather watch something like this where when somebody who gets shot is hurt or killed than an idiot show like the ""A Team"" where thousands of rounds are fired each episode and nobody gets hurt. Which one will teach kids a better respect for firearms, do you suppose?
The ending of the series is rather poignant. Unlike many other anime shows, Cowboy Bebop does come to a definite end. The show left me wanting more, to know what finally happens to the survivors. And that's not a bad thing.
Is Cowboy Bebop the best thing ever? No, but it is one of the finest crafted anime stories I've seen, and definitely belongs in any anime fan's collection.

1821536,5,B00007LLIV,"This is gonna sound redundant with the other reviews but this is the BEST collection of the Cowboy Bebop series. Every episode is included and has been completely remasterd (it's all the remix episodes) and has a crisp clear picture and perfect sounds.

The episodes range from funny, serious, and some incredibly heart wrenching.  If you enjoyed this I recommend looking at Samurai Champloo as well, another one of Shinchiro Watanabe's masterpieces.

This particular DVD set is affordable with a bunch of extras that any fan would enjoy watching.  The packaging is a nice box set with two flaps that fit the six discs comfortably.  My only qualm is that it doesn't seem that there are any wide screen versions available at all for Cowboy Bebop.

1821538,5,B00007LLIV,"If you're looking at this product, you probably already know whether or not you want to buy the show. So why take the plunge here?

It's simple. The 5.1 Digital Surround Sound is amazing. The new sound remix elevates the series to a whole new level. And at this price, it's worth buying the box set, even if you own the original sessions. (Both the American and Japanese tracks are masterfully done.) Every drop of rain falls, each piano chord, and the bullet shells falling to the ground completely encompass you. This is one of, if not the best, 5.1 digital surround sound re-mixes I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.

On top of that, seeing this on an upscaled 1080p player, I am simply floored. I am going through the whole Cowboy Bebop experience again like it's the first time. Hey, I'm going through the whole ""I'm new to anime but is this good - oh my god this is so, so, so good!"" phase.

It's an easy decision. Plus, at this price, with the extras (see the set description or other reviews for more on that) and the fact that these sets are limited editions, it's absurd not to cough up the Woolong for it.

Oh -- I have to go. I just heard Faye stomp away somewhere past me behind my couch into the bowels of the Bebop Bebop.",1227744000,2,1239,4.304721030042918

""I think it's time to blow this scene. Get everybody and the stuff together. Ok, three, two, one let's jam,""

The main character of Cowboy Bebop is a 27-year-old stoic, laid back, relaxing, bounty hunter who is a genius when it comes to street smarts.  Spike Spiegel is a ground breaking protagonist who breaks the mold of traditional anime heroes.  The wonderful thing about Cowboy Bebop is that it seems as if is geared towards a mature audience without being over graphic or push the proverbial envelope.  With the exception of Ed, the characters of this anime are all over 25 which is a nice relief after watching animes where many of the main characters are either in high school or younger then 18.

I love this anime, which is an understatement in itself.  Now that you can own this series in it's entirety for under 40.00, in one convenient high quality package it is certainly worth it.  Pick up Cowboy Bebop, watch it with a loved one that would not normally be interested in anime.  You won't regret it.",1224806400,,1068,4.638297872340425

So the question is...

Did I send the second copy back (or sell it on ebay or something like that).

Character developement is superb. (You actually feel for the characters after viewing for long enough.)

Soundtrack is original and catchy, and perfect for the Cowboy BeBop universe.

Plot. Well, Spike's a bounty hunter, so we follow his quirky adventures all about the galaxy, a very smooth and entertaining plot up until the grand finale.

Grand Finale, this is one of the greatest and most emotional endings in just about any anime. (Second only to End of Evangelion.) The ending is thought provoking and just a masterpiece.

Picture Quality, is well done and never painful to look at, very beatiful.

Overall. This anime is a perfect 5 out of 5, with a low price tag and Spike and gang who will always be with you even after the final words are uttered.

Some people may not like it because of the loose connections between many of the episodes, or because they were put off by an episode, but that's what made the show great. It's following a randomly thrown together group of misfits on their sometimes wacky, sometimes sad, sometime's boring adventures in space while exploring the characters little by little and coming to a good, though somewhat open ending.

1821559,5,B00007LLIV,"The best anime ever. It has so much jazz influence and culture, It's beautifully old school like your cool cousin who's real refined wears lacoste and drives a bmw. It seems like a real show and has a real view of the world with minorites, poverty, struggle, sex, violence, but has warm undertones and peaceful moments every stereotype and people and thing seems real. All the music is original and the American voiceovers
have legends like steven jay blum and John Billingslea it has a real cool urban feel to it. Like the reason why people pay for 4.00 coffee and listen to duke ellington or wear tight button ups and glamour. Its a real cool show and the movie was good to. It's good for intellectuals and idiots, young and old. You can learn alot from this DVD.",1217980800,,765,4.510791366906475

Also don't forget the movie if you enjoy the series.",1217289600,4,350,4.4
1821581,5,B00007LLIV,"The best thing about this series is it is not your typical anime.  The characters don't have special abilities or powers; they don't fight demons; they don't save the world on a regular basis; they don't rely on magic/spirit energy/chi/ki/what have you; they are just normal people down on their luck, trying to make enough money to survive.  They live day to day, trying to survive their environment, and more importantly, their past.  Although it's animation, it is easy to identify with the characters.  That, and not to mention that the soundtrack is amazing.  Who knew a Japanese composer could take something as American as jazz and make it phenominal?  As a side note, for being made in the early '90s, it doeesn't look dated at all.

I used to stay up late on Saturday nights to watch it on Adult Swim.
In my opinion, This is one of the single-most Interesting Animes i have ever seen.
It definitely has a style all it's own.
Although i must admit, i have never actually seen the whole series, hence why i am taking full advantage of this Great deal. But when i used to watch it on television, whether or not is was a re-run or a new episode, i would stop whatever i was doing to watch it. I never lost interest in it.

The humor of this show is really funny it just doesn't miss a beat. Every character is really fleshed out and every episode is part of whole. I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes hard-boiled detective movies. Even if you don't like anime this series is an absolute gem.,1215648000,,460,4.621951219512195
1821584,5,B00007LLIV,"First of all, I'm not a fan of anime at all, and I don't like TV in general.  I bought this series without hesitation, though, after I watched the movie. If you don't know anything about this, the series director is Shinichiro Watanabe, one of the asian directors the Wachowski brothers approached to direct the short animation pieces that conform ""The Animatrix"", the anime installment of the Matrix franchise. That means: this was done by a heavyweight. Now, if you watch anything related to The Matrix, you'll miss what's important about Cowboy Bebop: sense of humor. These people make one of the wildest mixes of contemporary culture, rivaling with things as big as Tarantino's Kill Bill or Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle. I mean: they go from ""Alien"" to blacksploitation to film noir, to chambara, to Kubrick, to Calvino to Bruce Lee..... They've watched a lot, they've read a lot, they've listened to a lot of music, and they have the wit to make fun of all that. I mean, they don't brag about it, so you're safe: this is not an academic excersise as presumptuous as other TV series. This is just pure fun and good eye candy.",1215129600,,1130,4.678391959798995
1821585,4,B00007LLIV,"First of all, the series itself:

I'm not going to spend my time explaining details about a show you can find on thousands of sites across the net. I will, however, recommend this series to nearly anyone. Cowboy Bebop blends action, drama, comedy, and an awesome story flawlessly and is deserving of 5 of 5 stars.

I'd suggest at least watching the series whether you are a fan of anime or not, and although there are plenty of episodes that are technically stand alone, I for one believe you cannot truly appreciate this powerful series until you watch all 26 episodes in order.

Second, for this individual product:

I rated this four stars primarily because of the packaging. As I said, the series is definitely worth a 5/5, but the packaging could have been better. The case contains two ""pages"" of disks, plus a disk on the inside of the front and back cover. The two disks on the covers are fine, but the four in the pages are very, very difficult to get out. It's possible after a while your disks could be damaged.

You could probably fix the case with a dremel or some sandpaper to the ""latches"" that hold the disk in, but I really don't recommend that. Any dust left in the case could scratch the disks, or you could shave off too much and your disks will be too loose. Your best bet with this set would be to put the disks in another disk case if you have one.",1214611200,2,1371,4.36078431372549

They're cheaper than buying each disc individually and much easier than waiting for some of the discs to be stocked. One WARNING! If you buy a complete set watch it immediately. You have a limited time frame to return the collection, if there is something wrong with it.

Cowboy Bebop is very good. The art is stylish. I love the opening. This is the only series I watch the opening every time. The writing is very good. It is episodic, but they will go into the lives and backgrounds of the characters, in most of the episodes. So, it's not simply run around and catch a bad guy each episode. The other thing I like is a lot of times, they don't win.

Towards the end of the series, they did somewhat of a wrap up on all but one character. It felt complete, but I wanted more. That is something I really like about Anime in general. The good guy doesn't always win and there is an ending. Cowboy Bebop has all of that.",1211760000,,1008,4.217616580310881

My biggest concern when I purchased this set was wondering if it had every episode or was just the ""greatest hits"" version of the series. YES THEY ARE ALL THERE!!! I have wanted Cowboy Bebop on DVD for a while and haven't been able to afford it. All the sets I was finding online were cheap copies or outrageously expensive.

1821602,4,B00007LLIV,"You have probably heard how amazing cowboy bebop is about 10000 times. It is a simply amazing

 You have probably heard how great the music in the show is, and that is probably because it is the best music put in a Japanese cartoon.

 The thing about Cowboy Bebop is that it has the formula that makes any story good, it is about the characters, and how they are human, just like you and me. When you can connect in a simple level to characters, because they are fascinating sure,but also because you can see how they act and react to situations that you can relate to as well.

 The music plays also a great part in this series, adding another character to the gang( be it the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"")because the episodes are driven by it. it is like music in the Sergio Leone movies, where sometimes is part of the background, making you feel the action or the suspense of a scene, and sometimes is in the foreground as being the scene.

 The other great thing about this show is that the sci-fi is not drowning you, the way they pilot the ships makes physical sense , not like say star trek where people press a keyboard and the ship  does a loop, it takes place in the solar system, again not making you deal with aliens and things that don't really make sense, because it is a human interpretation of everything that is out in the universe, and the only time it does deal with something somewhat alien it does it in a funny ""alien"" (the movie) kind of way. In other words, this is a show that if it was transported to a cowboy story with the planets being towns and the ships being horses it would make the same sense.

 The only thing that annoys me about the show is that it was not letterbox when it was made thus making watching it in a 16x9 tv a little disappointing, cause you would have to watch it stretched (which looks usually like crap)or having the annoying black bars on the side(which would be the way to watch it) but how could you blame these people for that when the series is from 1998? well I do anyways.

 The remix version has 5.1 sound which makes sense  since the music plays such an important role in this show, and a few extras that are defenetly worth watching.

 If you like anime I recommend this show, if you like music I recommend this show, if you like comedy injected action I recommend this show, and I suppose this is for the 3 people that have never seen it (just kidding...) it is truly excellent.",1209081600,3,2440,4.283224400871459

1821607,5,B00007LLIV,"Look up the word `cool' in any dictionary and it says ""see Cowboy Bebop""...well, not really...but it should, because Cowboy Bebop is the quintessence of coolness.  If you don't already know, Bebop is a stylish 26-session masterpiece chronicling the thrilling triumphs and tribulations of those space-sailing, chain-smoking, bounty-hunting buddies, Jet Black and Spike Spiegel.  Jet is a bald and burly bonsai tree collector with an artificial left arm and a comma-shaped piece of metal under his scarred right eye. A former ISSP officer--known on his home satellite, Ganymede, as the tenacious ""Black Dog""--Jet is now the owner/pilot/mechanic of the spaceship Bebop.  The wiry gunfighter and martial arts master, Spike, has fuzzy green hair, mismatched eyes and a checkered past.  These two intrepid space ""cowboys"" hop from one astral gate to another to hunt down wanted criminals all across the galaxy, hoping to earn enough woolongs to enable Jet to finally add some actual beef to his famous ""Bell Peppers and Beef"" stir-fry.  In Session 2, Spike and Jet rescue a Welsh Corgi ""data-dog"" named Ein from the notorious pet thief, Abdul Hakim.  In Session 3, they meet up with an unscrupulous Blackjack dealer who turns out to be the infamous yellow-clad femme fatale, Faye Valentine.  And in Session 9, they meet an androgynous red-headed net-diver with an occasionally invisible nose who calls herself Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky, IV.  Only by working together can this motley little crew of hungry hunters overcome the ruthless gangsters, senile chess players, broken showers, biting mutants and bad mushrooms that stand in their way as they attempt to nab the endless lineup of bad guys profiled daily on Punch and Judy's Big Shot television show.

Cowboy Bebop showcases phenomenal jazz music and exquisitely detailed animation that perfectly captures the mean streets and spaceways of a future world that's simultaneously strange and familiar, with technology that's grungy and realistic (like the hardware of the original Star Wars trilogy) and a uniquely multi-cultural cornucopia of characters.  Unlike most animes, Bebop is primarily episodic, so the shows can be enjoyed individually, without requiring the viewer to watch the entire series in one sitting.  My personal favorite is the suspense-filled horror spoof, ""Toys In the Attic,"" which opens with red-tinged video footage of a dingy tunnel, reminiscent of the long-forgotten Sega CD game, Sewer Shark.

The ""Remix"" of Cowboy Bebop allows you to hear the unforgettably exhilarating opening theme, Tank! (as well as the rest of the exquisitely-scored soundtrack), in speaker-rattling Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.  This affordably-priced Anime Legends set collects the entire Bebop series (not the movie) on six colorfully silk-screened DVDs.  A plethora of special features are included, among them: three English-language trailers for Cowboy Bebop on DVD; four Cartoon Network promos; interviews with Wendee Lee, the voice of Faye Valentine and Cartoon Network producer, Sean Akins; subtitled commentary on Session 1 with the Japanese voices of Spike and Jet, Koichi Yamadera and Unshou Ishizuka; commentary on Session 5 and 10 with Wendee Lee and ADR producer, Yutaka Maseba; a laughter-filled commentary on Session 17 with director, Shinichiro Watanabe, and legendary composer, Yoko Kanno; Session 24 commentary with the Japanese Faye, Megumi Hayashibara, and the Japanese Ed, Aoi Tada; a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Cowboy Bebop, called Session 0; plus a music video featuring the full-length version of Tank!  Audio options consist of the aforementioned Dolby Digital 5.1 mix in both English and Japanese, as well as the original English and Japanese Stereo tracks.  The ONLY downside to this release is that all six discs are awkwardly crowded into one plastic keepcase, each held in place with tiny tabs that are easily broken.  Shucks howdy, this is an anime collection that would even satisfy those crotchety old geezers, Antonio, Carlos, and Jobim.  So come out of your cryogenic sleep and order yours today!

*Excellent stories.  Many have lots of exciting action.  Many others have lots of comedy.  Others yet have some interesting drama.  Altogether, a fine collection of fascinating sci-fi.
*Excellent characters.  All four main characters receive good, deep development.  Not to mention, Spike is cool.
*Also lots of memorable bad guys.
*Good visuals, good animation quality.
*Good sound design.
*Excellent music.
*Interesting style.  It must be 60% sci-fi and 30% film noir, and 10% western.

The Bad Things
*A few episodes I don't really care about.
*Can get a little goofy.

Definately one of the best anime shows of all time, and should be considered one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.  It has enough action to outdo most others, anime or otherwise.

For those who have not seen Cowboy Beebop, just know this is one of the monumental, classic works in the genre. Every good anime collection should include this series.

Without giving much away: Spike is the main character, a bounty hunter that seems he could have been related to Han Solo!  His right hand man, Jet, and a great cast of main characters help round things out.  Plus an amazingly cute Corgi that looks just like mine!

The story is fun and upbeat with a lot of action as well as some comedy.  It seems no matter what Jet and Spike try, they always end up worse off than before and flat broke to boot.

The animation is getting a little dated, but is still high quality for hand drawn (so much is computer enhanced now days).  Each episode is pretty much free standing until the last few, so missing an episode here or there is not going to ruin the show.

1821634,5,B00007LLIV,"I've seen some of the episodes on cartoon network's Adult Swim, but I never really had the chance to watch the entire thing because usually they would always have re-runs of this show. The series of Cowboy Bebop is about 3 bounty hunters, a super genious dog, and a hacker who acts like a cat! Together they struggle in their futuristic world of space with a little mix of the western world, jazz, and people that mostly live on other planets like jupiter, saturn and mars.

  Their job is to capture their bounty, turn them in, and collect the reward, though sometimes it doesn't always work since they end up accidentally killing their bounty or that they commit suicide for alot of reasons that our bounty hunters do not know of. Sometimes they'll come home with nothing else to eat but the same god damn food that their tired of eating almost everyday!

  But later on in the series each characters tormented past is revealed. The past is really sad to look back to even for the characters of the show. About one who used to work for the police agency, one who lost her memory in an accident 50 years ago ( I think it was), and a man who can not wake-up from a bad dream.

  I gave it a 5 star because the story and the animation is really good as well as the music made by one of my most favorite artists Yoko Kanno. The rating of the show would be Teen or TVMA since it has violence,nudity (only in one scene because a man has the body of a woman), and involves drugs( the people in this show smoke alot). All in all, I recommend anyone to buy this. It was a wonderful show for me when I watched it",1203724800,,1604,4.232786885245901
1821635,5,B00007LLIV,"Instead of giving some hack review of the story, I'll skip it and assume you either know the story already or know how to google for it.

This box set of a solid anime is finally released in its newest form (improved and cleaned-up picture and 5.1 surround mix) at a very affordable price. Honestly, $40 is a steal considering what you had to pay for all of the discs individually. All 6 discs are in a clamshell case, similar to that of the Back to the Future. No insert inside, just the DVDs.

What I think of the improved picture:
It's not bad. Not perfect but not bad. You'll notice the picture is cleaned up a lot if you compare it with pre-improved releases. Scenes that are brighter or more colorful really come through. But I did notice something that kinda bothered me some. Scenes where there is a lot of black (which are many; the story is mostly in space. who knew?) seem off. What I mean by that is, the black areas aren't a consistent black. This could be a result of the clean-up process but I'm not sure. Either way, it's slightly distracting but by no means a deal breaker. (EDIT: This was an issue I experienced on the first disc and not later ones; not sure if it was with the disc or my TV's brightness setting. Either way, not a big problem.) You're getting a better copy of the show visually.

What I think of the sound:
Ok, if you know anything about Bebop, it's that there is a great soundtrack. Snappy jazz with the opening credits and sad blues penetrate this series. Needless to say, with a diverse score like this one, the surround mix really pays off. Surround effects and bass response are dead on and not overwhelming. Scenes take advantage of the surrounds to create a balanced ambiance and you might even glance behind your shoulder at times. Don't feel dumb if you do; I did it too. Gunfights and action scenes take good advantage of the subwoofer. But nothing overwhelming, it's well balanced and just gives that extra punch you'd expect.

So what should you do?
If you don't have this series, this is probably the best offer you're going to get. If you laid down the money for each remastered disc, nothing is added for you content wise, other than your anger for Bandai not releasing this sooner.

A quality series with an upped picture quality and surround mix, offered at a reasonable price. Til next time Cowboy.",1203292800,215,2352,4.473193473193473

While it is nice to have each disk in its own case with the inside material, for the price you have to grab it before its gone.  The series is excellent, the music fits better than almost any anime out there, and you are almost never lacking for action.  The quality of the picture is very good as well.  The only down side... the preview for other anime on all the disks is exactly the same!  I know that doesn't effect Cowboy Bebop itself, but I enjoy seeing what's out there on the preview clips and was aggravated to see the same two or three presented over and over.  Oh well...  Like I said, get it now!",1203033600,,776,4.154362416107382
1821637,4,B00007LLIV,"First of all, let me just say that this is an incredible deal on the Cowboy Bebop series, and you should order it now if you haven't already. 5 star show all the way, and this is less than half of what it used to cost to own the ""remix"" (remastered) version.

However I do have to complain a little about the packaging, more specifically, the spindles inside the case that hold the discs in place. The outward appearance is nice, and the design concept is a pretty good idea, but it has one fatal flaw in my opinion. When you open the case, there are two ""pages"" that hold four of the discs, the other two discs are held in place nicely on the inside front/back covers. The spindles on the pages do not have a very good release mechanism and you have to force (bend) the discs to remove them. This can cause the discs to delaminate, which means they might split in half since they are two pieces of polycarbonate bonded together (bending will stress the glue used in the bonding process and it will eventually lose it's grip). All DVDs are manufactured that way, so it's not that these discs are bad quality...they are the same as any other DVD. In case you're confused, you might want to look up how DVDs are manufactured and proper DVD care...it might explain better than I have here.

Luckily, I had a few spare cases and am using those to store the four discs that were on those funky pages (two discs are still in the original case). It should have been designed better, but I can't say that I'm surprised. For this price I guess they felt they had to cut costs somewhere.

Summary: 4.5 stars - Overall, this set is totally worth it. I would have given it 5 stars had the packaging been up to snuff, but this is such a good deal that it still would have been worth it had they shipped the discs in folded newspaper. It used to cost well over 100 dollars to own these 6 remix sessions...now it's under 50. And yes, these are the exact same discs as the ones sold separately for more money.

After watching Cowboy Bebop, I spent a disproportionate amount of time looking for another anime that could, perhaps duplicate its achievement, but so far I haven't even been able to come up with a close second.

No, silly girl, a present for me. A box set version of the jazzy cool anime Cowboy Bebop that's 130 bucks off the individual remix's list.

A slick show with great characters; I like Spike's apathetic melancholy that just doesn't quite hide his intense enthusiasm and Faye is back-stabbing, two-faced, and manipulative but then seems genuinely surprised when people get in her face about it.

I remember watching this when it FIRST came out years ago and I was blown away. This is that series that is so hip and cool and so well done that you can pretty much show it to someone who has NEVER seen an anime before and they will like it too ie, your mom, a date, etc.

1821662,5,B00007LLIV,"In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop is never going to reach the psychological devastation of Evangelion. However, this series is still popular, because characters in Bebop fight courageously for justice, even when hope seems far away.

Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are two bounty hunters, turning criminals in to the police for rewards. Faye and Ed join them later on in the series. Although the four frequently run out of food, they form an irresistable family, even when money is hard to come by.

This series has everything, from science fiction to romance to rough action. Most of all, this anime is about Spike's freedom from his tumultuous past as an assassin of the Red Dragons, the corporate yakuza group aimed at gaining power over the universe. His girlfriend, Julia, is definitely worth fighting for.

The other characters also bring their own unique histories as well. Faye Valentine she lost her memory fifty years ago in an accident in space. Fifty years later, when Faye awakens from her cryogenic sleep, she finds herself in a world where cars have been replaced by flying spaceships. Her shock is not unique--it is the shock that many Japanese have had at the evolution of Japan into a humongous industrial machine.

Finally, Bebop has some of the most hilarious comedy episodes. Two notable episodes, ""Mushroom Samba"" and ""Cowboy Funk,"" have the craziest situations ever seen in anime. In ""Mushroom Samba,"" Ed captures a mushroom smuggler in the wackiest train chase, featuring African-American bounty hunters with names taken from Blaxploitation movies such as ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Shaft."" The other episode, ""Cowboy Funk,"" involves Spike and his ordeal with a cowboy on a horse with missle launchers. Yes, he's a cowboy on a horse in the future, upholding the traditions of the Western past. Don't ask me how he got in there. He's just there.

If you're an anime fan who still hasn't seen Cowboy Bebop, pick it up immediately. This is an excellent action series that cannot be missed.",1202342400,3,1994,4.975975975975976

Memorable characters. Spike is my favorite anime character of all time; my Spike Spiegel Messenger Bag might just be one of the best purchases I've ever made.

Awesome music. I listen to the soundtrack every single day. The jazz is amazing, as only Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts could make such a spectacle. It's the main reason for my favorite radio station being CD101.9

My two cents involves the sequence of how you watch this series.  I watched it all on Adult Swim before actually purchasing the DVDs.  And I didn't always have time to watch each night, so I didn't have a linear viewing experience.  I found this to actually be a good thing.  I don't want to reveal any spoilers, so I'll say simply that my opinion on getting the most fulfilling experience is to watch the first 5 DVDs straight through.  But after that, watch the movie.  THEN go on to the 6th DVD.  You'll understand why once you've gotten there.

You won't necessarily have any less great of an experience if you decide not to do this.  But after having been able to do it this way myself, I can't really imagine it any other way.",1173916800,,894,4.384146341463414

1821672,5,B00007LLIV,"With so many ppl and so many tastes, how do you reckon what is good or otherwise for others? Something is not right with this sorts of review thinggie I feel.

Let me start right away.

First of all, this is me - I'd give :

5 stars for ""Seinfeld""

0 stars for ""A Lot Like Love"" - that Ashton Kutcheroo thing

5 stars for ""Ninja Scroll""

5 stars for ""Blood - The Last Vampire""

5 stars for ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels

0 stars for ""Zathura""

So there, you roughly know my taste.

If you are so opposite of me, than don't believe my comment.

If you are around my preference, then, my account can probably be helpful.

In short, I'd give Cowboy Bebop a 5 stars.

But that does not mean it doesn't come with criticsm.

Maybe the show is okay.

But the fact there are too many parrots here writing really like a parrot, the whole cowboy bebop thing become irritatingly exaggerated. I find the animation is just alright - as opposed to some who claimed this to be one of the best or stunning. ( huh*?! )One of those best would be like that of Appleseed. Plotwise similarly - nothing much to rave about. They're okay - not anything like Ninja Scroll or Princess Mononoke where they really make you sit glued to your chair with a baseball bat in your hand incase someone disturbs your peace. And I read some even went on to brag about the Intro theme ""Tank"". Again, it is just okay - not something I never heard before. Infact, I prefered the saxophone stuffs in Jupiter Jazz than theme intro.

In short, I feel yeah you can have the whole series for a collection - but definitely not my best collection. Oh, and yes I have the whole original 6 cds from Bandai, and I'm not really that proud owning them compared to my other stuffs that I could easily say they are better. But then again, that is if you like and don't like the same things as me. This is my honest opinion about the cowboy bebop thing.

The complete Cowboy Bebop sessions that I have rented and watched many times had something like seven or nine discs and had a beautiful transfer.  The data was crammed onto these discs, much to the detriment of the picture.  Most of the time the picture is quite pixelated, and at others there are white pixels in various parts of Spike's face.  But you get what you pay for. [...] I love the show- and there are maybe three episodes on this collection that have a pretty descent transfer- they look alright.  The transition from the final episode's credits to the menu screen is way too abrupt though.  It seems that a few seconds were shaved off- you know, those fade outs really do make a difference.  If Wantanabe wanted a bump out, there would be one there.  Instead on this version you have the long and beautiful pan up to the night sky on Mars, you see the star disappear, and then BUMP!- CUE ""TANK!"" REALLY LOUDLY AND DESTROY THE MOMENT.

1821674,5,B00007LLIV,"There's a lot in the customer review section here about the authentic version vs. the bootlegs. Having just (inadvertently) bought a bootleg box set (and one of the feature film), and subsequently done some research, here's what you need to know in a nutshell:

AUTHENTIC:

26 episodes on 7 DVDs. Since the authentic disks contain fewer episodes per DVD than the bootlegs, they contain fatter files with more video info, so the resolution is higher. Special features, optional subtitles.

BOOTLEG:

Since the content is not licensed for use in the first place, there are SEVERAL bootleg sets from several different bootleg distributors. Some don't work well, some (reportedly) don't let you flip off the subtitles, some (reportedly) have conspicuously low resolution. In ALL cases, the episodes are contained on FEWER discs (3 in most cases), and this is apparently the most obvious evidence of bootleggery, though there are others.

The set I have -- a three-disk fold-out in a sturdy plastic sleeve, front panel showing a sepia toned picture of all the regulars, very understated presentation of basic title-text -- is apparently the most common bootleg set, as well as the best. It displays no releasing label, no DVD logo, and the small print IDs the disks as ALL code, undeniable bootleg indicia. The disks start playing episodes immediately, without the usual studio intros and menu display, which has made some believe there are no special features. In fact, there are -- and a traditional menu, too, but you have to press MENU on your remote to get to it. The special features have no English soundtrack, nor English subtitling. As to the episodes themselves -- they're all there,  in roaring Dolby surround. Per warnings,  the video resolution is, indeed, a bit lower than the best DVD fare. It's about on a par with good VHS, and despite some pixillation here and there, sharper than all but the very best VCDs.

  If this is the bootleg set you're dealing with, and you're not obsessive about the finest points of picture quality, the compromise will barely make an impression on you. If this is NOT the bootleg set you're dealing with, you're in danger of  not merely getting ripped features, but substandard ones (i.e. badly translated subtitles) -- again, reportedly.

  Note that most of the ""new and used"" sets on offer here ARE 3-disk bootleg sets. Ideally, and for all sorts of moral and legal reasons, we really ought not to support their sale ... but authentic anime releases are SO unusually expensive, that yielding to temptation is not altogether indefensible. At least it sends a message to the official distributors that their prices might be commensurate with other commercial fare. That being the case, make sure you know WHICH bootleg set you're getting before you buy. There's no point sending a message that'll only bite you in the butt for your trouble.",1126483200,7,2884,4.95643153526971

First off it's true some of them out there are of poor quailty and sound. Which is why it's better to get them from actual companines like ADV, Pioneer, Bandai, and etc. But on the other hand some bootlegs are actual good for example I went and bought the whole Ranma 1/2 set for $140. Of course I knew it was bootleg I was just curious to see what the quailty was and to my surprise it was great. The discs came in a fold out design with beautiful pictures not to mention the disc came with features just like the ones you'd buy from the legit companies.

1821700,5,B00007LLIV,"Over and over I have enjoyed the bounty-hunting antics of the Bebop crew on late-night Cartoon Network.  Yes, this colorful band of bad-guy hunters has fueled my addiction for Otakudom ever since I started watching anime about two-years ago.  However, analyzing what makes Cowboy Bebop tick isn't hard to do once you've compared the series to other single-season animes.

First off is the story.  I have to admit that the most appealing aspect of CBop is its ability to never grow old.  No filler episodes here.  Each 25-minute block is attractively constructive in its own way.  Intricately woven throughout is a carefully strewn network of character developments, action, hinted romance, guns, die harder grunges and oh yes, sweet sweet revenge.  The consummate animated brainchild, CBop is a God-like blend of hand-drawn and CG'd animation.

Yoko Kanno's musical genius adds in large part to the popularity of CBop.  The wide-reaching aspects of her tones create a unique musical blend.  It's like listening to an IHOP pancake menu.  All international flavors enjoy conscience throughout Cowboy Bebop's musical backdrop.

Character strength is also a major draw on the CBop fan base.  There's Spike; the past conscious, reclusive Bruce Lee figure.  Jet; the unheeded wise man who likes to cook.  Faye; the stubborn, yester-life hunting hottie.  Ed; the 13-year-old, contortionistic computer-whiz.  And Ein; the super-smart dog with no canine instincts.  But despite their cultural and sociable discords, they find that they work as smoothly as a first date at a Blues review; complete with impromptu conversations and ""weird""-moments.  But they'll grow on each other and the viewer like a hypnotic drug-fungus that may possibly cause gleeful-addiction via endorphin release.

A must-watch, must-own and must-experience anime that anyone who dares to call himself/herself an Otaku must see.  All in all a suburb anime with more retina-pleasing candy than Wonka himself could shake his big shiny walking stick at.",1098489600,,2014,5.36741214057508

Knowing that it was a bootleg, I was impressed: it comes in a box set with 3 DVD disc, and the box set alone is worthy to be displayed. The quality of the movie isn't too great, but nevertheless, I was very happy. The quality of the movie isn't horrific either. The video quality is about the same as a VHS movie, which is pretty good, if you ask me. Theres a couple of scenes that get a little blurry, but the picture is still viewable and it's nothing I would complain about.
Trust me, this version is well worth it, especially with all the money you will save. And if you're (the fellow reader) a Cowboy Bebop fan, you should definitely order this movie, no questions asked (they were already answered, right?). Just order it. Pronto! :)",1080691200,,886,4.343373493975903

I watch some TV anime on adult swim but never really get into it because you really have to watch the full series in sequence to understand anything.  Based on that, I was a little skeptical about Bebop, as I had seen a couple episodes out of context and wasn't impressed.  This box set really blew me away.  The animation, themes, charatcer developement, the music, every little thing about this is amazing.  The cowboy bebop movie is also very good, but doesn't compare to the series.

1821719,5,B00007LLIV,"Oh...how I hated anime for so very, very long.  Those ridiculously huge eyes, those tiny mouths that expand to be as big as black holes when they talk, those ridiculously annoying voices, those stupid facial expressions...everything about it just drove me up the wall.  But then something happened...after a while of arguing his case, my friend introduced me to a show called Cowboy Bebop...a Session entitled 'Ballad of the Fallen Angels' to be precise...and in one instant, I was turned.
Everything you hear about Cowboy Bebop, in one way or another, is true.  It is THE anime that even anime haters can enjoy, and in some cases, such as mine, convert those haters into anime lovers.  Cowboy Bebop has some great animation, combined with a great soundtrack and excellent story.  Each Session is your average 25 minutes, spanning 26 Sessions.  Though most of the Sessions are not connected by any means, despite the occasional Session that furthers the story of main character Spike and his past with the Red Dragon Syndicate, there is enough character development throughout the show to make you really care about the crew of the Bebop.  The Sci-Fi outer-space bounty hunter setting is great, and is a unique blend of present day real-world/futuristic sci-fi setting.
Each character of the show has their own little quirks and attitudes, which is basically the driving force of the show.  The grizzled Jet, cool and controlled Spike, sultry and greedy Faye, the 'wonderdog' Ein, and the annoying but useful Edward all bring a unique personality to the show.  Ironically, I found myself liking Edward very much, despite the fact that she represents everything I once hated in Anime...thats how well the characters are developed.  The voice acting is oustanding, fitting each character well and making their personalities that much more beleivable.  Many of the side characters are entertaining, and the villains are some of the most sinister and creative I've seen in any form of entertainment.
Even though not all the episodes are as spectacular as 'Ballad of the Fallen Angels', they're all pretty good, and some are even better, but I favor Ballad mainly because it was the Session that changed my view of Anime as a whole.  The show has its fair share of violence, gunplay and bloodshed, with plenty of sexual innuendo, action, drama and comedy.  Some of my personal favorites include 'Venus Waltz', 'Blackdog Serenade', 'Cowboy Funk' and of course the 2-part final episode 'Real Folk Blues', which is among the best I've ever seen in any anime.
Describing it does it no real justice, since you need to watch Bebop to understand how great it really is.  Is Bebop overrated?  Well, yes and no.  I can see how some may hold Bebop much higher than it should be, but it is very deserving of all of its praise.  It converted me, and I know i'm not the only one who has been converted by Cowboy Bebop.  Its been over a year since I was introduced to Bebop, and since then I have watched and enjoyed many different Anime.  My narrow-minded view of anime has changed dramatically, and while definitely not an 'Otaku', I definitely do consider myself a big fan of Anime, and I owe it to Bebop.  Anime-haters and critics, even if they aren't turned into fans by watching Bebop, will at least have to acknowledge just how good the show is, and how it definitely does live up to its tagline as being in a genre all its own.  Cowboy Bebop is definitely one of the greatest anime in our time, and though there may very well be much better anime out there, Bebop is definitely something special in itself.",1074470400,5,3595,4.7941653160453805
1821720,3,B00007LLIV,"If you're not an anime fanatic and are trying to decide if this set is worth your bux, than this review is for you.
I buy an assortment of sci-fi, fantasy and anime so I try to be reasonable about what makes a quality series. It makes no sense spending time and money on hype right? So here it goes...
The animation(think Vampire Hunter D,Bloodlust, Macross Plus or Ghost In The Shell), dvd packaging and dvd features of this set are top-notch. The animation obviously took a lot of work and could be a case study in itself on how to produce a quality anime.
The soundtrack is ok, nothing special. On any other dvd series, the soundtrack would be annoying and/or boring but it works well enough on this set. After finishing the 6 dvd set and hearing the music, I didn't feel like I had missed anything by not having purchased the 6 dvd +1 cd set that had been on sale earlier. If the music wasn't associated with Cowboy Bebop, I don't think it would ever find its own audience, even on the underground scene.
Unless you're obsessive about voice actors, the voice work is pretty good. I thought the character voices matched well enough and didn't detract from the series.
So why 3 stars? Well depending on what you're looking for, this might not be for you. I like ""serial"" series, like Escaflowne or Record of Lodoss War, where the episodes build on one another and you feel a sense of anticipation and want to watch the next episode. This series, (coincidentally?) reflecting the characters personalities, kind of just ambles along. There are a couple of episodes that are 2 parters but the rest are mostly random storylines. A lot of the episodes have scenes featuring the characters just lounging around on the ship trying to figure out how to make money. This got really boring after a while. How many different times did the writers need to convey that the characters were starving bounty hunters? I think most people would understand the first couple of times.
Don't get me wrong the episodes are fairly decent on their own. It's just the case that if you have 26 episodes in a series, then you expect a fair amount of variation, not just a bunch of stories that do little to flesh out the characters or the world in which they live. I had actually stopped watching this series halfway through because there was no compelling(emphasis on compelling) reason to continue. Farscape, the series, is an excellent example of how to develop characters over time without giving away everything in the first season.
Here's a quick run down of the characters:
The Ed character was the equivalent of Jar-Jar binks from Star Wars. Ed's only saving grace was his(her?) ability to hack the net when the crew needed information. They never fully explain that ""data"" dog(you'll see).
The Spike character strikes the pose(vogue) constantly and is virtually invulnerable. This takes a lot of the (good) tension out of the fight scenes. If you're going to make a character virtually indestructible, then you need to make the character vulnerable emotionally (a good example of this is D, from Vampire Hunter D or Gul(sp?) from Macross Plus)
The Faye character(scantily clad woman trying to win in a man's world, using her looks to mask her brain) has been done ad nauseum in other series. The Jet Black character is intriguing though. He's painted as a decent man who's just trying to get through life and do the right thing. One of the better episodes sheds light on his past.
So was this series worth the price? With respect to the animation, audio and production values...yes. But for a good story, solid character development and a cool alternative reality go with Escaflowne.",1073952000,2,3667,4.713395638629284
1821721,5,B00007LLIV,"You're not really reading this are you? Surely you know Cowboy Bebop is excellent, you don't need me to tell you that...
Cowboy Bebop is a true work of art. Complex, and well designed characters who bounce in and out of each others lives as their own needs demand. A fantastic, futuristic universe that's generally worn down and jaded, and seemingly full of criminals. Clever plotlines that are both short lived and for the moment, and long term and character developing at the same time. Incredible production values with a fantastic soundtrack, great art and animation, and a keen eye for composition and design. The english dub is actually pretty good too!
Really, if you like anime, animation, sci-fi, or anything along those lines and have not seen this series then you should hang your head in shame. Then go and buy all six discs and enjoy, it's a great ride.",1072742400,,866,4.741721854304636
1821722,2,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop has A LOT going for it.  An awesome dub, an awesome main character, great music, and AMAZING animation.  However, its lacking a bit plotwise and comes off as rather boring.
The problem probably originates from the fact that its a 26 episode series with no goal.  You can't have 26 episodes without them having some kind of goal to reach! The first episode was great and so were a couple episodes in the middle and the last two episodes, and you know why?  Because they actually followed what little plot this show has. They all revolved around the mafia or gang or whatever that group Spike used to be in was.  The rest are pretty much all fillers.  Prettily animated fillers mind you, but fillers nonetheless, and very slow paced at that!
So anyway, I ended up pretty bored.  Half way through I was bored out of my mind and had to force myself to finish it.  But then of course the last two episodes made me just say ""wow"".
This should have definitely been maybe a six episode OAV.  I think it would have been more powerful and have a stronger story that way.
(and by the way, if its a 200 boxset, and you buy it for 30 from a vender, THEN OF COURSE ITS A BOOTLEG!! DUH!! Its a burned piece of crap from Hong Kong because they didn't sign a contract saying that you can't burn licensed movies like all the other countries did.

But as the series progresses, the past is revealed and the depth of the characters is shown. Starts off with Spike (former syndicate operative) and Jet (former ISSP(police) officer). Jet owns the renovated ship Bebop, and together track and capture bounties. On one of their hunts they had to find Ein (data dog), but decided to keep him. Then came Faye (awoken for deep sleep).

I have only seen the first 9 sessions, but it becomes clear after only one episode that this series is very special and very unique. This show is more relevant, realistic (while still including elements of science fiction), and fantastic than any other anime (and most other animated or live action shows) that I have watched. This is animation approaching the level of art rather than entertainment. This is one of the best examples of how animation can be used as a tool to tell amazing stories that could not be told with live action story telling. This is a show that western audiences should enjoy whether they enjoy other anime or not. Anyone who enjoys drama, action, comedy, or visual entertainment in any form should check this out. This is a show like the Simpsons in that it works on several different levels. It can be enjoyed superficially, or you can analyze it a little deeper and search for the meaning behind each episode as well as the overall meaning that seems to be stretching across the entire series. I dread watching the final two episodes and knowing that the series had ended. I know I'll miss the characters when that happens. Tune into Cartoon Network and check it out. Or buy this set.

1821756,5,B00007LLIV,"As for the series itself, I'll just say it is the greatest series I've seen yet, in so many ways.  The entire show seems like some kind of tribute to several pop culture and media people and films, but beyond that, it also has a plot and characters that seem unique to its own.  Somewhat postmodernist in it's display, it's still easy enough to pick up and watch.
The music is PHENOMENAL.  I've never seen such well done music for any kind of cartoon series, let alone an anime.  The English dubbing for Bebop is also decent, because it looks like they took time to make the animated lips of the speakers match or synchronize well with that of English dialogue.  Normally I prefer subtitles, but this dubbing made the series stand out for me, aside from the music.
Anyway, all in all, if you want to see something that's anime yet less wacked out like most of what's out there, try bebop.  You won't be disappointed if you watch it all.  Nothing is casually thrown into this series and every action, character, and event seems to have a meaning and a purpose on a level above mere fan-service.
The only thing about it that may bore some people is the lack of stupid animation as seen in such laughable series as Trigun.  Trigun, while good, is nothing compared to bebop.  It tries, makes a few good points, then spazzes out, much like it's main character.  But that's not for this review ;-)

The voice acting, from anime veterans David Lucas, Wendee Lee and Beau Billingslea, among others, is some of the best I have heard in an anime; the voices seem natural and unforced.  Also notable is the fact that ""Bebop"" simply oozes style--possibly the most I have seen in any show, animated or not.  That does not, however, imply that ""Bebop"" is just another mindless action cartoon (cough, Dragon Ball Z, cough).  Wantanabe (the director) has a keen grip on symbolism and metaphor a-la-""Matrix,"" so it felt like a breath of fresh air that I was thinking about the anime's themes long after finishing it.

Forget for the moment that CB is animated.  This is great science fiction on par with Farscape and Firefly, Dark City and The Matrix.  It tackles both character complexity and philosophical ideas with equal grace, makes you think while entertaining you to no end...
An as far as animation goes, I only wish there was more out there like it.  Stylish, patient (a sequence where everything is still for a moment as the ice melts and shifts in a glass comes to mind), and lovely to look at... this is very much how the movies in my mind (which become the words on my word-processor page as I write my own fiction) look.  The voice acting on the English version is fan-freakin-tastic -- none of the annoying squeaks and grunts I hate in most anime, none of the cutesy stuff, no ponderous exposition...  just darn good storytelling and great music.  Instead, they take a lot of the clichs (cute kid, for example) and turn them on their head -- when you find out the ""secret"" about Radical Edward, you'll see what I mean...  As for Spike Spiegel, I'm all but in love with the guy...  The legacy of Bogart and Han Solo shines through...  <pause for swoon>
I love it.  This series did for me what The Crow, Sandman, and Alan Moore's work did for comic books: opened my eyes to a whole new world. Because of CB, I'll give some other anime a chance.

The name means nothing.
Cowboy Bebop is, in my own opinion, one of the greatest television -- not just anim -- series ever created. There's a good deal of humor in most of the episodes, and Spike Spiegel, the green-haired man character, just never seems to get a break. There are three things he hates: Children, pets, and bitchy women. And, in his own words, all of them are conveniently packed onto his ship.
An overview: Jet Black and Spike Spiegel are your basic bounty hunters, called cowboys. They're basically having aa easy of a time as you can expect people going after criminals unprofessionally could, and, tada, Spike's past comes into play, and more characters are introduced. It's pretty much appealing to anyone, as the characters range from a talking dog to a quiet ex-cop.

These AWESOME movies in the last sentence pale in comparison to Cowboy Bebop.
Sorry to you Akira/GitS fans out there, but Bebop is the ultimate gritty future anime(note: Vamp is post-apocalyptic fantasy, not gritty future).  If you see it, you will agree with me.
This anime is so good, I don't see why it doesn't have a bigger following.  Just do yourself a favor and buy it, your life will be forever changed.  I watch at least one episode a week (I used to do it daily, but I've seen them all until I can recite the words with the characters, even Edward).
Do yourself another favor and just buy the package right here off Amazon.com  The 3 DVD set looks like a deal, but the voice acting is different (as another reviewer pointed out, thank you whoever you are) and you will be disappointed.

1821777,5,B00007LLIV,"If Neon Genesis Evangelion ranks as the No. 1 anime series ever, Cowboy Bebop would be an easy No. 1.1, wrapped up beautifully in 26 masterful episodes.
Bebop takes place some time in the assumed future: all money is electronically transfered on plastic in the denomination of ""woolongs."" Space travel to different planets is the norm, VHS players and joystick-video games are antiques, and the internet is navigated by goggles. Bebop focuses on one group of people: bounty hunters or ""cowboys"" as they are called. There is even a regular television show that updates cowboys on the best and biggest bounties out there. The best, but unluckiest, of the bunch and Jet, an ex-cop with an artificial iron arm, and Spike, an extremely laid-back, confident ex-gangster, proficient in weapons and judo. Along the way, they pick up Faye, a gambling-addicted babe from the past, freed from her cryogenic sleep; Ed, a tomboyish-girl generally accepted as one of the planet's best hackers; and Ein, a super-intelligent Welsh Corgi (he barks and doesn't talk).
The animation is so spectacular and uninhibited that the feeling of watching anime versus live action is blurred. The camera can go shaking erratically during a crash or hand-to-hand fight sequence; it can go red-tinted and distorted when it switches to the view of a rampaging drug addict; it can flip 360 from the ground to the sky, back to the ground as someone gets thrown; or it can merely show birds flying off into the sky as the report of a gunshot fades. The anime is extremely detailed and the CG moments chosen very wisely. The colors are also well-chosen; blacks and blues for the more brutal flashbacks, or a golden hue for more choice memories. Nothing is accidental; you know they paid great attention when they have Spike's fake eye just a shade lighter of brown than his real eye.
The stories are very-well thought out and choreographed, with each bounty having a significant back story, not just a nameless bad guy or girl. It's fun to see the creative ways the cowboys corner and capture their bounties, or just the mad scramble to recover when their plans go awry. But it's not all just bounty hunting. Spike, the closest thing to a main character, his constantly haunted by a past he has long tried to leave behind, most frequently in the form of Julia, a long-lost love whose story isn't explored in-depth until close to the end; and Vicious, once Spike's right hand man in the gang, equally adept at fighting and coming out of impossible situations alive.
The masterpiece of the series comes in the fifth episode, the first confrontation between Spike and Vicious, that epitomizes all that is cool about Cowboy Bebop. Spike takes on Vicious' entire team of thugs, then battles him one-on-one in scenes very reminiscent of a John Woo flick (i.e. a quick battle, ending abruptly with Spike's gun pointed at Vicious' heart, just as Vicious' saber points digs menacingly into Spike). The action goes into slow motion as Spike falls through a stained-glass window, the haunting ""Ballad Of Fallen Angels"" (choir singing unaccompanied by music) playing, as the camera zooms into his eye and into a flashback.
There are also the lighter, comedic episodes where Ed and Ein watch as Spike, Jet and Faye go through mushroom-induced hallucinations; or when another cowboy, completely oblivious to the fact that he is a horrible bounty hunter, keeps screwing up Spike's captures.
The English dub is passable and the Japanese vocals are superb as usual, so you can't go wrong either way.
Where Neon Genesis may have been too serious, or Rurouni Kenshin wasn't serious enough, Bebop is just the right mix. It truly is like its live action counterparts: major characters, women and children die, people are superstitious, use drugs, have strange mannerisms, and stake their lives on their loyalties.
The series is also great in that...it ends. There are little or no loose ends; in fact the series ends on a moment low on effects, but high in drama and tragedy. Viewers are left to ponder only what they have seen from the past, not to speculate on the future. Those just getting on the Bebop bandwagon are real lucky--you didn't have to wait so many Bebop-less years until the movie came out.
This series is highly, highly recommended, for any viewer, regardless of your enthusiasm or lack thereof for anime. You get attached to characters, marvel at the action and fight scenes, with eye-candy animation to top it off. No anime collection is legitimate without it, and no film collection is complete with Bebop missing.
A very cool anime that is no doubt one of the masterpiece series' of modern anime. Ten stars if I could.",1055980800,,4683,4.877038895859473
1821778,5,B00007LLIV,"First of all I once told people that I hated anime... but Cowboy Bebop isn't anime, well, not really. It is worthy of a live action status if it wouldn't be so expensive to produce! Actual character development, of characters that one can truely believe in is one of the many things that set it apart.
And the music! Truely Yoko Kanno is one of the greatest musicians in the world, and without her beautiful musical contribution Cowboy Bebop just wouldn't be the same.
The sessions, or episodes for those not familiar with Cowboy Bebop, are written so that if watched out-of-order you can stil enjoy them and understand what is going on. Each one is a small short-story unto itself, yet also part of the whole... just like life.
Beautiful... worthy of 10 stars!",1055635200,3,761,4.644444444444445
1821779,5,B00007LLIV,"The other reviewers did an excellent job at outlining the premise of the story, so I won't delve into that.  As stated, each episode is pretty complete in itself, but you will get the most enjoyment by watching the series in its entirety as you get to see how the personalities evolve and how the individuals end up as partners in bounty hunting.
The appeal and accessibility of this series may be that it is the most western theme in an anime I have ever witnessed; the attitude and culture of the characters have a definite American flair to them.
Right off the bat, you will be blown away by the details in the artwork of this anime.  That's what the Japanese excel at - an exceptional eye for detail that I have always found to be lacking in Western animation.  Great story, great dialogue (voice characterization has the best emotional nuances I've ever heard in anime), quirky characters with depth and humour, plenty of energetic action, and oh what fabulous music accompaniment (never knew the Japanese could do Jazz as well as they do Salsa). This anime will be quite impossible to top and guaranteed to be cult classic.
Finally, notice the five Stars out of hundreds of ratings? Just Get It! You will not be dissapointed.
Note:  I don't enjoy Pokemon or Sailormoon or Digimon, etc...

1821783,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop has been, since it's release in 1998, the bar by which every new anime series is judged by. It's just that good. Many have described it as 1970's cop show-meets western-meets high-quality drama-meets film-noir, and I am gonna have to agree with them.
Cowboy Bebop revolves around futuristic bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, and the series is really just their exploits through the universe. Along the way, they meet female bounty hunter Faye Valentine, computer hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th (simply Ed for short), data dog Ein, and various bounties and figures from their past.
The beauty of Cowboy Bebop is that although the show does have a recurring story based around Spike's past, this is more or less tossed aside for ""filler"" episodes, or one episode storylines. Through filler episodes, we make a very strong bond and attachment to these characters, and it makes the ending to it all the more heartfelt.
When I watch Cowboy Bebop, I really do feel what happens to the characters. You feel sympathy and plight, happiness and joy, sadness and sorrow. You care about the characters, and I commend the staff who worked on the series for doing this. Very few anime series have characters for whom you can actually relate to, build bonds to emotionally, and frankly, give a damn about. Cowboy Bebop pulls it off with elegance and grace, as if it were nothing.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever created, hands down. it has excellent characters, wonderful storylines, beautiful animation, and mesmorizing locales. It remains to be one of my favorites of all time.",1053129600,11,1622,4.880434782608695

1821797,5,B00007LLIV,"I watched adault swim, after seeing funny showes like Home Movies, and the brak show, I saw a show called cowboy bebop.  I was like, ""Ohh what's this?""  The first episode I saw was ""Ballad of fallen angels""  It had me hooked, and I was interested, and the shootout rasid my excitement pretty high, and I was introduced to one of my favorite anime's ever.
The characters are definitly one of the greatest casts ever.
Spike:He's definitly one of the best hero's ever.  All he needs is a pistol, and his fighting technuiqes to bust bounty hunters up, altho most of their plans backfire.  He travels with Ject, Faye, Ed, and Ein, he can't stand the fact that trouble, hackers, and aimals are on the ship, and he always thinks, how the hell did all three of them get on a once peaceful ship?  He also has a pretty nice ship that he flys all the time when he needs to catch up with someone who has a bounty on his head.  And he has a violent past of being with the syndacate(te red dragon, a yakuza mafia) he hated the syndacate so much, he faked his death just to get out of it.  But he's nowhere near away from the syndacate, cause has a lot of run ins with them along his way, and eventually leads him to a final showdown with the syndacate.
Ject:Former police officer who joins spike shortly after Spike leaves the syndacate.  Ject is the pilot of the bebop, and man he has to fix, clean, and cook,(Jeez it must really stink that he has to cook too).  He also meets his past throughout the series(and you get to find out what happens to his arm.
Faye:You get to say hello to Faye in ""Honky Tonk Women"".  She is the laziest member of the crew(But she's pretty gosh darn sexy), and always want's money, and what does she do with it, throw it all away in a casino.  She definitly makes Spike and Ject very angry at times.  She has some moves that'll knock a enemy out of his shoes, and has a pretty nice ship as well.  But throughout all this she faces her past, as well, and we find what is up.
Ed:Ed hit's the sceene in ""Jamming with Edward""  She is very childish, and may seem a thorn in the teams side, but yet, when they need some hacking to be done, she's their best friend because, then she becomes a freaking genius.  Ed has one episode where she takes the floor and finally gets a taste of action, in ""mushroom somba"".  And later on like everyone else she, as well as faye, faces her past.
Ein:Ein was a stray dog worth BIG BUCKS, and he crashed the show in ""Stray Dog Strut"" I dunno what he does, but the dog is pretty smart.
Julia:The woman who once loved spike, and somewhat loves vicious.  Every time Spike hears her name, he just goes straight crazy, and starts looking for her.  She's somewhat mysterious in many ways, but when Spike finds her, and they plan to run away from the syndacat's wrath, but will they make it?
Vicious:One of my favorite villian's of all time(Alongside Sessomeru(Inuyasha),Knives(Trigun), and Sephroth(Final Fantasy VII).  Vicous has alot in common with these three, he has a cold, and dark heart, he evil, cruel, ruthless, and his name describes him well enough.  He is a member of the syndacate, and is undeniebly Spike's worst enemy.  They were once on the same side, but now there just two men on opposite sides, and Vicious want's Spike dead.  I really don't know what his motive is, most likeley the love over Julia, or his loyalty for the syndacate. who knows? But one day it will all be over.
I also love many episodes as well, especially these
Astroid blues:It got off to a real hot start.  Bloody eye, whatever it's called looks pretty cool, and it's Spike and Jects first bounty, a Bloody eye addict
Balled of fallen angels:The first episode I saw.  What seems like another bounty, leeds Spike into a deadly match with his past.
Sympathy for the devil:A normal kid, is very mysterious, and, for some reason, Spike's gonna need more than bullets to stop him
Toys in the attic:A pretty freaky episode.  A wierd thing affects the whole crew, and then Spike rembers something about the attic of the ship
Jupiter Jazz:Spike says hello to vicious once again, and says hello to a man, who has a very wirerd secret.
Mushroom Somba:Ed gets her time to shine.  She meets a mushroom dealer, who has trouble with a another man who lost his brother cause of his mushrooms.
Pierrot Le Fou:Gotta love the animation here.  Spike gets info on a man with a nice bounty that smiles at his enemys and that's the last thing they see.
The real folk blues:The final chapter of the whole series.  Spike meets his love Julia, but yet the sydacate is not far behind.
As to this day I'm watchin the show on adult swim, as well as Trigun, and Inuyasha.  I love this show, ad if you love anime, you shouldn't miss this.  And man this is a long review, and for those who read it, thank you, and I hope it was helpful.
Last words:This series will not only make you remember the wild rollercoaster it took you on, but also how bitterly sweet and sad it ended

Bebop stars the crew of the (guess what) Bebop.  The crew starts out with Jet and Spike, but soon includes Edd and Faye.  Faye and Edd come along as the anime progresses.  It is also real interesting cause if you miss one episode you really didn't miss nothing.  This is because every episode is different bounties and stuff.

I am delighted by the depth of the characters, the animation, the action, the humor, and of course, last but not least, the music.
Bebop draws you in and you care about these characters. The details and work that went into make these sessions transform them from a simple, animated episodes to a slices of life, and humanity.
From the opening blast of ""Tank!"" to the sweeping finality of ""Blue,"" one of the best songs I have ever heard come out of an animated series, or anywhere, the Bebop and its crew draw you in and won't let go.

If you are one of those late night freaks who loves to stay tuned to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, then Cowboy Bebop is a must on your animation radar.  The problem that I have found with watching Cowboy Bebop on late night cable television, is that it is just a hair past my bedtime and I am continually missing sessions.  This complete Session Bow Set is the perfect answer.
Following the trials and tribulations of Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, two bounty hunters both with mysterious pasts.  In future sessions you are introduced to the seductive and boisterious Faye Valentine and the flighty hacker prodigy, Edward.  The chemistry between these four souls and the characters they meet on their way put Cowboy Bebop on a level all by itself.  All 24 sessions are connected in some way, whether it be recurring characters, continued themes or repeated lines.

1821806,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is only ""anime"" in the sense that it's animated and it came out of Japan.  Much like the film AKIRA (one of the few anime films I like), it's hard-edged sci-fi that goes for gritty realism.  It IS NOT ANIME in the typical sense--it lacks everything that I hate about anime, and that is why I love the Bebop!
The characters are very human, and very engaging.  Spike Spiegel, the main protagonist, is a great everyman character, and his partners, Jet and Faye, both wear their roles well.  Even Ed--the most ""anime"" thing about this series--fits into the storyline, and has many moments of genuine humanity.  Best of all is Ein, though--the most realistic dog ever animated, and source of the of the best laughs in the series.
All of the episodes are not pitch-perfect.  Like any worthwhile series, there are great episodes, good episodes and a few mediocre episodes (though not one truly *bad* episode).  But you'll forgive them the hollow moments, for even when one element of an episode isn't working, there's something else (like the music) that most definitely *is*.

1821807,5,B00007LLIV,"To be honest cowboy bebop is the best anime I've seen to date period.  It's just a piece of art in my humble opinion.  The only fault is it's semi-linear stlye which isn't a bad thing because in a way it makes every episode seem fresh.  So why would I have a problem with that. Only because the more linear episodes are incredible and if they really wanted to add the depth they could make you feel something for any character they put on the screen.
But don't get me wrong there's no lack of depth in this series in one episode (3) I realize the main character spike flips his cig between his fingers that would seem stupid any other time but I was doing just that at the same time.  My point in this story there is no heros alot of people get shot some live some don't.  Each character has a vice and characteristics that make them more than what they are.  It's as if each of them is pieces of people that do exist and it's done perfect.
At the end of the series all the pieces fall into place and everything comes full circle.  which doesn't help the fact that you want more of it but there does seem to be some balance.  In short it's something very special buy it.",1049155200,,1170,4.146017699115045
1821808,5,B00007LLIV,"The Cowboy Bebop series is very nearly as great a success as Evangelion, and far better than the run-of-the-mill anime production.  Using the simply idea of a group of picaresque social rejects who support themselves as bounty hunters in 2071 AD.  Jet is an ex-cop who could not deal with the corruption, Spike is a Yakuza escapee with a hidden tragedy in his past, Faye is a beautiful and amoral gambler with an identity crisis, and Ed is a 13-year-old computer crazy who is never far from an input device.  Oh!  Someone will kill me if I fail to mention Ein the mysterious data dog.
For the most part this crew careens about space with no visible means of support, always doing the right thing at the wrong time.  Managing to not quite get the results they planned.  Yet each individual has their own story, their own karma to work out.  And they do.  Before the long show is over you will find yourself laughing and crying at the same time, desperately hoping that director Shinichiro Watanabe sees his way to create a sequel.
Production quality is superb.  Illustration and animation capture the details of the future, the minutia of the varieties of human expression, and the grace of comic pratfalls.  Yoko Kanno, who has left a trail of brilliant scores, creates all the jazzy theme music.  I have reviewed the individual DVDs, so I won't repeat myself here, but this is definitely a ""cannot have just one"" series.  This set offers considerable savings over the cost of the six individual DVDs - and you will want them all.

1821809,5,B00007LLIV,"Argueably the BEST anime series ever to grace human eyes, Cowboy Bebop has it all. I was reluctant to watch it at first as the intro looked like it was an old 80's anime...I was so wrong. Cowboy bebop is just an extremely well balanced series of 26 episodes (a standard length for anime series).
The animation is just so fluid and realistic and the characters are just so well characterized that you can't help but not consider them real people somewhere out there in the world, hiding from us. Their movements are nothing short than accurate and you can tell that the artists have studied the human movements. The animation is true artwork...a masterpiece that moves before us. The smallest things are detailed and as an artist, I appreticate all these small details nonartists don't bother to look at. The attention to detail is remarkably placed through out the series as well as the movie, ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"", which in the begining has incredable detial on the store window with adertisments. No other anime I have seen compares quite to Cowboy Bebop. You DragonBall Z lovers know nothing of true anime, DBZ is barely classified as anime in fact. DBZ artwork vs Cowboy Bebop artwork is laughable at best as if comparing Michelangelo's work to the pop art of today. The shadows are great in Cowboy Bebop, especially in episode 20, Pierrot Le Foul.
The music is a soundtrack of beautiful melodies, mostly jazz, bebop, or blues. Much of the best music is seen in episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angles. But music is through out the series and is very nice. The mood and tone is sharpened by the great music scores by Yoko Kanno and Mia Yamane. Sound effects are also great in the series and nothing small goes unnoticed without realistic sound effects. The translation of Japanese to English is the best translation I have ever seen, and trust me, dubbing and translations can get bad.
The story is....the story is really good. Talk about every kid's wish for a great story. It would make those DBZ fans weep. The villian or antagonist is more bad azz than all the villians in DBZ combined (not to gang up on DBZ but DBZ is widely popular and known). Who needs Frieza the feminent loser or Buu the pink blob when you have Vicious, Cowboy Bebop's main villian. Spike is the main character who has unmatched skill in fighting, yet Vicious always appears to be almost equal. Spike is a gun slinging type guy while Vicious is ol' skool and uses a samurai sword. It's a very nice mix of old and new, past and future. The fights with the sword and gun are truely original and eye boogling the way they use their weapons. This is especially seen in episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angles and episode 26, The Real Folks Blues Part Two. The scene where Spike falls to the floor and has his gun pressed onto Vicious's body while Vicious has his sword arked on Spike's body...in a standstill. I can't say anymore of what happens except that it ends with a big bang and some very emotional scenes with a superb tone. The other characters in this series include Faye: The sexy tomboy who uses guns and brut force to catch her bounties...she's like a downgraded Spike with less skill. Next is jet, the owner of the ship they fly in and also the one who has a lot of knowledge of what they do. Ed is a super intelligent girl often mistaken for a boy and she is a hacker. Ein is the dog who was a test subject which made him intelligent. That's the whole crew.
If you were to only watch a couple of episodes to test it I would definately reccomend episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angles (for the coolness of it all), episode 20, Pierrot Le Fou (for great aninimation and fighting), and episode 11, Toys in the Attic (For great humor). The strangest thing is that lots of the episodes have terrific replay value, I can watch an episode more than twnety times and still love every little detail, and I'm no anime freak, just the average guy who like good things too watch. Amazing considering watching something so many times will cause a decline if attention.
Other anime I recommend:
Inuyasha
Samurai X",1048377600,8,4084,4.542740841248304
1821810,5,B00007LLIV,"First of all, let me start by saying that Cowboy BeBop is my favorite anime, and loved by many others!  I'm sorry, I just felt like I had to say that. ;)  On with the review!
  Summary
  Aboard the old fishing ship, The BeBop, live bounty hunters Spike Spiegal and Jet Black.  Money doesn't come very easily to them, and they usually don't get the bounty that they're after.  They make a good team, but both are very stubborn which leads to problems sometimes.  If that's not bad enough, how about adding an illegal ""data dog"" named Ein, a woman with massive debts and always seems to attract trouble named Faye Valentine, and a genius teenage hacker named Edward Wong Hau Pepilu Tivursky 4th to the team?  Things just got rougher for the crew of the BeBop...
  Characters
Spike Spiegal
He was a former member of the Red Dragon syndicate, who's past is clouded.  He doesn't share his feelings with anyone.  The only thing Jet and the others know is that he he has a strange relationship with a man named Vicious, and a woman named Julia...
Jet Black
Former ISSP (police) officer, Jet Black is the owner of the BeBop.  While it is a mystery on how Jet and Spike met, he seems to be the only person that Spike truly trusts.  Jet doesn't always like to talk about his past either, but he doesnt' keep it in as much as Spike does.  He doesn't like to talk about his mysterious injury regarding his arm, though.
Faye Valentine
Little about her is known, but she claims to be a gypsie when she and Spike meet.  There are only 3 things that they are sure of.  She loves to gamble, she has a huge debt to pay off, and she's nothing but trouble.
Edward Wong Hau Pepilu Tivurksy 4th
Edward Wo...Let's just call her (yes, HER!) Ed.  Ed's a teenage hacker from Earth that the BeBop crew happen to come across.  Despite her age (13), she's a very skilled hacker.  Everyone on Earth knows her name!  This is all that is known about her.
Ein
A Welsh Corgi ""data dog"" that that Spike and Jet run into while chasing their bounty.  So what is a ""data dog""?  Well, it's a-
  Animation
The animation is very high-quality!  You can tell that the producers spent a lot of money making it.  It's very fluid, and breathe a bit of life into the characters.  The first episode is done better than the second and third one.  From the fourth one on is done like the first one.  In other words, episodes 1, and 4-26 are done better than episodes 2 and 3.  This may seem strange that the first episode is done better than the second and third, but the first episode was made AFTER the 13th episode.  It wasn't created untill the 13th (I think) was made.  Cowboy BeBop was intended as a 13-episode series.  When it got a spot on a new network however, they decided to make it longer with a new first episode.  Did you get all that?
  Music
  WOW!  Yoko Kanno, Cowboy BeBop's composer, has outdone herself!  The music is breathtaking and memorable!  When you're watching the series and one of her songs come up, you can't help but realize that it's much more than just mere backround music.  This isn't typical anime music.  There's a lot of jazz, some ska, a heavy metal song, and, well... You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it!  There are currently 8 CD soundtracks to it right now, and I highly recomend getting them if you've seen the series.
  All in all, Cowboy BeBop is one of the best anime's around.  If you missed out on the box set, this is perfect for you.  I'm highly anticipating the release of the movie, which comes out soon!  Cowboy BeBop will become, if it already isn't, an instant classic that people will be talking about for a long time!  Are you still reading my review?  Hurry up and buy this set!",1048291200,,3702,4.366176470588235
1821811,4,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is one of the most imaginative anime series I have seen in recent years. It is a hybrid of many different styles of animation and the settings themselves are a rich mix of cultures..
Definitely aimed at the adults, this is a series that doesn't insult your intelligence. There are some episodes I wasn't real impressed with towards the start of the series while others are raw and gritty (anything involving the Syndicate) and others are flat out hilarious (the mystery food in the fridge episode)..
The thing that really bothered me about this series is that just as it seemed to be hitting its stride, it ends.. Sure, things are wrapped up to some extent; but it had the same '... we're cancelled' compressed-ending feeling that Outlaw Star had.
Good series but buy the imports from one of Amazon's used and new stores..",1047686400,,835,4.726027397260274
1821812,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is probably the best anime series of this decade (and the last one), and one of the best series that Americans will ever be able to watch.  (dont you dare forget  old school Robotech...)  Bebop is a wonderful series with an incredible plot (every episode is a different <playing> ""session""), intriguing characters, and the music....'bebop' is an understatement. more like sheer genius.  So amazing, that you should also purchase the soundtracks--that's how good the episodes are.
  Set in a lawless free-for-all future, Bebop lets us in on the 'sessions' of 5 main characters: an ex-cop and his welsh corgi dog, a mysterious young man who claims to have already died, a young woman with luck on her side, and a young, computer-hacking genius.  You'll laugh and cry with these endearing, frighteningly real characters exploring real relationships in real situations...and you'll understand that this is more than a cartoon. It's an experience.
  Exploring different themes and styles, the musicians, artists, and writers on this show create an entertaining, aesthetically-pleasing, mind-blowing series of action-packed jam 'sessions' that everyone should own 2 copies of.",1046304000,14,1183,5.420765027322404
1821813,5,B00007LLIV,"While flipping through channels at midnight, I accidently discovered Cowboy Bebop.  Instantly, it grabbed my attention, for good.
This is how anime should be made.  Strong set of core characters, involving story, and having fun watching it.  This one has it all.
For long time, anime has not been main attraction because of its quirkiness.  Most of them are too strong on cultural cliche, too much sci-fi, gory, or just about everything else.  This one, took different approach which is to create anime without barriers for viewers to enjoy, and results are mind-blowing.
The music, strong sets of Jazz, and bluegrass, are very pleasing and fitting to the series which projects the image of futuristic cowboys.  With bits of silliness, and some serious tones, this couldn't get any better.
The drawing, it is clean, well excuted, with bit of extra abilities which only animes can give (just watch the fight scene).  The characters are very attractive, and have personalities projecting instead of being absorbed by surroundings.
The story, properly done.  I don't want to spoil it.  Even filler episodes are so fun to watch, you forget about the main story (or maybe you don't want to remind about that the show has to end).
I could go on and on, but this should sum up.  This is my 2nd best choice for anime.  If you are beginner, this series should be the starting point.  Then you may move on to something more serious.",1046131200,,1422,4.806584362139918
1821824,5,B00007LLIV,"Let me make a perfectly clear point that one reviewer falsely complained of: There IS a plot.  In fact, there are two. The first is on discs 1-4, a 16 part adventure which will[pull]you in.  It ends abruptly, though; but fans demanded more.  I give you discs 5 & 6, another 9 parts with a MORE complex and entertaining story that should be required viewing for high schoolers in creative writing classes.  It is a truely moving and inspiring piece of work.",1045785600,,456,4.524390243902439
1821825,3,B00007LLIV,"Ok, I'm going to keep this review brief and straight to the point.  I've seen about the first 6 episodes so far and I've come to the conclusion that their is no plot.  Maybe there is and I'm too impatient to wait for it, but seriously, who makes you wait through 6 episodes without a hint of a plot?  You could seriously pop in any episode out of order and you'd understand everything going on.  Sure it has great CG effects and nice animation.  The fight scenes are ok, but come on, without a plot I feel naked.  If you want a shoot'em up show go ahead.  If you like something meaningful, try Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1821826,5,B00007LLIV,"I have watched a lot of movies, and own a LOT of anime (close to about 100 DVD's in anime alone) and none of them have been watched as many times as my Bebop set.  This series has it all...guns, chicks, humor, space fights, dog chases, prairie oysters(lol), rivaling syndicates.....you name it, its in Bebop at some point in time.
Now onto the story.  There are many different themes, but mainly the story consists of a lot of short stories that revolve around the band of bounty hunters earning a living.  The crew of the Bebop starts off with Spike and Jet.  I don't want to give too much away, but Jet is the older of the two but by no means is he a slouch and he is also the captain of the Bebop...where as Spike is the karate kickin, pistol fightin, brute force always wins kind of guy.  They meet some other interesting comrades that join up along the way as well.
All in all this series is great.  It is absolutely hilarious at times but can also be quite serious and sad.  If you're not willing to spend all the money on the set right off, I would suggest picking up Best Sessions and checking that out.  Only thing I don't like about Best Sessions is that those are the only episodes in 5.1 surround sound =)  Be warned though, once you watch Best Sessions, you WILL want the set, and it is well worth it.  Like I said earlier, I have watched this countless times again and again.  I watch anime every night while playing video games on my pc, and last week it was nothing but Cowboy Bebop.  Also there is a feature film out as well that takes place between episodes 22 and 23 its called Knocking on Heavens Door.  You can only find it subbed for now as it has not been released in the US yet, but it is still a FANTASTIC watch.  If you like some of the fight scenes produced in the TV series, you will love them in Knocking on Heaves door.  One more thing...watch it in English.  Yes that's right, most people never watch anime in English because they think it's horrible.  Personally I watch all my anime in English, but I have heard from others that bebop should be watched in English and I couldn't agree more.  They used the same Japanese actors in the movie Knocking on Heavens door as they did in the series, and while it was good, the English actors sound SO much better.
Also, another warning, the music will hook you!  The jazzy tunes and upbeat songs through the fight scenes fit so well as do the slower tunes during the more dramatic scenes.  After listening to all the music, my favorites tunes happen to be 'Rush' which is played during the fight scene between Asomoth (think I spelled that right) and Spike, and 'Call me Call me' played later in the series.  I personally own a lot of anime sound tracks as well, and while I love em all, the ones I have for Cowboy Bebop (all of em) rule!  They have not left the CD player in my truck for the last month.
If you enjoyed Bebop, you may also want to look at Trigun as well, or vice versa, as Vash (from Trigun) and Spike (from Bebop) have many similarities.
Well I know my review is a little jumbled, but I don't care, I made my point, and you really should get this series, you will not regret it.  So with that I say farwell........See you Space Cowboy.
BANG!",1045008000,5,3234,4.2655737704918035
1821827,5,B00007LLIV,"One of the most fabulus Anime series out there. CBB is one of the few series that mixes humor/action-adventure/romance and a whole bunch more. With characters like Spike,Jet,and Faye you will never be disapointed with entertainment. Not to mention the grat music and dubing along with some terific background effects. This set however isn't ment for kids. There is a lot of blood in it and shooting scenes.",1044835200,,406,4.985294117647059
1821828,5,B00007LLIV,"This is a series that rivals with Neon Genesis Evangelion as best series of all time. The animation is superb, the acting flawless, the story is written with great skill and care, and it has the most satisfying ending ever. The ending is better than any movie or book I've ever seen. This is one series you can watch over and over again and not get tired of.
There is one small problem with this series. The last two episodes should have been edited into a 2-hour movie. That would have been the greatest movie ever.
Out of all of the characters I think that Ed is the best. She is always great comic relief for such a bleak and disturbing show. Spike also is a very cool character. The reason why he goes to Vicious in the last episode is explained in the movie, which takes place between episodes 22 and 23.
Stop reading and just watch it already. Don't watch the edited version on Cartoon Network. Get the completely uncut DVDs and watch them subtitled (though for once the dubbed version is good). And even if you're in the mood for something where the good guys suffer it's a show for you.
My personal favorites are sessions 26, 25, 11, 5, 20, and the movie. And it only takes you 649 minutes to watch the whole series!
WARNING!: The folks at Pioneer think this is for ages 13 and up. They are very wrong. No one under 15 should view the series because of it's violence.

1821829,5,B00007LLIV,"Cowboy Bebop is a series that should need no introduction to anime fans. However, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it's basically about space bounty hunters set to an old time jazz music soundtrack with plenty of classy old time stories and dark morals along the way. If you like action, space, jazz, or comedy, you may like Cowboy Bebop. If you like old time bounty hunter, private eye, or detective movies, you'll probably like Cowboy Bebop. If you like dark stories with twists that really make you feel for the characters, you'll like Cowboy Bebop. This is one series you don't have to be an anime fan to appreciate, but you have to be willing to give it a fair chance.
A single episode of Cowboy Bebop packs more punch than several entire anime series I know of. If you're not a fan of the show by the end of episode one alone, you probably won't be. The characters are as real as any old time bounty hunter / detective movie, and every bit as interesting. The sci-fi space twist doesn't take away from the show in the slightest, it adds much. A good way of thinking about the show is Lupin the 3rd mixed with Outlaw Star, with more depth. With episode titles like Asteroid Blues, Honky Tonk Woman, Waltz for Venus, and Jupiter Jazz, the space, class, and jazz heavy style is quite apparent from the beginning. This isn't just some theme slapped on top of an anime, rather a critical part of the show.
The characters are well rounded and all very interesting. Unlike a lot of anime, there is no annoying character you wish they would have left out. Each character is given equal importance, though the show centers on the bounty hunter Spike.
Spike describes himself as an ""old fashioned cowboy."" He spends a lot of the series searching for someone he once knew, I'll avoid details so I don't spoil anything. He could be a master thief if he so choose, his dexterity and fighting skills are nearly unmatched. With a good 'whatever' attitude, he's great fun to watch.
Jet is more of an old time detective. He's the owner of the ship ""Bebop"", and best friend of Spike. He does his fair share in bounty hunting like Spike, mostly gathering information and providing backup to Spike.
Faye is pretty much the anime embodiment of the women from detective movies. A fiercely materialistic woman, she does whatever it takes to get what she wants. She's not against stealing from anyone or using anyone to get it, then leaving them cold. An incredible bounty hunter in her own right, she joins the team without invitation or welcome. Much hilarious bickering and bounty thefts come between Faye and Spike from the outset.
Ed is a hacker genius girl who joins the group after a promise from Faye to get information. They try to leave her dry after they get what they need... but Ed's hacking skills make that impossible. She's often comic relief, and may be insane. Who can tell? In any case, when hacking or computer skills are needed, Ed is there. When not needed, she's... still there, being a hilarious pain in the neck. She's often with Ein, a seemingly ordinary mutt that gets picked up along the way with a few not so hidden talents.
In any case, Cowboy Bebop is a series anyone should watch. It has some language, a lot of violence, and some dark stories, but nothing that any kid these days hasn't seen a hundred times over. Even if you're not a bounty hunter or jazz fan, give this series a shot. Don't be surprised if you start to take a liking to jazz music or Yoko Kanno's amazing music.

1821830,5,B00007LLIV,"Since many others more competent than I have provided reviews pertaining to the content of Cowboy Bebop I will just add it is definitely one of the best.
What I would like to provide is a clarification on the product being offered and its quality due to some reviews here making negative comments.
Yesterday I received the ""Cowboy Bebop Box Set (Volumes 1-6) (Amazon.com Exclusive)"" and can attest to the fact that although the set is not ""boxed"" (unless you count the shipping box) it does include six (6) individual DVDs each in what appears to be an original case.
The first two DVDs (Sessions 1 & 2) each contain 5 Cowboy Bebop sessions. The remaining 4 DVDs (Sessions 3 - 6) contain 4 sessions each.
A random sampling of DVDs/Sessions shows both the picture and audio quality to be superb. It appears to me as though Amazon.com has simply assembled the individual Cowboy Bebop Session 1 through 6 DVDs and is offering them at a bargain price.
To sum up this set is definitely not of inferior quality or a Chinese bootleg as some reviewers have suggested, it contains 6 individually packaged DVDs, and the lowest price I was able to find elsewhere for each DVD was approx. $...each.
You do the math!
