8078976,5,B00008YLTA,"I've rented this video several times from the video store because it helps me improve my balance and riding.

It helps to first read the book ""Centered Riding"" by Sally Swift as this will clue you into the visual imagery that she uses to get riders to stretch and relax.

Sally instructs various riders, coaching and encouraging them to be centered.  It is for all kinds of riders - beginners especially.  It helps the frightened or nervous rider relax.

This is a video you can play over and over again and see something different each time.",1093305600,13,542,4.604166666666667
