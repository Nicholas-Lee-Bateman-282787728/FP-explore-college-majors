7344453,3,B0128P22QY,"Love Duck Dynasty!  Disappointed that A&E put out season 8 dvd set WITHOUT the season finale episode.  Why?  That's why I gave a lower rating.  If you're buying a 'season', you expect all the aired episodes for that season.",1444262400,17,223,4.641025641025641
7344454,2,B0128P22QY,"I love this series, but be aware that the season 8 DVD set (two discs) that I received on 2015-10-06 only has episodes 1-8 of season 8 and does *NOT* include the one-hour episode 9 season finale named ""John Luke Gets Hitched"" which aired on 2015-08-19. I'm not sure why, but hopefully someone can explain this.

**UPDATE 2015-11-05** - Well, it seems that A&E is going to release the wedding as a separate 86 minute DVD in early 2016. This kind of double-dipping is annoying, but consumers keep buying when this happens so it's no wonder the producers keep doing it. Meh.",1444176000,26,571,4.598039215686274
