8099041,5,B000CGYOKE,This DVD is filled with lots of tips from a former pro player and I thought it was well worth the price. Highly recommend as the best hockey DVD we have purchased so far. Kudos to Jim Dowd for putting together a practical guide to take young players to the next level.,1439424000,,268,4.173076923076923
8099042,4,B000CGYOKE,"In this video, Jim Dowd again proves the old adage that role players make better teachers than stars.  Here's a guy who's played a decade and a half in the NHL who's on the ice with 6 or 7 youngsters and providing more valuable instruction than the kids would get at any camp.  For a pro athlete, Dowd's as down-to-earth as they come, and it's clear the kids in the video respond to that.",1153094400,,388,4.22972972972973
