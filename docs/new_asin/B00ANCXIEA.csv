8554609,5,B00ANCXIEA,"in Dye, Cut, Knit, Brecia Kralovic-Logan shows us how to play, explore and discover the secrets of creating a beautiful fabric from silk strips.  She takes the mystery out of dyeing the silk and gives us the tools to make our own palette.  After watching the video I was able to create fabric with my own original personal stamp on it.  Brecia gives a great discussion about materials to use including the different silks to choose from, an easy dye method, ways of cutting the silk into strips, joining the strips, and knitting the fabric.  I would highly recommend this workshop to any fiber artist!",1365379200,,601,4.695238095238095
8554610,5,B00ANCXIEA,"Once again Brecia Kralovic-Logan offers a workshop that inspires creativity and gives viewers all the instruction they need to make beautiful wearable pieces. Ms. Kralovic-Logan shares how to create your own knitting materials simply, by dyeing and tearing silk. The methods are well explained and clear, and the chapter feature on the DVD makes it simple to repeat sections or skip if the viewer is familiar with the technique already. The materials are clearly listed and the purpose and use for each is clearly explained. Ms. Kralovic-Logan does an excellent job of balancing direction with options about how to personalize the project and she inspires viewers to get creative. The projects call for very basic knitting skills, but she does not teach the most basic stitch, but there are lots of resources online that can teach that. A good investment if you are interested in trying new processes and want to explore new creative outlets.",1362096000,,942,5.083870967741936
