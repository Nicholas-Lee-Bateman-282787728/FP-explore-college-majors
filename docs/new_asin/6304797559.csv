Haven't seen 4-6 or the DVD's so I couldn't tell ya how they compare. As somebody else already said, you have to sort through some stupid ones, but there are enough funnies to keep ya laughing.... FF through Furniture Phillangies... the worste cartoon of em all.....",996019200,2,397,4.4520547945205475
8588100,4,6304797559,"Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted lives up to it's reputation as always. It's important to know that this is not a collection of the best shorts ever made; it's one of many Sick and Twisted festivals (so not every short  is going to have you falling out of your seat laughing).  Just remember:  If you would rather watch South Park, Beavis and Butthead or Bill Plympton,  Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted is where those cartoons premiered.  Sometimes you have to sift through mud to find a diamond in the rough.",929059200,,510,4.5
8588101,3,6304797559,"Are you demented?  Do you have a sick sense of humor?  If so, you would probably really enjoy this collection of animated shorts.  I had actually attended one of the Sick and Twisted animation festivals about a year ago, and I personally enjoyed the (way) off-the-wall cartoons.  However, if you are thinking of purchasing this for younger viewers, think again.  With such shorts as ""Horndog"" and ""How to Make Love to a Woman"" or even better, ""Rick the Dick"", you're looking at some very mature content that should really only be viewed by people old enough to not let the language bother them, but young enough to still appreciate jokes about flatulence and explicite animated sex (like me!).  Oh yes, and do be aware of the fact that there is full-frontal nudity of both men and women characters on this DVD.  Okay, that's about it.  END",901843200,2,839,4.698630136986301
