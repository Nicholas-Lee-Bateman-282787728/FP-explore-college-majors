8507799,4,B0070LXU4A,"An anthology of 2 ghost stories hailing from Hong Kong. My only complaint is the use of the ""over-the-top"" CGI, made the ghosts look more laughable than scary. I love anthologies and this didn't disappoint. With only 2 stories you get a good length on each story making this DVD an hour and a half long.",1421020800,,303,4.428571428571429
