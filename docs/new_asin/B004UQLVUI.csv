8442000,1,B004UQLVUI,looks like a bootleg,1525219200,,20,4.25
8442001,4,B004UQLVUI,Well acted. Good mix of characters. Irrfan Khan perfect as the slighly quirky suitor. His horseride one of the funniest things I've ever seen. He and Konkona Sen Sharma have been together in many movies. Their chemistry is wonderful. It was interesting to see the homage to Brief Encounter with Shilpa Shetty and Kay Kay Menon. I have only seen him in a few roles but they were all unsavory characters. I'm hoping to see him as the good guy.,1472774400,,441,4.525

8442004,5,B004UQLVUI,I saw this movie a few years ago and I still love it today! I know that you will enjoy this movie!,1365811200,,98,3.5
8442005,3,B004UQLVUI,"Negative:
- the 2007 movie gets more mushy and unrealistic with every quarter of an hour, the actors drone on about love etc., there is death, near death and too much of an ambulance
- background music is too sweet as well
- occasionally you see three unshaved bards singing the songs that otherwise form the background for the movie (among the bards is musical director Pritam); these obsolete figures play non-connected e-guitars in the rain
- too many unhappy relationsships and cheating; and oh yes, too much rain
- obnoxius plugs for Lenovo
- Shilpa Shetty plays to corny and over-fragile; Sharman Joshi is too soft and sweet as well
- it's too easy to see where all the different relations will go to
- the drastic comedic action at the movie's end doesn't go down well the rest of the film

What i liked though:
- some good acting, especially Irrfan Khan as a bizarre office worker and K.K. Menon as a cynic
- the various sub-plots are nicely interwoven, it's not too confusing
- nice to see good old Dharmendra again

Some parallels:
: an ensemble movie with voices audibly recorded later in a sound studio, droning on about Love etc., that feels like the horrible Salam-e Ishq
: a planned adultery with the active lady shedding pre-emptive tears sounds like Khabi Alvida Na Khena (2006) with Rani Mukherjee in the same situation
: musician entering the scene but not connected to the story, director Anurag Basu repeated that idea in his second-next movie Barfi! Both Barfi! and Life in a Metro also have too much of a too sweet background score
: Basu obviously took ideas from many other movies, there are revealing comparisons online
: the luxury apartment with the sleeping-room view over Mumbai appears in at least one other Bollywood movie, i believe in Laage Chunari Mein Daag (2007) as Rani Mukherjee's apartment; or am i wrong?",1361923200,,1845,4.708978328173375
8442006,4,B004UQLVUI,"This is a good blend of lives of different kinds of people staying in a metro and the conditions and situations they come across. The story is interwoven with different characters related to each other and takes care of all kinds of people not to miss any kind of character that is found in a metro. It is sensitive at times but entertaining. The plot is so nicely woven that you would be in touch with each and every character. The songs are also good and situational. Finally the end being really very crucial and the situations that come up treat everybody in a very practical way to manage everything and you won't feel it unrealistic because the directors and the script writers have done their job....

In short, once watchable, worth spending few hours for entertainment. I hope everybody enjoys......",1304467200,,808,4.7304964539007095
