After these low rent thrillers come out, certain manufactures duplicate them using the extended play mode to save some money, so you pick a copy up in the $2.99 bargain bin or buy it online from Amazon or eBay and when you get it home you can't play the darn thing because your VCR can't track it. You notice not one vendor ever mentions the fact the movie was captured in the crappy EP mode, otherwise nobody would buy the thing. I say this is an example of a lie by omission. Then I went out and ordered a third copy hoping it was transferred in the superior standard play mode. It was, thankfully, and I popped it in and it wouldn't track for a couple of minutes but it finally locked on and I found the image far superior to the other tapes. Unfortunately, half way through the movie the audio went downhill and started to exhibit an assortment of crackles, hisses, and pops. Keep in mind, this tape was not played on a piece of crap Emerson, rather I tried it on two high end Sonys, a high end JVC, and a high end 6-head Toshiba.
As to the movie itself, it's a pretty good example of the genre. You know, criminal type kills pregnant mother in front of a dozen people in broad daylight, admits to killing her and a cop,  as well, but during the trial the killer gets off on a technicality (the judge apologizes ). The outraged husband of the dead woman learns how to use an assortment of firearms and exacts his revenge. We've seen a hundred of them, right? This one is a little different, though. Joe Dellasandro is the murderous creep, and he is quite menacing here. Theresa Saldana plays of Joe's brother's suffering girlfriend , and it's always nice to see her (she should have become a major star). So, if you every find a good copy, let me know. In the meantime I have a special going on - buy two copies of the movie and get one free, no, make that buy one copy of the movie and get two free, no, what the heck, take them all for free, you can't watch or listen to them anyway (the slipcases look good, though)!",1399420800,2,2043,4.265463917525773
7815294,5,6301706390,"I enjoyed watching the actor LEIGH MCCLOSKEY in this movie about two men wanting to avenge the loss of their loved ones during a bank robbery shoot out.  Without evidence to convict the robber JOE HALSEY, he is released and sets out on his mission to make MICK TAYLOR play for getting his brother killed by the police.  Meanwhile, MICK TAYLOR begins to practice his gun shooting skills with the help from his father-in-law in order to protect himself and avenge the murder of his wife.  Maenwhile, a deputy named BURT persuades the woman (and childhood friend)ANGIE CORELLO to come to the police to help them convict JOE HALSEY and to get him out of her house.  Overall, this movie is a must have for all action lovers.  I got this for Christmas 2012 and glad of it.  I loved this since I first saw it in 1992, the year I was graduating from high school.  This and god knows how many other movies should be released on DVD.  Another movie that I would like released on DVD is MY MOTHER'S SECRET LIFE, which I first saw the same year as DOUBLE REVENGE, with AMANDA WYSS & LONI ANDERSON.",1356566400,,1085,4.417085427135678
7815295,5,6301706390,"Not the best movie out there...but not the worst either.  The acting holds your attention and the plot is rather good.  I gave it a 5 star because of the actor...Joe D.  However, the other actors do a good job also.",1344038400,,215,4.195121951219512
7815296,1,6301706390,"This action picture directed by Armand Mastroianni has a reactionary message, which caters to the right to bear arms lobby. During the escape from a bank holdup Joe Dallesandro loses his accomplice robber brother, and Leigh McCloskey, as a bystander, his pregant wife. However in these days of slippery lawyers and even slippier laws, Dallesandro gets off, since the stockinged mask the bandits wore does not allow for a postive witness identification. Since Dallesandro holds McCloskey to blame for the death of his brother, via enabling him to become a police target, and McCloskey blames Dallesandro for the death of his wife, the stage is set for the titular battle. Mastroianni has little of quality to work with here, with a screenplay that is the standard of ""They grow up so fast. One day I left home and she was in diapers, and when I came home she was in her wedding dress"", and concerning newspaper gossip ""If somebody writes it, somebody reads it"".  However he does manage to slip in a few nice touches, like the repeated use of the America song - campingly played on a jukebox in a climactic shootout, Dallesandro stubbing out his cigarette in food to show how tough he is, a montage of quick cuts of ""No"" testimony from the witnesses in the trial, and the opposing parties allow for parallels and cross-cutting. He also alludes to the western in his staging of some scenes - a bar has swinging doors and screens a John Wayne title on TV - and there is an aerial view of the two men approaching each other before the face-off. Although the only actor who gives a reasonable performance is Richard Rust as the put upon County Sheriff, Dallesandro provides the hunk appeal. Still a handsome man all these years after his legendary nude appearances for Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey, he's certainly the sexier of the two men in their matching tight jeans. Dallesandro's gay epithet to McCloskey at the trial gets the required response, even if McCloskey appears to lack the imagination for it, and Mastroianni's tongue is in full cheek when he has Dallesandro buy a child an ice cream cone.",989625600,5,2101,4.740437158469946
