4482692,5,B004VJJFZM,"I got this dvd for my sister who loves cats, and she said that she really enjoyed watching it. The price was great for me too!",1355875200,,126,3.8846153846153846
4482693,4,B004VJJFZM,Simple little stories very basic information.  I do not like the stories on some of the cats. This needs to do more cat shows.,1355875200,,126,4.25
4482694,5,B004VJJFZM,I enjoy this show on TV and wanted to get my mother one since she has problems with her satellite service and I know she can put this in at anytime and enjoy it.,1355616000,,161,3.764705882352941
4482695,4,B004VJJFZM,"I happen to like cats, finding them generally playful, fascinating pets. My granddaughter also likes cats, thinking I'd order this DVD and she and I might watch it together sometime when she happened to be visiting as she does once in a while. When her next visit came and I put the DVD on, while I was thoroughly engrossed in all the cutely interesting kitty details, I suddenly heard her asking if we could watch something not quite so boring. So maybe someone really does have to be a little older to truly appreciate this type of programming, promptly finding something more exciting for my granddaughter to watch. (A pity to have to watch it alone, but not really as my dog seems to like it pretty well for some reason.)",1348012800,2,725,4.541984732824427
4482696,4,B004VJJFZM,"The series is great like the other reviewers pointed out, but the only problem is that the final episode (number 3) is missing. The full series should be 387 minutes, but they only included 215 minutes. For $5, most people cannot complain much. Otherwise, it's the most fun series on cats. If you want a more scientific one, then check out the National Geographic Cats documentary. This series is focused just on house cats, but the one by national geographic contains wild cats as well.",1338076800,10,487,4.741176470588235
4482697,4,B004VJJFZM,"My daughter loves cats, so I thought this would be a fun, educational dvd for her that would satisfy her desire to constantly stare at, hear about, and otherwise be immersed in cats. However, she referred to it as a ""commercial"" and kept asking when the show was going to start. Eventually she wandered off to play. I liked watching it though!",1337731200,,343,4.548387096774194
4482698,5,B004VJJFZM,"I absolutely love this show. I first saw it at a sleepover at my cousin's house and I thought it was adorable. I started watching clips on YouTube and fell in love with the series. When I heard about this DVD, I immedietly added it to my wish list. I checked it out at my local library (along with Dogs 101, which was also great) and loved it. I have a Maine Coon Mix at home and I watched the Maine Coon part first. The charactheristics of the Maine Coon. Adorable and interesting, this is for cat lovers of all ages!",1315785600,6,518,4.138613861386139
