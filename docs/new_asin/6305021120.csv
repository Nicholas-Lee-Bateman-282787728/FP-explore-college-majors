7880629,5,6305021120,"I saw this a few years ago and have been looking for it. Matt McColm is a Kenpo Master who is a stuntman, This was his first outing as the main actor. What a good action/ Martial art movie. He plays a professional bodyguard who has a conscience and usually can't keep the job to get paid. Check this out!",1377993600,,304,4.083333333333333
7880630,1,6305021120,Just a cheap knockoff z grade cable thriller you watch if you're an insomniac hoping you'll be bored by the 2nd act so you could catch some zzzzz. Don't bother.,1375142400,,160,4.366666666666666
7880631,1,6305021120,This is listed as a 2013 films but it is 1998 made for tv film. Do not pay for it.,1358121600,,82,3.15
7880632,3,6305021120,"Ex-military, black belt professional bodyguard/soldier of fortune Ken Conway (Matt McColm) is recruited by his ex-fianc&eacute;e Marisa (Annabel Schofield), who left him at the altar, to find her missing coworker. The search leads him to world renowned virologist Dr. Ramsey Krago (Ron Perlman), who is secretly creating deadly viruses, releasing them, then ""developing"" an antidote (which he had created in tandem with the virus) and selling it to the highest paying pharmaceutical company. The Doctor infects Conway, via poison ring, with his latest invention, leaving him forty eight hours to get the antidote or die.

Not a bad movie, but not great. The opening music is incredibly tacky. Not the most brilliant dialogue. The lead (McColm) has a tendency to go over the top cocky. Still, worth a watch, in part because of Ron Perlman's performance.  He's the epitome of class and style as the suave, debonair and totally villainous Doctor.  An enjoyable performance as he is so damn smooth and so damn ruthless; a silken snake.",1104796800,3,1031,5.161676646706587
7880633,4,6305021120,"Matt McColm is a former stuntman who has done a few films including this above-average low budget thriller.  McColm plays a bodyguard for hire, aided by his nerdish accountant, the ever ubiquitous Clint Howard.  Along the way he encounters his lovely ex-girlfriend played by Annabell Schofield, and the spider lady Morgan Brittany, who plays the evil assistant to the even more evil Ron Perlman.  Perlman plays the villain with a casual offhandedness that would later aid him greatly in the campy HELLBOY.

In this film, McColm must stop Perlman from his devious plot:  he manufactures a nasty virus, and then to make money, he makes the antedote.  Cool way to make millions, huh?  Things go pretty bad when McColm foolishly shakes Perlman's hand and gets the virus and has only 48 hours to stop Perlman.

Cheesy in some ways, but McColm has a strong, slightly sardonic delivery and the action scenes are pretty effective.

Not bad for a cheepo.",1096934400,4,945,4.8930817610062896
7880634,1,6305021120,"This movie is like a porno.. but without nudity, and without the good music. It's loose plot follows a body gaurd (Matt McColm) trying to protect his client from... well.... I guess this film. He does a poor job, because she's in it. In the end, they do battle with Ron Pearlman, who's bad for one reason or another. Maybe he's pissed he didn't get paid enough, or maybe he didn't pay the filmakers enough to not be in this film. Either way, he's pissed, and out to destroy the world. The camerawork looks like a guy holding the camera with one hand, and lifting weights with the other. Consquently, the camera is never really steady. If you paid the full amount for this DVD, or for that matter, any amount, I suggest you ask for a refund.",980208000,,740,4.369565217391305
