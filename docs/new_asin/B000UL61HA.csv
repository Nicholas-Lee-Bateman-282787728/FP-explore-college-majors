2922269,5,B000UL61HA,This video entertained the children.  They empathized with all the characters and it made them laugh.  They wanted to watch it again as soon as we were finished watching it.  I don't think that has happened before.,1278460800,,214,4.72972972972973
2922270,5,B000UL61HA,"This dvd is on frequent rotation in my car player and I don't get bored of hearing it. Both my daughters love it and the stories, though varied, are all sweet and wholesome. When we planted a garden of our own, my older daughter wanted to watch ""Planting a rainbow"" immediately afterwards to make sure we got all the right flowers!",1271462400,,331,4.442622950819672
2922271,4,B000UL61HA,"Like Trixie, my 3 yr old daughter has a very special bunny.  We fell in love with the Knuffle Bunny and Knuffle Bunny Too books right away.  Our daughter can really relate to Trixie and now and then even calls her bunny 'knuffle bunny'.  As far as the dvd, our daughter loves watching Knuffle Bunny, Planting a Rainbow and Will I Have a Friend?. The other stories don't seem to have her interest, however that is probably just an age or personality thing. I am happy for her to watch books being read to her and word tracking on the screen.  Our daughter loves to be read to, but I think she enjoys seeing some familiar books come alive with animation.",1203811200,4,652,4.363636363636363
2922272,2,B000UL61HA,"Knuffle Bunny is great, it's awesome - but it's only 5 minutes long. The Scholastic Storybook Treasures feature a ""main event"" that gets you to buy the disc. Then they fill the rest of the DVD like the undercard of a major boxing match. The second story - ""Shrinking Violet"" is very good also. Two good stories, but the remaining stories are quite boring. At least, my three and a half year old thought so. Knuffle Bunny and Shrinking Violet are worth the price, just don't expect the full DVD to be as good as Knuffle Bunny.",1202169600,18,525,4.422680412371134
2922273,5,B000UL61HA,"Knuffle Bunny is a wonderful story to share with young children and this video enhances the story by making it even more special. Having both Trixie and her dad narrate makes the story more real.  I used in with my K-2 grade library classes and both boys and girls identified with Trixie losing her bunny.  They all laughed when she started bawling and her daddy tried to hide with her behind a tree. They all also know what going 'boneless"" meant and many admitted that they had gone ""boneless"" more than once.  The love between father and daughter shines bright, making this a must have video for lovers of the book.",1196726400,14,618,4.54954954954955
2922274,4,B000UL61HA,"Knuffle Bunny is one of our family's favorite books and we can't wait to see the DVD. We have other Scholastice Storybook DVDs and have never been disappointed. They are true to the original book, gentle and adorable--we don't even feel guilty letting our children watch them, and our kids absolutely love.",1192579200,4,306,4.903846153846154
8213592,5,B000UL61HA,"Bought it for my niece, apparently taught her how to tantrum to get what she wants. I love it, my sister not so much :)",1435449600,,119,3.8
8213593,4,B000UL61HA,This delightful DVD kept our toddler granddaughter mesmerized for hours on end. My only complaint is that the DVD stuck at one part after watching it so many times!!!,1420243200,,166,4.758620689655173
8213594,4,B000UL61HA,"Scholastic dvd's, this collection in particular, are entertaining and educational.  I recommend parents to include these dvds in their family collections but I cannot recommend them at these prices!  We own many purchased through Amazon but lately sellers are allowed to sell at such ridiculous price, we have looked to newkideo and scholastic for better prices.",1395360000,,362,5.446428571428571
8213595,5,B000UL61HA,Great entertainment for children & the adults who love them. What could be more precious than enjoying high quality story books come to life?,1379808000,,141,4.916666666666667
8213596,5,B000UL61HA,My kids kept asking for this and I bought it for them. They love it. I really enjoy how happy my daughter gets about Knuffle Bunny.,1375747200,,131,4.076923076923077
8213597,5,B000UL61HA,This is the greatest little collection of short videos for very young children.  Great narration and colors.  A special video.,1371081600,,126,5.25
8213598,5,B000UL61HA,"I was impressed by the speed of getting my DVD for my kids.
They love the stories and want more!
Thanks you!!",1370044800,,109,4.0
8213599,4,B000UL61HA,"It's a story of a baby's first words when her father leaves her favorite toy in the laudromat.  (Sadly, it's plausible.)  Her dad cannot figure out why she is so upset and as soon as she arrives home after freaking out, Mom wisely asks where is the Knuffle bunny.  It's also video of a book and it is being read.  It is not a live action video.  My three year old really loves the story and all of the noises that the baby makes prior to saying her first words.",1359590400,,461,4.0777777777777775
8213600,5,B000UL61HA,"I first saw Knuffle Bunny on In Between the Lions and was so excited to find it on DVD. My kids could watch this over and over. It's a story that even parents could appreciate. The other stories are good too. Two disappointments are that we already have the story, Brave Irene on another DVD. A plus to this is that we like the story. The other dissapointment is that we wore this DVD out. Our own fault but, well worth it.",1319328000,,423,4.170731707317073
8213601,5,B000UL61HA,Review is for only Knuffle Bunny.  Just showed my husband the DVD version of Knuffle Bunny.  He LOVED it.  Kept comparing Trixie to our daughter as a baby.  The DVD is so well done.  The music is awesome and keeps the story moving along.  He teared up at the end when Trixie said her first  words.  I have shown this DVD many many times in my school library and it is always a hit. Recommended for everyone of all ages :),1307232000,,421,4.111111111111111
