2682220,1,B000K2V7DW,"I decided to check out this movie since it was from the creators of ""Ong-Bak The Thai Warrior"" and ""The Protector,"" both of which starred Tony Jaa. After watching this movie I can understand why Jaa decided to not waste his incredible martial art talents on it.

The movie starts out well enough for an action flick, with two undercover cops busting a drug lord, then proceeds predictably (VERY predictably) along a classic, stereotypical we've-been-down-this-road-before plotline in which a group of terrorists take hostages at random and demand the release of their leader, the aforementioned drug lord. Halfway though the movie, the main character - one of the two cops from the opening scene - urges the other hostages to stand their ground and fight, since the terrorists have already killed about half the hostages, and he believes everyone will die before the day is done. Just then, the radio the terrorists have allowed the hostages to listen to starts playing the Thai national anthem, and the hostages, energized by patriotism, charge at the bad guys.

What ensues next is probably the most ridiculous and embarrassing excuse for a movie climax I have ever seen. When the hostages first charge the terrorists, many are predictably killed by gunfire, but enough of them break through so they manage to swarm the bad guys and proceed to tackle, flatten, beat, kick, bite, and gouge every baddie they can. So far so good, right? Well, it doesn't take long before the movie ditches logic and reason completely. An old villager who's never held a gun before suddenly goes Rambo after grabbing a discarded gun, a man kicks a soccer ball with his eyes CLOSED and miraculously hits a guy 60 feet away, a teenager suddenly turns into a world-class acrobat and dodges bullets, and a baddie armed with an assault rifle gets taken out by a barehanded five-year old girl.  If the entire movie had been a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top comedy, this kind of scene would be appropriate, but the movie's tone leading up to this moment had been so utterly somber and serious that the sudden, random, unexplained change was just too much to swallow. And the worst part was that the movie was still taking itself seriously and expected the audience to do the same. I had to stop watching the movie before all the cheesiness and campiness made me ill. I wonder if the director got bored and wandered off, and they brought in a seven-year old to take over.",1179187200,7,2444,4.828162291169451
2682221,3,B000K2V7DW,"If you are looking for a movie as good as Ong-Bak or The Protector, then you will be disappointed in this film.  The leading actor just does not have the appeal that Tony Jaa has.

The basic plot is a delegation of the Thai sports' team comes to a small village to provide goodwill. The village is overrun by terrorists, who then bring a nuclear missile into the village.  After half the village is wiped out by the terrorists, they and the delegation are taken to the middle of the village.  After hearing a Thai song/anthem, the whole village is inspired to attack the terrorists.

The movie starts off well, and has some crazy action with 2 semi-trucks and a van.  When I was watching the film, I was amazed how some of the actors did not get killed or permanently injured.  During the credits, they show  how some of the stunts are done.  Some of the actors did get hurt, and one guy almost had his head taken off.  As someone said in a review, those guys better have had some serious medical insurance or signed a death waiver!

The movie did slow down in the middle, but definitely picked up at the end.  Some of scenes were a bit over the top, and this movie really could not decide whether it wanted to be a serious action flick, or a comedy-action movie.

It was an enjoyable movie for the 96 minutes, but definitely not one of the top martial arts movies.",1179100800,2,1365,4.3478260869565215
2682222,1,B000K2V7DW,This was the worst movie I have ever seen im my entire life. don't waste your money,1178496000,2,83,3.9411764705882355
2682223,1,B000K2V7DW,"The highlights of this film is the cinematography and the previews for another movie (Seven Swords) on the DVD!  The intro had potential but the movie dragged in the middle before getting into some serious action toward the end.  The Thai patriotism scene was really the stand up moment of the movie as well as the Buddhist priest scene in the midst of a gunfight.  Perhaps the plot line is a little clearer to those who could listen to it in the original Thai but with sub-titles it is a stretch.  It is a good escape from reality for about 96 minutes and the behind the scene stunt setups were also interesting. If you are expecting lots of martial arts action then this will be a disappointment.  While Born to Fight may have been from the creators of Ong-Bak, they missed the target on this one.  Is it a middle of the road, typical Thai action movie that may develop a limited following in the US.",1178409600,3,902,4.403614457831325
2682224,3,B000K2V7DW,"If you're looking for the recent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Fight/dp/B000K2V7DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Fight</a>""--the one with the terrorists--let me warn you: this is not it. (Or it could be. Amazon has foolishly merged the reviews for both titles, so be sure you're buying the one you want.) Evidently director Panna Rittikrai liked the title enough to reuse it, but only that and a couple of stunts connect this movie and his 2004 so-called remake. (There's not even an IMDb.com listing for this movie.)

On the surface, BTF appears to follow a very simple plot, but it gets so complicated that I still have no idea what was going on. There's some stuff about a lawyer and a notebook, and then some guys in matching jackets beat someone up. (It takes so long to get to the title sequence that a buddy I was watching it with thought it was over and said, ""Is that it?"")

We meet the main character, P'Tong, practicing martial arts with his son and daughter. The Matching Jackets Gang shows up to fight him and he beats them all. I have no idea what the point of that was, because then some guy P'Tong knows (his former boss, I guess) gets out of his car and tells P'Tong he needs to go to the city to find someone.

P'Tong makes it to the city, but everywhere he goes, some new gang tries to beat him up. He meets up with the inescapable comic relief; they find Uncle Jam and then fight some more. Guys in black coveralls and ski masks jump around in the dark and get P'Tong blamed for something or other. There's some nonsense about mistaken identity, but I was never clear on who the bad guys were or why they needed to kidnap Samsung or Sampan or whatever that guy's name was that P'Tong was looking for. At the end, suddenly the ski-mask ninjas show up again. Finally we get a fight scene worth waiting for (and a bunch of painful-looking stunts that Rittikrai recycled for Tony Jaa). But no terrorists.

The comic relief was mostly irritating, but there were a couple of genuinely funny moments. The girl was cute, but absolutely worthless. The one time when I thought she was actually going to fight, she stood up, clenched her fist...and then stepped back and started cheerleading for P'Tong. She deserved the beatdown she got a few minutes later.

I applaud the effort, but for the most part, the experience is like watching any no-budget early-80s cookie-cutter Chinese kung fu movie. In some regards, it's downright primitive: the acting is terrible; people and vehicles obviously start from dead stops at the beginning of takes; and the vehicle chases take place at about five miles per hour. But hey--this movie led to another, and another, and the rest is history.

Overall, ""Born to Fight '86"" may be worth a look if you really like old school martial arts movies, but for technical proficiency and sheer jaw-dropping stunt work, see the remake.",1230595200,,2926,4.784158415841584
2682225,4,B000K2V7DW,It starts off with a crazy scene with two mack trucks and never lets up.  Good Thai movie from the guys who produced ONG BAk and the Protector,1222041600,,142,4.071428571428571
2682226,2,B000K2V7DW,"This flick starts well enough:  In Thailand, an undercover cop (Dan Chupong, ""Dynamite Warrior"") busts a drug kingpin and loses his friend and partner in the process.  While lamenting, he decides to accompany his gymnast sister, and some other athletes, to an economically-challenged village for a charity event.  While there, a group of paramilitary terrorists take over the village, kill large amounts of its residents, and demand the release of the dude that Chupong just put away.  Eventually realizing that they will all be killed, the villagers unite to try and overthrow their captors, completely ignoring their impulses toward the Stockholm Syndrome.

Now if there are good fights and stunts, I can usually handle stupid.  The final 3rd of the movie is ALL action... and couldn't be more boring.  Nearly 30 minutes of face kicking, gun fighting, explosions, and vehicle crashes, 97% of which is in slow-motion, accompanied by guitar-tinged music ripped off from ""The Matrix"".  I guess it wasn't enough to dispense with what little logic it had left.  I'd be a liar if I said that there aren't moments of ""ooh...ahhh..."", but its so ridiculous, and ridiculously done that nearly all entertainment value is jettisoned.

This is easily the worst film I've seen that Dragon Dynasty has released, though I have yet to catch ""Dragon Heat"" and ""Dog Bite Dog"".  I've heard (from sources I trust) that those are even worse.  Be that as it is, I love Dragon Dynasty, and for what they've done with Asian cinema for us North American fans, I'll always be grateful.

Picture quality is widescreen and excellent, as we've come to expect from DD.  In Thai with optional English dub.  Subtitles in English or Spanish.  If this is available in the cheapo-rental section of your local video hut, it may be worth a glance.  Again, there are some VERY impressive stunts, just not enough to make a good movie out of.

2682227,1,B000K2V7DW,"Based on the superb actions in the protector and the ong-bak, I rented this movie form blockbuster. It turned out to be a total waste of time and money. It is pretty much the same as the low low budget films made in Hongkong in 1970s.

Another deceiving fact is that the picture of the lead actor printed on the DVD cover makes him look very much like Tony Laa. I didn't even realized he is not Tony until I started watching the movie for 5 minutes.

Stay away from it.",1190160000,2,469,4.142857142857143
2682228,4,B000K2V7DW,"The stunts really are that gonzo in this!  During the incredible opening sequence, that involves a brawl on the top of 2 parallel moving tractor trailers, a goon gets knocked down between them and his head looks literally INCHES from being crushed by a tire!  I had to watch this scene 5 or 6 times alone.  If the idea of a group of madmen(who you know aren't paid squat!) sacrificing life and limb for some of the most incredible stunts put to celluloid sounds like it would be up your alley, then this is a must see!  However, if the usual stuff like plot, dialogue, believability, character development, etc., is what you're after then you should probably pass on this one.  Dan Chupong is solid as the lead, not so much in the acting department, but he can definately fight(and this is an action movie so...).  He looks and fights similair to Tony Jaa(he's been Jaa's stunt double I think) but isn't quite up to his level of charisma or skill... but how many these days really are?!  As far as actual martial arts goes there isn't a ton, but what is here is quality stuff for the most part... although some of the other athletes fight scenes were groan worthy(if the character played soccer for instance he would fight by kicking random things at the villians?!).  The movie is probably closer to deserving a 3 star rating but I enjoyed it so much I had to give it the extra star(plus the STUNTS!).  Filmed by the same crew that brought us both Ong Bak and The Protector, the camera work has the same stylish and exciting feel and the entire film is really polished and feels like it has a far bigger budget than it actually does.  If you like Jackie Chan's stunt heavy films or even the usual American action blockbusters(whose plots are normally worse than this anyways) make sure to check this out.",1189123200,4,1805,4.50920245398773
2682229,3,B000K2V7DW,"I've been so impressed with the latest string of amazing martial arts movies out of Thailand, that when I saw this i picked it up right away.  The film itself has some amazing stunts & action, but there are two problems with this DVD.  1) The print they used is pretty bad, not remastered at all, still watchable though and 2) It's a fullscreen presentation.  A lot of times this really doesn't matter, but this DVD really shows you its shortcomingsl; you miss some of the flow of the action, as fighters drift in and out of the frame.  I found it frustraing.  The DVD comes with some great extra features, so if you're a fan it's worth owning.  The newer ""Born to Fight"" by Panna has a fantastic Dragon Dynasty release, maybe they should have package both films together.  It needed that professional, respected Dragon Dynasty touch.  This reminds me of those terrible Dimension Jackie Chan & Jet Li DVD releases, definitely put out by a non-fan.  This are one step up with nice bonus features, but the movie like I said is not up to par...Can't wait for what Panna & Tony do for Ong-Bak 2!",1186185600,3,1091,4.46969696969697
2682230,5,B000K2V7DW,"Anybody who enjoys both old 70's kung fu films and modern action masterpieces like Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong - will think this title is a terrific addition to their collection.  The fight sequences were filmed with nearly all full contact for brutal realism and they are excellent, especially for their time, - and seeing Tony Jaa's mentor Panna Rittikrai as a lead will make you a big fan of him as well.

As long as you set your expectations to what you will be getting (a low-budget Thai B-movie from 1986 after all!), you will be amazed.  The fights are choreographed and play out like a combination of the modern style used in Ong Bak and that used in older Wu-Tang Clan style kung fu movies.  But you won't be disappointed - I was personally surprised to see a ton of great slow motion, double takes, and editing in the fights to allow the viewer to really see the punishing impacts.

One thing that surprised me about this film is that THE DUB IS EXCELLENT!!!  I am normally somebody who HATES watching live-action dubbed but I was shocked to see just how perfect the voices used were and how spot-on the ""acting""/matching/and writing of the dub were.  In part a lot of it's value comes from the dub having great ""camp"" flavor but it mostly stays true to the script and, IMO, improves the movie a great deal for English-speaking fans who just want to kick back and enjoy the experience.

The story is pretty basic but it generally works to stage the action, keep you interested, and add a little comedy here and there.  You could nitpick some of its faults (at times things can get a little slow or dry) but who cares - you came to see some great fight/stunt sequences.  And you do get quite a few cool ones!

Generally there is an entertaining fight on screen every ten minutes of it's runtime.  In several different scenes, Panna is outnumbered by a gang of guys attacking him one after another and he dispatches them with great, brutal Muy Thai mixed martial arts.  Two standout scenes are a motorcyle chase sequence that features at least two ""oh my god, rewind that NOW!"" kinds of moments and the finale where Panna goes up against a gang of ninjas.  Taking the ninjas on in a forest clearing, - fighting hand-to-hand, with weapons, and on a wooden platform - the stuntmen are really tested as several brutal moves are executed in a scene that plays out like an early version of the very last scene in Ong Bak.

This DVD is likely as good a treatment as this movie will get too.  Comparing the video of the feature versus some of its footage shown during the extras, it is obvious that they used the cleanest print of the film that they could find.  It is presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio, which is either likely the way in which it was originally filmed or the only way we are likely to see it since so many of these early Thai films seem to have been preserved only in 4:3 with much of the original film stock expired (see the ""Ong Bak 2"" entry on Wikipedia).  The extras are nice too and are all thankfully subtitled in English.

A detailed interview with Tony Jaa on a Thai talk show provides a lot of insight into Tony Jaa's early beginnings and into his relationship with Panna, the star of this film.  Clips of Tony Jaa demonstrating his moves and cool scenes from some other early Thai B-movies he starred in are also shown.  It's a great addition and the best extra on the disc.  The 30+ minute documentary that follows a stuntman going through the process of being hired by Jaa's production company is also interesting and insightful but probably not something you will want to see more than once.  There are two ""Ong Bak spoofs"" as well but these are mostly throw-away extras that will likely just leave you confused and disinterested.

Overall this is a fun, engaging title that I hope has some success on DVD so we can see more hidden gems like it released on our shores.",1182729600,7,3897,4.448663853727145
2682231,4,B000K2V7DW,"Please note, that there are two versions of this film available.  There is the 1986 born to fight, and the 2004 remake (by ironically the same director).  The 1986 version contains a special feature Tony Jaa talking about why he liked the movie and how it influenced him, as well as a spoof of ong bak, with the 1986 film.  The 2004 is a more lean and mean movie, released by Dragon Dynasty, with different special features.  Make sure you know what you're getting before you pruchase it.

With the 2004 version, I will review.  I thought the action sequences were amazing.  I'm always shocked the lengths someone will go for a stunt.  This, like Ong Bak, is showing a growing trend among loosing the unreality and CG in favor of more real action.  The trouble is the plot is rather bland, and goes no where.  However, if you liked the protector, and could get past the ""where's my elephant?"" storyline, then this shouldn't phase you too much.  Also, Tony Jaa is sorley missing from this movie.  He is great at action, but has a bit of charisma and acting talent, which is also lacking from this movie.  But I digress.  It is entertaining and I recomend it.",1180483200,8,1157,4.5
2682232,5,B000K2V7DW,"Hands down one of the best action/martial arts movies ever!  The action sequences are brilliantly done.  Like all martial arts movies, it has those cheesy moments that you have come to expect.  Buy this movie.",1180224000,3,209,4.914285714285715
2682233,5,B000K2V7DW,"The reviews listed are not for this ORIGINAL VERSION which was made in 1986!

This version of Born to Fight is the film Tony Jaa saw as a kid and it chaned his life apparently.
There's an interview with him on the disc where the host asks him who influenced him.
What it Jackie Chan?No. Jet Li? no. Then who? Born to Fight is his answer.

His teacher and mentor Panna is the star of this film and he apparently wrote and directed too.
It's a low budget affair but is packed with great action and stunts.

MANY OF THE ACTION SCENES HAVE MOVES LATER USED IN ONG BAK!
Too many to mention but they have that double knee drop and many of the elbow moves.

This is somewhat better than the remake in certain ways.
The new version has some amazing stunts and a much bigger budget but this original seems more honest and Panna is a combination of Bruce Lee,Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa.
One stunt in particular involves a motorcycle and pick up truck which must be seen!
Also some two on one action from the last scene are exceptional.
Definitely worth checking out!

The bonus features are fantastic.
There's the demo and interview with Tony Jaa and Panna which is very interesting and entertaining.
Tony displays some incredible moves and Panna is beaming like a proud parent.
The producer of the film talks for a few minutes but it's nothing special.
Some comdy sketaches are included which show the impact of Ong Bak in Thai society.
Some of the humor gets lost in the translation for sure.

The highlight is a show called Fearless Maniacs which takes you inside Pannas training camp and shows what it takes to join his team.
It's a recent production and you can recognize many of the team that appeared in Spirited Killer and Born to Fight.
This piece and Tony Jaas interview segment make the purchase price worth it alone.
Best Buy has an extra exclusive Panna movie included!

8154170,4,B000K2V7DW,"I'm not sure why Amazon insists on linking the reviews of all the movies with the same title -- since there are often many releases of the same movie (often, of very different quality and with different features), and in this case, entirely different movies with the same name, how the hell do you know what movie is really being reviewed?

Having gotten that off my chest, I really liked this newer ""Dragon Dynasty"" release.  You can smell the ""Ong Bak"" influence all over it -- so much so that you really wonder why they didn't just cast Tony Jaa in the lead (hell, even the lead henchman in ""Ong Bak"" is the lead henchman in ""Born to Fight""!).  Story is nothing special, though I found it surprisingly heartbreaking at times (though it does take the cheap and easy route to identify who is very good and who is very bad -- with one notable exception, who could have been better developed -- the character ""Tub"").

What you really watch this for is, of course, the stunts and the fighting.  The latter wasn't anything special -- again, there are many nods to ""Ong Bak"" (and some direct ripoffs from fights in that movie).  What sets the movie apart are its numerous jawdropping stunts.  You are left to wonder how anyone didn't die making this movie.  Often, I jumped back while watching this, yelling ""ouch!"" and ""ohh!""  You will too!

The things I were least impressed with were some of the acting, some of the silly fight parts with the soccer balls (you really have to suspend disbelief, though they 'are' entertaining), and the badly done CGI (you'll know what I mean).

This, like many other recent Thai action movies, does stand in the shadow of the mighty ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector,"" but it 'is' a very entertaining movie -- one you'll want to watch with friends, so you can all go ""Ouch!"" together.  Some violent bits but no real gore (unless you count the bazooka-Rambo bit near the end).
