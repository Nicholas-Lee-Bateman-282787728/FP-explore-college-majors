3525873,2,B001D5C1QM,Justine: The Misfortunes of Virtue. The story was slow-moving and disjointed. I wondered where it was headed. The ending was not realistic and too bloody.,1353715200,2,154,5.2
3525874,2,B001D5C1QM,"This movie IS NOT with Glory Annen of Felicity. This is a Koo Stark movie. Amazon.com has a listing problem. I ordered this DVD twice, I returned first one, amazon.com sent the other both had different DVD cover but same Koo Stark movie. I checked online Glory Annen never made this movie. Footnote is Amazon.com customer service shined with their service and their prompt plus appropriate replies. Kudos to customer service team but DVD is incorrect.",1339459200,,451,4.947368421052632
3525875,5,B001D5C1QM,"This highly erotic movie features, Koo Stark and Glory Annen of Felicity fame (the movie, not the tv series).  It also highlights the pitfalls of being too good (which is sad).  Otherwise, not bad.",1265328000,,197,4.764705882352941
3525876,2,B001D5C1QM,"When I got this I expected to see Glory Annen ( Felicity) in it. Instead it was the Koo Stark version. It was an OK movie, but as far as Koo Stark goes, I liked the Movie ""Emily"" better. It is an Ok rental, but I wouldn't buy it. It is rather tame and would be Rated ""R"" by todays standards, because of the Nudity and subject matter, and the Nudity is somewhat subdued. There are probably better versions of this story available.",1230163200,7,429,4.180722891566265
3525877,5,B001D5C1QM,"I've been looking for Justine for years, and finally found it.  It was a good copy delivered in a timely manner, too.",1224892800,,117,4.318181818181818
3525878,4,B001D5C1QM,"Re the previous review, note that the scenes Redemption cut for the new DVD release are intact on their 1990s VHS release.",1215907200,16,122,4.590909090909091
3525879,2,B001D5C1QM,"This is a bizarre and original adaptation of De Sade's ""Justine: Or The Misfortunes of Virtue.""  The original title was ""Cruel Passion.""  Unfortunately, ""Redemption"" has been censoring their films lately: this one was among those that suffered from some cutting.  What was wonderful about ""Redemption"" was that they released obscure and artistic horror films intact, but that hasn't been the case lately.  I've only seen this film complete on video.  I would have rated it four stars if ""Redemption"" hadn't hacked it to pieces...",1198540800,22,529,5.25
3525880,5,B001D5C1QM,Do not listen to the previous review this is not a jess franco film......This is an artistic obscure film from the seventies Based om marquis de sade You will not be dissapointed by this film. Redemption films by Image entertainment are very rare artistic horror movies. If you like mainstream Horror Stay Away This movie is not for you. Only For those who appreciate quality old fashioned Horror............,1168387200,9,408,5.014705882352941
3525881,1,B001D5C1QM,"No sleaze fan needs to know anything about the basic story, so there are really only three questions; does Koo Stark out perv Romina Power, is there anything to match the ""M"" scene and what's the level of abuse? The answers are no, no, and it's pitiful.

Say what you want about Jess Franco, because I'll say plenty, mainly that he couldn't film a proper whipping scene to save his life, and his version of ""Justine"" is just awful, some potentially good scenes ruined by the trademark Franco red and green light treatment. But, every now and then, like the proverbial blind pig finding an acorn, he lucked into something good, like the hankerchief-sniffing branding scene, which is essential. Well, just forget about that here, no instrument of torture comes anywhere near Ms. Stark. She's nude a bit, and loved up some, but no ""M"" mars her chest at the premature end of this short and useless version of the classic.

The other reason why Franco's version was sleaze-worthy in the lol direction (in bad taste of course, but what about sleaze isn't?) was the rather young age of Romina Power, rumored to be appropriate for her actual age in real life. Koo Stark tries to look young, but the only reason she kinda pulls it off is that's she's flat. There's a world of difference between her hard little raisins and Romina's virginal baby taps.

Overall there's some nudity, a little nun lez, but that's not enough to rate even a half star. But maybe the minimum one sleaze star for the FBF (famous bosom factor, or lack thereof in this case), though nowadays probably there aren't that many who even remember why Ms. Stark was famous at all. Hint: royalty.",1149811200,10,1655,4.660958904109589

3525885,1,B001D5C1QM,I couldn't believe that how terrible this movie was.,1429056000,,52,4.888888888888889

3525888,3,B001D5C1QM,"The movie is definitely ""B"" quality but what is most interesting is De Sade's message.  Virginity and sexual chastity is overrated,and a woman should seek sexual depravity to please her husband.  Be a good whore or a good whore for your husband; either way, be a good whore.  Got to give it to him, De Sade had a one track mind.",1410566400,4,328,4.344262295081967
3525889,2,B001D5C1QM,The movie is very slow in getting started.  It took me several starts and stops to watch it.  Not recommended.,1408406400,,110,4.45

3525892,1,B001D5C1QM,I don't know but I didn't like it. Just didn't flow well. But I guess It's an old film that's why.,1404259200,,98,3.7142857142857144
3525893,1,B001D5C1QM,"There is little worth watching here. Dull script only loosely based on De Sade's writings, poor acting and directing, cinematography is flat, print is grainy and low res. Only for those who like bashing Catholic institutions and juvenile sexual titillation.",1398816000,,257,5.45
3525894,2,B001D5C1QM,"Not to be a spoiler, but the ending was just horrific.  What I know of Sade, which granted is not in depth, is not criminal rape and murder, so I was shocked.  The rest of Justine's difficult experiences are in keeping with what I know of his type of stories. But I have not read this one, so it may be accurate.",1395532800,,312,4.016129032258065
3525895,2,B001D5C1QM,"Lacked the promised (and literary) erotic punch I expected.  I am glad I finally saw it, but won't be revisiting",1393891200,,112,4.6
3525896,2,B001D5C1QM,"... reduced to a thriller with overtones of sexual perversion and violence (what would you expect from de Sade?) but it never quite fits together. The plot moves along slowly and actions are never explained or justified. The acting is routine, but a more-or-less comic section which supposedly takes place in a bordello of the period is amusing and over-the-top; but that is the only part of interest.",1392681600,,401,4.911764705882353
3525897,3,B001D5C1QM,This film is a re-release of a classic.  It is all cleaned up including the sound track.  For those who like this stuff it is a relief from watching the original release which was noisy.,1392076800,,186,4.285714285714286
3525898,4,B001D5C1QM,"Ya gotta love the ""oldies""... the only thing fake on the girls were their eyelashes! You could tell they're testing the boundaries with nudity and sex. Decent story line too... Somewhat ""Franco-esque""  Overall... ENTERTAINING!!!!",1391644800,,229,5.735294117647059
3525899,1,B001D5C1QM,"Didn't care for the movie. Old men still believing, that is all women are here for. Here for thier exploitation. If that is all we are here for God would have made us domestic animals.",1389571200,,184,4.285714285714286

3525901,1,B001D5C1QM,"A stupid movie. A waste of any ones time.
At least, Justine is a beautiful young lady.
Marquis would be offended with this poor and amateur production.
The end does't make any sense.",1377475200,,182,4.545454545454546
3525912,3,B001D5C1QM,"As stated above, there exists a large marketing base of adult devotees of BDSM, and nothing offered by Amazon that I have found so far comes close to satisfying that.  Need to make available such films as ""
The Story of O"" and ""Behind the Green Door"", as well as lesser known films of that era.",1373328000,4,294,4.25
3525913,3,B001D5C1QM,well this is the movie for you.  Koo Stark was a thorn in the side of the Queen of England because she made a few soft-core porns featuring her in some girl-girl action.  This is one of those movies.,1372204800,8,199,4.076923076923077

3525917,1,B001D5C1QM,not worth the time  - comes across like soft porn with no story and amateur acting - the giggling man was ludicrous,1365033600,,115,4.2272727272727275
3525918,3,B001D5C1QM,"This movie has some high points, but lots of non-sequiturs... Lack of continuity and seriousness -- it could have been a good movie ... the theme is interesting",1363219200,,160,4.75
3525919,1,B001D5C1QM,"Poorly scripted, poorly made, poorly acted, and not even close to being based on de Sade's works.  The Marquis probably rolls over in his grave every time this video gets a view.  There is a better version (still poorly made, but at least true to de Sade's visions) called Marquis de Sade's Justine from 1969.  If you're interested in understanding de Sade, check that one out instead.",1361232000,5,385,4.7164179104477615
