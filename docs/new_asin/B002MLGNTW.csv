8373951,5,B002MLGNTW,"This play was a real surprise to me since I did not know anything about it before I watched it. It starts with something that is just plain gross. Pericles finds himself in Antioch one day because he is in love with the unnamed daughter of the local king, Antiochus who set him in front of a book with a riddle:

I am no viper, yet I feed
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
I sought a husband, in which labour
I found that kindness in a father:
He's father, son, and husband mild;
I mother, wife, and yet his child.
How they may be, and yet in two,
As you will live, resolve it you. (Act I Scene 1)

Pericles understands the riddle: the father is in love with the daughter (because the mother died in childbirth) and the daughter repays her father with her own love. In other words they are incestuous. Pericles is shocked and he manages to escape before he is put to death by Antiochus. Back in Tyre he takes to the sea again to escape the menace since Antiochus had sent one of his servants to poison him.

From there we enter a succession of shipwrecks and serious problems because fate is against Pericles and the people he finds himself associated to. His first shipwreck brings him to Pentapolis where he gets into some chivalry contest and ends up marrying the daughter, Thaisa, of the King, Simonides. When she is advanced in pregnancy they decide to go back to Tyre. A second shipwreck disturbs the delivery of the baby, a daughter called Marina. The mother apparently dies in childbirth (Note like the wife of Antiochus and mother of the unnamed daughter). She is put in some sealed wooden coffin and entrusted to the sea for burial. She ends up in Ephesus where a learned physician revives her. She decides to live her widowhood by retiring in the close-by Temple to Diana. In the meantime Pericles entrusts the child to a nurse under the care of Cleon, the local Governor, and his wife Dionyza in Tharsus. They have a daughter of their own, but the mother becomes jealous of Marina who prevents her own daughter to shine. So Dionyza decides to have Marina killed.

But Marina, just before being put to death, is abducted by some pirates and taken away. Cleon and Dianyza decide to bury Marina as if she were dead, though they probably do not know her fate. She is sold to a shady house where she is saved by the Governor of Mitylene, Lysimachus, who came there to use her. But he feels her good breeding and education and actually gives her enough money to bribe the doorkeeper of the shady house who releases her and she ends up in MItylene under the protection of the Governor Lysimachus.

In the meantime Pericles went to the fake funeral of his daughter and he loses his common sense and sanity. But he is taken around in a ship by his own people looking for who knows what since for him both his wife and his daughter are dead and buried. Thats how he ends up in Mitylene where the governor visits him on his ship and suggests Marina to bring him back to sanity. What had to happen happens. Marina reveals herself and he recognizes her but his emotion is so strong that he falls back into insanity. Thats when he has a dream of Diana telling him to go to her temple in Ephesus to tell his story there. So he does with everyone else. His wife Thaisa recognizes him, and then the ring he is wearing that was given to him by her father. Family reunion ensues.

This play is totally, will I say, different from many others. We could say that Shakespeare often uses tempests and storms. We could say he often uses shipwrecks and insanity. We could see many other elements that can be found in other plays. Yet there are some elements that are unique here.

First there is a story teller that enables us to jump from one scene to the next, from one port to another. The story teller is also a sort of philosopher who tells us some morality about these events. The incestuous king and his daughter in Antiochus are also unique and cannot compare with Hamlets uncle and Hamlets mother which can be seen as adulterous  with some incestuous tinge to it. The extreme dramatic matter in the whole play is also original for a situation that ends well and turns the play into a sort of comedy, though it is a lot darker than The Tempest for example. Shady houses are common in Shakespeare, even in the historical plays or the tragedies. Think for example of Hamlet and his nunnery or of Falstaff who plays the rogue in shady houses and taverns with Henry IV and Henry V.

What is more surprising is the double estrangement of the mother and the daughter from the father. One is common enough but two is rare if not unique. The dark nature of human beings is unluckily common in Shakespeare but here we really reach an unusual level: incest, poisoners, assassins, untrustworthy nobles (or high ranking people), shady house personnel, the matron and her husband plus a gate keeper, slavery (and a slave market) with pirates, insanity, direct intervention of Diana, a goddess, etc.

This production takes advantage of the various locales and the vast peregrinations in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea with Greece, the Phoenicians, and some other people roaming around particularly in Antioch, a city that is both Syrian and Jewish, Syrian by the king and Jewish by the presence of numerous Jews there in very integrated and respected positions, and The Jewish Encyclopedia says (http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1586-antioch):

From ""Megillat Antiochus"" it is evident that the Jews considered Antiochus Epiphanes the founder (""Rev. &Eacute;t. Juives,"" xxx. 218). Antioch, as the chief city of Syria, was the seat of the Roman governor, whose jurisdiction extended over Palestine also. A large number of Jews resided in Antioch from its foundation (Josephus, ""B. J."" vii. 3,  3), and received from Seleucus Nicator all the rights of citizenship (Josephus, ""Ant."" xii. 3,  1). Their privileges were inscribed upon tablets of brass and carefully guarded. Their communal head bore the title of archon; and the Syrian kings succeeding Antiochus Epiphanes gave many votive offerings to the Synagogue. When the heathen inhabitants of Antioch besieged Demetrius Nicator in the royal palace, they were put to flight by the Maccabean Jonathan (ib. xiii. 5,  3). To the credit of the Antiochians be it said, that they lamented, no less sincerely than the Jews, the death of the upright high priest Onias, who was murdered by command of Menelaus, in Daphne, a beautiful suburb of Antioch (II Macc. iv. 33; somewhat differently, ""Ant."" xii. 5,  1). Mark Antony commanded the Antiochians to return to the Jews everything of which they had deprived them (""Ant."" xiv. 12,  6).

This would imply some understood anti-Semitism but Shakespeare has quite a few elements going that way in all his plays like Aaron the Moor in Titus Andronicus (to quote one generally unseen element of the type) though probably a lot more moderate than most people in his time. Here incestuous Antiochus and daughter are destroyed by divine fire, thus purifying the sin, and sin it is declared from the very start:

But custom what they did begin
Was with long use account no sin.
The beauty of this sinful dame
Made many princes thither frame,
To seek her as a bed-fellow,
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow (Act I, Prologue)

Tyre itself is an essential city in the Old Testament because it is connected to David and Solomon like in 1 Kings 5:1: When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David. The Phoenicians of Tyre played an important role in the building of Solomons Temple in Jerusalem who is considered by some as built on the model of Tyres Melqarts Temple:

Solomon's Temple Copy of Melqart's Temple
After studying records about Solomon's Temple and Melqart's Temple, one finds a lot in common between the two. It would not be a far-fetched suggestion to say that Solomon's Temple of Jerusalem was a copy of Melqart's Temple of Tyre. Because of the splendor it occupied in their mind, it is understandable that the Phoenician builders must have used Melqart's Temple as a prototype for designing and building Solomon's Temple. (http://phoenicia.org/temple.html)

All that background is present in the play and was present in the minds of reformed Elizabethan England keen on reading and meditating on the Old Testament. This production thus insists on us seeing the diversity of this region of the world by having the play performed in various open landscapes and different constructed city scenes or palaces and houses, not to speak of the ships. This will explain the length of the play, more than three hours. It is of course low definition color television but still with a lot of black and white TV sets in many homes, so the colors are not very brilliant or flashy: mostly various shades of grey, black, white and some brown (more or less reddish) that must have come dark grey on a black and white screen. White of course is very powerful in such a situation and it contrasts very well with the dark colors of a color television. Of course these old films have not been re-mastered properly so that most actors look short on their legs and kind of wrapped up if not on the side of fatness as soon as they are at a certain distance. It is nearly funny to see the actors coming from a distance slightly getting thinner and taller as they approach the camera. But what a treat of emotions with great actors for the main parts!

8373952,4,B002MLGNTW,"Excellent production of Shakespeare's Pericles. I believe that Shakespeare wrote the entire play, but there is no way to prove one way or the other. The important thing is to watch the play and enjoy it's beauty. I liked Mike Gwilym's performance as Pericles; however, I have no other performances to compare to it. Juliet Stevenson was excellent as Thaisa. I highly recommend this production of Shakespeare's Pericles.",1468886400,,419,5.176470588235294
8373953,4,B002MLGNTW,"The only DVD of William Shakespeare's Pericles is this BBC version, and you'll have to go to amazon.co.uk to buy it.  It is minor Shakespeare, written in collaboration with another writer.  It really isn't that bad.  Critics point to the long last act, in which everybody tells everybody else what is happening, as evidence that the play is flawed.  George Bernard Shaw did his own version of the last act, but acknowledged that Shakespeare's version was really just fine.",1433808000,,472,4.936708860759493
8373954,5,B002MLGNTW,"Here's an opportunity to see Pericles, a play that definitely bears the mark of Shakespeare's unique verbal genius, but to whom only less than half of the text is attributed.  A convoluted saga, a tragedy that ends well, and one of the least performed of the plays attributed to him.  I really enjoyed reading the play with a group, but there was much that I did not understand until I watched this production, in which high-caliber acting combines with unique director's choices to achieve a very understandable, accessible and interesting Pericles.",1364688000,,550,5.032967032967033

I am passionately devoted to this BBC series of televised productions of Shakespeare's plays.  One of my happiest memories was gathering for a house party with the troupe with whom I acted in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and as we nibbled on cheese and crackers and spilled wine, gathered in a cozy living room, we watched one of these plays (I think it was THE TEMPEST) on telly--and to view it with a troupe of Shakespearean players was delicious.  My introduction to the plays was as a high school student in love with acting, and now, in my twilight years, I appreciate the Bard more fully as a poet.  The plays make for wonderful reading, but they were meant to be performed, and these BBC productions are, for me, among the finest presentations of the plays.  They have so spoiled me by their excellence that I rarely attend local stage productions of Shakespeare, where I am almost always disappointed, alas--live Shakespeare, when well done, is an awesome experience.

Mike Gwilym is excellent in the title role--so different from his role in LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST, where he is a superb Berowne.  We follow him through his journey of fortunes found and lost, and Gwilym is entirely effective with this yo-yo of emotions that the role demands.  His bearing in indeed princely.  He speaks the lines very well, always so vitally important with this playwright.

The dance sequences of this production charmed me.  There is a fabulous Dance of the Knights in Act II, Scene 3, where the fellows dance with swords, which is then followed and contrasted by a dance with the Knights and the Ladies, wherein we see the budding romance between Pericles and Thaisa, which is beautifully conveyed.  Juliet Stevenson has a subtle grace that enhances her performance as Thaisa, and one grows so fond of her that her temporary fate at sea is truly heartbreaking.

One aspect of Shakespeare's genius as a playwright is that he infuses the smallest of roles with dramatic potency and possibility.  This is especially manifest  in this production with Clive Swift's brief but entirely effective portrayal of Lord Cerimon.  It seems almost as aspect of fairy tale, this sequence of the storm at sea, the burial of a Queen in a coffin that is thrust into the waves, and the resuscitation of the dead one by ""secret arts.""  With music and medicine, Thaisa is strangely awakened from death.  We are made to understand that this is a miracle.  ""Is not this strange?"" one Gentleman ponders.  ""Most rare,"" seconds another.  Mr. Swift, initially, appears as a merry helpful fellow; but when he works his secret art, he becomes a force of wisdom and wonder.  His portrayal is simply magnificent and the scene is mesmerizing.

Edward Petherbridge is quite good as the poet John Gower, who serves as Chorus.  One scene in particular is most effective, at the beginning of Act III, where Gower speaks a scene that is shewn in pantomime.  The scene is described, in part, thus, in the Arden Shakespeare edition edited by Suzanne Gossett:

[following Gower's line, ""What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.""]
""[Dumb-show] Enter PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door with Attendents; a Messenger meets them, kneels and gives Pericles a letter.  Pericles shows it to Simonides, the Lords kneel to him.  Then enters THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA, a nurse."" &c &c.

I really want to know if this description is original to Shakespeare, but PERICLES is not included in the First Folio, which I have in the splendid Norton Facsimile.  It has been a while since I have studied the history of the play, but now I am keen to do so

I really love this production and highly recommend this production on either VHS or DVD.",1316390400,7,4101,4.890014471780029
8373956,4,B002MLGNTW,"Pericles Prince of Tyre has been a controversial part of the Shakespeare canon from the outset. It was not included in the original editions and was widely and correctly viewed as a collaboration with a lesser author. However, its reputation has slowly been increasing as a better understanding of Shakespeare's late interest in romance and fable has been gained in the past 50 years.

I am not a big fan of the BBC Shakespeare TV productions made in the 70s and 80s. however, Pericles is one of their better efforts. As always there are significant issues with the production and some of the acting but on balance some evocativeness has been retained. The problem areas are primarily with skimpy, clunky sets in several scenes and the acting of Gower and Pericles. Both actors significantly underplay the parts. Gower is positively soporific. However they are not offensive or bad either. Some of the other performers are quite good such as Thaisa, Marina and Cerimon. A qualified recommendation but if you want to see Pericles outside the theater this is probably the only option for the foreseeable future.",1297123200,2,1109,4.962365591397849
