8742191,5,B018EIXYDE,Good information for anyone thinking of buying and carrying a firearm for protection.,1517270400,,85,5.615384615384615
8742192,5,B018EIXYDE,"I have taken a lot of instruction from Cazz over the past few years.  One is getting a tremendous value through this video instruction.  There is no substitute for having your heart rate elevated and adrenalin through the roof while Cazz thunders away at you.  However, this is the closest instruction to having him by your side.  You can review at your own pace and practice at home with snap caps or even air soft pistols to drill in the instruction.  Simple indoor range practice is just not realistic.  Enjoy the video, practice and learn some real world pistol handling from one of the best.  Thank you for reading!",1483401600,,620,4.63302752293578
8742193,5,B018EIXYDE,Wish Altair would come up with more videos.,1482710400,,43,4.5
8742194,5,B018EIXYDE,"Very professional editing and film quality. I can't believe how polished Cazz is on TV, he is a great instructor if you ever have the chance to work with him live. The fire arms content is very good, clear, and well explained/demonstrated. Good to see owners, instructors/employees, and members in the video, keeps the viewer(s) interested rather than another dry gun how to video. And we have all seen a bunch of those. Haven't we?  The range card is a nice touch for reference stored in a range bag or your back pocket.",1459123200,,521,4.602150537634409
8742195,5,B018EIXYDE,"I highly recommend this video to new & experienced shooters alike.  The instructor, Cazz, explains the fundamentals of shooting from beginning to end, and does it in such a way, that you understand, not just the how of the stance, grip, draw, aim etc, but the why of those things, that makes them an effective technique.  While giving the how and why of things, Cazz continuously emphasizes safe handling & operation of the pistol, as well as the responsibility inherent in gun ownership.  The production quality of the video is also excellent, with animated graphics depicting how revolvers & semi-auto pistols work.  Very professional production & instruction.",1459036800,,662,5.158878504672897
8742196,5,B018EIXYDE,Best I've ever seen. For beginners to sharp shooters. Instructor Cazz is best you can ask for! 5 stars,1455062400,,102,4.421052631578948
