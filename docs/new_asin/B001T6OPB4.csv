3788184,1,B001T6OPB4,"ok, so... this is the last time I EVER watch a movie without reading the reviews first! Because had I read the reviews, I wld have not wasted the last 2 hours of my life. This movie is soo... I don't even have the words for it. It's crazy because it starts out pretty good and then... I felt towards the end there was a gradual decline in content. Also the direction of the movie went to places that just don't make sense. I think the director or writer went into an LSD trance halfway through and couldn't figure out ... hell idk. It was a tug of war with the moral dilemma of being a lesbian. And a huge turn at the end, which I STILL don't get and an old war vet that pops up out of nowhere. It was jus.. ridiculous! I could have made a better story making a slideshow in powerpoint.",1302652800,31,786,4.044871794871795
3788185,1,B001T6OPB4,"It's a miracle I finished watching this movie. This movie had so much potential to be such a heart wrenching tear jerker, but instead, with its choppy scenes, sub-par acting, random connections that are tied miserably to fate, etc. do nothing but jerk the watcher around as in a bumpy roller coaster ride of nonsense. I was truly disappointed.",1301875200,16,343,4.830508474576271
3788186,1,B001T6OPB4,"Wow, where do I begin? This movie had and I do mean had the potential to be an interesting, even heart tugging drama. However, it ends up being a mixed up jumble of mixed messages and crazy mishaps masquerading as fate or destiny or some nonsense. The acting is sub-par to say the least with the best performance being delivered by the lead actress, who I believe also co-stars in A Marine Story, but I digress. What a load of crap, and please forgive me I just finished the grueling task of watching this film to completion and would really like a refund from Amazon Instant Video right now. Nevertheless, save yourself the trouble by skipping this one completely! It veers all over the place and never really hones in on the actual point of the film. It appears as though messages about family, love, God and fate are tossed in randomly with no adherance to the slightest filmaking nuiance. It is choppy and feels like a low budget B movie that should get an F. Look, I'm rambling at this point so let me just conclude by stating that this was a collossal waste of two hours that I will never get back.",1301788800,28,1104,4.416666666666667
3788187,1,B001T6OPB4,"This is literally the worse film, and I use the term loosely that I have ever seen. When I finished watching (and only out of curiosity) the DVD went straight to the garbage.
The two lead actresses have potential. There are a couple of scenes when there relationship seems genuine, but the script is badly written, with much to-do-about-nothing dialogue and unclear ""conclusions"". The husband seems more like a porn actor than an ex-marine and the evangelical christian seems like a character out of a looney toons episode.
There is no evolution of the feelings. Scenes come and go and there is never a sense of what is actually going thru the characters minds except when they say it. For example, when Sidney says "" I wanted to kiss you since the first time I saw you"". Really???? You could have fooled me with your non-chalant attitude. That's what acting is for... to reflect feelings not croak bad dialogue.
The evangelical christian is an eye sore and the story so awfully told that at some point we were wondering if this was actually a born again christian film disguissed as lesbian themed.
I am a supporter of the arts, but there is a line that should not be crossed. This project should not have ever made it to film and I should never have spend $15 on it.
I set complete responsability of this disaster on the writer/director. Hope she has more sense (a lot of it) next time.",1265673600,11,1388,4.578313253012048
3788188,5,B001T6OPB4,This is a great movie that will keep you glued to the t.v until it is over. The characters in the movie were awesome. One reason why this is a good movie is because it is based on true life. There isn't a lot of movies that lesbians today can relate to or they can feel that they can connect with. Another reason why this is a great movie is because at the end there is an unexpected surprise. I spend days thinking about the movie and just wanted to keep watching it over and over again. It is worth buying.,1252713600,4,508,4.03960396039604
3788189,4,B001T6OPB4,"I didn't expect much from this movie after I read all the bad reviews, but I have to say I really liked this movie. Certainly it is not a typical Hollywood Blockbuster - but to me it seemed quite authentical. The actresses are gorgeous and the performance is ok for an indie movie. 4 stars because I think the subplot is a bit ham and sometimes too long without any particular meaning.",1250553600,6,385,4.361111111111111
3788190,1,B001T6OPB4,"I agree with all the negative statements made by other reviewers about the bad acting, the bad script, the bad music, etc; this is the most preposterous movie I've seen in a long time. There's no way it's worth even one star. But the worst part to me is the message that being a lesbian is bad, but if you are a lesbian, Jesus can help you. That stood out to me like a sore thumb because there simply was no other reason for the Christian lesbian to be in the movie. It wasn't a blatant message, but it certainly wasn't subtle either. And it was like the final nail in the movie's coffin.
(I don't know anything about the writer; if she's a lesbian, she DEFINITELY needs to find another line of work!)",1246838400,16,701,4.2388059701492535
3788191,3,B001T6OPB4,"A film about a woman who leaves her traditional, heterosexual marriage to find love and happiness in the arms of another woman is not new.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lianna/dp/B00009Y3N1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lianna</a>&nbsp;(1983) dealt with this topic as did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desert-Hearts/dp/B000OVLC0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desert Hearts</a>&nbsp;(1985). Of these three films, ""Running on Empty Dreams"" is the least. That is not, however, to say that it is entirely without merit. But there are significant flaws.

""Running on Empty Dreams"" begins when Sydney Harris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathleen-Benner/dp/B000FUF6TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathleen Benner</a>) is diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her doctor informs her that her condition is treatable, but Sydney and her husband, Corey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jose-Rosete/dp/B000H0MN6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jose Rosete</a>), lack the money to pay for treatment. As Corey works longer hours, Sydney strikes up a friendship with single mother Jane (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-Owens/dp/B000PKG6FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel Owens</a>), and the two share intimate (in the sense of personal, not necessarily sexual) thoughts, naturally drawing closer.

There are multiple other elements to the film, including a lesbian-turned-evangelical-Christian who tries to prevent Sydney and Jane from forming a relationship, Sydney's efforts to sell a screenplay, Corey's rage, and, of course, the cancer itself. Too many elements pull the film in too many directions, and few of these elements receive satisfactorily in-depth treatment. Worse, they distract from the fundamental issue of Sydney's deteriorating relationship with her husband and son. Other flaws include the frequently too-loud background music, the at times over-the-top acting, and the script itself.

There are some good aspects to the film. Sydney's and Jane's relationship seems genuine, for instance, and the two leads are generally good. Also, this is an independent film (made in three weeks, according to the film's Web site), so some leeway, especially on technical matters, is in order. (And, of course, it's hardly as if big-budget films are without errors. Think of all the errors in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>, for example, but that film seemed to do fairly well at the box office.) Still, though, I'd recommend ""Desert Hearts"" or ""Lianna"" for better treatment of similar themes. 2.5 stars.",1244419200,36,2817,7.377976190476191
3788192,1,B001T6OPB4,"The other one-star review by E. Hendrix sums up my thoughts on this film, I would only differ in the use(even loosely)of the term film. As I stated in my comment of E. Hendricx's review, I'm not sure what the four-star reviewer was watching but it couldn't have been this piece of bad acting, editing, directing and writing that this DVD represents.",1243296000,6,349,4.645161290322581

3788194,1,B001T6OPB4,"Spoiler alert:  The attempt to weave religion into this script was just pathetic.  If the best case that the crazy lesbian neighbor could manage for their beliefs is that God wants them to suffer and have miserable lives ... well that's no God I would ever follow.  Straight spouse network quote at the end...because these women were married to men.  You know what, maybe 18-35% of people that leave their spouse for someone of the same sex are in fact BISEXUAL who fall in love after their marriages fail.

Why is this woman harassed by her spouse?  By the lesbian neighbor? Why is their healthcare coverage such crap that they can't get the meds they need?

Pretty telling that dying from lack of meds was more important to the woman than staying with him.  So blame the death on the person she loved?",1500681600,,803,4.566433566433567
3788195,1,B001T6OPB4,"How on earth did this project ever get funded?  I've seen a lot of movies with this basic plot and every one was far better than this amateurish attempt. Everything that could be wrong in a movie is on display here; crappy script, implausible plot line, bad acting, terrible videography (sort of looked like a porn flick without the porn) and it was waaaay too long. Don't waste your time on this one. Rather, watch ""Desert Hearts"" or even ""Claire of the Moon"" (which, while painful and embarrassing at times, is at least pretty erotic).",1500163200,,537,4.652631578947369
3788196,4,B001T6OPB4,"Much has been written about this story, so here is why you need to watch it: (1) The love story between Ms. Owens and Ms. Benner is touching, sexy, and warms the heart;  (2) Scenic Arizona; (3) Jose Rosete's outstanding portrayal of a former Marine turned struggling private investigator; (4) Some of the dialogue is snappy and fun.  Unfortunately I could see the ending coming a mile away when Benner whispers to Owens, ""I haven't been taking my meds"" after Owens notices Brenner's hand shaking again. One just knew something was not going to end well. Another thing is that the thought of a strong, athletic woman in her prime who finds true love would forgo taking one pill per day to end her life is not only unbelievable, but ruins the strength of Benner's character. Benner's alleged ""internal conflict"" with religion/spirituality and being a lesbian was also not believable. I would have removed all of the religious parts of the story and replaced it with something more interesting and suspenseful. Still a very enjoyable film.",1499472000,3,1036,4.880681818181818
3788197,5,B001T6OPB4,"this movie is about a couple  that met while they were both in the marines

and took the time to bring her back to life and call the ambulance and she ended up in the hospital
later she finds out whats wrong ,and how much it will cost to get better and live a normal life

there a couple of short nudity scenes but it fits the movie and there is a lot of religion brought into this movie, (why?)

3788198,2,B001T6OPB4,"There were a few rare moments of loveliness between the two women. But those achingly brief scenes were overshadowed by a confusing script and distracting, annoying side characters. An additional  thorn was loud music that seemed better suited to a thriller movie.

3788199,3,B001T6OPB4,"Well, this is an odd one. The visual quality is very low, the acting ... well the women and children are decent TV movie actors, everyone else is iffy. The description is not what I would use. I would say ailing, young, married, writer meets someone else and questions her marriage while struggling to succeed and survive. This is a romance, this dos have a husband character, he's not a terrible guy but he has a temper and he doesn't pay attention to her as well as she would like. I kept wondering if it was like a lifetime movie or something someone made to show in schools or at support meetings for Cristian Lesbians or their spouses? Or children? But there's a sort of ex scene or two and that made me wonder what this was made for specifically because can they show nipples on TV and there isn't much point if its not for entertainment... I rally didn't hate a bug chunk of it but it was long and it jumped round to random places and I hated the ending a lot. I super liked the blond woman Jane though, she's pretty and funny and smart and a good mother to her children. A lot of this was very believable because the characters had back stories and but they were a little cheese. And there was a lot of someone is saying things wit drama now everyone listen... they di have chemistry though... I think the ending is supposed to be mysterious? Anyway if you have two hours to kill and want to watch this mysterious random made for TV? Movie about a woman who when faced with - if this is your last chance at happiness shouldn't you want it? Or something like that... then this s for you... it was interesting, like I can really see where they were going when it was written but they didn't quite get there.",1495843200,,1713,4.290123456790123

3788201,4,B001T6OPB4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I was expecting a cheesy Lifetime movie with lots of girl on girl action.  Instead I enjoyed a movie that thoughtfully explored themes of spirituality, marrying young, male/female roles in marriage, and depression.

Sydney, the main character, struggles in a troubled marriage.  She finds solace and sexual fulfillment with her neighbor Jane.  Naturally this sends her ex-Marine husband into a fit of rage.  But wait, it's not that simple...

What I like about this movie is that it isn't blatantly ""woman good / man bad-guy,"" but rather allows the viewer to see things from both perspectives.  I thought the love scenes between Sydney and Jane were done tastefully.  I'm not sure where they were going with the political statement at the end of the movie, but who knows?  The music was good, the acting was decent, and the cast of characters even included an angry, chain smoking, Christian ex-lesbian.  Definitely not boring!

3788202,1,B001T6OPB4,"I've seen my share of poorly made films but never have I've seen one with every line poorly written.  Forget about everything else negative about this film except that the poor directing and horrible script in combination made for something I've never experienced before; outright concern for the filmmaker and their well-being.  Hopefully this film wasn't too true because the screenwriter in the movie certainly did not pen the script for this movie, otherwise she may really have committed suicide.  In that case the husband should have never received the life insurance check for $100,000 but that's another story.  Fun Suggestion:  Watch the movie, drink some shots of tequila, and pick out the 5 top problems with every single scene in the movie.  Then share your favorites with each other after the viewing.

Why would you agree to go to church with this nut.  She just randomly appears out of nowhere and provides relationship advice to two people who don't know her and didn't ask.  Is she the conscience of the movie?  I found myself laughing every time she was in a scene.  The soundtrack was out of a horror movie, not really a mood setter.  The crazy husband, who literally looked like he was going to climb a tower with a rifle. in every scene.  He meets the neighbor and looks at her like she stole his wallet.  The scenes were all over the map.  It was disjointed.  The only thing that was descent- the women.  They could act, not emmy winning, but they held their own.  When they were making love I kept wondering where the children were the entire time. The women leave them playing in the living room to adjourn to the bedroom.  They made a big deal out of one child almost walking in on them kissing, but were fine with them possibly walking in on mommies having sex.  Next scene they are waking up in the morning, I guess the kids just fell asleep on the floor in the living room. I couldn't finish it.  I can't believe the time I wasted.  The only good thing, I didn't have to rent it.  Prime

The characters do not develop. They bounce from one spot to the next and it leaves you thinking, ""something is missing"" and/or ""what happened."" It could be a great movie if ore time was given for the characters to develop. It was too much jammed packed into it and the actresses did not portray what their lines say they felt at points in the movie. When you fall for someone and all you can think is how much you want to kiss them, it's something that you can not hide. This was not at all portrayed in the movie and it left me looking for that one point where ""they fell in love.""

It didn't make sense to me,  the plot I mean.  There shouldn't have been the ""hint"" about that last apple at the end.  It seemed that it was added at last minute of production. It was more confusing than realistic,  if she was truly as happy as the movie indicated she was. There's more I'd like to say, but,  who's reading all this any way?

The director,producers, crews and casts might have a hard time filming it but they all pulled off  this movie . I like Jane and Sydney, Jane's faith of waiting for Sydney to fall in love with her naturally, after saving her life in the beginning of the movie, doing CPR on her while she lied flat in the middle of the street; knowing after she went to the doctor and found out she has a cancer, treatable if taken care early. Sydney's financial support  lacks that full and complete treatment and just take medication instead. Running on empty dreams for Sydney, because she graduated in Yale University- Bachelor of Arts. A brilliant screen play writer, never get to use it because her husband never believe on her talent- and just end up as normal housewife. Feel sorry for her. Then found a new love to Jane who was her savior; Sydney was given a second chance to find true happiness. This is a movie to watch, its just different from other movies. Do not focus on like a lesbian movie, watch it like you are seeing in a true to life story and feel you are one of their friend. I recommend this to anyone.

I've read other reviews of this movie and disagree that the leads don't have chemistry.  I think they do and the connection is believable.  Not sure the purpose of 'religious lesbian neighbor'.  Was she trying to convince Sydney not to be with a woman?  That whole storyline made no sense.  Sydney wasn't conflicted due to religion, so that really made no sense.

3788219,1,B001T6OPB4,"I actually believed the reviewer who said this was the worst movie ever made.  But I watched it anyway out of curiosity thinking I'd turn it off after a bit.  Nope.  Too much unintended comedic value, ha ha...  and Kathleen Benner (Sydney, the brunette) wasn't too bad to look at.  This is one to watch with your buds... order pizza and beer, pass around a fattie, and promise the wifey you'll pick up the popcorn y'all throw at the screen.

I don't even know where to begin with how ridiculously bad this was.  Let me count the ways... the script is horrid.  And no claims that this is inspired by a true story can give it an ounce of credibility.  It follows the life of one athletic housewife and mother (Sydney) who is diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  Without health insurance, the family struggles with the cost of her illness and excessive pressure is put on their marital relationship.  She soon bonds with the blond single mom burn victim who moves in next door... and without ANY previous warning, f/f eye contact, or flirtation... and despite ZERO chemistry between them, Sydney suddenly jumps her one night with a sloppy straight girl kiss claiming she's been wanting to do that since they first met.  Awkward!!

And it only gets more awkward from there.  Let me further count the ways... SPOILERS AHEAD:

-- there is nothing remotely lez or even bi about this blonde.  I can almost buy it with the brunette with the right partner but this blonde is as straight as they come

-- blonde neighbor is a burn victim supposedly on disability but all I remember seeing is one fully functioning burnt up arm that looked mostly like a rash or faded scars...

-- brunette has CANCER and is supposedly getting treatments... so why or how is she able to jog throughout the movie????  She never seemed sick outside of fainting once... help me Rad, I ain't no doctor!!!....

-- Sydney's Henry Rollins looking ex-Marine husband is a very sympathetic character and I found myself rooting for him and not the women

-- their two kids exist only for emotional appeal and can't act

-- oh hell, NO ONE in this movie can act... NO ONE!!  It was pretty much like a porn movie without the porn...

-- Everyone is spouting religion... WTF.  This gave the story a really kooky tone.  I don't get the point of this.  Seems out of place and makes all the characters sound retarded...

-- some crotch grabbing butchy looking dyke neighbor repeatedly pops out of nowhere and behaves like some evangelical hobgoblin... or maybe the kooky conscience to their relationship... spouting advice, warnings, and obnoxious born again crapola... HUH?! lol... so random...

-- the musical score was hilariously on too loud, overdramatic, out of place... you name it.  It was off in every way possible

--  the brunette dies in the end... quite pointlessly, I might add

-- ex-Marine's wheelchair bound war buddy pops out of nowhere to save the day, spouting words of wisdom like some scene from Family Guy and disappears just as suddenly.... WTF, lol.... that WAS Joe Swanson (wheelchair guy) from Family Guy, lol...

-- sex scenes include f/f and m/f... and the m/f was more believable!!!

Not the worst movie ever made...  but definitely representative of the hideously bad films that pervade the lez-themed genre.... laughed all the way through!",1414886400,6,3320,4.753064798598949

3788227,2,B001T6OPB4,"Well, this is honestly the first review I have written on here because I don't normally do these things.  I also genuinely believe in being supportive and finding something nice to say.  It had potential, it did.  But they lost me in the beginning... opening scenes fixating on the marine stickers and retired marine stickers on the truck... then the weird scene on the street in the rain... um, really???? that was like wow... not at all realistic from any angle... then the lack of money or insurance...umm...retired military gets a retirement check and medical care people - really... so, I guess my primary advice to the screenwriter is employ fact checking... I could probably never write a screen play or make a movie, so you all did way better than I ever would, but seriously.

Then it just got more weird and choppy and remained unrealistic. I did find some of the marine scenes somewhat believable but then some were just unrealistic and I think the fault with some may have been editing issues.  But I don't know, but I do know when it was over...I was like...wtf was that?  and the christian thing... what?  clearly it wasn't made by right wingers but that was just weird and I think they just maybe wanted a kookie factor in the movie or maybe trying to set up the idea that the alternative the butch was selecting was ridiculous - I don't know, but I wouldn't buy it... watch it for a few bucks to see what we are talking about... I mean there were a few points where I kinda tried to get into it a bit, but mostly it was hard and the relationship with the married couple was stiff - maybe too stiff to believe they ever had a relationship with intimacy...

better than any movie I would write, direct or produce, but not one you will want to watch twice and I do hope they learned a great deal from it and for only 3 weeks if that is true, then I think they did a pretty decent job because that seems awful fast to me...",1368403200,2,1935,4.370473537604457

warning, for those determined to watch... spoilers below....

let's start with...

the script. first, the script is very - very x 1,000 - poorly written. the plot is all over the place, stereotypical characters, and an overall bad message to viewers. to me it seemed homophobic. it's the 'evil/dead lesbian cliche' to the max. [i am SSOOOOOOOO tired of lesbian movies with unhappy/horrible endings.]

that leads me to the actors. first, the actors have no chemistry. second, the acting is heavy handed, clumsy, and unappealing.

last, the soundtrack and directing. first, the soundtrack just does not fit! who did the music for this thing? do they not know how to set a mood? and second, the directing.... all i can say is the director should have avoided this whole thing and run for the hills!

if i were you, i wouldn't waste my money on this so called movie. i didn't even bother to return it. i trashed it. that's how bad it is.

watch something uplifting! try 'imagine me and you.' which is possibly the best lesbian themed movie ever made.",1321401600,10,1224,4.536363636363636
3788231,2,B001T6OPB4,"I saw this film for free, fortunately, which may have influenced my decision to give it two stars. If I had paid good money for it I wouldn't have felt so generous. I wanted to like it, but the crazy quilt storyline made it impossible. You know you have a problem when you stop the movie and back it up to see where you missed any foreshadowing whatsoever for certain dialog (I did this twice). Like another reviewer here, I was surprised when the main character (Sydney) first reveals how she feels toward her neighbor (Jane). I said (out loud, actually), ""Wait a minute. Where did that come from?"" I don't know if it was bad writing or bad editing or both, but after backing the movie up and looking for some inkling, I can safely say it came completely out of left field. This was not the lone example of dialog or plot that made no sense in the context of the film. There was far too much of it, so much I couldn't take the relationship seriously, which detracted quite a bit from the intended emotional effect of the ending (which also made no sense).

The actors seemed to try their best, but all of them overacted, with the exception of Rachel Owens (Jane). She played free spirit, bohemian Jane without all the angst and bizarre emotional outbursts that characterized the rest of the characters. The children were there as props more than anything else. They didn't really react much to what was being said and done, and certainly not as real children would have reacted under the circumstances. I have to chalk up the over the top style of acting to bad direction, since they all seemed to do it.

I found myself feeling bad for poor Corey, Sydney's husband. He suffers from a distinct lack of a sense of humor, but otherwise he seems like a man trying to provide for his family, while his wife nags him constantly about not spending enough time with her. And what was up with that? She wants him to spend more time with her, but when he's with her, she doesn't want him to touch her, and seems bored to tears with him. If I was Kathleen Benner (Rachel) I would get the impression my character was bipolar, not stricken with cancer.

Speaking of the diagnosis, the doctor was almost comically cold and insensitive in revealing the details of her condition to Sydney, as soon as he found out she didn't have any insurance. When she told him, I'm literally going, ""Wait a minute. Isn't Corey a retired Marine? I mean, they made a point of showing us his bumper sticker. (I pay attention to those kind of details, but the writer, director, and producer apparently did not. Hint to them: do a search for military health benefits next time.) Why not take Sydney to a VA hospital? They have one conveniently located in Prescott, AZ. You'd think the doctor would know that, and would also question why Corey has no health benefits, like I did. I stopped taking the script very seriously at that point.

Toss in your stereotypical token butch (the writer attempts to make her less stereotypical by making her a stereotypical born again right-wing Christian), a stereotypical evangelical preacher, and several odd plot points that made no sense (like the scene where a ""good samaritan"" stops and saves Sydney's life with mouth to mouth resuscitation in the pouring rain, and then conveniently and inexplicably disappears, only to reappear later to confuse the viewer).

There was a decent movie hidden in this mess, and some actors who I think could have pulled it off. The problem is, it was too well hidden behind mediocre to bad dialog, bad direction, sloppy editing, and extraneous characters and plot twists. Not worth the two hours.",1318636800,4,3638,4.625386996904025

I bought it on DVD and the love scenes were nice and the actresses were pretty but the whole involvement with the husband - the back and forth drama, it just wasn't convincing.

8340691,4,B001T6OPB4,"I'm giving this a 4 star rating not because it was an outstanding movie, but because the overall theme and main two actresses did a fantastic job! The overall storyline is very good and sweet and realistic. Which I found refreshing and enjoying. It was cheesy at times, and a few of the actors should stop acting, which made parts of the movie a struggle. However, the main actresses were very good and sincere along with the plot which made the cheesiness easy to bare. I look for movies that are realistic to life in the lesbian world, where the actresses are really kissing, passionate scenes, that resonate realism. This movie hit the nail, along with the emotions between the two women and a wonderful explanation as to what a woman can get from another woman that she can't get from a man, speaking from the nonsexual aspect of things. Which many men dwell on and don't realize women are multi-dimensional. This movie tries it's best to show that. Not to mention the lead actresses are both very beautiful, so it makes for a very enjoyful 2hrs! Stick with it though, it's slow moving and the husband is BEYOND irritating!!

The husband literally looked like he was constipated in every scene, and another commenter said it best, so I'll repeat: ""WTF on the ex lesbian lonely I got Jesus from Colorado woman."" She was SO RANDOM. I mean, the whole moral/religious battle could have been a good twist, because I can relate to those issues personally, but it was just a miss in this film because EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM WAS TERRIBLE!!

Ultimately, it was 2 hours too long, and I ended up muting it and reading the captions because the soundtrack was OUTRAGEOUSLY ANNOYING. I don't know who's idea it was to use a pre-made organ sound score in ALMOST EVERY SCENE, but YOU should be FIRED.",1505433600,,1026,4.4866310160427805
