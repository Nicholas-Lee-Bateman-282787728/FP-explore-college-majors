8071448,5,B000A0GYGE,A story which I never new the full account of. This guy was the ULTIMATE Bad A$$.,1430438400,,81,3.823529411764706
8071449,5,B000A0GYGE,Very good documentary.  Must viewing for military and reformation history.,1414627200,,74,6.4
8071450,5,B000A0GYGE,Great documentary about a true Gideon of the Middle Ages!  The computerized animations illustrating the battles were very helpful.  Very important history.  The DVD did a wonderful job giving enough of the history to put Jan Zizka in the context of his time period without losing the viewers with unfamiliar names and places.,1412812800,,325,5.09433962264151
8071451,4,B000A0GYGE,"I never thought I would see a movie in English about Jan Zizka, let alone one that was fairly well done. I can recommend this to anyone who would like to learn about this remarkable historical figure from either a religious (which was the thrust of the first portion of the film - the makers of the film appear to be Protestants) or a military (my primary interest) point of view. This really was a remarkable time in a corner of Europe that, as usual, was too far ahead of its time (just as the 1967 Prague Spring was before the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, for example).

Being half-Czech, I wish the majority of those interviewed could pronounce Jan Zizka correctly (the z's have a diacritical mark above them in Czech, and we do have the same sound in English - should be pronounced like the ""s"" in ""pleasure"" or the ""z"" in ""azure"" - and the sound in French is close to the ""j"" in ""Jacques"" (like my uncle Jacques!) - while ""Jan"" [=John] is pronounced like in Dutch, Danish, Swedish or Norwegian: like ""Yaan"" would be in English), but that is not really important.

The facts are bought out in this documentary in a very appealing way. Although this was filmed over a decade ago (and the computer graphics are thus similarly ""primitive"") I feel that anyone interested in the period leading up to the Renaissance in Europe, particularly those interested in religious, military and, to a lesser degree, economic history, would find this DVD extremely interesting.",1328832000,6,1466,4.6130268199233715
8071452,5,B000A0GYGE,"This is a wonderful documentary about Jan Zizka the leader of the Hussite Revolution.  He led peasants and middle class individuals who revolted against the corrupt Roman Catholic hiearchy after they burned Jan Hus at the stake in the early 1400s.  Since his followers often had no weapons, he improvised and guided them into turning farm implements into war instruments.  He was also the first to arm wagons which some would say were the ""ancestors"" of modern tanks.  His wagon and striking strategy was so unusual for his day that he never lost a single battle even though he was almost always outnumbered. Further, Zizka was blind in one eye when he accepted the generalship position and later was blind in two eyes after an arrow took out his good eye.  Truly an amazing story.",1307577600,3,781,4.7555555555555555
