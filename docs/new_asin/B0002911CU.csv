8026764,1,B0002911CU,"This is an infomercial for a ""makeup institute"", a school for makeup in San Diego. At best, this video may serve as a promotional gift item to be given out for free to prospective students... maybe. Why pay $30 for an infomercial that doesn't even inform much? We get to see a lame demo of one makeup look, not even demonstrated by a recognized makeup professional! The whole thing is about 20 minutes long, has no menus and was burned on a computer, rather than replicated. Very amateurish! What a rip off!",1099440000,31,507,4.521739130434782
