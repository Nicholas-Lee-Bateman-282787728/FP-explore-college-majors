1877003,4,B000092T6H,"if you want a movie that ends happy and positive, this isn't it. but if you want a real story, with great acting, and super cinematography, in a very lovely setting... here it is. both main characters are well portrayed, and the secondary acting is well done too. our british couple (mostly at his insistence) are staying on in India after most of their friends and his military companions have gone home to England. He is content to swager about and recall the good ole days when England ruled in this far away land. She is stuck as the dutiful wife, although she points out, ""what am i to do when you are gone?"" she feels very stranded. They are renting their house from and Indian landlady who hate him, and is enjoying the reversal of role. Of having him somewhat at her mercy, which she constantly points out to her mouse of a husband. (who really seems to like the old duffer.) We know that Trevor is not long for this world, but his ending is still sad and somewhat shocking. You will have to see this movie to see what happens. This is from a Paul Scott story so it ties in a wee bit with the Jewel in the Crown story, which is a must view in its own right.",1127520000,26,1165,4.228699551569507

 Staying On, published 1977, is a quasi sequel to Paul Scott's (1920-78) Raj Quartet (1966-75), often called ""Jewel in the Crown,"" although this strictly speaking is the title of the first Raj-Quartet novel. The time is 1972, 25 years after ""Jewel"" and India gaining its independence from Britain. Unlike ""Jewel"" where the British dominate most scenes, in Staying On there are only two Brits, the Smalleys, an elderly couple whose touching relationship is brilliantly played by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. All the other characters are Indian.

 Although this is a sequel to ""Jewel,"" fans of the latter may be disappointed that there is no tidying up of ""Jewel"" or updating of its characters. In fact, only one ""Jewel"" character is mentioned--Mabel Layton--and only in passing. The real character continuity, of course, is India and its people. Besides the story of the couple's relationship and the lovely scenery of Simla in the Indian Hill country, viewers will be rewarded by some scenes showing the poignant reversal of events for the British--for instance, ""Jewel"" has church scenes where Indians are absent (or nearly so) whereas Staying On has a church scene where the parish and minister are Indian and the only non-Indians present are the Smalleys. Another connection between Staying On and ""Jewel,"" completed in, respectively, 1979 and 1984 by Granada, is that Staying On was filmed first as a test run for the more complicated, 14-part ""Jewel.""",1101772800,39,1470,5.163865546218488
1877005,5,B000092T6H,"This is an excellent rendering of Paul Scott's book Staying on, which is in itself a sequel to the Jewel in the Crown Quartet also writen by Paul Scott and also made into a TV Drama by Granada the same British compny that made the Jewel in the Crown sereis.
Staying on is a double success, it is an excellent rendering inhnto film of the book itself and in acting and dialogue it does not fall below the excellent TV series the Jewel in the Crown.
The story is set in post independent India, COL Tusker Smalley of the British Indian Army decides to stay on after India gains independence. He stays on as COL of his regiment.
Yes these things happened many British officers stayed on in the Indian Army and many British civil servants stayed on also. They were kept on by the Indian Government. The plot is set some 10 years after Independence when Smalley in his late sixties or early seventies is already pensioned off and living in a small cottage.
The film captures all the poignancy of the end of Empire and how it affected the British and Indians on an individual basis and above all it shows that despite claims to the contrary British Rule was not over resented by the Indians. They wanted Independence yes but the British were rather liked.",1051228800,29,1248,4.478070175438597
7988741,4,B000092T6H,"I saw this when it originally aired on television many years ago. It is the story of a colonial British couple who have stayed on in India, long after independence. There is nothing witty or upbeat about their lives. They no longer belong, but attempt to maintain the life they formerly had. The acting is excellent, the story sad. Still, I personally love it. Back in the 1960s, traveling in northern India I met several people and couples who never 'went home' as they had nowhere else to go (at least where they could afford to live out their remains years on small pensions).",1491177600,,579,4.576923076923077
7988742,4,B000092T6H,"Some of the performances may look a little over-the-top, but it may be we've changed or maybe, for instance, we just don't get that when Celia Johnson dances against the beat of the music, it's a metaphor.  We may be cooler now, but we may also be a little insensitive.  This is a poignant story beautifully enacted.  And it tells us we've changed.  Times have changed.  We need to register than in order to give full credit to this fine film.",1472515200,,443,4.419753086419753

7988749,5,B000092T6H,"The Raj Quartet left many of the characters we'd come to know and love in the air.  Without 'Staying On', what became of those people after the closing of the Quartet would never be known, but that is not a worry with this film.  Sarah Layton and the others did survive and move on with their lives, as this film relates.  I'm grateful Paul Scott took the time to write the book on which it is based.
Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson bring their characters to life as well as did those actors and actresses in the 'Jewel in the Crown'.  It is a wonderful film and well worth the watch.
The quality of the picture, being taken, apparently, from original VHS tapes is not up to the usual DVD quality we've become used to.  It is not so bad as to be distracting, however, and is not a show-stopper.  The viewer just should not expect DVD sharpness, because it simply is not there.",1278028800,11,876,4.310975609756097
7988750,3,B000092T6H,"Having never seen The Jewel in the Crown, I cannot compare this production to that one. I will say that we watch a lot and buy a lot of British dramas in our house. I bought this one, watched, it and sold it on Amazon Marketplace. It was not a keeper for us. It was barely watchable, and about as life-affirming as malaria.

Other reviewers have commented on the acting of the leads. I would agree, but that only begs the question of what they could have done with a better script. This one was simultaneously slow and superficial. How'd they pull that off?",1168300800,5,557,4.355769230769231
