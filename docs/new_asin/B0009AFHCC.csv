8172625,1,B0009AFHCC,"the only reason I gave Thunder Alley a one is because I could not watch it. It jumps, skips, and blanks out. I have wrote to the person who sent it to me. They have not written back me, I ask him to make it good, I spent over 20.00 for this tape it is a VHS I hope he will honor this request I look forward to watching this movie and I can not. Very disappointed.",1447891200,,363,3.727272727272727

8172631,2,B0009AFHCC,"Generally,there's no middle ground when it comes to movies about the ups and downs of a rock & roll band;these films are either very good or very bad. Thunder Alley would be in the latter category. It joins other movies like Eddie And The Cruisers(both I and II),Satisfaction and The Light Of Day in that festering dumpster of rock & roll movies that take themselves far too seriously and seem to forget why people enjoy rock & roll in the first place. I mean,where's the fun?In Thunder Alley,the band Magic(and people think ""The Wiggles"" is a stupid name)is an up and coming group who's future is being manipulated by a sleazy local music promoter. The sleazy promoter is so intent on derailing Magic from it's collision course with rock stardom that he gets the band's keyboard player(the man-pretty Scott McGinnis) addicted to drugs and bimbos to the point where the guy kills himself. The promoter has a master plan of taking Magic's lead singer(played by the used-up Leif Garrett) and  inserting him into another local band called Surgical Steel(played by...surprise....local Phoenix metalheads Surgical Steel).The story is told through the eyes of Magic's hotshot guitarist(played by the incredibly bland Roger""Where Is He Now?""Wilson).Now,I've been a part of a local music scene for the better part of the last 25 years(ironically,the Phoenix/Tempe scene from which Surgical Steel sprang)and I don't recall ever hearing of a promoter going through such tremendous lengths to get a band together. I realize that it's just a movie but geez,you gotta draw the line somewhere. I wonder if the guy who wrote the script for Eddie and the Cruisers got his inspiration from Thunder Alley. My suggestion to the curious out there is to avoid this stinker and go watch a good movie about a rock band such as That Thing You Do or The Commitments. I'd even recommend Rockstar over Thunder Alley. I think The Rolling Stones said it best:""it's only rock & roll"".",1181520000,3,1954,4.9573170731707314
8172632,5,B0009AFHCC,I want to buy this movie....  Anyone has a copy please let me know,1165795200,,66,3.7142857142857144
8172633,5,B0009AFHCC,"I was in my mid 20's when this movie came out. I rented this movie several times back then and just loved the music and story line. I am amazed to see several of the actors have gone on to other movie roles.

If you want a movie that triggers memories and emotions of a time when music took real muscians and sparked real emotion, not like the de sensitised music of todays generation, this movie is good for the soul.",1163116800,6,418,4.160493827160494
