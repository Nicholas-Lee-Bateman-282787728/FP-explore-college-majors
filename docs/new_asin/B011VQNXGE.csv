7342481,1,B011VQNXGE,"Full of lies I was a fan in the old days of Gloria Trevi I didn't know any better besides she was representing a young rebellious woman who was strong. But nowadays I would not support anything by these abusers/rapists and demented people/monsters. It's true that the girls were ambitious but that in no way means this whore should deny pimping these minors to that ugly monster so that they earned their food and expenses with sex. I believe Aline's version way more than I trust Gloria. This satanical pervert took advantage of underage girls that looked up to that whore. She claims to have loved that nasty, bad tempered, older pervert with the big gut. The girls will always lie too in order to cover up other lies as well I'm sure of it. We will never get the whole truth about the horrors that happened behind closed doors but honestly what 12 year old would have consensual sex with a 40 year old pig just because she looks up to him for being a talented composer? What girl in her right mind would agree to be a sex slave? That is pretty much the grand picture here. With all those pregnancies and abortions who in their right mind stays sane anyway? These two are both guilty as f&ck. I will never think otherwise. They deserve to go straight to hell.",1445126400,5,1261,4.439655172413793

7342490,4,B011VQNXGE,"The story was desperately sad and haunting. It is a film that is at times funny and at others disgusting; but this is a true story, in as much, as anyone can ascertain 'truth' from girls who were brain washed by a pedophile their entire lives. Yes. This movie and Gloria's trajectory are heart wrenching.

The acting was not amazing but it was quite good. The music, though not original tracks, were performed well reminding me of my teenage years when I used to listen to her music. After watching the movie, several things happened: I needed to read more (Wikipedia had to do as Aline's book is grossly overpriced), and when I listened to her music from that era, I can no longer help but feel so sad for those girls. The lyrics are soul piercing once you understand what the girls were experiencing when Gloria wrote them.

 I found the directing to be quite superb in portraying the psychological state of the girls and the way in which their predator, so effectively, turns them against each other. Against each other, even in adulthood, they remain, sadly.

Absolutely recommend this movie to parents, but please be warned that it may be a bit traumatic. Though it will be well worth it.",1449360000,3,1193,4.613207547169812

7342493,5,B011VQNXGE,"Yes, I am a Gloria fan but my review of this movie is not based on my love for the artist or her music. It is also not based on judgmental thoughts that have nothing to do with the quality of the film like most of the reviews on here.

Based purely on the movie, this is a great film!!! It is not suppose to be a completely biography of Gloria or her life. But simply a story BASED on real events.
As a film this works because the story of how an artist is created is always interesting and Gloria's story is one of a kind. This movie will make you see how a star is born and some of the prices that fame comes with.

The acting is beyond exceptional! The casting was perfect! And you can tell they did a lot of research and took time in casting the right people for the roles. They also took a lot of time finding locations to match the real events and payed attention to small details. They truly did a good job reincarnating some of Gloria's most well known memories.

Overall, the film does a great job as doing what a movie is suppose to do. Take you on a journey. This is Gloria's journey. Anyone that takes the time to view it will be glad they did.",1447372800,3,1156,4.039301310043668
