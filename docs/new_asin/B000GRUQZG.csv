2617291,5,B000GRUQZG,"This movie really made my night.

My friend Abby and I (see her review further down) rented the movie together after her colonscopy and needless to say, she was not in the best frame of mind after having had an unexpected delivery in the rear.  Add to the fact that she suffers from the same paranoid disorder as the lead character in this film and I just knew I was in for quite a night.  She didn't let me down.

We popped some popcorn, hunkered down on the couch (after making sure she took all her meds) and we started the movie.

It was quite obvious that this movie has a high production value, especially for a first-time independent film.  This, of course, was lost on Abby as she was far too busy having an argument with her imaginary ""friend"" - the invisible dancing bear she's named 'Pete.'  She then proceeded to slobber all over the front of her blouse while simultaneously banging her head on my coffee table.  I had to pause the movie because I couldn't even hear the dialog due to the pounding.  She kept uttering the words ""Rolfs is gay!!"" and ""cheating, no-good, unemployed, needled-d**ked LOSER!!"" while spitting into the air, but I couldn't quite comprehend what the inner turmoil was that seemed to be causing her so much anguish, or who this ""Rolfs"" character was.  He sounded like a complete waste of life from her description.  Oh well, let her battle her demons if she had to - I had a movie to watch.

I loved the twists and turns in the movie; just when I thought I'd had it all figured out, another plot twist occurred and had me confused all over again.  It was just as well that Abby had taken to duct taping her legs together at that point because I believe the plot twists would have sent her right over the edge - again.  And I was NOT going to sign her out of the state mental institution - again - by promising to be responsible for her by being her legal guardian.  Been there, done that.  No thanks.

The lead actor, Darren Kendrick, gave a poignant portrayal of the deeply disturbed David Randall.  I'm no stranger to 'deeply disturbed' - as witnessed by Abby's systematic plucking out of her hair during the last half hour of the movie.  When the action really heated up near the end, the half-bald Abby jumped off the couch, threw a colander on her head, and ran out into the back yard to wait for the ""mother ship.""  Once again, all the neighbors were pointing and laughing and I had to think of yet another excuse to explain away the nutcase who'd come out of my apartment like a raging bull.  God, that DOES get old.

After dragging her back into the house, I watched the last 12 minutes of the movie spellbound - unable to take my eyes off the screen, even when I heard a loud crash coming from the bedroom and Abby whimpering.  When the movie ended, I applauded loudly, so glad I'd chosen this particular movie to entertain me that evening.  I went into the bedroom to pull the chest of drawers off Abby and make sure she hadn't broken any more bones.  All clear - nothing broken.

As I dragged her back into the living room, she was spitting mad at me and vowing she'd write the worst movie review EVER for Disoder - simply because I'd allowed her to stay pinned under the bureau in my room for the last 7 riveting minutes of the movie.  Like it was such an inconvenience for her...sheesh.

So, do read her review with a grain of salt.  I understand she had to dictate it to her mother to type as she'd once again had to be restrained after another psychotic 'episode' in the mall.

Hey everyone - rent Disorder.  It's well worth it!!",1161820800,,3580,4.3706505295007565
2617292,4,B000GRUQZG,"DISORDER is a surprisingly effective independent low-budget thriller, with plot twists and turns that make up for some of its holes.

Darren Kendricks gives a good understated performance as David, a recently discharged mental patient who allegedly killed a young couple several years earlier.  David's history also includes the murder of his father by a masked killer who was never caught.

David finds himself falling for the recently widowed waitress who works a his diner and in conflict with her possessive friend who wants to be her boyfriend.  There's a lot of tension in the film and one can almost feel David's hopelessness and fear.  Is he still a killer or is someone else out to make him look like one?

The plot asks you to accept a lot but by the time it reaches its trick ending, I found myself involved and impressed.  Not a classic but worth a look.",1161561600,,866,4.695364238410596
2617293,5,B000GRUQZG,"I am not usually a huge fan of psychological thrillers, but this one is great! Eerie, suspenseful, and, most imporantly, believable. Very well done.",1159920000,,148,5.208333333333333
2617294,5,B000GRUQZG,"I think this was just a great movie. If you love scary movies, this one is a definite buy.  The complex plot kept me wanting more.  Just when I thought I had it figured out.... well, you have to experience it for yourself.

Saw it at a release in NY and can't wait to see it again!",1159747200,,281,3.8947368421052633
2617295,4,B000GRUQZG,"Suprisingly entertaining Giallo-esque modern phsychothriller.  Considering the peanut-size budget and mediocre but willing performances, this manages to hold the attention in this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink twist on the slasher film.  There were more ""surprises"", false endings, and red-herrings that I could probably count; I'm not sure that's a good or bad thing (for me it's a GREAT thing).  I was impressed by the complexity, character archs, score, and presence of mood and some splashes of style here and there.  I enjoyed the film thoroughly, a very nice suprise.  This movie deserves to find an audience!!",1155254400,2,618,5.602150537634409

2617304,5,B000GRUQZG,I was surprised what a good movie this was.  The story kept me interested the entire time and the acting was really good for a low budget film.  Worth watching!,1475452800,,160,4.3

2617306,2,B000GRUQZG,"Ok, It is a slow movie and quite intriguing and I kept thinking to myself that the ""killer"" had to be running through some portals in the woods and everywhere else to disappear that quickly.  It is hard to review this without using spoilers, but I'll do my best....You get twists and hints along the way all throughout the movie on who is truly the ""killer"" and sometimes they're subtle and sometimes they're not.  I am pretty disappointed with the ending actually.  They tried too hard to do something new and it just came out as a wtf cheesy moment.  I just can't even.....that ending.  It was just too unbelievable for an ending, but at least it has a definitive ending.  It's just ok.  I'd say give it a watch, but don't expect the ride of your life through it.  The ending made almost perfect sense and then they just made it hogwash.  I feel played :D",1475193600,5,857,4.407643312101911
2617307,1,B000GRUQZG,"Cheesy, poor acting.. Yuck.. I quit watching it and watched dark places ... Good flick there..",1474588800,,94,4.9375
2617308,1,B000GRUQZG,It was poorly recorded. Not much in the way of acting. It's one that the story itself would have been better suited with a budget. Good try though!,1473984000,,147,4.285714285714286
2617309,2,B000GRUQZG,"I won't attack anyone for their opinion, BUT I am at a loss trying to understand how anyone could rave about this movie.
I found:
>A plot you have seen a dozen times except that it changed slightly in every movie-- here, however, is the encyclopedia of plot variations compiled in one volume, presumably to keep you guessing as to what is happening and generate SOME interest. I got jaded with that quickly.
>Not so very great acting by a bunch of unknowns who admittedly have little experience and maybe tried real hard but it is NOT ENOUGH.  One important description of good acting is whether or not the actor makes you care about the character--good or bad, rooting for him or wanting to see him die, you have been moved.  I found that the only character I cared about was Melissa and that was solely because she was an attractive young woman whose look appealed to me. The actor's native sex appeal is probably not acting.
>A poor script that was just completely maxed out with lame plot twists to create interest the writing could not.
>And finally, a terrible cinematography experience with almost constant pixilation of varying size parts of the screen at 1080p resolution viewed on a high end monitor and video card combo that serves up streaming video very well.  You can go on Steam or some of the other gaming services and download  FREE high rez video games that provide a clearer image at much higher refresh rates.  This copy on Prime is not much superior to crumby 30 year old Youtube bootleg rock concert quality.",1473897600,7,1530,4.630996309963099
2617310,4,B000GRUQZG,Good mystery.  Slow at first but proceeds to a twisted climax.,1473811200,,62,4.636363636363637
2617311,3,B000GRUQZG,Starts off a little slow but many movies do.  It picks up nicely only a little while in and sets a good pace from there. Never stops you guessing. I guessed right and wrong 10 times regarding the plot twists :)  Enjoy!!,1473811200,3,219,4.190476190476191
2617312,5,B000GRUQZG,"I don't usually like thriller/suspense/horror flicks, but I did really enjoy this one.  It wasn't the typical slasher, teenage girl with little clothing, immature kids killing for the sake of killing, or anything even remotely close to that.  This was a cerebral movie where I got into the main character (the story had a great voice).  I delved into his character, his illness, what he was experiencing (or thought he was).

There were a number of flashbacks throughout the movie that really lent a good perspective on the upbringing of David and how he arrived at his present circumstances.  Sometimes flashbacks are detractors, but I believe they were done really well in this movie.

If you enjoy thrillers/horror movies, I would definitely add this one to your collection.  BTW - watch till the end, it'll all make sense, and make you do a double take.",1462233600,2,857,4.86896551724138
2617313,2,B000GRUQZG,"This movie starts with classic suspense. Something goes bump in the night. A stranger in the house? The imperiled protagonist (this time, uncharacteristically, a grown man - not a blonde teenage girl) goes downstairs to do combat with whatever intruder is down there.

The film shows its indie origins with its rather smudgy picture quality and generally low production values. And Darren Kendrick in the lead role is wooden. Again, with all the aspiring actors out there, I wonder why they couldn't have found a better one in the bunch. But then on second thought, since Kendrick's character is supposed to have a history of mental illness, perhaps his lifeless demeanor is appropriate after all.

SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER

My main objection to this film though is its number of twist endings. It piles one on top of the other, until it has lost all credibility.

END OF SPOLIER - END OF SPOILER

However, the movie held my interest (if just barely) most of the way. There are worse thrillers out there to curl up in front of when you want to forget about everything that's going creaky in your own house for an hour or so.",1170892800,,1127,4.671717171717172
2617314,5,B000GRUQZG,"The movie Disorder was exceptional.  It was an edge of your seat thriller with lots of twist and turns that kept you enthralled the entire time.

I recommend this to every suspense-loving movie goer.",1168300800,,199,4.823529411764706
2617315,5,B000GRUQZG,"Gotta say, Disorder rocks.

I should know. I've seen it about 20 times! LOL

However, there are OTHER movies online that people might find of great interest as well. There's one in particular, centering around a character simply called ""Peter R."" that is quite fascinating. This man's tricks with his wife's purple hair brush are not to be BELIEVED. And the shower scene is quite comical if not highly disturbing. It's amazing what people can get up to when they don't work and let their wives support them, isn't it? Belive me, this release is NOT for the squeamish - or the normal.

The funny part is that while the lead actor in Disorder is suffering from a psychological disorder, the star of ""Peter R."" is not. He's simply a deviant. Wonder what disorder THAT falls under?

Oh well. In either event, The Peter R. story is simply a must-see for the Gay Pride community.

Anyway, back to Disorder. Truly a mind-bending film. Get it.",1162684800,,935,4.642424242424243
8134294,4,B000GRUQZG,"I watched this while snowed in at work. plot is slow, story line is choppy and I would have ranked this with many other class B films same old blah blah blah, but I found it rushed to a finish with the zeal of a high school boy who says ""I got mine"" to his prom date in the back seat of his car, but if you watch the whole thing, you will find she got hers too.
