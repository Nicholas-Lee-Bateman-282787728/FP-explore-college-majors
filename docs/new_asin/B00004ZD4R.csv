7928424,1,B00004ZD4R,"Doing research for a  screenplay i  was searching for  information  alien abduction i  came across this  as  a  search result. Basically the program is  cut  and  looped from outdated programs from shows allready shown on t.v.,satellite,and mainly consists  of  5 minutes dedicated to each incident. The productions values are very poor and  the interviews look they were shot  on  a home camcoder. The only new  thing that i discovered was the alleged case of a human being mutillated by  aliens and returned just as in  cow mutillations. Even though the picture looked more like a corpse that had been autopsied and  put in  the freezer and then applied makeup to  make  it  look  authentic. Otherwise  boring,outdated and you can catch better shows on  t.v.",983232000,2,760,4.919354838709677
