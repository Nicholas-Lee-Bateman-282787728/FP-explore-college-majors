7771454,5,B01H0W5RNU,I enjoyed the movie,1475452800,,19,4.0
7771455,5,B01H0W5RNU,I first played the video game on Playstation and then I watched the anime.  It was worth it getting this and watching it again after so many years.  Anyone who's an anime fan needs to get this.,1472601600,4,193,4.1891891891891895
7771456,5,B01H0W5RNU,"You know what this is so I won't give you a boring story about how I love this franchise. Discotek has completely overhauled this release and you can tell a lot of love went into it. This is on par with the magic they worked with Fatal Fury the movie.

So basically it's almost like a bluray transfer, but on a DVD disc. It's only $19.99. A great price for this piece of 90's capcom fighter nostalgia! This is the 4th time I'm buying this anime.... vhs, dvd, umd and now dvd again. Totally worth it!!!",1471305600,4,501,4.21875
7771457,5,B01H0W5RNU,Great old school animation. Definitely can tell fatal fury influenced or vice versa. I believe same artist drew them.,1471132800,,117,5.2105263157894735

8764359,1,B01H0W5RNU,"I grew up with the game darkstalkers and even the darkstalker tv show which this is not apart of, thank the lord. im wanting to  find that show now. Still horrid story and one of the discs failed to load. most lily a bad copy.",1534809600,,226,4.022222222222222
8764360,5,B01H0W5RNU,Wish there was more episodes,1518307200,,28,4.8
8764361,4,B01H0W5RNU,"Fast paced, not always the best crafted as a full story, but fun.",1518048000,,65,4.076923076923077
8764362,5,B01H0W5RNU,This not that watered-down USA cartoon series first off. This is an anime that stays true to the original games. It has a nice dark yet crisp style and the English dub is very well done. I wish this was on Blu-ray but the remastered DVD version looks pretty darn good.,1509235200,,268,4.2745098039215685
8764363,5,B01H0W5RNU,"I love this anime, it is freaking awesome!",1505347200,,42,4.375
8764364,5,B01H0W5RNU,It was a cool movie. I played the game back on ps1. I liked it! This movie telks about each characters back story. Never knew they had. They need to bring this back out for ps4 or xbox. And make it on a level of mortal kombat!!!!!!,1497744000,,231,3.9361702127659575
8764365,5,B01H0W5RNU,great condition; played well.,1493164800,,29,6.5
8764366,4,B01H0W5RNU,"It can't be an instant classic because it's far too short, but what's here is quite good. Most characters only appear in montages, especially at the beginnings or between episodes, and it follows only the main characters of the game. But that's fine. The story that's here, the episodes that are part of the set are solid, with good Japanese voice acting, action, art, and stories. Actually, out of the all the classic fighting-game-inspired animations I've ever seen, this is easily the best. I always liked the premise, of re-imagined monsters fighting it out. Definitely leaves me wishing that they'd put together a full season.",1482278400,2,631,5.019047619047619
8764367,4,B01H0W5RNU,"If you're looking for a compelling story, go look for something else. If you want to feel nostalgic or enjoy fantastic visuals then this is the OVA for you. The story is completely lack luster, watching this for the plot is like reading the twilight for realistic romance. The plot is consistent of being a b-grade Saturday morning cartoon.

However, this OVA is a visual feast for the eyes. There is very high quality animation that was put into this and it shows. Plus the voice acting is for the most part fantastic. If you something pretty to look at to kill time or want background noise while you work, you could do worse. I personally enjoyed this because I'm a sucker for old school animation.",1481068800,2,701,4.563492063492063
8764368,5,B01H0W5RNU,Arrived as described .,1478304000,,22,4.75
