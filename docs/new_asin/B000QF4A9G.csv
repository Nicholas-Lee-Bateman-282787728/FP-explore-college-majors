This DVD is an overview specific to Washington's military life as a British colonial and later as the General of the Continental Army. It is well done and very interesting.

 I was originally skeptical because I've seen some programming from the History Channel where the politics of the program creator, presenter seemed to me to be front and center in slanderous and misinforming ways. Most recently, I watched the ""founding fathers"" and ""founding brothers"" History Channel DVDs. Do not waste your time on those. I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production. Seriously biased against small government Jefferson and Madison and drooooling over big government, American Monarchy advocating Hamilton. Garbage.",1307059200,4,987,5.20125786163522

8195973,4,B000QF4A9G,"Although this DVD doesn't break any new ground or delve very deeply into GW's life, they do cover a great deal of ground in a reletively short time. They go over some of GW's youth, particularly his involvement in the French and Indian war. They go over his involvment in the revolution as well. It is most done through dramatic reinactments that are entertaining and enjoyable. THey do have the typical talking head that chime in between and during sequences. I really didn't learn anything new about GW, but nonetheless found the DVD to be a very good refresher course for GW basics. For the GW novice it will be a good way to begin your study of GW. I would definitely recommend this DVD to novice and scholar alike.",1189555200,,719,4.538461538461538
