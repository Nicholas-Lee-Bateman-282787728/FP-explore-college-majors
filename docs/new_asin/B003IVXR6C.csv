8397738,3,B003IVXR6C,"1992. A minor edition in this excellent series in my opinion. Not-so-scenic scenery and just a little bit about a lot of things from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye. Forth Bridge, Perth, glass blowing, Highland games, a distillery, Blair Castle, Inverness, Lock Ness, Caldonian Canal--on and on but with only a moment or less to spare on each subject. The use of two narrators--one male, one female--makes it seem like two films have been spliced into one and it irritates the ear. (Obviously transferred from tape, my DVD copy has an annoying flicker between scenes every now and then.) Sorry to be negative, but that is the way it is.",1280448000,,634,4.7207207207207205
