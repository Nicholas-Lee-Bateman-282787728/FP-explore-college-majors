1879176,5,B0000950ZQ,My partner and I find it very easy to learn the basic steps and would buy more in this series if available.,1142380800,,107,3.909090909090909
1879177,3,B0000950ZQ,"When I first put this dvd in the machine I was shocked to hear Country Rock music being played as the sound track.  I was immediately discouraged about what I had just bought.  The people dancing to the music were't particularly inspiring either.  You wouldn't watch them dancing and say ""wow! I would love to dance like them!""  The dance instructor wore his best pair of jeans for the occasion.  In other words the video is extremely square and low budget and I'm not sure these people have ever actually heard swing music.
On the other hand, the steps are presented well enough and if you have some good swing music to dance to and make an effort not to be as stiff and square as everyone in the video you can learn some moves and get some basic dance steps under your feet.",1080259200,30,776,4.361111111111111

7989403,4,B0000950ZQ,"My husband & I bought this to practice dancing for his son's wedding.  We didn't actually use the steps at the wedding, but the practice got us more comfortable dancing together in general.  The instructions were easy to follow.  It was a good value for the money.",1192838400,,264,4.574468085106383
7989404,3,B0000950ZQ,"I was a bit disappointed in this video. There are better instructional videos on YouTube. The couple, especially the woman, was very dry and unmotivating.  It does get the basics in, but I think there must be something better out there.",1188172800,,236,4.7560975609756095
7989405,2,B0000950ZQ,"I really hate to say it, but I just can't get past the bad production quality. It was obviously filmed in the 80's, and like someone already mentioned what is on the cover is NOT AT ALL indicative of the video itself. It uses cheesy graphics, bad in-camera effects, and sometimes cuts edits while they guy is still talking. It's so dated that in places it is downright comical, even accounting for the fact that it was shot 20ish years ago.

As for the instructors themselves, they seem to know their stuff and are pretty good at explaining things. However they have absolutely no energy so the whole thing just drags.

This may be an okay video for some people since it does explain things very simplistically, but if your looking for something with energy and entertainment value I think I would find another video...",1181865600,4,819,4.641379310344828
7989406,5,B0000950ZQ,"My wife and I were able to improve our swing dancing with the help of the DVD.  There is a lot of instruction which is easy to follow in East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, and Jitterbug.  The comments of the other reviewers all have merit but I was very pleased with my purchase.",1170115200,2,280,4.166666666666667
7989407,3,B0000950ZQ,Several styles of Swing dance including East Coast and West Coast.  Great introduction steps to those dances,1142899200,,108,5.352941176470588
