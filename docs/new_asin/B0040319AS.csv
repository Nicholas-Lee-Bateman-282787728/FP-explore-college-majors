4237850,3,B0040319AS,"Although this film featured decent cinematography and quite a few moments of brilliance, the momentum was repeatedly dragged down by the annoying rivalry between sisters.  Although one does not watch this genre of visual entertainment expecting complex characters and plotlines, the allegiances and intentions of the primary characters kept stalling the proceedings for me.  Having previously enjoyed several totally bizarre and fast-moving Japanese films like Samurai Princess, Vampire Girl Versus Frankenstein Girl, and Tokyo Gore Police, this entry was slightly disappointing.  If the filmmakers had edited the 101-minute length of this movie by eliminating or shortening the scenes that added nothing to the storyline, I feel it would have resulted in a more cohesive and engaging feast for the eyes.  Nonetheless, the occasionally hilarious dialog and the imaginative and clever weaponry implanted in various bodily orifices and protrusions overshadowed the storyline hiccups.  If you do not micro-analyze the intentionally-imperfect visual effects, character inconsistencies, and frequent departures from reality, you will most likely find this movie to be a fun viewing experience!",1279756800,5,1188,5.923976608187134

4237859,4,B0040319AS,"RoboGeisha is a difficult movie to review simply because it's so outlandish as to defy description.  But I'm here so I'll give it a try.

Imagine if Robocop was made by Troma, and Troma was a Japanese company, and that company used the scriptwriter's edition of Mad Libs to develop the working script for their movie - after they'd been drinking.  A lot.  That's kind of RoboGeisha in a nutshell (and the nutshell has been drinking a lot, too).

Don't get me wrong.  RoboGeisha is a wild ride from start to finish.  It has brief moments of almost-normalcy sprinkled hither and yon, but the rest of the time we're gleefully tobogganing down the rabbit hole - while on fire singing Christmas carols.  This is definitely NOT a film to take seriously.  Any attempt to do so could be harmful to your health.

The action is over-the-top/campy and the special effects are quite good considering the subject matter.  Many of RoboGeisha's gimmicks are there more for the 'has-this-ever-been-done-before?' novelty than anything resembling logic.  To their credit, they pull it off.  I lost count of the 'WTF?' moments this movie has.  Again, don't overthink this.

There is moderate gore (very mild compared to Tokyo Gore Police or Machine Girl) and mild sexuality (no nudity but some panty upskirts) in this film.  I don't think there is any swearing.

Overall I give this movie 3.75 stars, rounded up to 4.  The only thing that could have made this movie better is Chuck Norris.",1378857600,2,1470,4.812

4237862,5,B0040319AS,"RoboGeisha has to be seen to be believed. Think of a Japanese Quentin Tarantino on a shoestring budget and you're probably getting close. It's delightfully silly, has some unforgettable visuals, and it's just a fast-paced, bloody, action-packed guilty pleasure. You can watch in the original Japanese audio with soft English subtitles, an English audio track is also provided. The DVD also contains two mini-episodes of GeishaCop.

4237864,2,B0040319AS,"I'm a big fan of Japanese cinema, but mostly the larger productions with A-list actors.  Still, I do sometimes find gory exploitation films like ""The Machine Girl"" and ""Tokyo Gore Police"" to be guilty pleasures.

Now, just in case you who don't know and you stumbled across this, the hallmark of these films are the sexy starlets who are typically either swimsuit idols (like in this film) or adult actresses (like in ""Samurai Princess""), so you can always expect a lot of skin, but even more blood, guts, and gore.  These types of film are almost always direct-to-video and are so low budget, cheesy and over the top that they make Roger Corman flicks look like summer blockbusters.  However, like me, I expect most people viewing this item will know exactly what kind of movie this is (bad acting, scantily clad women, buckets of blood, bad special effects), and still want to watch it.

Unfortunately, despite my knowing what to expect (sort of), I still didn't care for this movie.  Yes, I know it was supposed to be an ""orgy of WTF,"" and it most certainly lives up to that.  This movie is so bat-poop insane and wacky, that you know it's gotta be meant for laughs even if it's wrapped up in severed limbs and shuriken-decorated faces.  Yet despite all that, the humor seemed forced (and corny, even by Japanese standards) and it's just crazy for the sake of being crazy.  If you're thinking of campy, gory fun, like an ""Army of Darkness"" on LSD, this movie is just the acid part (and not in a good way).  I'm sure it's a personal preference, but I prefer edgier, darker movies, like the ones I mentioned earlier.

Ultimately, if you're even looking at this movie, you have an idea of what to expect and will likely know ahead of time whether this type of ""Tokyo shock"" entertainment is your cup of tea.  If you're new to the genre, you might enjoy this, but know that there are better movies out there.  And if you've already seen those movies, you might want to give this one a pass.",1340236800,,1989,4.53781512605042

Everything about this movie is over-the-top, such as the blood and gore, the acting, and the physics-defying action scenes. However, that same over-the-topness is what makes the movie so fun to watch. If you take the movie seriously, you're watching it wrong.

There's only one real extra (some mini episodes connected to the film universe), but good film and sound quality. The sub-titles were fine - readable, but not intrusive. Recommended for people looking for a fun, weird movie on a Saturday night. ^_^",1332201600,2,591,5.092783505154639

So it's a matter of taste, and for folks who enjoy this genre, it is indeed a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. I could also kind of agree with the ""art"" of the movie and direction.

4237870,3,B0040319AS,"This by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.  Odd death scenes, bizarre dialog, a ridiculous plot, and grossness all about.  I really couldn't believe that I hadn't heard of this movie until recently.  I haven't seen any of the other movies that the director had made, even though I was aware that they were gaining cult status.  So I can say there's definitely a crowd out there for these extreme, over the top, gore-fest action films.  I usually don't like overly gory films and have never been a big fan of martial arts moves - but I have to say this movie was just weird enough that I couldn't turn away.

I don't think this is for everyone - by all means, I am 100% confident in that statement.  In fact most people couldn't be a casual viewer of this without enjoying cult or obscure cinema.  I think that the concept of the film and the bad cgi effects, and so on all add to the charm.  But there's probably zero re-watch value in this for me.  I can safely say that people that are familiar enough to know about this film before watching are probably the most likely to enjoy.  For everyone else, rent first and buy (if necessary) later.

I wish I could say more, but this film defies explanation on so many levels that an explanation would go on and on and on... but never truly do justice to the experience of watching Robo Geisha.  So I say watch the trailer; that will definitely lead you in the right direction on your decision making.",1322438400,,1459,4.359259259259259

4237874,3,B0040319AS,"To prepare for my review of RoboGeisha, I wanted to familiarize myself with the director/writer Noboru Iguchi, so I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0016K76V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>&nbsp;first. With that movie under my belt, I felt a little more prepared to watch RoboGeisha.

But only a little.

RoboGeisha advertises itself as ""An orgy of WTF"" and this is probably the most accurate statement I've ever read. Just when you think this movie can't get any stranger, it takes the weirdness factor and turns it up to 38 (11? We're WAYYY past turning up to 11 here). If you're familiar with movies by Troma Entertainment, you'll feel right at home with this one.

One of the common themes in both The Machine Girl and RoboGeisha are their ultraviolent opening sequences. Before we hit the 10 minute mark we see a mechanized geisha girl, two goblins attacking their intended targets with swords, goblin brassieres, and a weapon I can only describe as ""Butt Shurikens"". I'm sure there's a better term, but I couldn't find one in my thesaurus.

PLOT:

This is the story of two sisters, Yoshie and Kikuyakko, who are recruited by the Kageno Steel Manufacturing company. Yoshie is the shy younger sister who constantly gets abused by Kikuyakko.

Once recruited, the sisters start to rise up the ranks of the organization and they earn the right to have their bodies rebuilt. Kikuyakko outfits her body with saw blades and a gatling gun in her chest, whereas Yoshie gets armpit blades, wig napalm and...okay, this sounds a little more insane than I originally intended.

The sisters are transformed into warriors fighting to transform corrupt Japan into the ideal society, by attacking the weak point of rival politicians and power holders...sensuality!

Before this movie is over, I promise you will see shrimp blindness, a Geisha/Tank hybrid, Hell's Breast Milk, a Mecha-Corporation, bleeding buildings, and the deadliest weapon of all: The AssSword!

AUDIO/VIDEO:

RoboGeisha is presented with English and Japanese audio tracks. There are 2 options for captioning in English, but the 2nd option didn't appear to show any subtitles.

EXTRA FEATURES:

(1) Two mini-episodes of GeishaCop, based on the events of the RoboGeisha feature film. I'd recommend watching these AFTER the movie. Clocks in at just under 17 minutes.

(2) The RoboGeisha Trailer, two minutes long.

(3) 8 trailers for other films

MY THOUGHTS:

This is a very niche genre of film and I have to admit, I liked The Machine Girl better than RoboGeisha.

The Machine Girl was a story of revenge in a Kill Bill / Planet Terror style. The plot was fairly straightforward, the action sequences were over the top, and the weaponry was hilarious.

RoboGeisha's plot was all over the place. One minute Yoshie was trying to save her sister, then she wanted to kill her, and she flipped sides several times during the movie. It's possible that Noboru Iguchi was trying to express the love/hate relationship that sisters have, but it got very annoying.

The Machine Girl had buckets upon buckets of blood being sprayed all over the place. RoboGeisha, while having more ridiculous weaponry, didn't have as much of the blood and gore, though we did get to see vomiting robots...

Lastly, the translation of The Machine Girl from Japanese to English was far, FAR superior to RoboGeisha's translation.

At one point in RoboGeisha, a victim of the ""Butt Shurikens"" to the face gave us this dying speech:  ""That's something like this is just...In a sense, it's really unfair""

I think a simple ""Best...death...EVER..."" would have been far more funny. But maybe that's just me.

FINAL VERDICT:

RoboGeisha is a funny movie to laugh at with its over the top weapons and hammy dialogue, but I would recommend The Machine Girl over RoboGeisha.",1309046400,18,3879,5.177884615384615
4237875,3,B0040319AS,"Okay, I a big fan of ICP and the likes, but what a trip. What kind of demented nutcase thinks this kind of bizarro stuff up?

I always thought that Godzilla movies were cheesy, but now I have a different take on a seriously deranged culture.

Although this is not my cup o tea, I do realize there are more folks, worse off than myself, who can truly appreciate this imaginary chaos.

If you like a gaffe of nothing but bizarro gore special effects and no real story plot... you'll more than likely need a bag of purple sticky stuff to enjoy this movie.",1308700800,,552,4.288461538461538
4237876,1,B0040319AS,"Here goes for the third time of me trying to review this movie.

This is one messed up movie. My daughter is an avid anime watcher and as well as drawing her own and making shorts, she too was struck by this movie, and not in a good way. I am not sure what I could add that my fellow reviewers have not already said, but this is one extremely violent for the sake of violence move. Just when you think the characters have reached the pinnacle of screwed up, they break that glass ceiling and get worse.

If you are into pure violence, gore and blood just for the sake of the gore, this is the movie you want. If you are sane, you will no longer be after watching this crude.",1308614400,2,674,4.06015037593985
4237877,2,B0040319AS,Yes.  The subject is correct.  There is acid for breast milk in this film.  This Japanese movie is one of the craziest things I've ever watched.  It is about a band of female assassins that recruit geisha.  They are on a mission to clean up Japan.  There are robots and crazy fight scenes.  This film is so surreal that you will enjoy it for the strangeness - but I'm not sure you will care for much else.  There are sub-titles.,1303430400,,428,4.2625

4237880,2,B0040319AS,"I grew up with Japanese anime such as Robotech, Dragon Ball Z, and Sailor Moon, so I was used to the awkwardness that is the Japanese culture portrayed in their own popular media.  I watched Misa: The Dark Angel and grit my teeth the whole time, saw the original Grudge and Audition films and took them in with a grain of salt.  Japanese culture film can be very alien to the unaware audience and I think I've figured them out.

That said, I only have one thing to say about RoboGeisha...

WTF IS THIS CRAP?!?!

Granted the film was not made to be good but to be nothing but fanboy service to whatever audience it is aimed at, but there comes a point where the film just soars into absurdity and doesn't come down.  Even the Rick Astley music video of ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" was soo bad that it was awesome, but this is ridiculous.

It's a classic tale of weapon made by a group, gains awareness, and then rebels against said group.  Aside from Soldier, Universal Soldier, Robocop, i Robot, Final Fantasy VII, Terminator 2, Terminator Salvation, Short Circuit, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this kind of story has NEVER been done!  The plot holes are a'plenty and the gore isn't even that good... since there really isn't any.  I just couldn't take this film seriously and barely trudged through it while writing a review on Goldeneye for the Nintendo Wii... something I enjoyed FAR more than this film.",1295395200,,1433,4.5625
4237881,4,B0040319AS,"This was my first foray into the world of Japanese B-Movie action gore... and it was hilarious.  In looking at the DVD cover, I got a really good idea of what I was in for (robot castle, weird masks, ridiculous weapons) and I set my expectations there.  I was looking forward to hilariously bad special effects and funny overacting - I was not disappointed.

It actually has a half decent story - it's totally ludicrous and filled with massive holes, but at the very least, I was interested to see how everything would end.  The main characters were cute, even as robots and I particularly loved the elderly actors getting into their blood-stained roles.

The point is that everything is a joke - the weapons make no sense, the organizations make no sense, the character development barely makes sense - but that's what makes it so funny.

I laughed out loud numerous times because I just never expected to see what I ended up seeing or hear such corny lines.

The DVD set is really nice for the film - you get a beautifully colored DVD sleeve and a solid DVD case.  There are Japanese with English Subs and English Dub options - I watched in Japanese for the full effect.

I've since heard that Tokyo Gore Police, Machine Girl and Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl are considered better examples of this particular genre so I have to say RoboGeisha was a perfect entry into this world for me.  I would never have expected to have a desire to see any of those other titles were it not for this particular cheesy blood fest of awesome.",1294185600,2,1535,4.528985507246377
4237882,2,B0040319AS,"I'll be honest, I sat through the hour and a half mess that was RoboGeisha and I'm still not 100% sure what the movie was about. There's a lot of blood and violence but there's not a lot of sense to it all.

I like movies that try really hard to be serious and fail miserably. Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Room come to mind as movies that worked because they were disastrous. RoboGeisha on the other hand doesn't even look like it tried to be serious. It was a joke from the start, plain and simple.

RoboGeisha will have its appeal to some. Some people enjoy the over the top action and lack of apparent plot. Crank and Shoot Em Up come to mind. But RoboGeisha lacks the fun that I found in either of those movies. Unless you're really into Japanese B movies, there's not much appeal to this movie.",1293926400,,802,4.201298701298701
4237883,1,B0040319AS,"In my defense, this movie should be right up my alley. I love cheesey B-movies, I love raunchy blood and gore and cheap special effects. I love hanging out with friends and making fun of movies with ridiculous plots. But I also hate Robo Geisha, and the other works from this film crew (including Tokyo Gore Police and Machine Girl).

It's the same problem that I have with Troma films. A lot of people are trying really hard to make a ""so bad it's good"" kind of guilty pleasure movie, and they miss the point entirely. Bad movies are fun because they're supposed to be good. Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme don't set out trying to make a bad movie, they put their heart into it and the final product winds up being a joke despite everyone's best efforts. That's where the fun stuff is.

There's just no love in Robo Geisha, and everything is an exercise in excess and attempts to gross out the audience. When a character gets an arm sliced off, it's entirely predictable that there's going to be a high pressure stream of blood. If you know this film crew, you know they're going to literally spray the blood right into the camera and cover the lens. The character's going to scream and scream, and the scene's going to drag on for far longer than it needs to. If this was a real scene, in a Hollywood blockbuster, I might be rolling on the floor laughing- how could anyone put that in a movie? But here, it's just par for the course. You show up at grandma's house for Halloween, you expect some cotton cobwebs and rubber bats. You watch Robo Geisha, you expect people to scream at each other and lose limbs. Ho-hum.

Robo Geisha doesn't feel like a satire on the genres it represents, it feels like a knock-off. Robo Geisha doesn't have the smart humor a satire needs, the truly awful script just drags. This movie (and those like it) feels less like an homage, and more like a bunch of talentless filmmakers trying to pass off their ridiculous work as an ""avant-garde"". I am not amused.",1292803200,,1998,4.453551912568306
4237884,3,B0040319AS,"I was quite looking forward to this slice of crazed Japanese trashsploitation, especially after thoroughly enjoying The Machine Girl, a previous effort by the same team. That movie perfectly balanced over-the-top violence, laughs and fan service with a story that just about held it all together. It's become, like the English language movie Crank, a favourite piece of cinematic junk food.

The trailers made Robogeisha appear like it might be a contender for that exalted list of guilty pleasures. While there are plenty of laughs to be had during the running time of this film, and ideas crazier than a sack full of squirrels, it lacks that X-factor which would raise it above the level of dozens of other cheap, trashy movies aspiring to the cult classic status of The Evil Dead II.

Nonetheless, this will pass the time if you're an afficionado of this type of thing. I don't think it's worthy of a repeat viewing, but I don't begrudge the time I spent watching it.

4237885,3,B0040319AS,"RoboGeisha is an odd film; it's silly as all get-out, a bit crude at times, and the plot doesn't seem to be consistent. On the other hand, how can I not have a soft spot for a castle that turns into a giant killer robot? I suppose that scantily-clad android geisha assassins could be distracting to the victims, but really, if you are going to watch this, you should throw rationality out the window for a while.

It's a bit like live-action anime, and there is a plot in between all of the fight scenes. I do think that Ursula Andress had a better double-barrel brassiere gun (in The Tenth Victim), but the RoboGeishas appeared to have more firepower, if less majestic carriage on which to bear it.

If you don't like campy, outrageous movies with killer robots, forget about this one. If you do, you might give it a try; serve with plenty of popcorn, and be prepared to sweep up afterward when your friends throw it at the screen. Have fun!",1292371200,3,942,4.4393063583815024

My Zombie Mermaid</a>. So of course I thought I'd enjoy this too. Unfortunately this movie was so bad I was barely able to get through it. Considering my usual love of weird Japanese films, that should be an indication of how bad this is.

I should start by clarifying the acting, fight sequences and ""special effects"" are all pretty bad compared to the other movies I named. It's almost like Iguchi Noburu couldn't get enough money scrounged up for his usual level of ""so bad, it's good"" quality and instead we just got ""so bad, it's bad."" As well, the plot is pretty terrible compared to Iguchi-san's usual work. Here we have two sisters that are turned into cyborg assassins, but instead of the usual tongue in cheek sense of humour where the actors and directors are winking to the viewers, we just get an equivalent of cyberpunk fart jokes and genital humour. Again, normally I'm fine with that as sometimes ""Football to the groin!"" is all you need after a long hard day. But Robogeisha just fails on every level that it was hard for me to believe it was done by the same team that did Machine Girl and Tokyo Gore Police.

Honestly, if you want to invest in cinematic insanity, gore for Iguchi's previous films. I'd also heartily recommend the aforementioned Executive Koala as it's one of the weirdest things you'll ever see. Robogeisha however is lackluster and devoid of the heart and charm of Iguchi's previous films. Just stay away and go for something better.",1291939200,5,2495,6.818181818181818

It is so incredibly absurd and dumb and you will laugh your butt off.  Basically think Anime/parody brought to life.  Its features every anime/manga cliche as well as other Japanese favorites like giant walking Robot buildings.  YOu want a movie you can get some geeky friends together with over a few beers and make fun of, this is the movie for you.",1290038400,,616,4.455357142857143
4237895,3,B0040319AS,"Perhaps that is why Noboru Iguchi decided to largely dispense with one here.  The result?  Stunning visuals, disturbing images, astonishing ideas, able performances, and twisted jokes are combined in such a way as to make almost no sense.

The film begins in media res as a corrupt, sleazy politician feeling up his geisha suddenly faces an assassination attempt by a pair of girls dressed as goblins armed with swords and butt shurikens (Don't ask!) and a robot geisha with a buzzsaw mouth.  His life is finally saved by the arrival of Yoshie Kasuga as the cyborg RoboGeisha who defeats the robot geisha after a spectacular (and ridiculous) fight.  Unfortunately, as you will realize after you finish watching the whole movie, this great opening scene cannot fit anywhere into the movie's timeline.

This is only the first of the obvious mistakes.

As near as I can decipher it, here is what follows: the movie then flashes back to Yoshie's unpleasant life as the abused servant of her geisha older sister Kikue.  Their conflict grows worse when Yoshie catches the attention of Hikaru Kageno, heir to the Kageno Steel Company fortune, whom Kikue has set her cap for, but things spin completely out of control when the Kagenos, father and son, kidnap both sisters and force them to join their secret army of geisha assassins.  Instead of combining forces to deal with this cockamamie threat, the sisters compete with each other in order to see who can be the most cruel, commit the most spectacular assassinations, all of which pass completely without notice by the government, and who can have the most ludicrous cyborg weaponry installed.  This crazed competition keeps escalating until Yoshie is ordered to assassinate a group of old people who turn out to be the relatives of the girls previously kidnapped by the Kagenos and who are now trying to free them.  Yoshie's eventual decision to join forces with them sets up the climax.

Would that the movie made anything close to this much sense.

Here are the problems as I see them. The villains' plans never make any sense at all, but then neither do the plans of the relatives, and the motives of most of the characters for most of the movie are simply incomprehensible.  For too much of the movie there aren't any characters to like at all, and the acting is disturbingly uneven.  While many of the secondary character actors seem to be deliberately overacting, many of the leads seem to be nailing their melodramatic performances between botching their overly broad comedic performances.  I found the result very disjointed, like several different unrelated movies being intercut together.  As for the parody elements, these varied from brilliantly over the top (Breast machineguns?  Fully automatic apologies?  Transforming geisha?) to just plain sad (Bleeding buildings?  The butt sword?).  I also lost interest in the central question of, ""Does Kikue hate Yoshie or really love her?"" about the time of the first 360.  There were at least a couple more revolutions before the question was finally left unresolved, but I was past caring.

Now, before someone simply dismisses me as an old stick-in-the-mud, let me demonstrate that I am truly a fan of gonzo Asian filmmaking.  For example I enjoyed the movie that no doubt partly inspired this mess,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotrix/dp/B000TIL6IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotrix</a>, which if anything offered even more disturbing contrasting scenes of juvenile humor and sick violence, but never managed to forget the basic plot in the process.  The problem was easily defined, and the characters and the audience all got it and no matter the temporary distraction never forgot it.  Even a more flat out parody like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-on-Delivery/dp/B000LAZDKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love on Delivery</a>, a send up of every martial arts movie convention ever filmed, is far more logically put together than this mess, which appears to have been written DURING a drunken visit to a geisha house after everyone had gotten so smashed they had switched to serving the cheap saki.

Sure, it could have been worse, but it should have been so much better.

Note: One of the DVD extras is ""GeishaCop: Fearsome Geisha Corps -- Go To Hell!"" set in the same RoboGeisha universe but (naturally) incompatible with the plot of the main movie (what a surprise!) that should nevertheless not be viewed until after watching the main feature at least once.  Interestingly, this little short is much more of a straight parody than the main film and yet still possesses a more coherent plot!  It also explains more thoroughly the ""theory"" behind the butt sword for those who might care.",1289952000,,4795,5.238219895287958

But that adds to the fun.  In Japanese but with English subtitles, but really there isn't a lot of dialogue, your watching the action on the screen, and there's a lot of it.

But a steel industry tycoon walks into the door of their house one day (which is never explained) when they are fighting and is impressed by the younger girl, who can rip apart a phone book with her bare hands. If you couldn't work out what happened, don't worry he tells us out loud, she ripped apart a phone book with her hands.  Both sisters are invited to dinner where they are forced to join the tycoon and his father's army of ruthless Geisha assassins who are also more machine than human.
