3821479,5,B001VEJK6Y,"I haven't seen much of the real 'W' since 1/20/09. Watching this one man show by Mr. Ferrell was a complete joy, AND ALSO A SAD reminder of what was done to us...OUR country and the 'W' PALS WHO DID IT TO US.
  I FOUND IT MEZMERIZING, VERY FUNNY and impressive in it's overall presentation. It is so much more than another SNL sketch or parody with funny mannerisms.  Individuals that refuse to recognize the deeper realities and value of this skillfully written and performed show just can't handle the horror that this man and his pals like Rummy, Cheyney, Rove et all were given the keys to our precious democracy and ran amok with power, greed, fear mongoring and bad decisions that we the complacent people must deal with for years to come. We deserve the blame for letting ourselves get uncomfortably numb and not doing our job as citizens! Let us pray and let us STAY involved to never again let their ilk run our country, economy and constitution into the ground!  Take some time and see for yourselves.
  Thank you Will Ferrell!  Extremely WELL DONE!

3821480,5,B001VEJK6Y,"I have to be honest when I first watched it on HBO I was, ""Meh.""  I don't know what was wrong with me or what I was expecting because the next time I saw it I was ROTFL! (No, I wasn't drunk.)  The same thing for the 3rd, 4th and 5th, etc...

This performance gets better each time you see it I think.  You catch all the goofy, sly nuances that way.  I can't wait to own the DVD because I know it's going to make me laugh yet again.  Will, when I heard you were going to be on Broadway with a show about George Bush I though you were nuts.  I'm happy to say you proved me wrong and I will not question you ever again.",1243987200,3,616,3.765625
3821481,5,B001VEJK6Y,"I saw this on Broadway, it was amazing, the fans of Anchorman and the HBO special will love it!! Classic Ferrell with a witty political twist, loved it!!",1243987200,4,153,4.5
3821482,4,B001VEJK6Y,"I'm in 80% agreement with Mr. Frey.  I, too, saw it several times.  Like the movies ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Airplane!"" Ferrell and Company's nuanced performances had to be re-seen to be fully appreciated.  I felt the Condi Rice scene was nothing short of astounding.  The limber lookalike who limned her should win a Tony for Most Athletic Supporting Actress!  Ferrell maintained perfect character consistency and nearly perfect improv toward the play's end.  There were several segments that definitely needed tighter editing, but they did not detract substantively from the quality of the performance as a whole.  To sum up, this play was credible, clever, and for the most part, terrifically funny!",1240790400,4,692,5.236363636363636
3821483,5,B001VEJK6Y,"Reading a couple of bad reviews on this performance, ""Will Ferrell: You're Welcome, America. A Final Night with George W. Bush"", has me baffled. Most folks in this world love most of Will Ferrell's hilarious wit and comedy range. Obviously these other negative reviewers don't have witty & intelligent senses of humor. Even if you don't follow politics, and whatever party you're in or not in if you do, this is HILARIOUS from beginning to end! Just like going to see a live play, they take quick entermissions to change set pieces and ""W""s wardrobe. It is injected with adult content & language as Ferrell nails ""W"" perfectly. He tells farcical little ""W"" life details & stories that will have you crying with laughter! I watched this like 6 times when I had HBO. Ignore any bad reviews on here, those folks are retarded. You must at least rent this when it comes out, you won't be disappointed! It's another masterpiece from Will Ferrell and a classic goodbye to the historical goof that is George W. Bush!",1239321600,38,1008,4.700564971751413
3821484,1,B001VEJK6Y,"Tedious, base yawnfest from the used to be funny, now we wish he'd just retire Will Ferrell. Any footage of the real George Bush is much more amusing but if you want yet more of what youve undoubtedly seen or heard before from just about every possible avenue then knock yourself out.",1238889600,11,284,4.480769230769231
3821485,5,B001VEJK6Y,"The DVD isn't out yet, so I don't know what that will be like, but the program itself is hysterical. I think I've watched it on HBO 6 or 7 times and it still cracks me up. Even a bare bones DVD with no extras would be well worth getting, so there is really nowhere to go but up.",1238457600,21,278,3.7288135593220337

3821488,5,B001VEJK6Y,"If you're a fan of Will Ferrell in general, and presidential humor in particular, then you'll love this offering.  Even if you're not a Will Ferrell fan, his impersonation of President Bush is amazing and hilarious.  Ferrell gives a great performance as the former president.  The subject matter is hilarious, as is his interactions with the audience.  This is a must have for Ferrell fans, as well as fans of political humor.",1483833600,2,426,4.875

3821520,2,B001VEJK6Y,"Yawn.  There were some funny moments, but I was tired of watching this after 15 minutes. I watched it to the end, but it was a waste of time. I am no fan of George Bush and there were some good parodies, but Will got a bit vulgar in parts.",1468108800,,239,3.78
3821521,2,B001VEJK6Y,"Could only watch half, it wasn't a impersonation of Bush really, but of extremes that don't remotely resemble the man. Think this exposes more of Will Ferrell's inner being than a satire on a president. This mistake on Ferrell's part wasn't from a lack of material on Bush either. Gives good insight to the interrelation between ideological bias and social hysteria, with stage comedy as the Deus Ex Machine. I didn't see Bush on stage anytime during the entire show, just leftist elitism. If you want to understand why the Libyan War and rise of ISIS happened, watch this show and look at the audience.... it was think-tanks like them who spurred it forward. Behind Will Ferrell's squinting mimick lies a million refugees.... and their justification to ignore their responsibility in the hellish world they created. This is a very terrible film, only gets worst and worst when we realize how much we have lost as a nation, the humanitarian crisis the far left sprung, because of this twisted mindset. This show is a example of how not to do political comedy, it is America at our most twisted. I'm surprise Will didn't punch a live baby for no apparent reason while doing a Bush impression, would of fit the program flawlessly.",1467936000,,1228,4.797169811320755

3821796,5,B001VEJK6Y,"Will Ferrell shines in his portrayal of what he imagined a one-man show by former president George W Bush might look like.
By utilizing members of the live audience on Broadway where this was recorded, Ferrell brilliantly conveys what one could easily imagine 'W.' doing and saying were he afforded such a forum.

Most successful parodies of well-known personalities reveal humorous absurdity simply by using their target's own words and personality; this is what Ferrell does best, capturing a bored former president who is frustrated by what he sees as an unfair judgement by history of his presidency... eager to correct the record with the bluster and ham-handedness only someone as incurious and cocky as Bush would dare attempt.

In the course of conveying a revisionist version of events we all recall as Bush might want us to see them, Farrell's often sympathetic portrayal refuses to let his character off the hook. We know (as he knows we do) just how disastrous his 8-year reign was for this country and the world, and his protestations are as inauthentic as the man he knows himself actually to be.

The unspoken, clear message cloaked by wit and humor allows us to be entertained without doubting for a second that Bush 43 will correctly be remembered as one of the least-able and disastrous leaders this nation has ever known.",1449014400,3,1340,4.920353982300885

This is typical Hollywood ""we think the guy is a boring idiot but we'll cash in on his boring idiocy if we can"" anti-George Bush garbage. George Bush himself proved at several White House Correspondent Dinners that he is funnier than anyone and everyone satirizing him. And smarter, too. There's nothing quite so funny as college dropouts or at best college graduates with drama degrees talking about how ""stupid"" a successful businessman, Yale graduate and Harvard MBA is.

3822107,3,B001VEJK6Y,"It was pretty good but it wasn't his best work. I think Will Ferrell is a better actor than a comedian, but that's just my opinion. He seems a little abrasive at times when he's dealing with the audience, which doesn't come across when he is dialoguing with another actor. Also, since I've been given the pulpit, I'd like to say that it wasn't my first choice, my second choice or my third choice. Like netflix, prime doesn't seem to have the movies I want to watch. It's a little better but still pretty bad. The Godfather? How could you not have one of the best movies of all time? The Big Lebowski? Anchorman? Caddyshack? Animal House? The Blues Brothers? Happy Gilmore? Austin Powers? I could go on and on. 99 out of 100 movies that I want to watch are not streamable.

3822119,3,B001VEJK6Y,"Will did a great job delivering this show with little interruption necessary to prepare between segments.  His George Bush character is good but not the best, somewhat limited by his own physical appearance.  Parts of the show were very funny, but parts denigrated Bush and members of his cabinet with extraneous dirt that never took place for the sake of creating personally debasing humor that was undeserved.  I tried to judge his humor as an independent I am and not wed to party politics and ideologies.  From my perspective, I found much of the show to be way off base and lacking in humor or irony.  Those who hate Bush will probably love this routine, those who thought highly of Bush will not.  Those who appreciate humor and irony will most likely be disappointed.  I would have rated it with 2 stars but Ferrell's delivery elevated it a notch from its base themes.  It's too bad that this show did not take on the benefit of time where Bush could have blamed Obama for the future, even though he has withheld criticism since he left office.  Bush made mistakes but he never blamed Clinton for his mistakes.  Think about the difference in character between Bush and Obama.  Only those who would vilify Bush to exaggeration would use such to elevate Obama in comparison.  It is a shame that we have been reduced to taking sides based upon President's imperfections instead without taking into account the disparity in the difficulty of events during which they had to govern and how aptly they handled their power.",1404691200,,1523,4.7272727272727275

If you ever enjoyed Will Ferrell's impressions of George W. on Saturday Night Live, you must do yourself the favor of watching this bizarre Broadway production. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and the passion with which Ferrell approaches this show is incredible. After embracing the character of George W., he goes on to describe his childhood, and goes all the way through his college years, adulthood, and years as president. He covers a variety of issues, such as the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina (and his supposed infatuation with Condaleeza Rice- that part seems to be an embellishment). What's really impressive is that they manage to make this stage production pretty dynamic, with lots of visual aids, wardrobe changes, and the occasional guest.

His impersonation of George ""Dubya"" Bush is dead on, and when the camera catches him from certain angles, the physical resemblance is terrifying. There are a few slow moments in the show, but most of the performance made me literally LOL. Highlights include a sexy robot dance (does such a thing exist?) between Bush and Condoleezza Rice, a slide show featuring many prominent members of the Bush Administration (Dubya remembers most of them, but not all), and a hilarious bit at the end that features Ferrell doing some improv with the audience.

3822186,5,B001VEJK6Y,"I didn't know Will Ferrell was such a good mimic, but his take on George W. Bush in YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA: A FINAL NIGHT WITH GEORGE W. BUSH is better than any I've seen.  YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA, Ferrell's 2009 one-man Cort Theatre, New York City, show, is preserved here on D.V.D..

If YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA, has a fault, it's what you're expecting from Will Ferrell, one of the funniest people in the world, lampooning the single most-deserving object of ridicule, George W. Bush, is too much for a show running just 90 minutes.  To do justice to Bush's legacy of injustice, the Cort Theatre would have to make YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA into a festival, adding three more stages and having Eddie Murphy, Dana Carvey, and Frank Caliendo impersonate Bush while Ferrell works the fourth stage.

But on its own terms, YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA is very funny.  Also, besides his George W. Bush impression being dead-on, in the final words of the show Will Ferrell gets to the heart of the second-rate second choice of everyone from his father to the voting public, this Fredo Corleone-turned-United States president.

As badly as you did not want the Supreme Court to install George W. Bush in the White House, you will want to see YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA.",1263168000,3,1254,4.836448598130841

He had the mannerisms and voice down to a ""T"", after awhile it almost felt like Bush was actually up on stage telling me his life story. I had to remind myself that it was just Will doing an amazing impression of him for the show. I watched this first on NetFlix because I wasn't sure if I would like it.

3822191,4,B001VEJK6Y,"Will Ferrell stole my heart with his W impression on SNL.  Funny, biting, and ridiculous as the man himself, it was comedic perfection then, and it still is now.

I was not looking for an overhaul of the past 8 years, I did not want to be stuck going through all the mistakes this one man made, whether humorous or not.  I did not want an over politicized evening of hatred with a thin guise of humor.  And I am glad because ""You're Welcome, America"" is none of that.  With completely false anecdotes, actual hilarious quotes, and some of the most traumatizing images I have ever seen on a TV screen, it was nothing I was expecting, but a complete success.  If you have seen Funny or Die, you know how far he can go.

Although I can agree with some that there definitely some ""safe"" parts to his performance, I was happy to see Ferrell reign it in at times (like discussing 9/11 or when discussing the lost soldiers of this current war).  It was nice to see the full range of insanity and respect in one show.

Happily, the over-the-top shenanigans do not end after this program.  The special features are good as well.  W interviews himself (which did seem to run a little long for my taste) and there is a true/false trivia game to play.  All in all, a night well spent with Will Ferrell as George W.

Boldly speaking truth to former power, he becomes one of the first to imitate a politician. His entirely true characterization of this hugely popular man reminds us of darker days long gone. Now that our unemployment is out of the double digits, we are no longer tied up and Iraq and Afghanistan, government spending is under control, special interests are no longer entrenched in Washington and steering the course of our nation, and our children thrive solely on the pure mannah of Hope and Change, we can look back at these ""W"" days with a sigh of relief, knowing that today's politicians are totally on our side and our attention to their actions is not warranted in the least.

3822195,5,B001VEJK6Y,"I don't think there is any middle ground on ""Will Ferrell: You're Welcome, America. A Final Night with George W. Bush.""  If you are Republican or were a Bush supporter, you will probably hate this show, perhaps even finding it offensive as Ferrell does not hold back in the least. If you are like me instead, wherein you hated W from day #1 of his presidency and thought every act he did as President was unexplainable lunacy, then you will love it.  The highlight for me is the part which is potentially the most offensive, a sexual come on and bump and grind between W and Condeleza Rice. Ferrell has been honing his W act to perfection for years and by now he has every nuance of W's movements and voice down.  He looks like him, sounds like him, and pretty much is him ""en flagrante"" for an entire HBO special. This recreates Ferrell's Broadway show on W which was a huge success.  For those of us who never had a chance to get to Broadway for it, HBO brings it to us.

8346180,3,B001VEJK6Y,Will Ferrell does way better when he can interact with others while acting. I do not care for his stand up routine. It had creative elements but the jokes were just not so funny.,1485820800,,178,4.264705882352941
