8059188,5,B0009DWYU2,"This really brings back memories. I couldn't have been more than 4 years old when I watched this show on tv, back when kids shows rocked. Now they are blander than plain oatmeal. But we need a dvd release of all the episodes! These episodes will touch your heart and wish you were a litt'l bit too! lol",1252800000,3,302,4.224137931034483
8059189,5,B0009DWYU2,"I vaguely remembered this show from my childhood during the 1990s. I don't remember if I watched this on Nick Jr., Fox, or other show with cartoons, but did have some recollection that came back to me when I watched the opening theme on Youtube. It brought back one episode about an earthquake. I wanted to find this on video. Sadly, a DVD set has not been released; however, finding the VHS was good enough for me.
The first episode introduces Lillabit's uncle Dr. Snoozeabit who in the English version was a tired, lazy man who liked to sleep in. However, he's a very dedicated doctor who looks out for the village and his niece.
The second episode introduces Helpabit who prides himself on making delicious honey from an old family recipe.
The third episode introduces some wanderbits who like the name describes, wander the land. The village is curious but shuns any wanderbits as unwanted outcasts. However, these wanderbits may be an important link to Lillabit's parents-a very important link. Here we see the kind and innocent openmindedness that the children teach the adults.
All of these episodes brought emotions in me that few movies manage to do. Like the theme says, ""And I know that there's a lesson to be learned. Come watch the Littl' Bits and you will understand."" It showed the power of love, forgiveness, patience, determination, and most importantly to me, the loving and unprejudice heart of a child which we all should look up to. Even though I'm a grown man and gung-ho marine, I still find delight in the nostalgic memories of my childhood regardless of how corny it looks today. They were fun memories that I intend to share with my younger cousins and maybe even children someday. I hope this show is released on DVD soon. If you know who to write to, then please request DVD releases of this and many good shows.",1237248000,3,1840,4.69969040247678
8059190,5,B0009DWYU2,"Tatsunoko Production, one of Japan's most legendary animation studios, is probably best known for classic action/adventure series like SPEED RACER and BATTLE OF THE PLANETS/GATCHAMAN, but they've also done some wonderful work for young children. I grew up on the Bible-based anime series Tatsunoko made with CBN, SUPERBOOK and THE FLYING HOUSE, and also on THE LITTL' BITS, which ran for a number of years in the early 1990s on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block. This series is actually much older than U.S. distributor Saban indicated in the credits - it dates back, in fact, to 1980, when it aired on TV Tokyo in Japan as MORI NO YOKI NA SHOJINTACHI BERUFI TO RIRUBITTO (""Cheerful Little People of the Forest, Belfy and Lillibit""). (So anyone who thinks this was an anime ripoff of the Smurfs is wrong, because the Smurfs actually came later, although the popularity of the Smurfs was no doubt a factor in the decision to bring this show to America.) It was also extremely popular in Europe and in Latin America, but despite Nickelodeon's airing of the series in both the U.S. and the U.K., it doesn't seem to be as well-known in the English-speaking world - evidenced by the fact that this is apparently the only videotape of the series to ever be released in America!
For those who missed this series when it was on Nickelodeon, THE LITTL' BITS is basically a series of one-shot stories about a race of tiny elves who live in Foothill Forest. The two main characters are Williebit and his best friend Lillabit (an orphan who has been raised by her uncle, Dr. Snoozabit, since her infancy). Williebit and Lillabit (known, respectively, as ""Lillibit"" and ""Belfy"" in most non-English versions of the show) have numerous adventures with their friends Snagglebit (the spoiled son of the mayor, and also Williebit's rival for Lillabit's attention), Browniebit, and Chip. Williebit's little sister Teenybit is another recurring character, and often has adventures of her own.  The only real ""serial"" element in this series is a subplot about Lillabit's parents. Dr. Snoozabit has always told her that her parents died shortly after she was born, but early on we get hints that he hasn't told Lillabit the whole truth...
This takes me back to when I was ten, eleven years old, and Nickelodeon was still airing quality animated programming with positive messages and values that didn't double as 22-minute-long toy commercials. THE LITTL' BITS espouses harmony with animals and the preservation of nature; animals are the childrens' playmates and best friends, and the children spend lots of time helping animals in need.  If you're looking for a ""green"" children's anime, you won't find much better than this, and it's less preachy than, say, CAPTAIN PLANET, in its environmental messages. On top of that, the show teaches valuable moral and life lessons, which makes it safe viewing for very young children.
In short, if you can track down a copy of this series, do so.  Children all over the world grew up with the Littl' Bits during the '80s and early '90s, and it's fairly easy to see why.  This series is good, old-fashioned family fun anime, and they really don't make 'em like this anymore.  Bravo Tatsunoko!",1186963200,5,3206,4.918669131238447
