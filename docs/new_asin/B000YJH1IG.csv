8233127,5,B000YJH1IG,"I bought this for my Dad who was a participant in Operation Torch and the Invasion of Southern France. I had found other videos that talked about the North African campaigns but, while well done, they almost always focused on the British side of the battles in North Africa. This DVD has a lot of good information on America's entry into WWII and my Dad really enjoyed the coverage of what had been his war and, as an iowa farm-boy, his entry into WWII as well.",1355961600,,461,4.372093023255814
