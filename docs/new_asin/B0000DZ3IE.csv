1929821,1,B0000DZ3IE,"First things first, let me just say: I LOVE Christmas Vacation. I have it on DVD, and it is not christmas at my house until I've seen it at least 50 times (that's right). In fact, I could quote it until everybody who reads this is green in the face.

But all this movie did was two things: take two hours of my life which I will never get back, and teach me that Cousin Eddie only works as a SUPPORTING CHARACTER. I should have spent last December 22nd watching the christmas lights flicker on and off. At least THAT'S amusing for a couple of seconds.

The movie actually starts off with a couple of laughs. It almost misleads you into thinking this won't be so bad. But right around when they get shipwrecked on the island is when it starts to fall apart like a chinese motorcycle. From there on it is: too long, predictable, not funny, and did I mention it drags on too long? In case I didn't: IT DRAGS ON TOO LONG. We couldn't wait for it to end.

Sorry, I really wanted to like it, but my whole family agreed that it's just lousy. There were barely any chuckles to be had. I still think they should do at least one more Vacation movie, however: STARRING CHEVY CHASE AND BEVERLY D'ANGELO!!!! (well, not if it's gonna be like this one was.) Oh yeah and Randy Quaid SHOULD return in that one as Cousin Eddie, because like I said, he is an EXCELLENT supporting character, but you just can't watch him for two hours.

Avoid this one. Stick with the original.",1098662400,7,1457,4.287272727272727
1929822,1,B0000DZ3IE,"This was, perhaps, the worst cinematic experience of my life.  My family has a tradition of watching ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" every holiday season.  We looked forward to this new edition into the ""Vacation"" series of movies...but wow, did they ever screw things up.  There was not one instance in this ""film"" that I smiled.  Not once.  Quite frankly, there were parts in this film which made me cringe!  Especially the young boy...I've never seen a creepier character in all my life.  Absolutely terrible (I can't say this enough...if only they had a -5 stars, I'd give it that).  Not only did they manage to screw up the character of Cousin Eddie, they almost managed to ruin the Vacation films for me.  Thank goodness I can forget that I ever saw this, and continue to enjoy the original Christmas Vacation.  Don't bother buying this piece of trash...unless you're a glutton for punishment.",1098316800,9,912,4.863636363636363
1929823,3,B0000DZ3IE,This is a fun light movie that you should see if you are a fan of the National Lampoon film series or of the first movie. Some funny parts!,1090972800,3,139,3.8275862068965516
1929824,1,B0000DZ3IE,"I saw this on NBC last December. I didn't watch it with high expectations, nor did I expect it to live up to it's predecessor (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation), but what I was hoping for was something at least remotely amusing which would kill a couple of hours. Needless to say, I was asking for TOO much.

 This movie stinks on so many levels. First of all, aside from the mention of ""Christmas"" three or four times, the average person wouldn't know this was intended to be a ""Christmas"" movie. The family gets stranded on a deserted island (a la Swiss Family Robinson). There's your plot. They try to build a shelter......and fail. They look for food.....and fail. It's definitely nothing more than a big yawn-fest.

 They could've at least made the movie ""look"" real. The scene when the family is on the boat, you could tell the entire sky and water back-drop was blue-screened. There were no shadows what-so-ever. I've never seen anything look so fake.

 The only thing I remotely enjoyed about this was the presence of the original actress who portrayed Audrey in the original ""Vacation"" flick. But then, even her acting abilities were something yet to be desired.

 Now, with all of this being said. I AM going to get this. Call it a completist's curse or whatever. I have to collect my sequels, good or bad. So this will sit and collect dust right next to the far superior, far more enjoyable, and far more satisfying ""Christmas Vacation"" we've come to know and love.

 But if you're not an obsessive collector like myself, I highly suggest you give this a rent before spending your hard earned money purchasing this disgrace of a film. Why this was given the ""National Lampoon"" seal of approval is beyond me. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most definitely would.",1090540800,6,1787,4.662420382165605
1929825,1,B0000DZ3IE,"The original Vacation and Christmas Vacation have to be two of my most favorite movies ever. Why would the network even air this movie?!

1929826,2,B0000DZ3IE,"After all, he does have that steel plate in his head!  Yes, Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase will forever live on as a classic for most of us but knowing that Randy Quaid has the guts to walk around in his skivies was worth viewing this made for television movie.  I watched it, I laughed but we all know that rarely does a sequel compare to the original. Not sure I will reserve a copy of the forthcoming DVD (only because 2010 is a bit of a wait) but I will continue to hold Randy Quaid in the highest of regards for his unique portrayal of cousin Eddie. P.S. I think Snot did a fantastic job of reviving his role..LOL",1072742400,2,623,4.183333333333334
1929827,1,B0000DZ3IE,I really do not know at this point if the National Lampoon's Vacation movie series will ever recover from the HORRIBLE tasteless movie this was. Christmas Vacation 2 or that is what the writer called it is a disgrace it had nothing and I mean nothing to do hardly with Christmas the least they could have done was be someplace where it snows then maybe this film would have worked. Don't these directors and writers get it tropical islands and christmas time just do not blend together well it's like mixing Soda and Beer. The recent movie with Vegas Vacation was a failure but I mean this Christmas Vacation 2 Cousin Eddie's lame adventure really takes the cake of the worst one made yet. Randy Quaid and his wife in the movie Catherine were there and Audrey about 20 years later from the original was in it along with that guy Ed Asner who decided to show up for this geek fest. The plot was not funny the acting was sad and the location stunk! Maybe you get it by now Christmas Vacation 2 stinks! Don't waste your time or your money there is a reason why Chevy Chase was not in this one.,1072137600,2,1090,4.348039215686274

I mean, being stranded on an island for Christmas Vacation with Eddie sounded like a sure laugh fest. Even Snotts the dog was there!  But, unfortunately, it wasn't near as good as I had expected. I blame the director and/or filming technique for the cheesy feel to what should have been a pretty good vid. Once upon a time, while filming 9 to 5, Dolly Parton was told (by the director) that she could not act. In which Dolly replied, ""I know that, but it's YOUR DAMN JOB TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I CAN!! 9 to 5 went on to be a big success. It's a shame Randy didn't tell their director the same.

I was glad to see Randy Quaid, a long-time favorite of mine, but he was given nothing to work with - just garbage.  The original wife of Cousin Eddie was in it.  They did get an Audrey (Clark Griswold's movie daughter from the ""European"" and ""Summer"" vacations, and she looked and acted remarkably like the ""real"" Audrey (the ""real"" Audrey died of kidney disease, I believe).  But no one else from the first movie.  Not saying it was necessary to have been a good movie, but I can't help thinking others may have been asked and looked at the script and, barfing, gave it back.

Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) has been working in a scientific lab as a subject. It's all in the name of research. Eddie plays Tic-Tac-Toe with a chimpanzee. As Professor Doornitz (Fred Willard) discovers the chimpanzee is smarter than Eddie, they fire Eddie and keep the monkey.
 When Eddie goes back for his severance check, the monkey bites him on the butt.
Professor Doornitz doesn't want to be sued so he finds it in the contract that he has to give Eddie a vacation, an all-expense paid vacation to an island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.
  Audrey Griswold (Dana Barron) and Uncle Nick (Ed Asner) come along.

Also in the cast: Sung Hi Lee, Stephen Furst, Beverly Garland.

Beverly Garland played ""Aunt Jessica"". You may remember her from ""My Three Sons"" tv series in 1969-72 and Scarecrow and Mrs. King in 1983-87 and she operated the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn in North Hollywood. This is her final film.

1929953,5,B0000DZ3IE,"Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure is a poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed and abysmally unfunny cash-in  - - and I love it. You really have to see it to believe it. It's just so god awful that you'll howl with delight at the jokes that were clearly written by an 12 year old who has a crayon shoved up his nose, which has impaired his ability to execute even the simplest punchlines. There's hardly anything even Christmas themed in this movie, it's just so darn bad. And it's not even one of those ""so bad that it's good"" situation like The Room or Batman & Robin . It's so bad that it's uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable that it's awkward. It's so awkward, it's hilarious.

1929989,2,B0000DZ3IE,"This is a made for TV spin off with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) from the National Lampoon's Vacation series of movies. There is no Chevy Chase, but instead his character daughter Audrey is here. This movie doesn't feel very Christmas at all. They should have called it Tropical Vacation since the bulk of it is Eddie stuck on an island with his wife, his kid, Audrey from the Vacation series, Uncle Nick (played by Ed Asner) and their Hawaiian guide. The movie throws a lot of jokes at you per minute and nothing is all that funny but it does have its laughable moments. Its still pretty bad and doesn't feel like one of the Vacation movies simply because the family is put into a lot of peril that the original movies strayed away from. There's just not enough gags that appeal to vacations. The acting isn't that good and some of the delivery is stuff. Eddie's family barely feels like they did from the Vacation series. Mainly because in the series they have a lot of kids... while in this series they have one. Sure its explained, but I think it would have been a lot more hilarious to have 6 terrible kids. Everything about this movie felt low budget and that's just sad. I really only watched it because I never knew it existed until now. Take a pass on this movie.",1346544000,,1270,4.431623931623932

It wasn't until I got home that I realized this doesn't include Chevy Chase, but does include an awful plot, and even worse acting. When there's a sequel to a movie, I don't expect it to top the original, but I do expect it to be worth watching. At least I'm only out $5.",1322870400,,444,4.114942528735632

1929992,1,B0000DZ3IE,"So it's almost the holidays (well almost Thanksgiving) and the stores have already begun the holiday decorations and we're on a trip away from home ourselves, which makes us think - time to kick off the holiday season, let's go pick up a copy of Christmas Vacation.  While at the store we find this movie there with the original.  We'd not heard there was a second Christmas Vacation movie and it was cheap.

We learned the hard way - there's a reason we never heard of it and there's a reason it is cheap.  Learn from my mistake.  I think I've given exactly one thing on Amazon 1 star before now.  I try to be an optimist.  I try to buy things I know I'll like at least a bit.  Cheesy or brilliantly smart.  I rate them accordingly.  Something cheesy and tacky can be 5 stars just as easily as something really smart.

This, this a just a disaster.  On any star rating scale rating system - 5, 10?  Whatever, I can't give it over 1, I'm not that generous.

First of all the holiday aspect?  It's not really a holiday movie.  It kind of feels like that is an after thought.

Second of all it's not a comedy, though it surely claims to be.  Two of us watching it, not one laugh.  Well not with it at least.  At how bad it was, maybe, barely.  At how hey wait if they'd done this, will they do this - it'll be cliched and obvious but it'll work, then we can at least laugh... and nope, nope, nope they couldn't even do that.

Okay so there is a smelly dog, so?  They didn't turn it into a real joke.  Okay there is a chick that the old guy and the kid both like to drool over.  Nope not funny.  Their house looks okay but yup falling apart, once they make it to the island we even cut back to it for no real reason other than to show yeah it never got fixed so it got worse.  Not funny.  Well there is a monkey and hey he's smarter than our star.  I like monkeys they're cute.  Yeah, not funny.  Remember in the original movie - the scene with the eggnog, they start wondering if Clark drank too much of it?  Yeah you could drink the whole punch bowl and not find this entertaining.  Pick up the original, Elf, a Christmas episode of your favorite cheesy sitcom, watch a Christmas Story, anything but this.  You'll thank me.

1930010,3,B0000DZ3IE,"Christmas Vacation 2 is nowhere near as classic as the original. But that doesn't mean it's not worth a few laughs. Just switch your brain off and enjoy an afternoon of stupidness.

Cousin Eddie (the ever lovable Randy Quaid) is housesitting for Audrey (the totally sexy Dana Barron) during the Xmas holidays but loses his job at the Nuclear research plant to a chimp. Feeling down about how hopeless he is, Eddie is cheered up when the company offer his family and all expenses paid trip to Hawaii. So off they go (uncle Nick and Audrey too) for their dream Christmas Vacation. Obviously disaster is never too far away.

This movie is basically pointless. The first was about Clark Griswald wishing to give his family the best Xmas ever. This 'un is just an excuse for a string of bad jokes with terrible comic timing. In this regard it's kinda similar to Vegas Vacation, the wit and sentiment of John Hughes is sorely missed.

Quaid does his best, but there is a lot of not funnyness to it. He deserves better material, Matty Simmons may have produced all the other Vacation movies but he hasn't a clue how to write a good script. Christmas Vacation 2 is to the original what Home Alone 4 was to Home Alone.

Plus I have a few questions, which I am sure a lot of other people will be asking. Why does Audrey's plumbing go mental? Why do Eddie's clothes stay impossibly white for the entire film? Why is there an elephant on the island?

Plus there isn't that much of an Xmas feel to it. Sure the scenes in Chicago are quaint and snowy but a Hawaiian Island is hardly the best setting for a festive movie. However, Eddie does whistle and hum enough Xmas tunes to make up for it. But where the hell is the wonderful Christmas Vacation song?

Buy if you're a fan of the first. Rent if you're only curious. It's nice to see a great character such as Cousin Eddie given the center spotlight but I just wish he was given funnier stuff to do.

The DVD is in above average 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with okay Dolby 2.0 surround that is mainly used for general ambience but still sounds fine whenever required. A handful of trailers, a brief featurette and a commentary make up the extras.",1103500800,10,2185,4.474874371859296

 Bottom line- If you are a hard core Vacation fan and a sentimentalist, see this movie. If your not, then don't.  I heard from many people it was really bad, but it didn't matter, I had to see it for myself. And I am not disapointed I did.",1102032000,6,735,4.258992805755396
1930013,5,B0000DZ3IE,"As a great fan of the other Vacation films, I just purchased and watched this film despite reading the mostly negative reviews from other Amazon customers. Frankly, before I viewed the film I was worried that I may have wasted my money. On the contrary, I haven't laughed so much or so loudly for a very long time. I found it to be the funniest film I have seen for ages. I absolutely love Randy Quaid as the hilarious Cousin Eddie and Miriam Flynn is also excellent as his adoring and long-suffering wife Catherine. It was also nice to see the now grown-up and  curvaceous Dana Barron reprising her role from the first Vacation film as the original Audrey Griswold. Ed Asner is great (and very Lou Grant-like) in support as Eddie's grumpy and overly libidinous Uncle Nick. The entire cast is really good, including guest stars in cameos, such as Fred Willard, Beverly Garland and Eric Idle (reprising his role from European Vacation). It is really a very fun, pleasant, upbeat and entertaining film. I also love the original Vacation film and the original Christmas Vacation film. In my opinion, I definitely feel that this film is significantly better however, than both European Vacation and Vegas Vacation. It is nice to see Eddie given a film of his own. I feared that he might not be able to carry the film on his own, but I was wrong. Unfortunately though, the material begins to wear just a little bit thin during the last half-hour or so. Snots the farting Rottweiler is a scream. The film isn't perfect, but I personally feel that it was a most worthwhile purchase and I will definitely be watching it on a regular basis. The filming locations scenery is nice, as well. I thought they did a spendid job, especially considering the budget restrictions being a made for t.v. movie. The so-called professional critics never liked Gilligan's Island or The Brady Bunch, either. But for forty years now, Gilligan's Island has been a staple among television reruns due to it's ongoing popularity among the viewers.

1930015,1,B0000DZ3IE,"My reviews are based on how well a film entertains my chums and me. All other factors; special effects, visual appeal, editing, stunts, and all the rest merely support the entertainment value. What really matters, once all is said and done, is whether the viewer was entertained.

This film sucks like an Electrolux. The vacuum of space does not suck so compellingly as this movie! It is brutally bad!

This film does not entertain. Nor does it come even close. It is a terrible film. It is absolutely awful. Humor, when any glimmer manifests at all, is strained and overdone. The smell of overcooked ham fills the air as actors cope with a horrifically boring script, idiotic dialog, overblown gags, witless peformances and a screenplay evidently written by chimpanzees. Perhaps it would have sparkled had it been written by chimps, because it certainly doesn't as it presently stands.

I purchased the film on the strength of the first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase, which was hilarious. This film was not hilarious, not even funny, not even remotely so. It was lame. More than lame, it was lame to a quantum 10th magnitude.

This is a tragic performance for Randy Quaid, who has talent that is squandered on this tripe without mercy. I also expected much better from Ed Asner, who is simply wretched in this role.

In the past, I have written reviews critical of bad films. This one absolutely surpasses them all for the ""worst film of all time"" nominations! This movie is as useless as a glass-bottomed boat in a sewage pond. As an example, much of the lame humor revolves around a flatulent dog. Funny, perhaps to very small children or patients on Thorazine, but lacking appeal to anybody with an IQ above double digit!

Take it from somebody who wasted 15 bucks on this piece of video trash... DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS WORTHLESS PILE OF STEAMING COMPOST! Do not fritter your hard-earned money. Do not subject yourself, your loved ones nor your friends to this atrocious film. It simply isn't worth it. It isn't fair to them, nor fair to yourself.

We have endured the Griswolds through four different adventures.  Yes, Vegas was pretty bad, but I welcome sin city compared to this.  Randy Quad looks very stressed trying to carry a film by himself.  He's not pretty enough, nor funny enough to be a lead.  Cousin Eddie loses another job, gets a settlement for a Christmas Vacation in the tropics.  Of course, Eddie screws things up and they get stranded on a deserted island.  It really is absurd!

1930017,1,B0000DZ3IE,"I really wanted to like this. I really wanted there to be another fun new chapter in the Vacation series. And this one focused solely on Cousin Eddie and his family. It could of been a blast. Instead, it was a bust. I should have known from the start that a Vacation movie without Chevy Chase, Beverly D' Angelo, and the rest of the Griswald brood, wouldn't measure to much of anything. It was evident from the start that this was a rushed job. It was cheesy, and written and directed as if it were some lame, direct to TV hatchett job. Oh wait. That's right. What is also upsetting is that it was written by Matty Simmons. A guy who was with all the other Vacation films. Matty, surely you know how a good Vacation movie should be!. Randy Quaid is back as everybody's favorite bumbling doofus, Cousin Eddie. Miriam Flynn also returns as his wife Catherine. Seeing the two again, and together, is nice to see. I will give them that. And it's nice that the two actors know that these roles are theirs, and no one else will do. Eddie and the fam are staying with Audrey Griswald(who is played by the original Audrey from the first Vacation, Dana Barron). This is the one good and interesting move the writer gave the film. Eddie loses yet another job and the holidays are fast approaching. There is some ridiculous mumbo jumbo at work and all, and soon Eddie and the clan are off on a tropical island adventure, along with Audrey and his old, curmudgeonly father(Ed Asner). I could of said more about it, but why bother?. It doesn't really matter. The film clunks along like it has nowhere to go and just moves along waiting to get to a point to show off how clumsy and a loser Eddie is. All in the eyes of his little son, who he wants to feel proud of his dad. You can feel sorry for Quaid, but I think he could of known what crap this is. Still, he does Cousin Eddie like he always does, and he is always great. Everyone likes Eddie, and this will be no exception. You just wish there was more to like around him. Asner can be the old curmudgeon, but here he seems to just channel every cliche of that kind of character. If only he could put a little more Lou Grant-zest to the proceedings. Flynn is always endearing and likeable, and she is here. But even she can't hold anything together. The only good thing I liked about this mess, and the only good thing Simmons put in his script, was the return of Audrey. At least he knew one Griswald should be here. But the great part about it was that it was Dana Barron. The original Audrey. This is something I always thought the big screen films should have done. Barron is undeniably cute, and she looks fantastic. You can't believe it has been 20 years or so since the original, and she still looks like a kid. Unbelieveable. All in all, this is a film designed to be overlooked and forgotten very quickly. How very sad for a great character. I have seen Chevy recently, and he looks great. Still looks like Clark. Let's get him back on the screen with a Vacation everyone wants to see. But this one, boy, this one just gets coal in it's stocking.",1099267200,5,3096,4.330464716006885
