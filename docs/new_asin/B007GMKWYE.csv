5085636,4,B007GMKWYE,"What can I say I gave this a try mostly because the GI Joe name as I was a huge fan of the cartoon series growing up.  My first thought was ""It's newer there's no way this is going to be any good, I bet they mess this one up and then some, I guarantee it will not feel like GI Joe one bit.""  Well I came into the first episode not expecting anything good to come out of it but I thought I would give it a shot anyway.  Well I'm glad I did!

The series actually did very well about introducing a familiar yet at the same time different take on the whole GI Joe idea and turned it into a very decent end product.  I would have preferred the older art style to this but it still looks decent regardless.  I like the way they have background story and cameos on many characters from the original series and is kind of a prequel in a sense to the original cartoons.  You'll see how and why certain characters ended up the way they did, this brought some nostalgia factor and was part of what made this a great series.

The ending could've been a little better IMO but it was still satisfying.  In some areas the show tried to be funny but it just couldn't make me laugh more than 2 occasions through the whole series.  Maybe its just not my sense of humor.

Overall the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone who has interest in GI Joe.  Yeah the graphics are a little different, the ending was good but not great, and the jokes were lame but that's really all I have to complain about for the whole series.",1348704000,,1516,4.0673400673400675
5085637,5,B007GMKWYE,"This cartoon series is surprisingly good!  The more and more I watched this; I couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next episodes! I will definetly purchase Gi Joe Renegades: season one, volume two when it comes out!  I think the reason this cartoon was canceled was because it was on the wrong channel (..The Hub; stay tuned this cartoon might be making its triumphant return soon!)! -That is my opinion! Anyways a good cartoon; well written and entertaining!  A very different take on the Gi Joe universe; which is refreshing! The mini Cobra pharmaceuticals commercial in 1st cartoon is hilarious as hell (..all I could think of was Amway)!  Now if Hasbro could of gave us more toy figures from this cartoon like:  Roadblock (..One of thee main characters in this cartoon; and no action figure. Come on Hasbro!),Flint, Lady Jaye, Destro, the Baroness & (..who can forget the ""vehicle"" for those of you who watched this cartoon) the Cobra truck that could shape shift to disguise itself (..Once again Hasbro, you get the ""come on son"" award!  Hasbro you should have produced this vehicle!) that Duke, Roadblock, Tunnel Rat and Scarlet were driving around in this cartoon!  Get this cartoon series if you have an open mind & welcome variety in the Joe universe; don't buy this if you are still stuck on the 80's (..the Sunbow years) cartoons & form fashion as this is not probably for you!  I rate Gi Joe Renegades: season one, volume 1 DVD five out of five stars!  I enjoyed watching this take on Gi Joe!  Oh, someone on this production team had to be a real A-Team fan; you will find out why when you actually watch this entertaining cartoon for yourself!",1339891200,6,1666,4.6552901023890785
5085638,5,B007GMKWYE,I have younger brothers and remember G.I. Joe from back in the day.  This DVD brought back memories and it was so cute to watch my boys enjoy this series.  The characters are traditional G.I. Joe characters and they are trying to expose the COBRA bad guys.  My boys are only 3 and 5 years old and didn't really understand the dialogue but a 7 year old or so would probably love this DVD.  This set includes two discs and a total of 13 episodes.  My boys wanted to watch one after another and I admit I followed the storyline.,1339545600,,525,4.21
5085639,5,B007GMKWYE,"I used to watch the G.I. Joe series when I was a kid (back in the 1980's and loved it. I was the type of person that collected the figurines, had imaginary G.I. Joe Missions with my friends and of course knew the series forwards and backwards. This new series brought a whole new dynamic to the G.I Joe franchise which was great! The artwork in the series was of top quality and the overall writing was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat as I wondered what would happen next. Overall, I would encourage all G.I. Joe fans to check out this first Season as you will not be disappointed!",1336608000,3,593,4.2105263157894735
5085640,4,B007GMKWYE,"I don't make a habit of watching childhood cartoons, but this one wrapped me in. I really loved their reinterpretation of the Joe mythology and how all the characters were introduced.

It was great to see Zartan looking like Zartan again and the exploration of some real struggles soldiers deal with in terms of losing close friends. The live-action movie was clearly made by a director / producers too old to grasp that GI Joe became so popular not just because it was a bunch of fun characters blowing stuff up but because of their unique personalities and dynamics with one another. This series captured that spirit in an interesting new way.

***SPOILER SPOILER***
My only real gripe is how it ended. I thought all the Joe characters we had met in various episodes throughout the series would be called upon for an epic final showdown with Cobra and then Flint would come around and bring them all on board. Instead, the sci-fi took over too much (some is fine) and everyone was just standing there in a big group next to Flint. Weak ending to such an otherwise spot-on series.

GI Joe's starting to remind me a little of Batman with the various incarnations of that mythology ranging from campy to comical to dark.",1334793600,4,1219,4.660465116279069
5085641,4,B007GMKWYE,"I have recently watched the season and as someone who appreciated Larry Hama's writing in the comic series I was initially disappointed in the overall plot and premise. Nearly all of the characters have been reworked, and actually I think the serious would have been better had it not been a Gi Joe series at all (however it would have been odd to have a silent ninja around). That said, once I started watching I was able to disconnect the comics from this alternate GI Joe universe it was quite fun. It is clearly influenced by the Ateam premise of a group of innocent soldiers wanted ""for a crime they didn't commit"", and my son even thought Roadblock was Mr T. But we like the Ateam, so that wasn't an issue. It is a little bland, though. Im not exactly sure how to put it, but it just seems a bit gray emotionally. Worth watching though.",1334707200,2,842,4.403846153846154
5085642,3,B007GMKWYE,"I'm an avid fan of the original animated show (and its DIC follow up) and the Marvel comics of the 80s, the former of which being sometimes silly but always charming adventure (often sci-fi) stories and the latter a gritty action serial. The recent movie is what is, for better or worse, and perhaps it's most significant flaws (of which there are legion) are it panders with plot, misfires with characterization, and is too focused towards very small children and really, really stupid people.

Renegades is a very solid reimagining of the GI Joe mythos that does an excellent job of delivering well paced action plots and characters with very distinctive and memorable personalities.  Much like Transformers Prime and the current series of Thundercats, it doesn't literally connect to what came before, but draws from it respectfully while at the same time diverges in smart and new ways to make it fresh and relevant.

My one issue with the series is the animation style - specifically, the character model design. The action boarding and acting is very sharp, but the look of the show doesn't sit well with me. Equivocally, you can call it ""stylized,"" but I think it's just cheap and simplistic for the sake of making the animation process quicker and less costly.

Bottom line: well done show, but looks a little sloppy. I'm on the fence, leaning towards ""not buy.""",1334275200,5,1370,4.866952789699571
5085643,5,B007GMKWYE,"The pilot episode of this series pretty much lets you know to throw out all you know about previous incarnations of the Joes.  This series is brilliant because it doesn't rely on an exponential amount of characters to tell a well executed story.  Each episode contributes to a rich arch of whitty and sci-fi reality driven story.  This shoe is more of a marriage between the 80s series and the live action movie.  I feel that it takes the best of both and tells a better story all together.  A great example is the explanation of how Zartan can become so many different people so easily.  In the original series he just had a gift for it.  In the movie he received injections of nanomites.  This series explains Zartan's abilities the most sensibly.  I firmly recommend this if you're a fan of the original show or just G.I.Joe in general.  It's not as dark as G.I.Joe Resolute, but definitely among the best reboots of 80s cartoons if not THE best.",1334188800,16,949,4.529411764705882
5085644,2,B007GMKWYE,"When I heard a new G.I. Joe series was coming, I was thrilled.  I really liked the classic show & knew this one would be better animated, more realistic but just as fun.

Well, I was partially right.

I'm not sure what the problem with the series is exactly.  Is it the bland animation? Is it the lack of the classic designs?  Is it the fact that these bland characters are nothing like their classic (and charismatic) counterparts (Zartan & the Dreadnok being the worst examples)?  All those things contribute to the problem but the simple fact is...this series is just boring, uninspired.

I'll tune-in to Season 2 to see if this show starts to feel like the G.I. Joe I grew to love but I won't be holding my breath.",1334188800,,718,4.435114503816794
5085645,5,B007GMKWYE,Glad they released this series. The dvd collection is really good. I wish it had sub titles though.,1453334400,,99,4.555555555555555

5085649,5,B007GMKWYE,"I remember when this series first debuted on T.V. and I couldn't always catch it because of school and work. Now, I can watch them all from the beginning and enjoy a series that may have only run for one season, but is no doubt one of the best G.I. Joe series ever created! Be sure to get Volume 2 to complete the collection.",1430956800,,325,4.09375

5085651,5,B007GMKWYE,"At first, when i had heard of this, i haven't had no clue that there was another GI Joe series so soon but as I saw it on TV, this one was really good wiyh a fresh take on the Joes. The Joes get framed for destroying a Cobra factory which makes them criminals and running from everyone that they could think and have to clear their name and still saving the world from Cobra Commander which he owns businesses among other things! Can't wait to see the second half of this underrated series in the G.I. Joe world even it make creative liberties to explain to today's kids! Yo Joe!",1419206400,2,579,4.225225225225225

5085653,5,B007GMKWYE,I was not much of a G.I. Joe fan until I got the version from Shout Factory. After seeing the annaversary version from the 1980's I got hook onto G.I. Joe a lot. G.I. Joe Renegades shows how the G.I. Joe team was put together. I recommend this if you are a die hard G.I. Joe fan.,1372809600,,279,3.912280701754386

8516433,4,B007GMKWYE,Fun series but sadly short lived. Starts with a nice base of characters and introduces additional characters through their (mis)adventures. A downside is that it's the same main characters as most of the recent iterations of G.I. Joe.,1458086400,,234,5.184210526315789
