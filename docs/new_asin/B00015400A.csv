8006611,5,B00015400A,I watched every detail of this DVD set of Shorin Ryu Karate. It's excellent materials for martial arts! I studied Wing Chun for quite a while. Both Wing Chun and Shorin Ryu Karate came from White Crane Kung Fu. I can tell that Hanshi Alexander certainly has a deep root on White Crane Kung Fu. His styles and kumite applications resemble many effective fighting methods of both White Crane Kung Fu and Wing Chun. Very authentic Okinawa fighting art. Not some highly modified versions for Karate sport competitions that Wing Chun practitioners would easily knock them down. It's for real combat!,1293235200,,594,4.891089108910891
8006612,1,B00015400A,"I did some research on Mr. Alexander after purchasing a few of these videos. His length of study with Yuichi Kuda is certainly questionable and I believe he gained his rank through being buddies with another Karate stylist. His techniques are not good Karate and the videos did little to improve my opinion of this person who is known to use videos and information not of his own for profit. Much better instruction can be found out there, and if you consider this guy a Master, you have never seen true Okinawan Shorin Ryu.",1185321600,8,524,4.585106382978723
8006613,5,B00015400A,This set is awesome. I really have learned alot. Hanshi Alexander is an excellent teacher & very clear on all the DVDs.  You really get your moneys worth.  I highly recommend this set.,1170892800,,184,4.545454545454546
8006614,5,B00015400A,I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. This is an amazing set on traditional Shorin Ryu Karate. It teaches all the forms and bunkai of the kata performed by a world renowned master of Shorin Ryu Karate. The seld defense techniques are awesome also. The 10 volume set is definitly worth the price!!! The material is priceless and a great reference set. It will give you a lifetime of material to learn and master. I know I have learned much of the fine points of karate after owning this set a short time and it made me realize how much I have to learn.,1129593600,,561,4.403846153846154
8006615,1,B00015400A,"Before purchasing and shelling out money for the entire 10 disc DVD set, I wanted to evaluate one DVD.  I purchased Volume 3.  The basis for my evaluation.

1. I currently study/practice Shorin Ryu Karate and Small Circle Jujitsu (SCJ) with 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Dans of Shorin Ryu and SCJ. Our studio student makeup has black belts and national champion from wrestling, Aikido, Judo, TKD, and BJJ.
2. The katas and techniques in Volume 3 (Pinan 4 and 5) were evaluated against other katas and techniques as found in Shorin Ryu Karate literature and DVDs.

Summary/Conclusion:

1. The picture and sound qualities were rather poor and indicative of a home video. Very non-professional.

2. The katas appear not to be performed correctly as compared against other Shorin Ryu Karate katas. Yes, katas are different among instructors and schools based on martial arts background and many other factors but the katas in Vol. 3 don't seem to represent Okinawan Shorin Ryu (e.g. big, open movements).  Where's the biomechanics for generating power? (e.g. the use of core and your arms act like a whip).

3. The techniques do not appear indicative of Shorin Ryu.  Alexander appears to use big, open movements.  These motions are indicative of traditional Japanese movements. These movements are more indicative of such styles where power comes from big motions, strength and in a nutshell, size.

4. Volume 3 may be used as a reference or study aid but I would not recommend it for those serious about preserving the art of Shorin Ryu. Consider ""Uchinadi"" by Oshiro produced by Tsunami. More professional production.

If Volume 3 is indicative of the set, then I would not purchase this DVD set. Personally, I do not plan on purchasing the set after the disappointment with Volume 3. Overall, just my opinion based on volume 3 and it's your money.",1128902400,7,1840,4.9
8006616,5,B00015400A,"As I had said before this is an excellent addition to any serious martial artist collection.

It was mentioned earlier that the katas in this series vary from those found on books or other sources. That is true and it is because the style, even though okinawan shorin ryu, varies from different schools. There are different association that regulate certain styles but the truth is that the styles have changed slightly through the course of time. I have investigated books, schools, and other videos which have help me come to this conclusion. Though there are many other arts that haven't changed much and mostly because they are rather new such as Judo, Krav Magra, and Aikido. Others arts much older such as Juijitsu, Karate, and Kung fu have many varieties of the style and even branch off into almost new styles altogether.

As far as the video quality is concerned it is not the best but it is good enough to learn and clear enough to show the techniques. In a way it gives you a feel like you are in the dojo and watching from where the other students would be.

The movements shown on the video are explained through the bunkai or practical application part of the tape. Some one mentioned that they appear to be very open as to show that the style more indicative of such styles where power comes from strength. Shorin ryu is a style where power is derived by speed more than strengh but it would be more apparent if that person would have seen the other videos. Shorin ryu conscentrates on speed as apposed to Shorei ryu which is focussed on power and strenght.

My responce to this comment;

""...Volume 3 may be used as a reference or study aid for street fighting or mixed martial arts as seen in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) but I would not recommend it for those serious about Shorin Ryu.""

In my opinion the UFC uses poor low quality fighters which for the most part lack technique and discipline could use ANY martial arts study aids to improve their fighting. This is a good tool for serious martial artist especially if you want to learn about Shorin ryu karate beyond just the fighting techniques.

8006617,5,B00015400A,"I bought this video set not sure what I was going to get and am proud to say that it has been worth it. Every penny. Every time I watch these, I learn something new and gain greater insight into this great karate style.",1091750400,,219,4.0
8006618,5,B00015400A,"This 10 volume set is a fantastic comprehensive series on Shorin Ryu Karate. It has helped me immensley with my training.
The 10th volume which is not discribed in the list is on KUMITE. It is a great breakdown on sparring and shows the best techniques to use and when to use them. I gained new knowledge from this series. It opened my eyes to many techniques I already knew and gave me new insight on how to use these techniques.",1084406400,4,430,4.320987654320987
