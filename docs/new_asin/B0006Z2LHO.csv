8043868,5,B0006Z2LHO,"Some of these reviewers are nuts to believe that this film is for everybody. If you don't like, don't watch. Simple as that. Don't come on here talking about racism and all that Sensitive America crap, you soft sensitive lame excuse for an American. That is all. I enjoyed this ""B"" movie because my crush was on here. Forget what the haters say.",1411171200,,345,4.492063492063492
8043869,3,B0006Z2LHO,"There was a blog that indicated there were a few pertinent quotes in the movie so I rented it.  There were a couple of good one liners, but this is a ""B movie"".  It doesn't try and hide the ""B movie"" genre, rather it seems to exaggerate this quality.  It isn't a ""bad movie"", it is an ""ok"" movie.",1371686400,,296,3.983050847457627
8043870,1,B0006Z2LHO,"In this movie you see white girls hangin' all over black guys,but there are no white men with black women. I am a white man,and I think black women are very beautiful,so I was pretty pissed off when I saw this. If this had been reversed,you know that alot of people,especially african americans,would be calling this film racist.",1353456000,,329,4.689655172413793
8043871,4,B0006Z2LHO,Hot Girls with lots of skin and it also made me laugh a few times. Not the best movie ever but worth a look!,1234051200,2,108,3.5416666666666665
8043872,1,B0006Z2LHO,"Dear Tom Ortenberg ,

My name is Linda Gates Freeman and I am an African American mother of three ( Clarence 8 , Tyrese 13 , and Sepia, ""missing""). I sing in my church choir , attend night school , work full time at the post office .I am deeply offended by the release of your film ""hittin' it "" , which insists to young male viewers that if they are not hittin' it , they are missin' it. What are they missin' exactly? Do we really need to encourage domestic violence in the community simply to make a dollar. Why don't you take a page from my book Mr. Ortenberg and get a good govment job. Maybe then you'd sleep at night.

Ms. Linda Gates Freeman
