8713087,1,B00WFHHNGA,"This video was really disappointing.  We were very excited because it was the only Knobsquatch documentary out there.  It was not scientific at all.  It was too short and a waste of time and money.

The first part of the video was about the town where Knobsquatch was sighted.  The interviews of the people in the town were interesting.  The rest was obviously a hoax.  The guy who had a TV show seemed likt the type of guy who would make a hoax.  The part where they went looking for Knobsquatch was obviously a hoax.",1442793600,,518,4.378947368421053
