2909120,5,B000TS9G3U,"Since I haven't seen every movie ever made, I'll just call this one of the five best of all time. Acting chops? NO ONE ever killed me like this. Olivier, Heston, Brando, Nicholson, not one has the range to do what Jackie did in this movie and he did it without ever saying a word. I'd give anything to get this on DVD or VHS. It's pure acting genius.",1233619200,,350,4.086956521739131
2909121,5,B000TS9G3U,This is such an amazing movie.  So poignant and unexpected from Jackie Gleason. He plays a deaf mute misunderstood and teased by others who befriends a young child in need.  Hope to find this soon as I haven't seen it since my childhood.,1230768000,,237,4.488372093023256
2909122,5,B000TS9G3U,"Don't know why the others only gave it a 4.  This not only shows Jackie at his best, but shows the depth of his talent = Top Notch.",1225152000,,131,3.6785714285714284
2909123,4,B000TS9G3U,"Let's start with Jackie Gleason in a non-speaking role. No ""Alice to the moon!"" tirades. Although Jackie was classic in his iconic role as Ralph Kramden and showed his unrivaled comedic abilities, let's set that aside. In Gigot, we get to see the strong and dramatically powerful performance that no one thought funny man Gleason capable of. Never will you see Gleason in such a deeply moving role. The sad eyes Jackie always had carry him through this film as if he had lived the life of Gigot in countless ways. This role was Gleason's unspoken ""I told you so"", even it that thought may never have entered his thoughts. Gleason deserves the recognition and a DVD tribute is in order.",1224288000,31,685,4.669421487603306
2909124,4,B000TS9G3U,I remember this film from my youth as Jackie Gleason at his best in playing the poor soul.  May be seen as melodramatic but I would love to see it again to test my youthful judgement.,1222905600,22,183,4.083333333333333
2909125,5,B000TS9G3U,"I saw this movie a couple of times, but it was years ago. It is excellent. This is a very funny movie, which also pulls on your heart strings. Jackie Gleason's expressions, while playing a mute, say more than many of today's ""actors"" can with their words. I would really like to see this available on DVD, or at least on VHS. It would be a shame to lose such a Gleason classic.",1203292800,10,377,4.178082191780822
2909126,5,B000TS9G3U,This is really good film with Gleason playing a Mute who has a heart of gold. You will see many of Gleason's famous characters from his variety show in his performance(the poor soul in particular). This was something of a pet project for Gleason and it should be available in some format!,1186272000,10,288,4.5576923076923075

2909130,5,B000TS9G3U,Being a fan of Jackie Gleason's for my whole life; this film shows him in a very different role than we're used to. We know he can make 'em laugh and this film shows he can touch all your other emotions as well. Thank you for shipping it so quickly.,1479081600,,249,4.0

2909135,5,B000TS9G3U,"GIGOT, ""leg of mutton"", is a beautifully acted, poignant movie, released in 1962. I've waited years for the VHS or DVD version starring Jackie Gleason as a poverty-ridden mute janitor, living in a Paris basement, spurned and mocked by neighbors, but possessing a heart of gold for children and animals, to come out. We all know Jackie Gleason as a great comedic actor; but his dramatic acting in Gigot is memorable. Gleason also conceived the story, and composed the music, which was nominated for an Academy Award, for the film.",1468022400,,529,4.888888888888889

I was expecting a plastic dvd box, so I printed out the cd box cover from the original advertising cover; and for the back I used the cast credits. I have tons of empty cd shells, so it's all good.

Why this movie didn't get more recognition is beyond me and speaking of beyond, this movie was well made, way beyond/ahead of its time; great story line, awesome acting, makes you want to see what happens next and Written by Mr. Jackie Gleason.  Everyone should see this movie!",1433289600,3,493,3.95959595959596

2909164,5,B000TS9G3U,"Gigot, pronounced Zhee-go, which means 'leg of lamb' in French; The Great One plays the title role of a big hearted mute that is looked on as the town idiot. He lives life simple and care free. Jackie is able to portray a wide variety of emotions without uttering a single word. He falls for a mother and her little daughter and is very protective of them. A lot of memorable scenes in this, The ending is fantastic and you'll see Jackie Gleason in as fine a role as you can get. I highly recommend this one!",1416960000,,508,4.247422680412371

2909168,5,B000TS9G3U,"This is a film that few people know about, but it's wonderful to watch. Jackie Gleason, normally thought of as a loudmouth, plays the part of a mute in Gigot. His incredibly expressive face made him a perfect choice for the role, or maybe it's the other way around - the role was perfect for him. Either way, he was incredible in this movie. His relationship with the woman and the little girl and the drunken scene in the bar were all memorable moments without him saying a word. His silent tantrum in the church was awesome.

You probably haven't seen this film before, and if you really enjoy older films that are simple, funny and touching, spend a couple bucks and get Gigot.",1407888000,5,680,4.483870967741935

Somehow, I recall a couple of minor scenes that are not in this version and a scene a fight scene in this one that I don't remember being in the original.  Because of those discrepancies, I gave it 4/5 stars.  However, both versions are good.  What other actor could star in a movie ""a talkie"" where he/she never speaks a word and make it a hit.  Jackie Gleason at his best!  Every actor and wanna be should watch this.",1393804800,2,486,4.217391304347826

Never mind Ralph Crampton or ""Smokey and the Bandit"" This is totally different and it shows what a really talented actor Mr. Gleason really was. He composed the music in the film also. This is a very touching and wonderfull story of a mute man who is looked upon as a harmless idiot whom everyone makes fun of and ridicules. He is though,a person with a heart of gold willing to give someone in need even what he doesn't have. This is defently a great family movie specially for very young kids and their adult care givers.

2909203,5,B000TS9G3U,"There's plenty of dialogue, but the great comic portrays a mute, and there is no narration.  The title character is called Gigot (French for ""leg of mutton""), a derisive name if ever there was one, and nobody likes him.  You the viewer are unlikely to like him.  Nor does he become a better person during the story.  He doesn't even like himself.  But by the time the closing credits roll, the entire cast loves him, and so will you.  You will laugh and cry at the same time.  Such is the achievement of Jackie Gleason in this film.  For you Jacques Tati fans, ""Gigot"" bears comparison to either of the M. Hulot films.",1380672000,,618,4.407079646017699

His concept (and original story) of Gigot (leg of lamb en francais) brought his humor, his dramatic power, his exceptional and connecting talents to a large audience.  The story was simple, often cruel, but delivered a powerful message to those whose interest in both entertainment and the story within the story helped to eliminate any doubt of the directorial talents of Gene Kelly and the acting and performing credentials of Jackie Gleason.",1380412800,,512,5.156626506024097

He grew up extremely poor alomost a youth without light, family breaking apart, drunkeness..and although he looked back in horror at this life in his personal life he later copied many of the vices he deplored in this home. Audrey Meadows recalls his office full of books on psychology, hypnotism..trying to retrieve memories that would make his life clear..like a looking glass to see the world at large...he was on tv the great entertainer from the early fifties to 1970..he started at warners after Jack warner saw his stand up and offered him$500/wk..as a bit player was he worth that $$..his show was a show of many comic characterizations tuned to tv and the Miami audience live, the cast rehearsed he didnt...in his office with a bottle of champagne..all those jokes of living it up..go back to his youth..now the standup and the tv comic..make the transition to film..having grown up in film on sets..he watched great movie stars..up close..watched and learn...and he still is the poor soul..the Chaplin type character like the KID..which this film resembles..but its curtailed and refined for film..is Bob Hope so good..are steve martin eddie murphy..Robin Williams..who also come from different entertainment mediums are faced with the same problem and at times lost they may appear deadpan or wooden..its a difficult problem for the actor..and here we have the lower class person living in the basement..not upstairs..dark and gloomy surroundings and like the later child he interacts with the animal world like the later child but not the prostitue..he picks up stray animals acts out a scene in a bar(good stuff and act) and from animals a prostitute and wayward little girl..and places all his attention on the girl..the little girl and forgets his own world and life and exists in her world and environment..and there is a carnival scene where the clown comes in..by the way this movie is in France not the U.S.
and eventually the prostitute leaves..removes herself from his environment and as she sais ""care"" just the girl remains and the basement collapses..a symbol of his world and he elaborates his own death..the town believes him dead..and later they see him alive..the town who hates him..and chases him away..there are also many religious scenes and he tries to instruct the little girl in the suffering image of jesus,,the mystical world of religion..dealing with suffering..and there's a funeral he attends at the start..of a community person who is a symbol of  apatriot cleaning up his community and dedicated to service..who later dies at the war front..as he too dies and a film's end..fakes a death..and later dies a pseudo death..at the hands of the town and all he stands for..chased out of the city..abandoned..a similar film is Papa's little Dividend..see also Requiem for a Heavyweight,
Ski Doo and How to Commit Marriage..how about How Do I LOve Thee..after his show ended he did many character films but the don't stand up to his 60's starring film roles too few in number unfortunately..really a talented performer who was taught early in films and learned, part of his mystical nature, a great entertainer since he could do so much on stage..and really took his cue from the audience ..MIAMI BEACH..on the old show a cyclist crashes against a wall and on the other side sees a poster for GIGOT..and the crowd applauds..I doubt it was much of a success outside of Miami..he had trouble financing..he probably paid out to make it..I'm not sure..the prestigious film company Seven Arts helped finance and produced it..a great film performance...from someone who started out in stage and films he wasn't really able to portray the romantic chaplin type character for lack of opportunity..although we see some of it in HOw do I Love Thee..he achieved great personal success but his personal life fell apart and continually came crashing down leading to personal excesses and frequent hospitalizations..GIGOT about finding a home was a lifelong endeavor of his and battling loneliness, finding intimacy..",1362700800,4,4591,5.024934383202099

2909271,5,B000TS9G3U,"After years of reading and hearing how good this film is, I finally saw it last night.

Why is this masterpiece not on (legitimate) DVD?

Essentially, it the story of JG as Gigot. He is a mute janitor in Paris, living in squalor and the butt of cruel humor in his neighborhood. One rainy night, he comes across a prostitute (a fact that is implied, remember this is a 1962 film) and her small daughter out in the rain. JG takes this couple to his slum apartment. While the lady of the night is as cruel to JG as everyone else, he bonds with the daughter.

Many people compare this film to Chaplin's THE KID. I disagree. I find it closer in spirit to Harry Langdon's ""Three's a Crowd"" (1927), as both Langdon and Gleason's characters are more of social outcasts than Chaplin's tramp. Some other viewers correctly mention the connection between this and Gleason's POOR SOUL character-the mute who preseveres in spite of ridicule from society-who appeared on the JG variety show in the 50s and 60s (sadly overshadowed by Ralph Kramden in public memory today). In either case, he transcends these similar concepts to make this film a story all his own.

There are some really memorable scenes in this film. The locals get their kicks out of getting JG drunk and watching him dance at the local pub. The cruelty in this scene is heart-wrenching, as is the scene where JG takes the girl to church and tries to explain the concept of Jesus to her. That one scene is to me JG's shining moment captured on film.

There are also some good laughs as JG dances to amuse the girl (his dancing here will be of added amusement to JG fans as they will recognize the moves of one of his other characters, playboy Reginald Van Gleason), and where he tries to follow the girl on the merry go round. You'll stand up and cheer for JG in the chase scene in the last 3rd of the film.

Speaking of the end, when it seems that you could predict the ending of the film in the last third of it or so, it takes a couple of surprising twists. The ending may not be satisfying to some (and no, I won't give it away here), but it does not subtract from the fact that the viewer has had quite and experience watching this.

The critics were not kind to this film in 1962, but the generation who either saw it as children at the time or stumbled on to it later seems (judging by the reviews on this and other sites) to unanimously love it, which justifies a (legit) DVD release (unauthorized versions abound). What are they waiting for! Bring this classic back to light for all to see and enjoy! This was Jackie Gleason's personal favorite of all his films. It's not hard to see why.",1320710400,6,2650,4.384928716904277
2909272,5,B000TS9G3U,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

As a heart warmer 'Gigot' belongs next to the motion picture 'It's a Wonderful Life' and ""Sound of Music"". Along with my review of this Jackie Gleason film, I give all of the reviewers 5 Stars! READ THEM! They say everything that needs to be said. Every reviewer rated the film 5 stars. One important thing I can add is that 'Gigot' was directed by another ""great one"" Gene Kelley, and that as a 'Mime' Gleason is equal to or better than Marcel Marceau. Gleason was never better. He delivers in this film the acting performance of his lifetime. ""How Sweet It ('Gigot') Is""!

There have been few films with acting as good as Gleason in 'Gigot'. Some of them are: Jimmie Stewart in 'It's a Wonderful Life', Julie Andrews in 'Sound of Music', Rickie Schroeder in 'The Champ', The two boys in 'Boy in the Stripped Pajamas', Lon Chaney Jr. in 'Of Mice and Men', and the actors in the newly released motion picture '17 Miracles'. Two short films with equally remarkable acting performances are: Francis Urry in 'Windows of Heaven' and Lethe Tatge in 'The Mailbox' (Won the highest award in it's category in 6 International Film Festivals). See Francis Urry's Bio on Google.  You can watch 'The Mailbox',  'Gigot',  and most of the above films online on UTUBE

'Gigot' is an ever so simple story about a deaf mute that you will never forget (and I only review films that will do this).

This morning 8-15-13, I realized why I love this film so much. it has to be one of best motion pictures of all time.

Gigot (the deaf mute) would join every funeral procession (whether he knew the person who had died or not) and weep with the mourners. He even joined his own funeral procession which is a hilarious scene from the film.  The following poem by John Donne expresses the virtue of such empathy.

No man is an island,
Each man's death diminishes me,
For I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know
For whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee.

Ask not for whom the funeral bells toll, they toll for THEE, for every man is YOUR brother a part of our great human family. To mourn with those that mourn, even mourning for those we do not know, to understand and feel how ohers feel inside, is one of the most noble of virtues. Nothing on film or in literature shows the virtue of empathy better than the film Gigot.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

I remember how incredibly poignant I found it, empathizing with his frustration at trying to communicate an abstract concept (religion) to a little girl without the ability to speak.  Watching this film is a self-contained study in the dramatic arts.  Just watch Gleason's face, particularly his eyes, through the picture to see the play of thoughts and emotions racing across them, only to be communicated by a small shrug, gesture or facial expression.

Gleason gives us a way to feel pure joy and happiness, then the frustration and anger of having both a disability and being impoverished while finding pure love for what may well be the first time and willing to do anything to keep a grip on it...

I highly recommend this movie to everyone and hope to see it available on DVD in the near future.,1236211200,5,276,4.226415094339623
8210541,5,B000TS9G3U,"I saw this when a high school student many moons ago - by myself, because all my friends had riven off and left me, because I was a bit late in finishing a lawn mowing job.  Of course, only one or two were really friends.  Feeling sorry for myself, this started in the right mood to make me feel even worse.  But it soon became clear that gigot was a very, very special work of art.  I left feeling that I missed one thing but found something much better.  Now that it is back on the market, after searching off and on for a log time, it feels the same.  This is a classic, and Jackie Gleason is a cut above what many would expect.  A true entertainer, a true artist. Buy this and watch with no interruptions if possible.",1522972800,,721,4.107142857142857

8210548,5,B000TS9G3U,Wonderful movie but it looks like it was transferred from a high school 16mm print. This movie needs a blu-ray treatment. It doesn't even fill up the screen. Very sad.,1496188800,,167,4.6
8210549,5,B000TS9G3U,Back in the Sixties this film was downplayed for being too sentimental.  This was Gleason's first film he wrote and scored the music in.  It's the only work of his I remembered that I considered on of his better films.  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of his television show of the same era but it was the root of what was to make him a great comedian and actor.  Give it a look.  It will be worth it.,1495497600,,404,4.063291139240507
