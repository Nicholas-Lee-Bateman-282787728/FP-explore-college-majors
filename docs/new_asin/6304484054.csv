891774,5,6304484054,"Although totally gross and expertly badly-acted this is one of the funniest films ever made.  Divine is hilarious as usual but the best of all comes from Edith Massey as the ""egg lady"".  I remember seeing  this movie at a midnight showing in the village, Manhattan.  There, it was  standing room only! People would actually puke at the dog poo scene.  What  a riot!",913161600,,365,4.609375

891849,5,6304484054,This is probably John Waters's best known early film.  It is amazing for it's time and for the budget it was made with.

891888,4,6304484054,"Bizarre yet hilarious and oddly prescient of today's current ""trash"" culture, this movie makes the boys from Jackass look like amateurs. Criminal Divine (Divine)  and her whacky family are hiding out in a trailer in Baltimore.  Elsewhere in town a snooty perverted couple are jealous of Divine's title of ""Filthiest person alive"" and challenge her to a game of filth. Disgusting, wild hilarity ensues and the ending of this movie is infamous and bordeline iconic.

891892,4,6304484054,"Film guide critics Martin and Porter call this 'the ultimate shock movie'. Critics love to exaggerate and bask in controversy, but the reality happens to be far less shocking and offensive than these two claim. The intended purpose of making this movie may have been to shock, but the viewer soon becomes aware of its deliberate tongue-in-cheek approach toward producing transgressive cinema. The plot is impishly deviant and the campy performances are clear examples of intrepid play-acting. With Pink Flamingos, director John Waters achieves exactly what he set out to do: amuse the youth and disturb the elders.

Prepare yourself for toe-sucking, incest, exposed anuses, and the consumption of something organic, yet undoubtedly inedible. If you can disregard all that your mom classified as 'improper' and get beyond the ick-factor of this movie, then you'll likely find the excesses and degradations of Pink Flamingos sustainably humorous. The fact that a couple is competing with a glamorous, overweight transvestite for the title of the 'Filthiest Person Alive' makes it a comedy. Over-the-top acting makes it a comedy. Tacky costumes and sloppy narration make it a comedy. Watching Pink Flamingos will hard-wire your brain to expect the unthinkable with every oncoming scene. It's exciting and sleazy, yet fresh in the sense that it'll take you where most filmmakers would never dare to go. Mix Vegas trash with porn, Mr. Roger's Neighborhood with Grey Gardens and this is the twisted result. (3.5 stars)",1474329600,,1512,5.3

891967,4,6304484054,"I'm born, raised and for better or worse still live in Baltimore.  The magic of JW's films, especially from the 70s and early 80s, is he magically captured what many believe might have been this very small subset of underground characters, lost in time if not for his films.  What he has done however is captured what essentially was the spirit of an entire population, all gorded up on Esskay hot dogs, National Bohemian Beer, and Bethlehem Steel smoke when those companies were major cornerstones of the one time ""small"" city.  Its odd then that I probably watched Desperate Livin' and Hairspray (the 1988 version!) on a Luskins bought TV set in my youth but PF actively avoided my and I probably avoided it until recently.  The bad news - it hasn't really aged well, and being older I can see how JW grew and truly tried to make his movies better and more engaging (for instance, of this era, I rank Female Trouble above this and Desperate Living  above that).  The good news is it doesn't fall into mediocrity all that badly (I still consider Polyester the weakest of his films).  It's also disturbing, in 2016 at least, to watch a live chicken die the way it did on film here.  That turtle in Cannibal Holocaust got off easy in my opinion!  Either way, recommended for a good time viewing, great for parties, and absolutely essential if you're any kind of JW fan.",1462147200,2,1368,4.573770491803279

891971,3,6304484054,"Its an okay movie. Its overall purpose is for shock value, and in the 70's a lot of these acts were considered shocking. However, with todays mass media, and internet experience, most of this movie seems silly, and not so much shocking. There was only one scene that shocked/ angered me, and that was the (spoiler alert) man having relations with a women, while holding chickens. He eventually killed the chickens....yes...he really killed them. However, most of the film's shock value consists of: large male walking down a city street dressed in drag (like I had said, in the 70's this was shocking). A couple making love, and continuously sucking on each other's toes. Devine eating actual dog poo. Devine shoving raw meat up her dress...Okay? and the crazy egg lady, who always wants eggs. There is more, and it is an interesting movie. However, for my own personal taste, I was not impressed by this film. The acting feels like acting, and the film feels very old/dated. However, I  have invested in this film, and I will eventually watch it again...for whatever reason. If you're that interested in knowing what this film is about, just buy it (for a decent price). It's worth the investment just to get that curiosity monkey off your back.
THE STORY:
Devine is a woman who has the reputation of being the most disgusting person in the world... or something like that?
There are two other people (a dude with blue hair, and woman with red) who are trying to earn that title for themselves. This, bizarre couple has an adoption agency. The babies come from women, who the couple keeps locked in their basement. These women are rap-d by the couples man servant, and that's where the babies come from (gross). Devine has her own little bizarre life/ family. A mother who is obsessed with eggs, a son who likes strange s-x, while his sister likes to watch. And that is pretty much the movie in a nut shell.",1458432000,,1908,4.678571428571429

I barely got halfway through it and had to stop. The so-called ""gross"" parts; the poop eating, Divine in clownface, the cruelty, was pretty tame compared to modern films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Centipede/dp/B004KAQV2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Centipede</a>. That didn't bother me at all. What I found unbearable was the film itself - the pointless story, the slow pacing, the uninspired dialog, the unremarkable direction - as ""cinema,"" it was unwatchable. Many films have second act problems, but when it can't get off the ground, when the movie has barely started and you're already looking at your watch, that's the mark of a waste of celluloid. Maybe I would have enjoyed this when I was twelve and it showed up at the local fourth-run theater, but with less time remaining in the hourglass, I can't justify spending it on something like this, just to say that I saw it.

""Pecker"" maintains the in-your-face deviance, the wackiness, and the undertone of discomfort that John Waters is known for, and is actually a decent film about a young man finding his artistic voice. But ""Pink Flamigos,"" ""written, directed, produced, filmed, conceived, financed, and extruded"" by Mr. Waters, early as it was on the way to his finding his own voice, is a failure on every level.",1402790400,5,1711,5.657587548638133

The uninitiated simply will not understand, as it is a film that must be experienced rather than explained. The film centers around Divine, an overweight drag queen who has earned herself the title of ""The Filthiest Person Alive"" by the local tabloids for her disreputable acts and disgusting living conditions that she shares with Mama Edie, Cotton, and her son, Crackers. Here to steal her throne are Connie and Raymond Marble, an eccentric pair whose excessive wealth has led them to seek out more extreme forms of entertainment. Connie and Raymond's sordid attempts to humiliate and destroy Divine lead to an all out war for the title of ""The Filthiest People Alive."" PINK FLAMINGOS was purposefully made to shock and disgust, with the intent of using the film's notoriety to boost John Waters' career. Needless to say, it worked. There are no lines that won't be crossed in this circus of depravity, from bestiality, rape, incest, and torture, to the final infamous shot of Divine scooping up freshly-squeezed dog poop and eating before the camera. Mama is kept in a playpen as she babbles on about eggs, while Crackers is out back experimenting with his new chicken fetish for Cotton to look in on. Over at the Marble residence, we learn that Connie and Raymond have been kidnapping girls and impregnating them so that they can turn a quick profit on the babies before murdering their mothers. And this is just a taste of the insanity that is in store. The atrocious acting and absurd plot only add to the trashy camp and utterly dark yet hilarious humor in PINK FLAMINGOS. Waters would go on to direct a number of popular cult comedies, though nothing could ever compare to his first underground hit.

892450,2,6304484054,"This is a good flick if you like utterly non-sensical and comedic shock footage from the early days of grainy picture, cheesy effects, and mono sound.

This is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Doesn't do much for me besides demonstrate how I could have been a success as a movie maker in the 70's with much less ideas, creativity, and thought into script writing (even if I did just as much drugs). Apparently the cult fanatics believe the director broke ground here with such a shocking movie; shock movies can actually provoke a great deal of thought to the viewer if they actually make sense or at least attempt to follow a basic plot line.
Here is a SPOILER to save all those, like myself, that do like well-made shocking movies that burn into your memory, from watching this poorly made joke of a film. Do not read below if you have already made up your mind to buy this movie based on other reviewers, but feel free to comment or add anything if you are someone that actually saw this back in the day when it was released.

Transexual diva named ""Divine"" lives with family in a trailer with a plastic pink flamingo outside and is known for being most disgusting and crazy person in US (which I guess means world to this film). A jealous couple want to be most disgusting and crazy people in US. Jealous couple kidnaps young women, impregnates them with kidnapped young man and sells the babies on the black market to prove how crazy they are. Couple begins trying to sabotage ""Divine"" and family to overtake her reputation.

Divine and family, including a morbidly obese, mentally challenged mother and son who likes using live chickens in a sexually deviant way, begins fighting back to maintain her reputation by breaking into couples business, freeing kidnapped women who castrate kidnapped man that impregnated them, and then licks all furniture in business to taint it. Divine then gives ""Divine touch"" (incest act) to her son in graphic porn fashion. Divine kidnaps jealous couple and shoots them dead.

And then she walks down the street with her family and watches small dog crap. Then she eats it.

The end. Not kidding. If you can engage in any of the actors conversations or can even follow along with the dialogue for the entire movie, you must have extraordinary concentration and focus.

Director's favorite deleted scene from dvd extras: Director filmed Divine and family speaking a song in pig latin while holding hands and skipping along.

If you do not watch this movie with an open mind, free from your concepts of what is considered moral and decent in our society, you will be shocked, offended, disgusted, repulsed, and sickened by at least 3 or 4 scenes in this movie.

It is also a pretty funny movie, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The acting and dialogue are either really really bad or really really good but definitely really really funny. Divine's performance is actually quite good. So, whether or not this movie is good or bad is going to depend on the viewer. It is definitely a movie you will remember after watching it, even as you try hard to forget some of the things you have seen. There has to be some value in a movie that stays with you in this way.

892498,5,6304484054,"John Waters will forever be remembered for his classics of dark comedy & crude satire but no film of his shall ever hold a candle so bright to the infamous Pink Flamingos. Never before have such revolting images displayed evoke such gleefulness nor has any director before or after Waters captured the true spirit of bad taste on such a micro budget.

Pink Flamingos basically revolves around the twisted lives of two families in Baltimore who pride themselves on being the most filthy people in the world & that's a tough act to follow.  Waters is not unlike world renowned artist Andy Warhol in the respect that he wishes to throw pop-culture right back in America's face. Well, except Waters takes it all much further in the annals of putrid comedy as if Warhol's contributions were a tad meager. Welcome to the world of sleaziness, trashy conspirators, & evil doers run amok in this delightful film of America's rejects.

Divine has been branded the most filthiest person alive. Having been forced underground, she lives in a trailer somewhere off the beaten path with her egg-obsessed mom, a voyeuristic travel companion,  & her dirty son Crackers. Although Divine prides herself as being a figure of repulsion, she has taken the pseudonym Babs Johnson just to keep everyone safe from society. Babs is a bonafied criminal guilty of numerous charges which could include cannibalism, murder & possibly sex crimes of every variety.

Raymond & Connie live in a more well-to-do section of Maryland & are actually quite envious of Divine. Wishing to claim that title of being the filthiest people alive, they are determined to run Divine clear out of town. The notorious couple are known for capturing young females which serve as slaves in their filthy basement to copulate with their gay servant. The babies are then sold to lesbians for about $5,000 a child & the proceeds are used to finance stores of pornography or front drug dealers. The gay servant not only impregnates these poor girls but then is required to dispose of their corpses after they die in child birth.

Our lovely couple even hires a spy by the name of Cookie to seduce Divine's son Crackers in hopes of attaining more information on the filthy family such as an address so they can torture her & send policeman who will put an end to Bab's birthday bash. Policeman do show up at the party, of course, but they meet an untimely demise & then the motley crew proceeds to feast on their human remains. Again, it's a gruesome site for sure but it's all in good fun.

After learning of the couple's plans to thwart Divine's operation of being the most repulsive woman alive, Crackers & Divine decide it's time to take revenge & pay the couple a visit in which more sleaziness ensues. Note: There is the infamous scene in which Divine bequeaths her motherly love to Crackers which will either generate much unprecedented laughter or upset stomachs. John Waters knows how to have a good time with his audience & the fun doesn't stop here.

Pink Flamingos is perhaps of my all-time favorite examples of guerrilla film-making or indie cinema done correctly with only a micro budget of $10,000.

892549,5,6304484054,"WOW!!! I just read David R. Crews' review of ""Pink Flamingos"" and it really took me way back. Not just the flick itself, but the whole lifestyle. WOW!!! I saw PF at the Biograph in Georgetown in 1973 and my unformed, immature, inexperienced teenage mind was woefully unprepared for Mr. Waters' merciless assault on everything decent and good in this world. An outcast's ultimate revenge, I guess you could call it. Anyway, the Biograph was an extremely forward-thinking establishment, but to my knowledge the management never willingly permitted marijuana smoking or alcohol consumption on the premises during movies. Too bad. So Mr. Crews and his friends clearly got by far the better deal that way. All the Biograph audience members arrived in an intoxicated state, although we were unable to continue adding to our inebriation in the theater. Pity. So when PF unreeled on the screen everyone just sat there in shock, rather than being in a party frame of mind. More like accident victims or something; not like a bunch of impaired revelers enjoying a film. So, like I said, we all just sat there in a literal state of shock. I'm not kidding - we were all actually stunned from start to finish. It seemed like being an unworthy opponent of Muhammad Ali in his prime - all we could do was absorb punishment to our brains until it was finally over and we were barely able to stumble outside in utter confusion. ""What the hell was that?"" was the universal comment afterwards. So if the definition of genius is the ability to deeply and profoundly affect everyone who sees your work, then it  certainly looks like Mr. Waters is a genius. An evil, heartless, sadistic genius to be sure, but still a genius nevertheless. Just like Mr. Crews, I never want to see that movie again - once was plenty, that's for sure. Remember the eyelids-propped-open scene in ""A Clockwork Orange""? Showing PF like that would be excellent behavior-modification therapy. Or punishment, albeit both cruel and unusual. I actually felt sorry for Roger Ebert because he had to watch it again when the 25th Anniversary Edition came out in 1997. Mr. Ebert promised back then that if he's still around for the 50th Anniversary Edition then he will retire rather than watch it a third time. This should give pause to those of us who think watching movies for a living is a soft gig.

So anyway, the whole point of PF was that Mr. Waters was just beginning his bizarre career and he needed a way to make himself stand out from the crowd. He succeeded brilliantly and beyond all reasonable expectations. PF put him on the map for good and he was able to get financing and distribution and big-name participation for all his strange visions from then on. I had wanted to say that he then began using his awesome powers for good, but that just doesn't sound quite right. All his other flicks have proven him to be extremely talented, although in a disturbing sort of way, and he has even become a kind of national treasure. Not sure it's legal to describe John Waters as a national treasure, though. Hmmm....",1288828800,,3072,4.70817843866171

I simply loved Divine. He was amazing as Babs Johnson. He was funny and just extremely divine. Mink Stole also does a great job as Babs rival for the title.

892585,4,6304484054,"I was at the very first showing of John Waters' poodle poop munching and side-splittingly hilarious cinematic masterpiece Pink Flamingos. It was shown in a mid-sized and rather comfy auditorium at the Maryland Institute of Art on Mount Royal Avenue in Baltimore, Maryland.

At the time, 1972, it was several months after my stint in the U.S. Army as a Public Information Office photographer on Okinawa. I had experienced many wild and crazy happenings on Okinawa - with a lotta hip and funny friends and acquaintances from all over America, which had set my 21-yr-old mind up real well for the off-beat cinematography, the right-on-time (as we Hippies used to say) screen writing and filthy, avant garde humor of Pink Flamingos.

I only attended the premiere of Pink Flamingos because my girlfriend at the time, Johanna, had close friends who knew some people real well who had filmed a movie in and around Baltimore. And it was the first movie I ever knew of being made in my hometown of Mobtown.

During the 1966 era, I was a Rock 'n Roll kid from the Dundalk suburbs of Baltimore who had spent a lot of time hanging out with other teenagers in Downtown Baltimore's Howard St. Corridor and on up into the Beatniks'/Mods'/Hippies' long time fave the Read St./Tyson St. neighborhood. That Baltimore was a fantastic place in time to shop, eat, hangout in Mount Vernon Park, happily walk the busy main streets and side streets and further off to the side streets and interesting alleys and safe sidewalks there, whilst marveling at the fantastic old architecture all around. That was also where some of the movie Pink Flamingos was filmed, because the film crew were mostly a solid group of Avant Garde Baltimore Hipsters.

In 1972, my old girlfriend Johanna and I each lived out in the suburbs of Baltimore, and we had driven together to her friends' apartment up in downtown Baltimore - to go to the show with them. They lived in one of those huge, old, wearing down, Baltimore apartment houses that have wide, deep and welcoming front porches with ornate antique doors that have beautiful stained glass transoms over top of them. Johanna and I steadily admired the old time craftsmen crafted woodwork of the front porch, staircases, wall trim and floors in that place. The friends' apartment had high ceilings and bright lighting. It was furnished in the style of young working people who know how to spend their wages wisely on really cool stuff.

It was a very cool surprise to discover that one of Johanna's friends was an old friend of mine - Mike - from them '66 era Mod days in Baltimore. Mike had sold me my first bag of marygeewanner - right underneath the tall and mighty Washington Monument on Charles St.. That first pot purchase of mine had been a scrawny little nickel bag that was cut (adulterated) with bird seeds and oregano. This was so early in the late 1960s pot smoking revolution that we Baltimore boys and girls didn't hardly have an idea of what pot is. 1960s Maryland was way behind California in all things hip and happening.

On that Pink Flamingo Premier evening, in 1972, at Mike and friends' apartment, they showed me a nice little pile of mild mannered Mexican Marijuana setting on their grand old, thrift shop purchased, big heavy dark wooden, antique dinning room table. Then they happily informed me that we could smoke some weed at the movie showing; and then one of Mike's roommates inquires about my joint rolling skills. One of my Army buddies, Bart from Frisco, had grown up two blocks from the infamous Haight-Ashbury - he used to sometimes hear outdoor Grateful Dead Concerts from his family's front porch - consequently he knew the very best techniques for rolling a good smoking joint and had taught me how to, too. So's, I sat right down at that big old friendly dining room table - with smiling faces all around me - and we two new friends rolled some up for smoking then and some for movietime.

All of a sudden, I realized that if we could smoke weed there, can we drink beer there also?, so I asked; and someone replied, with a huge smile, ""Sure,"" so I declared I'd buy enough cold beer for us all to comfortably fortify our reefer buzz with a beer buzz. Pot and beer consumption was common practice amongst young Americans of the 1970s. Most of us survivors of them '70s party-hearty days gave that practice up a long time ago, though.

Anyways, we left that apartment with a pleasant buzz on and headed for the closest place to buy beer, then we went to the Art Institute. We sat in the college auditorium at stage left about in the middle of the fold down, padded seating on that side. The movie crew and their attending family and friends were gleefully ensconced over in the seating to the right. My guess has always been that there were fewer than 80 of us there that night.

John Waters wore a frumpled, white jump suit, and it was the thing to do at the moment. He looked absolutely marvelous, with the self assured, young, ahead of his time, struggling movie maker way he moved around in that jump suit. That frumpled-just-right-for-avant-garde-fashion-tastes jumpsuit on John just fit the scene perfectly.

The lights went down, the movie began, I handed someone close to me a joint to light, another joint was lit behind me, beer can pop tops hissed open, and what a wild night-of-a-lifetime that became.

It weren't but a few minutes till the laughs started rolling all up and down and sideways back and forth through the audience. The humor got filthier and more hilarious while the laughter grew heavier and more rib-racking-gut-busting-side splitting-debilitating with every well conceived, well written and daringly delivered punch line in the movie plot. T'weren't long before several of us actually slid sideways out of our movie seats, a time or two, and fell on the floor laughing. Not one person there could sit up straight in their seat for more than a few seconds, tops. The audience literally rocked and rolled and roared with laughter the whole movie through. By the time Devine beats out green haired - the carpet matched the rug - Connie and Raymond Marble for the title of ""The Filthiest Person Alive"" - when Devine definitely did munch on fresh, steaming poodle poop, on the southeast corner of Read and Tyson Streets - most of us there had laughed harder and longer than we ever had in any of our hip, young lives. We were in serious, but welcomed, pain, too - our ribs ached.

I can never forget how Devine had looked up past the movie camera and at the crew (of his close friends) behind the camera, as he slowly knelt down and munched off a piece of that doggy doo. When the scene came on, while from within me and all around me there rose a rumbling chorus of titillating ""Oh no, oh no""s, I very studiously watched and fully determined that the little ol' poodle had indeed pooped, and the camera had stayed on the dog, it's droppings and Devine for the entire scene; so there were no camera tricks pulled, no chocolate flavored mashed potatoes replaced the dog doo just before Devine tasted it; and I clearly saw that Devine was quickly thinking - something to the effect of - ""Waters, one way or the other, someway somehow, you are going to pay dearly for this. I want more money, your gassed up car for a week, plenty of pot, bottles of my favorite booze, plus some good nasty sex with somebody on this crew, and I'm directing that scene in my life.""

After the movie ended, John Waters went up onto the stage to thank his actors and the movie crew members for their hard work, plus us others in the audience for our part in assuring him he was on his way to fame and fortune through lots more hard work and badass-artistic-ballsyness.

John beckoned for Pink Flamingos movie star Edith the Egg Lady - shyly giggling, long time thrift store maven, Edith Massey - to come up on stage, and he presented her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

Then I realized that Devine should have been asked up on stage to receive a bouquet too, but he was not in the audience over there with the other movie makers nor anywheres else, consequentially, I safely surmised right away why Devine probly didn't come to the premier - he was too embarrassed by the poodle poop incident.

I have not seen Pink Flamingos again, and I do not plan on seeing it again. That just seems farrrr tooo anticlimactic for my life. I mean, well now, seeing 1960s Baltimore stuff, the weird fashions the movie characters wore and hearing outlandish lines delivered throughout the story would be really good to enjoy today on clear sounding DVD; but the movie could never hit me like it did when Johanna, Mike, friends and I were hit with something near deadly hilarious that we had no idee' was comin' at us.

It's one of those so gross it's funny movies-I admire John's ideas, but some are so ridiculous, you can't help but laugh at them, so people I guess didn't get the joke-I did, it wasn't hard either.
Like other customers have said, comedy or not this isn't for anyone with a weak stomache, cause there are a couple scenes that are pretty gross, Serial Mom is still my favorite movie by John Waters, but this one clearly explains why he's dubbed the king of bad taste, and he wears the crown proudly. A word of caution, the last minute tops everything, make sure you've digested your meal way before you see it, trust me.",1266537600,,744,4.20979020979021

Since watching this movie, I've switched to broiling my meat to simply strapping it around my thighs and walking around in high heels.  The workout one receives from this, from the calories it burns to the big calves, is second to none (except perhaps if someone were to do P90X with the meat strapped to their thighs while wearing high heels).  I've now found that I'm able to beat my father's friends at naked Twister when I visit him at the adult assisted living home (the number one excuse for losing seems to always be they're tired from just having sex).

So forget about reading ""The Secret"" again; besides, laws of attraction don't work when you're reading a book alone.  Go buy this immediately and throw yourself a ""meat and greet"" viewing party.

892589,4,6304484054,"NEVER watch this movie alone, or in a small group.  IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WHEN VIEWED IN A LARGE GROUP!  There is so many things that make you say, ""ah, I really didn't want to see this,"" that you will never make it through the film.  However, if you can manage to see it on the big screen in a room full of 100 people, go for it.  It then becomes an experience, and while the gross scenes are not any less gross, they do become more funny.  The best way to describe my reaction to the film is I was cracking up more then I have at almost any other film; there were tears in my eyes.  However, while doing so, I was not able to look at the screen because I just couldn't watch.

That said, if you're not able to get past the... well, let's call them speed bumps... then you will not enjoy the film.  In other words, don't take anything you see to heart.  It's a film, be grossed out then forget about it when the next scene starts.",1257984000,2,949,4.059139784946237

892594,3,6304484054,"John Waters has already had just one goal in mind...to shock everyone and prove to the world that he's weird.
He is really a man ahead of his time. He's like that 14 year old emo boy hanging out in Hot Topic who just tries and tries to be the weirdest guy at the mall, but at the end your heart aches with embarrassment for him because he just looks like a desperate moron. Like Cradle of Filth fans who actually call themselves vampires and drink their own blood.
John Waters are those kids with a video camera. There's shocking and then there's trying so hard to be shocking that you end up just looking stupid. This movie is the latter.
The acting is the worst ever (1st grade class rendition of The Sound of Music bad). The storyline is rather lame and the neon red and blue hair looked better on Alex's parents in A Clockwork Orange.
KIDS was a shock movie that actually tried to have a story. This is a shock movie that doesn't try to have anything and in that regard it succeeds. I guess I'm just incredibly jaded and impossible to shock because I found nothing in the movie outrageous, but that might be because the movie is obviously just a desperate attempt to shock with no other goals at all.
I gave it three stars only because Waters is a master of drawing you in just enough that you're willing to sit through this crap to see if it ever becomes worth watching. I figure he deserves some recognition for that, at least.",1242086400,,1433,4.330855018587361

You see, once in a lifetime someone makes a movie that can hold its own as a real stinker that is funner than hell. And this movie is it. It covers all that is bad in only a way Waters could.

I was very well aware of its reputation and especially of the last scene and I was literally afraid to see it. At last, I made up my mind, took all my courage and watched the impossibly obscene, terribly disgusting, outrageous to a limit, shocking to a nausea, but at the same time extremely funny criminal cult comedy. The film that was made on the shoe-string budget by the self-proclaimed king of bad and nasty taste, native Baltimorian, Mr. John Waters, in 1972, still has not become outdated and would shock you like no other. If you only imagine something disgusting, mean and dirty, rest assured - Waters uses it in the film, his debut feature, and has a lot of fun with it. He does not care a bit how shocking the characters on the screen are and what moronic things they do to each but somehow, the film maintains light,playful, and comical feel about it. If someone had told me before I saw ""Pink Flamingos"" that the graphic scenes of exhibitionism and incest could be hysterically funny, I'd suggest they should seek a medical help but these scenes and many others ARE funny maybe because the first time writer/director and his friends performers did not take any of what was happening on screen seriously, did not try to make any sense, did not rebel or make a statement or try to prove something. All they wanted to do - to shock the viewers and to make them laugh. They achieved their goals. I would not urge everyone to seek out and to watch ""Pink Flamingos"" but its unique niche in cinema makes it one of its kind event. If you decide to watch it, do it on empty stomach - as much as I tried not to look at the screen during the infamous final scene, it is still hard to ...well, swallow.

The movie sold itself under the tagline, ""An exercise in poor taste."" That turned out to be a very restrained characterization.

I'd have given it one star were it not for the occasional inanely humorous moments. Divine is certainly a larger than life personality. I was also interested in the performance of the late Cookie Mueller who was featured in a Nan Goldin book I had a chance to peruse several months ago.

892649,4,6304484054,"Pink Flamingos really was the film John Waters made to make him famous--and it worked, although he didn't truly enter mainstream cinema for some years to come. The plot moves along rather well--better than I expected; and the acting is great. The scenes and plot are so silly that I found it entertaining although I wouldn't give it quite the full five stars.

The action begins when Connie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole and David Lochary, respectively) become involved in a huge fight with Babs Johnson, a.k.a. Divine (Divine) over who is the filthiest person alive. The Marbles even hire a spy, Cookie (Cookie Mueller) to get them the dirt (no pun intended) on Divine and her family. Divine lives in a broken down trailer home in the woods. Divine's crazy son Crackers (Danny Mills), her mentally challenged, egg loving mother Edie (Edith Massey) and her good friend Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce) live with her.

The Marbles start to torture Divine and her family not just with a spy but also with the lovely (ahem) package they send to Divine--a piece of ""number two."" Of course it's only a matter of time before Divine and her family attack the Marble's home; and The Marbles attack Divine's home.

Be prepared--this is no movie for the squeamish. There are scenes of (ahem) rather unusual modes of love making, human mutilation, and there's the infamous scene at the end in which Divine eats a dog's you-know-what. Actually, the last scene is so talked about it came off as slightly less (well, very slightly less) repugnant than I thought it would be.

The movie was made on a very, very low budget, so if you want great cinematography and choreography, look elsewhere. I would suppose, however, that the choreography works well in crowd scenes including the scene in which everybody at Divine's birthday party attacks the police.

The DVD comes with a 12 minute 25th anniversary extra that gives us deleted scenes from the movie; and we get the original theatrical trailer as well.

Overall, Pink Flamingos may not be as bad as they say it is--I rather liked it. Sure, it's a tad gross at times; but it's all in good fun. This movie should appeal to adults who can handle creative movies that are clearly out of the mainstream.

Thank you, John Waters!",1193097600,34,2258,4.759590792838875

I won't throw it out or give it away, lest it fall into the wrong hands, but I also can't bring myself to destroy it- it is the test, the ultimate standard by which all other movies, and sometimes people, are judged.

First, you must ask yourself- do I want to watch this movie?  CAN I watch this movie?

If you successfully watch the movie, you can either award yourself great kudos for facing the horrors that the human mind can inflict, or you can hang your head in shame for being unphased.  If this movie does not gross you out at least once, you REALLY have some soul searching to do.  Learn to read...something..

Second...I have told many people...if anyone recommends this film to you...he or she is not your friend.  If they're doing it to shock you...maybe they're still okay...if they say, ""Hey, I know this great movie...""  Run.  This is not a person you need to be around.

Third...you may want to watch this movie so that you understand the rest of us.  ""It's not Pink Flamingos bad, but it's up there.""  or ""It was like Pink Flamingos with old people.""  This means nothing to you if you haven't seen it.  Maybe that's a good thing.

This review may be a little disjointed...it's like John Waters just wanted to see how far he could go and still get paid.  It's like the 'joke', ""What has 2 legs and bleeds?....Half a cat.""  It's not funny, but you laugh at the audacity that someone had to tell that as a joke.

I have experienced Pink Flamingos.  I'd give it no stars if I could, because I think it's an excercise in EXTREMELY bad taste, but it's a fascinating social experiment.  John Waters...I shake my head in wonder at you...",1174348800,7,1718,4.424920127795527
892695,5,6304484054,Pink Flamingo is an early film made by John Waters.  It's not for the faint of heart and certainly not for children.  If you like an off beat cult like film than this is the one for you.,1174262400,,186,3.8684210526315788

Unless you are sick and twisted and you are inbred, you don't want to watch this movie. I have no idea why anyone would like this. Sex with chickens and eating dog poop. Need I say more.

Just thinking of this movie makes me want to vomit and take many showers to wash off the disgustingness of it.",1174262400,4,410,4.189873417721519
892697,5,6304484054,"If any movie does not need a review, critique, or summary, it's PINK FLAMINGOS, the seminal [pun intended] shrine to perversity and to wanton, remorseless stupidity; but since PINK FLAMINGOS is so much about everything gratuitous, I'm going to run my yap about it for a few paragraphs or so. I can't say I'll do it justice, but words can hardly be expected to evoke to the (sublime?) experience of watching an obsese drag queen eat canine feces for no particular reason at all. (Yes, kids, it's just that good. And it's good for you.)

The disclaimer part. As an act of community service, I'll advise the religious, the Republican, and the otherwise overly sensible among us to avoid this film. In fact, if any of the aforementioned ever find themselves even in the vicinity of the DVD, they'd be best off either fleeing from it or ritualistically destroying it. OK. Let's be more to the point. We know each other well enough, don't we? If you don't want to watch some guy inseminating an imprisoned ""hippie"" in a dungeon with a turkey baster so that the baby produced may be sold to upper class lesbian couples, then switch the channel to Patch Adams. Or if the sight of a man puckering and contorting his anus leaves you wanting to write letters to your congressman, pastor, and mother, then maybe you're too hip for this.

So the usual Waters stable of finely-trained thespians has been assembled: Mink Stole, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Edie the Egg Lady, and, of course, the eponymous Divine, equally glam and macabre as the self-proclaimed Filthiest Person Alive, Babs Johnson. Admittedly, Divine's Best Actress moment comes in the electric chair in Waters' FEMALE TROUBLE, but she's dead-on here as well, in her red fish-tail dress and her circus clown make-up. (Wait. Scratch that. Even Clarabelle was more sparing with the eye shadow.)

One thing I love about Pink Flamingos, if I may get personal, is that it's the real deal. It isn't the big studios playing at gross-out with big name stars, or about test-marketed film-making, or even about film school pretension. It's just a bunch of drug users, freaks, and losers, who are all winners in my book. What else can one say about a film that makes an utterly deplorable character somehow, in a twisted and inscrutible way, endearing?

I was tricked into thinking that this movie had that same silly, campy, retro-humor like Crybaby and Hairspray.  I had heard that this movie was gross, but I tend to like gross-out films so I decided to give it a chance.

What a mistake that was.

I watched the movie up until the famous ""Chicken scene"".  After realizing ""Oh my God, they are REALLY doing that!"", and started to literally gag, I stopped the DVD, hit my eject button, and threw this steaming pile of crap into the garbage - where it belongs.  To think that anyone is this disturbed is a scary thought.  This movie has completely blown my image of John Waters.  To make a long story short, don't buy this movie like I foolishly did.

892761,5,6304484054,"Billed as the filthiest film ever made, the truth is that PINK FLAMINGOS might be wickedly campy and seedy - - but its reputation is somewhat deceptive... mainly because John Waters is a great story teller... the film is well paced... genuinely funny  and genuinely rewatchable over and over again.  The lines are quotable... and the characters are  unforgettable... as for offensive... Yes, but as long as you're willing to ""let go"" and let yourself be pulled into John Waters' unique world (JUST til the film ends of course, if you're still in it after it ends, institutionalization IS necessary!) it is definitely a one of a kind watching experience... - - as long as you don't mind the risk of someone accusing you of having the mind of a 14 year old.  - - The soundtrack of the film and use of the music is also great...  - - It alternates between John Waters' great screenwriting (if you don't believe he's a great writer, check out his book of memoirs and essays CRACKPOT!) and ""silent"" scenes with the rock and roll music and the charactors engaging in sick antics.  I think Raymond Marbles definitely wins out over divine... he's so suave as he roams town exposing himself in the most unique of ways... As for the big irony... Though the film is best remembered for the famous dog doodie eating scene (at the very end), believe it or not, it could have been cut and the film would be equally great.

As for advice... be sure to watch the ""MAKING OF"" documentary DIVINE TRASH and you'll appreciate the film.

Though John Waters was accused of mellowing out in later years, the good news is with A DIRTY SHAME he seems to have regressed to his old self... god bless him !",1157068800,2,1678,4.533112582781457

I'm not going to give away anything, the shock value is just too good. It's fun watching this movie with people who have never seen it. I've seen reactions from people leaving the room to actual gagging! It's wonderful! But honestly, the movie is laung-out-loud funny. The dialoge, which can be a bit wordy, but never boring, is some of the best I've ever heard. Watch out for some great characters like Edie the egg lady, pure genius! Babs' birthday party scene has to be seen to be believed. You wouldn't believe me if I described it here.

The extras are great as well. John Waters hosts a good number of deleted scenes and does a great commentary giving us lots of little details about the making of this wonderful low-budget piece of art.

If you don't watch this movie you will never know what all the talk is about. Plus, you will have missed one of the greatest ""cult"" films of all time.",1156118400,3,1034,4.583783783783784
892763,5,6304484054,"Anyone reading this review has already heard what's been said about it. It's been called the stupidest, most vile, disgusting film ever made. It's written/directed/produced/filmed by cult director John Waters and it's his first film. Calling this film the most disgusting, vile film ever made is almost an understatement. I don't really regret watching this film, but there are images in this film I will never get out of my head. I haven't bothered to read a lot into just how real a lot of this stuff is, but considering this movie was made in the 70s I'm not sure how they could have simulated most of this stuff...Which truly worries me. Divine, who I'm pretty damn sure is a guy, plays...Divine, who is living under the alias of Babs Johnson and is called ""The Filthiest Person Alive,"" a title she is quite proud of. She lives with her family, consisting of her son Crackers, a live-in friend named Cotton, and her mother The Egg Lady who lives in a crib. I agree with the reviewer who said The Egg Lady needed to die, because she was annoying. She is annoying. Very annoying. Anyway, on the other side of town are Connie and Raymond Marble who are convinced that they are the filthiest people alive...And they just might be. Because they keep woman in their basement and have their servant impregnate the women and when the baby is born they sell it to lesbian couples. The woman usually die in childbirth. After the Marbles wage an all-out war on Babs and her family, it's on to see who is the filthiest person alive. Now, this movie is most definitely not for everyone. This is the most sickening, vile film I have ever seen...But it's also fascinating. I mean, some of this stuff is just so digusting I wonder how anyone could even envision any of this. John Waters actually seems like a fairly normal guy. If I knew nothing about this movie before watching it and you put John Waters and someone like Tim Burton (who, for the record, has never done anything like this movie but is a fairly discheveled looking guy) in a lineup and made me choose who I thought had written and directed it. I would choose Burton. People consider ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" to be the worst film ever made, although that has crossed over into cult classic. What I don't understand is how no one ever gave this film that ""honor."" This movie has terrible acting, that's completely noticeable and yet doesn't annoy you half as much as Keanu Reeves did in ""Dangerous Liaisons."" This is truly a bad film. But for it's originality and supreme distaste, I was hooked. You also have to realize that Waters made this film so he could make a name for himself, in that aspect...This is a really great marketing idea. If you make a film that becomes widely known as the most disgusting ever made...People are gonna see it.

GRADE: A

Quick Note-This film contains people eating dog feces, there is shots of various male and female orifices, sex scenes involving animals, Divine performing oral sex on a person, and a complete array of other disgusting things. If any of this stuff is making you queasy just reading about it, don't see this film.",1153699200,2,3122,4.593189964157706
892764,5,6304484054,"I saw this film in its 25th Anniversary version, and I loved it. Technically, it's a flawed film. The camera work is often subpar, the acting is rather amateurish (even though some of it, especially Divine, is inspired at times), and it looks cheap (it was shot on 16mm reversal film, the film stock that news crews used for their nightly broadcasts, until video came into its own). The whole film raises trash to an art form. I usually don't like films like this, but I think Waters is a great filmmaker, and really captures something hilarious and unique here. Of course, some people might be offended by some of the antics here (why I have no idea), but I think it's brilliant stuff. This was one of the original ""midnight movies"" that played to packed houses back in 1972 in places like NYC and L.A.. The final scene (Divine's dining habits) is gross, but I don't think that scene is that great. The preceding 90 minutes is much funnier and memorable than that scene. Siskel and Ebert trashed this film a lot (calling it their ""dog of the week"" on their old PBS show), and I probably wouldn't have ever saw it if I listened to them.  Since they were in my doghouse in 1997 for recommending so many awful films, and 1997 was the height of politically correct attitudes, I decided to dive into this film.  It is such a slap in the face to the PC crowd, which makes it so endearing. It has one of my favorite lines in movie history, uttered by Waters's regular Mink Stole ""there are 2 kinds of people. My kind of people, and a**holes"". This is my favorite Waters's film, along with the underrated Desperate Living and Female Trouble.",1152921600,,1634,4.47986577181208

My opinion hasn't changed sisnse the first viewing and it never will.  First off I hate to say it but somehow I do enjoy this movie..well maybe not necesarily the movie itself, but its great to watch reactions from your other friends in the room.  Of course this thing is nasty and completely depraved. THats not so bad I think.  Honsetly some scenes in Desperate Living made me want to gag more than anything in this..although I had a friend leave the room to not come back after what happens to one of the women in the pit.. THe acting is terrible, the plot makes little sense, the film quality everything really kinda sucks.

And that infamous dog poop scene happens at the very very end of the movie..lierally having NOTHING to do with anything that you just watched, just kinda thrown in there for the hell of it I guess.

Furthermore this isn't the nastiest movie ever made.. Salo and Cannibal Holocaust easily make me want to vomit more than this film ever could.

Still people should watch this movie..its like going through a hounted house or a scary looking roller coaster or the marines or something, do it jsut to say you did.

It was just disgusting. I actually felt nauseated several times throughout the viewing. Please note that I am not a prude nor do I mind unusual or even shocking subject matter in film, that isn't the issue here. But this film is just vulgarity pretending to be art. Much of it doesn't even make sense and Waters even admits it. Thank God Mr. Waters rose above this film, using it as a stepping stone towards creating films that still push the envelope but that entertain in the process. Films such as ""Polyester"" or even ""Female Trouble"" are still fun and funny and character driven. They are still rough around the edges, but they also contain hilarious ideas such as a Drive-In movie that shows ""Art"" films and serves haute cuisine (""Polyester""), or a family Christmas gone horribly wrong when a spoiled daughter doesn't receive her coveted ""Cha-Cha Heels"", killing her mother in a blind rage with the Christmas tree itself, (""Female Trouble""). I still like Waters and would not let this movie turn me away from his work completely, but I am glad I did not see ""Pink Flamingos"" first or I may never have had the pleasure of enjoying any of his other, more mature and entertaining works. New to Waters? I recommend trying some of his other films for starters. Then, if you like those, SLOWLY work you way back to ""Flamingos"".

But his career has nothing to do with Jonas Mekas, Ron Rice, Lionel Rogosin or Jim Jarmush. Water is absolutely unworried about the form; but engaged with unhealthy tendencies of the human being.

The aberrant competence is established between Divine and the Marbles. The main guests (in this beloved cult movie among whom I don' t belong) are perversion, coprology, torture, blood, overweight and visual aggressions that conform an obscure journey through an awesome exhibitionism.

As accurately Danny Peary states, that weird fascination by blood, meanness and pain around the camera would seem to delight itself may be suspicious of fascism.

Viewers should know what they are getting into, and if they can handle it, the battle for the title of ""filthiest person alive"" is pure campy fun.  I'm impressed with any movie that can still shock the pants of viewers who see it three decades after its original release.

This movie has every filthy act around--murder, rape, cannibalism, baby trafficking, kidnapping, sex acts involving live chickens, some steak stored between a transvestite's legs, a tar and feathering, incest, and execution.  Sound like something you want to see?  None of this is done in a dark or scary way, in fact, the movie is overwhelmingly bright and pink.  After an hour and a half of pure filth, Divine ends the movie with one disgusting act to prove once and for all that she is ""not only the filthiest woman alive, but also the filthiest actor alive.""

It is refreshing to see an extended family living together- three generations under one roof is rare these days (OK, so the son is in a shed, but he's pretty nearby). They all love, suport and protect each other.

I also disagree with some of the reviewers who criticized the acting. I found all of the performances (with the possible exceptions of Channing the Butler and Noodles' mother) to be top shelf. David Lochary and Mink Stole were perfect as the diabolical Marbles. And who can say Divine wasn't an excellent actor (actress?)

1.  Toothless hillbilly Cracker ""making love"" to a woman in his chicken shack, with the bloody, crushed, clawing chickens between them;

2.  Marbles' servant pleasures himself and then inseminates an unconscious abductee with a dropper;

3.  Mr. Marbles exposes himself to women in the park with a salami tied down under, and eventually gets a taste of his own medicine from a transsexual;

4.  A naked scrawny hairy Afroed hippie dances around on a stage and bends over, showing everything for at least one full minute;

5.  Transvestite Divine orally fellates her supposed son Cracker while he cries ""Oh, Mama!""

6.  Divine plunks up fresh doo from a foo-foo dog and gnashes it in her teeth, winking glamour shots at the camera.

892895,5,6304484054,"Wow!, where shall I begin?! Here in the Netherlands there's also a movie industry, but of course not like the multi billion dollar industry like Hollywood.
Therefore, to draw viewers and to compete with the mainstream, Dutch movies are kinda different. Different in a way, that they often have nudity and/or violence in a way like; here it is, no beating around the bush, but you just see everything, no holds barred.
Luckily, we are a free country too, and very tolerant, so movies are in no way cut or censored; the way it should be. One should choose oneself what he wants to watch, and no censorship should make that decision.
Well, that information provided, I thought I saw it all already in Dutch movies. And American movies are unfortunately often censored, and it kinda looked to me as if it was very prude.
I often don't understand it, because on the other hand, the prude country (NO OFFENCE!) which cuts movies, is also selling guns on every street corner, and has the biggest x-rated industry in the world.
No offence in any way, by the way; don't get me wrong, I'm a USA-fan!
Anyway, as I said, that provided, it was absolutely unbelievable to see this movie coming from the USA.
I just couldn't believe my eyes, especially when I think that this was released in the 70s.
I got one shock after another when watching it, but I just love it.
This is a prove of freedom of speech, one who puts everything in a movie he wishes, without censoreship or what so ever.
Just great! This is FREEDOM!
Besides the ""shocking"" parts, it was just hilarious and I really loved it.
A great soundtrack and a strange story. An unpredictable story, and not a story that has been used already in 100 other movies.
Divine plays the filthiest person alive, but one couple isn't happy she got that title, and they start a ""war"" with Divine, to show the world that they are the filthiest people alive.
This male/female couple kidnaps girls, enpregnate them, and sell the babies to lesbian couples.
Haha, how does John Waters think of it! Absolutely brilliant.
Besides that, the male of the couple is a flasher too.
That was the first shocking scene. He flashes 2 girls, and there's no ""covering"", you just see it hanging there, with even a salami tied to it, haha.
Divine, is filthy, lives in a trailer with her family, including a huge and fat mother who sits in a babybox in her underwear eating eggs all day. Hilarious. Her son, likes to make love not only to girls but simultaniously to chickens. Also this is a -no holds barred- scene.
The only thing that offended me, was that Waters used real live chickens and killed them just for this scene. Okay, he's right in the extras on the DVD, saying that this chicken would have been killed anyway, because they don't land in our meals due to having a heart attack, but nevertheless, I don't think this will make it right to kill animals just for entertainment, so that was the only thing I hated about this movie.
Hence this was the second shocker.
The third shocker was very strange and unbelievable. At Divine's party, a male dancer strips, and shows a very odd ""talent'; well, if I tell it like it is, this review won't make the site due to censorship, and I don't really know how to say it delicate either. Well, I'll try; picture you making a fish mouth with your lips, and opening and closing it; well, this dancer opens and closes another ""mouth""-like muscle.
The fourth shocker was as hilarious as shocking. The flasher chose a new victim to flash; a pretty girl; he walks to her, and flashes again, and again you can see everything, but then; this girls takes out a [...] and jiggles with it to the flasher, he jiggles his ""salami"", and -here comes the shocking and hilarious part- this pretty girl, lifts up her skirt, and shows her thing, but it isn't what one expects, she also shows her ""salami"", whahaha, it turns out to be a transsexual. The flasher is just as surprised as the viewer and runs away screaming; hahaha; I couldn't believe it, I was shocked, but I was also on the floor laughing! Utterly great!
The final shocker, was for real and not that hilarious in my eyes, this scene was just absolutely gay.
No offence to gay people, but I just don't enjoy seeing the ""deed"". Divine and her son, entered a home, and trashed it, they got so exciting by trashing it (trashing in this case was licking the furniture,haha), that they wanted each other, so Divine gives her son a BJ (you know, the oral thing), and again, you'll see it completely; then, thinking that Divine was really a man, this scene was a bit disgusting to me.
But the rest of the hilarious scenes make up for it.
And the final scene, is truly unbelievable. Divine, proves once and for all, she is the filthiest person alive, by eating fresh laid dog poo. This is for real! I watched this scene, studied and analyzed it, believe me, it is real. You'll see the dog laying it on the pavement, she picks it up, while the dog is still standing there in his position, and in one camera movement you'll see it going from her hands into her mouth. This scene in shot in one movement, without any editing, so in no way they could have replaced the poo by chocolate for instance; it is therefore real poo she's eating, and she even has to gag from it, while ""acting"". So shocking and unbelievable that it is FUNNY and HILARIOUS.
Over all, I recommend this movie to anyone, who is in for a cheap laugh!
Enjoy it!",1104883200,3,5428,4.48938321536906
892896,4,6304484054,"John Waters utterly rejects everything decent and clean and entertains us in the process.  You can loathe this film, but you can't loathe Divine - he/she's a character like no other.  While not a professional actor/actress, she gets plenty of mileage out of her sheer gusto and enthusiasm, and at the end we get to see just how devoted she is to the art of being putrid.

The supporting cast eats up their depraved roles, multiplying the fun.  Miss Edie, the Marbles, Crackers, Cotton, and Channing are hilariously vile and grotesque people and I love them all.  The awful camerawork, clumsy direction, and scratchy soundtrack  add to the scuzzy experience that many won't want to relive but that none will ever forget.  This blunt satire really wolloped middle America back in the day, and it obeyed my foremost requirement of satires - annoy conservatives.

The really interesting thing about this flick, though, is that the underground world glimpsed here has more or less become mainstream America.  Turn on the TV and you'll see what I mean.

The plot is rather insignificant as far as the movie goes. Two families (this term is used loosely, I mean how could Divine give birth to Crackers) try to prove that they are indeed the filthiest people alive. Mean pranks are followed by arson and murder as the conflict escalates.

The movie is utterly hilarious. The humour is typical of John Waters and his method of bad taste. He manages to make things like slavery, rape, and murder things that we would laugh at instead of be repulsed by. What it comes down to is that John Waters may be one of the reasons that Americans are desensitized to violence and sex. This movie not only crosses every boundry but takes a crap on it then eats it and then spits it out. (Yeah that was in the movie too)

892980,3,6304484054,"In my opinion, John Water's movies have always been smarter on paper than most give him credit for. All of his work skewers the establishment was well as some of its offshoots and although intended to be shocking (in many instances just for the sake of being able to do so), my favorite moments generally involve the amazing Mink Stole and when John Waters in a very matter of fact fashion throws in something absolutely jaw-dropping as if it were just another scene.
On one hand you'll have people who will find Waters' early work to be too repulsive to watch and on the other extreme, you'll find others who worship his movies without any reservation and reject any critique as a sign that people just don't get it. My perspective is a little different as after watching Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, and Desperate Living, my view is that while the ideas continue to be as fresh as they were made in the mid to late 1970's, his early work is much funnier when taken in little dozes rather than full length movies. Although, many may disagree I find Desperate Living to be his early best, while Female trouble is highly overrated. Pink Flamingos falls somewhere between the two.
There are scenes in Desperate Living that had me laughing so hard that I cried. In fact, the first half hour of the film is absolutely hilarious. Every scene involving Jean Hill who plays the hilarious Grizelda Brown and/or Mink Stole who plays the crazed Peggy Gravel, is a gag waiting to happen. There is a scene that takes place after something horrible happens (like I am going to tell you what happened) when Peggy is driving away with Grizelda that is worth the price of owning this movie. Said scene has Mink Stole going off like a madwoman regarding her hatred of nature, and it never fails to surprise me how funny she is. As happens with most of Waters' early films, it ultimately runs out of steam and starts relying too much on shock value and by now almost any Waters fan is hard to shock visually so it better be funny too. Desperate Living is my favorite early John Waters film, although many find it to be his most grim and depressing.
Female Trouble is one of the early Waters movies that most fans tend to like, and I just did not like it at all. Of course no John Waters film can ever be made without having hilarious moments, but they are far and few in between and I was mostly bored. Mink Stole as usual steals every scene that she is in and she does a variation on her ""I hate nature"" soliloquy from ""Desperate Living,"" this time involving humans. Although I could not get enough of Edith Massey as the egg lady Pink Flamingos or as Queen Carlotta in desperate living, her role in Female Trouble made me feel for her as I was not laughing with her or could not bring myself to laugh at her. While she has her moments and awesome potty mouth, Waters (possibly without meaning to) takes her costumes to a point where you want to hug her instead of laughing. Divine has the opposite effect as the cruder and ruder that she is, the more that I loved her in this movie.
Pink Flamingos, which is Waters' breakout movie, without a doubt uses shock value more than any of his subsequent films. It is supposedly centered around defining who is the filthiest person alive in Waters' beloved Phoenix, Maryland. Since this was Waters' first fully realized early picture, he went for the jugular in trying to get away with as much gross out material as possible. The story, as is the case with Female Trouble, is not worth following and starts to get old quickly, but there are MANY scenes that will shock the numbest person alive. In many instances, the shock is not a bad thing as my motto is if it's funny, bring it on. Edith Massey as the egg lady is so funny that I can't help seeing her scenes over and over again. There are little touches as the manner in which Divine steals some ham, or apparently throwaway scenes involving dealing drugs and a baby selling ring, that are too funny to describe.
In a nutshell, I think that John Waters in hilarious and is responsible for some of the funniest movies of our time (as is the case with Serial Mom, just to name one), but these early exercises in guerilla filmmaking work better as boundary pushers than fully realized self contained movies. Those who enjoyed Jackass - The Movie, said movie would probably never have seen the light of day if it were not for John Waters, and although some may wish that such were the case, I for one think that Jackass - The Movie is one of the funniest movies ever. Part of that success is due to Johnny Knoxville not attempting to create a linear narrative or a storyline but intertwining bigger and smaller ideas just for the sake of making us laugh. Maybe it was not a choice at the time, but all of Waters' early movies would have worked much better with extensive editing and bypassing the narrative to focus on being funny.
I give Desperate Living 3.5 stars, Pink Flamingos 2.5 stars, and Female Trouble 1.5 stars. New Line home videos has released several two-packs of John Waters' films, but none that I know of that have Desperate Living and Pink Flamingos on the same package.",1082246400,2,5168,4.498936170212766

I have seen some seriously unsettling, gross out pics (Bad Taste, Dead Alive) that got it right. And I have seen some disturbing cinema (Eraserhead, Happiness) that was very thought provoking and had a strong point. But this Waters' anti-film is none of the above. It has no point and looks like a very cheap misfit of a porn movie that could't figure out how to get right down to the business at hand. Even the acting in a terrible b-flick like ""Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid"" was atleast slightly entertaining. I've seen home videos with a better dramatic edge and more humor than this stink fest.

""Pink Flamingos"" defines bad taste. The narrative involves two families that attempt to prove to each other that they are ""the filthiest people alive."" In the process, you see people slobbering on furniture and eating dog feces. Need I say more?
Bad acting reaches a new low with this film. The worst of the cast is arguably Edie ""the egg lady."" Her horrible dialog delivery still rings in my ear as I'm writing this. Ouch!
This was the first John Waters film that I ever saw. Attaining a cult status, the film played for many years at a local theatre in Los Angeles each weekend at midnight. After seeing it with a friend on one such occassion, I swore that I would never see another John Waters film.

893037,4,6304484054,"Before he started making more respectable mainstream movies like HAIRSPRAY, John Waters made this wonderfully trashy, sick and hilarious film. Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in an obscure trailer park with her bizarre family, including an obese woman in a child's playpen and lays claim to the proud title of Filthiest Person In The World, however Babs soon finds her position challenged by  the repugnant Connie and Raymond Marble and soon an all out war ensues.
Some of the delightfully repulsive moments in PINK FLAMINGOS include Divine eating dog doodoo, a guy making love to a chicken and a contortionist who can do astounding things with his bungholio. You'll laugh till you puke. Though IMDB  has PINK FLAMINGOS listed as banned in NZ it's still available with an R18 rating, which is brilliant. PINK FLAMINGOS is probably one of the greatest cult movies of all time, mercifully, the SPCS were probably absorbed in their bibles or disrupting an art exhibition when PINK FLAMINGOS was passed.

But unlike the general consensus of fans here, I just don't see what is so hilarious about Pink Flamingos.  I understand it is a low-budget, over-the-top, gross-out publicity stunt, but I didn't find it particularly clever.  Pecker is truly hysterical and Serial Mom is one of the darkest, funniest movies I have ever seen, but Pink Flamingos' is merely one lewd freak show stunt after another.  Shocking?  Definitely.  Memorable?  You bet.  Witty or imaginative?  Not to me.  Yeah, the chicken sex made me laugh; but then there's a fat lady in a playpen, a few characters have red or blue hair, we get some rectal gymnastics and the loud drag queen eats poodle feces for no apparent reason.  These and most gags range from mildly weird to just plain annoying to obtusely gross to predictably juvenile.  You will certainly cringe and have lots to talk about after, but I just don't think you'll be in stitches during this movie.  If you like Tom Green, you'll love Pink Flamingos.

The chicken sex scene still makes me nautious so I fast forwarded through that but surprisingly enough I could watch everything else with only the occasional vomit reflex or an ""Awww! that's disgusting!"".

893044,4,6304484054,"Like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on Pearl Harbor, every one who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it--and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones. Filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around, PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of ""The Filthiest People Alive.""  Just how filthy can they be?  Plenty: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and I guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it.
The cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it.  The star, of course, is Divine... and to describe Divine as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair, and BIG expressions--she is the Charleton Heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny.  Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the ever-appalling Edith Massey as members of Divine's family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge Divine's status.
It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in for a major jolt.  But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, this is the movie for you.  Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case.",1013558400,3,2230,4.809399477806789

However, the fact of the matter is that this film does hold moral standards and it only rebels against them on a micro level. No matter how offensive and disgusting this movie is it still has limits and thus falls short from being great. Still, I would definitely recommend it for those who like cult films, but if you are looking for truly anarchistic and challenging movies try getting one of the Pasolini's or Makavejev's films.",999907200,2,575,4.702970297029703

It can be described as distasteful, stomach-churning, horrible, interesting, weird, illogical, rude, sick, wonderfully vile, sly, wrong, no holds barred filth..etc.etc...but what waters did was push your eye for the obscene even further than you may have expected him to.  Was this a thin plot by Waters to boost a career and make a name for himself, probably, yes, most likely. Did he acomplish that feat?  In a gross, sadistic, vile way, yes he did.  But what he also acomplished was creating a movie that left the viewer in probably many states: confusion, sickness, shock, thought.  Thought.  The one thing that Waters did with his film was that EVERYONE that saw that movie said the next day, ""have you SEEEN that film Pink Flamingos?""  It is a movie to talk about, even if it might be the most disgusting, vile, unabashedly distasteful piece of cinema you have ever seen in your life.  But that's what Water's was aiming at.  ""Did you see what he did with that chicken?"" People talked about it, the images in the movie were recanted,lamented, and pondered over with shakes of the head.  Wow.  Waters did seem to have a fetish for the obscure, and especially for ""trash culture"" in the '70s... But this is the film that made him, this is the film that is now a cult classic... this is the film talked about. Although it may not be a film masterpiece, it did do something, it made people talk, it made people feel a lot of things, and it made a name for John Waters....",993427200,4,1569,4.587813620071684

While I'm not as enthusiastic about this RHPS-style movie as most people, I do think it sets the bar high for grossing out & offending people, and clearly had an influence on modern-day pranksters like the Farrelly brothers and the ""South Park"" team.  At first, the concept of watching rednecks in their natural habitat is funny (the chicken-sex scene had me cringing and laughing), but after a while, the movie's shock techniques start to wear out, partly because Divine (in addition to being a horrible actress? actor?) is such an annoying, grotesque presence.  I realize it may have been Waters' goal to glamorize this nasal pig, but 108 minutes of her shtick is enough to drive anyone up the wall.  But even with her, ""Pink Flamingos"" has some of the most unique, shocking comedy bits ever put on celluloid, so I recommend it.",987379200,4,964,4.932098765432099

Is this movie an artful expression or simply garbage? If you enjoy being shocked and experience weird images, watch this movie and chalk it up as an experience. Yet I find it hard to believe anyone can call this movie ""great"", and believe it. Cult movies either exist becuase they appeal to a select group of people, offer a hidden prize, or are fodder for the ""I'm so strange, you can't understand or appreciate me"" type.
I have a dark sense of humor, but the fat baby-women has a shrieking voice that simply grates on your nerves. The chicken fettish is kinda funny, but the filth is a little too thick in this film. It seems to be shock value, since there is no sense to the wreck John Waters calls a movie.

I'm appalled by the fact that people ( if you can really call them that) actually enjoy this movie! What's wrong with our society! I've never seen a movie as disgusting,offensive, and vile before in my life! I've seen several movies since growing up. And this one is the worst! Last year there was a lot of controversy reguarding the movie ""American Beauty"", a lot of people saw it as a disturbing, crude and offensive film. What planet am I living on!!!!!! How can someone praise this movie and bash ""American Beauty""!!??? Everyone who's seen this movie seemed to be either drunk, or on pot at the time while watching the movie, and maybe some did both. Let me tell you something, if you have to go on pot or drink a six-pack in order to ""enjoy"" a movie, how good can the movie be? I'm embarrassed and disgusting with and for people who like this movie. While watching this ""movie"" I never gagged before so much in my life. I put the fast forward button into full use. As stated before by other reviewers, the ""story"" is about two group of ""people"" vying for the title ""filthiest person alive"", and of course, who wouldn't want that title? This movie has left such disturbing images in my head, I don't know if I'll ever get rid of them! I think, we may have found an easy way to give people an I.Q test. If they like this ""movie"", they should be locked up in a metal institution. Those that don't like this ""movie"" should be awarded for the character and morals. But I'm sure that's a foreign word to people who like this ""movie"", the word morals. One of my regrets is that I'm unable to give this ""movie"" zero stars. Which is what it truly deserves.

The writing is great, and the conviction through which the dialogue is delivered by the performers totally sells it; elevates it, even. Divine in particular commands every scene she's in and manages to be outlandish in a way that is both repulsive and hypnotic. No, it isn't perfect. The pacing is a bit odd, the camerawork is beyond basic and the colors are drab. However, these shortcomings lend an endearing quality that only adds to the trashiness that the film gleefully revels in.
