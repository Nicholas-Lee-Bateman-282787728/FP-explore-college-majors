(and yes i am aware of many of them...theyre awful)... i never thought it possible that a SCRIPTED, unambitious, budgetless attempt at a homemade horror film made by people youve never met or know could ever be entertaining; in fact, HYSTERICAL...and yet it has been done. if you have what it takes to see past Death Nurse's (parts 1 and 2) obvious shortcomings, and find that you share the same sense of humor this group of people share as a unit...you're in for a nice surprise. the film is absolutely ridiculous both intentionally and unintentionally and really cant be put into words. it just has to be seen to be believed. Nurse Mortley will take good care of you...especially if you're in need of a good laugh. RIP priscilla!",1360886400,2,1748,4.810631229235881
8522320,4,B007VUJX0K,"Death Nurse by any definition is simply a film that die hard collectors must have! It's a rare little gem from the 80's that involves a deranged nurse along with a doctor I believe, whom both work from a residence not an actual office (pretty seedy) and specializes in TB in one case in which Nurse Mortley is sure it's the worst case she's ever scene. Scalpels look like steak knives and face masks look like dish towels and of course blood looks like a condiment. These are all reasons to see this film, to be in utter shock at what was considered releasable once video became such an easy way to make a film. So sit back and watch as the two wackos go through patient after patient in order to collect insurance money (as if they would be entitled to any money after an investigation was done). Oh it appears this patient with a cough now has 18 stab wounds, we better prepare a report so that the seedy doctors office that is actually held at someones residence is properly paid! If all this isn't enough to have you click ""buy new"" I don't know what would? After you pee yourself laughing while shaking your head at the same time, believe it or not there is a sequel! Yes! Death Nurse 2!",1360368000,3,1192,4.325892857142857
