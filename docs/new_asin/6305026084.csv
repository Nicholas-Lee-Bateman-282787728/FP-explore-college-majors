7881855,3,6305026084,I felt that this movie was very boring. I kept loosing interest in it. There are other movies of Michael's that are better then this one. Hardly any of his ninja moves did he do. It just wasn't one of his better movies.,1407974400,,219,4.116279069767442
7881856,5,6305026084,"This movie is pretty much the Citizen Kane of military action movies.  With veteran actors Michael Dudikoff and Tone Loc, the action takes a back seat to the rich characters they bring to life.  But not by much.  The accuracy and attention to detail in the action sequences give it an almost documentary feel.  It's like Saving Private Ryan but with a plot ripped straight from the headlines.  I've talked to thousands of ex-special forces members about this movie and they said they now use this as a training tool.

The tension is riveting and the action non-stop.  Except when it stops.  It's a roller coaster ride of emotion that will leave you feeling drained by the time the credits roll.

Pros:  State of the art weapons and tactics
  Once in a lifetime pairing of two of America's most celebrated actors (kind of makes the Expendables feel like low budget ripoff)

Cons:  It's only 93 minutes long.  Would have been better with a runtime closer to 300 minutes.",1379721600,,968,4.678571428571429
7881857,3,6305026084,"I almost always enjoy movies of this genre, but this one is just a bit too quirky and uneven for my taste. It seems to jump around from situation to situation without the viewer really knowing what's going on.",1366588800,,209,4.384615384615385
