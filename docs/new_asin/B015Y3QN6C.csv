7454051,4,B015Y3QN6C,"A special gem from the director of The Maid. The film builds up nicely to its crescendo ending. A truly innovative picture with interesting things to say about people's relations in the 21st century. It is a poignant look at the new normal ""gay family"" which can't escape the alienation, boredom, disappointments and anger ever so present in the metropolitan life of person of every sexual persuasion. Brave film.",1450915200,,413,5.0
7454052,3,B015Y3QN6C,"Nasty Baby is about two people trying to have a baby together even though they are not a couple. Polly (Kristen Wiig) is single and Freddy (Sebastian Silva) lives with his boyfriend, Mo (Tunde Adebimpe) in a walk-up on a quiet Brooklyn block. Polly and Freddy are best friends and Freddy, an artist, is fascinated by the idea of creating a replica of himself. When they learn that Freddys sperm count may be too low, Polly asks Mo if he would serve as donor. Though Mo is a more private person than Freddy, he just might be open to persuasion.

Written and directed by Sebastian Silva, Nasty Baby places center stage the new normal family. The characters are living a Brooklyn version of the good life. They enjoy their work, pleasant friends, good food, and leisure activities. Racism, homophobia, and money occasionally arise, but the central trio and their friends fall back on irony and political correctness to defuse any threats to their happiness.

The films humor derives from the awkwardness that occurs when unspoken boundaries are crossed. There are several surprises along the way, with awkward misunderstandings becoming horrifying as gentle comedy is overshadowed by satirical observation.

Extras on the DVD release include commentary with Sebastian Silva, Kristen Wiig and Tunde Adebimpe; behind-the-scenes featurette; and photo gallery.",1450569600,,1353,5.197247706422019
7454053,4,B015Y3QN6C,I liked this film. Don't get all of the criticism about the surprise (not really) ending or cadence.,1449878400,,100,4.611111111111111
7454054,2,B015Y3QN6C,"One has to appreciate the lengths Sebastian Silva goes to create interesting movies, even if they don't always come together as they should. A couple of years ago he was here at Sundance with a twinbill featuring Michael Cera, the drug dramedy Crystal Fairy, and the psychological thriller Magic Magic. Silva's style has always been somewhat free-flowing and loose, although to say his movies are fun would be an overstatement. There's always a dark strand beneath the surface that Silva seems anxious to explore, but usually he weaves it in better than he does in Nasty Baby, a refreshingly progressive but bipolar dramedy starring Kristen Wiig.

Silva's put himself in minor roles before but this time he proves a charming lead as Freddy, a Brooklyn artist who just wants to have a child with his African-American boyfriend, Mo (Tunde Adebimpe), using their best gal friend Polly (Wiig) as the surrogate. They make for an endearing melting pot of a trio and that the film accepts their relationship at face value without explanation is one of its best qualities. Months have gone by without Polly getting pregnant and with time running out, the only other reliable candidate is Mo, who seems unsure about the whole deal.

While the pregnancy issue is front and center, other issues are bubbling beneath the surface. Mo's family isn't totally on board with the idea, it seems, and Freddy's new art show, in which he plays an actual baby, isn't going as he expected. But more immediate is the presence of Bishop (Reg E. Cathey), the neighborhood loon who seems harmless enough at first; selling junk on the street and babbling nonsense. Soon he's running a leaf blower at all hours of the day and accosting Polly on the street. For Freddy, who already has an anger management problem, Bishop is a problem that needs to be dealt with, and how he's dealt with sparks a second-half turn that few will see coming and even fewer will understand.

Largely improvisational, the film benefits from the presence of Wiig to anchor the ensemble. She seems truly at home in the relaxed atmosphere Silva has created, and the film hums along at its own casual rhythm. Silva has a natural presence in front of the camera and he clicks with Adebimpe, who some may remember as the loyal and comforting fiance in Rachel Getting Married. While the performances remain solid throughout, including a welcome supporting turn from Mark Margolis as their wizened gay neighbor, the editing and camerawork leave a lot to be desired. Haphazardly shot and cut, minor characters appear and disappear at random, like Alia Shawkat in a wasted role as Freddy's assistant.

But man, does this thing ever turn dark. That wouldn't be so bad if it had some connection to what came before or was given more time to develop. As it stands we're left wondering what the heck the whole thing was about. The actors remain committed to their roles despite the dramatic shift but there's no getting around that it feels like a completely different movie, and not one anybody is likely to enjoy as much as the first half. It's always worthwhile to get a new project from Silva because he's a filmmaker who likes to push new boundaries, but it's a risk that didn't pay off this time.",1448323200,3,3237,4.795698924731183
7454055,1,B015Y3QN6C,"We're giving this film one star for the family dinner scene, followed by the 'act of conception' scene. Beyond these two scenes, this film is full of unlikeable, navel-gazing characters who think it a good idea to make a mini-me. The unexpected turn of events in the last one third of the film is confounding in the most terrible way. What is the point? To see how far these characters will go to protect themselves in a petty feud with a mentally ill neighbor? Kristen Wiig has made some very interesting films; Welcome to Me, for example, handled the issue of mental illness with such grace and complexity. In comparison, ""Nasty Baby"" is shockingly disappointing.",1448064000,5,665,4.791304347826087

7454057,4,B015Y3QN6C,"The movie goes in a really unexpected direction in the final third of the film in a way that won't work for anybody just expecting some nice harmless entertainment, but it's a sharp daring move that more film artists in this country could benefit from. It's refreshing to see risk-taking filmmaking rather than simply trying to coddle any and all audiences, and this viewer had a blast as a result.",1447372800,,398,4.7

7454063,2,B015Y3QN6C,"I wanted to like this more. The general premise has been experienced as I too listened to my best friend's trials and tribulations, trying to adopt or surrogate his and his husband's baby.  It was refreshing to see that they were best friends and were planning to raise the child together. Besides that it was a too long movie about nothing to really grab interest. Kristen Wiig's character was bland and unkempt, unemployed?, not groomed and looking like she just rolled out of bed. One shot has her walking away with horrible bed head and all I could concentrate on was, ""I don't think there is one gay man that would ever want to 'mate' with that laundry basket.""  Really loose side stories and the ""art piece"" the one character is trying to get placed in the gallery is truly uneventful, unremarkable and kinda gross. AND the last climactic event had nothing to do with anything remotely pertinent to the story and the ensuing mayhem was entirety unfounded and unnecessary. I like Kristin Wiig, but anymore blunders like this should have her storing her pennies in a one room basement hovel, similar to Bishop's digs...When it's over, plan on cleaning your place and washing all of your laundry just to clear the wrinkles and frump etched into your brain.

This movie had me in tears of joy in the second act, and then totally freaked out in the third. It's definitely not a comedy or a feel-good movie, it's an art house picture with a weird and scary twist, but the characters are all likable and true to themselves to the end. Don't listen to the reviews by people who were put off and not expecting such a dark story, it's really well written and well acted.",1472256000,,525,4.36734693877551
7454066,3,B015Y3QN6C,"Great performances, direction, and it felt really natural. I'll watch anything with Tunde since he's one of my favorite singers, and he's a genuinely good actor. I appreciate extreme cinema, and I wanted to like the third act, but I could see it coming from a mile away. I can think of a few different, equally dark directions the film could have gone that would have kept it insular to these characters' relationship and would have had an actual point, from a character development standpoint. Not to give too much away, but I just didn't buy the plotting of the final event, and I feel like these characters definitely could have called the authorities and wouldn't have been at fault for anything. They could have at the very least fudged the facts a little to suit their case and gotten away with it.

I will say, the trailer was one of the best I've ever seen and I was absolutely dying to see this movie, so it was a bit of a let down.",1470787200,2,941,4.408045977011494

Silva is clearly a creative force who is able to capture an original vision. Not a misstep in the piece. Great storytelling with deep subtexts that touch on many of the pressing issues of the day - but the film never panders or pontificates; the subtext always stays right where it belongs, bubbling just beneath the surface. Silva reminds me a little of McQueen, but IMO, Silva has more control of the narrative. I think people will look back on this film and say, How'd we miss that one?

7454130,1,B015Y3QN6C,"For some reason I though this movie was going to be about a gay couple who decide to have a baby which their elderly neighbour either homophobic, against mixed race couples, non traditional parent baby raising or was some sort of religious extremist would more and more violently act out against. But that's not what the movie is. Instead it's a very Indie feel cheaply made looking movie, that doesn't really have any likable characters at all. Has a lot of pointless boring talking and scenes that are more for we went there value than add anything to the story such as talking to his mother on the phone while sitting down and using the toilet. The main character is an illegal immigrant who is making some film called Nasty Baby where he acts like a baby. He has arranged for his female friend to carry and give birth to his baby. Only it's bad news for him, he has a very low sperm count. So his female friend suggests his boyfriend steps up to the plate, this guy is a bit more hesitant on the issue. Meanwhile a mentally disabled man is doing increasingly annoying things in the street. When the female friend is grabbed by him on the way to their apartment where her pot plant is wrecked, she tells the boys she was sexually assaulted. Tension will reach an all time height until someone crosses a line you can't undo.

7454132,3,B015Y3QN6C,"For better or worse, I've decided to watch every available film in which Kristen Wiig has a substantial role. Tall orders aside, Nasty Baby was not an unpleasant experience. There's at least a couple of reasons people seem to be turned off by this film:

 One of the protagonists (if not *the* protagonist) is a conceptual performance artist of the sort that is easy to mock (Trey Parker and Matt Stone would have a jolly good time with Nasty Baby). He is portrayed by the writer and director of the film. The current top review above derides the characters as ""navel-gazing,"" which may not be inaccurate in regards to this particular character. That his citizenship status is murky makes Nasty Baby all the more uncomfortable for some viewers.

 Two men are trying to have a baby. Not everyone's idea of entertainment; furthermore, those who wanted to see Nasty Baby precisely because of this plot may feel betrayed when they get more than they signed up for.

But c'mon, they gave you clues ahead of time. Did you think twice about the title of the movie? Look at the movie poster art: the little kid is sticking his tongue out... who's this directed at? At the audience. It's a challenge. Nasty Baby challenges you. I like a challenge. A goal of Nasty Baby is to force you out of your box. Do not expect a conventional flick. The pace is not brisk, but this is intentional. If you are attentive for the millisecond after the movie title flashes on the screen, you'll see the words ""Based On A True Story."" I am fascinated, and left wondering how much is fiction.

To the critic who proclaims the characters to be ""navel-gazing"": is that not what Americans are best at? Kristen Wiig's character works in healthcare: is that navel-gazing? And let's be honest: most viewers say they care about the welfare of mentally ill people of the lowest socioeconomic status, yet are only paying lip service and will probably never meet such a person in their life.
I of course am not defending the violence in Nasty Baby, but I am defending the efforts of accomplished actors in the flick such as Mark Margolis, Reg E. Cathey, and Neal Huff, as well as the spirit of socially honest DIY filmmaking.",1457136000,,2188,4.640826873385013

Actually, I know there is no way to redeem what happens in this film. No one wants to watch an innocent character engage in gratuitous and unexplainable violence. It is the ultimate horror. Actually, I'm not going to finish this film. Refusing to watch the ending is my way of cleaning myself from what I've seen so far. Just like the characters try to get rid of the blood so I'm trying to get rid of this yucky feeling. I feel gross and I wish I didn't watch this. It started off so innocently.

The film's depictions of gays was fair balanced real and very raw. On an Uncomfortable Watching With the Folks scale 1 to 10, I'd say a high 9.

This movie was okay. I appreciate that this is not a feel good gay movie, because those are just awful, but I found the character development lacking, and I didn't really believe any of the emotion displayed by the characters. I kind of wish it had been filmed in Spanish and in Chile I probably would have ADORED it then.

Also i was so pissed that the actual nasty baby art installation turned out so horribly. The original idea that Sebastian had explained in the beginning of the movie was so much better. The art project ended up being cute and stupid, instead of clever and poignant. and Sebastian's character had the nerve to be upset about that or not see that? It was either a poorly written reaction or maybe his character really was just a s***ty artist all along.",1451260800,,867,4.481012658227848
