7826992,2,6302484308,"Not going far beyond his greatest role as Grandpa Munster in the iconic television show, the always kooky Al Lewis stars as a vampire (surprise!) in this pseudo kid's film. It is clearly made for kids, but it has some odd directorial choices for purely children's entertainment (e.g. cursing, theft of holy water, kids stealing a huge bottle of gin for their grandpa, etc.) Made in New Zealand, ""My Grandpa is a Vampire"" is a film that seems much longer than its 98-minute running time. A kid from California, Lonny, and his friend figure out Lonny's grandfather is a vampire because his image is missing in family photos. Hijinks naturally ensue.

The boys love Grandpa Cooger because he's magical and can make lights turn on while he dances to ""The Magic Flute"" (this really happens). All that dancing gets the nearly 300-year old vampire to keel over and die. The boys are upset, naturally, and their Aunt Leah (Pat Evison, the poor man's Hyacinth Bucket wannabe) and her grumpy boyfriend don't make anything better being the dowdy parental-role buffoons. So what kind of wake does a vampire have? One with the beautiful hymn ""Abide With Me"" playing in the background while illicit candy eating with suggestive tongue movements make everyone generally uncomfortable. This trend of using genuinely beautiful public domain music is unfortunately reprised later in the film with the worst kid's talent show trumpet solo version of ""How Great Thou Art"" imaginable. Sacrilege.

Anyway, Grandpa is dead and while lying in his coffin the boys pry up his gums and find his elongated teeth, confirming their suspicions. The boys engage in a wheezy bit of musical mayhem at an organ and find they can't stop; with the coffin belching smoke, Grandpa is back and immediately takes the boys flying, which reveals the most hilarious special effects I have seen in a while. Talk about cheap. New Zealand, have you no shame? Although the flying effects are great, the fake sleepwalking scene is the dramatic peak of the movie, though unnecessary preteen girls dancing is also a highlight. (Not really.) The boys are helping Cooger hide out in a cave, but he wants an upscale dining experience which leads to some of the most obvious product placement in film history when they go to a McDonald's and mayhem ensues. (What on earth did McDonald's think they were getting out of this?) The film largely gets resolved at a horrible ""talent"" show which features an impromptu appearance of Al Lewis as the tap-dancing vampire (this one scene almost makes sitting through this movie worth it). I won't tell you how the film is resolved (not that you couldn't guess anyway), but it involves free flowing tears and the mispronunciation of the word ""potato"".

Obviously Al Lewis completeists need to see this film, but it will have a scant audience outside that austere group.

I can't imagine why this is only available on VHS.",1466208000,,2905,4.8983739837398375
