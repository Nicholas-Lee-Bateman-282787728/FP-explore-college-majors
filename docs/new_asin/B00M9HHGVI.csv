6565051,5,B00M9HHGVI,"My little brothers and I watched Pee Wee's Playhouse every Saturday during my childhood.  It was great, it was hilarious, and it was Pee Wee at his best.  I remember when my mother bought the VHS tapes/boxset and we watched all those and it was hilarious again!

It is about time that this was released onto DVD because this set deserves it tons!!!!  Pee Wee is so absolutely hilarious.  For all the drama in his life his kickass coolness has been overlooked which isn't fair 'cause Pee Wee's awesome!!!  Unfortunately for me, this comes out the same day as Buffy and Smallville which means I'm going broke!!",1099267200,10,608,4.635514018691588
6565052,5,B00M9HHGVI,This is the greatest television show for children starring realife people EVER MADE! As the the guy complaining about special features... that this show is even available is a special feature. What features do you want? Mug-shots and money-shots? What more do you want? This is brilliance!,1098662400,5,289,5.170212765957447
6565053,5,B00M9HHGVI,"This years edition of the show may have all the episodes but it's lacking in the special features department.  According to the site TVSHOWSONDVD.com there will be another edition coming out in 2005.  The 2005 edition will be chocked full of heavenly goodness.  It is being produced with the help of the great Paul Reubens.  The 2005 addition will contain all 5 seasons in one handy-dandy boxed set and will.....is everybody listening..........have audio commentary with Paul Reubens himself.  Woo-hoo! If you are a hard-core fan of the show you may want to just wait till next year when the better edition is released. Until then, thanks for reading my review.",1095120000,208,661,4.972727272727273
6565054,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Pee-Wee's Playhouse has to be, hands down, the most inventive, creative and fun show that ever ran on Saturday mornings. Colorful, bright, witty...it appeals not only to kids, but to adults as well. From Miss Yvonne to Randy, the characters were all originals. A true TV classic and a welcome addition to the ever growing market of TV shows on DVD! Bravo! (was that a secret word ever?)",1093478400,7,386,4.6911764705882355

6565058,5,B00M9HHGVI,I love Pee Wee's Playhouse. I used to watch this when I was a kid.  My daughter saw a Pee Wee movie and really wanted the series.  When we watched it together it brought back such good memories of my childhood. I remembered doing the word of the day and how much chairy was a little scary.  LOL  I am so glad I found these and was able to share this memory with my daughter.  She loves them.  If you watched this as a kid you will remember a lot of the stuff.  I did.  Did you know that Cowboy Curtis was played by Laurence Fishburne?  I had no idea until I watched these with my daughter.  That was a real shocker.  If you like silly comedy and crazy antics this is for you.  These arrived on time and well packaged.,1470960000,3,717,4.00709219858156

6565097,5,B00M9HHGVI,"This DVD features 23 episodes from Season 1 and 2 of Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  The episodes are split onto four DVDs.  The show started back in 1986 and it features classic 80s fun.  I loved Pee Wee and love that I can now share it with own kids.  I remember watching the show when I was a kid and laughing hysterically. Well the show still makes me laugh and now my kids as well.

I hadn't seen the show in 20 years and had forgotten what went on in the episodes.  Its a show that I'd say is appropriate for kids, it is actually educational if you think about it!  They do a word of the day, they mention things like ""left"" and ""down"" and there are lessons of friendship, problem solving and more. There is so much packed into the episodes too that it is constantly going from one thing to another.  I put this on thinking my kids wouldn't get it or like it but they asked for more episodes!  I love the characters and silliness of the show.",1415491200,9,938,4.166666666666667
6565098,3,B00M9HHGVI,Poor reproduction I think because it uses some low rent copy protection thing. There is a wavy pattern that is noticeable. PeeWee's first season is great. He eventually runs out of good material and writing.,1414800000,,207,4.942857142857143
6565099,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us these DVD's to review!

I used to love watching Pee-wee's Playhouse as a kid.  Now that most people have forgotten about Mr. Reubens' indiscretions, what better time to introduce him to the next generation!  Each show begins with Pee-wee getting a secret word from Conky, his robot friend.  Every time somebody says that word in the show, everyone is encouraged to scream.

This show is pretty clean and often teaches good morals and manners.  There are lots of cartoons and clay animated shorts that are fun to watch.  The visuals are pretty good, with exception to the old school cartoons that showed their age twenty-five years ago.  (Yes it's been that long and I feel old now.)  Everything else is bright and colorful.

Kids of all ages are bound to enjoy this show.  I must admit that it brings back great memories.  My kids are now fans of Pee-wee Herman and we'll have to show them his movies next.

If you're looking for a silly and clean show for your kids, check this DVD set.",1414281600,13,1026,4.571428571428571

6565120,4,B00M9HHGVI,"Pee-Wee's Playhouse was on Saturday mornings when I was a little too old for it so I never really watched it much.  I'd catch a little of the show here and there, but for me, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was better.  But I definitely thought the show was well done and perfect for kids to learn and just have fun.

Fast-forward to 2010 when I have kids of my own...a boy, age 7, and a girl, almost 6.  I saw the DVD sets at a great price and figured they'd love it.  (We had watched Big Adventure before and they enjoyed it.)  They enjoy a lot of old shows that I expose them to, like The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and a slew of old cartoons.  We've watched about 10 episodes so far from set one and they really enjoy it.  It is one of the few things they actively ask for when we ask what they want to watch.  I almost always watch with them and it is definitely a fun show and it even has some lessons thrown in as well.

For the price I paid, it has been 100% worth it already.  Recommended!",1286928000,,990,4.0256410256410255

6565122,4,B00M9HHGVI,"This show deserves infinity out of 5 stars but I'm afraid I have to give the DVD sets only 1/5. I'm cutting the difference and calling it a 4. Why? The transfer quality is not what you'd hope for, unfortunately. I realize that this show was likely shot on video rather than film, given the budget and time period, but so were many of my other favorite late 80's/early 90's TV programs and I've seen better results on DVD re-releases than this, the technology exists to clean them up better than this, you could easily forget that you are watching a digital format and not VHS. More importantly, there are also no extras - no commentary, documentaries, production photos, interviews - zip, zilch, nada.

This show was the highlight of my week as a young child, is brilliantly cracked entertainment for me as an adult, and will always hold a special place in my heart, but this DVD release doesn't quite do it justice. The supposed 2005 version mentioned in other reviews has not materialized even now in 2010, but hopefully with Paul Reubens back on stage performing as Pee-Wee, renewed interest in the character will result in the better release it deserves.",1265414400,,1158,4.704433497536946

6565128,5,B00M9HHGVI,"In the early 80's, my son was in the 5-8 year range, and we watched Pee-Wee's playhouse often.  I always liked it and thought it did a great job of letting kids see themselves in an out-of-context mirror, letting them evaluate themselves and their behavior.  For instance, when Pee-Wee jumped to the conclusion that the Countess left him out of her birthday party  because the invitation didn't arrive on time, he played  the childish role so well.  It was hilarious and useful incongruity to see him portraying both the positive and negative aspects of child behavior.  The sex scandal never really bothered me, I just didn't think it was a big deal and was saddened that the episodes ceased to air.  This was a truly useful and entertaining children's show.

Now, my son is 35 and has two children aged 2 and 5.  I have purchased all the playhouse episodes, as well as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  The children, especially the 2 year old, take the lost bike in the movie very seriously.  Every time the kids visit, they want to watch Pee Wee--we usually have the movie going in one bedroom and Playhouse episodes going in another bedroom.  I consider these as life tools of equal importance to the many geometry toys purchased for them, and can't imagine having to watch other stupid children's shows all the time.  As it is, yes, there is repetition, but the innuendo stays hilarious over time, and I almost always appreciate what is on the screen, the quality of what is presented, and am ever grateful that my grandchildren have the opportunity to be exposed to these shows.  To them, Pee-Wee is real.  Much like the Harry Potter series, it takes on a life of its own that seems greater than the sum of its parts.  This was excellence in children's programming.",1237680000,,1763,4.675324675324675

OK, so may be the grownups will have more fun than the kids watching these shows,  but what's the difference, all in all, they're fun entertainment. OK, so maybe Pee Wee, (Paul Rubens), made a little mistake, no reason to all of a sudden ban his work from TV  and the movies. Let's face it, we have a former  President that did  worse than Pee Wee, and he and his old lady are more popular now  than ever.

6565131,4,B00M9HHGVI,"It was quite a trip back in 1986 when Pee Wee Herman(aka Paul Reubens) first graced our Saturday mornings on TV at 10AM to invite us in to his playhouse and his unique world. Toned down considerably from the act that he had honed in different venues(more mature material),Reubens brought a totally unique vision to his audience. Children were certainly his primary target and audience considering the time and content of his show,but he also struck home with the parents as many of his jokes and routines they  could also easily relate to. His character was an amalgam of retro kitsch and sensibilities with a modern twist. If the youngsters weren't hip to his older sayings like""I know you are but what am I?"",they very quickly did. Each show had a lesson to teach through his interaction with either his playhouse playmates and/or the frequent visitors that would come and go. He talked at his audience,never AT them,and it was all rolled and served up in such a fun and delightful manner,that it went down like a spoonful of sugar.
Reubens' character was very child-like,similar to a young mischievious boy. As a result he had an instant and eager rapport with his audience. This remained from the first eps to the last ones. That is why it is no surprise that this show won an incredible 22 Emmy Awards;no mean feat and well deserved.
In this set,the first two seasons from 1986 and 1987,Pee Wee sets the tone from the get go with ""Ice Cream Soup"",introducing most of the playhouse playmates and guests. Over time there are eps like ""Rainy Day"",teaching kids what to do when they can't go out,""Monster in the Playhouse"",which shows that being different is not a bad thing,and one of my faves ""Playhouse in Outer Space"",where we learn how to make friends the right way. There were quite a few personnel changes over the series run but its' warmth and humour never wavered.
On the technical side I didn't find this set as clear and vivid as others have written about. I have the VHS tapes(from Hi-Top and later MGM) and I find some of those at least as sharp as the eps here,if not more so. Also in some of the later eps,especially where they show clips from the older shows,some of those clips are clearer than the shows they came from!?.In fact the clarity can even vary from scene to scene within the same ep. It is possible the makers of these sets didn't use as high quality prints as others have done before. I don't know for sure,but I DO know I was disappointed in the overall look of them. I was expecting better.
Also neither of these sets has any special features whatsoever. It is just a plain release,nothing more nothing less.
In conclusion there is so much in Pee Wee's Playhouse to love and savour. Paul Reubens is to be congratulated for the splendid work he did on those shows(over 20 years ago!).But I believe these shows will(and deserve to)be around for many,many years to come,entertaining and smartly teaching countless future generations some of life's basic lessons. I would have given this release five stars(as it deserves)if it wasn't for the lack of special features and my disappointment in their transferrance onto DVD,i.e with an uneven display of clarity throughout.

I didn't mind because it's a nice break from animated stupidness and robots shooting each other.

Correct the timing if I'm wrong.
I had been looking for a movie to rent one evening while spending the time with our grandson who is 41/2. It really was a fluke that Pee Wee's Big Adventure fell into my hands and I said ""why not"". I knew nothing of him or what the DVD would be like but luckily I took a chance. My grandson loved it! I watched it with him and I was amazed at how clever and creative Pee Wee was. Since then I have purchased Pee Wee's old  TV shows which have delighted my grandson and he tells everyone that he meets at the park all about Pee Wee Herman. The kids don't know who he is talking about but the parents all remember him fondly. All I can say is that he is a very funny guy with a great imagination!",1205539200,,834,4.024096385542169

6565147,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Man, oh, man, this magically manic series takes me back! The recent Cartoon Network airing, well-intended though it was, didn't do justice to Pee-wee's Playhouse. I would have liked to have had more in the way of special features included in this anthology, but heck, that's nitpicking. Plopping down on my living room floor to watch these episodes these last couple weeks has reminded me of:

Screaming when anyone said the secret word of the day...

Wondering how Pee-wee got his bike to fly like that...

Being dazzled by all the neat colors coordinated like that inside the playhouse...

Singing the buzzy little theme song...

And it made me recall the overall joy that came along with the late, lamented institution that was Saturday morning cartoons.

It also made me crack up as I realized how the now-obvious sexual undercurrents that popped up here in and there in the series went totally over my head at eight years old!

This is an amazing and creative television program, years ahead of its time, yet it also somehow stood as a tribute to the series of its own yesteryear. It blasted through the children's'-programming-as-toy-commercial trend that was common practice in the Reagan years. (Anyone remember She-Ra Princess of Power, for instance?) And so many famous people were involved with this series, too! Phil Hartman, Lawrence Fishburne, the great Paul Reubens, of course, and occasional guest stars that make you take note when you see them.

Pee-wee's Playhouse hasn't lost much to the years, it's still a lot of fun to see, and for me and others my age, it's a jaunt back to childhood. These DVD's are a steal at twice the asking price!",1168128000,2,1659,4.858156028368795
6565148,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Pee-Wee's Playhouse box set #1 contains all 23 episodes, including two lost episodes never seen before from seasons 1 & 2. The 23 episodes are spread over 5 single sided discs and each disc comes in its own thin snap case with great artwork. The discs are coded region 0 (ntsc format). The video transfer is truly amazing and the Dolby Digital 2.0 sound is very good, but the sound should have been in digital 5.1. Overall the video and audio of this set is the best I've ever seen or heard.

The set contains no extras or bonus material; it's just the episodes the way they were shown on television. The 1988 Pee-Wee Herman Christmas special isn't included in this set either, so you'll have to buy that separately. Rumor has it that Pee-Wee Herman is going to release a complete set of his amazing show with ton's of bonus material sometime in the future. Until that day comes, this set is the only way to go. Can you say the secret word?

So when I finished volume #1, I ordered volume #2, and I watched that in pretty good timing. And I do have to say that I don't really remember these episodes to good, and I bet the reason is that this show was off of TV for a long time, and not even in repeats. At the beginning of each show, Pee-wee (or somebody else) hooks up a robot called Conky, and askes Conky for today's secret word, and then Conky would print out that day's secret word, and then that person would revel it to the camera, and anytime that you hear anybody say the secret word, you have to scream rally loud, and to test it out, they would try it on on any of the characters that you see. In most episodes it is Pee-wee that gets the secret word, which every so offten, somebody else would get it, even if Pee-Wee didn't asked him/her to get it. The cast of the human characters are Pee-Wee (Paul Reubens), Dixie (Johann Carlo), Miss Yvonne (Lynne Marie Stewart), King of Cartoons (Gilbert Lewis), Cher (Diane Yang), Opal (Natasha Lyonne), Elvis (Shaun Weiss), Captain Carl (Phil Hartman), Tito - Lifeguard (Roland Rodriguez), Mrs. Steve (Shirley Stoler), and also Rebel the mail lady, and Cowboy Curtis (Laurence Fishburne). Most of the characters left the show after season #1, but not all of them. The rest of the characters are puppets that voiced, and worked behind the secenes of this series, it might seem hard to believe that it was 20 years ago when this show debuted, but it is, the best way to see these epsiodes are on dvd, where you don't have to wait to see them on TV.",1154390400,,1971,4.358695652173913

I never forgot it and was glad to know I was not the only one to want to see it again...and again...and again.

Now I have a 3 year old who LOVES this show (we have all 5 seasons) and we all have a great time watching it together.  I asked him, ""Is Pee-wee a boy?""  and he replied, ""No, he's a man.  A silly man.""  Silly in our house is a tall compliment.  In one episode Pee-wee says, ""I'm the luckiest boy in the world!""  and our little person objected:  ""he's not a boy, he's a man!""  So there you have it.

This is one of the best shows for children I have seen, and I have watched a lot of TV shows, movies, etc. for kids, both on commercial and ""public"" TV.  This one is by far the best of them all.  It's sweet, good, smart, full of fun ideas and just the right amount of mischief to keep it interesting.  And the sets, music and archival footage are fabulous.

I find it very interesting that the dialogue of the show is written in  the same way that most children communicate.  With the exception of Sesame Street, there have been very few shows that have ever successfully attempted that.  Whatever your views about Paul Reubens personal life, it's value is clear.  In my opinion, anyone who would criticize the show based on Reubens personal life may not have children's education in mind.

6565161,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Someone else among the millions of fans will have to say which is the best version of these DVD sets. I merely grind my little axe here that I think Paul Reubens got a raw deal. It may be true that in Hollywood, as Variety columnists used to say, any publicity is good publicity, but the one exception is with kids' shows. Cartoons and kids' shows are the whipping boy for any public crusades for anything, and woe to those who venture into those shark-infested waters.

However, anyone who knows anything about the history of cartoons, which ironically is rife with scandal and expose, con men, schemers, gansters and dirty dealing, knows it has always been that way. Whatever the public persona, the behind the scenes scenario was another thing. Kids' cartoons were always made by adults, even when in the silver screen days, they weren't intended for kids (as with Looney Tunes).

Pee Wee's Playhouse didn't begin life as a kids' show, but as a special on HBO built around the comedy stylings of Paul Reuben and filled with adult innuendo. It's a tribute to his period sense and historical interest that he was able to recast it as an OK for kids show, especially at a time when trendy adults were recoiling from the real thing. The subtle campy edge drew in the adult viewers while reviving the past retro sense of early live host cartoon shows, from Pinky Lee and Soupy Sales to Captain Kangaroo. If that doesn't deserve an Emmy, what does?

Like many stressed souls in Tinseltown, Reubens made his mistakes in the camera's all-seeing eye (from which most of us are spared). But it was simply the network's concern with its reputation that got his show cancelled. How surprising--Paul Reubens is human! Consider a parallel case. When Richard Pryor was suspected of freebasing cocaine, he was ordered to produce a kids' show, and he make a great one: Pryor's Place, eagerly awaited on DVD. One guy loses his show and another guy has to make one. Is that ironic? Maybe so, but it's not unheard of in the annals of animation, and to their credit, both comedians made great kid-friendly shows. That's the real accomplishment of Pee Wee's Playhouse, and why it will outlive the too-human power struggles that are part and parcel of the history of cartoons.",1140998400,9,2256,4.720812182741117

6565163,4,B00M9HHGVI,"This tv show had a strong effect on me as a child, probably not unlike the effect Gumby had on my dad growing up as it's totally surreal in similar kind of way. The humor is unique, and the variety is astounding; from claymation and other cut-out and hand drawn animations, to the acting and puppetry, I can't imagine the chore it must've been to crank out an episode every week (although the exorbatantly long intro was proabably designed to take off some of that pressure). Truly, this is a entertainment masterpiece.

With my personal opinon about the show out the way, I have to say, I'm a little dissapointed by the dvd box sets.  Not only are they devoid of any special features (save a few ""lost"" episodes), but the editing is rather annoying as well as you cannot skip the intro theme without skipping part of the first scene. This makes watching several episodes in a row kind of tedious as, despite its quality, the intro's high pitched vocals and length will start to get to you and you'll want to start fast forwarding though it. While this is a minimal gripe it could have been avoided.

The quality of Pee-Wee's Playhouse alone demands five stars and since this is the only available dvd set it's essential for fans with some expendable income who want to get re-aquainted with it. The quality of this particular collection, however, deserves a pretty low score, but i'm going to be generous and give the collection as whole a 4/5 for the show's merits alone.",1129334400,6,1473,4.593155893536122
6565164,5,B00M9HHGVI,"These five discs come in compact packaging that give you 23 episodes of the first two seasons that will only occupy an inch and a half of shelf space.

I remember watching the first episode the first season when it first aired on TV. The dreamy opening segued into the most action packed stop motion animation, computer animation, clay animation, and regular animation that I'd ever experienced. I couldn't believe only a small half hour had transpired. This was the trippy-est  project going for 1986. Eye candy hid everywhere, in the refrigerator, the toy shelf, and the mouse hole.

And a powerhouse of talent contributed, including Larry Fishburne, Phil Hartman, and a young Natasha Lyonne. And for music the opening and closing credits were written with Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo). Additional contributions by Danny Elfman, Todd Rundgren, Dweezil Zappa, and The Residents. I especially like Danny Elfman's score in the ""Monster in the Playhouse"" episode #9.

Admittedly I am a first season diehard. In season two the Playhouse gets remodeled and we lose the toy shelf after that.

There are no special features. But this perfectly replaces my original taped video collection of episodes. Now I can easily match and entertain my friend's or my friends kid's over-stimulated minds.",1125446400,6,1282,5.144230769230769

I recently purchased both Pee-Wee's Playhouse DVD's, # 1 and # 2, and now I own all 7 seasons of this cool show. It's not nearly as childish as Barney & Sesame Street. You won't see a bunch of extremely hyperactive kids singing kiddie songs. Sure, there are children on Pee-Wee's Playhouse (the ""Playhouse Gang"") but these kids aren't as annoying as the ones on Barney, I promise you that. And Plus, they don't appear on every show. Simply put, you don't have to be an kid to enjoy this show. I'm living proof of that. I'm glad that these DVD's have got good star ratings. They deserve it. And I'm sick of people talking smack about Paul Reubens simply because of once particular incident at a pornographic theater! You know what? Who gives a darn! Paul Reubens is an adult entertainer as well as a child entertainer. I know he's now in his early 50's, but I still wouldn't mind if Paul returned to the big screen as Pee-Wee Herman one more time!

But it wasn't until now seeing them as an adult do I realize just how amazingly artful this show is! Not only was there nothing like it in 1986 but nothing EVEN CLOSE now and,if there is,it's on an obscure cable channel aired late at night. Network TV before 'The Simpsons' needed a certain influx of energy and it got it with this. This review of course refers to people who have never seen the show.",1105833600,2,728,4.5227272727272725

One important note though: The transfer to DVD is downright awful. Okay, I suppose the higher-ups didn't feel it necessary to produce a flawless transfer given the content. But at times it can be downright distracting. Portions out of focus, lines and pixelation. Ugh! There is another version coming out in 2005 packed with goodies (not the least of which is commentary by Paul himself), perhaps this will be a higher end product.

Modern techniques can clear most of this problems and we can only hope next years rumored re-release re-masters the original magnetic recordings.

Now that it's on DVD, you can relive the show in pure nostalgia.  Anyone who grew up with the show will have fun getting to know it again.  I was 10 when it first came, now I'm 28, and it's just neat-o to see the show again and say, ""Oh YEAH!  I remeber that part!  HAHAHA!""

Paul Reubens is an underrated genius, imo, who unforunately had some 'bad luck' along the way. I was sorry to see the series go, due to CBS's decision. Not many people were aware at the time that the Pee Wee's Playhouse theme song was sung by noneother than the underrated and extremely talented singer Cyndi Lauper, who used the pseudonym ""Ellen Shaw.""

6565181,5,B00M9HHGVI,"A must have for any DVD library, this groundbreaking, innovative series, Pee-wee's Playhouse, was created and produced by the genius of Paul Reubens who also stars as pop culture icon, Pee-wee Herman.  Pee-wee's Playhouse is marked by a campy sensibility and frequent use of double entendre, engaging viewers of all ages.

Incorporating clips from vintage cartoons, 3-D animation, hand puppets, marionettes, and a cast of endearingly eccentric memorable characters, Pee-wee's Playhouse is non-stop fun that might best be described as a wild mix of Mr. Rogers, The Wizard of Oz and MTV. Each episode Pee-wee Herman welcomes you into his kaleidoscope, fantasy clubhouse for adventure through a labyrinth of zany characters and sci-fi inventions. Music for the shows was provided by cutting edge artists such as Mark Mothersbaugh, Todd Rundgren, Danny Elfman, and Van Dyke Parks.

This set of DVD releases divides all 5 years (45 episodes) of the Playhouse into 2 affordable box sets (which includes 8 lost episodes) in all their side splitting hilarity sparkling in never before seen DVD clarity.

Also, check out the newly released DVD of Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas Special -- a charming, star-studded Christmas classic.

6565184,5,B00M9HHGVI,"Has there ever been a more surreal and bizarre opening sequence to any show ever made in America than that of PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE?  The Surrealists felt that one of the keys of art lay in our dreams, and the intro to this show seems like a happy nightmare of sorts.  The music, Pee Wee's odd vocal interjections, the variety of visual images, the introduction of the strange group of inhabitants living in the playhouse, all combine to announce to the would-be viewer that his was a show that wasn't going to go down any path that had been traveled by any previous show.

For five seasons beginning in 1986, this was simply one of the most amazing shows TV has ever produced.  Paul Reubens was amazing as Pee Wee Herman, literally a child with the appearance of an adult, who was a veritable encyclopedia of irritating habits that kids can assume, with every annoying verbal come a kid has ever used.  Armed with a great group of writers, a stellar cast, and some remarkable set and character designers, this show did things that no kid's show had ever done before or has done sense, though the influence on the more anarchistic line of kid's cartoons can still be detected.  I would be willing to be that the makers of shows like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS are fans of Pee Wee.

Unfortunately, this all came crashing to an end when a sex scandal caused CBS to pull the show off TV.  In fact, before the scandal they had already ceased making new episodes of the show.  But the incident did two things:  1) it caused CBS to cease showing the show in reruns and 2) killed off any future use of the Pee Wee character by Reubens.  The series has been re-released on video, though it has been out of print for a number of years, and because of the sexual nature of Reubens demise, few networks have been willing to rebroadcast the show.  Until this DVD release, PEE WEE has been more or less unavailable to the public.

Although Paul Reubens dominated the show as Pee Wee, the show is amazing today for the remarkable amount of talent on the show.  Over the years I have been amazed at how many people remember Cowboy Curtis from the show, but are unaware that Laurence Fishburne portrayed him.  Captain Carl was played by Phil Hartman before he went on to star on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE for years.  The second actor to play the King of Cartoons was William Marshall, star Blaxploitation cult classic vampire film BLACULA.  Natasha Lyonne, who played Opal, went on to additional success as a child actress and as a young adult, including THE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS and BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER.  S. Epatha Merkerson, who played Reba the letter carrier, has gone on to a long career on LAW AND ORDER.  And of course the woman who made Pee Wee's heart skip a beat, the beautiful Miss Yvonne, was played by Lynne Marie Stewart, who has gone on to plays a host of supporting roles on TV and in film.  All in all, you have to acknowledge that this was far from a normal children's cast.

But it wasn't merely the human cast that made this show so remarkable.  Inhabiting Pee Wee's playhouse were an extraordinarily odd group of denizens, from Pterri the Pterodactyl to Mr. Kite to Mr. Windows to Cool Cat and talking chairs, flowers, and fish.  Conky the Robot would each week dispense that show's secret word, a stunt seemed designed to irritate parents' as much as possible.  One of my favorite recurring characters was the Salesman, whose appearance at Pee Wee's door would cause panic and disconcerted screaming each week.  And how could you describe Jambi to someone who hadn't seen the show before?  A disembodied genie's head who each week could solve whatever problems facing either Pee Wee or his friends with those amazing words, ""Mekka Lekka Hi-Mekka Hiney Ho!""

I'm delighted that these are available now on DVD.  A whole generation of kids has passed not knowing what a great thing they missed.  Kids who are in high school today have only a vague idea about Pee Wee, though they might know his two movies.  For many he was someone whose career ended because he did something very, very bad, though not many seem to know what that was.  Now we get to see all of these great shows again, and they get to discover him for the first time.",1099785600,82,4228,4.538258575197889

I loved the first two seasons. I like fun, oddball stuff, series that are different. Weird stuff you might not of heard of like The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Danger 5, Eerie, Indiana, Galavant, and The Middleman.  I did get bored watching seasons 3 through 5 of Pee-Wee's Playhouse though.

If you're looking for something more mature you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2046,5.2607361963190185
