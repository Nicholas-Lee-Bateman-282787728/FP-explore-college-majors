A man begs coins from passing gentlemen in London. A woman visits Holmes about her missing husband. She tells Watson where she saw her husband before he went missing. Watson goes to this vile place. [Is that black tar opium?] An opium den? Is Holmes working undercover? He talks about Neville St. Clair, the missing gentleman. His wife saw him in an upstairs room! She saw him in an upstairs room! The police are summoned to search this room, but only finds her missing husbands clothes! Boone was arrested. Later Mrs. St. Claire received a letter from her husband with a signet ring. Is Neville still alive? Or murdered and thrown into the river?

Boone is a well-known professional beggar. Holmes learned nothing from his investigation in that opium den. [Note that old-fashioned lock on the inside of that door.] Holmes gets an idea when washing his face to remove the make-up! They go to see Boone in jail. Holmes uses a wet sponge to uncover the missing man. Neville explains his past experiences as an actor and a reporter for a newspaper. He owed a lot of money to pay back a debt. He earned 700 a year as an aristocrat among beggars, much more than 100 a year as a newspaperman. There will be no more of Boone the beggar. Neville returns home to his wife and family.

I think this story is based on a true event. Imagine earning seven times more by performing in public as a beggar? Or does it mean a wealthy persons income is derived from fooling people? Nowadays Neville would be in advertising. Your opinion may vary.",1405296000,,1569,4.5371024734982335
