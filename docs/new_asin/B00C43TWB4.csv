5690463,5,B00C43TWB4,"My husband and I enjoy this French series, Blood of the Vine! We have seen the first two seasons, and are looking forward to Season 3. Pierre Arditti is wonderful as the wine expert and solver of mysteries related to wine and the French estates. We like to think that we are learning a bit about the French and their wine, but whether that is true or not, it is an entertaining series. I think we like that the ""star""  is of a ""certain age"" and that his lover is also of his age and not some young chick who could be his daughter. Good series. I recommend it. In French with English subtitles.",1417824000,3,593,4.201754385964913
5690464,5,B00C43TWB4,Great TV series from France.  Ya gotta be able to read sub-titles while watching the show.,1416528000,,90,4.625
5690465,4,B00C43TWB4,"This season as great as season 1.  Easy to follow the stories with
the translations.  Acting well done.  The vistas of the country sides are
breath taking.",1404950400,,155,4.666666666666667
5690466,5,B00C43TWB4,"A unique series with the premise of using a wine expert to decipher evidence from grape beverages.  Beverages, because each episode features a different wine, and even the wine-based cognac.  Each episode also features a different wine region, so along with the wine, you get beautiful scenes of the countryside of France.  The acting is excellent, and the characters have wonderful complexity.  Get both seasons.  The characters develop over time.",1403395200,,448,5.3428571428571425
5690467,4,B00C43TWB4,"When I first saw the series on MHZ I loved it.  But it doesn't hold up as well for a 2nd and 3rd viewing.  However, it is in French which I love.  It takes place on vineyards around France.  There is great food in view.  Would like additional stories (seasons).",1392940800,,261,4.14
5690468,5,B00C43TWB4,I love everything about this series.  It is shot on beautiful locations.  The actors are all good and their characters are intelligent with a dash a humor.  The stories are also intriguing.  I can't wait for the next series.,1387756800,,224,4.666666666666667
5690469,3,B00C43TWB4,"Pleasant, light ""crime"" drama from France with beautiful scenery, and enough difference from American crime drama to warrant a view. Protagonist Benjamin Lebel is portrayed by Pierre Arditi who is a wine expert who travels the country solving problems at vineyards and of their owners. Has two assistants, a male and the incredibly beautiful, Catherine DeMaiffe. Both the series and Ms. DeMaiffe are worth a view. Well acted, brightly filmed and the stories are not dark and vicious like some dramas. No where near as good as Spiral but if you liked any of the mild English crime dramas set in the British countryside then raise the rating to four stars. Have purchased both series. I think some of the translation of french to english from MHz could be more accurate and it would be nice to be able to turn off the subtitles.",1385942400,,826,4.743055555555555
5690470,5,B00C43TWB4,"I had heard about this series, but I didn't realize how WONDERFUL the series is until I watched it, a couple of times; I fell i  in love with it.  The casting is excellent, from the major character (Arditti)  to his girlfriend (her character's name is 'France') to everyone else in it. I don't speak French so at first I had trouble reading the English subtitles since the characters speak so rapidly; but I got used to it.  The photography is remarkable and after each episode I had a sudden need, NEED for French wine!!!",1384387200,2,522,4.463157894736842
5690471,4,B00C43TWB4,"While the characters and story lines may sometimes drift from Gallic humor to the vapid, the live scenes of the French country side are remarkable and the acting is both educational and clever.",1378080000,5,193,4.878787878787879
5690472,5,B00C43TWB4,"European series don't have the money disponible as american ones, but this series is done in a way that you don't miss it. Good mysteries and good acting, very enjoyable. Recommended.",1372982400,5,183,4.935483870967742
