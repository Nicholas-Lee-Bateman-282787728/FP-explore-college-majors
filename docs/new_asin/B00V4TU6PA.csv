8709145,1,B00V4TU6PA,"This is filmed while she is teaching a group for what appears to be a destination 200 hour teacher training.

She doesn't seem to have a great grasp on anatomy: confusing flexion and extension with abduction and adduction, calls the same foot position sometimes flexed sometimes neutral. The anatomy instruction doesn't go beyond the students calling out and guessing if something is flexion/extension/neutral. Sometimes the students call out multiple things and she says ""Yes"" and moves on.

Muscles, bones, joints or ligaments are not shown or explained. There is no instruction on adjustments/assists.

This bothered me but may not bother others: She tells multiple girls that their butts are too flat and that they need to work on that.

If you are considering attending her teacher training this dvd may be useful in your decision.

There are WAY better anatomy dvd's available, spend a little more on Paul Grilley or David Keil's.",1490572800,,936,5.131578947368421
8709146,2,B00V4TU6PA,"Good to see what yoga-instructor training looks like.

But the content is not great.  If you're going to make a video where you describe the planar motion at the joints for a given yoga pose, then get it right and be consistent.

If anything, this video helped me understand the need to research instructor training schools & find one that teaches at a high level.  I would definitely not recommend this instructor training school.",1467417600,,431,4.783783783783784
