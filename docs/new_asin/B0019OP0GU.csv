3442949,5,B0019OP0GU,"Based on the much loved Noel Streatfield novel, this is a genuine 'for all the family' film, and most definitely appealing to young girls (and their moms).

A brilliant, fun and uplifting story, intelligent script, with terrific acting all round, gorgeous camera work, lovely sets costumes and music...  what more could anyone ask for !",1213142400,27,336,5.090909090909091
3442950,5,B0019OP0GU,"BALLET SHOES (starring Emma Watson... celebrated for her lead roles in the Harry Potter films...along with an all-star acclaimed ensemble cast) is absolutely wonderful. I personally am in love it. Targeting a very large and underserved audience which is best defined as ""moms and their daughters"", Ballet Shoes is a film about realizing ambitions; a film where its tag line `dreams do come true' is really the `spot on' underlying message of the film... and the storyline. I believe it is destined to be a huge success for it is a tale of inspiration indeed.

A big-budget Granada film production, originally for the BBC, Ballet Shoes is based on the literary classic penned by Noel Streatfeild that women especially are very familiar with as key reading material from their childhood. A costume drama with absolutely stunning cinematography, the film portrays 1930's London with a sense of dreamy realism. For those who recall the box office smash ""You've Got Mail"", the book is the one being sought after that Meg Ryan launches into a verbal expose about. Ms. Ryan was right on the money, as is this adaptation of the tale.

Ballet Shoes is the story of three orphan girls; Petrova, Posie and Pauline (Emma Watson) who are raised as sisters after being brought together by a rich, world traveler as babies. As they grow up, each girl develops a dream of their own. Pauline wants to be an actress; Petrova longs to be an aviator; Posie wishes to dance. Circumstances bring them together, and together they vow to go down in the history books. ""We three Fossils vow..."". This vow launches the three Fossil sisters on their voyage, a journey that they travel individually as well as together, one that can only serve to inspire any young girl who watches the film.

On a personal note, I watched this film with my 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son. While my son fought to pay attention (not surprising), my daughter was riveted throughout the film. The appearance of `Hermoine' as a teen brought her into focus early on, and then the tale itself kept her eyes and ears wide open. She's asked repeatedly to watch Ballet Shoes again, which of course she has. My son, of course, is back to watching `his thing', Spiderman, Superman and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers...

Ballet Shoes, in a certain sense, is a long form faerie tale, and I recommend it with no reservations whatsoever as superb family viewing.",1211500800,82,2416,4.7727272727272725

Interesting story and something out of the box which I really appreciate. I didn't understand the girls' frenetic obsession with not being ordinary, although I do get the importance of finding your passion and that's a good message for young girls. More should concentrate on that, as well as having a good center, instead of the frivolity and uselessness that teenagers are sucked into these days (boys, parties, popularity, clothes, boys). I also thought the ending came together too quickly. The acting was good however and I am a fan of Emilia Fox. One thing struck me and that was all the characters were single, widowed or orphaned. Perhaps the message was people can choose to come together as a family and we should take care of each other.",1393891200,,900,4.561728395061729

3443001,4,B0019OP0GU,"BALLET SHOES is a 2007 British television film, based on a 1936 novel by Noel Streatfeild, with screenplay by Heidi Thomas, and directed by Sandra Goldbacher.
  Set in 1930's London, the film tells the stoy of three orphans adopted by an explorer and paleontologist, Uncle Matthew ""Gum"".  The girls live in near poverty in his house with his niece, Silvia Brown, and her former nanny, Nana.  The story describes the girls' struggles to fulfill their dreams: Pauline as an actress, Petrova as an aviatrix, and Posy as a ballerina.  To help make ends meet, Silvia and Nana take in boarders.  Still, the household needs the wages of Pauline as an actress and Petrova as an extra, putting additional weight on their shoulders.
  The film can teach young viewers some valudable lessions, such as the good and bad aspects of ambition, the need for perseverance in hard times, and the pitfalls of a swelled head. And for adult viewers, there is the acting!  Emilia Fox, Victoria Wood, Eileen Atkins, and Emma Watson are the leads.  Yasmin Paige and Lucy Boynton are the younger sisters.  And there is the usual excellent British supporting case, including Richard Griffiths and Gemma Jones, also from HARRY POTTER.

3443017,4,B0019OP0GU,"The BBC's Christmas offering for 2007 was this charming version of BALLET SHOES, based on the Noel Streatfeild novel which I remember with particular fondness from my own childhood.  Despite a few shortcomings, this is a well-scripted and beautifully-cast production which I'm sure will capture the imaginations of all those who remember the original story.

World explorer Great Uncle Matthew (or ""Gum""), played by Richard Griffiths, brings home a few extra packages from three of his trips - namely three orphan babies.  Raised by his niece Sylvia (Emilia Fox) and her Nanny (Victoria Wood), the babies grow up into charming young girls with definite ideas about their eventual fates in the history books.

Pauline (Emma Watson) wishes to be an actress, Petrova (Yasmin Paige) is crazy about aeroplanes; whilst Posy (Lucy Boynton) wants to be a dancer.  But when ""Gum"" disappears without trace on one of his expeditions, money becomes tight.  Sylvia arranges to rent out some of the larger rooms in their house to lodgers, one of which, Theo Dane (Lucy Cohu) is a teacher at a children's stage academy run by the formidable Madame Fidolia (Dame Eileen Atkins).  The school doesn't charge tuition fees for its working-class pupils, instead collecting a small percentage of the wage when a child is hired out for a stage engagement.  Pretty soon, Pauline and Posy are caught up in the exciting world of show-business, and, realising that there's no such thing as a 14-year-old aviatrix, Petrova half-heartedly tags along.

The main issue with this BALLET SHOES is length.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas had a tough assignment in condensing down the events of the book into a 90-minute film (the original book does cover an awful lot of ground) and there are perhaps too many subplots to weave into the narrative; including Sylvia and Mr Simpson (Marc Warren), and the other lodgers Dr Jakes and Dr Smith (brilliantly played by Gemma Jones and Harriet Walter).  The ending feels particularly rushed.  There is an earlier 1975 miniseries (which featured Emilia Fox's mother Joanna David as Theo), and I feel that the 2007 film could have been stronger if it was presented as a longer miniseries, allowing all of the characters the chance to expand and have their own special moments to shine.

Fans of the novel will probably lament at what has been left on the cutting-room floor but this is an altogether-delightful film version of BALLET SHOES, despite its shortcomings.",1339286400,,2467,5.04679802955665
3443018,5,B0019OP0GU,"I admit I only watched this movie cuz Emma Watson was in it....she's just too lovely to pass up a movie on. I'm a guy what can I say. She's breathtaking. It was nice seeing her in a movie outside Harry Potter.  She proved that she can act.  Brains and beauty.  Her character goes through the movie to be onstage and acting. When she becomes real famous she turns a bit into a brat and selfish. She pushes Petrova in acting just to help her own place in theater. Once the lead female role in Alice in wonderland is given to her understudy she realizes her bratty ways and selfishness has gone too far and makes her readjust herself to be more humble and giving.

The cast was pretty good and I liked the ensemble for the most part.  It has a decent ending I guess with an overall lesson I guess which is Dreams Do Come True.

The DVD includes deleted scenes and about a 20-25 minute interview with Emma Watson about the movie which I enjoyed very much.

3443025,3,B0019OP0GU,"Okay, so I might be biased, as this was one of my favorite books as a child, but I have to say that the changes they made in the transition between pages and screen are disappointing to say the least.  The girls are all much too old for about half the movie, but that was the least of my concerns.  Poor Winifred is turned into some child monster, which she never was in the book.  She was a sympathetic character with bum luck who would never have screamed and thrown a fit in the stairwell of a theatre.  More surprising was the way they made Posy into such a brat.  She was never, in the book, so vicious.  Sure, she was a dancing mimic and a bit of a clown, but she was never obnoxious and mean.  This is all minor, in my opinion, compared with what they did to poor Theo.  I guess the feeling was that this movie was not interesting to adults (although I'm sure my mother, another rabid Streatfeild fan, would disagree), so they killed off Mr. Simpson's wife, gave him a dead son, and set Theo and Garnie to fighting over him.  This is tragic.  What kind of an example is Theo to young girls, drinking in her basement room, and bemoaning her lost days as a Bouncing Babe?  Why was this necessary?  All in all, it was an okay movie but a horrid adaptation of a beloved children's story.  Sad.",1311897600,20,1296,4.219512195121951

The story is their struggle to grow up and achieve their heart's dream. It works well for a story from a book, although the children are a bit older in the film compared to the book. It hurts nothing. Well acted by young actresses, but it is the other, adult acting that caught my eye.

What a wonderful look at some very famous British film/TV/theater stars. They help this story immensely. No upstaging, just wonderful characters played very realistically. They make this period story divine. And costuming wonderful, from common wear to actress elaborations.

3443033,5,B0019OP0GU,"First off, I'd like to say that I received this movie only 3 days after my purchase! Fantastic! It also came with a movie poster inside, which is now hanging beauifully on my wall! After receiving this movie, I literally watched it once everyday for a week. I myself, am a former ballerina of 12 years, and also an obsessed Harry Potter and Emma Watson fan, found this movie perfect. It is a british film, but it's in no way difficult to understand the accents, as they are all professional and speak very clearly.

This is the story of three orphan girls who live with their guardian and nanny who are renting out rooms in their house in hopes of making some money. As the story progresses, the new housemates see different quirks and potentials in the girls, and suggest they take their hopes and dreams further.

It's great for all ages because there isn't any bad language or scary parts in it, but I feel as though it would best hold the attention to children 10 and older.
I am most pleased with this purchase and if you love Emma Watson and/or ballet, heartwarming films, you'll love this one!",1296086400,3,1100,4.495

I looked on Amazon and found one site offering a single, new DVD of Ballet Shoes for $5.10 +S&H, then I found this site offering 3-DVDs of Ballet Shoes for $37.50 (now $44.08) and scrolling down the details, it read [FORMAT: Box Set] My thought was that there must be a trimmed version, and a longer version (as sometimes happens with made for TV movies for example.) So I purchased the 3-DVD ""Box Set"" and gave it to her today (Christmas Morning) and on closer examination, the whole family agreed that these were three identical copies of the same movie. I was silently outraged and embarrassed. I wanted to send them back for a refund, but my granddaughter was so excited about the gift that she tore open one of the sealed containers so we could all watch it together. I decided to let her give the other two copies to two of her friends.
  I returned to this site after that and looked more carefully and found further down on the page, it said [Product Description: Includes 3 Units of: Ballet Slippers (KOC-DV-6545)] but why does it say (FORMAT:Box Set)? I realize I should have read all the information more carefully, but I can't help feeling somewhat deceivede by this seller, and there was no such mention of my 3-DVD dilemma in the reviews I read.

All have to struggle to meet their goals but survive emotionally and financially and support one another as a family unit.

3443036,4,B0019OP0GU,"Set in 1930's London, The Ballet Shoes is the story of three orphans Pauline, Petrova, and Posy who are ""found"" by their ""Uncle"" Matthew (known as Great Uncle Matthew or GUM) an eccentric adventurer. He gives them the surname ""Fossils"" due to his penchant for paleontology. Uncle Matthew goes off on another of his many, lengthy adventures leaving the girls in the care of his niece Sylvia (AKA ""Garnie"" or Guardian to the girls)and Nana (Sylvia's nurse when she was a child).
The women are forced to open the large London home to an interesting group of borders in order to make ends meet in Matthew's absence. The girls are also sent to dancing school in the hopes of honing some marketable skills. The three girls have very different aspirations (Pauline-acting, Petrova-aviation, and Posy-ballet) but they make a pact to put themselves in the history books and help their Garnie and Nana support the household.

What I liked --
-The film is very well done with a cast of memorable characters and witty dialogue.
-I also found that it communicated good life lessons. For example, Pauline chooses to become a spoiled prima donna while acting in a play and the director demotes her to understudy.
-The film also puts an emphasis on the values of hard work and family.
-A happy ending.

What I did not like --
It was such a cute movie that it is really hard to pick it apart and find something not likable.

3443038,3,B0019OP0GU,"I just purchased this film and watched it twice for a fair review. I thought the beginning and the ending was rushed; especially the ending. Too much smoking. Loved the characters and thought they were well cast. I bought it for grand daughters and don't know if I'll lend it to them because of the excessive smoking. I guess I anticipated something more like ""The Railroad Children.""",1276387200,,384,4.746268656716418
3443039,1,B0019OP0GU,"I haven't read the book, so I had no idea what to expect. I heard people singing its praises, so I thought I'd watch it. It looked a little corny, so I was already braced for that. It's not really corny, it's just really boring. I don't have anything against British cinema or period set movies, but this one just went on and on and left me wondering where it was going.

The storyline is rushed, which wouldn't be that bad if they didn't also rush the character development. The movie just presents the girls as growing up into pretty teenagers that get sent to a performance academy due to financial need, this being paid by one of the elder sister's, Sylvia (Emilia Fox), tenants.

From there, you just get a feeling of entitlement from the girls. It's like watching a 30's set version of My Super Sweet Sixteen. Pauline (Emma Watson) soon gets a big head because she's pretty and it assures her roles in acting. Watson's acting is terrible. I love her in Harry Potter, probably because I'm so used to seeing her as Hermione, but even in that role I think she's a pretty mediocre actress. Ballet Shoes gave her a chance to shine on her own light, but she looks too old for the role and makes her character come off like a drama queen.

Posy (Yasmin Paige)is supposed to be gifted in ballet, hence the title, but other than that, we don't really see her dance well. Furthermore, it's not really clear why it should be titled Ballet Shoes because her dancing is a pretty minor thing in the plotline. It only makes her come off as a spoiled brat and only diverts the attention from golden-girl Watson for a mere seconds.

Speaking of temporary attention detractor, this brings me to Petrova (Lucy Boynton), who the movie treats just like the author did when picking her name. She moans a little bit about hating performance and wanting to be a pilot. The audience is supposed to feel sorry for this character but instead it just feels like a breath of fresh air to have a character not being painted as beautiful and talented in this movie. I didn't particularly like her more than the other orphans, but it was less boring to watch her struggle where she didn't belong than having to watch Watson's character whine because she was in an early film.

Overall, the movie version of Ballet Shoes butchers any meaning in the story by using cheap techniques like the apparently made-up romance between adult characters and constantly trying to make the audience feel sorry for the orphans. The former fails simply because they were adopted when they were babies by loving people, had the good fortune to find some random lady to pay for an education, where blessed with good looks and are considered talented enough to earn a living. They also kept reminding us they were poor, which I felt hard to sympathize with seeing as they still had new-looking clothes to wear and lived in a house bigger than mine.

Based on the reviews I've read, this movie is no good unless you have the lingering memory of the book. I have not read the book, so I only have the lingering memory of frequently checking how much time was left of the movie.",1273449600,9,3129,4.539007092198582

The girls in the movie danced and acted because they hand to and in the end they really never learned anything but to keep working even if it was hurting the family.  In the end the family is pulled apart and but since everyone gets what they want it's ok.  Right?!  Keeping the family together and letting the girl have childhoods is not as important as getting the money.

Emma Watson plays a bit of a brat, but humbles easy. In an interview she once said that it is probable that she will do very little acting after Harry Potter, but after seeing this film I believe she is mistaken. Insight into the plight of a single woman trying to support 3 orphans in post-war Britain was riveting. That those orphaned girls could find work in the entertainment field seems plausible. The story is very moving when the girls feel so much pressure to excel at their crafts to help support their little family.

3443052,4,B0019OP0GU,"Having never read Noel Streatfield's ""Ballet Shoes"", I can't compare this movie adaptation to the book [I understand that the movie is a condensed version of the book], but I must say I found the movie to be quite entertaining. This is partly due to the wonderful assembly of actors chosen to act in it and the various familiar faces - Emilia Fox [ played the role of Ms Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice], Emma Watson [Hermione of Harry Potter fame], Lucy Boynton [played the youngest Ms Dashwood in the 2008 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility], Richard Griffiths [also of Harry Potter], Harriet Walter, Eileen Atkins, and Gemma Jones. It was so wonderful seeing all these beloved actors together in one movie.

The story starts with an eccentric paleontologist, Dr GUM [Great Uncle Matthew played by Richard Griffiths] who is forced to take in his orphaned niece Sylvia [later played by Emilia Fox] who is accompanied by her nurse, Nana. Over the next several years, GUM goes off on expeditions returning each time with a baby girl, and the three are raised as sisters - Pauline Fossil [Emma Watson], Petrova Fossil [Yasmin Paige], and Posy Fossil [Lucy Boynton]. When GUM goes off on another expedition and doesn't return for 12 years, the ladies and girls are left to fend for themselves, forced to take in boarders, and Pauline also goes to work on the stage as an actress to supplement the family income. The focus is mostly on the three girls, and though Emma Watson does a credible job with her role, she is often outshined by Yasmin Paige as the middle sister, Petrova, who finds herself in a quandary - she can neither act well like Pauline or dance like Posy. What she wishes for ardently is to be an aviator, a high ambition indeed for one so young and at a time when women pilots were few and far between.

There is also a sub-plot [which seems more like an afterthought] focusing on a supposed love triangle between Sylvia, a male lodger, Mr Simpson [Marc Warren], and female boarder Theo Dane [Lucy Cohu].

The story was paced well-enough but was flawed in terms of character development if only because of the movie's length - only 84 minutes total running time. But the period details were wonderful and the charming and able cast made it a worthwhile and engaging watch.

Some of the bonuses on the DVD include an interview with Emma Watson, some deleted scenes, a movie trailer, and a audiobook reading of an excerpt from Ballet Shoes.",1235952000,4,2480,4.694252873563219

The film is true to the book, with a few bizarre exceptions--what on earth was going on with Nana's hair, and where did the romance and all that smoking come from, and why? However, these anomalies are easily overlooked because the rest of the film really captures the look and feel of the book--the way I always pictured it in my mind. I only wish it could have been longer, so that we could have seen more of the story. Much of the casting is perfect--particularly Pauline, Gum, and Winifred. Emma Watson is the perfect Pauline!  I highly recommend this movie for anyone over age 8 or 9, and hope that it sparks a resurgence of interest in all of Noel Streatfeild's ""Shoes"" books.  Her stories embodied the concept of ""girl power"" long before the phrase was coined.  Another ""Shoes"" film would be nice too--maybe someone will make Movie Shoes into a film.

They grew up in a big old grand London house alongside trilobites and T Rex until those treasures had to go to make room for the growing girls.

Petrova wants to be like Amy Johnson when she grows up.  I think Amy Johnson must've been the British Amelia Earhart.  Posy was found with only a pair of pink toe shoes when she was a baby, her mother having been a young ballerina who had neither resources nor time to care for her child.  And the oldest is a stage natural.  These three girls live a life filled with love and possibility, if not one of materialism.  Still, their needs are always met and the girls receive great educations and theatre training.  IN fact, everything in this movie seems to be blessed and appointed by Providence.  Every time they have a need, it's magically filled by strangers literally at the door.  And in the end, everyone has a happy ending.

3443058,4,B0019OP0GU,"Usually I don't like this type of movie but this was enchanting and had my attention for most of the movie. I didn't think of Emma Watson as her Harry Potter Character at all when I saw her in this movie (even though there is another Harry Potter actor in it). I give this movie 4 stars for one big reason and that is I normally don't like ""chick flicks"" but this one I had to see all the way through.",1225152000,,401,3.962962962962963
3443059,2,B0019OP0GU,"I was dissapointed in this movie. There is not anything terribly inappropriate, although several comments are made about the girls' bust sizes and one of the characters wears low cut blouses. There wasn't much of a plot somehow and many dead ends. The youngest girl, Posey, turns into a brat and winds up getting her way in the end. There isn't much ballet in it at all and the title itself has nothing to do with the movie. If you're a ballet fan, you will only be dissapointed. It's really not a children's movie.
The movie did keep my interest and the cast and acting is brilliant, but. . . . . Watch it if you want.",1224806400,5,619,4.299145299145299
3443060,4,B0019OP0GU,"It was a nice story, just a little slow to make its point. The girls were great actresses, and Emma Watson proved she can act as something besides Hermoine Granger, kudos for her. The redhead was also very good... especially in the scene when she's crying because her teacher died and won't be able to teach her anymore. The brunette was also superb... her character was my favorite. The only downside was the ""father""... his character was hardly convincing. I mean... who disappears for 12 years and suddenly return just in time? Maybe I had to read the book to understand it. Either way, great movie.",1224633600,,602,4.688679245283019
3443061,4,B0019OP0GU,"This is a nice movie for a family to watch. Emma's character is well played as are the other two girls. However, Emma's character is another Hermonie in another time. She is bright clever and wholesome. A trend I hope she continues.",1223683200,,232,4.5476190476190474
3443062,5,B0019OP0GU,"I really enjoyed Ballet Shoes.  I am a big fan of the original novel by Noel Streatfield and so I was nervous about seeing the film version, afraid that too much would be changed, but instead it is wonderfully true to the book and really makes the story come to life in a whole new way.  The characters were delightful, spot-on to the book, and the acting was well done.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good family-friendly flick with a feel-good story and strong, likable characters.",1223510400,3,526,4.634408602150538
3443063,5,B0019OP0GU,"This film is about 3 girls growing up in England in the 1930's and how they work to help support their household.  I find that it is very well presented and the story line is great.  I was impressed with the young girl acting in the film.  They all where like watching a much older actor.

I don't think anyone would be disappointed in buying this film.",1223251200,3,353,4.223880597014926
3443064,5,B0019OP0GU,"This movie isn't what I would call a ""chick flick"", but it is wonderful for Mothers and Daughters.  This is a very sweet story of success if family and friends come together to support each other.  It has some very purposeful messages, especially to young women, who allow their success in life to overcome who they really are.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and bought it the first day it came out.",1222560000,5,401,4.541666666666667
3443065,5,B0019OP0GU,"I bought this movie hoping to like it because of Emma Watson being in it. She is a great actress and this movie was wonderful with her in it. My daughter who is almost 4 didn't understand some of it, but she still enjoyed watching it with me. It is a movie we will enjoy over and over again!",1221782400,,291,3.9491525423728815
3443066,5,B0019OP0GU,"What a delightful adaptation of Mary Noel Streatfeild's(1895-1986)story.  She was an actress and prolific writer who very much wanted to provide children with worthwhile reading.  J.K. Rowling is a fan, and there's a few Potter alumni actors in this entertaining fable.

A paleontologist(Richard Griffiths, who plays Harry Potter's dunderheaded relative) first adopts Sylvia(Emilia Fox, whom I'll always remember as Georgiana Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice' and simply love).  He complains about it but moves out some dinosaur bones to make room; however, ""Great Uncle Gum"" repeats the process, bringing home three more orphaned, baby girls from various expeditions.  Sylvia cares for them in his museum-like home while he vanishes for twelve years.  Move ahead to the 1930's.  Money runs thin, and the girls make a pact to excel in their endeavors and to help their beleaguered, older sister save the home.  They take in some eccentric boarders and attend a dance academy as they try to discover their gifts and means.

The ensemble cast shines.  If you have ever watched BBC or Masterpiece Theatre you'll recognize many of these journeyman actors such as the great Gemma Jones(Dr. Jakes).  In regards to the younger actors, obviously, there's Emma Watson(Pauline) from 'Harry Potter' fame who portrays the thespian talent of the family.  Her character struggles with insecurity and pride, and Emma does a fine job expanding out beyond 'Hermione'.  She candidly talks up a storm about the making of the film in the extras.  She's a talented and bright, young woman.  Yasmin Paige(Petrova) plays the Russian girl who struggles fitting in anywhere.  Can't act or dance for the life of her, she wants to fly.  It's a tougher role since it lacks the flamboyancy of the others.  Finally, there's Lucy Boynton(Posy) whom we loved as Margaret in 'Sense and Sensibility(2007)'.  What a growing star!  Her timing and delivering are impeccable.  Again, she's absolutely hilarious.  Apparently, all the actresses enjoyed the dancing, but poor Lucy didn't much care for the red hair.

Sandra Goldbacher directs('The Governess'); Heidi Thomas wrote the screenplay(episodes of 'Cranford' and 'Lilies'- both excellent and a favorite of ours, 'I Capture the Castle').

 It amazes me how the Brits put out films like this.  It doesn't feel forced or contrived.  It bounces between drama, comedy, with a bit of whimsy and a dash of suspense and romance all wrapped neatly without any nasty bits or nasty people.  A family film geared for school-aged girls, but with enough to interest finicky adults.

The moral of the fable: Love and family are more important than accomplishment but still- go out and be all that you dream to be. Right on!",1221004800,9,2723,5.15296803652968
