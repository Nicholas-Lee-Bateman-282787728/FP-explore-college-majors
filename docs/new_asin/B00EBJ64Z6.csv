5901166,4,B00EBJ64Z6,"A year after the conclusion of Dickens's classic, this film picks up. Scrooge is delighted that he can finally fire Cratchit--in order to make him a partner, thus changing the firm of Scrooge and Marley to Scrooge and Cratchit. However, Marley's ghost is not done with Scrooge and transports him to 2013 Wisconsin, where there is work to be done.

Scrooge and Cratchit is now in the United States, where the firm, run by Timothy Cratchit VI, resembles Scrooge & Marley before A Christmas Carol. In other words, the young Cratchit is conniving, greedy, and possessed of all the Christmas warmth of a cactus. Here, the story centers around a young woman whose small restaurant is in danger of being foreclosed on by Scrooge and Cratchit as she is behind eight months in her mortgage. Scrooge, thoroughly out of place in 2013 Wisconsin, must try to convince Cratchit VI to change his ways.

This film is obviously a low-budget effort, but that doesn't stop it from having its charms. That's not to say that there aren't flaws, but I think anyone who is likely to watch this film is equally likely to overlook those flaws. The acting is a bit stilted at the start of the film, almost as if the film were shot in order. The waitress at the diner complains of not having been paid in four months, thus raising the question of how she can survive without pay for so long and why, if she can afford to do so, she works in a small restaurant. But these flaws are small, and the heart of the film is in the right place, in tune with Dickens's story.

I should point out that there are more frequent and more detailed religious references in this film than in the original (which, if I recall, has only a passing reference). (This point is raised not as a criticism but as an observation that might help others looking for Christmas films with more--or less--religion in them.) Scrooge is not merely an advocate for Christmas but for Christianity itself here. Nothing about this strikes me as intrusive. After all, would not Scrooge, after his visitations, have a renewed interest not only in Christmas but in the underlying faith?

One curious note: In this film, both Scrooge and the owner of the restaurant are well versed in Shakespeare and quote numerous plays. This point struck me as inapt since I cannot see Scrooge as a Shakespeare fan. Prior to his rebirth in the original Dickens story, he would not have devoted much time to reading or theater-going, and in the year after, I cannot imagine that he would have had sufficient interest to memorize so much.

On balance, I think any fan of the original story will enjoy this film. Moreover, parents should find nothing objectionable in it. There's no hint of foul language and no trace of nudity or sexual reference, and the only scenes that might be frightening to young children (those scenes with ghosts) are milder than in most film versions of A Christmas Carol.",1383782400,7,2915,4.65242718446602

Clearly a labor of love to those involved (it has a VERY community theater feel about it), but also clearly a very bad movie on just about every level (acting, film work, sets, etc.).

5901185,3,B00EBJ64Z6,"This film is a well-made sequel to the classic tale, A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens.  The quality of the ""film"" is so high that you can see pimples under heavy make-up. The colors are vibrant.  The filming location, at least for some of the outdoor scenes, is, apparently, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, and clean, luxurious neighborhoods therein. The costumes and props are well-designed and believable.  Overall, this is a positive, heartwarming, Christian film, ideal for people of all ages.

The story begins in December, 1844, approximately one year after Ebenezer Scrooge entertained the ghosts of Jacob Marley and the Christmases Past, Present, and Future. Then, when he goes outside to go Christmas shopping, he miraculously finds himself in the fictitious city of New Britain, Wisconsin.  (Fort Atkinson apparently plays the ""role"" of this city. I was able to determine this by Googling the name of one of the businesses whose name appeared on a window.)

Adjusting to simple things, such as squeezable ketchup bottles, Mr. Scrooge soon discovers that it's 2013, approximately 170 years after he went out shopping in London. He also soon discovers that a descendant of Tiny Tim has inherited his business, and is as miserly as he (Scrooge) was, in November, 1843. He's about to foreclose on the Dinner Belle dining establishment, owned and operated by a young blonde woman named Belle, who is a charitable woman, a lot like the Belle with whom Scrooge fell in love in his younger days.

I'm docking this film One Star for having a Subtitles link which doesn't work. You can put the cursor on the word Subtitles, and hit Enter; you can put the cursor on the word Off, next to the word Subtitles, and press Enter, but you can't get any subtitles to appear.

I'm also docking this film another Star for shamelessly pandering to Hispanics. Belle's employee is a brunette woman with a thick accent and an attitude problem who often lapses into speaking Spanish. Scrooge cheerily greets one of Timothy Cratchit VI's Hispanic employees in Spanish, in Wisconsin, in 2013. According to the census of the year 2000, less than five percent of Fort Atkinson's population was Hispanic. Incorporating Hispanics and Spanish into this film in such an affirmative way is obviously a ploy to market this film to Hispanics and liberals who don't think we can have enough Hispanics in the U.S., or pander to them sufficiently.",1480809600,3,2417,4.98014888337469

Take note: this will probably be one of the only REAL, reviews you will read on here...Before you spend a minute watching this or worse yet, spend a dime on it, please read on...
I love ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""Scrooge"", so naturally I was immediately drawn to the possibility of a sequel to Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"". After seeing all of these positive reviews, I decided to pay for this train wreck -disaster of a film. Where do I start? First of all, I would venture to guess that about 95% of the ""positive"" reviews on here are either fake or from friends and family of the people involved in this nightmare of a movie. The acting is so beyond bad, that you will find yourself laughing as you pay homage to the porcelain God..several times. I have seen better actors in infomercials and bad local car and insurance commercials. There is a ton of ridiculous inconsistencies. For instance, in 1800's London ,, there was no electric fireplaces. Would it have killed them to use a real fireplace or just not even show the fireplace in the scene at all? Also, how in 2013 did no one ever hear of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol""?. The worst part of all, is that it is HEAVILY doused in religious over AND undertones. Very preachy and obviously made by a Christian movie company. If I had known that, I would have NEVER spent a dime on this joke of a movie. I think that the original idea of a sequel, though strange in itself, was clever but poorly executed. I could see with some real writing, production and acting, that someone could do some justice to the sequel idea. Perhaps even a Lifetime or Hallmark TV movie. The only person that could act and was entertaining and almost believable, was the actor who played Ebeneezer Scrooge (David Ruprecht). The award for the worst actress on film, goes to Arlensiu Novelli who played Petra. I'm not sure which is worse, her awful accent or her atrocious acting? The ""villain"", Timothy Cratchit VI (Matt Koester's) forgettable performance falls somewhere in between raging psychopath and serial rapist. Can you say overacting? However, the award for the most , over the top, overacting goes to dear St. Nick himself Torry Martin. Just unbelievably awful. You have to see it for yourself. I think writer/director Steven F. Zambo, needs to keep his day job. Either that, or he found his true calling of making awful movies. This movie is so bad, that I haven't even seen it on those bad religious, cable TV stations. It is appallingly insulting to the cinematic world. To be fair, writer/director Steven F. Zambo, did have a good idea, but he needs LOTS of help to turn his vision into something remotely watchable. To sum up. This movie is a can of cheese whiz, complete with atrocious acting and writing, as well as heavily riddled with inconsistencies and dreched in religious undetones. I can't believe I wasted good money on this yuletide crap fest!",1451347200,,2928,4.676356589147287
5901194,1,B00EBJ64Z6,"I had high expectations, so maybe this failed because I expected more than it could deliver.  It was obvious that they had a low budget, but the acting was poor.

This movie did nothing to condemn non Christians. It was no different, really, than the Dickens classic, simply a futuristic version. It was very well written.
The only thing for me was that the acting/Directing was not Hollywood quality and it felt like like I was in the front row watching a play rather than the movie. But again, the story was very good, and as the movie went on, the theatrical feel almost grew on me. Probably will with future viewings. It would be fabulous to watch in a broadway theater. Of course the outdoor scenes with vehicles would be hard to pull off indoors. It was odd. Even the outdoor filming had a play type feel to me.
At any rate, my 4 stars says alot for the writing. If you enjoy the scrooge theme, this is a worthwhile addition. Especially for family viewing.",1417737600,8,1045,4.447916666666667

I thought the movie was fun, creative, and brought about a good message, though I could have done without the religious nonsense. It seems as though the filmmaker falls into the classic pits that Christians fall into of portraying atheists as cold and callous where Christians are good and kind. Sorry, but you don't have to be religious to be a good and charitable person, and for implying otherwise, I dock this movie two stars from what would otherwise be a 5-star review.

Even though I felt slapped in the face for the connotation that because I'm an atheist I must be cold, callous, and greedy, I thought the storyline was fun and the acting was really great. David Ruprecht was, in my mind, a perfect choice for Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Though it has its downfalls, I will be watching this movie year after year.",1404259200,,956,4.650887573964497

In the New World,, The Hispanic waitress will connect with Tim Cratchit the VI.  The new Belle, Cractchit VI's sister, will connect with Cractchi's assistant, ( the nerd).

Not only did this movie add to my love of the Charles Dickens classic, for all of its wisdom and insight on what Christmas is truly all about, but it expounded upon that theme with such kindness, insight, and genuine small town warmth, that it makes you feel that this movie COULD happen in your own town or city...and you can easily find yourself lost in the film, as much as Mr. Scrooge himself is! I loved the twists and turns that showed how some characters were much more than you initially assumed they were...so true to life. Don't judge a person by first impressions--each person is a valuable and precious gift, and if you take time to see, there is always more than meets the eye. Love can change a person, a family, a town, and even the world...just watch and find out! <3 Thank you for putting together a film that makes us laugh, cry, and moves us to change, all at the same time.

5901232,5,B00EBJ64Z6,"In the original Dickens story, Dickens uses beautifully crafted words to create fantastic imagery within the readers mind. Today's movies seems to rely on magnanimous special effects to capture the attention of the audience, and the storyline suffers..... if it even exists. In order to be deemed a success, Car crashes and explosions are part of almost every movie released today. Mr. Scrooge to see You, produced by a small independent movie studio actually follows Dickens footsteps with relying on storytelling and subtle imagery, instead of shock and awe special effects. Who hasn't laughed at the person unfamiliar with modern gadgetry resulting in a slap-stick-esque ""pie in the face"" consequence. The ketchup bottle scene in the movie is indicative of the movies whimsical way of ""sucking"" the audience into the story by using real life anecdotes. This is a movie that yes, as others have noted, I as a father could sit with my daughter, and enjoy the movie for what it is; and not sit on high alert waiting for the foul language bomb to hit. The underlying theme of the golden rule is as timeless now as it was in the original. The movies Christian message which if truth be told has value in solidifying that same golden rule and the true reason for the season.
I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to sit down with the family or just by themselves to take a break from the dribble that passes for entertainment on TV and in the movies today. Be sure to have pop corn ready before it starts, you won't want to miss any part of it.",1393200000,,1553,4.671532846715328

5901243,5,B00EBJ64Z6,"In recent years movies about Christmas generally fall into two categories:  Christmas as a showcase for dysfunctional relationships, or Christmas as a background for sentimental romance.  Few and far between have been the movies about Christmas as a truly spiritual and religious experience.
Therefore it is with great pleasure that one can sit down and enjoy Mr. Scrooge to See You.  This is a movie that deftly avoids the two pitfalls and definitely fits into the third category.  Although Dickens A Christmas Carol has been presented and adapted in countless motion pictures and television shows, Mr. Scrooge is (in this reviewers recollection) the only true sequel to the story of Ebenezer Scrooges ghostly visitations on that memorable Christmas so long ago.
Its a sequel that takes a decidedly unique turn, as the reformed miser finds himself transported to the present day and faced with a task that took the combined efforts of three spirits in his own case:  turn a miserly man into someone who knows how to keep Christmas the year round.  Scrooge finds himself tasked with the job of showing Timothy Cratchit VI the error of his Scroogian ways.
The film succeeds on many levels.  As a fish-out-of-temporal-water, David Rupprechts Scrooge is properly flummoxed by such modern phenomena as motorcars, television remotes and sidewalk Santa Clauses.  He finds help in navigating these unfamiliar waters from Belle (Shannon Moore), the down-on-her-luck owner of a failing diner who still cant resist the urge to give free breakfasts to the needy.  Her mortgage is due to be terminated (on Christmas Ev, no less!) by Mr. Cratchit (Matt Koester), a grumpy banker who despises the holiday and all the sentiment it entails.
And here is the level on which this movie succeeds most refreshingly.  Many a Christmas film spends two hours getting its protagonists to learn the true meaning of Christmas, only to have that meaning be something like be kind to others or value your friends and family.  Mr. Scrooge does the same, with a notable difference:  producer, writer and director Steve Zambo knows what the real meaning of Christmas is.  (Hint:  It has something to do with the first syllable of the word!)  In this movie, the birth of the Redeemer is what the holiday is all about, and the fact that Baby Jesus grew up to be the Savior from sin is what gives Christmas the power to reform even the hardest of hearts.  It has done so with this Ebenezer Scrooge, whose Christian sentiments are a natural part of his character.  His faith is what makes him try so hard to lift a kindred soul from the darkness of his selfish ways to the Gospel light that gives Christmas its true glow.
But don't get the wrong impression!  This is no Sunday School pageant.  The profundity of Mr. Scrooges themes never weighs down the lightheartedness of the entire venture.  Its not a preachy movie, although it doesnt shy away from religious discussions.  But together with a renewed appreciation for the power of Christs nativity, the viewer walks away from this film remembering comedic gems like Scrooges delight with the video game about distraught birds and their mistreatment of pigs, or his amazement at the concept of the modern tea bag.  And you can be guaranteed that you will never look at those huge inflatable Christmas lawn decorations in the same way again!
In short, this little gem is a different kind of Christmas movie.  Mingled with the laughter are some important and timeless issues.  The pacing never flags, the plot has enough twists to keep you guessing until the very end, and at the end of it all, you will know that youve seen a unique and wonderful film.  The final scene hints at a sequel to come; youll be looking forward to it!",1389744000,,3744,4.849056603773585

5901261,5,B00EBJ64Z6,"In 1843, what would become a holiday literary classic, ""A Christmas Carol"", was published in England. Written by the acclaimed Victorian author Charles Dickens, Ebenezer Scrooge personified miserly ways and the cold-hearted treatment of his fellow man. Nearly two centuries later, any society can lay claim to these same attitudes. However, Ebenezer Scrooge is given three supernatural glimpses of his eternal destination, should he continue upon the path of social and personal indifference. Ultimately, Scrooge elects to put life's rudder hard over, and changes his course. The true meaning of Christmas, the reason for the season, transforms Scrooge and the reader of ""A Christmas Carol"", as it has transformed hearts and minds globally. 170 years after this tome's pages were first turned, Salty Earth Pictures Writer and Director Steve Zambo brings to the screen what might have become of Ebenezer Scrooge, a year after the former business partner of Jacob Marley adjusts the sails of his mortal existence. Zambo's inspiration and humor, originating from the pen of Charles Dickens, will capture the attention of any audience, of any demographic. Accomplished stage and screen actor David Ruprecht masterfully dons the guise of Ebenezer Scrooge. His wistful and sincere desire to share his time, talents, and treasure is a positive lesson for any generation. Zambo artfully combines time, travel, and moral challenges for Scrooge, while his lead character must convince a young business upstart named Timothy Cratchit VI, convincingly portrayed by Matt Koester, the ""errors of his ways"", before he too experiences the regret of Jacob Marley. New York screen, internet, and commercial actress Shannon Moore completes the lead ensemble, graciously contributing her stunning beauty and charm as Belle Dickenson, the owner of a diner untimely mortgaged to the firm of Scrooge and Cratchit Financial. Producer Beth Zambo assembled a wonderfully talented local cast that seamlessly weaves the story together, transitioning from moments of laughter, to moments of intense reflection. Director of Photography Frank Datzer gives solid evidence why he is one of the most professional and competent to capture and edit the essence of quality writing seen through a camera lens. Salty Earth Pictures has indeed produced yet another classic family film, destined to occupy a very visible and treasured home among Christmas DVD's lovingly shared any time of the year. This film further solidifies Salty Earth Pictures as an honest and trusted source for quality media and entertainment.",1384905600,2,2577,5.477386934673367

The highlight was that everyone was rolling on the floor laughing at the awful quality, awful acting, awful music, just terrible. Giving one star instead of zero because we will always remember the fun we had watching such a bad movie.

This movie has a very very religious message and its offputting to me that it isn't disclosed anywhere. I get that Christmas is by its nature religious, and I am religious myself, but the long, too long, dragged on, monologues quoting bible verses and scenes visiting with the pastor were tedious.  This felt like a Focus on the Family movie, but far worse quality.

Overall if you're with the right crowd and the spiced nog is flowing, this may be worth it for a few laughs. But don't expect much more than that.",1514073600,2,812,4.5479452054794525
