It includes a lot of his ""floor barre"" routine, which he used to give after the regular barre, before the center, as I recall. I wanted to find a recording of that, so I am glad I found this. I have since then began to study Pilates, and some of this is based on that, too.",1480723200,,390,3.8271604938271606
7803461,5,6300174913,"This is the best program, I use it almost everyday! I got the first copy long time ago. Over the years, I bought several more for friends. I have tried other programs too, this has been the best. The instructions are right at the point (such as, ""stretch the legs out to lift them up"", while attempting to lift up is hard to achieve, stretching them does make it happen). If 60-min cann't be done in a day, I usually do it over two-day period. The music is quite beautiful too.",1127088000,2,477,4.252747252747253
