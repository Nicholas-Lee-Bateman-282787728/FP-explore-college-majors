8240485,5,B001154MWK,"This is an excellent and engaging dramatized bio of Brother Andre of Montreal, now St. Andre Bessette. The film, directed by Jean-Claude Labrecque, opens with actual footage of the coverage seen in movie houses in ""Movietown News (1937), showing the 1 million people (from the province of Quebec and the New England states) who came to view Brother Andre in his casket. He was not embalmed, and his body was exposed for 6 days; this was an act of faith. The story of his life is narrated by his character, speaking with his niece who comes to visit him. You learn of the many miracles obtained by him through the intercession of St. Joseph, with whom he had a deep friendship. His superiors were amazed at this simple brother who was a porter at their College de Notre Dame. Across from this college would arise the enormous Oratory of St. Joseph, visited by thousands every year.
This VHS is available in DVD. It consists of the movie in French (88 min); and the movie in English (dubbed?) (88 min). The actors are very natural and believable.",1436832000,,1044,4.618279569892473
