8158835,5,B000KRMSJE,"this is a must have item from singer/songwriter and former frontman of Savage Garden, Darren Hayes. beautifully filmed at the Sydney Opera House in July 2006. i was unable to attend this tour and this is the next best thing. :) if you're able to find it, and u enjoy Darren Hayes or jsut good music in general, GET THIS DVD! im almost afraid to watch it now because the man himself signed it for me.
definately a MUST HAVE item!",1216080000,,428,4.296296296296297
