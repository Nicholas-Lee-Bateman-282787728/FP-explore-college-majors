7996932,1,B0000AGQ60,"This is definitely not a reflection on the quality of the movies included in this set. ""The Parent Trap"" is a classic, as are the other three included here.
No, the word ""junk"" refers to the quality of DVD's included in this set. I had to return my first set, because the case was broken on ""Old Yeller"". No big deal. But then...the secondary disc on ""The Parent Trap"" skipped and stalled, and ""Swiss Family Robinson"" wouldn't even load.
Having had terrible experience with Disney DVD's previously (""The Great Locomotive Chase""), I opted for a refund instead of dealing with the frustrations of another set that was defective.
Frankly, Disney's products seem to have so many problems, I doubt I will ever buy another one. Many of their movies are in the wrong ratio, some are terrible transfers (""Old Yeller"" in particular, and also the Chinatown scene in ""The Love Bug"" comes to mind), and now I've had this set and ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" which have had ""playability"" issues.
For a company with such a great library of old movies, it is really sad that they put out such an inferior product. As I would love to include them in my DVD library. But one shouldn't have to concern themself with worrying whether a DVD is going to play or not when they purchase it.",1087689600,25,1267,4.610619469026549
