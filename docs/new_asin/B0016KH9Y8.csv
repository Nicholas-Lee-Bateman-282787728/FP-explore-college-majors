8326146,5,B0016KH9Y8,My son was in Afghanistan and flew over when the chopper went down. Communication was bad and his chopper did not know there was a problem. Very interesting movie. I have watched it several times,1386633600,,195,4.6
8326147,2,B0016KH9Y8,I expected this to be either more documentary like or more theater.  It didn't really meet either of those expectations.  The acting was pretty bad.  It did tell the story like the book did.  I feel like the book is a far greater way to experience this story though.,1303171200,2,266,4.36734693877551
