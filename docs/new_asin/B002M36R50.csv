3950585,4,B002M36R50,"THE LEMON TREE is a quiet, gentle film that tries to tackle a big subject in a fairly small manner.  This Israeli film (in fact, it was co-funded by the Israeli film council) wants to illustrate the frustrating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians by having one fairly personal event stand-in for the entire conflict.  Or at least, that's how audiences seem to want to see it.  I choose to look at it as one example of how misunderstanding can be turned into stubborn intransigence by those cultural & political differences.  No film can distill something as long-standing and complex as these issues into one story...but one film can certainly shed light.

Just barely on the Palestinian side of the West Bank, Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass) leads a lonely, simple life trying to squeeze a living (pun intended, sorry) out of  her small lemon orchard.  It's hard work, and other than yielding very tasty lemonade, Salma gets little from her labors.  However, these trees were planted by her father, and they are all her family really has connecting it to a past, to give a sense of place & pride.  Salma's husband has died many years ago and her grown children are distant from her (her son lives in Washington DC and works as a busboy).  She is lonely, but seems more or less at peace with her life and doesn't expect much from it.

One day, just on the Israeli side of the fence, the new Israeli Defense Minister decides to move in with his glamorous wife.  One suspects that he has chosen this remote location at least in part to be freer to travel the country away from his wife, because he seems to have a bit of a wandering eye.  No doubt, he also felt this location would make some sort of positive political statement.  His security forces decide, however, that the neighboring lemon grove would make a good spot for terrorists to hide in and lob grenades without ever being spotted by the guards in the newly installed tower than hovers over Salma's land.

So Salma receives a letter, telling her that she'll be compensated for the fact that all her trees are about to be uprooted.  Salma is appalled at the thought of losing her only source of income and her family's pride.  So she actually finds a Palestinian attorney willing to take her case.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the fence, the Defense Minister's wife Mira takes an interest in the Lemon trees.  She sees from her window the poor Palestinian woman who clings to her dignity, and seems to find herself wanting in comparison.  As the case gains national notoriety, Mira finds herself torn in her loyalties.

I won't reveal more of the plot, because there isn't all that much of it.  This is a four person story, and it delicately reveals shadings of character and feeling that eventually make us feel great sympathy for almost everyone.  The Israeli minister is something of a cardboard character, but Mira, Salma and her attorney Ziad are all very flesh-and-blood people.  Palestinian society precludes strong emotions from Salma, but the graceful Hiam Abbass (known to US audiences for THE VISITOR) gives us a smoldering performance hidden beneath the very placid demeanor.  She says very little, yet her work is so open that we can virtually read her every thought.  We take her journey very personally.

Very delicate relationships form, including a strange, wordless one between Mira and Salma and a surprisingly vibrant one between lawyer & client.  While the movie follows an overall predictable David vs. Goliath track...the nuances of the journey are what make THE LEMON TREE a pleasure.

There are moments of humor (the best around a photo of Salma's husband) and there are occasional bursts of raw, unfettered emotion.  All the actors do well, and while the movie is slow paced, it never drags.

My complaints are minor.  The cinematography is mundane.  I would have expected the lemon trees themselves to serve as more powerful symbols or to at least be filmed gorgeously, but both efforts fall flat.  And just for English-speaking audiences, the subtitles provided are the most annoying kind.  They are white and sometimes lost against white shirts.  Why can't they be the usual yellow and placed at the bottom of the screen?  I missed several lines of dialogue.

In the end, the film shows the politics in Israel as being too skewed towards keeping the military happy and less interested in the human side of the Palestinian issues.  It also shows Palestinian patriarchy as  contributing to the lack of progress of its people.  Both sides show both good and bad.  It's an even-handed film, and even though Israeli government funded, I'd say that the artists behind the movie were allowed a fairly free hand politically.  I was glad to see that.

The film is unrated, but I believe would be a PG.  There's no violence, no sex and if memory serves, little bad language.  I would think, though, that kids would be bored.  However, as an introduction to the concept of the age-old tensions in Israel, THE LEMON TREE might serve well.",1251072000,,5021,4.771461716937355

'Syrian Bride' has it all.  I've actually pressed it into the hands of people browsing the International section at my local video store.  It's that good.

Now Riklis returns again to the border and beyond.  Where Syrian Bride was set in the Golan Heights, Riklis' 2008 (Israel) release, Lemon Tree, sits on the line between Israel's pre-1967 border and the West Bank.  The film relates the story of a Arab woman (the great Hiam Abbass) whose simple, unadorned life tending to a lemon tree grove is turned upside down when Israel's defense minister moves in next door and declares the grove a security threat.  But the regal and proud character portrayed by Ms. Abbass does not go quietly into the night.  In case you think this sounds unlikely:  It's not.  While fictionalized, Riklis' script was prompted by a real, similar event.

Again, Riklis has assembled a wonderful ensemble of actors - it's essentially a quartet:  the esteemed Ms. Abbass as Salma Zidane; Doron Tavory as the defense minister; gorgeous, elegant Rona Lipaz-Michael as his wife; and Ali Suliman, intelligent and caring as Zidane's lawyer Ziad Daud.  And it's a treat and honor to see Makram Khoury - so fierce and stirring in 'Syrian Bride' - appear here in a small but important role.  This gentleman brings gravitas and importance to any film graced by his presence.

3950588,5,B002M36R50,"Israeli director Eran Riklis retells a story based on actual events concerning a Palestinian woman whose lemon grove is threatened when a cabinet minister takes up residence in a nearby West Bank settlement. The film represents the countless instances in which Palestinian property has been sacrificed in the interest of Israel's security and all resistance to Israeli occupation has been understood as terrorism. Seeking the help of a lawyer, she sues to keep the grove intact, and together they pursue the case all the way to the Supreme Court.

Paired opposite her in the story is the wife of the defense minister, who is ambivalent about the obsessive concern of the Secret Service and the IDF for her safety. Meanwhile, the news media gets wind of the situation, and before long the story acquires international interest. The wheels of justice attempt to reach a compromise, while the Wall being erected between Israeli settlements and neighboring Palestinians comes unfortunately too late to protect one from the other.

Wonderful performance by Israeli-Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass as the woman and Ali Suliman as her lawyer.",1242518400,,1135,5.230769230769231

3950611,5,B002M36R50,"Touching!  Real!  Visceral!  A brief glimpse into the life of a contemporary Palestinian woman, revealing her power and vulnerability.  Her fierce yet dogged determination are real and heroic.  Even in losing, she is victorious. Hiam Abbass' capacity to reach emotional depth with just a glance or gesture is comparable to Irene Papas, the great Greek actress.  She will be remembered from her role as the desperate mother of a Syrian immigrant in The Visitor (2007).  Her co-star, Ali Suliman, with his graceful, physical movements, shares in the ability to convey intense emotion with his eyes, a tilt of the head, or a hand gesture.  Their on-screen chemistry is formidable.
The silent compassion of the Israeli neighbor,, portrayed by Rona Lipaz-Michael, is convincing as the sensitive yet emotionally trapped (in her own cultural mores and biases) neighbor; yet her failure to to ""measure up"" to her own feelings of injustice is disheartening.  One wonders what point Director, Eran Riklis, intended to convey.  Is it to reveal the inertia and ambivalence of many Israelis?  Or just to let the story speak for itself?  Either way, the story leaves the viewer with indelible images and heart-felt emotions.",1462406400,,1210,5.180412371134021

3950634,4,B002M36R50,"Definitely not Israel-friendly, in fact highly critical with 90% sympathy for the poor Palestinian woman. The best part for me, though, was the Palestinian sense of victimization. Interesting, though, is that instead of making the best of a bad deal, the Palestinians come off as psychologically paralyzed. There's a sense of near complete inertia. There's a sense of ""why bother trying to fix our lives.

That's the part that bothers me most. Until modern times, Jews have always been the underdog, but that only made them try harder. The Arab world can easily provide the capital to get their Palestinian brothers and sisters out of the mire and help them become a self-sufficient and proud people. Once they have something to lose, they are more likely to become part of the nations of the world.

Of course, not mentioned in the film is the other half of the Palestinian people, those controlled by Hamas, which has an objective to destroy Israel. As long as that political and military situation exists, there's no hope of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. And for anyone who thinks I am letting Israel off too easily, think of the changes that might occur in Israel politics if the Palestinians demonstrated a willingness  to live in peace.",1429574400,,1257,4.919811320754717

What I enjoyed about the film is that they bypassed most of the politics and religious overtones to show that the divide is difficult for people of conscious on either side. It was an even-handed approach not common in stories on the topic.

There are difficulties with the film which is why I can't give it a higher rating. The added subplot love story was just one too many plot lines for me. While I did like the movement of the films main character, the lemon trees, the rest of the movie did not document similar character movements. While the story draws parallels to roots in America it would have been better to draw connection with that relationship than between the heroine and hero.

3950663,5,B002M36R50,"This is a wonderful drama that raises a personal issue to the level of telling the story of a nation.  On one side, there is a beautiful Palestinian widow, who runs a lemon grove on the border of the occupied territories.  She is modest, not at all political, and yet has a quiet determination and natural charisma.  On the other side, the newly installed Minister of Defense for Israel moves into a house next to the lemon grove, bringing a security apparatus and personal power to the remote area.  Suddenly, the lemon grove is called a security threat and he wants it cut down, in accordance with the secret service officers who are assigned to protect him.  What ensues is a legal battle that becomes a political cause celebre.

Many viewers have criticized the film as anti-Israeli, but I disagree with that judgment on a number of levels.  First, there are a number of full-blooded characters on the Israeli side, who struggle with what is happening.  In particular the Minister's wife:  she sees the situation, yet does not know what exactly she might do and struggles with it in spite of her husband's insensitivity.  When she talks to a reporter, her actions lead to unforeseen consequences, which highlight many aspects of Israel's political system yet make no definitive statement and offers no unambiguous message.  In my view, this is very much like what might happen in real life.  Second, the Palestinian characters are also not at all simple:  some are good, some not, and many are normal people trying to get through the day.  While the woman is certainly a victim, there is nothing maudlin or tendentious about her struggle:  it is realistic and she faces terrible odds.  There is also a lawyer of good motives but questionable behavior and nosy, conservative neighbors.  Third, and most importantly, there is a vital subtext to the story.  No matter what you can say about the difficulties and injustices that Palestinians face, Israeli democracy is still functioning:  the protagonists can seek legal redress and due process, the press is independent, and there is no outright repression of their actions.  Indeed, the Minister is embarrassed that people ask him if he is ""afraid of lemons"".

A lonely widow, Salma (Hiam Abbass) tends her lemon grove, originally planted by her father.  When the new Israeli defense minister (played by Doron Tavory) moves in next door, his bodyguards decide that the grove could harbor a terrorist, and order it cut down.  Salma rebels, and enlists the aid of a peculiar divorce lawyer (Ali Suliman) to assist in her appeal to this order, an appeal that goes all the way to the Supreme Court.  In the meantime, the defense minister's wife (Rona Lipaz-Michael) begins to develop feelings of guilt regarding this decision.

Salma is caught in the crosshairs of issues relating to security, politics, and culture, but she lets none of them stand in her way.  ""There are more important issues to be concerned about,"" Salma is always being told.

But not to Salma.

""Lemon Tree"" (originally released in 2008; 106 min.) brings a political parable, very loosely based on true events, in which the Israeli Minister of Defense moves literally on the border line with the West Bank, on the other side of which a Palestine woman is tending to her lemon tree grove. For security reasons the Israelis decide that the lemone trees must be taken out. The Palestine woman decides to appeal the decision, all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court. Meanwhile, an unspoken bond of sympathy for the Palsetine woman arises in the Israeli Defense Minister's wife. On top of all that, the Palestine woman and her (much younger) Palestine lawyer have strong feelings for each other, much to the dismany of the Palestine higher-ups (eager to uphold the family's reputation, even though the husband has deceased). The movie builds towards the finale (the hearing at the Israeli Supreme Court). You'll just have to see for yourself how it all unfolds. The final moments if the movie are very moving.

While I really enjoyed watching the movie, for me the movie is at the same time curiously flawed, as there really are no believable Israeli characters in the movie (other than the Minister's wife): they are all buffoons, fanatics and idiots, usually at the same time. The movie also centers more than once on the infamous ""Wall of Separation"", giving the impression that all of the West Bank's border with Israel is walled in. The truth is quite a different story, which I saw with my own eyes when I was in Israel just 2 months ago. The vast majority of the West Bank is NOT walled in by the ""Wall of Separation"" (mostly there is just a fence). Not to mention that since ""Lemon Tree"" was released, now more than 2 years ago, there hadn't been a single suicide-bomb attack out of the West Bank onto Israel. An inconvenient truth indeed. Watch ""Lemon Tree"" instead for the fabulous performance of Hiam ""The Visitor"" Abbass, won a very much deserved Israeli Academy Award for this.",1295481600,2,2231,4.688775510204081

Salma, played by Hiam Abbas, fights in court until the end to protect her lemon trees. As the story builds, Salma for the first time falls in love with her attorney and develops human understanding with the Israeli wife of the defense minister.

Rona Lipaz-Michael, and Hiam Abbas and the rest of Palestinian and Israeli cast deliver a great performance enhanced by great direction. The lemons and the built walls are smart motifs played brilliantly to create deep moving scenes.

In other reviews the movie is being attacked by many people, accusing the movie of being biased for Palestinians against Israelis. If you watch the movie with an open mind, something that rarely occurs with this subject then perhaps as I did you will observe the following:

1-the movie shows good people on the both sides like the Palestinian old worker in the grove and the Israeli soldier in charge of watching the grove.
2-extremist exist on both sides and the road of understanding is not a paved superhighway.
3-thinking is encouraged as shown by the Israeli's wife conversation with her friend and with one of the soldiers. Compassion between Israelis and Arabs is encouraged through the peaceful human encounter between Mira and Salma, who are supposed to be enemies not friends.
4- A wonderful picture of the Israeli justice system is shown when Palestinians are allowed to go to the Supreme Court against the state of Israel. This is the most desired interaction between the two groups of people instead of killing.

Israeli director Iran Riklis created a master piece that is worth watching and recommending to friends.

3950686,5,B002M36R50,"Lemon Tree is a poignant parable based on several case studies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We get to taste the bitter lemons for the Palestinian widow,Salma Zidane(Hiam Abbass),whose livelihood comes from the lemon grove she inherited from her father and grandfather. She makes sparkling lemonade and offers the drink to visitors. An old family friend helps her water the trees and remove decaying leaves and fruit. However into her life comes the shadow of the newly built home of the Minister of Defence,Israel Navon(Tavory).Although this would be unlikely in truth that Israel,the minister, would situate his home on the Greenline border between Israel and the West Bank,we suspend our disbelief. At the back of our minds is the ""separation barrier""(the wall) between Israel and the occupied territories and its effect being a symptom of deep fear,malaise and injustice. The increasing separation between the two Semitic peoples is embodied in the patriarchal systems of belief on both sides.

Mira(Rona Lipaz-Michael) is incarcerated in her new wealthy home,suffering her own divisions from her husband and loss of her growing children. She looks across the fence separating her and Salma,and through silent observation and empathy with her Palestinian neighbour,comes to disengage herself from her philandering husband,who too easily conforms to his security staff's wishes. The state of Israel slaps a requirement that the grove should be uprooted due to a fear of terrorists using it for cover,becoming a threat to the minister's life. They offer compensation, but Salma's sentimental roots in the grove, now her children have grown up, as well as her livelihood,make her seek out a young lawyer,Ziad Daud,to help her take it to the Supreme Court. Her male Palestinian neighbours disapprove of her taking any compensation and also think she dishonours her late husband's memory by her closeness to the lawyer.

In the meantime the grove is enclosed by a locked fence and houses a watchtower. The lemons go unwatered and the trees decay. Salma climbs the fence to tend to her trees and collect lemons,only to be chased out by soldiers. Even Mira,the minister's wife climbs a fence to talk to her near neighbour,only to be prevented by her security detail. There are of course separations between Salma and Mira of language,class,wealth,race,and politics,but there are roots of empathy between them,based on a feminist subtext from Riklios and Suha Araf,co-writer and journalist. I didn't think the love affair between Mira and Ziad Daud was necessary, as he had relationships already. Also the end seemed heavy-handed, making what was figurative,literal.

What I liked about the film is that it used subtlety of acting(especially Abbas,Lipaz-Michael and Ali Suliman),the lyricism of the cinematography(Klaussman),cleverly using imagery of barriers and shutters and enclosure,and the use of the David vs. Goliath parallels of the individual's revolt against the state to avoid any heavy-handed polemicism or messages to highlight this woman's dilemma,symbolical of the interminable Arab-Israeli conflict which has no end or solution.

3950693,1,B002M36R50,"Lemon Tree is a professionally made film. Israeli films like the Lemon Tree and others like James Journey to Jerusalem, Beaufort, Waltzing With Bashir and Syrian Bride cause great damage to Israel with their negative depiction of Israelis. There are extremes on both sides, rich, poor, strong or weak, but the general tendancy of the leftist liberal Israeli filmmakers is to complain, point out what's bad about Israel, criticize rather than show us what's beautiful and positive, i.e., Israeli doctors saving the lives of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, Arab-Israeli students enjoying one of the highest standards of education, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, national medical insurance, benefits Jews in Arab countries never enjoyed. Rather they were persecuted, and 800,000 of them were expelled from their homes from 1948-1950. Mostly Israelis in Israeli films are seen as unsympathetic, brutal bullies abusing the ""poor victimized"" Palestinians, while the Palestinians are glorified as heroic, resisting Israeli racism, far from the truth. Whenever Israelis deal with the Palestinians they are apologetic, forgetting the thousands of Israeli civilians and soldiers (young sons & daughters of Israel) murdered and maimed by Arab wars and Palestinian terror spanning 60 years since the birth of the nation, and going back to the 1800's culminating with the slaughter of the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron in 1929. One must also remember that Palestinians murdered and maimed 100,000 Christians in Lebanon which provoked the Christian revenge at Sabra and Shatila that got extensive media coverage while atrocities committed by the Palestinians & Muslims were and still are covered up out of fear of offending them, i.e., following the 9/11, and Ft. Hood murders (now determined that he was acting alone, a man suffering from great stress. I ask, if he was suffering from stress and acted alone, why did he prepare so professionally for his murder spree, and cry Allahu Akbar as he gunned down his victims, instead of just taking his own life?). Israelis should learn PR from the Arabs who will never, ever criticize their suicide bombers and terrorist gunmen, rather they celebrate them as great heroes martyers, and boast rather than express guilt over their murder and maiming of civilians. Film, Syrian Bride, by the same director shows the Syrian-Druze as hating Israel. Why not make a film about the thousands of heroic Israeli-Druze who serve in elite Israeli combat units and love Israel and serve in the Isreali army with honor? Anyone seeing these negative Israeli films as this lemon Tree, gets a distorted view of Israel and its valiant people, and I deplore these films and the leftist Israel Film Center that supports these Israel bashing movies. One yearns to see Israeli films return to days of when Israel was represented by the lumnious and humane I Love You Rosa, and The Policeman.",1264118400,19,2938,5.226694915254237
3950694,4,B002M36R50,"THE LEMON TREE is a quiet, gentle film that tries to tackle a big subject in a fairly small manner. This Israeli film (in fact, it was co-funded by the Israeli film council) wants to illustrate the frustrating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians by having one fairly personal event stand-in for the entire conflict. Or at least, that's how audiences seem to want to see it. I choose to look at it as one example of how misunderstanding can be turned into stubborn intransigence by those cultural & political differences. No film can distill something as long-standing and complex as these issues into one story...but one film can certainly shed light.

Just barely on the Palestinian side of the West Bank, Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass) leads a lonely, simple life trying to squeeze a living (pun intended, sorry) out of her small lemon orchard. It's hard work, and other than yielding very tasty lemonade, Salma gets little from her labors. However, these trees were planted by her father, and they are all her family really has connecting it to a past, to give a sense of place & pride. Salma's husband has died many years ago and her grown children are distant from her (her son lives in Washington DC and works as a busboy). She is lonely, but seems more or less at peace with her life and doesn't expect much from it.

One day, just on the Israeli side of the fence, the new Israeli Defense Minister decides to move in with his glamorous wife. One suspects that he has chosen this remote location at least in part to be freer to travel the country away from his wife, because he seems to have a bit of a wandering eye. No doubt, he also felt this location would make some sort of positive political statement. His security forces decide, however, that the neighboring lemon grove would make a good spot for terrorists to hide in and lob grenades without ever being spotted by the guards in the newly installed tower than hovers over Salma's land.

So Salma receives a letter, telling her that she'll be compensated for the fact that all her trees are about to be uprooted. Salma is appalled at the thought of losing her only source of income and her family's pride. So she actually finds a Palestinian attorney willing to take her case.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the fence, the Defense Minister's wife Mira takes an interest in the Lemon trees. She sees from her window the poor Palestinian woman who clings to her dignity, and seems to find herself wanting in comparison. As the case gains national notoriety, Mira finds herself torn in her loyalties.

I won't reveal more of the plot, because there isn't all that much of it. This is a four person story, and it delicately reveals shadings of character and feeling that eventually make us feel great sympathy for almost everyone. The Israeli minister is something of a cardboard character, but Mira, Salma and her attorney Ziad are all very flesh-and-blood people. Palestinian society precludes strong emotions from Salma, but the graceful Hiam Abbass (known to US audiences for THE VISITOR) gives us a smoldering performance hidden beneath the very placid demeanor. She says very little, yet her work is so open that we can virtually read her every thought. We take her journey very personally.

Very delicate relationships form, including a strange, wordless one between Mira and Salma and a surprisingly vibrant one between lawyer & client. While the movie follows an overall predictable David vs. Goliath track...the nuances of the journey are what make THE LEMON TREE a pleasure.

There are moments of humor (the best around a photo of Salma's husband) and there are occasional bursts of raw, unfettered emotion. All the actors do well, and while the movie is slow paced, it never drags.

My complaints are minor. The cinematography is mundane. I would have expected the lemon trees themselves to serve as more powerful symbols or to at least be filmed gorgeously, but both efforts fall flat. And just for English-speaking audiences, the subtitles provided are the most annoying kind. They are white and sometimes lost against white shirts. Why can't they be the usual yellow and placed at the bottom of the screen? I missed several lines of dialogue.

In the end, the film shows the politics in Israel as being too skewed towards keeping the military happy and less interested in the human side of the Palestinian issues. It also shows Palestinian patriarchy as contributing to the lack of progress of its people. Both sides show both good and bad. It's an even-handed film, and even though Israeli government funded, I'd say that the artists behind the movie were allowed a fairly free hand politically. I was glad to see that.

The film is unrated, but I believe would be a PG. There's no violence, no sex and if memory serves, little bad language. I would think, though, that kids would be bored. However, as an introduction to the concept of the age-old tensions in Israel, THE LEMON TREE might serve well.",1261440000,22,4984,4.771461716937355
3950695,5,B002M36R50,"This is a great and thought-provoking movie with great cast.  It is centered in the occupied West Bank where a newly appointed Israeli minister of defense purchased home next to a lemon orchard.  The orchard is owned by a Palestinian widow Salma (played by Hiam Abbass) who is struggling to make ends meet. Once the minister moves in, the secret service starts to assess the security situation around the minister's residence.  The orchard is an immediate security liability as it could provide cover for attackers and terrorists.  First a fence with a guard tower is put in place and soon after the order is issued to cut down the orchard.

Once Salma receives the news, she is distraught yet defiant.  She is determined to fight the decision in Israeli courts.  She is fortunate enough to find an upstart lawyer who is willing to help her fight the decision in a military court.  They stand no chance taking on the Israeli military in their own court and lose.  Salma refuses to give up and appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court.  As the young lawyer works with Salma, he comes to admire her defiant spirit and continues to helps her all the way through the Supreme Court hearings.  They don't win, but achieve some concessions, which is a huge victory itself.

The wife of the defense minister, Mira, spends most of her time home either looking at the beautiful trees in the orchard or trying to explore her surroundings and find some company while ironically trying to get away from the security service folks who are there to protect her.  Moving to the West Bank exposes Mira to a new view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  All of a sudden, it's her family and her home that's invading someone's privacy and threatening someone's existence - namely to Salma and her orchard.  Mira begins to quietly sympathize with Salma and her plight and starts questioning her husband's actions.  When Mira tries to bring up the subject of cutting down the orchard with her husband he seems to have no patience or sympathy for the plight of a Palestinian widow.

When she finds out that the orchard is to be cut down she asks ""does Israel know no limits?""  This play on words (Mira's husband's first name is Israel like the name of the country) seems to be the central idea of the whole movie and the crux of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The question is, what's a proper way to provide security for Israelis (the terrorist threats are certainly real and need to be dealt with) while preserving decent living and dignity for ordinary Palestinians?  Currently, the Israeli government is building a security barrier around the West Bank in hopes to achieve the former end.  The film is presenting a poignant view of how this may irreversibly change the lives of the people on both sides of the barrier.  Is erecting this wall between the two peoples the right solution?  At the end of the movie, Mira leaves her husband and he ends up alone in his fancy home, secured by a concrete barrier with no view of Salma's orchard, most of which was cut down.

What I like about Eran Riklis' movies, either this one or the Syrian Bride, is that he takes a critical view at both sides of the conflict.  Including criticism leveled at his own culture and people.  In this movie he point a critical finger at some Palestinian men who are concerned about Salma's honor (since she's a widow and is meeting with a single guy, her lawyer), yet the completely ignore her poverty and plight.  Instead of helping her with work in her orchard as good neighbors, they sit in a pub all day drinking, smoking, playing cards and complaining about the Israelis.  Another level of criticism is represented in the character of the lawyer.  While he's willing to help Salma, he's also a pretty good womanizer. He's engaged to a daughter of a high level Palestinian official, yet he's making moves on Salma.  He was educated in Russia, where he married and had a daughter with a Russian woman.  The implication is that they divorced due to his infidelity.

The only thing I'm not sure about is whether any Israeli politician would buy or build a house in the West Bank outside an official settlement?  However, I still give the movie 5 stars as the movie addresses a critical idea of co-existence, tolerance and mutual respect that all of us, regardless of where we live, need to think about. Our world is getting increasingly more cosmopolitan with people of all backgrounds living side by side and unless we make it work, we could end up with wall built up all around us.  I highly recommend this movie.",1259452800,33,4574,4.683354192740926

Summary: The 2008 Israeli film 'Lemon Tree' stars the alluring Hiam Abbass in the role of Salma Zidane a Palestinian widow struggling to maintain her home and lemon tree orchard against the encroachment of her new neighbor Israel Naron (Doron Tavory), the Israeli Prime Minister. The high ranking official sees the orchard as an imminent danger to his families safety, a place where terrorist and snipers can move freely about hidden behind the foliage. Within a matter of days a fence and imposing guard towers rise between the two properties robbing Salma of her privacy and personal space. If that wasn't enough problems escalate to the point where the continued existence of the lemon trees are threatened. Using his political power and influence the Prime Minister plans to have the orchard destroyed thus threatening Salma's only source of income. Can one lone Palestinian woman fight and defeat the ""Powers that Be"" while maintaining her dignity and self reliance in a male dominated society?

Critique: 'Lemon Tree' explores one of the most reoccurring themes in Israeli films, the theme of boundaries. The lemon tree orchard symbolizes more than just a physical buffer between hostile neighbors. It is a boundary between rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless, Jew and Arab, male and female. While the storyline moves along rather slowly the introspective nature of the film more than makes up for the pace. As the viewer gains deeper and deeper glimpses into the lives and concerns of both households one begins to sympathize not only with Salma but with Mira (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the Prime Minister's wife who finds herself torn between the opposing positions of the two rivals.

I'm a big fan of Hiam Abbass and as always she delivers a stellar performance. She's strong, defiant and determined while at the same time exuding an aura of sensitivity, vulnerability and feminism that is irresistible. Well worth a watch or two. Another film you might enjoy if you like this one is 'The Syrian Bride'.",1256256000,53,2069,5.06158357771261
3950697,5,B002M36R50,"LEMON TREE (ETZ LIMON) is a film of quiet power, the kind of film that does not find it necessary to expose the audience to violence and conflagrations to make its point, but instead relies on the power of human reactions to carry the very heartfelt punch. Written by Suha Arraf and Eran Riklis (who also directs) the story is a deceptively simple one. The setting is the West Bank. On the Palestinian side of the border lives the widow Salma Zidane (the enormously gifted actress Hiam Abbass remembered best by American audiences for her luminous portrayal of the mother in THE VISITOR) who continues to tend her family's lemon grove alone, barely making enough money to support herself. Abruptly, on the Israeli side of the border, the government builds a house for the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) and his beautiful and wisely sensitive wife Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael). Strange neighbors, these, more under the influence of the Israeli Secret Police who are assigned to guard the Minister than sensitive to the basic kindness of human decency. The Secret Service decides the lemon grove must be cut down to guard against possible terrorist access to the Minister, a declaration that sets off Salma's fear of losing her land and income. Salma seeks the help of young lawyer Zaid Daud (Ali Suliman) who bonds with her emotionally and legally and together they fight all the way to the Supreme Court to save the lemon trees. Fences are built, soldiers abuse the privacy of Salma, and the increased publicity in the media divides not only the peoples on both sides of the border but also the Navons: Mira empathizes with Salma, champions her rights, and though the two women never meet, the bond between them transcends the ages long hostilities between the Arabs and the Israelis. The result of the interpersonal conflict between the Navons and Salma is buried by the expected governmental insensitivity and the film ends with some sad surprises.

The cast of this film, including the minor roles that draw focus for only moments but in a memorable manner, is uniformly exceptional. Hiam Abbass is rapidly becoming one of the most impressive actresses on the screen today: she says more with her eyes and her body language than pages of dialogue could attempt. The surprises come from the other members of the quartet of actors that lead this story, so impressive are their portrayals that the entire question of the West Bank conflict seems understandable...and remedial! Based on a true story, this is an excellent film on many levels. In Hebrew, Arabic, English and French with subtitles. Grady Harp, September 09",1252281600,,2645,4.943820224719101

8373429,5,B002M36R50,"This is a very good film, well-acted and compelling, with a story that is a microcosm of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. An Israeli defense minister moves into a settlement, like the current defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman. Next to him is a beautiful grove of lemon trees owned by a Palestinian widow. His security decides the trees have to go, because they could provide cover for Palestinian attackers. The Palestinian widow is heartbroken and irate. She leads a legal crusade in court, with a handsome attorney who has a crush on her. The Defense Minister's wife becomes more sympathetic to the widow than her husband. Watching this all play out to its ultimate conclusion is fascinating. Multiply this many times over and you will understand the land conflict that is at the heart of this problem.",1491091200,,807,5.029850746268656

8373432,4,B002M36R50,"A somewhat allegorical examination of Israeli-Palestinian relations through the scrim of a lemon grove. The trees belonging  to a Palestinian widow have been in her family for generations and when the new Israeli Defense Minister puts up a palatial home next door, the trees are deemed a security risk and have to be cut down. The widow sues. The sub-dramas are the Minister's wife's sympathizing with her neighbor and the unrequited attraction between the widow and her much younger attorney. There is a biblical injunction against Hebrew soldiers' cutting down the fruit trees of their enemies. Although, I don't think it's invoked in the movie, it seems to reflect a respect for the nourishment of the earth that God thinks ought to transcend human rivalry. At least, that is one Talmudic interpretation of the passage in Deuteronomy. Alas, modern Israelites seem to have forgotten this, among many lessons in humanity, in their quest for ""security"" at all costs.",1471737600,,966,5.113924050632911
