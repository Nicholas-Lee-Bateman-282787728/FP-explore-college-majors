Michael Bisbing is a cool as can be.
Could have been more fight scenes though.",1401235200,,194,8.285714285714286
4172071,3,B003QWVPSU,"I am a huge Rudy Youngblood fan, since his amazing portrayal of Jaguar Paw in Apocalypto.  While I found his performance and his fight scenes good and well played, I found the direction a bit choppy.",1383523200,,199,4.527777777777778
4172072,4,B003QWVPSU,I don't understand why all movies have to have love in them??? This is a fight movie yet i has love.... Whatever! Well the fight scenes in this movie are pretty authentic! I really enjoyed them. The actors did a superb job! I like the fact they actulley used fighters in the movie as well! Overall pretty good flick must see if you like UFC & MMA!,1299542400,,347,4.1940298507462686
4172073,5,B003QWVPSU,"Just to keep this short and simple-I think this is the best mma movie yet! The other ones I've seen are a little cheesy; but I was pleasently surprised with this one. Micheal Bisping is in the witness protection program and helps a young fighter make some money in underground hog farm settings fights. Afterwards, Bisping helps this guy get out of debt in the big city by killing off the young fighters debt collectors who ran off the young fighter in the begining of the movie by killing his brother and then threating to kill him for $60,000.00 dollars. Bisping was in the same situation as the young fighter and was placed in witness protection for killing off his personal debt collectors.",1295308800,,694,4.650406504065041
4172074,3,B003QWVPSU,"The other reviews are dead on. Never Back Down and The UFC have given birth to countless direct to dvd MMA flicks and most of them aren't that good. This one could have been better with a larger budget and UFC's Michael Bisping in the starring role instead of Rudy Youngblood. He doesn't have the look or charisma for this type of film. I like Danny Trejo but he's just grabbing a check here and definitely not in Machete mode. MMA stars, Bobby Lashley, Heath Herring, and Mike Swick appear for a few minutes each in so-so fight scenes but it's not enough. This is the same old down on his luck but exceptional streetfighter makes money to pay off gangster debts dreck but Bisping's swagger is worth a look. Basically, Beatdown is okay for a rental and may even be great at 4AM when nothing else is on cable. I just hope we get to see more of Michael Bisping in action films. Hopefully, some real filmmakers with money behind them will grab The Count and give him a starring vehicle worth more than a rental or late-night viewing.",1287878400,2,1030,4.426315789473684
4172075,1,B003QWVPSU,"I stole this movie from a Redbox machine using a coupon code. After reading the description, I figured it'd at least be passable, with some cool unarmed fight scenes. ""Brandon, a respected street fighter, is forced to flee the city after his brother is murdered and the money that was supposed to be paid back to a local gangster is stolen."" Sounds cool, right? Wrong. Tapout magically transports us to a world where everyone still lives with their parents, nu metal blasts through loudspeakers everywhere nonstop, and most of the girls in town are probably transvestites. Also, there's hardly a scene without the Tapout logo being prominently displayed in some way. You cannot escape, and you cannot avert your eyes. Be afraid.

This movie is essentially a 90-minute Tapout commercial, filled with bland dialogue, high-school-drama-production-level acting, and painfully excessive video effects. ""Hey, this 3-second clip of a pickup truck driving down a road is too boring. Better add some camera shake and film grain!! Yeah, that's the stuff!! Hardcore!!"" We can only assume that either this movie was edited by a 14-year old, or the camera guy was jerking off nonstop whilst filming. I could find literally no redeeming qualities in this pile of trash. Watching ""Beatdown"" is actually less fun than burying yourself in dirt up to your neck, then hiring a trio of Wal Mart greeters to beat your exposed head to a pulp with two-by-fours. I would rather light my balls on fire and listen to Insane Clown Posse at maximum volume until my eardrums ruptured than watch this movie again. Remember, I didn't pay a cent for it, so money has nothing to do with my decision.

The filmmaker should be driven out into the desert and left for the buzzards, along with all the other ""actors"".",1287273600,2,1780,4.910299003322259
4172076,1,B003QWVPSU,"I was suckered into thinking that this one might be alright, or even good (like<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unrivaled/dp/B0031XYLPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unrivaled</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption-Blu-ray/dp/B003FXXNBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption [Blu-ray</a>], the presence of ""real actors"" like Danny Tejo and Eric Balfour threw me, but this is another piece of junk that is meant to sucker people, MMA fans in paticular. These movies (Never Surrender, Death Warrior, Circle of Pain) are terrible, poorly acted, badly filmed, horribly written, even fans of the fighters should know that they only have cameos and tend to look bad, as in bad acting, both kinds. They do offer a few interesting fight scenes, but uh nothing like the real thing, loud nu metal music played over fights and montages, kinda fun, and gratitous female nudity, awesome. Otherwise, a total dud, and I'm a huge fan of MMA, as well as ""star"" Michael Bisping, who isn't bad, in a proper vehicle, he could be something. Don't be suckered.

p.s.
I just found out that the movie's leading actor, Rudy Youngblood, had starred in the wonderful<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypto-Blu-ray/dp/B000NQQ4ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypto [Blu-ray</a>], and did a fine job, here his acting is just okay, and any star quality he showed in Mel Gibson's film is sorely missing here. This makes me even sadder.",1284768000,2,1765,7.209302325581396
