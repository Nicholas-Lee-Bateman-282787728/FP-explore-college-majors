5322399,5,B009ERK0XW,"Please see my review for episodes 1-3.  The same comments apply for both.
This series is a worthy follow-on to the original Montalbano series.",1356652800,2,142,4.916666666666667
5322400,5,B009ERK0XW,"We really enjoyed seeing these episodes, which are as good as the ones with the older Montalbano.  It was interesting to see how the young Montalbano started evolving towards his later character, including the introduction of what will be his team.
We hope that there will be many more of these, as well as of the older Montalbano.",1356307200,5,331,4.706896551724138
5322401,5,B009ERK0XW,I liked everything about these episodes. It was everything that I expected and more. I hope there will be more of these movies coming.,1355788800,3,134,4.625
5322402,5,B009ERK0XW,"Surprise!  The actor who plays Montalbano acts exactly as the ""real"" Montalbano would though 30 years younger.  Same impulsiveness, same independence, same loves and hates.  I was prepared to be disappointed, but I am in fact quite impressed.  You also get to see the ""same"" cast of assistants --- some much younger, some just starting out, some the sons of the originals.  And with the same idiocyncrasies.  Thus five stars, just like the originals.  If you liked the originals, you'll like these almost as much --- if not more.  All that's missing is the incredibly beautiful Ingrid.",1355356800,11,585,4.958762886597938
5322403,5,B009ERK0XW,"The Young Montalbano is a prequel to the very popular Detective Montalbano Italian mystery series. The Montalbano shows were originally aired in the United States on the MegaHertz Networks in the Washington, D.C. area and quickly built a national cult following. Salvo Montablano is a Sicilian detective who works for the police as opposed to what the Italians call ""the flying squad"" and he is one of the great characters of detective fiction. Each of the Montalbano's is a movie in itself, with movie quality production in every sense. There is so much to love about these shows - acting, comedy, cinematography, script - that it is hard to know where to begin.

Young Montalbano shows the early years of Detective Montalbano. When the actors in Montalbano became too expensive or weary of their roles, RAI could not think of substituting others. Followers of Montalbano  are too attached to the characters. So they came up with the Young Montalbano prequel. This sort of thing never works, and yet this time it does. The same qualities that made the original series so popular are evident here. Even though this is a prequel, the stories stand on their own. The common thread of quality through these shows is that the writer of the Montalbano books, on which the series are based, Andrea Camilleri, has stayed directly involved in the productions. He obviously loves and protects the characters.

As good as the young Montalbano is, I think most viewers will wish that they had started with the original Montalbano series. If you haven't seen the original shows, a lot of the references in the Young Montalbano can not be deciphered. The whole Montalbano experience is wonderfully addictive. I have recommended the Montalbanos to many folks and everyone is hooked. And you will pick up a little Sicilian, which is quite distinct from Italian!

5322404,5,B009ERK0XW,"Watching this series is like going on a visit to Sicily! With each episode one falls more and more in love with the characters, the settings, the mysteries, the food, the music. In fact, I didn't want the series to end (I think it's addictive--and so much fun!).

The Young Montalbano makes us see why the girls fall for the Old Montalbano--(bullet headed, bowlegged, and utterly charming). In this delightful backstory, set in the imaginary town of Vigata on the sea (I covet his house!!!) we meet the young Commissario, who is still bowlegged and utterly charming, but has a full mop of curly hair, and is heartthrobbingly gorgeous! (Che bellissimo!)

The writers and directors have enhanced the plausibility of the entire story by giving us a real history to the established Montalbano series, introducing us to the younger versions of the denizens of the Questura that keeps a watchful eye on the territory between Vigata and Montelusa: Salvo Montalbano is mentored by Fazio's simpatico father; the younger Catarella is as endearingly misbegotten as the older Caterella; young Fazio, straight out of the police academy, is tack-sharp; and lady-killer Mimi Augello, with a full moustache, is full of himself.

We meet the beautiful and usually absent Livia, a perfect match for young Salvo. We also discover exactly why she is absent most of the time, as Salvo  becomes consumed with investigating local petty crimes as well as spectacular murders. Their chemistry blends so well, that we can also understand why she puts up with him after so many years in the later series. We also learn the history of the estrangement between Salvo and his father; and we discover Salvo's continuing love affair with the characteristic cuisine of Sicily, and how Adellina with her succulent -arranciate-(rice croquettes) comes into his life.

This series has everything: intriguing mysteries; glorious settings (It is shot around Ragusa); endearing characters (and every character, down to the cleaning ladies and shopkeepers, is portrayed as an individual), haunting Sicilian melodies, and a quirky sense of humor that is very Italian. It is full of gems that will have resonance for anyone who has lived in Italy and Sicily (e.g., special delivery letters sent from one end of Vigata that take five days to arrive across town).

I have not read the books, but the series has encouraged me to do so. To me, the only drawback to buying this Italian DVD--the image of which is sharp, the sound clear, the subtitles [expunged of salty language] well done--is the price, but it is definitely worth saving for--perhaps a Christmas present to oneself!

I strongly recommend ""Il Giovane Montalbano"" for anyone who loves Italy--and Sicily, of course. Watching it is the next best thing to being there!",1351987200,19,2783,5.050108932461874

5322409,5,B009ERK0XW,"I have all the Detective Montalbano series. I'ts very interesting going back in time to see when he was young. The lead actor does a great job playing Montalbano. I love that they use the same house, police station.",1421712000,,215,4.538461538461538

5322412,4,B009ERK0XW,Not as good as Montalbano in the main series.  Character does not seem to have quite captured the likeable nature of the main character.,1410998400,,136,4.666666666666667
5322413,3,B009ERK0XW,The cover is the best thing about the series.  Only episode 6 of the entire series really gets off the ground.,1410739200,,110,4.238095238095238
5322414,4,B009ERK0XW,love this series. Hope it get renewed. Casting is amazing. Michael Riondino is charming and fits the character right down to the bowed legs. Great acting all around and like the original series easy to read subtitles.,1407024000,,217,4.891891891891892
5322415,5,B009ERK0XW,The acting is excellent and the stories are engaging,1405814400,,52,4.888888888888889
5322416,5,B009ERK0XW,"I'm impressed that the writer could go back in his mind, to how his character would be 20 years earlier in his life. And how all the other characters in the Montalbano world would be also. My assessment is that it fits perfectly and you get a double enjoyment of seeing the here and now but also knowing the future and how it will be. It makes me sad when I think about Livia in the future as I see how fresh and happy she is in the present. I see Fazzio's father and can understand his future son better. And Mimi does somehow mature and grow up, but you can see  it will  take time a lot of work.",1405382400,2,598,3.975
5322417,5,B009ERK0XW,This is a wonderful way to see how Montalbano all started. The acting is great and it explains a lot about the characters.,1400630400,,122,4.3478260869565215
5322418,5,B009ERK0XW,"Young Montalbano as funny as the the episodes 1-3.
Detective series Italian style, solving crimes and at the same time focus on eating and having wine.
Caterella always funny; great acting. Fazio taking in stride Salvo Montalbano's outbursts and Mimi always in trouble not doing much. great acting from all of them.",1398643200,,315,5.076923076923077
5322419,5,B009ERK0XW,"Utterly incredible series of stories of the young Montalbano.  He is a charmer, complicated, funny, driven.  And the acting is superior.",1394582400,,136,5.428571428571429
5322420,4,B009ERK0XW,"This series is a superior detective series, with humor and reality mixed.  it's best watched after viewing the older Montalbano series , though.",1394150400,,144,5.260869565217392
5322421,4,B009ERK0XW,"I didn't want to watch this after the real Montalbano
ended. But the pull to Italian got me to try
it. Too my surprise I liked it very much",1392508800,,139,3.8275862068965516
5322422,4,B009ERK0XW,"not the good old montalbano, but something to fill the loss.  No one can get that old montalbano crew going the way it was. hopefully they will come back.",1381881600,,154,4.310344827586207
5322423,5,B009ERK0XW,"See my review of Episodes 1-3.  These are terrific stories, great characters, terrific eye-candy!  I highly recommend these and all other episodes of this series AND of the original Montalbano series starring Luca Zingarelli.",1375488000,,225,5.588235294117647
5322424,5,B009ERK0XW,"I only wish there were more than 6 episodes. This is my favorite detective series. And several of my friends with whom I have reluctantly shared my DVD's, were hooked after viewing the first one.",1374364800,2,195,4.6
5322425,5,B009ERK0XW,"I bought this because I watched all the Montalbano originals and liked them , too.  The Young Montalbano is an excellent actor and the whole cast does a fantastic job.  I am hoping they make some more of these programs as 6 is not enough.
I will buy them and I recommend them to people of any age.  There is humor, pathos, and suspense.  Do not hesitate to buy it.",1372896000,,364,4.1571428571428575
5322426,5,B009ERK0XW,"Authentic portrayal of Sicily as a setting like all others for both the best and the worst of human life.  The language is a blend of authentic Sicilian and standard Italian, each in its own proper place.  The acting is just superb.  I recommend it especially for all heirs of the Sicilian tradition in this country as well as for all lovers of detective drama.  Classy.  Well done.  Long overdue.",1372636800,,397,4.6
5322427,5,B009ERK0XW,"I love the mystery detective series ""Commissario Montalbano"" and this series was a natural spinoff, explaining Montalbano's early career as he becomes the director of the detective bureau in a small Sicilian port town near his childhood home, and establishes the marvelous characters that surround him. Salvo is brilliant, intuitive, and does not suffer fools gladly, and it's all established here. You can start with this great series, or as I think you were meant to, wait until after you see the ""mature""  Montalbano. Just one episode and you will be hooked.",1371340800,,561,5.0978260869565215
5322428,1,B009ERK0XW,I was really shocked to find that I had been sent a dvd that I could not watch as I am live in the uk and this dvd cannot be played here.  I checked the cover and found that this product  should not have been sold outside of the USA or Canada.  I cant understand why they sent it to me.  I am still waiting to hear from the seller.  I am so disappointed,1368403200,,353,3.7162162162162162
5322429,5,B009ERK0XW,"Inspector Montalbano has been one of my favorite fictional characters since I started reading (and viewing) his adventures. I sometimes think of him as ""real."" Now, to see him as a young man, I can almost confirm his authenticity. Michele Riondo is totally believable as a young Luca Zingaretti.  Love the plots and other members of the Vigata police department. Can't wait for more of both series and hope there will be more soon. Keep them coming Andrea...........",1367539200,,466,4.9743589743589745

5322431,5,B009ERK0XW,"We had low expectations for the prequel. But it is as good as the original Montalbano series, which means very good indeed. The quality of filming and acting is at a very high level and we certainly were not disappointed.",1366156800,2,221,4.55
5322432,5,B009ERK0XW,"We love the Young Montalbano series.  The plots are excellent and the acting is superb and believable.  We recommend the series to anyone who can watch and read english subtitles.  The action has a great deal of humor, too.",1359849600,,223,4.666666666666667
5322433,5,B009ERK0XW,"Better than anything you can see on American TV. Great stories. Great Acting. And of course, Italy. If you can't go there right now, this is the next best thing. As good as set 1.",1358035200,3,179,4.142857142857143

8540661,5,B009ERK0XW,"Wonderful detective series, especially for someone who loves the beautiful island of Sicily and for someone learning Italian.  This is a fun series - a prequel to Commissario Montalbano, which is also excellent.  Great way to listen to Italian (and Sicilian) while looking at the beautiful scenery in Sicily.  This is one to watch again and again.  Plus, Michele Riondino (Salvo Montalbano) is adorable!",1462320000,,403,5.25

8540663,5,B009ERK0XW,"I have every Montalbano, DVD made, the older ones and these new ones and my husband and I love them all.  There is so much to see of Southern Italy, what a treat,  and we love the characters and their interplay with one another.  The stories are good, too - some great some just good but all are interesting.  I hope they make more of the Young Montalbano.  We sure miss the older one but these help make up for the old series ending. .  I hope these Young Montalbano ones go on for just as long.",1450310400,,496,4.061855670103093
