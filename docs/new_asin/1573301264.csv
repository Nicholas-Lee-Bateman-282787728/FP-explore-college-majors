7798187,2,1573301264,"This film is inspired by Piranesi, who left us with etchings of the Carceri (prison). The inspiration is: if we build a virtual Carceri based on the etchings, and record a piece of music (in this case, it is Ma playing Bach's Second Suite for Unaccompanied Cello) there, what would the sonic effect be?
The important thing here is the virtual realisation of 2-D drawings into a 3D structure and the recording of music there. Who plays who's what music is relatively unimportant. For example, there is no reason why Ma can't instead play the Third Suite or a Piazolla tango piece in the prison!
I can't see what the film has got to do with ""inspired by Bach"".
Actually, a viewer can ask even more critical questions: Why Piranesi? What's so special about the Carceri etchings? I don't think the film offers convincing answers.",978480000,,825,4.696551724137931
7798188,4,1573301264,"The second in a series of six collaborations of cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and a number of different creative talents, creating multi-media presentations and interpretations of the J.S Bach Suites for Unaccompanied Cello. Here,  Ma takes his inspiration for a performance of the Suite Number 2, from the  ""Carceri"" (prison) etchings of the 18th century Italian architect  Giovanni Piranesi, and works with film makers, sound technicians, and a digital artist to create scenes within the Piranesi images.  Ma is placed digitally within the Piranesi scenes, and I found the effect dramatic and pleasing, rather than contrived.  Ma works with particular attention to the  sound production, and the conversations between Ma and the sound  technician, recorded live and at  some length, reveal depths of  understanding of the impact of the music and of production, on both the  performer and the listener. In my opinion, worth owning -- I bought the series.  58  minutes long, in colour.",939600000,3,973,5.246753246753247
