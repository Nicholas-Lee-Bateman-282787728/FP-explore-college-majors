4719288,3,B005L2EOMC,"While this is a fun disc and a beautiful print of the film, you do not actually get either the K Gordon Murray or the original Mexican versions of the film.  What you do get is an edited down copy of the Mexican version so it fits the American version's soundtrack.  But you don't get the American version's opening credits when you watch it, or the US names of the countries when Santa is playing his organ, checking in on his workshop.  And you do not get the extended dance number in Hell that was in the Mexican version when you watch that option.  Those things are included in the extras as deleted scenes, with the sound on the US version of the kids singing the songs from their countries sequence off by about 10 to 20 seconds.  so yea, they found a way to make that bit even more annoying.  To me, including what's missing as an extra doesn't count as actually getting both versions. The info on the back of the case lists separate running times for the US and Mexican versions.  As far as I can tell it's the same film, just different sound tracks, so both versions run the same time.  Should also mention that the Making Of Featurette is the same Santa Claus Conquerors The Devil video that was included on the MST3K DVD release of their version of this film.  Don't get me wrong though, it's a lot of fun, the short films included as extras make the feature film look like Citizen Kane.  And the copy of the film looks like it was filmed yesterday, just beautiful.  It's just that the main selling point for me was to have the two different versions, and what you buy instead is as close to what they could get of one or the other, without giving you either.",1323475200,29,1670,4.32051282051282

VCI, a DVD publisher, has just announced ( at the Home Theater Forum web site)today their Christmas releases, which includes this motion picture. While the release date & SRP haven't been announced (yet), the film has been restored from a 35mm negative, which means it should be head & shoulders above the current released edition. This 1959 motion picture will be released on November 11th 2011, and has a SRP of $14.99 from it's publisher's web site (VCI). As soon as Amazon has a pre-order place holder up & running I will be ordering my copy ""ASAP""...HO...HO...HO...have fun :)
...And In Addition: the version priced at $19.99 SRP is the ""Blue Ray"" edition & the version priced at $9.99 SRP is the spanish-language ""only"" edition of this VCI release. The $14.99 SRP is the standard DVD english-language edition of this release. All three editions of this release will appear when using the following search term ""Santa Claus"". I hope this clarifies what Amazon has so far failed to do with their customer listings...HUM-BUGGERY...I will be happily purchasing the $14.99 SRP version...
again, have fun :) :) :)",1315180800,9,1281,4.800904977375565

Murray version as well as the original mexican spanish version for all the people that grew up in Latin america watching this film when kids.
