I had it all memorized by the time I was seven and now, 22 year later, I still have some of it memorized. I'm excited to have it digitally as I no longer have a way to watch my VHS.",1514764800,,255,3.6545454545454548
7899356,1,6305995966,"This video was so hard to follow. But it was nice of Ms. Austin to put the instructions on how to do the line dances at THE END of the video...she didn't give any instruction during the exercise portion of the tape.  I was confused so I just turned off the tape.  My advice, don't waste your money.",1032566400,,298,4.120689655172414
