1884268,5,B00009MECU,"Awesome. THis series is the one that got me interested in anime. Every episode is great except for the fifth; ""brittle bullet"" which happens to be on this volume. However, ""FLCLimax"" the other  episode on this DVD, and the final episode in the series is amazing and is worth the price if just sold alone. Every episode including these is structured like this:
Prolouge-First 5 minutes- serious, good cinematography, some story revealed
Part A-middle 12 minutes- no sense whatsoever. You can try, but to figure out the story you have to watch it over and over and over again.
Part B-Last 12 minutes- Climax, always really good, strong graphics and sound. Ends on a good note.
Thats i for my review.
P.S. By the way, in the english version Foolly Coolly is the name of Mamimi's Picture, just so you know.",1062201600,2,802,4.6879432624113475
1884269,5,B00009MECU,"what can i say? fooly cooly is not something you can easily write about, or explain or talk about.  the plot is almost ridiculous, and it fits the whole mood of ""screwed up for the sake of being screwed up.""  despite this, there are many clever allusions; like a scene that copies the opening credits for ""Lupin the 3rd"", and references to Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Machine (two bands i love).  eh, just watch it.  its pure genius.  when you can take something as messed up as this anime and make it invoke real emotions, you know you've done something amazing.",1061424000,,578,4.466666666666667
1884270,5,B00009MECU,"I first saw this show a little over a week ago on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.  I was instantly hooked.  It's a dangerously addicting show.  The animation and soundtrack are amazing.  It has everything other shows do not, but all good.  I never really watched anime in the past but this show has personality that you can't help but love.  It is a bit pricey but this is the best deal you can find.  Believe me, I've looked.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.",1061251200,,463,4.3023255813953485
1884271,5,B00009MECU,"If anyone had told me this was similar to Excel Saga, I never would have bothered checking it out. There's no denying that FLCL is absolutely out of its mind insane, but it has a certain... something... that Excel lacked. Edge? Wit? Conspiritoriality? (I don't think that's an actual word...) Heart? Charisma? All of the above? Whereas Excel instantly grated on my nerves and annoyed the hell out of me, FLCL kept me amused and interested and entertained for the duration.",1059955200,2,472,4.839506172839506
1884272,5,B00009MECU,"I'd say the best description would be like jumping out of an airplane, at first you are really holding back and feel slightly nervous.  I mean this is one anime that's out there, but in the end it has a very pleasant, yet powerful ending.  I would give this 5 stars because the series included an excellent soundtrack, crisp animation, and enough action/insanity to keep you entertained the entire time.
  I'd essentially say the series reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes on steroids mixed with Invader Zim meeting the world of anime.  The series has an interesting plot unlike any I've ever seen, which will most likely leave most confused, but it's still very appealing and enjoyable.  I believe this is a series that you aren't exactly meant to get it, but it's also not meant to be intimidating or overexamined.
  The soundtrack has just enough J-Rock to keep the soundtrack lively, and at the same time is very fitting to the series and helps to establish mood and theme very effectively.
  Finally the collector's edition box!  This is really what sold me, I saw the box and just thought it was one of the most creative, yet well done boxes for a boxed set I've seen for a long time.  It's also much sturdier than most of the boxes I've gotten for other series.
  The dvd only has two episodes, but when looking at the overall picture, I was extremely satisified despite there being only two episodes.  The dvd has commentary by the original Japanese director (something I think all anime dvd's should have).  There was also a pleasant music video of the end credit song by The Pillows.  Last of all, the liner notes are extremely good, it includes an actual manga section, along with some notes about the translation and a few little well done extras.
  In conclussion, I'd say that the actual anime is excellent, and although only having two on one dvd seems cheap, it's really an alright deal.  The extras included with the DVD make it an even better purchase and deal, which is why if you're into weird/off the wall stuff, you should really check this out.",1059177600,,2063,4.615384615384615
1884273,5,B00009MECU,"I would be hard pressed to find a more confusing anime than FLCL, and that's saying a lot for this genre. Then again it isn't all that surprising coming from studio GAINAX, those who brought us all the way to The End of Evangelion. FLCL is certainly one of their more ""down to earth"" films at it's heart and is surprisingly simple to analyze once you either ignore or accept the mayhem. The second to last and last episodes are on this DVD which bring this series to an acceptable and nevertheless ambiguous conclusion. In the fifth episode they show their true colors applying more Matrix inspired ""bullet time"" fight scenes and successfully parodying everything real or animated including South Park. But that is simply for the enjoyment of those who know the references. And in true GAINAX fashion the writer, director and animator lose their last inkling of sanity in bringing this production to a finale. To get a sense of this (and this is not a spoiler) simply look at the cover of this DVD, taken from a frame in the last few scenes. Overall I do wish the series was longer, but I think that would lose some charm if that were the case. Frankly I think it is some of the best animation Production IG  has done along with some of the most imaginative storytelling(?) I have seen. To cap it off, a warning to those light of heart, and a shameless promotion: I highly and humbly recommend this series, the last episodes will without a doubt blow your mind.",1052438400,24,1461,4.534090909090909
1884334,5,B00009MECU,"Words cannot describe the final two episodes of FLCL. The unbelievible sensation of your jaw 16 inches from your face will make you watch them over and over agian. Which is necessary because after your first time, you will find yourself lost, saying: What the #$%@ did i just watch? The show may seem a bunch of random crazyness, but that is only the first layer. Below this is a very plot-driven twist of jelousy, pain, acceptence, denial, love, and growing up. I am not a fan of anime, but this is much more than anime. It is not crazy people fighting creatures for no reason. This is genius....

1884335,5,B00009MECU,"The first time I saw this was at an anime club viewing. At first I wasn't sure what to make of it. There is a lot on the screen at one time. However, I wasn't at all annoyed by the liberal use of slapstick humor and character distortion. This anime manages to be both ridiculous and adult in its sensibility. Let me clarify that:

Imagine taking Peanuts, old Warner Bros. cartoons, Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Dr. Who as concepts. Then combine all of them in a parallel dimension of modern Japan. Set this to a highly sexualized, but not explicit, comming-of-age story. With aliens. And robots. I hate doing reviews that boil down to, ""It's like X combined with Y."" Rather, think of this as a setup, to get your mind in the mood. FLCL itself is a true original, however.

Technical notes: Though most will, of course, prefer subtitles, the English dub is very well executed. Graphically, this is very dense. Unlike many animes that try to squeeze as much screen time out of a cell as possible, FLCL is a collage of movement, lighting, and changing ""camera angles."" The soundtrack by the Pillows is impressive. None of that corporate jpop, made-for-twelve-yr-olds filth. This band is seriously good.

This is a great, highly original anime, and one of my favorites. Great for adults and adolescents. Particularly good for those who appreciate sci-fi along the lines of Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchet.

On a final note, I have to disagree with ""Karl."" It would seem from his suggestions that he's probably more of a hentai fan. And there's nothing wrong with that. :) But, I doubt that it was plot that he found lacking in this series...",1127779200,8,1647,4.688581314878893
1884336,5,B00009MECU,"After the first episode, one may dismiss Fooly Cooly as an anime devoid of plot and filled to the brim with unnecessary wackiness. However, as one gets into the series, they will quickly realize how wrong they were; though only six episodes, this anime expertly blends Japanese culture with American slapstick.

Tsurumaki's Fooly Cooly deftly balances cool with fool; it inserts the hilarious moments in all the right places while keeping on target with the plot. The the music from the Japanese band The Pillows keeps the ""cool"" right in place while the chaos of many scenes gives us the ""fool"", reminding some of us of the American slapstick cartoons that we used to watch when we were young. Also, the animation itself is nothing to sneeze at; the creator animates each character fluidly and we beign to realize that the motions of each character gives us the personality of each; Haruko jumps from here to there on screen, giving us the impression of her strange personality, while Ninamure hardly every moves, impressing upon us her dominant mellow mood.

When people first watch Fooly Cooly, they initially think that the series is either strange or nonsensical or, at extremes, garbage. But when they get into it, they quickly change their minds. The blend of cool and fool in this series makes it the perfect way to start off a newcomer to anime.",1112572800,5,1354,4.831896551724138
1884337,4,B00009MECU,"Well, here's the end of it all.  If it wasn't so friggin' good, and the followup OAV DEAD LEAVES didn't feel like such a pathetic attempt to ""take it up a notch,"" I might want the series to go on.  Instead I'll have to watch it a dozen times more, and marvel that they smacked it SO righteously out of the park (by they I mean GAINAX and PRODUCTION I.G.)!  This is the kind of stuff that redefines where animation could go...
  No matter what people might say, just pay attention, go with its flow, and FLCL makes perfect sense.  Might make better sense if you don't watch tons of anime actually.  At its heart, its just about growing up and being a man, dammit!
  So my friends turned me on to this a couple of years ago, its the best anime in memory, and reinvigorates my interest in the genre.  Nothing since has touched its perfection.  Short and sweet, spastic as hell, and the dynamics between the characters are bombastic.  Its pretty much a distillation and collage of everything in anime since the 90's hit, a punk-rocking parody that suddenly begins to take itself seriously, then upheaves everything.
  If you take away all the religious underpinnings and focused on Shinji's sexual tension with older/younger women in all twenty-six+ episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but shoved that in only six episodes, and stuck said confused pubescent boy with the ""worst girl for you at the best time"" you've pretty much got the narrative.  Soundtrack by the PILLOWS alone makes it a classic, it rocks like a J-pop PIXIES.
  I give the series itself 5 stars [...] the bonuses aren't that great[...].  ""Lord of the Rings:Return of the King"" is longer than the whole series combined and costs only $30! [...] I could ALMOST understand 2 volumes at that price since the series narrative naturally splits at the middle anyways...  but its still a MUST SEE.
  I recommend getting a used copy if you can't afford the steep tag.

1884338,4,B00009MECU,"FLCL was surprisingly a good anime. It's name (Fooly Cooly) might throw some off. Just think of the name as the creators way of expressing the uniqueness of this anime. I'll admit that I don't prefer to many animes that have alot of gimicks and comedy. I usually prefer more serious animes such as Serial Experiments Lain, but this FLCL has definately put forth the effort. So why did I only give it a 4 star rating if I have nothing negative to say about it, some may ask. The reason is simple. It's just to damn short.",1090108800,7,520,4.316326530612245
1884339,5,B00009MECU,"This DVD contains the last two episodes of the ridiculously hilarious show FLCL.
In the first of these two, Brittle Bullet, we see more action with General Amarao, who first appeared last episode.  For those of you not too great with names, that's the guy with red hair and huge dark green eyebrows which occasionally fall off.  His confrontation with Haruko is just one of the things to look forward to in this episode.  The others include Kitsurabami (his assistant) getting a crush on Canti, Naota going off the deep end a little, a huge fake gun fight, a a giant gunslinging robot that comes out of Naota's head and starts shooting a 100-ft. long shotgun at Haruko, who's wearing a ridiculous bunnygirl suit and toting a slingshot.
The second episode is FLCLimax, and it is indeed the climax.  In this one, everything that has been growing throughout the series will come out to create a truly insane sequence.  At its core (very, very deep) FLCL is a love story about Haruko and Naota, and we finally see the resolution of that in this episode.  I'm not going to tell you how it ends, but I'll leave on word:  Atomsk.  Oh, and did I mention another Manga sequence?
Ultimately, while this series is constantly bizarre and often innappropriate, I still find it one of the most hilarious and wonderful series I have ever seen.  Perhaps this is because it transcends everything else I have ever seen, becoming something that does not really fit into any category.  Whatever it is, it is a great show, one not to be missed.",1089158400,10,1523,4.628252788104089
1884340,1,B00009MECU,"Why is good anime often under represented or under understood (if that is a word)? Greed. FLCL is a great anime. But it's only 6 episodes at around 3 hrs. Yet somehow the DVD makers felt is necessary to split a 3-hour series over 3 DVDs and charge nearly $30.00 bucks a piece for them. I don't buy my anime in the U.S. I buy it overseas. Sure I may have to read subtitles, and I might occasionally even unintentionally be purchasing a pirated property (which I try to avoid by usually buying from a select number of dealers and by paying attention to the name of the DVDs' producers) but when I can buy an entire 26-episode series (like Cowboy Bebop or Witch Hunter Robin) on 3 DVDs for less than the price of one of those DVDs in the U.S. that only has three or four episodes of the same series (with all the ""extras"" - some sketchbook drawings & trailers for other DVDs aren't exactly extras in my book!), I'll pick reading any day (especially since dubbed English DVDs are becoming more prevalent overseas). DVD producers will say that they have to charge that much because it's a niche market, etc. All I can think is that it will never stop being a niche market until people can see an entire series without having to pay $100.00-$300.00 to watch it.",1083542400,28,1255,4.390557939914163
1884341,5,B00009MECU,"For those who were waiting for the release of the last two episodes of this chaotic series, hoping for some semblance of sanity to prevail, I have a bit of bad news.  Director Kazuya Tsurumaki has never intended FLCL to be anything else but a tongue in cheek romp through the byroads of anime gone manic.  The in-jokes, references, and puns - the incredible juxtaposition of incongruity and fan service - was intended to confuse even its original audience of Japanese anime fans.  For us in North America all we can do is hold our hats and enjoy it for what it is - creativity and self expression for its own sake.
Naota and his father Kamon square off in a paintball/survival game for the right to claim Haruka.  As if anyone could claim Haruka.  Instead, a frantic series of event triggers another of Naota's mental abherrations and Mamimi and he scramble for survival as a giant hand prepared to attack the clothes iron in the sky.  Then by a sort of pinball segue we arrive in the final episode, only temporarily safe.  Now Naota must deal with Haruka's love/have relationship with a disguised semi-divine pirate.
Despite this drunkards walk of a plot, the illustration and animation are remarkable.  Both Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (character design) and Hiroaki Ogura (art direction) refuse to compromise, and the result is far more than a zany comedy.  The visual message is that something really is going on, even if it takes using vintage guitars as weapons to get there.
I hope that summary clears up any dangling insecurities you might have.  FLCL is anime as if it was written by Nietzche and illustrated by Hieronymus Bosch.  It is brilliant, twisted and full of intentional random juxtapositions.  Repeatedly, in the interviews, director Tsurumaki responds to questions about 'why' with a chuckle and a shrug.  As Naota says at the end, ""Nothing amazing happens here...""",1082246400,6,1876,4.861635220125786
1884342,5,B00009MECU,"This is by far my favorite anime, and though at first you WON'T understand the plot (this is almost a guarantee) but eventually it will dawn on you. To figure out the significance of the show, you have to pay attention to every spoken line, if you do this, you will learn how complex the series is. I may as well go ahead and tell you now so you don't have to watch it 20 times like i did, being a millenium anime the show revolves around armegeddon (through multiple references to things like Nostradamus and a ""god"" of the black flame, and one other that escapes me). Anyone who says that there is no plot/purpose and they don't understand it hasn't watched it enough, or was biased against to begin with. Definitely a great buy, well worth the price.

1884355,3,B00009MECU,I don't think this series is as great as people make it seem.  The best thing about this series is the weird animation and soundtrack.  The plot is okay but didn't strike me with any provoking thoughts.  I finished the series because I wanted to see how it ended and it was just so weird in the beginning that I couldn't just not finish it.  I would watch/borrow this first before buying... and maybe buy the bootleg just to have something weird to show off.,1070323200,6,458,4.352941176470588
1884356,5,B00009MECU,"The stylistic achievement is simply stunning. Very few, if any, TV anime ever reach this level of eye-candy gorgeousness. Gainax's FLCL combines the palette subtleties of the best of Studio Ghibli with its own distinct character designs, action gestures and emotional expressions. Hilarious manga-style sequences AND this volume's 'Brittle Bullets' features a riff on South Park's faux-construction paper style.
If you've never seen FLCL before, just relax, have an open mind and let this bizarrely wonderful world take you in. Let the stream-of-consciousness story wash over you like a KoolAid waterfall. You'll want to see it again just to make sure you saw what you saw the first time.",1069027200,20,688,5.321100917431193
1884357,5,B00009MECU,"This has got to be one of, if not _the_ best anime I've seen.  It seems to stimulate a part of the brain that's not normally given much attention, so it's hard to accept at first.  The music is top-notch, the animation is high quality, and it runs the gamete of emotions--sadness, laughter, happiness, anger, confusion...
In some way, it reminds me of Fear & Loathing in LV (the movie) as it shocks and confuses you so much the first few times that you don't see the cool story and little details until later viewings.
And under all that, there even is a nifty story (even if not altogether original in anime).

7991454,5,B00009MECU,"Please tell me you never expected a NORMAL ending to the weirdest anime in history, ""FLCL."" What does Fooly Cooly mean anyway?

Anyway, the already-freakish storylines of ""FLCL"" reach spectacular new heights in the third and final volume, in which we discover the plots of the Medical Mechanica, Haruko's true goals, and the looming threat to all of Earth! It's a bit like watching a sci-fi movie and a kids' cartoon, while ingesting large amounts of acid -- and then some.

After Kamon finds Haruko smooching Naota, he challenges his son to a duel -- resulting in a guerilla-style battle in a grassy field with air guns. In the meantime, Haruko dukes it out with the Department of Interstellar Immigration and Amarao (who seems to have had a prior relationship with her. And when Naota tries to act grown-up and manly around Mamimi, his head suddenly sprouts the largest robot yet -- a giant hand that doubles as a cloaked gunslinger!

Then it's time for the FoolyClimax -- after Haruko goes absent for awhile, Naota decides to escape his boring life and go on the road with her. Amarao is searching for the Terminal Core that will activate the giant hand, and gives Naota some odd advice about the selfish, strange girl he's traveling with. And Mamimi has a new pet -- a robot that she gleefully feeds with her enemies' cell phones and motorcycles.

When the Hand is finally activated, will Medical Mechanica's diabolical plans be fulfilled? What ARE their diabolical plans? Who is the great Space Pirate Atomsk, and what will be the final thing to spring from Naota's head?

It's hard to find an anime that is full of as much unadulterated crackiness and wackiness as ""FLCL,"" and the last two (of six) episodes of the series may actually be the weirdest of this all-too-short series. Not many series could string together aliens, motorbikes, truck-swallowing robot cats and blatant South Park homages in a convoluted coming-of-age tale. All that, and it has crazy alien chicks who dress like Elvis.

The first of these two stories is a sort of slow buildup: we get the origins of the vast hand, and the long-running feud between Haruko and the freaky-browed Amarao. Then the final episode erupts like a volcano of surreal sci-fi, flinging Naota into a maelstrom of giant robots, interstellar conspiracies, and sexual symbolism (lookit that giant robot smashing between Mamami's feet!). And no series can have dialogue half as weird as this (""That's discriminatory language used against undeveloped planets!"").

Admittedly it answers a few questions raised before, if you can call stuff about smoothing brain wrinkles an answer. But most of them are left flapping merrily in the breeze, and somehow you don't really care because it was too entertaining.

Despite all the kissing with older girls, Naota really becomes an adolescent here -- he's got the hormones and the intense romantic feelings, but he's also still recognizably a fragile kid. And we finally see why Haruko has been using Naota's head and what her ultimate goal is -- it turns out she's even weirder than we thought. And Amarao seems to have been her admirer in the past (""Where are your eyebrows? Why did you take them off?"").

The grand slam finale of ""FLCL"" is a double dose of bizarre and a quadruple eruption of pure bizarrity -- and the biggest problem with it is that you don't want it to end. Ever. Fooly cooly!",1243555200,,3389,4.839378238341969

I have tried 3 times to watch this FLCL - which is one of the most popular series. I stopped during the 1st episode because I didn't understand anything. 6 months passed...... I tried to watch again last week. During episode 4, I fell asleep. Ok..... I was thinking.... ????. Again, yesterday, I finished watching the last 2 episodes which should give me the answer based on the other people reviews. But I didn't get any answer. I am so sure that I am missing ""something"". I love the song very much. :)",1174953600,,624,4.530973451327434
7991456,5,B00009MECU,"This series must get an award for simple originality. None of the characters follow the same anime stereotypes we've come to know as anime fans. The conflict is everchanging but never out of reach. You always know what is going on, in other words. And to add to that, it has a great J-pop soundtrack. If you're tired of those stories about a male Japanese boy surrounded by many beatiful women--and who isn't--this is where to go to regenerate your love for this type of anime.",1131321600,2,477,4.558139534883721
