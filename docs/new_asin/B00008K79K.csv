1849126,4,B00008K79K,"I first saw Princess Daisy on WE.  I didn't know what it was or what it was about, but i was immediately hooked on it.  Merete van Kamp, who plays Daisy, is beautiful, graceful, and elegant, and Rupert everett, as Ram (Daisy's step brother who falls in love with her) is stunningly handsome.  But not only are the actors beautiful, but the story is captivating.  The acting isn't fabulous, the screenplay is at times cheesy, but all in all, it was very entertaining and i watched all three hours of this soap-opera-ish movie, and in the end decided that i thoroughly enjoyed it!",1023840000,26,578,4.58252427184466
7984895,2,B00008K79K,The Incorrect Item Was Sent to Me And I cannot get ANYONE to respond to help me get it resolved.  All I want is the correct item and instructions on how to return what I have. The Disc is NOT compatible to my DVD/Blu-ray player but it is not advertised that way by the seller - I am familiar and careful with purchases for this reason and there is no indication this product will not work on American Made equipment - Help - Kim Holmes,1515715200,,435,4.117647058823529

7984899,5,B00008K79K,"Of all the miniseries made from the books of Judith Krantz this is my personal favorite. I first saw it years ago on VHS but I missed it when it came out on DVD. Now of course if you want a copy you can play on an American DVD player you have to be willing to pay a small fortune for what is basically a long, soapy TV movie. Till now I as much as I wanted to see it again I said ""Nope"" because the sums being asked for this trashy little gem are just too much for my wallet. A couple of days ago a pal of mine online told me something I didn't know, that VLC media player can play any DVD even those for other regions if you open said DVD from somewhere else via a computer that has this program installed on it. Given I already use it for playing video and given there are UK copies of this film from $4 in existence guess what I just ordered off Amazon? :P Yup, I can live with seeing it again on my computer.

I thought the casting on this miniseries was a bit better than on some of the others. Rupert Everett was just wonderful in this as the twisted Ram. Keach and Wagner work better here than in some other Krantz roles, and Merete van Kamp is actually quite good as the twins Daisy and Dani. The most fun performance in the film though by far is Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach who are perfect in their roles. It's totally high camp and wonderful. It made me laugh so hard watching them.

I just wish they'd release this one again in the USA format. It deserves it. The rest of her miniseries I can take or leave. I watched them once, enjoyed them mostly, but not this one. This one is a keeper!  I'd watch this one at least once a year just for the sheer fun of it....",1462147200,,1675,3.994029850746269

7984904,4,B00008K79K,"This 1983 mini series is typical of such series produced in the 1980s. It tells the enjoyable tale of Princess Daisy from birth to the moment she finds true love.
I was particularly interested in the fine performnaces of the majority of the cast in particular Rupert Everett and the late Robert Urich.
This is an ideal buy for anyone who loves a bit of a romantic fairy tale.
Enjoy.",1332720000,,382,4.4714285714285715
