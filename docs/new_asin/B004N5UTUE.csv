4503212,5,B004N5UTUE,"This is a fantastic series, but this season 2 picks up 9 episodes after season 1 ends. There's a complete list on Wikipedia. The series was apparently released in two versions, with one of them having the 'as seen on GMC' note. If you start with one set, keep on with it. The two sets can't be mixed and matched very well, as you'll find yourself with missing or overlapping episodes. Hopefully this will help others avoid confusion when Episode 1 of Season 2 starts off with ""previously on Heartland""... only to be full of characters and storylines that weren't on Season 1!",1346025600,18,575,4.592233009708738
4503213,5,B004N5UTUE,"I juasr started watching Heartland on GMC Channel 188 in 2012. It is the most enjoyable show. Those kids can really ride. Especilly Amy. It is so clean and family oriented. It is hard to find this kind of entertainment on television these days. Absolutely love it. If you like horses and normal families you will love Heartland. That is the lifestyle for me. Sincerely, PJA",1344988800,,373,4.666666666666667
4503214,5,B004N5UTUE,It was a great series for all the family and at time you could get relate to yourself when you were growing up,1343174400,,110,3.8260869565217392
4503215,5,B004N5UTUE,"This spring, my sister and I saw a commercial on GMC (Gospel Music Channel) for a television show called Heartland that would be aired from the beginning of the series. We decided to watch and see if we liked it. We LOVE this show and watched each Wednesday night when two episodes were aired. Waiting for the next week was difficult, as the characters are so likable and the stories so well written and acted. I decided to purchase Seasons 1-4 so that we could watch whenever we wanted and not have to wait for Wednesday nights. There is never a dull moment as Amy's mother, Marion, is killed in an accident in the very first episode and she, and her sister, Lou, and their grandfather, Jack, have to keep Heartland ranch running. Ty and Mallory become important members of the Bartlett-Fleming family and Jack loves and guides all four of the younger characters. There are other characters that, in the beginning, you may not like, but will grow to love over time - Caleb and Ashley. We have watched every episode in Seasons 1-4 and can honestly say that there is not a single episode that we did not enjoy. Each one was excellent. We even purchased A Heartland Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. The viewer learns a lesson along with the characters as they work with the horses and each other that leaves you feeling good at the end of the hour. There are many shows on television today that have no plot or characters with any depth. Heartland certainly stands above so much of what is on television. It is something that anyone, young or old, can watch and enjoy. The location (Alberta, Canada, in the Rocky Mountains) is absolutely gorgeous as well and adds even more to the show. We cannot wait for the fifth season (and future seasons) and we will purchase the DVDs as soon as they are available.",1342310400,2,1816,4.556574923547401

4503224,5,B004N5UTUE,"What can I say. Heartland is a very delightful series.  The characters are good people, however they are not so super sweet.  They are believable characters warts and all.

The story lines are fantastic. These stories are centered around a working ranch with emphasis on helping horses recover from physical and mental abuse. The story lines also are about the characters on the show, in particular Amy and Ty, who are always growing and evolving.  They are both healing from problems in their lives.",1485475200,,500,4.916666666666667

And maybe the endings are a little predictable, but they keep it entertaining and once in a while even a little surprising.  The director is taking greater advantage of the awesome beauty of the mountains in that area than was used in Season 1, and I love the music.

They feel like a family and you find yourself rooting for them and wanting to see what happens next. Interestingly enough, this show isn't built on action, special effects, violence or super human abilities....it's about normal people doing and experiencing normal things for the most part. They have heart break, love, laughter, friendship, squabbles, pettiness and forgiveness without a bunch of preaching or unending drama. Sort of like regular people.",1479081600,,586,5.178947368421053

4503383,4,B004N5UTUE,"My family and I really enjoyed Season 1, which was wholesome and appropriate for the family, but I'm a bit disappointed with Season 2. While in Season 1, Amy, the main character, wisely tells Ty she doesn't want to jeopardize their friendship by becoming romantically involved, in Season 2 she comes across as petulant, sulky, and air-headedly pursuing Ty and then another male character. In fact, all the characters in Season 2 seem to get involved in immature relationships---not the wholesome family show I enjoyed watching with my kids in Season 1. Anyway, I haven't seen anything too inappropriate yet, but I'm disappointed with the direction it's heading. Also, my kids are disappointed that Season 2 seems to be more about these erratic relationships, people breaking up with each other then pairing off with someone else---and a lot less about Amy working with the horses, which was so much of the ""heart"" of Heartland in Season 1.",1469491200,,939,4.987261146496815

4503494,5,B004N5UTUE,"Heartland is a successful series on the Canadian Broadcasting Network (it is presently not offered in the States) that has been going strong for 9 seasons (and renewed for 10!).  The series is excellent, and you will be hooked when you begin to watch it, but you must start from the beginning because the stories intertwine.  You can purchase CDs of each season up to 8 (9 is not released yet)--since Prime only offers up to Season 3 you'll probably want to know what happens, and a lot does happen.  Season Two has fun episodes (Corporate Cowgirls and Starstruck! (often wondered if this episode was modeled after Amber Marshall and Graham Gordon's experience when they went out in public to promote the series), and we learn something about Ty in Do or Die.  Season Two builds on relationships (getting to know ones-self as well as those around you).",1464480000,,852,4.736486486486487

The story line focuses upon a family that has experienced it's share of tragedy (deaths, divorce, sickness, etc.) and celebration (love, family, etc.).

4503520,5,B004N5UTUE,I Love this show so much. I wish amazon had the newer season on here where i can buy them to stream online but they don't They only have the first three seasons with that option so hopefully the other seasons are avaiable that way in the future. So i really love this show it is a great show all the way around and it would be great for any family. I remember finding this show on netflix back in 2013. I started it and never looked back and thanks to this show i made it though that winter that year. We were having weeks of 40 below degree F weather that year it was probably the coldest winter i ever saw. If it wasn't for this show and how happy it made me feel i do not think i would have made it threw that winter. Ok maybe i would have but this just made things a little easier and made me forget how bad the cold weather really was. I really would recommend this show if you have never seen it. I hope i could convince someone else to give this show a chance. Oh by the way it is based out of Canada and i wish i could live where they film this because they land and stuff is so pretty.,1455926400,,1094,3.888392857142857

4503574,5,B004N5UTUE,"Heartland: Season Two
Airing Date: 2008-2009
Main Actors: Graham Wardle, Shaun Johnston, Amber Marshall, Michelle Morgan, Chris Potter
My rating: Five star

Heartland Season Two takes off a bit after the edge-of-a-cliff ending of Season One. The plot thickens, and it gets even better! The story-line is so tightly-woven and compelling that you can't stop at Season One...or Season Two, for that matter. The acting is superb (save a little bit of episode one only), and the scenery-the Alberta Rocky Mountains-is the perfect back-drop for the show. The way Season One ended makes you at a loss for words, and you can't help but wonder what is going to happen next-it leaves you in shock. The horses, the Rocky Mountain scenery, the country feel, and the characters are just some things that make this show better than others. It is really funny, and dramatic, thrilling, and just plain exciting.

I fell in love with the show the first season, and my obsession just keeps getting deeper with each passing season. Season Two, I have to admit, was a bit frustrating at times, but I guess good dramas are that way sometimes-something goes wrong and you wish they would just fix it already! (LOL) The show is amazing. Is. Not 'was', but is. It keeps progressing with each passing episode, and keeps getting better. The twists and turns they have in there for ya' are unexpected, and that totally makes the show so much better. You may wonder how in the world does the story stretch on for seven seasons? Well, it does...wonderfully. It is amazing, and hilarious, and just plain great! The characters get into perilous situations, over the episodes, and they always have to work out issues. I can't get the whole picture into words on this page because it's really that good. Here are five words to describe this show (which some I've already used) :D : fun, addicting, thrilling, exciting, and funny!!! Heartland is an 'ON-THE-EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT' kind of show. No 'If's', 'And's', or 'But's', this is by far my favorite show in the whole world.

4503590,5,B004N5UTUE,"I gave this 5 stars because this is the best program I've seen in quite awhile and it showed up quickly and in excellent condition.

Delivery & Quality: The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. It is a cardstock box with an opening at one end for thin, plastic dvd holders to insert in and the pictures are of good quality.

The Show: I started watching this show on Netflix and was so hooked that when they cut off mid 3rd season (one thing I hate about Netflix), I decided to just get all the DVDs so that I could continue to enjoy this program. It's about a teenage girl whose mother died and is being reared by her grandfather on a horse ranch with her sister and other characters. Her job is working with the horses as she has a special gift and understanding for them. There are many characters in the show that you'll get used to and know who they are (although new characters get introduced, there is none of this constant changing of characters like I've seen in some programs). This show is also full of adventure, love of family, and respectfulness as well as romances and life challenges. All-in-all an excellent show",1371859200,,1139,4.471153846153846

I despise the new reality shows but this is about real life. I feel like I wake up in their home and go through the day with them as I look forward to the show each week. I own the collection through the third season and never tire of watching these shows over.

I have continued to buy all the other seasons though and I have NOT been disappointed in them. I just wish someone would make others like this. It is a family oriented and clean cut which is soo refreshing these days. We don't need cursing drugs, sex, and violence in shows to truly enjoy it.

I know it is airing on a gosple channel here in the states but the episodes are seasons behind.  Make sure when ordering that it has the red border on the top.  Then you are getting what you really want.  If it has the goldenrod banner at the top it's the states version from the gosple channel and the seasons won't match.  The DVDs are good quality, sound is great, and special features all work and are enjoyable.",1361836800,,584,4.169642857142857

It was not worth the money I spent on it. I love the show but 1/2 of the second season was reruns of the 1st and there were two bad spots where it did just stopped before finishing the episode and didn't run the credits at the end.

4503621,4,B004N5UTUE,"I watched GMC's Season 1 and 2, which is CBC's Season 1, 2, and 3 1/2.
Then I watched some random episodes as aired in Canada on CBC.

There is drastic cutting and editing on every episode!  Sometimes a small non verbal scene is cut.  But sometimes important dialog is cut!  On average over 2 minutes per episode is cut from the original CBC version.  I suppose this allows more commercials in the USA, but this is a DVD!

I recommend if you want the full uncut version of Heartland as made and shown for Canadian audiences, get the CBC version.  Watch all the episodes over and you'll be amazed at what you missed the first time.",1349308800,11,630,4.333333333333333
4503622,1,B004N5UTUE,"I own EVERY Season of Heartland on DVD and every single set I have owned (bought brand new mind you) has been terrible quality. The characters look grainy and the colors are very washed out. The odd thing is that the episodes on Netflix are almost HD quality so I don't get it. It seems as though whomever is converting it to the dvds is doing a shoddy job.

My husband walked in while I was watching (he is an Engineer) and said ""Wow, that looks like a VHS"" and that is exactly what it looks like. We have two HD TVs and I have watched it on both TVs and still the same results. I think they are cutting corners and using a crappy company to do their conversions. I feel a little ripped off to be honest. Especially since I am such a loyal fan and this is one of the biggest shows in Canada so its not like they are low on budget. If you can get your episodes any other way Netflix, iTunes, etc...I would do that. I know its nice to have the box sets , but believe me when I say its not worth the $45.

Unfortunately I live in the US so I have no choice, but to buy the box sets since Netflix takes forever to post the seasons up and apparently there is a Canadian iTunes and a USA iTunes so it won't let me buy the episodes through their because they are only offered to Canadians.

If you have a choice skip the DVDS as they are terrible quality. I actually just bought Season 5 and its so grainy that I have been watching it on YouTube, thats how sad it is. I own the Dvds and I am having to resort to YouTube to watch it because the quality is so annoying. I even played one episode on Netflix on one TV and then the exact same episode from the DVD on my other TV and the difference in quality was astounding!! The Netflix version had vibrant colors and no graininess and the DVD version was very washed out (think VHS from the 90's).",1348876800,14,1839,4.032876712328767

4503625,5,B004N5UTUE,"First, to rate the show-- it fully deserves 5 stars!  It's definitely one of my (few) favorite current shows I watch.  I actually first saw the show on the ""CW Network"" in the US in late 2010, and soon afterwards caught up on all the episodes posted online (FYI, the CW network is no longer airing episodes in the US, only GMCTV).
Now, I'm current, and am awaiting the new season 6 which airs on the CBC in Canada!
**EDIT: There WILL be a Season 7 sometime around Sept. 2013!**
_____________

In regards to the dvd set I received:

This is the mistake I just figured out tonight (AFTER I removed the wrapper & discs)...  At the very bottom (the last sentence) on the back cover, it states: ""Please Note: This Package Contains Episodes 23 To 45 Of Heartland As Seen On GMCTV"".

I went online and compared the original CBC/Canadian lineup with the episodes named in the ""GMCTV's Completed Second Season"" set, and figured out that it is in fact season 2 episode 10 to season 3 episode 14 (so it's missing episodes 14 to 22 if you're like me and own the original Canadian set of the ""Complete Season One"").

FYI, Heartland in Canada has had an 18 episode run for seasons 2 to 5.

Upon further checking with different online retailers, I'm wondering if the Canadian releases are being phased out (it's getting harder and harder to find them on Amazon US, and even on eBay, even Amazon CA is selling these sets).  Although season 5 is set to release on Sept. 18 on Amazon.ca .

To sum it up, you CAN'T mix and match the releases (otherwise you will be missing episodes)!!  Decide if you want the first run/Canadian dvd's (which as I noted earlier- they appear to be phasing out), OR wait longer for GMCTV to release theirs (if they're just now beginning to air the middle of season 3 as the insert said, they may release their next set at the end of this year or early next.)
_______

P.S. I contacted Amazon to ask which version they're selling currently, because under product details it lists ""DVD Release Date: June 5, 2012""; so if they are selling the ""GMC"" labeled one, the picture needs to be changed to avoid any further confusion (the new picture has Amy & Ty, with wild horses in the background, and of course the orange bar with ""As Seen On GMC"")!
The reply was: ""I'll notify our catalog team about this and will ask them to correct the error. You'll see the change in 5-7 business days. We need to be able to verify the accuracy of new information from multiple sources.""",1346112000,50,2477,4.443708609271523
