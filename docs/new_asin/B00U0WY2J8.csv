As far as Sentai/Section23 releases go this is clearly one of its best, and to their credit it really does feel that they went above and beyond for this release. The package contains the three previously released blu rays for Mardock Scramble in one inexpensive package. As far as pricing goes? I got mine for 25 bucks, so I think this release is a steal. The names of the movies included are Mardock Scramble: The First Compression, Mardock Scramble: The Second Combustion, and Mardock Scramble: The Third Exhaust. Whereas if someone wanted to purchase these movies separately they would have to pay around twenty-five or so dollars per movie. Now anyone can own all three Mardock movies for a tad bit above the price of a single part. All the movies included are the director's cut versions as well. And there are also plenty of special features...Really, I must admit that this is a new bar set for Section23/Sentai. For their part, I don't have any issues with how they handled this release. Hell, I even thought the dub to be suitable. So kudos to them. The package arrives within a blue holographic (and very attractive) slipcase that I think accurately reflects this show's best quality: it's presentation. I'll go into more on this a little later. Before that I want to forewarn any interested viewers of this show's biggest issues.

The first issue that I had with this show was pacing.

I admit, it seems paradoxical to criticize what is ultimately an action show (based in visual qualities, no less) for moving along too quickly. After all, wouldn't one rather an action-based story to move too fast than too slow? The premise is that of a murdered prostitute who is resurrected as a Section 09 experimental combat cyborg. So the answer to that question is yes. But still, I've always subscribed to the idea that the more engaging a show is the more glaring its flaws become. While it is quite evident that, yes, Mardock Scramble is ultimately an action anime much more akin to Hellsing Ultimate or Afro Samurai than Psycho Pass or Ghost in the Shell...it doesn't seem to /want/ to be that way to anyone that watches it. Intermixed between the fast-paced and dynamic action sequences are numerous scenes devoted purely to developing the main characters. In fact, the viewer will spend more time delving into the main character's psyche or past than they will do watching action scenes. This is a major issue. Why? Because what the show is ultimately most memorable for, it's presentation-based qualities, is not what the show seems to want its viewer to focus on. I wouldn't go so far as to say the visual qualities were distracting- because in reality the show's plot is remarkably simple. However, by the middle section of the second movie I must admit that I found myself lost to the plot's superficial intricacies. After a certain point, I devolved to the point that I only paid attention to the story's bare-bone elements: X character betrayed Y. Z character killed Y. And so on. The numerous hows and whys no longer mattered in favor of the rainbows of colors (or guts) dancing across my 1080p screen. Whatever happened, happened. Just like it is with Hellsing Ultimate or Afro Samurai, but to a much worse degree due to the many, many directions this show goes in. Yes. That's right. Throughout the course of Mardock Scramble any interested viewers can expect a combination gruesome cyber action, legal trials, speculative-based science fiction, (""the paradise"") to a fast-paced casino heists. None of the directions are bad mind you. But it is a lot to take in, and the rabid pace of Mardock Scramble all but ensures most viewers will stop asking questions and just take in the visual presentation as it comes. In my case I was gone mentally by the middle of the second movie.

Speaking of which, this leads directly into the second biggest criticism: the story. Specifically, the show's lack of an adequate ending. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news folks, but I feel very strongly in making sure this information is out there. Just as quickly as the viewer is drawn into this 186 minute fray; the viewer is just as forcibly spewed out of it. I'm just going to say this as directly as possible. The ending will will not feel sufficient. In my opinion it's almost like the animators were thinking of making a fourth movie but decided last minute not to. A feeling of inadequacy will linger and it doesn't take much thinking to understand why. There are numerous long-term aspirations and plot points presented to our main characters that are just never answered. For example, a major question repeatably presented to Rune Ballot, the primary feline protagonist of our story, is what she would have made of herself had her life not turned out the way it did. The viewer kind of waits around assuming by the end of the movie question will be answered- but it never is. So, fair warning! Softer viewers should be prepared for moderate levels of Post-Anime Depression Syndrom. On paper having PADS doesn't make sense. The fundamental backbone of Mardock Scramble is as a revenge story after all, and a central theme to any revenge story is vindication of its main characters in some way. Nevertheless, most viewers who stick with Mardock Scramble will not feel Rune Ballot is vindicated at all. Her enemies may be defeated and external conflict resolved...But the viewer will still be left feeling empty. Some writers and fans support such a course of action because it promotes viewers to be contemplative and reflective long after its conclusion, or promote discussion. But you know what? I disagree. For a story to spend so much time developing its characters' internal conflicts and backgrounds, and then leave it to the viewers to come up with their own implied resolutions/interpretations...I'm sorry but think that's just lazy storytelling. In strictly ""literary"" terms, this is because Mardock Scramble only has a denouement instead of a resolution. For anyone that doesn't remember that term from their high school English class, (Understandable. I had failed this test twice before I understood the concept.) Go take a piece of paper and draw a straight with an upwards carrot head in the middle. This is commonly shown in books as what's called a plot diagram or ""plot pyramid"". If look at the right side of the chart, at the little bend where the right side of the arrow meets the straight line is called the denouement. (The meeting on the opposite side is the inciting incident.) The straight line going on beyond that bend is what's referred to as the Resolution. In the reading world this is most commonly shown to us via an epilogue or the words ""happily ever after"". Mardock Scramble supplies neither. Thus the dreary, empty feeling once its over.

As to what this means on a practical level, it means that the character's actions and struggles may ultimately feel very inconsequential to many viewers by the end. Not to lose sight of a positive because the fact that Mardock Scramble even has some sort of end-point (whereas many anime are either inconclusive or unending) speaks VOLUMES over countless other anime. But a resolution? No. Mardock Scramble doesn't really have one. A step in the right direction? Surely, but still not quite up to the standard many western viewers would expect of such a high-quality show like this. Once again: the more engaging a story is the more glaring its flaws become. The only reason why I speak so critically is because of how close it is to being on the same level as many of its contemporaries. I can't speak for every anime fan, but nothing is more frustrating to me than an anime than lost potential. Mardock Scramble is so saturated with potential that most people will raise it beyond its normal station. For all its flaws in pacing and writing it is immediately apparent those who created this show poured their hearts into it. Watching the discs many special features verifies that.

Anyways...Let's switch focus to something that Mardock Scramble does right: its presentation.

If you took Mardock Scramble outside the context of its plot, pacing, and resolution than you'd have one of the best products available on the market. Of ANY medium, visually speaking. For this purpose alone Mardock Scramble is worthy of a purchase. Don't get me wrong. The more enthusiastic viewers may not be able to forgive the other issues I mentioned (as well as others) that will unnerve them to no end. But there are other aspects of this show that even the strongest of critics such as myself can not ignore. On a purely superficial level this show works, and works remarkably well. There is a certain color schematic existent in this show that, to my knowledge, doesn't really exist anywhere else except art. Perhaps a handful of video games maybe. (Like FC3: Blood Dragon.) Namely, my experience with this type of imagery exists from blacklight posters or other anime.

Like this: http://www.amazon.com/Wormhole-Blacklight-Poster-Print/dp/B007JYQJFU/ref=sr_1_8?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1434272219&sr=1-8&keywords=Blacklight+posters

Or this: http://www.amazon.com/Opticz-Arctic-Aurora-Blacklight-Reactive/dp/B00T3V3QGC/ref=pd_sim_201_33?ie=UTF8&refRID=02DMXM17HDQTQMMET4YF

But instead of a stationary poster viewers receive a fluid, moving, television series that delivers where it matters most. From an artistic and animation standpoint this is near-ground breaking stuff. Right up there with the likes of Redline, Lupid the Third: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, Mushi Shi, or Mononoke. I can not stop praising it because Mardock Scramble is truly breathtaking. The visuals burned itself into my mind, and continued to demand my focus even after the story faltered. So many emotions were felt just by its visuals. For example, the edginess of its urban environments, or the wonder at beholding the robotic paradise refuge. These are great delights I had when watching Mardock Scramble, delights I wouldn't trade for anything. If someone really wants to get an idea of what it's like: go check out the links I provided and look up HD screenshots of Mardock. Coincidentally, I've been an avid fan of blacklight posters my entire life. I know this type of color schematic as well as anyone. (I have twelve posters hanging up on my wall.) Mark my words though: it is still no substitute. Artistically I have never, ever come across something like Mardock Scramble. While with my posters I would look at them and think they looked pretty neat, to me this entire trilogy has been something akin to walking through a lucid dream. I don't do drugs, and have never taken psychedelic compliments, nor do I promote it. But if I did? I'd imagine that this movie would be a life-altering experience. But even without the drug compliments Mardock Scramble manages to seep into your mind and soul affect you in ways that can only be explained by viewing it. Everyone should witness Mardock Scramble at least once. Even if they aren't particularly fond of anime. The art alone is enough to warrant a purchase or viewing, but when taken along with other parts of the presentation like the exquisite action sequences (Particularly in the first movie) or the numerous set pieces like Paradise or The Casino and you have one of, if not, the best looking Anime out there. It really is a wonderful combination of visual impressionism action choreography that can not be missed.

Despite it all, despite the dozens of other little nitpicks I have; I truly envy you if this is your first experience with Mardock Scramble.

Sincerely,

Blitzkrieger Man",1434240000,25,11841,5.043944813490036

I usually enjoy grain/noise when its not too much, but this has FAR TOO MUCH of it and its so distracting seeing all those rainbow speckles floating and moving all over the place that you cant concentrate on the movie.

This is a new series too, so it shouldn't be this bad.

The video may have more grain in it, but it looks better than the DVD's I have and more details from being in HD resolution.

This does not look like an upscale to me.",1439856000,,493,4.212765957446808

7027153,2,B00U0WY2J8,"Mercy! Where to begin?
I bought this blu-ray trilogy of movies about a month ago to watch during an anime marathon with a buddy of mine. We were both excited. The premise sounded cool. And things got off well indeed! The first disc is very entertaining.
Rune Balot is a 15-year-old prostitute murdered by a psychopath who likes to take the remains (ashes) of the girls he kills and turn them into blue diamonds for rings on his fingers. Not sure how that works, but whatever.
Anyway, Doctor Easter, employed by a company or corporation or rival faction or whatever that opposes the murderer's organization (it's anime, just go with it) intervenes and uses forbidden technology to bring her back to life. Balot gets hooked up with a construct, named Ophcoque (pronounced ""Off Cock"") that normally takes the form of a mouse, but can really be anything like a gun or knife or a super amazing suit that imbues her with speed and agility and basically makes her a killing machine.
So, naturally, she's going to go after her killer and waste him with these incredible new abilities, right?
Wrong! Instead she's trying to find evidence to convict him in some judicial proceeding.
So, there's the basic premise. Disc 1, The First Compression, is pretty good. One thing you will notice right away is that the animation is solid and its got sort of a unique look. Everything is bathed in a pastel, neon glow that makes it very distinctive.
There's some cool stuff happening in the first hour of this trilogy. One character is introduced - you'll know the name when you hear it - that had me laughing for hours. There's all sort of the usual anime craziness going on here. Compelling action. Ends in a cliffhanger. So far so good.
Disc 2, The Second Combustion, is where things just totally unravel. Most of the hour is spent with the main character playing blackjack and roulette in a casino and having deep, utterly ridiculous philosophical conversations.
Disc 3. More blackjack. Half the darn disc (called The Third Exhaust but ""Exhaustion"" would be more accurate) is spent playing more blackjack!
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!
The ending is OK, but the whole affair feels like a wasted opportunity.
There're a few aggravating little things as well.
We watched the dubbed version of the movie. I thought the English voice actors were good. But for a half to two thirds of the movie, the main character's last name was pronounced like ""bellow."" Then, suddenly without any rhyme nor reason, it changes to ""Ballot."" Huh?
Logical inconsistencies abound as well. The way the villain ""hides"" his memories is stupid.
At one point, inexplicably, he's let out on bail. But it happen after he gets convicted. What kind of justice system is this?
All in all, it's just OK. At least it hangs together enough to make sense in its own way. I hate confusing, nonsensical anime that pretentiously plods along leaving you bewildered at what the heck you are even watching. It is a little overwrought and silly at times, but the story can at least be understood. Unfortunately, two thirds of the trilogy is just quite simply boring.
I wanted to like it. But I just can't recommend it.
I didn't watch any of the extra features, so I can make no comment on them.",1437868800,3,3226,4.75222816399287

8703758,4,B00U0WY2J8,"Saw these movies on the Internet a long time ago and forgot about them. But after a friend of mine brought them up again I finally decided to buy them.

 These films are very well-made and easily a very good piece of media for someone who is a fan of the science fiction or cyberpunk area. However they are clearly not for anyone. Especially anyone under the age of 17 . These films cover some very dark subject matter in a few areas. On one hand this is a good thing because it shows I guess one could say the darker side of Anime. But on the other hand one needs to take into consideration what they are getting into.

PROS: good production values, decent length, great music, good visuals, fairly engaging story.

CONS: (more warnings then problems) films cover some very very sensitive subject matter and are not shy on largely showing it on camera. Rape, homicide, underage prostitution, drug abuse, disturbing imagery and a myriad of other things definitely mean these films are not for the faint of heart or squeamish. They are also not films for individuals who can be easily offended . However the majority of these cons are not done so for the sake of shock value but rather most of them are actually coherent to the plots regardless know what you're getting into before purchasing.",1526860800,,1292,4.58008658008658
