3546660,5,B001E6RENK,"Perhaps it is because I lived in Newton Ma during the Russian immigration wave of the 80s,
and because my own family mix is both Puritan (think Bay Colony) and recently immigrated -
Thai from the 70s, Irish from the 90s , that I love this film.  I used it in classrooms in an old VCR version until breakage
and was THRILLED to see it on DVD.  I have used this to teach immigration  religious tolerance, diversity,
family and school traditions etc. with students ages 8 to 12 and all have responded positively to the tale.

Barbara Cohen's popular book, which we also read, is based on her aunt's experiences in the 1920s but the movie
is based on post USSR American suburbs in the 1990s and Barbara Cohen herself has a walk on part as
the traffic guard. I love that it also leads into the topic of religious persecutions - Puritans, Hanukkah, JMJ's flight into Egypt

Beautifully done",1356220800,2,884,4.5
3546661,5,B001E6RENK,TEACHING AN EXCELLENT LESSON IN TOLERANCE FOR ALL PEOPLE THE CHILDREN REALLY NEED TO GIVE CHILDREN A CHANCE EVEN IF THEY APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THEM,1355616000,,153,4.703703703703703
3546662,5,B001E6RENK,"Wonderful film.  I use it at Thanksgiving to teach my students something they may not know about the definition of ""Pilgrim.""  Molly is a Russian Jew whose family came to America for religious freedom.  Molly gets picked on mercilessly, but holds her temper and wins out in the end.  My students love this film!",1353369600,,311,4.703703703703703
3546663,5,B001E6RENK,"""In Russia, it's very hard to be Jewish."" You feel for this girl and the challenges as a child she went through. Sophia Eliazova was excellent as Molly. Great to see other actors from this award winning short film went on to hit television like Robert Clohessy (Gym Teacher) was in Oz, Life On Mars & Third Watch; Albert Makhtsier (Molly's Papa) was in The Sopranos and Sex & The City. Even the original author, Barbara Cohen got a cameo as the School Crossing Guard.
I loved watching this movie on the Disney Channel growing up, and happy to finally have it on DVD! A must watch every Thanksgiving!",1353369600,,599,4.504587155963303
3546664,5,B001E6RENK,"This movie is about a young girl who is sensitive and intelligent beyond her years.  She integrates the lessons taught from the Pilgrims who came to America for religious freedom to her situation - she and her family had come to America seeking a better life from Russia.
The analogy is poignant.  Molly experiences the prejudice and hate her classmates feel toward an immigrant.  The lesson isn't lost on her.  Molly, who would rather not go to school and face the other students, did as her parents requested.  She compared her situation to that of the original Pilgrims who faced open discrimination and hurtful actions.
This is an excellent way to show young people how deeply their actions can affect others.",1262822400,8,713,4.859504132231405

3546666,4,B001E6RENK,Such a great lesson in tolerance and acceptance.,1420070400,,48,5.125
3546667,5,B001E6RENK,I love how close the movie sticks to the book.,1416355200,,46,3.7
3546668,4,B001E6RENK,I will be using this for a little girl & her family who just immigrated from Romania. I can see this being a useful tool in an elementary classroom at Thanksgiving. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the video quality left a little to be desired.,1412035200,,256,4.14
3546669,5,B001E6RENK,"One of my favorite stories to watch every Thanksgiving with my kids. We just stumbled upon it at our Public library one day in the mid 90's.
Love sharing it with my 3rd grade class. It is a story that transcends time and generations. In this is age of mounting racial tensions it is a great story to remind us all that there are many modern day pilgrims...each with their own story.",1408924800,,382,4.319444444444445
3546670,4,B001E6RENK,"Good movie. I use it to with my ELL students and it's a pretty good conversation starter. Of course, there are other extension activities that can be done too.",1388361600,,159,4.517241379310345
3546671,4,B001E6RENK,"Perfect for using in classroom to compare to book, and readers theater play. Led to great discussions about why movies are always soooo different from books. (Kids still liked the movie better. Blah!)",1387584000,,200,5.090909090909091
3546672,5,B001E6RENK,"I purchased this movie because I teach a small unit on Molly's Pilgrim just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday. Together we read the book, worked on different reading strategies and worksheets and concluded the unit by watching the movie and creating our own pilgrims out of clothespins. What is exceptional about the movie is that the students in my class could see how difficult being an immigrant can be. They saw the prejudice shown towards Molly because she was ""different"". They could relate to Molly's feelings and her desire to go back from where she came from. Even though the book was enjoyable to read, seeing the movie made the lessons very clear for my students.",1387584000,,674,4.818965517241379
3546673,5,B001E6RENK,I used this in my third grade class after we read the book. The students really enjoyed it and allowed us to compare and contrast the book and movie.  The Book/movie were part if our unit on tolerance.,1371427200,,201,4.2894736842105265
3546674,5,B001E6RENK,I share this every year with the third graders.  It is wonderful story with a good message.  They are always surprised that Molly as a new immigrant doesn't know the story of the American holiday of Thanksgiving.  Third graders are all about fairness so they take the story to heart and really embrace the message.,1360281600,2,314,4.672727272727273
8296813,4,B001E6RENK,"I show it to my 4th grade resource students after we read the book together and discuss about immigrants seeking freedom and a home in a new land. At first, Molly doesn't find much to be thankful for when her classmates giggle at her Yiddish accent and make fun of her unfamiliarity with American ways. Molly's mother helps with a Thanksgiving project by making a little doll that looks more like a Russian refugee than a New England Pilgrim. The tiny modern-day pilgrim helps Molly find a place for herself in America and helps her classmates be more understanding and compassionate.",1523059200,,584,4.792079207920792
8296814,5,B001E6RENK,"Cute for younger kids. It is not easy growing up Jewish not even in today's world, so this movie helps kids understand not everyone is the same and we can embrace each others differences and still be friends.",1499990400,,208,4.5
8296815,5,B001E6RENK,It's terrific. I had the old VHS tape which had terrible sound and color.  They are both great on the DVD. A great video for thanksgiving as well as teaching acceptance of others to my students. Thanks,1493942400,,201,4.4324324324324325
8296816,5,B001E6RENK,I teach this book to my students so great to have the movie go along with it. Especially excited when I saw the price come down.,1493856000,,128,3.9615384615384617
8296817,5,B001E6RENK,I received this in great condition.,1490313600,,35,5.0
8296818,5,B001E6RENK,Great story; replaced an old VHS copy.,1487721600,,38,4.571428571428571
8296819,5,B001E6RENK,"It's a great video to use with students, especially after they read the book.
The quality of the DVD was super.",1482192000,,111,4.333333333333333
8296820,4,B001E6RENK,"Hopefully your local library will have this for you to view as 30 bucks for a short story movie is way overpriced!!!
Why are all of the best, clean movies always so pricey???? Crazy fallen world...",1478217600,,197,4.5
8296821,3,B001E6RENK,"Great story, but be aware that the book and the movie are VERY different and that the movie is really outdated.  It looks like it might have been made in the 1960's and I was a little disappointed because it really is one of my favorite books to read aloud. The cost is high also.",1448150400,,280,4.090909090909091
8296822,4,B001E6RENK,"Always been a good video for schools.
The only problem is dressing up the American Indians (not done anymore). This DVD/video is so old it should sell  for $10. Not the $30 that I had to pay!!",1445212800,,192,4.1891891891891895
