Other apps are so sterile. I think we all learn through a combination of mental exercise and social interaction - and this is what Bueno, Entonces does. So five stars from me.

3867658,5,B0027IMFD8,"This is really a neat twist on learning spanish. It's a little fast paced but I guess that makes it more real-world than simply learning a bunch of vocabulary words. It many times puts you in over your head with the cross chatter but the basic lesson proceeds nicely. My only complaint is that I got what was clearly a used set of DVDs but was able to pay full price for them :( Oh well, they work so far.",1257379200,3,405,4.075
3867659,5,B0027IMFD8,"Bueno Entonces turns out to be a guilty pleasure in a pool of boring competitors.  Many of the competitors are simply BORING.  Bueno Entonces, on the other-hand, uses instructors you could hang-out with and converse about anything...including those subjects thought totally taboo by mom and dad.  This course runs fast, and you may need to listen to or view the lessons more than once, but the payback will likely be that you'll be well on your way to fluency.",1256688000,3,460,4.7974683544303796
3867660,5,B0027IMFD8,"I'm a beginning student of Spanish, middle-age enough to appreciate learning and study time, and I've seen numerous presentations of learning materials over the years.  This video set definitely keeps your interest and that's half the battle when learning a new language.  It's fun, it's edgy, not for moral conservatives unless you have a good sense of humor!  Definitely not for kids under 16, I'd say.  David is a guy in his 20s who's gone to Argentina to learn Spanish; his good fortune finds him instructed by a very lovely native chica.  Let the flirting and fun begin!  There's a professor comic character who pops up now and then with grammar lessons.  David and his sexy professor are shown in body sketch form with ""real"" human pictures of their faces that change to reveal expressions matching the ongoing dialogue between them.  Both of these voice-only actors are excellent!  Lots of interest and excitement in their voices and great enunciation.  I love it!  My only problem is that it goes too fast for me as a beginner.  The content is beginner level, starting with basic greetings and introductions, but everything sequences too quickly because I'm trying to hear and listen as well as read the dialogue that's displayed on the screen. And get this... I'm supposed to comprehend the color coding of the displayed the words too!  It's just not possible, at least not right now in my learning.  They speak at relatively normal pace, well, probably even a bit slow, but not slow enough for a beginner.  But I'm going to keep trying because I think there's a lot of benefit to be had here.  It's very well done.  I wish there was printed material to go with it -- alas, none of that.  I guess they saved trees, but if the set included something printed, I could study the material at a slower pace, then watch the video and probably grasp a lot more of it.  Seems like I should at least get the printed transcript for the high price.  One buyer note:  It comes as 6 DVDs in 3 cases.  That's it!  No box as shown in the Amazon picture.  No printed materials to follow along.  I googled the product name and found a website for it,but there's no dialogue transcript or supporting learning materials to be found.  Too bad, that would make it the ultimate product.  Worth your money after you've had 3-6 months of Spanish -- If you're there, buy it now, otherwise add it to your cart and purchase it later!  Hope this is helpful.  P.S. I think you can purchase and download individual chapters from their website and you can also try a demo there.  Enjoy!",1246060800,21,2564,4.6084070796460175
3867661,1,B0027IMFD8,"Originally, I gave this product a 5 star.  It is still a 5 star.  BUT .....  How in the heck did they get 9 (NINE) glowing 5 star reviews on November 18, 2009???  And the next 8 reviews until Dec 8, were from reviewers with only ONE review.  What's the chance of that?  Except that 17 of the 20 ratings until December 8, 2009 were phoney?  How did they get that perrrfect 5 star rating that quickly?  Except by self glorification.  One of the rater actually admitted that she is the MOTHER of one of the developer of Bueno Entonces.  So, I knocked my rating down to 2 stars, just to draw attention to a company's attempt to play with numbers.... Shame on you !!!!  You would have retained the 5 star rating, but you rushed it.  By the way, if you remove your phoney ratings, I'll give you back your 5 stars.

I like their color coding to outline sentence structure, masculinity of nouns, position of indirect and direct objects.  The themes are adult in nature, an the program would be inappropriate for minors.  Which is sad, as they have a good program.  The program is entertaining.  Eventhough the entire program will take about 18 hours, you will likely go through it several times - thus the lessons are not simply done in 18 hours.

There is significant use of vos and os, with its unusual form of conjugation which is not taught in many classes.  For me it is a plus, but for some, it might be confusing and frustrating.  As it is different than the vosotros that we are familiar with.  The vos form is conjugated different in different countries.

You can still download the program for less than half price of the DVD's.  Search for it on the internet, and it will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour to download the entire 30 lessons.",1244937600,38,1741,4.38871473354232
3867662,2,B0027IMFD8,"Very entertaining program to watch.  I did the whole thirty classes before I went to Buenos Aires in October of 2010.  I then took language classes while there.

It is nice to listen to Jimena speak with a BA accent but you will not learn to speak from this course.  It is completely passive.

David, the other actor, speaks a considerable amount of English.  It can get quite frustrating when you wish to hear Spanish.

The story line is entertaining but that is about it.

If you want to SPEAK the language, I would suggest The Pimsleur Method.  It is much less entertaining but it does force you to speak which is something you need to do to communicate.

One other thing...at first I liked the English and Spanish subtitles but I then I realized that I was relying on the English.  This gave me a false sense of learning.  If only you could turn off the English subtitles!",1301011200,13,876,4.440251572327044
3867663,5,B0027IMFD8,"In High School, I learned little Spanish, probably because I was seated next to my husband-to-be?  Then, because I did not want to take Spanish in college, I studied very hard so that I could pass the placement test, and not have to take ANY more Spanish.  I did manage to place in Spanish 4, but got my first and only ""D.""

 THEN I discovered Mexico!  I finally wanted to speak Spanish, so I took private lessons from a well-known school.  Guess what?  I still did not do well.  My teacher pronounced me ""too analytic.""  I suspect she was correct.

But years later, I retired to Mexico.  ""Surely"", I thought, ""living here will do it for me.""  Well, I certainly have improved, but not as much as I'd have liked.  (I finally read that John Updike himself had similar  problems with French--and I felt a bit better.)

Recently, I downloaded ""Bueno Entonces.""  It is a WOW program indeed!  I don't know  yet if I'll learn any better from this program, but I sure enjoy the effort a lot more.

Many Argentinians are of Italian ancestry, so its not uncommon to have a family that branched out to the US as well as Argentina 100+ yrs ago.  When first learning Spanish, there is no such thing as ""standard Spanish"" so learning one variant well is an asset---it's much easier to learn differences once you know an ""intact"" language.
This video series is great fun and very well organized once you start to become aware of the magic underneath the ""spontaneous"" conversations.  I would give it five stars if there were more/better support materials included.",1286841600,,613,4.990196078431373

Not like Spanishpod101 and other online programs that require as much effort to figure you how to use the program as the effort required to learn the language.

Having said all that, the Spanish here is a dialect that is really used in small percentage of the Spanish speaking world.  That hasn't stopped me from using it because it is so fun.  Nevertheless, if they came up with a more general Latin American Spanish version, I'd use it.  Also, I wish there were quizzes or something by which to measure progress.

  I have tried other methods, and they are either as boring as High School Spanish, or too basic like Dora the Explorer. I think most people will enjoy being educated like an adult for once. I enjoy being able to learn new things each time I repeat a module.

They use color coding and symbols to help you differentiate between the different parts of speech and whatnot (which is the aspect that most other methods focus on), so you are still learning the grammatical part, but at the same time it is a dialogue that you are watching and listening to, so you get the idea of what it's like to have a conversation.  And conversation is the main reason people learn a language, after all, right?  I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone who a) finds normal methods to be boring as hell, and/or b) wants to learn how to speak and understand a language rather than just focusing on the written aspect.

and are not truly forced to understand what we're learning. With
audio, we're left to wonder how things are written, and with written
exercises we're often wondering how you might pronounce the words. The
great thing about Bueno, entonces... is that we're given the
opportunity to incorporate more than one learning style. Read, speak,
AND write as we learn. As all good teachers know, the more senses you
can incorporate into a lesson the better you'll learn.

The ""Magic White Board"" (Pizarra Mgica) displays the words as the
action takes place. Beginning students will learn from the lessons and
more advanced students will find a lot of value in listening to the
conversations that occur between ""lessons"". Jimena and David have
great chemistry and make the lessons fun. I'd recommend letting the
words and lessons flow over you a few times before you worry too much
about understanding every word and grammatical nuance. Use these as
another element in your learning toolbox and you'll find high value in

thought I had a basic understanding of the grammar, pronunciation, and
a general handle on the language when I moved to Buenos Aires, but I
found that cracking in to the 'localisms' that are present in
Castellano were altogether different until a friend recommended that I
check out a 'home-grown' solution to learning the basics of Castellano
while living in Buenos Aires. After whipping thru the first 5 lessons,
I realized that I was far better off in acclimating my ear to the
idiomatic expressions used here, and the form of speech that Porteos
use in everday communication. I have been using ""Bueno, entonces"" as
my on-the-fly language professor and couldn't be happier. I would
certainly suggest to anyone interested in learning Spanish to try
this, as it's really easy, has a presentation format that is unlike

8354783,3,B0027IMFD8,"Pros:

1. Good listening practice - the on screen transcript is a great idea and works very well. If you have a problem with the speed you can slow things down by watch the video on VLC media player (free) and pressing ""["" and ""]"" to slow down and speed up.
2. Is somewhat fun and has a nice pace for the most part. Especially week 3.
4. A lot of the jokes David makes when he learns something new in Spanish work as mnemonics.
5. Colour system and on screen subtitles in both languages is a great idea.
6. Don't worry about being a beginner, I would say the lower your level the more this course will help you, it doesn't matter if you don't understand every word.

Cons:

1. Does not get you to the level of Spanish promised
2. Does not include enough extra activities
3. Is too passive and does not provide you with opportunities to practice. These are videos for you to watch.
4. Far too  much English spoken and long periods of off topic ramblings which teach you nothing and aren't particularly amusing.
5. Starts to drag terribly from week 4 especially, even the two actors start to seem a bit bored, and David just doesn't feel like speaking Spanish a lot of the time. There's a lot more English and listening, it gets a lot more frustrating.

Pros in detail:

1. The best thing about this course is the speed, native speakers speak much faster than this but most courses for beginners speak much much slower. Slow Spanish is not a real language and nobody speaks it. This course had me far ahead of my friends who started at the same time or even long long before me in terms of listening, maybe I only knew 3 words in the sentence while they knew all of them, but I was actually able to hear and recognize those three words that I knew and so follow the conversation better.

Cons in detail:

1. It says on the website:  ""Bueno, entonces... covers all the requirements set out by the Common European Framework Reference for Languages for Spanish 1A and 1B""

This is absolutely not true by any stretch of the imagination. Just because the teacher speaks Spanish fluently doesn't mean the courses teaches all the requirements.  For one thing, to reach a B1 level you need to know and use all the past tenses very well and have a basic grasp of the subjunctive. You generally need to have an active vocabulary of 2000-4000 words and a passive understanding of all of the tenses while being able to actively use most of them.
There are no past tenses taught in Bueno Entonces and no active activities that get you to practice speaking or writing whatsoever. You also won't have a B1 level of listening, believe me. (To be fair, level 1-5 of the Rosetta Stone will also not not get you to a B1 level if used on their own, but they'll cost you 500. However, I don't think Rosetta Stone claims to get you to this level). It was a year after I had finished Bueno Entonces that I finally did my B1 exam and passed it, it would never have been possible if I had just used that one resource, even if I had watched every episode 100 times (I watched each one 2-3 times originally, depending, and I've watched most of them again since.)

2. There is not enough extra material with it, there is no key with the few exercises that are sent and the extra activities available on the website are not organized enough (and they were not even available at the time I bought it). (If this situation has changed then please say so by commenting on this post.)
There are however many flashcard sites and other websites for learning Spanish available free on the internet, and Bueno Entonces could be a good supplement to them.

4. The biggest problem with this course is the amount of English David speaks. He goes on and on and on with these uninteresting stories that teach you nothing. It is clear right from the start that he is not a beginner, so why pretend? Why not have him speak to Jimena in Spanish?

David seems to get annoyed at the whole ""lets learn Spanish"" premise and start ranting, which must have been written into the script and I can't understand why.

Extra info:

I would like to have been told that vos (Argentina informal ""you"") and vosotros (Spanish informal ""all of you"") have pretty much the same conjugations except that vosotros includes an extra I.. A lot of people complain that they are both useless in most of the world, but you learn one you get the other free, so it's worthwhile.

Price:

Next time I would save my money for when I hit intermediate/advanced level, as there are far fewer free resources at this point, now is the time I should be buying things but
I am not sorry I bought it, I did enjoy it and David and Jimena felt like friends, one of them happens to be annoying but hey, he's a friend. (I guess he wouldn't be my friend for long after I called him annoying on the Internet)

If you do decide to buy from the website wait until they have a sale on, if you follow them on twitter you'll see when. Also there is higher tax on the website if you say you are in the European Union when you buy it, so if you're from the EU then maybe you should wait till you go on holidays!

Conclusion:

Is the course worthwhile?

It depends.

It depends on what you want and on how much you have to spend.
This course will help you to understand Spanish better, if you want to speak it better try ""Learning Spanish like Crazy"" which is about the same price and is a set of CDs filled with drills. It's very boring but it will get you speaking more. If you have trouble motivating yourself or finding studying Spanish interesting, or if you're really just a casual learner, then Bueno Entonces is a better choice for you. It's mostly fun and there's a nice fast pace.

It would also be a good idea for teenagers studying Spanish in school who have a mountain of other subjects to study and have no energy to pour into books. (So long as they understand they will have to use ""tu"" in exams and not ""vos"", and so long as their parents understand that the content is a little grown up at times and there are some curse words).

8354784,3,B0027IMFD8,"I really do enjoy this program, it's fun and I think it's great for learning more about the vos form, Argentinian pronunciation, idioms and culture. But as another reviewer pointed out, it is subtitled in English which can give a false impression of comprehension and it is completely passive. You do not get to speak at all. In my opinion you don't learn to speak and pronounce things correctly unless you do it and listen to yourself so you can adjust your mistakes. They also speak really quickly especially in the grammar and vocabulary sections making it difficult to catch what they are saying and therefore difficult to assimilate the information.
I think this is great for someone traveling to Argentina, but in conjunction with a more active learning program. I am using Pimsleur.",1318291200,2,789,4.895522388059701
8354785,5,B0027IMFD8,"I'm using Bueno Entonces in conjunction with Fluenz Spanish and busuu.com (for more interactive opportunities to record myself and practice with native speakers). However, BE is my favorite and the most fun.  It's refreshing to hear Buenos Aires Spanish lessons spoken casually, conversationally and flirtatiously.  Responsible segues into more formal Spanish are not overlooked, along with clear explanations on formal idioms as required -- thoughtful inclusions for the beginning speaker like myself.  The Pizarra Magica unravels grammatical cats' cradles briefly and humorously, cranking out its material at a cracking pace.  As another reviewer noted, it would be useful to be able to turn off the English subtitles.

Saying that, you won't get bored and will likely even remember some irregular verbs the following day.  I repeat lessons due to the speed of the dialog which is useful because, well, that's how native speakers speak.  The repartee and awkward sexual tension between Jimena and David are a cute twist and keep me interested and coming back for more.  I for one would welcome Spanish 3/4/5 in the cabina acoustica.

If however David & Jimena are over it, General Linguistics could do well to find new crews in Paris, Shanghai or Prague.",1315526400,,1256,5.24
8354786,5,B0027IMFD8,"What a delightful program! David knows nothing initially, and Jimena is teaching him. Jimena starts speaking Spanish. David complains about that early on that she never speaks in English. She informs him that, first of all she is the teacher. And second, this is Spanish class, so she won't be speaking to him in English. And she keeps her promise to the end!

You can always understand whatever she says because it is written out for you on the ""Magic Whiteboard."" Does she speak to quickly for us gringos to understand? Of course she does, sometimes. That's how we learn...being stretched beyond our limits a bit. Don't worry... listen, watch, and follow along as best you can. As you grow in Spanish it will become more and more clear to you.

This is definitely a listening program rather than a speaking program. But most people develop first the ability to read a language, then the ability to speak it, and finally the ability to understand it when spoken. So there are a good many of us out there that need to work on our listening skills.

I love the Pimsleur method, and I love Learning Spanish Like Crazy. Both of those require you to speak it. But sometimes you can't do that...for instance if you are in bed with your spouse or on a trip with someone or on a bus or at work or any number of other places where you have to keep your mouth shut.

And another thing- because of the nature of this program being what it is and not requiring you to speak it back, this program covers far more ground in 30 minutes than Pimsleur or LSLC. The program covers a LOT of vocabulary, far more than those.

And... this program actually goes over grammar rules, something those others do precious little of.

""Doing the whole thirty classes"" one time isn't going to get it done for anyone. This is a series that you're going to have to listen to most every day for 6 months or a year. (Just like Pimsleur and LSLC). It takes time to learn a language, and the fact that this is very entertaining will make the investment of your time fun.

I was initially worried about it being Argentine Spanish, as I always thought it was so strange sounding with a couple of strange rules. But this program has helped me overcome my (irrational) fear of Argentine Spanish. And after all, Argentina is one of the largest and most important Spanish speaking countries in the world, and one that produces a lot of entertainment. And the fact is, since you are only listening and not speaking it with this program, I have found that this doesn't really affect my accent very much. It mostly has just helped me understand Argentine Spanish (and all other Spanish) better. (Note: Any time in this series that something uniquely Argentine comes up, you get a little flag pop up so you know.)

So definitely, I'm very enthused about what they have done here, and am looking forward to Bueno Entonces Nivel Dos!",1314316800,7,2887,4.538461538461538
8354787,2,B0027IMFD8,"I bought this program and am using it daily. I am a low intermediate to intermediate Spanish speaker, can speak and understand enough to get by in Spanish speaking countries - but far from fluent. I have used Rosetta Stone and Fluenz (I highly recommend Fluenz - it put me heads above my fellow adult Spanish students in a short time, is intelligently structured and fun to use - buy it before buying this). That said, I was very happy to find Bueno Entonces, because I want to retire someday in Uruguay or Argentina, where the Rioplatense dialect taught in this program is spoken. If you are a beginner, I would not recommend this program as a starting point, unless Buenos Aires or Montevideo is your destination - the use of this unique dialect will only confuse you (Vos form and its verb conjugations are almost never used outside of these areas). Personally, overall, I highly value this program - it is the only thing around that teaches Porteo Spanish, which is my main interest right now. I cannot see a beginner learning Spanish easily from this program, however - it moves too quickly, starts at a fairly high level and has no interaction whatsoever. But my main gripe, and I am very surprised I don't see this mentioned more here - is the annoying character of David. He is the most ridiculously chauvinistic sleazeball you will ever encounter outside of a big city construction site. A more sexually immature individual would be hard to imagine. His non-stop, single-minded sleaziness gets old quickly - he is hitting on the teacher throughout the entire program. And while his teacher does a great job of showing him up, I find his character unbearably lame. His cocky attitude provides nothing useful to someone wanting to interact with people in Latin America, where politeness is cherished. I am no prude, by the way - Y tu Mama Tambien is one of my favorite films, for instance. David is almost like an English version of one of the boys from that flick - an immature, self-centered jerk. As a man, I see David as the kind of guy who gives guys a bad name, the sort of dude that ladies roll their eyes or throw their drinks at. I will put up with his inane drivel to get what I need from this program, only because I love Argentine Spanish. Jimena, the female lead, is delightful, the kind of teacher I would love to find - perfectly fluent in English and Spanish and blessed with a bright spirit. She is a real person - unlike her annoying mama's boy British counterpart. For her, 5 stars. I just can't fully express how loathsome David's character is - and judging from the harsh response that Patrick Jackson of Learn Spanish like Crazy (who sold this program to his customer base) received, I am not alone. Does this weird format - a teacher constantly fending off the advances and leering, childish innuendos of her male student add anything to the Spanish learning experience? Doubtful. Okay, they do describe David as a ""Jackass"" in the intro to the program - truth in advertising! If you like low vibration, self-absorbed numbskulls; enjoy bad sit-coms; or like me, have a serious interest in learning the Rioplatense dialect, Bueno Entonces might be just the ticket. But if you want a solid grounding in Spanish, useful in real life situations throughout Latin America and Spain, taught in a truly entertaining way - get Fluenz Spanish, it may be a little more expensive, but it blows Bueno Entonces away. I am in no way affiliated with Fluenz, I just own almost every Spanish learning resource out there, and find Fluenz superior to anything I have found for easily getting a head start in speaking, reading and understanding Spanish up to an intermediate level. It is hip without being smarmy - something ""David"" could learn a great deal about.",1312934400,4,3773,4.683734939759036
8354788,4,B0027IMFD8,"The program is easy to use. I am very weak at learning language. I almost failed Spanish and french in high school.  So I am impressed that this program is engaging and I gain some very modest competency if I use it on a regular basis.
The program has a major weakness which is there is no opportunity for the user to pronounce and therefore an important component of learning is absent.  Also occasionally the humorous quipping becomes annoying.",1309737600,2,446,4.632911392405063
