2752232,4,B000MYXOSE,"after looking for good instruction in Tai Chi, we stumbled across David-Dorian Ross' DVDs, of which we own several now. Although video instruction is helpful, we are still seeking in-person coaching in this beautiful art.",1328745600,3,221,5.3428571428571425
2752233,5,B000MYXOSE,"David Dorian Ross is very detailed in his Tai Chi instruction.  You will learn the finer details of the short form movements.  This DVD has a section that highlights each movement plus practice sections.  You will also learn how to focus on improving your movements by focusing on Tai Chi principals.  All in all, this DVD will give you a good foundation for the Tai Chi short form.",1327363200,7,382,4.573529411764706
2752234,5,B000MYXOSE,"THE BEST I SEEN IN A EASY TO FOLLOW SHORT YANG STYLE TAI CHI FORM,BUT ONLY THE FIRST 24 POSITIONS. I RECCOMEND THIS FOR ANY BEGINNER BUT DO NOT TRY TO SAVE A COUPLE DOLLARS AND BUY USED, I DID AND THE ""AS NEW"" FROM DEALER WAS A BIT  FUZZY. I HAVE SINCE REPURCHASED DISC NEW!",1312934400,3,274,3.892857142857143
2752235,3,B000MYXOSE,"David is a fine instructor but this DVD is difficult to follow. You are instructed to move the same direction David moves, while facing him; your movements are not mirrored. So, unless you are watching a segment with the performers' backs to you, you are struggling with direction as well as new movements.",1283731200,9,306,4.7924528301886795
2752236,5,B000MYXOSE,"I love the Tai Chi program with David Dorian-Ross.  His instructions are very clear and easy to follow; he's also good to look at, which makes the exercise more appealing.  Seriously, he makes Tai Chi a very comfortable exercise to do, which is one way to keep a person motivated!",1275004800,8,280,4.58
2752237,5,B000MYXOSE,"This is for anyone who sincerely wants to learn T'ai Chi Yang style Short Form. Excellent instructor and demonstrators teach step-by step poses. Hand movements and leg movements are taught separately making it easier to understand, and the atmosphere is a relaxed one on the Hawaiian beach. The photography is excellent. One who practices with this program every day can probably learn the whole Short Form in less than two weeks.

There is a flow motion workout and a section all movements are put together in sequence. These lessons can be the foundation for those who want to go on to the next levels of T'ai Chi.

A great program for health and wellness, great instructors who should be applauded and thanked.",1265673600,20,713,4.836065573770492
2752238,5,B000MYXOSE,The Tai Chi lessons on this DVD are much easier to follow than others I have used. Doing the arms and legs separately and then putting them together helped a lot.  The only change I would make is in the formatting of the DVD.  It needs to be divided up more so you can do just a few moves at a time.,1237680000,18,299,3.806451612903226
2752239,5,B000MYXOSE,"For anyone who wants a really good introduction to Yang Short Form (24 movement) T'ai Chi, this DVD is a nice place to start.  David-Dorian Ross is a well-qualified instructor (World Silver Medalist), and he uses a group of students to illustrate each movement, first the foot position, then the hand position, then both together.  At the end there is a practice session of the entire form that lets you follow along.  There is nothing too technical and the atmosphere is casual, filmed on a beach in Hawaii.  After learning beginning practice here, for more in-depth study (breathing, hand positions, etc) I would recommend YMAA products which are simply the best.",1223769600,40,665,4.963963963963964
2752240,4,B000MYXOSE,"Nice 80s charme, good explanations of the 24form - i have learned it now. Negative is the copy protection.",1443484800,,106,4.631578947368421
2752241,4,B000MYXOSE,Loved this!,1414281600,,11,5.0
2752242,5,B000MYXOSE,A must have for all humans. Should replace contact sports in school,1414108800,3,67,4.666666666666667
2752243,5,B000MYXOSE,This is an excellent learning DVD for the 24-Part Form.  It explains all moves in detail and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.,1396396800,3,138,4.52
2752244,5,B000MYXOSE,I was a very frustrated student of Tai Chi prior to purchasing this video. Thanks to David Dorian Ross's step by step instruction. This video enabled me to learn the basic movements of Yang style Tai Chi forms. Practicing Tai Chi has become one of my important daily routines.,1395792000,8,276,4.653061224489796
2752245,5,B000MYXOSE,"This is the only T'ai Chi video that I found leaves me *completely* proficient in the form. David breaks down each movement by running through it 4 times. First, for many of the moves, he explains the principles behind the specific move. Then, you get a preview of the movement at normal time. Then he talks you through the movement as he demonstrates at a slower pace. Then you get the opposite angle view, again slow. Then he strings it together with several of the moves immediatly preceding it, in normal time. Also, at the beginning and end of the DVD, you get the entire Short Form strung together in normal time.

NONE of the other videos, the 4 I have personally viewed (including the YMAA one a prior Reviewer recommended below), nor the ones I've read on Amazon, offer this full combination -- the front and back slow-time views, the VERBAL (not captioned) explanation (in ENGLISH), and the stringing together of all the forms. Whether this video or another, I cannot over-emphasize the value of this combination.",1388275200,13,1023,4.747191011235955
2752246,5,B000MYXOSE,All 24 moves explained one by one. Ross has always had a fresh sense of humor as well. Great scenery by the beach. For anyone looking into any kind of meditation or qi gong I recommend this as a staple,1375833600,3,201,4.05
2752247,2,B000MYXOSE,"While I do really appreciate David-Dorian Ross's expertise in  teaching, this video is completely confusing and impossible to follow.  Learning the basic moves would be fun except for the fact that the instructor does not provide a mirror image so it is very difficult to follow along and you find yourself with your back to the video looking over your shoulder.  I was really looking forward to getting this instructional video and now feel it was a waste of money and am very dissapointed.",1367193600,4,491,4.821428571428571
2752248,3,B000MYXOSE,"DVD had some areas of picture distortion. Similar to if it was scratched.
Wish it played better than it does.",1361577600,,109,4.5
2752249,5,B000MYXOSE,This is a good intro for beginners. He is slow and explains things well. I think it is a great workout!,1353628800,6,103,3.9523809523809526

8173578,5,B000MYXOSE,I think this is the best instructional Tai chi video available! Ross is a great and thorough teacher,1483747200,,100,4.611111111111111
8173579,4,B000MYXOSE,Enjoying it,1478908800,,11,5.0
8173580,2,B000MYXOSE,Good explanation of wrong discipline.  Good music.,1463097600,,50,6.142857142857143
8173581,5,B000MYXOSE,This is an excellent way to learn basic tai chi moves.  I especially appreciate the fact that one section teaches the moves while another allows the player to move through all the moves in sequence.  The background scenery is soothing and delightful as well. The instructor is world class!,1457222400,,289,4.877551020408164
8173582,5,B000MYXOSE,Very clearly and professionally presented. Impressed with attention to detail and creative ways used to teach the movements from a variety of visual and aural perspectives.,1456790400,,172,5.653846153846154
8173583,5,B000MYXOSE,It is easy to follow.  It came in a timely manner.,1455494400,,50,3.5454545454545454
8173584,5,B000MYXOSE,"I have had a hard time staying with tai chi.  I am doing this dvd again. The presentation is beautiful, it is like a lovely dance. The beauty of it keeps me interested in contiuing. It would be a bit better if the exercise would be done from the back as well.",1447372800,,259,3.980769230769231
8173585,5,B000MYXOSE,"Superb! If you're just starting out, or have a year or two of Tai Chi under your belt--it doesn't matter! An excellent way to learn this lovely art form--ok, yeah it's a Martial Art, but it's also art form.
There's not much that compares to the state of flow you melt into with David Dorian Ross. He breaks it down into easily digestible chunks of physical and mental energy that you, yes you, can nibble or devour.
Get it, do it, then join us for the Daily Flow Show.",1443830400,3,468,4.269662921348314
