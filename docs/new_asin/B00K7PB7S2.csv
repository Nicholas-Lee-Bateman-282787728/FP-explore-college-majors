8656647,1,B00K7PB7S2,"Very poorly written. Poorly directed. Obviously, the care that was given to every episode of The Virginian was not given to The Men From Shiloh. The emotion is gone from all of the actors. Watching everyone walk through story lines is very sad. Even Glen Larson, who went on to bigger and better things after this, failed.",1502064000,,322,4.666666666666667

8656649,3,B00K7PB7S2,"The final season was a sad end for a great TV series. NBC had fallen in love with the ""Name Of The Game"" format of four stars appearing in separate episodes and decided to update ""The Virginian"" to the same format along with a different look that included new clothes and more hair. The worst decision was ditching the great theme of the show for something out of the Eastwood Italian style films.

NBC would have done the fans of the show if they had either cancelled the show after season eight or simply continued the original format for a final year at Shiloh. Season eight had actually made a ratings rebound under the reins of the Frank Price, who was the first executive producer of the show. Price left the series twice and each time the result was bad decisions that hurt the show. Price noted in a book about the series that Lee J. Cobb would have probably stayed with the show, if he had been around during season four. Cobb's leaving, in the middle of season four resulted in a series of ranch owners that did not settle down until season six.

The final season barely visited Shiloh and it felt lost because the interaction of series regulars at the ranch and the best episodes of the season featured James Drury. Neither of the new regulars, Majors and Granger, provided new sparks to make the season stand out. Granger was playing a 40-50 year old character when he was over 60 years which made it impossible to believe 30 year old women would find him a suitable romantic target and taking on much younger men in fights that a man his age could never win.

The only good point from this season is seeing The Virginian and Trampas for one last time.

I own a copy of the 2011 release but found it interested that ""Sheriff Ryder"" agreed to an interview for the DVD while he ignored numerous requests from Paul Green, the writer of the book about the series. Green's book is a must read for a fan of The Virginian.",1476057600,8,1927,4.419718309859155

8656651,4,B00K7PB7S2,I am happy that I was able to get all the DVD's of The Virginian on DVD. Thank you,1470441600,,82,3.3684210526315788
8656652,3,B00K7PB7S2,"The Video & Audio Is Very ""Sub-Par"".  You Have To Either Wear Ear Phones or Sit With Your Remote In Hand To Turn Volume Up & Down. Seems The Producer Relied On Top Name Stars In Each Episode To Give It Some Kick. I only Gave It 3 Stars, Out Of Respect For "" Trampas & The Virginian"".  Being A Die Hard Fan Of What I Believe To Be The 2nd Best ""To Gunsmoke"" Western TV Series, I Find It Hard To Recomend It To Anyone. Maybe If It Had Been Produced With Some Amount Of A Better Video & Audio Quality It Would Have Been Better... In My Opinion  Some Of The Episodes Are Only Bad to Fair.  To Me; Lee Majors & Stewart Granger Did Little To Help Make The 24 Episode Series Any Better. I Can't Understand Why It Lived To Survive 24 Episodes.  JMHO  Thanks. I would like to add though, That the episode of Mr. Granger & Ricardo Montelban In ""The Last Of The Commancheros"" Was 1 Of the Best Of The Series.",1434326400,9,897,4.01123595505618

8656654,3,B00K7PB7S2,"While it certainly is a bonus to have additional interviews on this 2014 reissue of the 2011 box set, having remastered-from-35 mm camera negative-prints copied to DVD, like the first 8 seasons of The Virginian, would have been the real deal. Instead Timeless has added one disc to the same inferior release from 3 years ago (the only thing missing is the claim of remastering, which erroneously labeled the original). All but one episode was taken from bleached out, edited, 16mm syndication prints. Only episode 22, Town Killer, is from a 35mm source. As long as bonuses were being added, where is the 1958 black and white 30 minute pilot episode, featuring James Drury and Jeanette Nolan?",1400025600,22,691,4.914529914529915
