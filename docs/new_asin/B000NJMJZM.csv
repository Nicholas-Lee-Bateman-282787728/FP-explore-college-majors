8178538,3,B000NJMJZM,Even after I watched it last night I can't remember what it was about the next day. It's not a rememberer movie at all. Stay with the Hollywood block buster movies in this subject because they're more interesting to watch.,1422748800,,222,4.575

8178540,3,B000NJMJZM,"OK sword-and-sandal 60s film.  The story is a group of Romans in Gaul territory have to reach their people to report on a secret weapon.  The DVD release is not from VCI Entertainment.  The back of the cover says something else entirely.  Though the quality of the DVD is not great, the picture is not sharp and clear and the sound is low, the color is OK and it is the best I've seen yet of this film.  I would like to see a re-mastered version released soon.  Otherwise an OK DVD release.",1390176000,,490,4.21505376344086
8178541,3,B000NJMJZM,"The basic plot of this movie is established in the opening scenes.  Julius Caesar is running around Gaul (most of which eventually became part of France) conquering the Gauls.  This movie provides some background regarding the political climate back in Rome, showing that support for Caesar was not universal.  However, other than being reasonably accurate historical background, that information is not that relevant to this movie.  What is relevant is that the year is 52 B.C. and Caesar recently suffered a defeat at Gergovia in Gaul.  After various maneuvers, Vercingetorix, leader of the Gauls, moves his army from Gergovia to Alesia.  Historically, Caesar followed the Gauls and laid siege to Alesia, eventually conquering the city and all of Gaul.  According to this movie, it was not that easy.  Supposedly, the Druids, who were helping the Gauls, had a secret weapon in a mountain pass between Gergovia and Alesia, and unless this secret weapon was destroyed, Caesar would not be able to move to Alesia.

Caesar obviously has many options to get to Alesia that do not involve the pass guarded by the secret weapon.  Perhaps that route was the best one because of the rural nature of these areas and lack of roads elsewhere.  Regardless, in this movie Caesar gambles his entire campaign on four volunteers finding the secret weapon and disabling it.  In other words, the historical background is a loose excuse for a quest by a small number of men, and eventually a woman.

The rest of this movie is a series of escapades that bears some similarity to other movies in this general genre.  Our heroes are captured and they escape.  Our heroes face terrible adversity as they outwit the horrible and evil Gauls and Druids.  At one point, our heroes even appear to be ready to give up since they seem unable to figure out how to destroy the secret weapon.  Of course, if our heroes had failed, it is unlikely there would have been a movie.

From a historical perspective, this movie has problems.  Druids generally did not participate directly in these wars, at least not directly.  The fighting was done by the Gauls under Vercingetorix.  Neither did Caesar seem to have much difficulty in moving from Gergovia to Alesia during the historical battles.  So, this movie falls under the category of historical fiction and being inspired by historical events rather than being historically accurate.

This movie does have a lot of variety.  The movie includes romance, bravery, plots, double-crosses, fighting, strategy, cowardice, and much more.  This movie has all the makings of a potentially great movie.  Except, this movie is not great and periodically it is silly.

Part of the problem lies with the overuse of clich&eacute;.  One of our heroes is out to save the rest when he is captured.  He is tortured horribly and crucified, ultimately dying for the sake of the mission.  If the acting was better, these scenes might have been good.  Unfortunately, the torture victim is mostly clean with little (if any) apparent damage to his body.  Passing on his medallion to his mother should have been touching, but the dubbing is so awful that he could have been reading a grocery list.

In another scene, an enemy is captured.  The Romans try to force the enemy to lead them to the Druid stronghold.  The enemy finally says, ""All right, I'll lead you there.  But I warn you, I'm leading you to certain death.""  What is funny, corny actually, is the way he says it in his dubbed voice, in conjunction with the fact that the volunteers knew they were certain to die from the moment they accepted the mission.

In one of the final scenes, several of our heroes have been wandering around in the woods when they come upon a cave.  The leader says something like, ""Look, there is a cave.  That must be where the secret weapon is.""  Of course, the similarities to Monty Python were evident well before this line, but this one event really caps things.  I wonder what would have happened had the secret weapon not been in the cave?  Where are the people from ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""?

One scene at the end of this movie is out of sequence.  One moment we see a hero on the machine.  Next, we see the secret weapon destroyed and Caesar says something about the destroyed object being the secret weapon.  Right after that, our hero is back at the secret weapon in a serious fight for his life.  I was confused at first, but finally realized one scene was out of sequence.

The picture is hardly the greatest and the film needs restored.  Surprisingly, the sound was reasonably good, though re-mastering the soundtrack would be beneficial.  Unfortunately, this movie is in the public domain, and such movies appear to lack sufficient incentive to re-master without the presence of copyright, so we have to wait for technology to improve to the point where re-mastering is extremely inexpensive.

In spite of the unintended humor and the overuse of clich&eacute;, this movie was worth watching, once, if you are a fan of Italian sword and sandals movies.  This movie is missing some of the things that most of these movies have, such as supernatural events, mythical creatures, heroes with magical powers, etc., but this movie does have the typical hero quest of those movies, using historical events as an inspiration.

By the way, the movie is lacking in actual giants.  I presume the ""giants"" were so based on historical significance rather than physical characteristics.  So, if you are looking for an actual giant, move on.

Side note:  Someone at Amazon has decided that reviews for this movie should appear for at least one collection that includes other movies.  While that collection probably has more value than a single movie, watch what you are buying.

Enjoy!",1341446400,,5773,4.842535787321063
8178542,3,B000NJMJZM,"This is a fun oldie.  The Druids have invented a secret weapon that is supposed to be able to stop and perhaps even destroy Julius Caesar, who must win in order to put down the intrigues against him in Rome.  He sends some fanatical warriors to find and destroy it, a desperate gambit that the cautious and analytical Caesar would never have depended on.  Along the bloody way, they have a number of adventures (sacrifice, tragedy, cowards, even love).  Amazingly, though the Druids invented no such thing, this is not simple superhero stuff, but filled with dark characters and some pretty good suspense.  I am sure I saw this when I was a kid, which makes this extra fun.  The Romans are kind of the good guys - honorable, brave, and devoted to Caesar - and the Gauls are  the cruel savages, but there are many surprises in the characters and their machinations.  There is a good finale of battle, and it ends just prior to the battle of Alesia.

REcommended as background fun.",1202256000,5,979,4.580459770114943
