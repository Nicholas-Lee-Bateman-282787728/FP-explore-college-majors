5087274,5,B007HW8U2Y,"This was a very well done documentary,video of the 60 years which Queen Elizabeth II has been monarch.
It was very interesting history,landmarking the highlights of her reign during the 60 years she has been Queen of England.",1341792000,,225,4.947368421052632
5087275,4,B007HW8U2Y,"A very nice look at Queen Elizabeth II and her enduring reign as Monarch of the British Empire.  60 Years is quite a good run for this Amazing Lady.  And, she was just 10 years old when she knew she would later become Queen.  Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooooraaay!!!",1340064000,6,254,4.25
5087276,5,B007HW8U2Y,"I just watched this 3-hour documentary last night, and it was fantastic.  The British reporter/narrator who followed the queen around, and interviewed numerous family members and British politicos including former prime ministers, did a great job.  The movies of the queen as a child were vivid, the interviews revealing, and there were numerous close-ups of the queen, and opportunities to listen to her speak, that one rarely gets to see.  The incident where the queen finally visited Ireland, and the reaction she got when she opened her remarks to a gathering of Irish notables in their native Irish tongue, was incredible--and showed why the queen is a woman like no other.  Also enjoyable were the interviews with at least 6 of the queen's grandchildren; it was touching to see how much they all greatly admire and adore their grandmother.  I doubt there has ever been--or will ever be--a monarch as great as Queen Elizabeth II, or who has served their country with more devotion than she has.  This documentary does a riveting job of showcasing this incomperable monarch.",1338768000,133,1078,5.02808988764045

5087282,5,B007HW8U2Y,"Especially in her diamond year, there was a glut of ""new"" material about QEII.  As an unabashed Anglophile, I bought a bit of it and watched all of the ceremonies on BBC America.  I already had a lot of documentaries about her and the Windsors.  This one appeared in parts on my local PBS station and I was able to catch only bits and pieces of it.  For the longest time, I did not realize there were THREE episodes in this program.

Of course, the slant of the program is completely pro-monarchy and flattering to the Queen - no problem for me!  This series offers input from most of the principal members of the Royal Family, which I loved.  Somehow the film-maker was able to balance their take on her while keeping her mystery intact.  There is an especially moving remembrance by Lord Mountbatten's grandson, who survived the IRA bombing which killed his grandfather and others, in which he describes being cared for and sheltered by the Queen and family at Balmoral immediately after he was released from the hospital.

The series is in basically three parts: 1) a basic overview of her and the Windsor family history; 2) what the Queen does and why she is so important to the British and indeed, the world; 3) challenges she has faced and weathered.  There are lots of new photos - at least new to me.  The one of her aboard the Britannia is worth the price of this series alone.

There were some really wonderful documentaries that came out to celebrate her Diamond Anniversary, including the wonderful 60 Glorious Years set.  What this one brought was unprecedented access - with her family.  Naturally, none of this could have been done without her help and support.  I am so glad that I went back and got the Diamond Queen.  It added yet another dimension to someone who truly is a Diamond Queen.",1413331200,,1807,4.582554517133956
5087283,5,B007HW8U2Y,very good,1407456000,,9,4.0
5087284,2,B007HW8U2Y,What a disappointment! This type of book should be ALL in color! Many pages are almost repetitive (copied) from other books about the queen and her jewels. Only the final pages contain an update of her jewels and how THE COMPANY borrows them for special occasions Very expensive. Very boring!,1407283200,,292,4.86
5087285,5,B007HW8U2Y,"Excellent documentary! And the commentary from those who know her and had personal stories to share were heart warming! Especially the Earl Mountbatten's grandson telling about her charging down the hall at Balmoral when he was released from the hospital and she had sent for them to be sent yo her, and it was like seeing a mother duck gathering in her young and showed the very human side of her",1407196800,,397,4.605633802816901
5087286,5,B007HW8U2Y,Very fine look into the reign and life of Elizabeth II and the world that changed dramatically during that time.  It gives an excellent view of her character and how she has also changed during her 60 years on the throne.,1390003200,2,221,4.390243902439025
5087287,5,B007HW8U2Y,"I had seen part of this DVD when it was broadcast on IPTV.  Because I had missed the last installment, I was eager to get the DVD.  It really is a fantastic tribute to the Queen.",1380672000,,178,3.9166666666666665
5087288,5,B007HW8U2Y,"My English ancestry came alive as I watched this. A long time ago, I was able to view the Queen as she drove by when I was visiting Stratford-upon-Avon.",1379203200,2,152,4.275862068965517

5087290,5,B007HW8U2Y,"This is an OUTSTANDING documentary about the life of Queen Elizabeth II and her 60 year (thus far) reign of Great Britain and the British Commonwealth.  The BBC did an excellent job of presenting the life, influence, and impact of Elizabeth upon her nation and empire.  Beginning as a youth, Elizabeth knew her responsibility of being a Princess during World War II in Great Britain, and the morale that the royal family had to contribute to the British people and the Commonwealth.  Interviews of the royal family and their thoughts about their famous mother, grandmather, and aunt enhance this highly entertaining and interesting documentary.  Interesting films, inverviews, and narration make this a must get to anyone who is interested in the modern history of Great Britain, the royal family, and the life of this most excellent queen.  Rare films and interviews give the viewer a glimpse inside her personal life and influence such as her father King George VI, and Elizabeth The Queen Mother.  Queen Elizabeth II daughter Princess Anne gives a rare interview and talks about the influence of her mother, other members of the royal family in the interviews are unabashed with their praise upon this great Queen and her influence in their lifes and nation.  This outstanding documentary is just over three hours long and it makes you wish it had many more hours to learn about the queen.

Elizabeth II has been queen of the British Nation for 60 years now and may she reign for many years more.  GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!!  Highly Recommended DVD!!",1374019200,3,1547,4.915384615384616
5087291,5,B007HW8U2Y,I watched this last year during the Diamond Jubilee and I enjoyed it immensely.  I have read the book of the same name and the DVD ties in very nicely to the book.,1371427200,,163,3.9393939393939394
5087292,5,B007HW8U2Y,I have visited England and Buckingham Palace so I enjoyed this video very much.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who had been to England or who is thinking about going there to visit.,1367625600,,189,4.4
5087293,5,B007HW8U2Y,"I love this video, and have watched it several times even though I had seen it on PBS. (As a matter of fact, that's why I purchased it).  I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the British Monarchy/history.",1366502400,,221,4.261904761904762
5087294,5,B007HW8U2Y,"Very interesting and more in-depth than the other documentaries I've seen about the Queen.  This is a wonderful woman:  graceful, dignified, dedicated, and doing a very difficult job.  I think she has done more for Great Britain than any other living person.",1364860800,,258,5.095238095238095
5087295,4,B007HW8U2Y,"I bought the DVD because I thought I'd seen the series on TV, as expected there's a lot of interesting material (if you've got a real interest in the Royal family, especially the Queen) that is divided into 3 segments and a ""montage"" thats a slide show with sound, some vocal, accompaniment. Each has recent and old footage along with still photography, some of each in b/w or color.
There's a section on how history has shaped the Royal family of today, it starts with George V
The following section was largely about Traditions and modern innovation as the family adjusts over time, I think this section had the most ""Diana"" stuff to it- if you don't like the late Princess, don't worry- she isn't heavily covered.
The final section I think was about defining moments during the Queen's reign.
Throughout the DVD several individuals speak about Her Majesty,each is identified by proper title. The Queen's children (Prince Charles speaks only once- in a 2008 interview- he's seen a few times in passing) speak in each segment, as do her grandchildren, (William, Harry, Beatrice & Eugenie speak most often of that generation), You see their husbands and wives (if any) but never in interviews. Several former, and the current, Prime Minister(s) speak as well.

The program aired before the big celebration day, all you get of that is a couple of computer generated images.

Lots of interesting footage, including the first I've seen of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 ( she was 78- the current Queen was 86 for her jubilee), but it can be boring if you're not really into it - you do have the option of watching it in segments.",1361232000,,1636,4.757042253521127
5087296,5,B007HW8U2Y,"I bought Diamond Queen because I love the history of the British royal family.  I am very facinated with the fact, that Queen
Elizabeth is one of the longest reigning monachs in history.  Diamond Queen gives you a better understanding of the Queens role in the working of the state and dealings with her prime ministers.  If you are interested in royal history, I highly recommend this product.",1359849600,,394,4.764705882352941
5087297,5,B007HW8U2Y,Beautiful movie but I just love even reading about the Royal family.  I come from Canada and have always keep up with everything they do.  Wish they would make more movie about the family on how they are really normal people with a job to do and a hard one at that.,1359590400,,265,4.076923076923077
5087298,5,B007HW8U2Y,"This loving, respectful review of the life of HM Queen Elizabeth II runs almost 3 hours. But, to cover a reign of 60 years, to be shorter would leave out many of the significant events in her life and in the history of Britain. I am an unabashed royalist. So when I watched it, I watched all three hours uninterrupted. For the average audience, it must be best viewed in sections.
Britain has only had two monarchs reach their Diamond Jubilee: Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth. But, in the case of HM Queen Elizabeth, she was photographed from birth and her every action documented. Her pledge to the British people was not only heard on radio throughout the commonwealth, but photographed as well. She has been photographed as a bride. She was photographed as a mother. Her coronation was the first to be televised. She has had a Silver Jubilee. She was photographed and filmed when Princess Diana died and the marriages of all her children were performed and ended in divorce, except for Prince Edward. She saw her home, Windsor Castle burn. She has had a Golden Jubilee. She has survived all trials and triumphs to see her Diamond Jubilee.
And she has done all of this with a quiet dignity, navigating the mistakes of her children, maintained the British Empire as Commonwealth, and is loved more now by her people than ever.
This is a beautiful, loving film for a beautiful, beloved woman who just happens to be HM the Queen.",1357603200,,1431,4.660079051383399

5087300,5,B007HW8U2Y,"An outstanding biographical work in three sections (each about 1 hour long), with much contemporary coverage of events during the past year and a half, so it is much more than the usual historical biography from birth to the present. At least 2/3 of this film details more current 21st century history, and how the Queen has succeeded at keeping up with changing times and continuing the relevance and popularity of the monarchy. Brilliantly filmed and well-presented throughout. Highly recommended!",1347580800,9,499,5.25

I already saw a lot of royal family Documentary's, and I believe that you would love this if you are a fan of that family.
The interviews with members of the royal family and world leaders are a great addition of the Documentary, which makes it even cooler.

8516901,5,B007HW8U2Y,"This lengthy DVD chronicles the life of the current Queen Elizabeth, focusing more on her public life and exploring exactly what role she plays in Great Britain and the Commonwealth and her relationship to government. Well narrated by a cheeky but very respectful Brit.

A film crew and the narrator accompany her for 18 months, from parts of England to the first trip in 100 years of a monarch to Ireland. She visits Ground Zero in NYC and the middle east, among other diverse cultures. Footage from past travels throughout her life are sprinkled throughout. I believe it mentions this Queen has travelled to over 135 countries?

The Queen's children and grandchildren are interviewed and give their insights and opinions on her reign, the longest in modern history. It's amazing to see the stamina this lady has and realize the world events she's witnessed in her lifetime. She's met numerous presidents and prime ministers as they've come and gone, yet she remains. Footage of her opening Parliament and presiding over functions offer fascinating insight of just how involved she is in making sure activities come off perfectly. She takes her role as Queen most serious, and committed to be in lifetime service to her people when she assumed her position at the age of 25.

This DVD is very worthwhile, whether you want to learn strictly about Queen Elizabeth II or if you also enjoy admiring her priceless jewelry and tiaras and unique color coordinated hats and coats. ",1475452800,,1474,4.931451612903226
