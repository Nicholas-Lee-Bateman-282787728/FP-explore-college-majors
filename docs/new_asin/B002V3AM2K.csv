8381769,5,B002V3AM2K,"Junichi Suzuki, in his Nisei Trilogy:  Toyo's Camera (life of Japanese-Americans and Japanese Nationals in Manzanar, through photographs), tells a compelling story of life in these unconstitutional concentration camps.  To complete the trilogy 442 - Live with Honor, Die with Dignity,  MIS - Human Secret Weapon tells of the bravery and sacrifice of Japanese American who fought bravely during WWII in both the European and Pacific theaters.

Born in Japan and immigrating to the US at 15 years of age, Toyo Miyatake became an award winning photographer in  Los Angeles  and in Japan.  When the war broke out, Toyo smuggled a homemade camera into Manzanar where he memorialized life in Americas concentration camps.  He captures in wonderful black and white stills, the stark reality of this life within barb wired fences, machine gunned guards and hastily built wooden barracks.  His photos touches the heart and attitudes that most of these internees had: Shigata Ga Nai  It cant be helped and Do not bring shame upon our family.

Every American should know this story of how hysteria, hate and greed can out maneuver constitutional guarantees and can happen today.

8381770,5,B002V3AM2K,"Really love this documentary, The Photographer Toyo A masterful Genius in capturing the Human Condition, and the way how he used, and had his camera made. Very Creative. I wish that the PBS channels would aired this than Sue Orman, It was very emotional, and and ashamed to admit that how the US Military & powers of the US Government at that time to be to intern US Citizens to these camps, Sure we had German Spies, and Yes their were Spies from Russia too during World War II.",1386374400,,479,4.393258426966292
8381771,5,B002V3AM2K,"A documentary which details the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII.  Emphasizes photos by Toyo Miyatake taken at the Manzamar Internment Camp, but also has photos at Manzamar by Ansel Adams as well as footage from films taken at the time plus current interviews of internees, George Takei and others.  Would highly recommend this DVD.",1354147200,,344,5.351851851851852
8381772,4,B002V3AM2K,"I am surprised that I am the first one who is writing a review for this film after entire three years!

Overall, this film is a little slow to watch. It shows a lot of photos. I think that it would be nice if they ask those people to tell us what  those adults, children do in the camps everyday. And they could have also told us stories of other japanese who lived in other camps, what their lives were like, etc. They could have gone beyond those photos, and gone into details, such as if the children can get books to learn, did they have their own schools, were those people allowed to go to hospitals if they were very sick, etc?

In its extra, it has a cartoon about the history. It is a little offensive when they used slanted eyes to portrait chinese. It listed four wrong things that the USA government did, it included the japanese camps, but they didn't think that that fact that Chinese were also racially discriminated, banned from immigrating to the USA was one of the wrong things.",1351555200,2,996,4.344086021505376
8381773,5,B002V3AM2K,This was a wonderful look into history through the eye of a camera.  It brought you right into the camp and lets you try to feel what it was like.,1308873600,,146,3.8666666666666667
