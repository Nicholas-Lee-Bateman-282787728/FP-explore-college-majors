8095041,4,B000C1F5IO,"This DVD shows you the proper technique for serving, forehand and backhand.  It is not very advance in visual presentation, but it does a good job with presenting and demonstrating the proper technique.  I was able to apply the instructions immediately.  It is worth the price.",1183420800,12,277,4.978260869565218
8095042,5,B000C1F5IO,This video is very well done.  Mike Pratt explains how to hit a backhand in great detail.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  There are also many demonstrations given so the viewer can see exactly what he is doing from several angles.  I highly recommend this video.,1178496000,13,284,4.62
