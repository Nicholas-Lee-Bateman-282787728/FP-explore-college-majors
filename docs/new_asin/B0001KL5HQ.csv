2008356,5,B0001KL5HQ,"If this sells well they will release more seasons. Oh I HOPE they release more seasons!
The first three discs contain all the episodes from the first season and the fourth disc is a special features disc. I won't spoil the fun but it does contain the pilot episode which is right on par with their regular stuff. I will say this much, remember the last KITH episode? Remember the sketch where Bruce is onstage and he watches part of a sketch with all the Kids sitting around a campfire? Well that sketch is from the pilot episode and this is probably the only way you will ever see it! (unless you could download it somehow... hmmm gives me an idea)
From watching the episodes Comedy Central aired I was under the impression that 'The Kids' came up with their characters initially and kept them going throughout all of their seasons. Not true. After watching the first season this is abundantly clear. Here we get several sketches from Gordon and Fran, Bobby Terrance, The Headcrusher, Thirty Helens, and The-Nobody-Likes-Us-Guys but sadly have to do without Sid and Charisse, Simon and Heckubus, Chicken Lady, Gavin, Francesca Fiore and many other fan favorites. Mississippi Gary is merely introduced along with glimpses of Cathy and Kathy and of course Buddy Cole.
Overall this was an AWESOME walk down memory lane. There are a few sketches that were never aired on comedy central (censored) and that alone makes it worth purchasing for any die-hard fan. Plus there are a few snippets that Comedy Central just cut out for no apparent reason at all. For example, when Mark stands outside of a house and keeps yelling for Lopez there is a brief segment I never even knew existed. (he makes up a little song about how Lopez is lazy)
In conclusion, this is a wise purchase for the casual fan and a godsend to a diehard like me.",1082160000,13,1825,4.6532507739938085
2008357,4,B0001KL5HQ,"Although a number of very good kids' sketches did come out during the first season, the material seen within this DVD is nowhere near the level of comedic genius as their later work (once the boys broke the confines of performing all of their work on stage).  That being said, I purchased the DVD for myself, not so much because I was planning on watching it, but  because I wanted to do my part to encourage the DVD release of the latter years of the kids' run.",1081123200,2,462,4.2988505747126435

2008359,5,B0001KL5HQ,"I have been waiting forever for them to start releasing the KITH!  I have always loved that show...I think it was so inventive, even better than SNL.

2008360,5,B0001KL5HQ,"This set is a real treat for Kids In The Hall fans with more than 8 hours of material plus every uncut show from season one. If you've never seen TKITH before, these shows will make you an instant fan; that's what happened to me after seeing just a couple of these early shows the first time years ago. The DVD includes new previously unseen interviews with the Kids and with producer Lorne Michaels, 30 minutes of performances from the Rivoli Theater show, plus audio commentary, sketches from the pilot episode, biographies, and even more.
If you appreciate comedy such as Monty Python's Flying Circus then you will thoroughly enjoy the demented surreal twists and zaniness found in this set, such as the sketch about ""The Eradicator"". The comedy in most sketches is very dense and holds up on repeated viewings, allowing you to pick up more bits of hilarity each time you see them. Very few shows this clever, funny and original have ever been on television. If you like entertainment with the aforementioned qualities and many layers of humor, such as Mystery Science Theater 3000, Black Adder, Fawlty Towers, The Simpsons or Red Dwarf, buy this Kids In The Hall set and you will not be disappointed. It will provide many hours of laughter. Incidentally, the theme music during the opening titles is terrific; it rocks!",1077580800,4,1323,4.807017543859649

2008391,5,B0001KL5HQ,"In the final season of The Kids in the Hall, the Canadian cult heroes pulled no punches in delivering some of their edgiest material ever. They had a bit of a creative stumble with roughly half of Season 4, possibly due to the transition from HBO to CBS, but Season 5 brought them right back up to the level of craziness from the first three seasons.

Husk Musk, farmer kicked by cow, Scott's Kids in L.A. monologue, Chicken Lady at the mall, Bruce being reviewed for a raise by his convenience store bosses, Feelyat, Kevin McDonald's vacation beard, the stolen gazeebo...there are just too many classic Kids skits in Season 5 to list them all. As a group, they hit a creative peak in Season 3, and this season is on par with that one. Totally random, hilariously farcical, and unafraid of offending, the show was in top form in these episodes. It's sad that the series had to end here, but they did a brilliant job with the finale, especially in the last skit where they all get fired from AT & Love and have to turn in their wigs. How fitting that they go out in dresses and make-up. There's also the glory of Hitler Blanks a Donkey. It was a depressing moment back when the last episode aired to see the final credits roll, with the Kids being buried alive in a mass grave, but it's a moment that gives way to unadulterated joy at seeing Bellini finally get the last word after marching through a field in his towel to walk on the grave and actually speak. If that sounds weird, that's good, because it ought to. It wouldn't be the Kids in the Hall without weird.",1453680000,,1566,4.381443298969073

2008394,1,B0001KL5HQ,"I bought the first season after having caught scattered episodes on TV in the past and having really enjoyed them. I remembered the humor being meta and unconventional. I recommended KITH to friends, skimmed the reviews for season 1 on Amazon, bought it for $30, and we all sat down to watch.

In the very first episode there is Mark McKinney in blatant blackface. I hadn't seen anyone talking about this before. No one in the reviews section here mentioned it. The season got 4.5 stars here. I just don't understand how that's possible. I'm putting 1 star in the hopes of affecting the aggregate rating and hopefully preventing someone else from making the same mistake I did.

I don't know if blackface was considered okay in Canada in 1989 -- I doubt it, but all right. We all felt extremely uncomfortable. I understand that KITH's thing is that they play different characters in various costumes and drag. I hadn't found their portrayal of women or lgbt people offensive, but impersonating black people using darkening makeup is a different thing. I know opinions vary on this, but please don't down-vote this review, because there are some people who consider any kind of blackface extremely offensive and will want to know about it before spending their money.

We stopped watching and I don't plan to go back. This review cost me $30 to write.",1447286400,,1350,4.785407725321888

I prefer absurd humor, and understand it's premise, but most of these skits seem to run pretty thin on concept and often go nowhere at all. It's often almost as if they wrote themselves into a corner and did not know how to get out, and sometimes the punch lines just fall flat in an almost embarrassing way.",1390435200,,468,4.329545454545454

This is definitely the season for ""Bruce"" fans, since you can sense a lot of his odd, offbeat humor here.  Many of the skits are superbly produced, and actually look more well directed than many movies.

The bad: I'd still have to say there's quite a few skits that fall short of noteworthy, which is why I can't give this an additional star.  Specific gripes: Scott is hilarious in other people's skits, but often becomes unfunny when he stars in his own material.  Bruce seems to have been allowed to go off on his merry, artistic way, and unfortunately, his artistic journey does not always coincide with ""funny.""  There are attempts by all of them to push the envelope, but maybe it's just a fact that comedy ages, and what might seem shocking back then seems boring now.  I often found myself waiting impatiently for the unfunnier skits to end.

There is nothing better than good comedy, and nothing worse than bad comedy.  Season 5 has both.

This season beats the lackluster Season 4 for sure, but I'd still have to go with season 1-3 as the creme de la creme of KITH.  If you are a diehard fan, get all 5 seasons.  If you aren't, I'd recommend only the first 3 sets.",1206662400,,1282,4.454935622317596

Flash forward 15 years or so, and I just bought the first season on DVD. As far as I'm concerned, the skits have lost none of their punch over the years. The comedy never really revolved around satirizing current events, the skits were always more of a droll commentary on society in general. So the humor still resonates almost twenty years later: Kathy and Cathy still portray the mundane and backbiting culture of office life, Fran and Gordon are still your quintessential suburban parents, and Buddy Cole is still a brilliant parody of the gay community.

In my opinion, ""The Kids in the Hall"" is probably the best sketch comedy show of all time.",1196208000,,914,4.852564102564102

Scott Thompson's queer sensibility bleeds through more often than not, pushing the homophobic buttons right and left. This tension and the ""gayness"" tends to put some people off, but then KITH were always an acquired taste. The final season begets an even more thoroughly warped worldview than the previous four, and repulsive characters, such as McKinney's ""Chicken Lady"" get full-frontal exploration. There is a vibe that time is running out, so why-not-go-for-it, and KITH does, in a big way! If you're a fan, then this review is unnecessary -- you already own this.

CONTENT:
Dude. I bought season one and two at the same time because I looooooved the kids in the hall. I watched it all the time on Comedy Central. Loved it. I always knew there were some crappy sketches, but most were true comedy gold.... when I was 15.

So far, now into the middle of disc four, I've laughed out loud exactly twice, feigned a giggle once or twice to make myself feel better about the purchase, and the rest of the time I've done nothing but stare blankly at the screen.

I wish I could say it was hilarious, I wish I could tell you it's one of the best things ever put on DVD, but it's just not. Most of the jokes are too obvious, and when they're not, they're just stupid. There are some great ones, the two guys who say ""Nobody likes us"", or ""Sarcastic guy"",  but that's pretty much it, and not worth the price of admission to slog through the muck that is the rest of this series.

Hopefully season two is better?",1187568000,,1192,4.351351351351352
2008630,5,B0001KL5HQ,"I'm a long-time fan of The Kids In the Hall, and in the nineties I would tape the shows off Comedy Central and watch them over and over again.  For this reason, I never really had a sense of what shows came from what season.  So, with the release of each season of The Kids in the Hall on dvd, I would watch in the hopes of catching certain skits that would pop into my head and that I would long to see again.  In turn, each season delivered classic skits, too many to list here.  But with each season, I would think ""well, maybe those skits you're looking for will be in the next dvd release.""  And finally, the fifth season was released.  And all of my absolute personal favorites are on it.  The weird game show, ""Feelyat,""  Buddy Cole taking delivery of his new sex slave, Bruce shining Kevin's shoes and ruminating about his hands...and something else, the very clean town and how it got that way, Bruce being kidnapped and having his boots stolen, Kevin's character Mr. Tisane going through the de-teas, Husk Musk, what you get when you mate a cow and a pig,  a loud, obnoxious American who needs to buy crab shampoo...  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  To me, the fifth season is the most perfect of all the seasons.  By this season, the troupe had mastered how to effectively utilize television to get their comedy across, and while there are recurring characters from seasons past, they're not overused.  There's still plenty that's fresh and bizarre so that by the time you get to the last episode you can't help but really feel that something was lost that we'll never have again when they wrapped this incredible series.",1185148800,8,1637,4.489864864864865

2008647,5,B0001KL5HQ,"I have developed a very unhealthy and socially detrimental habit lately of watching the same sketches from this season over and over again. Something about the facial expressions and perfect delivery of the ""Sarcastic Guy"" sketch make me need to watch it at least every month, and to quote bits of it to my sister so that she starts cracking up in fond memory. Season 1 was all self-penned by members of the troupe, I believe, and it has no shortage of classics from shocking absurdism--which seems to come from Brucio, while the really candidly ""offensive"" stuff comes from Scott (not ""shocking"" in the sense of overt taboo-crushing ""pornographic style, just shocking in the ""how did they come up with this? and yet i understand!"" way), classic style wit and above-par insult humor (seems like dave), spot-on body language and tone-of-voice parody (Of, say, dynamics of a very tense family or the emotionally aloof guy that challenges everything you say and makes you feel tiny).  The McGuillicutty and Green sketch is a classic. I think ""Three For the Moon"" is genius, ""Tony Comes to Dinner"" is a brilliant send up of a youth trying desperately to be alienated by her parents, ""Pear Dream"" made me laugh harder than anything I've ever seen, ""Womyn"" is great in some of its subtleties, ""To Reg,"" ""Fat Hitchiker,"" ""Sick of the Swiss (WHAT???)"" and a lot of those brief openers like ""Deja Vu"" and the ""Living Dead.""

Personally, I could do without all those Thirty Helens bits-- the humor is so-so but the format is slow and not that exciting. Head Crusher had a lot of insightfully funny lines in this season but they brought him back too often in sketches that weren't verbal enough. Cabbage Head's only strong point is his appeals to pity which i know plenty of people use to get some.

I'll admit there's a bit of mediocrity in this season, but when trying to compile the innovative, super-intelligent rebellious stuff and that which is worth seeing for its originality at least once, i'd still have at least 3 discs.

2008650,1,B0001KL5HQ,"Sorry to give you the bad news about this DVD set, but...

I love the Kids in The Hall, but found the Complete Season One  dissapointing. I remember some wonderful and very humorus skits in Season One that were not included in this set...such as the crushing the head man with his friend Misha who interupts the play he is putting on. The actors in his play are his fingers. As he goes to crush her head, she sticks her thumb in front of one eye and says ""there's no body home"", so it appears that her thumb is covering his head... But this skit isn't in here. Why?

As a lover of the head crusher, the only head crushing episodes in Season One are when he crushes business men's heads and runs into a little boy in a suit and asks him ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" the little boy responds ""A business man!"" -- he consquently gets his head crushed. Funny, but not the best or most memorable of the head crusher.

I also was disspointed in Buddy Cole in this DVD set. There were some wonderful Buddy Cole segments in the first season that are not in this set (how about the one when he is in jail and his tin cup is shaped like a champagne glass?), The same for the chicken lady (blind date, attending wedding to the bearded lady, or phone sex line) and cabbage head (I loved it when he invited himself along to join a bunch of women who were trying to have dinner, as he sits in a lawn chair with a sex book and asks questions). I also loved the skit where a woman (played by one of the Kids in drag) sits at an outdoor cafe, is annoyed by a terrible waiter and suffers further aggravation from the ""dirty man standing behind the fence"" who is trying to bum cigarettes for ""his kids"" from her. Or, how about the guy that stubbed his toe and doesn't want to go to the doctor because he found the colors of his infected toe ""interesting!""  Not one of these hillarious skits or episodes are included in the Season One DVD Collection...Why?

God only knows who compiled the collection of sometimes boring comedy skits in the Season One DVD collection, but I can tell you one thing. There is no way this is a complete collection of the entire Season One episodes. It is incomplete, to say the least. I just gave you many examples of my favorites that are missing. It would have been great to see them again and have them to enjoy for posterity. It was that kind of humor that endeared us all to The Kids In The Hall so much.

The skits included in this collection are probably not the most popular or funny episodes. I would not recommend it. Take it from me...save yourself twenty or thirty bucks.

I have not seen the other DVD collections from the other Kids In The Hall Seasons on DVD as yet. One can only hope that they will be more entertaining than Season One was (or should I say, wasn't)...

2008652,5,B0001KL5HQ,"Nominated for 3 Emmys and 18 Gemini Awards, including five straight for Best Comedy Series, The Kids In The Hall is a legendary sketch comedy troupe whose hilarious skits have achieved cult icon status among comedy aficionados. Named after famed comedian Jack Benny's penchant for beginning a joke by saying, ""I got this from the kids in the hall"" (a line referring to amateur comedians outside his office), The Kids In The Hall formed in Canada in 1984. However, the group parted for a short time when members Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney were hired as writers for the NBC show Saturday Night Live. When the group reunited, SNL producer Lorne Michaels attended a Kids In The Hall performance and loved what he saw. He had an instant vision of the group in its own sketch comedy series, and in 1988, The Kids In The Hall premiered on HBO...

The Kids In The Hall took full bloom in the late-1980s/early-1990s when the success of Saturday Night Live made sketch comedy a hot commodity. In this atmosphere, new series like In Living Color, MADtv, and The Kids In The Hall, were ripe for breakout success. Sporting a small regular cast of five (with extensive experience working together), The Kids In The Hall quickly gained a loyal and devoted audience. Cast members Dave Foley (later of Newsradio), Bruce McCulloch, Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney, and Scott Thompson, for the most part, wrote their own material and performed their own sketches, providing the show with edge in creativity in regard to its contemporaries. This synergy between cast members and writers earned three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Variety or Music Program (whew! that's a long award title) and garnered The Kids In The Hall the credit and respect it deserves as one of the premiere sketch comedy shows in television history...

The Kids In The Hall (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which the cast perform a number of skits such as Call Girls, The Eradicator, Ballet, The Head Crusher, and even one sketch which reveals the true cause of cancer...

2008653,5,B0001KL5HQ,"This is an awesome debut of the KTH series. The sketches are very thought out, and really show a unique talent for these ""kids"". My favorites are ""Cathy Strupp and Kathie Lassiter"", ""Darci"", ""Stinky Pink"" and let us Not forget ""Buddy Cole"" boy!",1115424000,,244,4.6976744186046515
2008674,5,B0001KL5HQ,"The Kids in the Hall was that comedy troupe for those wanting something a bit more realistic and adult than ""Saturday Night Live"", while also catering to that audience that felt that ""the State"" was a bit too overwhelming.  So, The Kids in the Hall found the niche, and they exploited it in the most original and entertaining way possible.  The created skits that not just reflected the absurdities of everyday life, but also released some of the most vivid characters ever to cross the small screen.  Scott Thompson, Kevin McDonald, Dave Foley, Mark McKinney, and Bruce McCulloch created some of the funniest bits of comedy and on just their first season out.

Normally, when you pick up the first season of any television program it sometimes carries that feeling of old or out-dated.  That is completely not the case with this first season of Kids in the Hall.  These five comedians have created skits that have lasted the test of time and still remain relevantly funny today.  Their views on business, the family dynamics, the gay community, and everything else in between is strangely parallel to our culture today (and this was made in 1989-1990).  To demonstrate the craftiness of their humor, I found myself rewinding some of the episodes to laugh again and again.  While there were some amazing ones scattered throughout the first season that I just fell in love with, the final episode on the third disc is by far my favorite ever.  It felt as if they had broken their hypothetic shell, and really took charge of their craft.  Another great element to this season is that you get all of these guys uncensored, so the comedy comes to you firsthand.  I guess from watching them on Comedy Central, you don't really see their darker side (as often), but in this uncensored season it comes full force and in style.

Overall, I was extremely impressed with this debut season.  These guys are hysterical, imaginative, bold, creative, and has a ear to the pulse of society.  While it seems that in the long run their humor was not appreciated as much and it is hard to find these guys doing powerful work today, they will always have a place in my home in my DVD player.  For anyone who loves to laugh, especially at yourself, this is the perfect season for you!  I was very impressed!

2008675,5,B0001KL5HQ,"This is a collection of some of the best Kids in the Hall sketches, complete with the naughty words that kept some of these sketches off of your local tv stations when the repeats were put on the open airwaves.  The comedy is as hilarious today as it was then; ""business men"" handing-out out, and sniffing eachother's business cards, while exchanging incomprehensible ""Biz"" jargon, that we have come to know as terms such as ""team player,"" ""on the page,"" ""and similar catch- phrase crap dialog.  Thirty Helens Agree that this dvd set is an absolute must have!  And how could you resist Buddy, after all he's Canadian!

So- add this set to your cart you smartguy or what-e-ver you are, while you still have time!  For I am crushing your head! Crush, Crush, Crush!",1102896000,4,762,4.656716417910448
2008676,4,B0001KL5HQ,"The Kids in the Hall is a Monty Python/Saturday Night Live style sketch show starring five young guys from Canada including David Foley who would later star in News Radio and Mark McKinney of Saturday Night Live.  Some of the regular characters are the guy who likes to ""crush"" the heads of businessmen and other poor souls by tormenting them from a distance and pinching his fingers together, and a womanizing cad who tries to gain sympathetic booty by pointing out the obvious cabbage he has for a head.  Some of my favorite sketches are Scott Thompson's gay monologues (""You know the feeling you get when you're not sure if it's a s*** or a f*rt but you let it rip anyway?"").  Bonus features include fan favorite clips from the pilot season and an interesting and very well done ""oral history"" told through recent interviews with the ""kids,"" as well as commentaries.  As Foley states in his interview, this anti-establishment comedy show enjoyed more freedom in the first season because it was ""under the umbrella"" of Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels.  A lot of their humor is fresh and original but there is definitely a Monty Python influence with such ideas as ""Thirty Helens Agree"" and the kids playing all the female roles in their sketches (particularly old ladies).  The Kids in the Hall is actually not one of my favorite comedies as a lot of their sketches are slow moving and sometimes end abruptly with no real punch line, but this package is so well done I added a star to the score. For those who like the craziness of SNL or the irreverent humor of Monty Python (they might almost top the Python clan with their sinfully funny Dr. Seuss Bible), Kids has its moments and is worth picking up.  It's worth it for the theme music alone. Of course, fans need to own this set. As David Foley states, ""the rest is history if it were more important.""",1102809600,2,1863,4.610271903323262
2008677,3,B0001KL5HQ,"Apparently, there are some people who think that Season 1 is ""the bomb"", as the kids used to say. These people are obviously deranged and you should stay away from them.

The first season has some great moments, to be sure. They mostly come near the end. Dr Seuss Bible is almost worth the set, and the Vaudeville routine is great too. There are quite a few laughs, but they come at intervals. A lot of this material was worked out when the Kids were stage performers, and it retains that theatrical feel, but not in a good way. Their chemistry hasn't quite clicked yet, either, and there's a lot of stuff that's obviously been pushed through rather than collaborated on.

That said, it IS funny, and contains some classic sketches. The Kids are probably the second best collection of sketch comedy artists, behind only the Pythons. SNL has had some great years, but never the consistency and sheer audacity of the Kids when they were hitting all cylinder. By all means, do pick up Season 2. If you like it, come back and take a peek at how it all began.",1102464000,3,1054,4.484375

It gives you a complete list of the easily accessable episodes and what skits are in each one. The bonus stuff is awesome,though I haven't watched all of it yet. I also loved how the dvd lets you control your Kids-fix. If you only have time for a quick skit, you can go right to which skit you want.

2008680,5,B0001KL5HQ,"If you have never seen the ""Salty Ham"" sketch on Kids in the Hall, (on DVD 1 of this four DVD set) well, I hate to break it to you, but you do not know what Funny is.

You've met Funny. Sometimes Funny nods at you when you pass him on the street. At times, Funny has even gone so far as to hit the breaks on his car slightly earlier, so he doesn't splash you with muddy rain water when Funny is speeding by with his supermodel girlfriend in his Audi. And once, you caught a glimpse of Funny and his friends waiting for a table at Morton's, while you and your half-brother and his wife were rushing to The Olive Garden for half-price stuffed mushrooms. You thought that Funny might have noticed you, in the second row of that gray and blue Aerostar van, but you're not really sure. And when you had that summer party recently, you invited Funny, but he didn't show up. You had heard rumors that he was at your friend Jim's house, grilling bratwurst and wearing an apron that said I'm With Stupid, but again, you can't be quite sure.

However, were you to see the sketch, ""Salty Ham"", Funny would be calling you every hour on the hour, would be e-mailing you to the point of intrusion, and might even be the friend to pick you up when the tire on your 1995 Mitsubishi Scoupe blows out, again.

y'all know what you have to do.  Buy the set.",1093478400,10,1337,4.2109375
2008681,5,B0001KL5HQ,"The great thing about Kids in the Hall was that they shunned the topical, obvious humor so common within the ranks of SNL, MAD TV, In Living Color, Ben Stiller and so forth. KITH relished the subtle quirks of everyday existence: inanely busy businessmen, a mullet-headed slacker obsessed with his beat-up heap of a used car, or the morose ""nobody likes us"" outcasts who hang themselves just to make a point. Granted, all of these are not gems; truth be told, the Kids hadn't yet hit full stride as they would in later seasons. You may have to suffer through a few clunkers but it is all worth it. Personally I think the risk-reward is worth it for the edgy elements and oddball genius. If you want to be this creative and be truly landmark then you can't always grab the obvious punchline. Long live the Kids! can't wait for the stronger seasons to come out.",1090195200,8,858,4.506410256410256
2008682,5,B0001KL5HQ,"Man, this is easily the best set of DVD`s I have in my house. My wife and I stay up late almost every night and watch them and find ourselves laughing out loud! We first started watching it back in the 80`s when it was on HBO and loved it. We would occasionally watch it on comedy central but it just wasn`t the same with all the editing. The best part is that you can watch any skit you like and skip the ones that you don`t.
  It was interesting to get some history on the kids from the bonus material disc and hear how they got along with each other. It must`ve been a blast on that set.
  All in all, this was the best money I`ve spent in quite a while and I can`t wait for season 2. Go buy it!",1087516800,12,698,3.86013986013986
2008683,5,B0001KL5HQ,"This has some great shows and all 5 play many different charecters. They play very brilliant carectors and they are all quite funny. I wish Comedy Central would stop showing that Mad TV crap that is gross-and not funny where as this and SNL were
very gross but extremally funny. Comedy Central I want to see this and Saturdaynight go back to the classics not the retarded Mad TV that is very unfunny don't support that crap",1086998400,4,423,4.5064935064935066
2008713,4,B0001KL5HQ,"The Kids in the Hall was a brilliant show. It is so much funnier than Saturday Night Live, and more timeless, too. Saturday Night Live spends most of its time making fun of celebrities, current events, and trends. After a few years it loses its edge. The Kids make fun of life and people's quirks. Sketches from '89 hold up just as well as they did fifteen years ago.
There are many great moments in this set. A husband and wife fighting in the middle of the night over a salty ham, a punk-ish banker lamenting about his job (and using the f-word liberally), an elderly man pooping for the first time in four years, a Vaudeville act with the worst straight-man in history, and many more which are kind of hard to explain. Actually, one of the best parts about Kids in the Hall sketches is how baffling they can be. Many sketches don't have a real joke; you just laugh at how absurd they are.
Despite my praise, the first season does not show the Kids at their finest. Many sketches fall flat; others start funny but drag on far too long. Most of this is good stuff, but you can tell the Kids haven't perfected their craft yet. But I'm not sure we'll get to the good stuff if more people don't buy this one. So I urge you: If you like the Kids, please fork over some money. I mean, I think this set is worth the money on its own, but you'll also help ensure seasons 2 through 5, which are even better.",1086307200,5,1400,4.227611940298507
2008714,5,B0001KL5HQ,"I have been waiting for this set since the TV on DVD trend started. This is a great package and has the beginnings of the greatness that is the Kids in the Hall. From the first appearance of Buddy Cole to their spin on SNL's Land Shark (""Skooora!"") - to me, this box set is the greatest thing since sliced bread!",1085443200,5,312,4.131147540983607
2008715,5,B0001KL5HQ,"These guys were trying to do something different, and they did.  They interjected much of the feel of ""acting"" and roleplaying and their own personalities into state-of-the-art sketch comedy.
And their sketches focused on real elements of life (the family unit, the work environment) in ways that hadn't been done before.  And they were FUNNY as heck some of the time.  And overly effete and surreal some of the time - which is true of Monty Python's Flying Circus as well if you really get down to it.
If you like Monty Python, SCTV, Saturday Night Live, and/or the great underknown ""Mr. Show"" you should definitely give these guys a spin.  They did great work together.  The set looks good and the extras on Disc 4 are quite good and promote a better understanding of what this group was doing and what they were about.",1085356800,,821,4.63448275862069
2008716,5,B0001KL5HQ,"For anyone who appreciates the madness of Monty Python, the Kids in The Hall are a great second-helping of sketch comedy that doesn't fall into the trap SNL did (of putting easily-accessible to a wider audience over subtle and intelligent). The five Canadians who are chronicled in this first season are fresh-faced young men who know what kind of comedy they want to achieve, even if the rest of the world's a bit unsure what to make of them.
I first came across the Kids in college, a few years back, when Comedy Central began airing reruns from their long-ended TV show. I may not be as devoted as some KITHers in terms of memorizing skits and catchphrases, but I am truly in the camp of people who think the Kids are fantastic.
This DVD set is much-analyzed in previous reviews, and i haven't fully enjoyed all the episodes, but from what I have been able to gleam in my four days of owning it I can say it's a fantastic buy. Not everything works, but the sketches that do are bar none some of the best-written and -acted material in all comedy.
The first few seasons were broadcast on HBO (before a network switch to CBS in the early Nineties, when I stumbled across them but didn't ""get"" them yet) and thus there's a lot of cursing that didn't make it onto the Comedy Central-aired eps. Ocasionally the proceedings get a bit more odd than funny, but anyone who appreciates the Kids knows that was part of their charm.
The bonus fourth disc features the interviews and voiceovers on certain sketches (""That's the one we bombed on Letterman""), and is a nice companion to the series.
Overall, I say this is an essential buy for anyone who loves the Kids, or is a Python nut but not familiar with them, or anyone who simply loves fantastic comedy. Lorne Michaels gave them their start, then wisely stepped back and let the Kids do their own thing. This is the ultimate sketch comedy show of the post-Python era, and a worthy successor (maybe I'm aking too much of the Python references, but it's my review. Go write your own, Python-free review and leave me alone). Go buy it now, you'll laugh your butt off guarenteed.",1085097600,7,2121,4.526041666666667
2008717,4,B0001KL5HQ,"As others have noted, the first season is a bit hit-and-miss: the first few episodes are great, the next ten episodes or so are sporadically funny at best, and the final five episodes foreshadow the brilliance that would become the hallmark of the Kids in later seasons.  What's fascinating about these episodes is to see their evolution from stage troupe to television sketch comedy writers.  The earlier episodes suffer slightly from an unsuccessful transference of material from stage to screen (though ""Citizen Kane""--which seems like a stage piece--totally works).  Later in the first season, they start taking advantage of TV gimmicks to make more successful bits (like ""Mechanic"" from Episode #15 or the ""Premise Beach"" sketches from Episode #18). I will select my five favorite sketches from each disc--
Disc One (Episodes 1-6)
The Eradicator (#1)
Cause of Cancer (#1)
Womyn (#2)
Citizen Kane (#3)
Elvis (#5)
Disc Two (Episodes 7-13)
Teddy Bears' Picnic (#9)
McGuillicutty and Green (#10)
Folk Music (#12)
Skoora! (#12)
Indian Woman (#13)
Disc Three (Episodes 14-20)
Manny Coon (#16)
Power of My C--k (#16)
She's Gone (#18)
Tarantula (#19)
Buddy Holly (#20)
The bonus disc features a nice documentary about the early years of the troupe as well as highlights from their pilot episode.  The commentaries on the sketches are not particularly informative, and Scott Thomson is not present for much of the commentaries, which is a drawback.  A must, obviously, for fans of ""Kids in the Hall"" as well as fans of subversive television sketch comedy.",1084665600,5,1551,5.138888888888889
2008718,4,B0001KL5HQ,"Like great art, The Kids in the Hall are not meant to be liked by all, but loved by a few. The first season sees some highs and lows that remind me why I love them and why some see no point in the Canadian series.
While ""These are the Daves I know"" and ""Thirty Helens Agree"" keep me in stitches, some of the sketches (especially the overplayed ""Crushing Your Head"" in the first episode) grow less humorous and more tedious as the episode goes on.
I recommend this for fans of Kids in the Hall (obviously) and those who enjoy ""The Simpsons,"" ""Mr. Show with Bob and David,"" and any of the late night fare on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It's not always funny, but wait a minute and it'll get better.",1084406400,,698,4.2556390977443606
2008719,4,B0001KL5HQ,"Scott Thompson was recently quoted as saying he couldn't believe they ever got past a first season.  I can see his point, on many levels.
When the skits were good - they were great.  When they weren't, they were still ok (unlike, say SNL).  But in massive doses (like in a multi-disk set), the mediocre ones seem painful sometimes.
BUT - the first season contains the best Buddy Cole sketch ever.  Plus the Daves I Know, The Dr. Seuess Bible, 30 Helens Agree and a number of other great scenes.
The series did get better as they got experience - and looking forward to those releases.  Great package for the fans - and a good one for anyone getting initiating to KITH (though a little pricey).",1083888000,6,693,4.468253968253968

Daring, in your face  sketch comedy that on the one hand doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, but on the other hand is certainly NOT politically correct.  FUNNY, as in laugh-out-loud funny. If you like SNL ( when it WAS funny ) Monty Python, Second City, etc then you'll like Kids in the Hall.",1083542400,2,376,4.5
2008721,5,B0001KL5HQ,"Just having all of Season 1 of The Kids in the Hall on DVD would makes this worth any fans' hard earned cash. But there's more. The Oral History segment is fantastic. It chronicles the Kids rise to (sort-of) success as told by the Kids themselves. The interviews are at once informative, insightful, and hilarious. You get a glimpse into each of the Kids' beginnings and personalities. Most importantly, you get a sense of the group dynamic. It's interesting to hear what the Kids have to say about one another.
Then you have the audio commentary for the pilot episode and the season 1 favorites. I know there was a lot of press about the in-fighting going on in the group around the time you movie came out, but listening to the commentary you get nothing but a sense of friendship between them.
The Rivoli sketches are another wonderful thing for a true KITH fan to have. True, the video is grainy and a few times the camera wanders around, but it doesn't matter because it's just great to see them in the days when they were just beginning as a group.
And of course, anyone who buys this probably knows about the actual sketches. I'll just say that the sketches definitely hold up. In fact, as I've watched the DVD I've grown to love season 1 more and more instead of getting sick of it. You find something new everytime you watch a sketch.
