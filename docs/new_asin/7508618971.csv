8078536,1,7508618971,The film receives no rating from me because what I received from the vendor with whom I placed my order for the DVD was a copy of a Japanese novel written in Japanese. How a Japanese language novel - paperback - can be expedited in the place of a French Language DVD leaves me to wonder... I shall try again to procure the DVD and a proper evaluation will follow.,1405987200,,363,4.2
