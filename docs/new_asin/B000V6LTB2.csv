Could it have been more professionally done? Probably, but still a very intimate DVD and well worth the price. Loved it. Well done Mike Freeman, Elvis would be proud.",1422403200,,332,4.741379310344827

traveling the footsteps of Elvis.",1395014400,,133,5.65
8216892,4,B000V6LTB2,"ELVIS' MEMPHIS is a very good 2-DVD set that shows a lot of places in and around Memphis that pertain to Elvis Presley. Mike Freeman is the congenial and knowledgeable host. To an extent this is also a general tour of Memphis, as with Sun Studios and Beale Street, but a lot of segments mainly pertain to Elvis, such as a ranch that he bought near Memphis, some churches he attended, restaurants he frequented, and so on.

Freeman goes inside several sites, but often he stands outside and talks about Elvis's connection to a place, and in some cases a building doesn't even exist any more, so we see where it used to be. When Freeman couldn't go inside somewhere, it would have helped if at least photos of the interior were shown. As, photos of Elvis inside his Audubon Drive home are famous, and showing some of these would have been great as Freeman stands outside the home and talks about it. Maybe there were legal or practical impediments - as, it's disappointing that the inside of Graceland is not shown, but I suppose that was impossible. I came across a DVD tour of Graceland on Amazon, which is entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Presley-s-Official-Graceland-Complete-Tour-DVD/dp/B000SBE7GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Presley's Official Graceland Complete Tour DVD</a>, though I have not watched it so I don't know if it's a good one or not.

However, there's LOTS of stuff on here, as the discs run over 3 hours total! Part of that is interesting and lengthy discussions Freeman has with several people, especially Elvis's friend George Klein, and also the owners of a couple of restaurants, a movie theater, and Lansky Brothers clothing store. Picture quality is decent and at a 1.33:1 ratio, and overall production quality is decent too. Also, I like the instrumental music played as Freeman travels from one site to another, but it's never so loud as to interfere with his talking. So, if you're interested in a tour of places in Memphis connected to Elvis, this 2-DVD set is just the thing for you.",1239494400,,2076,5.067251461988304
8216893,3,B000V6LTB2,"Considering it was just a narrated tour, and quite long at that, I found myself loving every minute it. Of course, I am a diehard Elvis fan and love anything about Elvis, so take my response in that light. If you are not a big fan, you may not find this DVD too entertaining.",1202601600,2,275,4.111111111111111
8216894,5,B000V6LTB2,"This dvd was very enjoyable and one every Elvis fan should add to their collection.  Mike Freeman takes you to many of the places Elvis visited and hung out in Memphis.  Everything from Humes high school to Circle G ranch to the places he lived to a restaurant he frequented is covered in this dvd.  The indepth conversation with George Klein is very enjoyable and the ""roll story"" made me laugh.  Basically, if you ever wanted to know the places Elvis frequented or just wanted a new fun and informative dvd on Elvis...this is a must!",1195344000,14,535,4.541666666666667
