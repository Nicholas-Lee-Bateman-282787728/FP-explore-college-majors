8205742,4,B000SL1WQM,"Beautifully photographed, and mostly very well acted (with a few over-the-top moments), this is a complex, odd, and often fascinating look at the relationship between two brothers in Italy.

It shows one day in their life each year between 1958 and 1964, avoiding movie convention by not filling in the details of what's gone on during the time in between. It's left to us to figure out, or imagine how they got to where they are.

While brave and challenging,I was sometimes frustrated that the characters never quite fully develop, occasionally feeling more sketchy and symbolic than full blooded.

Early on I excitedly felt I might be watching a masterpiece. But as it went evolved, I felt (to quote Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenberg) `guilty for not liking it more'. Still, a strong and original enough film that I'd like to revisit it one day, and see if it grows even deeper on 2nd viewing.",1437004800,,903,4.812903225806451
