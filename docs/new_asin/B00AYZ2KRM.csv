8559397,5,B00AYZ2KRM,"I love heavy weight training and this is why I love Xtrain Chest, Back & Shoulders.

Here is why I enjoy this workout:

* The sense of challenge. I took the time to do my 1 rep max tests and it really made a difference.  I could go heavier than Miss Cathe on several of the exercises.

* Each exercise is only done once.  Psychologically, I could give each exercise my all because I knew I wouldn't have to do it again.

* The workout structure.  There is very little down time between exercises, but that's okay since each set has a chest exercise, a back exercise and a shoulder exercise.  So each body part is resting while you're working another body part.

* The way your core is worked with every exercise.  It's nice to work the core without crunches or planks.  Because of the positions you're holding, you are working your core.  Cathe is great at reminding you to hold in your core.

* The manageable pushups.  I don't like pushups even though I know they are excellent for your chest and arms.  Cathe tends to have overkill on pushups, but not in this workout.  You do 3 different types of pushups, tempo at the start, reach tap tap in the middle of the workout and standard at the end.  Yes, the pushups are tough, but they're over before you know it and you're on to something else.

* The back work with the bands.  I especially love the band pull and how it really gets into my back.

* The nice mix of equipment.  All you need are dumbbells, tubing and a stability ball.

This workout clocks in at 51 minutes. While it is very helpful to do your 1 rep max tests, it is not necessary.  Cathe tells us what weight she is using, so you can use this as a guide.  It has the usual mix of longer and shorter premixes.  The bonus workouts include:  Core #1 and 100 Rep Challenge Lateral Raises.

If you love strength training, this workout is for you!",1365120000,6,1860,4.2701149425287355
