3029263,4,B000YIGNKY,"Having just finished viewing The IT Crowd (which is awesome by the way), I was anxious to check out another Graham Lineham series. Father Ted didn't quite measure up to the perfection that is The IT Crowd, but it was certainly a very funny & enjoyable series. I'm very glad that I picked it up. Do yourself a favor & give this series a shot.",1227312000,,341,4.2615384615384615
3029264,5,B000YIGNKY,"Apparently the definitive Collection is not necessary if you already own The Holy Trilogy.  That being said, I did not, and therefore found this to be a necessity to my tv on dvd collection.  Although most of the special features aren't vital, it's nice to see Ted & Dougal's TV spots and to here the actor who portrayed Dougal joke about on his commentaries.  If you've already seen Father Ted, and enjoy it, this is worth the price, and will provide plenty of laughs for you, and the people you know who weren't fortunate enough to stumble upon this on there own.  If you haven't seen this show, well a brief synopsis would be it focuses on three priests (In the looses sense) one a monosyllabic drunkard, another a man child, and the third, the title character, just happens to always be in the wrong place in the wrong time (and is probably an embezzler) and how they really want to just be normal people (which doesn't stop them from using there priest status when it benefits them) on an island of the mainland of Ireland full of people who are the farthest thing from normal.  Watch an episode first and if you like 1, you'll like all 25 episodes.",1218931200,30,1154,4.476190476190476
3029265,5,B000YIGNKY,"You may not want or even need this one.  As listed, there is only an additional 10 minutes of footage from the first set to this, ""The Definitive Collection"" of ""Father Ted"".  Here is a list of the bonus material:

  * Commentary with Graham Linehan, Arthur Matthews, Ardal O'Hanlon, Tim Shuttlewoode & Chris Claycee
  * Interview with Writers
  * A Christmassy Ted
  * Tedfest 2007 - A Very Ted Weekend
  * Tedfest 2007 - Two Tribes Go To War
  * Comedy Connections
  * Comic Relief with Ted & Dougal
  * Craggy Island Memories
  * Dougal's Sound Effects Gallery
  * Biographies
  * Photo Gallery

The additions to the previous ""Holy Trilogy"" are:
* The 2 ""Tedfest"" featurettes (from a 2007 Father Ted convention)
* A 30-minute episode of the BBC program ""Comedy Connections"" from 2004 detailing the former and subsequent careers of the cast and writers
Craggy Island Memories
* Commentary tracks on the series 3 episodes (of which there were none on the original ""The Holy Trilogy"" - Series 1 and 2 already had commentary tracks by writer Graham Linehan who is joined on the 2nd half of series 2 by actor Ardal O'Hanlon.)
* Dougal's Sound Effects Gallery

While there is nothing left off the original release and the additions add only ""10 minutes"" to the running time (even though they add up to more), these additional features seem to make a double dip unnecessary unless you are a ""Father Ted"" completist.

I purchased the first ""Holy Trilogy"" box set as a blind buy when looking for some new British comedy and was pleasantly suprised.  While it took a few episodes to warm up to the characters, the series quickly grew on me.  It's irreverent humor and situations were a breath of fresh air over more staid approaches to religion in comedy.  At times it has a surreal feel and frequently could easily offend those with little tolerance but I can see Priests in such situations behaving similarly.  After all, they are people too and if you are truly honest about religion you must admit that there are people like these characters in them all.  If you are easily offended you should probably look elsewhere (""The Vicar of Dibley"" is much ""safer"" while still being funny).  If you enjoy irreverent British humor you should give ""Father Ted"" a go.",1201824000,145,2253,4.6923076923076925
3029266,5,B000YIGNKY,"This is an extraordinary show. The only minus is it was only on for three seasons. It is side-splittingly funny. You will be laughing out loud as Father Ted, Father Dougal and Father Jack, along with their housekeeper, Mrs. Doyle, stumble through life, almost demolish Catholicism, reveal the hypocrisy rampant in us all, and make social commentary that is incredibly witty, but is also bitingly accurate! Whether you're just looking for a laugh, or enjoy seeing pompous arse's brought down low, this show is for you. And as an added bonus, the location,the fictional ""Craggy Island"" is one of the most beautiful locations ever! You need this in your collection! And the Yuletide extra, ""A Christmassy Ted"" is worth the price all by itself!",1201305600,52,740,4.975806451612903

3029269,5,B000YIGNKY,"I've missed having a copy of Father Ted. I'm glad I bought another one. It's just as funny as I remember it, and I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys British comedy. There's only one thing I say that was bad about it.
 I had to buy a used copy. Now, I don't mind buying used merchandise, however I only did it because the price that Amazon was asking for was unreasonable.",1515283200,2,385,4.202702702702703

3029271,5,B000YIGNKY,"This show cracks me up!  It's humor causes me big, deep, uncontrollable belly laughs- priceless! -  baffling as to why I'm so tickled by it, I like the Irish accent, the characters simple direct way of putting things, and though I  dislike potty humor, surprisingly I'm not put off or offended by it in this show.  I'm Catholic and find the jokes funny. I first saw Father Ted in France and happy its here on Amazon!",1513123200,3,416,4.434210526315789
3029272,4,B000YIGNKY,"A good collection of a classic show. Certainly there are problematic themes, such as the episode when Father Ted made slanty eyes to mock Asians, or the lecherous memories of Father Jack. And so on. There's no denying that it's insensitive.

That being said, the catch phrases wormed into my ear and won't go. The memorable characters bring me back.",1512604800,,349,4.816666666666666
3029273,5,B000YIGNKY,"In my opinion one of the best TV comedies of all time.  The UK ""IT Crowd"", by one of the same writers, is a close second.  You may have to be Catholic to really appreciate this though.",1512259200,,184,3.945945945945946

3029324,5,B000YIGNKY,"This is brilliant, one of the best British comedies of all time (behind Fawlty Towers, and maybe Black Adder). There is nothing to add, except to point out to those who whine about canned laughter that there isn't any - it was filmed live.  No doubt many of those people like American shows, many of which do have canned laughter (a distraction in ""Seinfeld"", for example). And to the non-readers who buy PAL DVDs and then complain that they won't play on their players - Google ""region hack"", and get someone to read the information to you, or buy a different player.",1470787200,4,568,4.568627450980392

3029328,4,B000YIGNKY,"I was pleased to see this classic UK comedy at a deep discount recently, here at Amazon.ca.

I enjoyed watching this series many years ago with my dear mom, when it first aired on CBC in Canada. And what fun it is to watch it once again. Still lots of LOL moments, original stories and of course an unforgettable cast lead by Dermot Morgan as Fr. Ted.

I'm taking off one star as accessing each episode takes a bit more time than it should, scrolling through the numbers to get to the one you want. Should be set up with quick access to each episode. The graphics on these screens and the ""bunny jump music"" are great fun though. ;-)",1466208000,2,633,4.266666666666667

3029331,5,B000YIGNKY,"A treasured addition to our video library. One of the funniest television programs of all time, featuring a brilliant cast. Where else could one hope to see Father Brian Eno, if only for a few seconds?",1459123200,2,201,4.611111111111111
3029332,4,B000YIGNKY,"If your are not easily offended by slightly raunchy humor at the expense of Catholic priests, you will find this series hilarious.  Set in Ireland, three priests are banished to an out-of-the way parish for misbehavior in their pasts. Their characters are over the top: one is a buffoon, one is a drunk and Father Ted is somewhat ""normal"" but always falling into misadventures.  The sight gags had me laughing until my belly ached.
I bought the series for myself as well as a gift for liberal Catholic friends who got the gags.  They thought it was a hoot.  Rent one first before you buy the whole series to be sure it's to your liking.",1456704000,4,636,4.504347826086956
3029333,5,B000YIGNKY,"From the moment I first saw episode 1 of Father Ted, I knew this was a keeper!  For those who appreciate outrageous humour, slapstick comedy, silly antics, religious spoofing and the shennanigans of 3 unique priests and a housekeeper.  All were banished to an isolated parish outpost on Craggy Island, Ireland.  Brilliant and enjoyable after viewing over and over again!",1455148800,5,370,5.133333333333334

3029346,3,B000YIGNKY,"All in all I didn't care much for this series.  It just seemed to lack class.
All Disc's played perfectly.  No skips no jumps and the sound stayed even.  But wow are these hard to navigate.  I did not realize the sign post was how you changed episodes.  I did like the menu, I spent the whole series looking for the items on the menu.
There are 5 disc's containing 24 episodes and Bonus Features

Episode List:(SPOILER ALERT)

1~""'Good Luck, Father Ted'""
A television program offers to interview Father Ted Crilly. However Ted goes to extreme lengths to ensure the other members of the clergy on the island don't interrupt his moment in the spotlight. Meanwhile Craggy Island hosts Fun Land, a fun fair to which Dougal is desperate to go. Ted takes the film crew to the fair, leading to a massive mess.

2~""Entertaining Father Stone""
Ted and Dougal are devastated as an unbearably boring, yet inoffensive, priest Father Stone arrives on Craggy Island for his annual visit. Ted prays for Father Stone to be taken away, but is later wracked with guilt when Father Stone is struck by lightning.

3~""The Passion of Saint Tibulus""
Bishop Leonard Brennan arrives at the parochial house on an official visit with news that a blasphemous film, condemned by the pope and banned everywhere, is being shown in Craggy Island. He orders them to make a stand and protest at the cinema. Meanwhile Ted and Dougal also reveal new secrets about the Bishop's past.

4~""Competition Time""
With the annual 'All Priests Stars in Their Eyes Lookalike Competition' Father Ted, determined to beat his arch nemesis Father Dick Byrne from Rugged Island, reveals his Elvis costume, only to find that Dougal and Jack have the exact same costume for themselves. Meanwhile, television celebrity Henry Sellers stays at the house.

5~""And God Created Woman""
Father Ted meets novelist Polly Clarke at the book signing for her latest novel Bejeweled with Kisses. Ted then finds out that Polly is renting a cottage across the island as he begins to fall for her, and she invites him for more 'book chat'. Meanwhile Dougal, Mrs. Doyle and Father Jack get in the way of Ted's plans causing disruption.

6~""Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest""
Father Ted is unconcerned when he discovers Jack has drunk a bottle of floor polish, but Sister Monica realizes that a lack of pulse and no breathing can only mean one thing, Father Jack is dead. However, Jack has left some money in his will for Ted and Dougal. But will he stay dead enough for them to get it?

11~""A Song for Europe""
Ted is goaded by Father Dick Byrne into attempting to write a song for ""Eurosong '96"" (spoof of the Eurovision Song Contest). Despite having a song with only one note, Ireland's fear of winning again (and having to fund it) plays into Ted and Dougal's hands. This mirrors the real life belief that Ireland chose the 1994 Eurovision entry, ""Rock 'n' Roll Kids"", which was thought to differ greatly from the typical winning song, so as to ensure they did not have to host the contest again.

17~""A Christmassy Ted"" (60 Minutes)
Ted's quick thinking whilst lost in a department store's lingerie department earns him the coveted Golden Cleric award. So why doesn't he feel happy? Mrs Doyle's attempts to hang up the Christmas decorations become undone around her. She's also none too pleased at her Christmas present. Meanwhile, an ""old friend"" of Ted decides the time is ripe for a visit.

A flight back from a pilgrimage runs out of fuel and there are only two parachutes. Meanwhile Jack discovers a supply of alcohol in the luggage compartment of the plane. Only one man can save the passengers...

It's the show I put on when the kids are asleep, the dishes washed, the snow shovelled and every conceivable duty taken care of or shluffed off one way or another. I don't think I've ever watched Ted before 10 p.m. It's foolishly childish in many places, and many of the jokes are juvenile, but at least you don't see them all coming. Even though it's in no way like Arrested Development, it has that quick pace in its own way, and repeated re-watchings just deepen the fun, as you notice various details -- often it's just the outrageous accents and pronunciations. Great comic timing all over the place and bad production values add to the fun. Of course, some of the episodes are a bit dull, but you can't hit a home run every time. so, hilarious but uneven.

Another relatively minor inconvenience is that the episodes are not printed on the box or the discs. They are only listed on a small sheet of paper that is easy to lose.",1437436800,,453,4.524390243902439

3029489,5,B000YIGNKY,"""Father Ted"" has been around since the 80s, but was a delightful recent discovery for me. The series satirizes life in a typical Roman Catholic rectory in a way that is pointed, but never mean-spirited. Father Ted Crilley is a middle-aged priest, of the hair-over-the-ears variety who joined the Church in its 1960s hippy phase. He dreams of running away with a gorgeous brunette, of becoming a great TV star and of being judged the best priest in Ireland. Not surprisingly, he often trips over his own oversized ego. Father Dougal is the house chimp - a dumb-as-bricks cleric who can't be trusted with a funeral and whose grasp on theology is shaky, to say the least. Father Jack is a demented alcoholic priest of the old persuasion, a former fire-and-brimstone preacher, who sits in the corner chain smoking and cursing. And Mrs. Doyle, the housekeeper, gleefully performs all the household chores (under and on the roof) and frequently can be seen either bringing in the tea or hurtling past the front window.

""Father Ted"" is a throwback to a day when the church, especially the Church in Ireland, was seen as a fairly benign institution. Ah, the good old days.  As a lampoon of small-time Irish life, ""Father Ted"" is priceless. Come, enjoy the village fair, with its ""Spinning Cat"" (a feline on a turntable) and Tunnel of Goats! Enjoy getting Father Jack out of his chair by dangling a bottle of whiskey in front of him! And enjoy Father Ted's latest desperate lies and longing for the limelight.",1357171200,2,1501,4.769230769230769

It's Brilliant!!!,1352160000,,319,4.614035087719298
3029496,5,B000YIGNKY,"Warning, this series is not for everyone.  For those of us who enjoy dry, slapstick, often downright stupid humor...this series could be for you.  I adored Ardal O'Hanlon when he did stand-up and only found this after watching him in the My Hero series.  It does have it's ""okay, is it over yet moments?"" but more often than not it is just plain funny.  I believe that this is one of those series that can be watched time and time again and still be found funny.  This is offered as a region 2 import which means that you will need a dvd player capable of playing European dvds.  If you have purchased The Holy Trilogy you may not need to buy this one for the few added features.  Other recommendations I would make are:  The Vicar of Dibley, My Hero, Mrs. Brown's Boys, Dinner Ladies, On The Up, or Black Books.",1349827200,,812,4.33112582781457
3029497,5,B000YIGNKY,"Well, for those of you who have never seen Father Ted, I say, OMG you have no idea what you're missing!  I discovered the Father Ted shows about a year or so ago, and I am SO hooked!  I've seen each show at least a few times, and still need to get my ""fix"" every few weeks.

I'm not a person who buys shows and watches and rewatches, I just get bored. BUT it's different with Father Ted!!!  I must be their biggest fan. :)
I used to rent them from the local library, but then decided that I couldn't count on them being in when I wanted them every couple weeks, so now I just bought them and I am SO HAPPY!

Father Ted is hilarious!  ANd his sidekick---oops, I mean assistant Priest, Father Dougal, is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  They make the PERFECT pair, and I can't sing enough praise for them.
Mrs. Doyle, their housekeeper, is so wonderful in her role... lol  and of course, Father Jack, who is... well, you'll have to see it to see how he is... lolol

The cast of this show is tremendous.  I wish they had more episodes, but they don't, so I will just keep enjoying what I have :)
They play their roles so perfectly, that
if I met them anywhere else, I would have a hard time accepting they are NOT who they depict on this show!

And for you die-hard Fans of Father Ted, here's something to remember Dougal saying.....  ""HEY!!  We're on a plane!!!""  hahahahahahaha what a guy...  And of course, Father Ted, as they watched The Father Ben episode: ""Oh, yeah, yeah, I know a thicko just like that!!""  LOLOLOL where's his mirror? LOLOL

THank you to all the cast of Father Ted for bringing me so much laughter and fun!!!!!!!!!!!! :)",1346716800,6,1641,4.327868852459017

3029506,5,B000YIGNKY,"Granted, I have not completed the entire series yet, but I am a huge fan of Black Books and the IT Crowd, so I thought I would take a trip back to Graham Linehan's first big success and give it a whirl.

I have to say that I am impressed.  The same dry humor that is rife in Black Books, is here in spades.  The setting is a remote island with not much going on.  The main cast involves a trio of priests and their house keeper.  The first episode is sure to get you hooked.  It really touches on the humor of the show and sets the tone very well.  I love the directions given to a TV show producer on how to locate the island ""just past the nuclear disposal"".  Pretty fun quips like ""do you see a man with a shirt that says 'I shot JR'?"" keep the crowd laughing.

I wouldn't say to dive into this show unless you are a little familiar with British comedy.  For those used to the obvious humor and situations of modern American sitcoms, this could come off as too understated.  But if you love British humor, or have viewed and enjoyed Monty Python, Black Books, or any other good British comedy, then you deserve to watch this treat of a show.  While not quite as funny as Black Books, I have to say I am very pleased with my purchase.

Oh, be sure you are buying the region 1 DVDs if you are in the US.  The amazon.com copies are fine, but be careful with the 3rd party copies.",1323302400,,1379,4.078066914498141

Humorous setting (Craggy Island) and characters (Father Ted, Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle).  Enjoyed learning a few of the Irish terms like ""eejit"".

3029518,5,B000YIGNKY,"Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story.

Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - The Definitive Collection,"" a kooky comedy about a trio of painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity. The series gets progressively weirder as it follows the adventures of the titular character and his drunken and/or idiotic sidekicks, and the cast is absolutely brilliant.

On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.

Over the three seasons, the priests encounter the hostile bishop, a sexy author, a dead-boring houseguest, the worst priest in the world, a trio of bishops, TV hosts, a radical feminist rocker, a slutty milkman, a nervous sheep, and a hardcore nun who could double as an inquisitor.

They have to deal with the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus,"" a plague of rabbits, a costume competition, bishop buttkicking, bomb-carrying milk floats (""Ted, I wanna be a priest again!""), Ted's reputation as a racist, priests lost in the vast lingerie department, an about-to-crash plane full of priests, giving up their vices for Lent, entering a singing competition, raffling a car (which Ted has wrecked), a stolen whistle, a disastrous seaside holiday, an appearance on ""Faith of Our Fathers"" and the apparent death of Father Jack.

Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.

And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!""), hilarious dialogue (""Imagine blowing your head off with a shot-gun. How'd he manage to survive that?"" ""He didn't, Dougal... he died""), and the priests being rather unpriestly (one of them may actually be a monkey disguised as a priest).

Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""FECK! DRINK! GURLS!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.

""Father Ted - The Definitive Collection"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners. But it does make for some very funny comedy.",1278892800,35,3262,5.1647727272727275

3029526,5,B000YIGNKY,"Father Ted is one of the great comedies of the last 20 years. Why? There are a number of reasons for this. The key reason is the underlying truth of the characthers - those of us who are Irish simply know that they are ""real"" - Mrs Doyle: ""Go on have a cup of tea?"" with her insistent hospitality, the warring couple, who keep up appearances in front of the priests and the clueless priests, All this is true social comment on Irish culture where the underlying lunacy or madness in Irish culture is never far from the surface. An interesting issue is to what extent the Celtic Tiger has affected this culture -nothing stands still and there is bound to have been some change since the 90s, particularly with the continuing decline of the Church. We will have to wait and see for the next great comedy on Irish culture - when will that be?",1255651200,,839,4.384615384615385

Some people, particularly religious types, could quiet easily take offense at the portrayal of priests in this manner but it should be noted this was not written for the Politically Correct audience in the US with it's overly sensitive sensibilities.  As such it is fecking hilarious and should be viewed repeatedly, preferably with friends.  Even better watch it with a couple of those sticks in the mud and watch them squirm and tell you how wrong it is, which makes it even funnier.",1247961600,2,730,4.458646616541353

This comedy includes a good array of eccentric characters that keep things fresh and funny.  The writing is very witty and imaginative.  From the interview with the writers,  I gather that they were considering originally making this as a cartoon but that it was cost prohibitive.  The fact that this was written with a cartoon in mind,  and shot as a live action show,  makes it all the more fresh and appealing.  These episodes are funny every time you watch them.

I'll come clean and state that I am of the same opinion as the Salvation Army founder, General Booth, who stated his opinion that God deserves to have joy and humour expressed in his name and that He should not be thought only deserving of dirges and solemnity.

This Series is, in my opinion, a veritable masterpiece of humour. It would be all too easy to concentrate upon the bad language and the occasional crudity, but that would be totally wrong.  There is a universal humour, that shines through this Series and the participants are all joyfully superb. The - completely unique - housekeeper is a real gem. She lights up the TV screen, every time she comes into view. Watch her every move!!

If you've already seen Father Ted, and enjoy it, this is worth the price, and will provide plenty of laughs for you, and the people you know who weren't fortunate enough to stumble upon this on there own.  If you haven't seen this show, well a brief synopsis would be it focuses on three priests (In the looses sense) one a monosyllabic drunkard, another a man child, and the third, the title character, just happens to always be in the wrong place in the wrong time (and is probably an embezzler) and how they really want to just be normal people (which doesn't stop them from using there priest status when it benefits them) on an island of the mainland of Ireland full of people who are the farthest thing from normal.

  * Commentary with Graham Linehan, Arthur Matthews, Ardal O'Hanlon, Tim Shuttlewoode & Chris Claycee
  * Interview with Writers
  * A Christmassy Ted
  * Tedfest 2007 - A Very Ted Weekend
  * Tedfest 2007 - Two Tribes Go To War
  * Comedy Connections
  * Comic Relief with Ted & Dougal
  * Craggy Island Memories
  * Dougal's Sound Effects Gallery
  * Biographies
  * Photo Gallery

The additions to the previous ""Holy Trilogy"" are:
* The 2 ""Tedfest"" featurettes (from a 2007 Father Ted convention)
* A 30-minute episode of the BBC program ""Comedy Connections"" from 2004 detailing the former and subsequent careers of the cast and writers
Craggy Island Memories
* Commentary tracks on the series 3 episodes (of which there were none on the original ""The Holy Trilogy"" - Series 1 and 2 already had commentary tracks by writer Graham Linehan who is joined on the 2nd half of series 2 by actor Ardal O'Hanlon.)
* Dougal's Sound Effects Gallery

While there is nothing left off the original release and the additions add only ""10 minutes"" to the running time (even though they add up to more), these additional features seem to make a double dip unnecessary unless you are a ""Father Ted"" completist.

I purchased the first ""Holy Trilogy"" box set as a blind buy when looking for some new British comedy and was pleasantly suprised.  While it took a few episodes to warm up to the characters, the series quickly grew on me.  It's irreverent humor and situations were a breath of fresh air over more staid approaches to religion in comedy.  At times it has a surreal feel and frequently could easily offend those with little tolerance but I can see Priests in such situations behaving similarly.  After all, they are people too and if you are truly honest about religion you must admit that there are people like these characters in them all.  If you are easily offended you should probably look elsewhere (""The Vicar of Dibley"" is much ""safer"" while still being funny).  If you enjoy irreverent British humor you should give ""Father Ted"" a go.",1201824000,145,2253,4.6923076923076925

I'm Catholic and find the jokes funny. I first saw Father Ted in France and happy its here on Amazon!",1513123200,3,416,4.434210526315789
3263769,4,B000YIGNKY,"A good collection of a classic show. Certainly there are problematic themes, such as the episode when Father Ted made slanty eyes to mock Asians, or the lecherous memories of Father Jack. And so on. There's no denying that it's insensitive.

No doubt many of those people like American shows, many of which do have canned laughter (a distraction in ""Seinfeld"", for example).

I enjoyed watching this series many years ago with my dear mom, when it first aired on CBC in Canada. And what fun it is to watch it once again. Still lots of LOL moments, original stories and of course an unforgettable cast lead by Dermot Morgan as Fr. Ted.

I'm taking off one star as accessing each episode takes a bit more time than it should, scrolling through the numbers to get to the one you want. Should be set up with quick access to each episode. The graphics on these screens and the ""bunny jump music"" are great fun though. ;-)",1466208000,2,633,4.266666666666667

Set in Ireland, three priests are banished to an out-of-the way parish for misbehavior in their pasts. Their characters are over the top: one is a buffoon, one is a drunk and Father Ted is somewhat ""normal"" but always falling into misadventures.  The sight gags had me laughing until my belly ached.

There are 5 disc's containing 24 episodes and Bonus Features

Episode List:(SPOILER ALERT)

1~""'Good Luck, Father Ted'""
A television program offers to interview Father Ted Crilly. However Ted goes to extreme lengths to ensure the other members of the clergy on the island don't interrupt his moment in the spotlight. Meanwhile Craggy Island hosts Fun Land, a fun fair to which Dougal is desperate to go. Ted takes the film crew to the fair, leading to a massive mess.

2~""Entertaining Father Stone""
Ted and Dougal are devastated as an unbearably boring, yet inoffensive, priest Father Stone arrives on Craggy Island for his annual visit. Ted prays for Father Stone to be taken away, but is later wracked with guilt when Father Stone is struck by lightning.

3~""The Passion of Saint Tibulus""
Bishop Leonard Brennan arrives at the parochial house on an official visit with news that a blasphemous film, condemned by the pope and banned everywhere, is being shown in Craggy Island. He orders them to make a stand and protest at the cinema. Meanwhile Ted and Dougal also reveal new secrets about the Bishop's past.

4~""Competition Time""
With the annual 'All Priests Stars in Their Eyes Lookalike Competition' Father Ted, determined to beat his arch nemesis Father Dick Byrne from Rugged Island, reveals his Elvis costume, only to find that Dougal and Jack have the exact same costume for themselves. Meanwhile, television celebrity Henry Sellers stays at the house.

5~""And God Created Woman""
Father Ted meets novelist Polly Clarke at the book signing for her latest novel Bejeweled with Kisses. Ted then finds out that Polly is renting a cottage across the island as he begins to fall for her, and she invites him for more 'book chat'. Meanwhile Dougal, Mrs. Doyle and Father Jack get in the way of Ted's plans causing disruption.

6~""Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest""
Father Ted is unconcerned when he discovers Jack has drunk a bottle of floor polish, but Sister Monica realizes that a lack of pulse and no breathing can only mean one thing, Father Jack is dead. However, Jack has left some money in his will for Ted and Dougal. But will he stay dead enough for them to get it?

Dougal starts hanging around with a rebellious priest, Father Damo Lennon. Meanwhile a valuable whistle is stolen.

11~""A Song for Europe""
Ted is goaded by Father Dick Byrne into attempting to write a song for ""Eurosong '96"" (spoof of the Eurovision Song Contest). Despite having a song with only one note, Ireland's fear of winning again (and having to fund it) plays into Ted and Dougal's hands. This mirrors the real life belief that Ireland chose the 1994 Eurovision entry, ""Rock 'n' Roll Kids"", which was thought to differ greatly from the typical winning song, so as to ensure they did not have to host the contest again.

17~""A Christmassy Ted"" (60 Minutes)
Ted's quick thinking whilst lost in a department store's lingerie department earns him the coveted Golden Cleric award. So why doesn't he feel happy? Mrs Doyle's attempts to hang up the Christmas decorations become undone around her. She's also none too pleased at her Christmas present. Meanwhile, an ""old friend"" of Ted decides the time is ripe for a visit.

A flight back from a pilgrimage runs out of fuel and there are only two parachutes. Meanwhile Jack discovers a supply of alcohol in the luggage compartment of the plane. Only one man can save the passengers...

Ted makes a large bet on the King of the Sheep competition. Unfortunately, Chris, his chosen sheep, has heard rumours about a sheep-eating beast and isn't feeling at all himself.

20~""Speed 3""
When Ted and Dougal expose a philandering milkman, Pat Mustard, he takes revenge on his replacement, Dougal, by putting a bomb on the milk float. If Dougal's speed drops below 4 mph, the bomb will explode, taking Dougal with it...

3263850,1,B000YIGNKY,"I don't get it.  My sister told me this show cracked her up, and I'm a sucker for british comedy, but this show was so juvenile and the jokes fell flat the majority of the time.  The laugh track is so important to have for the vast majority of the jokes, otherwise I wouldn't know the writers were intending to be funny.  Young Ones, Black Adder, Monty Python, even some of the newer gen stuff like Extras and the Office were terrific shows, but this?..... I just don't get it.",1446163200,3,477,4.277777777777778

3263864,5,B000YIGNKY,"Ted is the one I keep coming back to. It's the show I put on when the kids are asleep, the dishes washed, the snow shovelled and every conceivable duty taken care of or shluffed off one way or another. I don't think I've ever watched Ted before 10 p.m. It's foolishly childish in many places, and many of the jokes are juvenile, but at least you don't see them all coming. Even though it's in no way like Arrested Development, it has that quick pace in its own way, and repeated re-watchings just deepen the fun, as you notice various details -- often it's just the outrageous accents and pronunciations. Great comic timing all over the place and bad production values add to the fun. Of course, some of the episodes are a bit dull, but you can't hit a home run every time. so, hilarious but uneven. And five stars.",1441670400,,815,4.368421052631579

3263867,4,B000YIGNKY,"Father Ted is definitely a 5-star series, but I believe that this dvd set leaves a bit to be desired. The video is grainy, at times, resembling '90s broadcast television. The quality varies from episode to episode, with some being better than others. I expected better of a dvd set.

Another relatively minor inconvenience is that the episodes are not printed on the box or the discs. They are only listed on a small sheet of paper that is easy to lose.",1437436800,,453,4.524390243902439

There is no page where it's easy to go from one episode to the next. If you're not watching them all in a row, after watching one episode, you have to click four or five times to get to the next - even more if you want to skip an episode.

3263986,5,B000YIGNKY,"""Father Ted"" has been around since the 80s, but was a delightful recent discovery for me. The series satirizes life in a typical Roman Catholic rectory in a way that is pointed, but never mean-spirited. Father Ted Crilley is a middle-aged priest, of the hair-over-the-ears variety who joined the Church in its 1960s hippy phase. He dreams of running away with a gorgeous brunette, of becoming a great TV star and of being judged the best priest in Ireland. Not surprisingly, he often trips over his own oversized ego. Father Dougal is the house chimp - a dumb-as-bricks cleric who can't be trusted with a funeral and whose grasp on theology is shaky, to say the least. Father Jack is a demented alcoholic priest of the old persuasion, a former fire-and-brimstone preacher, who sits in the corner chain smoking and cursing. And Mrs. Doyle, the housekeeper, gleefully performs all the household chores (under and on the roof) and frequently can be seen either bringing in the tea or hurtling past the front window.

""Father Ted"" is a throwback to a day when the church, especially the Church in Ireland, was seen as a fairly benign institution. Ah, the good old days.  As a lampoon of small-time Irish life, ""Father Ted"" is priceless. Come, enjoy the village fair, with its ""Spinning Cat"" (a feline on a turntable) and Tunnel of Goats! Enjoy getting Father Jack out of his chair by dangling a bottle of whiskey in front of him! And enjoy Father Ted's latest desperate lies and longing for the limelight.",1357171200,2,1501,4.769230769230769

3263989,2,B000YIGNKY,"Unforgivably awful picture and sound quality.  The home-made quality of the recording is inexcusable, and at this price, criminal.  I have to agree with other reviewers that the canned laughter and warped-sounding theme music are really hard to tolerate.  I used to like this program.  What on earth was I thinking?

I adored Ardal O'Hanlon when he did stand-up and only found this after watching him in the My Hero series.  It does have it's ""okay, is it over yet moments?"" but more often than not it is just plain funny.  I believe that this is one of those series that can be watched time and time again and still be found funny.  This is offered as a region 2 import which means that you will need a dvd player capable of playing European dvds.  If you have purchased The Holy Trilogy you may not need to buy this one for the few added features.  Other recommendations I would make are:  The Vicar of Dibley, My Hero, Mrs. Brown's Boys, Dinner Ladies, On The Up, or Black Books.",1349827200,,812,4.33112582781457

I'm not a person who buys shows and watches and rewatches, I just get bored. BUT it's different with Father Ted!!!  I must be their biggest fan. :)
I used to rent them from the local library, but then decided that I couldn't count on them being in when I wanted them every couple weeks, so now I just bought them and I am SO HAPPY!

Father Ted is hilarious!  ANd his sidekick---oops, I mean assistant Priest, Father Dougal, is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  They make the PERFECT pair, and I can't sing enough praise for them.
Mrs. Doyle, their housekeeper, is so wonderful in her role... lol  and of course, Father Jack, who is... well, you'll have to see it to see how he is... lolol

The cast of this show is tremendous.  I wish they had more episodes, but they don't, so I will just keep enjoying what I have :)
They play their roles so perfectly, that
if I met them anywhere else, I would have a hard time accepting they are NOT who they depict on this show!

And for you die-hard Fans of Father Ted, here's something to remember Dougal saying.....  ""HEY!!  We're on a plane!!!""  hahahahahahaha what a guy...  And of course, Father Ted, as they watched The Father Ben episode: ""Oh, yeah, yeah, I know a thicko just like that!!""  LOLOLOL where's his mirror? LOLOL

I have to say that I am impressed.  The same dry humor that is rife in Black Books, is here in spades.  The setting is a remote island with not much going on.  The main cast involves a trio of priests and their house keeper.  The first episode is sure to get you hooked.  It really touches on the humor of the show and sets the tone very well.  I love the directions given to a TV show producer on how to locate the island ""just past the nuclear disposal"".  Pretty fun quips like ""do you see a man with a shirt that says 'I shot JR'?"" keep the crowd laughing.

I wouldn't say to dive into this show unless you are a little familiar with British comedy.  For those used to the obvious humor and situations of modern American sitcoms, this could come off as too understated.  But if you love British humor, or have viewed and enjoyed Monty Python, Black Books, or any other good British comedy, then you deserve to watch this treat of a show.  While not quite as funny as Black Books, I have to say I am very pleased with my purchase.

Oh, be sure you are buying the region 1 DVDs if you are in the US.  The amazon.com copies are fine, but be careful with the 3rd party copies.",1323302400,,1379,4.078066914498141

3264005,4,B000YIGNKY,"Enjoyed the series.  I had never heard of it until an Australian talked about it and said how much his family enjoyed it.  Typical British humor of the Faulty Towers genre.  Very light humor and I did not find it anti-catholic.  I converted to Catholicism about ten years ago and am conservative.  Humorous setting (Craggy Island) and characters (Father Ted, Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle).  Enjoyed learning a few of the Irish terms like ""eejit"".  I am still unsure whether this is an original Irish term or one adopted from the Father Ted series.",1300665600,,546,4.74468085106383

3264015,5,B000YIGNKY,"Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story.

Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - The Definitive Collection,"" a kooky comedy about a trio of painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity. The series gets progressively weirder as it follows the adventures of the titular character and his drunken and/or idiotic sidekicks, and the cast is absolutely brilliant.

On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.

Over the three seasons, the priests encounter the hostile bishop, a sexy author, a dead-boring houseguest, the worst priest in the world, a trio of bishops, TV hosts, a radical feminist rocker, a slutty milkman, a nervous sheep, and a hardcore nun who could double as an inquisitor.

They have to deal with the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus,"" a plague of rabbits, a costume competition, bishop buttkicking, bomb-carrying milk floats (""Ted, I wanna be a priest again!""), Ted's reputation as a racist, priests lost in the vast lingerie department, an about-to-crash plane full of priests, giving up their vices for Lent, entering a singing competition, raffling a car (which Ted has wrecked), a stolen whistle, a disastrous seaside holiday, an appearance on ""Faith of Our Fathers"" and the apparent death of Father Jack.

Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.

And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!""), hilarious dialogue (""Imagine blowing your head off with a shot-gun. How'd he manage to survive that?"" ""He didn't, Dougal... he died""), and the priests being rather unpriestly (one of them may actually be a monkey disguised as a priest).

Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""FECK! DRINK! GURLS!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.

""Father Ted - The Definitive Collection"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners. But it does make for some very funny comedy.",1278892800,35,3262,5.1647727272727275

3264023,5,B000YIGNKY,"Father Ted is one of the great comedies of the last 20 years. Why? There are a number of reasons for this. The key reason is the underlying truth of the characthers - those of us who are Irish simply know that they are ""real"" - Mrs Doyle: ""Go on have a cup of tea?"" with her insistent hospitality, the warring couple, who keep up appearances in front of the priests and the clueless priests, All this is true social comment on Irish culture where the underlying lunacy or madness in Irish culture is never far from the surface. An interesting issue is to what extent the Celtic Tiger has affected this culture -nothing stands still and there is bound to have been some change since the 90s, particularly with the continuing decline of the Church. We will have to wait and see for the next great comedy on Irish culture - when will that be?",1255651200,,839,4.384615384615385

If you have ever seen this show on BBC you know it is a gem which anyone who appreciates immature slapstick humor should explore.  Some people, particularly religious types, could quiet easily take offense at the portrayal of priests in this manner but it should be noted this was not written for the Politically Correct audience in the US with it's overly sensitive sensibilities.  As such it is fecking hilarious and should be viewed repeatedly, preferably with friends.  Even better watch it with a couple of those sticks in the mud and watch them squirm and tell you how wrong it is, which makes it even funnier.",1247961600,2,730,4.458646616541353

3264027,5,B000YIGNKY,"Father Ted is a hilarious Irish comedy about 3 dysfunctional priests banished to a remote island by the church to keep them out of trouble.  This comedy includes a good array of eccentric characters that keep things fresh and funny.  The writing is very witty and imaginative.  From the interview with the writers,  I gather that they were considering originally making this as a cartoon but that it was cost prohibitive.  The fact that this was written with a cartoon in mind,  and shot as a live action show,  makes it all the more fresh and appealing.  These episodes are funny every time you watch them.

Despite the fact that Father Ted was produced by Channel 4, it is an Irish comedy, it is not a British comedy per se. The humour is Irish, the dialogue is of the Irish-English dialect, the writers are Irish, the actors are Irish,it is a parody of Irish Catholic priests! The only reason it may be portrayed as British is because no Irish network could afford to produce it. Please don't refer to it as a ""Brit-Com"".

I also want to point out that, contrary to a few reviews I've read, the laughter on these DVDs is NOT canned; some British/Irish fans have claimed that it was added for USA release, but the writer of the series, in the bonus commentary, says it's the real thing.",1241308800,,475,4.541176470588235

3264032,5,B000YIGNKY,"I'm willing to bet one's appreciation of this product is hugely dependent upon one's view of religion generally - OR one religion in particular.

I'll come clean and state that I am of the same opinion as the Salvation Army founder, General Booth, who stated his opinion that God deserves to have joy and humour expressed in his name and that He should not be thought only deserving of dirges and solemnity.

This Series is, in my opinion, a veritable masterpiece of humour. It would be all too easy to concentrate upon the bad language and the occasional crudity, but that would be totally wrong.  There is a universal humour, that shines through this Series and the participants are all joyfully superb. The - completely unique - housekeeper is a real gem. She lights up the TV screen, every time she comes into view. Watch her every move!!

This show will shock the puritanical, but amaze and delight the average person. Personally, I can't get enough of this brilliant and totally outrageous show. I'd give it 6 stars for humour, without doubt!",1231286400,10,1048,4.741758241758242
