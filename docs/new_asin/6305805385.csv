7895135,5,6305805385,"i enjoyed all of these episodes, my favorite was ''Biyomon gets firepower'' of course since Biyomon was my first favorite Digimon.

i think it's hard to compare this and pokemon, since they are alot different in their own rights(i pretty much have studied each quite extensively for online text based rpgs back when this was still aired and still keep up with pokemon but not so detailed of the newer digimon seasons).

i would highly recommend this video to any diehard digimon fan who has a VCR(even if they don't like the newer seasons much or at all). i only have good memories of this, other then the pang of disapointment when they changed the main characters the next two seasons of this and i lost interest in the show(i prefer to see my favorite characters in new stories over new characters following simular/same plotlines but that's a taste issue).",1305417600,,860,4.726666666666667
7895136,5,6305805385,"It is nice to have a place where you can still purchase VHS tapes.  My son likes digimon and only uses VHS, so it is a win-win.",1297296000,,127,3.7037037037037037
7895137,5,6305805385,I got this vidieo and oh my gosh it is one of the best shows ever.  I used to like pokemon but now I have come to my senses what the heck pokemon are the gayest and dumbest things ever 8 P if you like pokemoon come to you're  senses digimon is so much better than pokemon. Digimon could just go boo  and the pokemon would run away screaming.,956534400,6,341,3.9130434782608696
7895138,4,6305805385,Still lost.  The good things about this video is the Black Gears are introduced and the really cool part in the factory.,954028800,,120,4.454545454545454
7895139,3,6305805385,"Okay, I think that this Anime is very good, dubbing, and Raw.. The Theme Songs are both Very Catchy, Di DiGi Digimon Digital Monsters, Fly on my Love.. I'm wondering why the heck the Japanese Digimon theme is a Love  Song! I think the Shinka (Digivolving) is getting a little hand thou,  because why should they be going more and more up? I liked it better when  they went only to the Champion Level. The New DigiDestined, Inoue Miyako,  Hida Iori, Daisuke Motomiya, and Satoru Iscchihgo (However you spell it,  and he's an evil DigiDestined) Change there forms in the Digiworld, I think  that the old DigiDestined were Better (Hikari and Takeru will be in this  season). ~Miyako",953337600,,679,4.703389830508475
7895140,5,6305805385,"How can Anime go wrong when drawn by the creators of the 2 most famous animes? (Dragonball, and Z; Sailormoon) These episodes are Kabuterimon's Electroshocker (also known as the Andromon ep) the Togemon in Toy town ep  (one of my very favorites) and I'm not sure, but the 3rd might be the  Yokomon village one! That one was a must see for Sora lovers. And that's  it! If you bought the first volume, you got the gold lined digimon cards  that you can't find anywhere else.  Who knows what  (or if) the suprise is  this time! In my very highly rated opinion (egoalert) this is a must buy.",953337600,4,587,4.37962962962963
