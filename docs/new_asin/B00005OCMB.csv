7948637,1,B00005OCMB,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

This is Ultimate Wrestling- Jeff Jarrett In Your Face
I went into a certain department store and it just so turned out they had a bunch of DVDs they were giving away for free. This was the only wrestling DVD they had, so I picked it up. There are 5 matches on this DVD, and none of them are great. It is nice to see Jarrett in his early career though. I want to say this takes place at WCCW, USWA, or some place called Renegades Rampage. I am not sure. The commentary is hard to hear, but didn't effect my viewing that much. Also, it's funny to look back and see that Jeff was a good guy once.

Jeff Jarrett VS Beast
Beast looks a lot like Kamala. I don't think he is though, just a rip-off. This match only lasts a few minutes before a skinny Cactus Jack and someone else interferes. What you get to see is nice though.
RATING- 4/10

Jeff Jarrett VS Ronnie P. Gossett
Ronnie is actually a manager. The match is pretty short and doesn't have much action. Still, it is fun to watch Jarrett beat up this mouthpiece.
RATING- 4/10

Jeff Jarrett VS Jeff Gaylord
Gaylord seems to focus on taunting the crowd most of the time. It makes for a very boring match.
RATING- 2/10

Guitar on a Pole Match
Jeff Jarrett VS Billy Joe Travis
Jerry Lawler is on commentary for this match. I enjoyed this match a lot. Jarrett is a house of fire and attacks Travis on the outside. He even slams Travis on the floor a couple of time. There is use of a chair at one point. Jarrett even delivers a brutal DDT on Travis into the announce table. There is a lot of interference after the match though.
RATING- 7.5/10

Heavyweight Championship
Jerry Lawler(c) VS Jeff Jarrett
This match is just flat out bad. Lawler dominates Jarrett by continually uses a chain wrapped around his fist. That is the entire match in a nutshell. Jarrett eventually gets use of the chain and wins the match. The decision is however thrown out because the referee saw the chain in Jarrett's hand. There is a ton of interference afterward, you will think you are watching an episode of TNA iMPACT there is so much interference.
RATING- 2.5/10

7948638,3,B00005OCMB,"Long before he achieved worldwide fame in the WWF as ""Double J,"" long before making his mark in history as the WCW World Heavyweight champion as ""The Chosen One,"" ""Simply Irresistible"" Jeff Jarrett was a hot rookie cruiserweight in the legendary WCCW/USWA promotion based out of Dallas, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee.  This bargain priced DVD chronicles 5 of his matches out of his rookie years in the USWA, circa 1989 - 1990.
Here are the contents of this DVD:
THE MATCHES
1. Jeff Jarrett vs. the Botswana Beat (w/ General Skandor Akbar):  The Beast was basically a Kamala clone (big fat African headhunter type).  The match itself was not much - tons of stalling with a few spots.  However, the crowd was hot for it.  Match time:  about 4 mins.  Post-match run-ins by Cactus Jack and ""Gorgeous"" Gary Young.  2 stars
2. Jeff Jarrett vs. Ronnie P. Gossett:  Gossett (an oversized ""Boss Hoag from Dukes of Hazzard) was a manager in the area at the time whose stable Jarrett was feuding with.  Again, not much of a match, but the fans loved seeing ""Porky"" get his.  Post-match run-ins by his stable of ""The Dirty White Boys"" (Tony Anthony and Tom Burton)  Percy Pringle (Paul Bearer) was on commentary.  2 minute match, 5 minute segment.  1  stars.
3. Jeff Jarrett vs. ""Missouri Tiger"" Jeff Gaylord (w/ Akbar):  Gaylord was a mid-carder in WCCW/USWA in this era, not much else afterward.  Decent match.  5 minutes.  3 stars.
4. Jeff Jarrett vs. Billy Joe Travis in the Guitar on the Pole Match:  Jerry Lawler was on commentary.  Travis, like Jarrett would in the WWF, had a country musician gimmick.  Thus this match.  GREAT action that sprawled across the ring and around the ringside area.  Post-match antics saw Lawler and Kerry Von Erich (the late legendary Texas wrestling hero of the famed Von Erich family) get involved.  5 minutes.  4 stars.
5. Jeff Jarrett tribute video set to Tina Turner's ""Simply The Best.""
6. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler tribute video which leads us to the main event...
7. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler (champ) w/ Ronnie P. Gossett vs. ""Simply Irresistible"" Jeff Jarrett for the USWA Unified Heavyweight Championship:  Long before becoming everyone's favorite perverted WWF color commentator, Lawler was the ""King"" of Memphis wrestling, a true legend and a great champion.  Typical Lawler ""heel"" mode match with TONS of stalling and trash-talking.  Match was not a scientific classic, but a great study in heel psychology with Lawler resorting to every under-handed method known to man.  Match lasted about 10 minutes.  All-star post-match run-ins by Bill Dundee, the Dirty White Boys and Billy Joe Travis.  3  stars
THE DVD Extras
The extras on the DVD are somewhat laughable.  Included on this DVD (and the other 4 in this series) are:
1. A slide show of stills from various matches in this series.
2. A trivia quiz on Jarrett and the matches featured on this DVD.
In other words, the extras are all right for a look but otherwise are throwaways...
THE VERDICT:
Overall, at the cover price this DVD is actually quite the bargain.  The matches and extras are a little sparse, but they are golden for wrestling nostalgists.  The matches themselves, while not great, are passable entertainment.
This DVD is definitely must viewing for Jarrett fans/enthusiasts/completists.  Fans of the WCCW/USWA circa `89/'90 will also appreciate this DVD.
This is definitely a rental if you are looking strictly for the action.  The action is non-existent (first two matches) to passable (the latter 3 matches) but not a must-see.  The true value in this is for collectors, particularly Jarrett fans or USWA fans.  It's a great look at the genesis of the career of one of Sports Entertainment's top stars.
Recommended for Jarrett/USWA fans.

7948639,2,B00005OCMB,"Jeff Jarrett was a young guy who had superstar written all over him.  Unfortunately, WWF/WCW politics ruined a pretty solid career.  But for those of us who remember, there is this DVD - Jeff Jarrett: In Your Face.  Part of a set of WCCW/CWA/USWA DVDs recently released from Madacy.
This may be worth the price just to see early Jarrett, who is the spitting image of Jeff Spicolli in Fastimes at Ridgemont High.
Jeff Jarrett vs. Beast - Eh.  Just a showcase for a young Jarrett who is in a new territory.
Jeff Jarrett vs. Ronnie P. Gossett - See above.  That's about as jobberish as a jobber name gets.
Jeff Jarrett vs. Jeff Gaylord - Gaylord did okay when he was in WCCW, but when he jumped to the WWF it was clear he was out of his league.  Jarrett shows nice storytelling sense, but his offense is non-existent compared today's wrestling.
Jeff Jarrett vs. Billy Joe Travis - I take that Ronnie P. Gossett joke back.  THIS is the most jobberish of jobber names.  Lawler is on commentary setting up a feud between the CWA and WCCW/USWA.
Jeff Jarrett vs. Jerry Lawler - Lawler is a master of psychology.  Jarrett is just coming into his own at this point.  The only real reason to get the DVD.
In the End:  If you can find the Lawler/Jarrett match anywhere else, do so.  This is hardly a best-of.  Recommendation to avoid all but Lawler/Jarrett.",1018483200,,1345,4.463114754098361
