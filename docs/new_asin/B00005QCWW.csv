1648135,3,B00005QCWW,"A major caveat for purchasers:
These ""shutter glasses"" 3D movies will only work on older cathode ray televisions.
They will not work at all with modern Flat-screen televisions.

If you have an old cathode ray television - you will enjoy these films.
If you do not, you will be seriously disappointed.",1259798400,5,300,4.882352941176471
1648136,3,B00005QCWW,"I purchased this DVD as I was around when the 3D movies came out in the 50's.  My question is how do you view in 3D?  There were no glasses included.  I tried some of my old cardboard - red/green, red/blue and polarized from other 3D titles but they didn't work.",1233878400,2,262,4.098039215686274
1648137,4,B00005QCWW,"If you want some cool 3D effects, this is the movie. Not much plot but still a good time",1233619200,,88,3.6842105263157894
1648138,4,B00005QCWW,"First of all, even if the movie is available in 2d and 3d...hum...this is

definitively a 3d movie experience.. worth 4 stars  and only 2 stars if

you watch it in 2d. So get your special flicker glases and enjoys those

things that like to come out from your tv.",1162512000,,263,4.2
1648139,5,B00005QCWW,"""Haunted Castle"" and ""Alien Adventure"" are great, but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" makes it better than the other two.  The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in, other than the entire movie itself.  I do wish the mine ride was longer though (the one which ends with the big, round, stone ball slamming into the tunnel) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience.  Sure, the Jules Verne ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" ride certainly makes up for it, but the effects in the shorter example were awesome, like the bats.  Best of all, the film doesn't look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production.  Now I've definitely got to get the sequel ""Misadventures in 3D"" DVD.  Noticed something stupid in the credits for ""Encounter"".  Instead of saying ""Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", it redundantly reads, ""Elvira as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"".  Unlike the other 3D IMAX films, this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise.  Of course, the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway.  I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors.",1134000000,15,1210,4.586046511627907
1648140,1,B00005QCWW,"The obvious attitude of the producers of this mess was clearly one of superiority.  I mean, ""After all, we're shooting in IMAX 3D instead of the nefarious over/under format!""  Well, whoopdeedoo!  I'll take THE BUBBLE, METALSTORM, or AMITYVILLE 3D any day over this.  There is some nice computer graphics work here, but there's really no story to speak of.  And their so-called ""history of 3D presentation"" is superficial at best.  While surely impressive in Imax, ENCOUNTER looks stupid on your TV screen 'cause everything is covered in a long shot or a medium long shot.  Yes, that may work on the giant behemoth Imax screen, but reduce it in size to your TV (even my big 36-inch JVC) and it's pretty unimpressive.  Not only that, but if you're watching it in alternating-field 3D with liquid crystal glasses, then you're watching it in half the normal resolution you normally see on your NTSC screen -- so there's next to NO picture detail.  If you want a good 3D DVD movie, search the web for one of the alternating field DVD's of something like IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, HOUSE OF WAX, or DIAL M FOR MURDER (sadly only available in 3D via pirated editions because the US distributors don't care enough to bother -- so were only left with legit DVD's of crap like ENCOUNTERS and amatuer videos of murderous clowns on the rampage).  I would have given this two stars because it features (very briefly) Cassandra ""Elvira"" Peterson -- BUT THEY COVERED HER ONLY IN LONG SHOT TOO!  They were REALLY stooopid, so they get one star.  Boo!",1065139200,11,1533,4.67910447761194
1648141,4,B00005QCWW,"This video uses the style of Mystery Science Theater, in that your host interacts with a smart-aleck computer/robot. Elvira makes a guest appearance, but the flaws come in where examples of films shot in 3D are shown; there are wonderful examples of 3D films, i.e., the Creature Of The Black Lagoon, the 3 Stooges,
House of Wax.
Instead, we get Top Banana for goodness' sake.",1003968000,11,375,4.7846153846153845
1648151,2,B00005QCWW,Just not very good.  Very short and notchy.  Maybe fair for the younger set. A lot of money spent for little results.,1385424000,,117,4.2727272727272725
1648152,1,B00005QCWW,I saw this program on my 3D TV and was very impressed with the quality.  However the DVD is not compatible and won't play om our BluRay system.  The cost to return the DVD was more than the cost of the DVD so we were out the cost.  Don't buy this if you want it for 3D TV!,1372377600,,272,3.6551724137931036
1648153,1,B00005QCWW,"This feature is 36 minutes long with about 20 minutes of extras. Elvira is on screen for only a few minutes, part of which is to lip sync a song. Stuart Pankin plays a professor of 3D technology and gives us a brief and bumbling history of 3D then shows some cuts from old films. Unless you own an IMAX theater in your home, the effect is lost and so is the film. Like so many early IMAX films, it was created to promote IMAX and not tell a story.

The film is kid friendly who may be the only ones who can enjoy it. It has Elvira on the cover so mammalian fetish idiots like me would buy it.",1363305600,,592,3.933333333333333

1648155,1,B00005QCWW,"I absolutely love Elvira, but this is just plain stupid, she only shows up for bits and pieces. The whole premise of this is ridiculous. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1343001600,,161,4.4
1648156,1,B00005QCWW,"I should have known by the low price but this is a low rent production that's designed for large format and in crummy 1:33 and not even in a form of 3D I know of.  I expected an anaglyph presentation but it's not!  It's some long forgotten format you won't be able to use.
The description gives you the impression you will see lots of film clips.  You don't.  Just a few very quick snippets of films in one part of the film.  The rest is all corny padding.  This one is ready for the trash!",1328486400,,490,4.052083333333333

1648158,1,B00005QCWW,"Becareful when purchasing this 3D movie.  It is not compatible with the latest 3D technology.  Being new to the 3D experience, I was not aware of the difference so was terribly disappointed when I could not get this movie to play.  I was expecting an experince akin to ""Misadventures in 3D"" not knowing that this movie employs the earlier technology as do many of the 3D movies which are available for purchase.",1315872000,2,411,4.680555555555555

7950363,5,B00005QCWW,"Excellent film, and it DOES play in 3D. It was made for an older system that predates 3D TVs, which was a $100 box that you connect to your CRT TV that enables the 3D playback of titles like this, which you view with shutterglasses.
