I purchased this for my sister for Christmas and was unsure what the translation would be like since it's much cheaper than the other DVDs on amazon, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has very few spelling errors in the translation. Would highly recommend.",1388620800,,401,4.826086956521739
8618406,5,B00FRUSCU8,"The subtitles to this movie were really great.  The only down-side I had to this boxed set was the lack of sub-titles for the songs, which would have been great.  Also, the ending song (which I was able to find on the internet with subtitles) was very beautiful in what it was saying and in the beauty of the music and voice.  It was really disappointing that the producers of this movie couldn't have provided the sub-titles to that ending song, as it adds a great deal to the understanding of what the singer was saying to the lady he loved.  Still, a beautiful movie and I have replayed it at least three times since my original viewing.  Great plot and the actors were too funny.",1386288000,2,683,4.388888888888889
