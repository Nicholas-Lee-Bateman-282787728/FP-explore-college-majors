The script needs a lot of work, the acting was inadequate(not actors/actesses), the music they played was down-played hip hop for a christian movie. And the one-tune song they played thru out the movie was getting on my nerves.

The scenes were badly written and acted. It was boring until about 35 mins in when it got funny for about 15 mins. then it went back to crazy.  The scenes did not flow into each other. They just made a scene, cut, then another scene, cut (black screen), all thru movie.

Dinner:  FIXING dinner for guest with bread from the garbage can. WOW.  It was dumb in many parts of the movie.
One funny scene:  homeless as pastor at dinner said, he went to cementery school, not seminary school.

But that was not enough for the price of movie and s/h. I  am totally disappointed with this movie and it is a big let down. I would not look at it again unless I'm really bored.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  These movie companies need to stop making these 'DUMB BLACK MOVIES' and think that this is what we like or what we are all about or act like.  This is not a good christian movie and I've purchased so many like this, it makes me angry.

That is NOT US, and the characterization is demoralzing.",1316304000,,1289,4.369747899159663
