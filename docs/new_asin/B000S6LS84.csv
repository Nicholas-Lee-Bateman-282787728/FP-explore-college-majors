2881576,5,B000S6LS84,"Powerful and Provocative!  This captivating film unveils the raw truth behind the diamond trade in Sierra Leone which elicits an eye-opening emotion that leaves some of hip-hop's most iconic figures shocked and saddened. After seeing Bling, you'll never think about diamonds in the same way ever again.  I commend filmmaker Raquel Cepeda for giving the people of Sierra Leone an opportunity to share their stories to the world and for making those voices count.",1191283200,3,461,5.216216216216216
2881577,5,B000S6LS84,"If you don't own it, you should. I saw this amazing film at BAM in Brooklyn and I hope it gets wide release and exposure. It can really be used to educate the uninformed about some of the consequences of buying diamonds. Cepeda's film is both insightful and provocative in the way it exposes the links between hip hop culture and the devastating aspects of the diamond trade on the land and people of war torn Sierra Leone. Cepeda is able to creatively weave the stories of hip hop artists with those of the victims of the war; child soldiers, amputees, rape victims and the displaced.  Watching the gradual understanding awaken in the minds of the hip hop artists Cepeda traveled to Africa alongside the gripping homecoming of a former child soldier is moving.",1190160000,2,761,4.67910447761194
2881578,5,B000S6LS84,"1st of all I haven't seen this film but I've read a lot of great things about it and I plan to purchase it soon.

Now, I have to say I'm tired of Hip Hop getting the blame for all these issues that have existed before Hip Hop was even mainstream. I mean ""BLING"" has been around long before Hip Hop, just check any married women's finger HELLO!!!

BLING-BLING has been around years before the song was made by The Hot Boyz.

Liberace was BLINGING way before Hip Hop (LOL!!!)

The term is a reflection of what's been going on ears, fingers and necks for as long as I can remember.

2nd most of these so called rappers don't even own REAL DIAMONDS people so relax! Who you need to be worried about are the Gate's and Trump types who actually have the money to buy all these diamonds.

I hope this movie also addresses the Diamond Companies who pay these African Armies to enslave people to dig these diamonds and kill Tribes to move them off lands where the mines are. These companies should be prosecuted and taking down by the U.S. or U.N. or whoever has the authority to do so.

And last Diamonds aren't the only thing Africans are being enslaved and killed for.

Rwandans are slaughtering one another to corner the market on the colombite-tantalite-laced mud (known as coltan) that keeps your cell phone ringing. (For more on this, see Black Brit artist Steve McQueen's upcoming exhibition Gravesend.)

Peace...",1189987200,,1412,4.549407114624506
2881579,5,B000S6LS84,"A powerful film!  The film calls on the hip-hop industry and America to take a hard look at the consequences of a society that values ""Bling"". It's an emotional, eye opening journey; especially for the 3 artists and 1 former child solder traveling to Sierra Leone. I highly recommend the film for a mature, worldly audience. The film is also an excellent educational tool for young adults.  Despite some gruesome footage of the atrocities suffered by the people of Sierra Leone; it's full of hope for their healing process and uplifts the viewer with a witty sense of humor. The synopsis on the history of hip-hop and its increasing allure of diamonds is a nice added bonus.",1189900800,3,674,4.752136752136752
2881580,5,B000S6LS84,"This film made my jaw drop. It made my heart hurt. It made me want to get up out of my seat and do something. It made me want to show it to everyone I know. While the version shown on VH1 may have been eye-opening for primetime TV, the DVD version is the one you need to watch. Don't miss it.",1189641600,,292,3.725806451612903
2881581,5,B000S6LS84,"I caught this screening at the Tribeca Grand Hotel in NYC in July. Let me say that this is a truly amazing piece of work by Cepeda. There is such a brutal honesty in her work that I personally feel is missing in the documentary genre lately...Her juxtaposition of conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone to hip-hop culture, is graphic on both sides of the hemisphere. It is simply not sugar-coated and succeeds in what many docs don't - raise a discussion...in the BLING's case a cultural critique on popular culture and it's undeniable connection to capitalism, corruption and consumption. Trust me this film will stir a lot of emotions and anyone who appreciates hip-hop should see it.",1189555200,,681,4.829059829059829
2881582,5,B000S6LS84,"I saw Bling at BAM at the end of March and it totally blew me away. First off, the room was filled to capacity--so much so--that folks were sitting on the floor on the aisle. I had seen the vh1 version and heard Cepeda's cut was different. Boy, was it. The man sitting next to me was crying throughout the film. And there were funny moments as well. I can't say enough about this work. I remember when Cepeda was helming Oneworld magazine and this doc truly takes her global vision to a whole other level. Bravo!",1189382400,3,512,4.288659793814433
2881603,5,B000S6LS84,"To say that Bling is a powerful film is a huge understatement. I wish all Americans would see it. I keep up with the news and consider myself well informed on current events. I took particular interest in Sierra Leone during the war, and still, I learned so much from this film. It's a fascinating perspective through which to tell the stories of this unimaginable tragedy. I watched the film on netflix, sitting on my couch. I could have easily paused at any time, but I didn't. Not once. By the time I finished watching the film, I had to pee so bad...I was so engrossed in the movie that I couldn't even bring myself to pause it to pee. That's pretty much the best praise a film can get from me. So yeah, I loved it.",1361318400,,719,4.255474452554744
2881604,2,B000S6LS84,"This is an okay look at the diamond trade and the impacts of the industry on Sierra Leone, but I wanted to see more of the former child soldier, Ishmel. There was so much potential to teach the Hip-Hop community about the need for reformation and aid in the area. I felt the only times when the artists felt interested in the area  was when they saw the port where SL's slave trade took place; their emotions had more to do with their ancestors than the men and women in front of them. They often came across as selfish and immature. I was disappointed to see them wearing their ""bling"" in front of the men literally slaving away in the mines. I also wanted to see how they followed up. Most seemed affected at some point during the film, but there was no commitment to improving the region's squalid conditions. An uplifting documentary about African culture, life, and resilience (not about conflict diamonds though) that far outdoes this piece is entitled ""Pray The Devil Back To Hell"" about the reign of Charles Taylor in Liberia.",1361059200,2,1034,4.589189189189189
2881605,3,B000S6LS84,probably won't change the world but interesting look at the diamond trade business. it was ok. i won't discourage other from seeing it but i won't be recommending that anyone rush and put it in their wishlist either.,1360713600,,216,4.7105263157894735
2881606,4,B000S6LS84,"After seeing all the five star reviews I decided to give this a watch. The footage is powerful and impactful. When the focus was on the former child-soldier, Ishmael Beah, you are left feeling a sense of ""western-guilt"". This kid tells these horrific stories of death, chaos, and greed, then brings a smile to his face, because of the gratefulness he feels for being alive. The focus of the documentary should have rested more on his storyline. At the very least, there should have been more conversation between Ishmael and the musicians about the potential they have to change the attitudes towards diamonds. The musicians that traveled with him to Sierra Leone came across as shallow and selfish, only superficially impacted by the horrors being presented to them. The film ends and you have this uneasy sense that these musicians are going to return to the United States and leave the misery behind.",1328400000,5,903,4.908496732026144
2881607,5,B000S6LS84,"If you love hip hop, or you love Sierra Leone, or BOTH, you NEED to see this.  Your children need to see this.  The perfect sort of documentary for this hip hop generation.  A great gift for a young, teen-aged Black male.",1295308800,,221,4.214285714285714
2881608,5,B000S6LS84,"Good impression of Sierra Leone post-war. I like the way they they connected the Bling from the Hip-hop industry with the suffering of the people from Sierra Leone.

Must see, if you want to know more about blood diamonds en the story behind it.

2881609,5,B000S6LS84,"I ordered this movie for my students to learn a little bit more about the diamond trading and wars in Sierra Leone prior to reading the novel, ""A Long Way Gone"". The students LOVED this movie and were locked in from the first to last second. Great, eye opening documentary!",1248048000,,273,4.48
2881610,5,B000S6LS84,"I'm so thankful this documentary has been released on DVD because I missed the original VH1 airing in early 2007. Both sustantive and stylish, this documentary is a must for:

1) any lover of hip-hop/rap music and culture
2) anyone who has ever questioned the value or relevance of hip-hop/rap music
3) anyone who has read Ishmael Beah's riveting memoir, A Long Time Gone
4) anyone who seeks greater awareness for our global community
5) anyone who has a desire to LEARN

I finished this documentary with an even greater respect for the artists who made the trip to Africa than I had before. Their willingness to travel to Sierra Leone was the ultimate illustration of ""realness"" and ""respect."" Definitely, I plan to utilize this documentary in my courses this fall.",1219449600,,766,4.8396946564885495
2881611,5,B000S6LS84,I used this DVD after a curriculum on Blood Diamonds in Sierra Leone. My students were very engaged. Some parts had to be edited because of language.,1208563200,,149,4.555555555555555
2881612,5,B000S6LS84,"Raquel Cepeda is a brilliant writer and film maker.  I have been a fan of her work for seven years.  Bling is one of my favorite films of 2007.  I've seen the film a total of four times and every time I've viewed it I learn and discover new and profound truths.

8204430,5,B000S6LS84,"This video is a companion piece for teaching A Long Way Gone.  Though I am not into hip-hop culture, the artists in the documentary are interesting to students and the film shows the grim reality of the diamond trade's impact in Sierra Leone.  I wouldn't sit and watch this on a Friday night at home, but as a teacher, I find it a useful resource to engage students and talk about world issues.",1472342400,,394,4.383561643835616
8204431,5,B000S6LS84,"Such a great film. Brilliant, really. To reduce it to being about the hip hop industry, or about child soldiers, or about the diamond industry and exploitation, or any one of these things is to take away the large, ineffable truth at the intersection of all of it. This dynamic documentary underscores the interconnectedness of people under the auspices of different nations but influenced by the economics of pop culture on a global scale. Child soldiers wear Tupac t-shirts as the uniform of their fight, diamond mine workers mine for ""bling"" coveted by hip hop & rap stars, refugees struggle to live, it's all there, knocking into each other in a mess of commerce and war. Easy to watch, engaging and human, dramatic in its insights and delivery, it's fantastic.",1470182400,,765,4.892307692307693

8204437,2,B000S6LS84,"I like the idea behind this, but they should have equipped the poor guys with some education before dropping them in Africa. They embarrassed themselves and Americans in general with their ignorance of the history, politics, and economics of the area. While this shed light on some very sad things and personal experiences of a few Africans effected by past wars and diamond mining in the area, it missed the mark.
