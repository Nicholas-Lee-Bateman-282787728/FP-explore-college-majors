4383969,5,B000PUCMAG,This is another great video in the Core Secrets series.  I like that it only takes about 20 minutes and it definately focused on the targeted area.,1274918400,,147,4.444444444444445
4383970,5,B000PUCMAG,You may not think that you were working your buns and legs that hard while you are doing the video but wait till the next day I felt the burn for like three days after I did this video the first time. After I lost nearly 100 lbs. I need to tone up I'm already feeling the difference. Great exercise program.,1257292800,5,307,4.049180327868853
4383971,5,B000PUCMAG,Love this work out from all of his core secrets DVD. You will see result if you do it 3x a week and keep to it. using the Ball makes it feel more like a cardio work as you are toning your body. You will feel it the next day and lose inch too!.,1247356800,,243,3.5185185185185186
4383972,3,B000PUCMAG,"This is a good tape for beginners or intermediates, but unless you want to go out and buy leg weights, you will grow out of this video.
But it's a good all-around little bit of everything on the ball workout",1236297600,,207,4.2
4383973,5,B000PUCMAG,"Like all of the Core Secret products, this one is great.  I've been doing Gunnar's workouts for 3 years now and it has been the one program that I can stick with and still enjoy.  I am 52 yrs old with disc and joint problems, but I can do this.  I have all the DVDs and enjoy the variety.  Some are 20 mins, some 45 mins so I can tailor my program as time allows and the variety keeps me motivated.  I lost 50 pounds with this exercise and minor diet changes.  Most importantly I gained energy, strength and flexability.  The best part of Gunnar's approach is that you can start from ground zero, adjust and pace yourself.  As I progressed I began to use the spaces in the video where he explains the next moves to just keep working. I love this program--perfect for anyone who wants to overcome their hatred of exercise.",1228953600,6,821,4.285714285714286
4383974,5,B000PUCMAG,"Funny, how you read reviews of people enjoying exercise workout dvds and no one seems patient enough to try to product long enough to then write a review and come on here and tell you what kind of results they recieved by sticking witht the program.  Behold!:  This is a good workout for the glutes.  I've been doing this dvd for a number of months.  And it does get results if you keep with it and do it no less than 3 times a week.  And it would aid as well if you can work in cardio 3-5 times a week too, to help shed fat and help lift those buns; as this dvd is not a cardio workout.  If your husband/boyfriend tells you he sees results from you working it so hard, it's a good dvd.  Gunnar breaks down the moves for you before he has you begin so that you can get grips on what to do.  It runs about 20 minutes which includes the warm up and cool down sessions.  As you feel you can do it and have done the dvd a number of times, to help amp the workout you get out of this dvd, is that when Gunnar is explaining how to do the moves, at that time you can be already doing the move to get in some extra reps.  You can also add ankle weights to eventually gain more dramatic results.  Besides the helps I've listed, for optimum results: ditch the junk food as much as possible!!  Think to yourself, ""Do I want this junk in my trunk?"", and if not DON'T EAT IT!  Good luck!!
I have a number of Gunnar Peterson's dvd's and the ones I've been able to do over the past couple years have been great!  I recommend all of them.",1197417600,26,1522,3.98019801980198
4383975,5,B000PUCMAG,"I just finished this Core Secrets: FUNdamentals program for the first time and I am very impressed with it! I got this as part of the workout offered by Core secrets that has this workout along with ""Give Me Twenty"" (I actually purchased it via amazon marketplace). I wanted to review this specific program by itself while it was fresh in my mind.

The program starts with an introduction with Gunnar Peterson and Brooke Burke. They go over some basic things you need to know regarding the ball and what to expect from the upcoming workout. On the DVD this is chaptered separately from the main workout so that you don't need to watch the intro each time or have to forward through it.

The workout is made up of a warm up, 10 exercises (which cover the whole body from head to toe), and a short cool down.

The exercises in the main workout are:

1. Squat (holding the ball in front of you)
2. Triceps Extension (both arms at the same time while seated on the ball)
3. Shoulder Press (seated on the ball)
4. Crunch (lying across the ball)
5. Hamstring Press (lying on your back with you feet on the ball, you raise yourself up into a bridge position)
6. Seated Back Extension (seated on the ball, you bend over and then raise up using the back muscles).
7. Bent Over Rows (Seated on the ball)
8. Biceps Curls (seated on the ball)
9. Pushup (with your torso or legs on the ball depending on your level of strength)
10. Drape (you lie prone over the ball, very nice release)

Each exercise is first demonstrated by Brooke with Gunnar and Brooke giving you tips on proper form (each exercise is also chaptered separately).

I am an advanced exerciser (though still relatively new to stability ball work) and have used some other, more advanced Core Secrets workouts (""Accelerated Core Training"" and ""Full Body Challenge"", both excellent programs). I wanted to get this program because I thought I'd pick up some extra tips about working with the stability ball. It was definitely worth getting because Gunnar is a world class personal trainer who has a gift for clear and concise instructions. He gives you plenty of information without overinstucting which makes it easy to incorporate what he's telling you.

The program is very well produced in a bright studio and simply filmed so that you can easily follow what is going on. I've had programs in the past that get too carried away with trying to be creative with the camera work in a way that makes it nearly impossible to follow the workout. This program is a pleasure to workout with.

FUNdamentals is definitely a very basic workout that I feel would be exceptional for someone brand new to exercise (or just returning after a long layoff) or great for someone who is an experienced exerciser but new to stability ball work.

I plan on using it as a warm up as well as a way to reinforce my technique with the ball. It's also great to use if you are low on energy or perhaps returning to working out after being sick since it covers the whole body and will stimulate the muscles without over taxing you.

HIGHLY recommended!!!!!",1197158400,10,3084,4.560578661844485

4383978,1,B000PUCMAG,"I like Gunnar and Brooke but this video is simply not challenging enough for the advanced exerciser.
