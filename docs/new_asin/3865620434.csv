The waterfalls include: Barron Gorge, Mossman Gorge, Rainbow Falls, Crystal Cascades, Surprise Creek, Josephine Falls, Zillie Falls, Millaa Millaa Falls, Mungalli Falls and Barron Gorge in Flood.

There are many options for viewing and listening. You can play ambient waterfalls (41 minutes) with music and nature sounds or just solo piano or just nature sounds. I found that with the solo piano there were still some nature sounds between songs.

I felt that there was a good variety of waterfalls from various angles and distances. This DVD is truly mesmerizing. The water colors are really pretty including emerald green, golden yellow, sapphire blue and orange rust.

What I like about this DVD is that you can also play individual waterfalls. This gives you a chance to hear all the gurgling, churning and splashing of each waterfall.

I will say that my cats especially liked this DVD. They were crawling all over the TV and looking at the screen inquisitively. I think it was the nature sounds that captured their interest.

God sure designed the world to impress us and to fill us with awe. This DVD has some of the most beautiful waterfalls on earth. I highly recommend it for a relaxing experience.
