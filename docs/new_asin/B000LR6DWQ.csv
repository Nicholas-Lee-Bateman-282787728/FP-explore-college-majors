8163843,5,B000LR6DWQ,"I been reading Thomas Merton for more than 15years, his teachings have made an important impact in my life. I have never stopped learning from his books.

8163847,2,B000LR6DWQ,"This film on Merton is disappointing. They left out so much that was important, despite the fact that they had the courage to mention Merton's affair with Margie. You're better off getting the much older video ""Merton -- A Film Biography,"" which, although it doesn't mention the affair, gives a much more thorough overview of Merton's writings and life.",1223769600,25,353,5.0
