618954,5,6303300707,"Most of the production is said here. I just can say that this is probably the best opera of those ""minor operas"" verdi wrote. Picture is very good, considering the quality resolution at that time. The stereo sound is worth it. There's no choice to change or switch off subtitles.

This production is from 1991 and from Image. Now, when there are many productions from LaScala coming up, and the ""I vespri Siciliani"" (from Image too) was re-released by Opus Arte, i guess we can have this opera again in the market. So, take the chance. Is definitely a must have.",1102118400,3,562,4.564356435643564
618955,5,6303300707,"The Christianity was a bit much.  I wanted to throw up.  There was simply no plot at all.  And this opera more than any I have ever seen exemplifies the stereotypical idea of opera with characters standing rooted to the spot just singing.  That said, this was a marvelous experience.  Rich, beautiful, powerful music.  Ramey was nothing less than great.  (And that wonderful open embracing smile during his curtain call!)  Studer was the jewel of Attila.  Everyone else was okay.  I spent an afternoon searching every record store and website I knew of to find a copy of this glorious opera.  There is simply none to be had except the $145 disc here on Amazon.  No.  (I noticed an ""Et tu, Brute?"" at the end (spelling of Brute?), Verdi (or his librettist) did love Shakespeare.)  I loved and ejoyed the hell out of this opera, with the reservations given, fortunately I have the same cast, conductor and orchestra on CD, so I am not completely disappointed.  But I would really like to have this DVD (I rented the one I just watched).  The sets and scene changes were lush and delicious, the colors were beautiful, the music was beautiful.  This is a wonderful opera.  Maybe it will come back into print, it's alive in Europe I found out, but the DVD won't play in this country.",1092960000,2,1278,4.579646017699115
618956,3,6303300707,"Sorry, I'm going to be a dissenter here. Can't add anything to the evaluation of the performance itself, since the other reviewers have said all that needs to be said.
But the work itself is not intrinsically outstanding. Good, but not great. Since I take it that one's rating ought to be of the intrinsic artistic value of the performance, that means that significant weight ought to be placed on the merits of the underlying work.
I place emphasis on this for the following reason: based on the reviews here, I was thinking of purchasing Attila. After all, I reasoned, better buy a great performance of a lesser work than a so-so performance of a central work. Fortunately, I have access to a good college library which has an excellent opera collection. I'm glad I didn't spend my money.
If you have lots of money, and have seen Traviata, Don Giovanni, and Walkure four or five times each, then sure, treat yourself to something different. But if you are new to opera, and are looking for a great introduction to the form, there are plenty of very good to excellent performances of more central works available here. Go for those first.",1066435200,5,1139,4.6716417910447765
618957,5,6303300707,"Ramey makes the whole thing work. His voice and ability to  dominate the stage make this production work. Atilla is not a great opera, but when well performed, as it is here, it's enjoyable and impressive.",1061596800,2,205,4.694444444444445
618958,5,6303300707,"This one is outstanding performance done by second to none artists. I have been seating breathless from the first up to last sound of this beauty. If you one like me, seek on Verdi, this definitely for you. I rent this DVD from Netflix and kept it for 1 mount but finally decided to get my own.
I highly recommend watch to this one.",1030752000,4,332,4.203125
618959,5,6303300707,"This opera is one of Verdi's forgotten ones perhaps because you need powerful and commanding voices to sing it. One couldn't hope for a better Attila than Samuel Ramey. He is simply vocally at his best and his acting is terrific.  Cheryl Studer is a powerful Odabella and the Italian baritone Giorgio Zancanaro is outstanding. If you love Verdi's Nabucco, you will love Attila. I think that the Italians have it over the Americans; the Chorus is wonderful.  The conductor, Riccardo Muti, is perhaps one of the best. This was the first opera I bought on DVD and I have gone back to it over and over. Please buy this one. It's worth the money.",992822400,14,641,4.565217391304348
618960,5,6303300707,"This opera is capable of overwhelming any audience with a penchant for Verdi.  Sensibly staged with great video and audio,this particular opera maintains high production standards throughout.  Even Cherly Studer brings off a very suitable impersonation of the warrior maiden Odabella.  The polished, spirted work of chorus and orchestra is testimony to Ricardo Muti's ability to maintain the standards at La Scala.  It's only 118 minutes long, so you won't get bored.  Buy it . . . You'll love it.",992131200,7,497,5.1625
618961,5,6303300707,"Ramey and Studer triumph in a spectacular performance. Ramey's resonant bass rings true and powerful. Ranks up there with his Mefistofele! I cannot imagine this role more superbly sung and acted. Chicago Lyric Opera is in  for much excitement next season when he does this role for them with such  commanding and thrilling tone. Studer sings in the same league and calibre:  rich tone, secure and powerful high notes with dramatic intensity, simply  an all out no stops performance. Her soft notes are beautiful and her duets  with the tenor Kaludov are equally memorable. He is not quite in her league  but he does some fine singing. Wonderful production. Only Zancanaro lets  down the side a litle but then it is not much of a role to start with. La  Scala  can be proud of this performance - which ranks high with their  Domingo ""Fanciulla"" - and we are luckier than the audience  present since we can see it at will.",955065600,13,920,4.6521739130434785
618962,5,6303300707,"Where do I start?  From the overture to the last scene this opera is packed with punch.  I find it hard to believe that such a great opera is not performed live more often.  Maybe it's because no one will dare tackle  Attila's role after seeing Samuel Ramey sing and act it to perfection.  What an incredible performance by Ramey.  Studer is a bit screamy in this  one, Kaludov is somewhat whimpy but Zancanaro is solid.  Ramey's  performance is so good that on his strength alone this one gets all five  stars.  This is a must buy for any Verdi fan and a great buy for all  others.",954892800,6,582,4.287037037037037
619055,4,6303300707,"Sam's voice was so clear and rounded,placed perfectly. His acting you can't ask for any more. Fabulous!!!!My biggest surprise was Ms. Studer. I remember her only once before and never knew what happened to her after her Met debut. She was very good. Ofcourse this performance has Riccardo Muti genius in it what can you say. If you haven't seen it or heard it do yourself a favour",1306281600,2,380,4.602941176470588

619057,5,6303300707,I have several Attilas but I like this one best.  Studer really put out some venom which I hadn't seen or heard her do before and in very difficult singing.  In Vespri she was conflicted......but not here.  I first heard Ramey live in Mephistopheles probably  30 years ago.  He was amazing.  He's still pretty good here but not quite what he was.  Still very impressive.  Zancanaro also seems to be showing age a bit vocally......still I like him a lot.  I like the staging too.,1248912000,5,478,4.529411764705882
619058,4,6303300707,I am not an Opera fanatic but do like Samuel Ramey.  I will agree with the previous reviewer who said the sets lacked originality.  Cheryl Studer has a super voice and Samuel Ramey conveyed his wonderful voice to a believable Attila.,1224028800,,233,4.658536585365853
619059,5,6303300707,"The standouts in this extraordinary live recording are the fine Odabella of soprano Cheryl Studer, caught in the prime of her youth and the Ezio of Giorgio Zancanaro. Well, at the scrupulous conducting of Maestro Muti. Ramey is fine in the title role if a bit hammy for my taste. Still, this video is worthy of 10 (out of 10) stars. Do not miss this!",1191542400,2,350,4.4
619060,3,6303300707,It was good. I've received the product in according to my expectation time,1124236800,,74,4.769230769230769
619061,5,6303300707,"Verdi's opera 'Attila' premiered on St Patrick's day 1846 receives a winning performance by Riccardo Muti's La Scala forces. Every time Muti undertakes the direction of a Verdi opera one can expect the earth to move and here expectations are far from disappointed. The score is very uneven where passages of genius join hands with passages of merely routine competency. It's hard to believe that 'Macbeth' (even in its 1847 version) would follow it. Nonetheless given an excellent cast the opera can excite, and an excellent cast is what this production gets. Samuel Ramey in the title part is a regal Attila more noble than the noblest of Romans. Giorgio Zancanaro as the Moesian traitor, (not Italian traitor as the commentators inaccurately describe him)Ezio leader of the Roman armies provides an external nobility to the character and conveys his cynicism and dillusionment in his Act II aria 'Dagli immortali vertici, a true Verdi baritone aria. Odabella as sung by Cheryl Studer sings with bite paricularly in her 'aria di sortita' but can provide bel canto where needed in  the romanza'O nel fuggente nuvolo' and in 'Te sol quest'anima' the trio made famous by the Gigli/Rethberg/Pinza recording of the 78 era. Bulgarian Kaludi sings lyrically as Foresto, dramatically the least interesting character in the opera and Mario Luperi makes a good impact as Leone, the historical Pope Leo I. The opera was based on a tragedy by Hans Zacharias Werner which in its original form was more Wagnerian than Verdian. The librettist Solera transformed into the standard operatic fodder of the era. The opera cannot be said to be historically accurate. The sack of Aquileia which historically followed the scene where Leone drives Attila back from Rome ' Thou art appointed as a scourge against mortals only. Withdraw! this is the territory of the Gods.' precedes it in the opera. A scene of the foundation of Venice absent in Werner's play was inserted to please the Venetians in whose city the opera was premiered. In Act II Ezio describes the Western emperor Valentinian as a 'coronato fanciul' (crowned child)when the said Valentinian is in fact middle-aged, and though Moesian calls himself the 'last of the Romans' (l'ultimo Romano).  Furthermore, the historical Attila died on his wedding day as in the opera  but the true manner of his death was not such to be portrayed on the operatic stage in 1846. Let's just say he died in the exercise of his conjugal rights! The La Scala production captures the cruelty and political instability of the era even if the historical inaccuracies are compounded by placing Rome by the seaside. Inaccuracies aside the production is a feast to the eyes and ears. The La Scala chorus are exciting as always.",1119225600,30,2743,4.99781181619256
619062,5,6303300707,"Loved it from the moment Odabella (played masterfully by Cheryl Struder) jumped into Attila's face, and took his sword.  She sings a song about killing him for vengeance, while he falls in love with this fiesty slave. Well sung and played by all four of the principles.  It remains on my ""desert island"" list of 6, out of about 120 operas I have seen.  If you love Verdi, as I do, you won't regret buying this one.",1111276800,5,414,4.35064935064935
619063,4,6303300707,"This is an outstanding performance: well-staged, acted, and musically very satisfying. I didn't know what to expect, other than a lesser-known Verdi opera, and found it engaging and moving.  It deserves to more popular.  Samuel Ramey in the title role is as always a thrilling presence with a magnificent voice.  Note: Having lived for awhile in Hungary, I learned that Attila is hardly seen as a barbarian but a national hero.  Many name their boys after him (accent on the 1st syllable, BTW).",1110412800,15,494,4.9156626506024095
619064,4,6303300707,"Let's be honest, 'Attila' is not out of Verdi's top drawer. It was one of the products of his 'galley years' before he broke through into a new language and a new form with 'Rigoletto' four years later. But it certainly has its moments, and when a basso the caliber of Samuel Ramey sings the title part, it's worth seeing and hearing. This performance is from the vaults of Italian television (RAI) and newly released, although there apparently has been an earlier release of this or a similar performance on another label. Virtually the same cast is in the CD set recorded at about the same time as this video of the 1991 La Scala production; the only principal that was different was Neil Shicoff as Foresto, sung here by a tenor unknown to me, Kaludi Kaludov. The stars of this production--which has only one named female role--are the two enemies, Attila and Ezio, a Roman general. And both roles here are taken by first-rate singers: Ramey, and Giorgio Zancanaro as Ezio. And each turns in a really fine performance. Ramey, of course, was known for this role, one he performed all over the world. With his trim figure, commanding stage presence (including a hunky bared chest--shades of Yul Brynner!--in Acts I & II) and huge bass voice, he made the role his own. We are fortunate to have this record of it.

The other two roles of importance--Odabella and Foresto--are not quite so fortunate. Cheryl Studer was not in particularly good voice for this performance. Her top was in fine condition, but once she got into her middle voice and particularly into her chest voice, she tended to fade out, and not because the orchestra covered her; the volume simply wasn't there. One could imagine that perhaps she was portraying the role as a 'gentlewoman' but indeed the role of Odabella is that of a warrior and gentleness has little place here. Her lover, Foresto, is taken by Kudalov who has a moderately attractive middle-sized voice that he handles rather woodenly, which fits his acting. But the singing of both Ramey and Zancanaro is thrilling throughout.

The staging is rather unimaginative, although the sets and costumes are really fairly impressive. Musically, of course, this IS Verdi, but before he got much beyond simple I-IV-V-I sequences. The most memorable melodies are those of Ezio's Act II  'Dagl'immortali vertici,' sung fabulously by Zancanaro, and Attila's Act I cavatina, 'Mentre gonfiarsi l'anima' and its following cabaletta. Much of the music otherwise is rather faceless. Thank goodness, at least there is no stage band as so often in Verdi's early operas!

The main reason to get this DVD is to see and preserve the most famous role of one of America's finest recent gifts to the world opera scene: Samuel Ramey as 'Attila.' It's worth it for that alone. He is spectacular.

7842830,5,6303300707,"The entire cast is great.  Cheryl Studer is magnificent.  Ramey and Zancanaro are even better.  Verdi gave Ramey and Zancanaro plenty of opportunities to stand and sing in this one but they never do.  Always Ramey and Zancanaro are delivering first rate theatrical performances.

I hesitated to buy this Attila because recently I bought a few ""second string"" opera dvds and was disappointed and sorry I spent my money on them.  But I am not disappointed in the least in this Attila.  Most highly recommended.  ~ Celeste Downey",1481587200,,526,4.8977272727272725

7842834,5,6303300707,"This is the 8th opera I have viewed from the ten opera ""La Scala Opera Set"" and for me, so far it is by far the best performance. All were made for the Italian RAI for TV broadcast during the late '80s and early '90s.

The opera is considered second line Verdi and it most assuredly is not one of Verdi's best. It does not have all the great memorable arias as do ""Trovatore', ""Aida"" and ""Rigoletto"" and others, but it has enough of them and the story is pretty simple and easy to understand and its a  great vehicle for a great macho bass. Besides, second line Verdi is much better than most all other composers' first line work. The music is all typical Verdi and very listenable and enjoyable.

Although I have never seen this opera before viewing this performance and I have no basis of comparison, I believe this performance to be very fine indeed. The greatest attribute is the wonderful ""Atilla"" of Samuel Ramey. He seems to ""own"" the role and ""own"" the stage. He has a magnificent bass voice and he has made this role his own. All the other principals are never less than good, and for much of the opera they are very good to excellent. Mutti gives a dramatic reading. well played by the La Scala forces. The sets and costumes are opulent and appropriate for the time and place. The stage direction is routine, but not intrusive and the lighting a bit dark, but ok.

The audio is 1990 non dts High Def or 5.1 surround and the video is a little grainy non Blu Ray. Both audio and video are OK, but not state of the art.

7842837,5,6303300707,"This remains one of my top 5 operas. Samuel Ramey does not disappoint. Only he could make you be sympathetic to Attila the Hun.

7842838,5,6303300707,"Operatic bedbugs aside (those who extract critical blood out of every performance, but only repeat commonplaces), this is a huge-voice opera that most singers, though they may have recorded its arias, (Caballe, Callas) did not dare to tackle in its entirety. Not so with Ramey and Studer, who astonish with the brilliancy of their singing and their acting.  The opera has only one female voice that must hold its own against powerful basses, baritones and tenors.  Ramey is simply awesome, physically and vocally.  Studer is totally fearless, singing with what one has to call sheer glee. The other roles are equally brilliantly covered.  I said before opera is about visual and aural perception.  The production is perfect.  Mutti looks like a Roman god.  If you want to learn what Verdi is all about, this is a must-have. Not surprisingly, it seems never to have come to New York.
