The video is so poorly compressed, I'd offer to do the compression work for a re-release of these for free because I worked on the show and am horrified how bad this looks on screen.

Having said that, this show is awesome.  I grew up on the original show and had the privilege to work on this series.  Shout out to all the cast and crew.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Nice to finally be able to watch what you worked on 20 years later!",1530835200,,589,4.196428571428571
