8232531,1,B000YFFBJQ,"This product is a rip-off. The first part, the ""Best of Laurel and Hardy"" consists of a boring short created as a charity fundraiser that has a ten second clip of Laurel and Hardy. Enjoy that--because that is the only time you will actually see Laurel and Hardy together in this entire set. The rest of the shorts feature only Stan Laurel, and they are all of very poor visual quality, and the accompanying music has no relation to the visuals. The Keystone Cops set is also misleading. These are certainly not the best Keystone Cops shorts--instead they are second-rate shorts created by the Keystone studio. This product is shameless and deceptive. Do not buy it--you will be very, very sorry (even for $5.95).",1237075200,9,712,4.75
