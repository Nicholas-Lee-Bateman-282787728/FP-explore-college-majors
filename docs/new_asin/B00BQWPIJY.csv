8572849,5,B00BQWPIJY,I am a fan of science fiction and this anime really appealed to me. I loved the art and the movement and flow of the story. It is as if someone had a video to this time and space and was recording an event. The reflections seem almost as if captured by a not so perfect video device. It is sort of romantic without being real mushy. And is sad too. Sacrifices in past and present is always part of life to make the future a bit better.,1434153600,,435,3.9545454545454546
