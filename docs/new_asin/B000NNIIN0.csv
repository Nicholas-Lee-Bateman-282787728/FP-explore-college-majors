8179324,5,B000NNIIN0,"My first encounter with Miles O'Keefe was about a year ago in a local video store.  I was perusing the bargain bin for some hidden gems and came across a DVD entitled ""Cartel"".  In this movie Miles plays Chuck Taylor, a charter pilot who gets hired to unknowingly fly cocaine into the U.S. for the Cartel.  When Taylor arrives in the U.S., he is picked up by the Feds and thrown in jail.  The leader of the Cartel -- Tony King -- also happens to be Taylor's cell mate and is not too pleased that his stash is gone.  The two battle it out behind bars and King ends up having Taylor's family killed and thus begins Taylor's campaign of vengeance.  I was an immediate fan.

Fast foward a year.

A friend of mine and myself are in a Dollar Store looking around.  We have a penchant for frequenting flea markets/dollar stores/Salvation Armies in hopes of coming across some treasure that has been otherwise forgotten by others.  Well today was no exception.  As we were browsing through a small book shelf stocked with $1 DVDs -- I'm talking C-movies here -- we come across Phantom Raiders.

I immediately recognized the man on the cover of the Phantom Raiders DVD; it was Miles O'Keefe.  I immediately added that DVD to my collection I had amassed that day.  As I was reading the description on the back of the DVD, I knew immediately this was going to be as good, if not better, than ""Cartel"".

The movie breaks down like this:

Python Lang(O'Keefe) is employed by the CIA to gather up a team of ninja commandos and go deep in the jungles of Vietnam to see whether a rouge ex-Green Beret(Col. William Marshall) is training terrorists or if he's merely a POW ; a photographer stumbled upon the compound and took photos which made their way back to the CIA after the photographer was killed.  Python is instructed to track down three Vietnam vets, who just so happen to be drug dealers now, and inform them that the CIA needs their help.  Why in God's holy name they chose these three is beyond me, but I must say they looked phenomenal in camo-ninja outfits.

Python informs the motely crue that they will be paid $250,000 each if they agree to the mission.  They agree and so begins their training to become ninja commandos.  The training is your typical '80s action-movie training: zip cords; explosions; grenades; snipers w/live rounds; throwing ropes; ninja stars; trip wire education and so on.  Once the three vets become properly trained, it's off to Vietnam.  One thing that has O'Keefe worried is that Col. Marshall's son is also a part of the team, fearing his involvement will cloud his judgement and endanger the mission.  After some reassuring, the CIA agree to let the younger Marshall join the team.

What follows the ninja commandos arriving in Vietnam can only be described as cinematic glory.  Exlposions, gun fights, ninja star attacks and just some good old action scenes.  Never mind that when there is shooting, the aim is completely off, yet the ninja commandos seem to be able to wipe out a group of 12 enemy combatants.  One of the many goof ups in the movie is about half way in when the ninja commandos arrive in Vietnam; Python throws a grenade at three enemy soldiers, yet the explosion takes place well before the grenade hits the ground and you can actually see the grenade that was thrown hit the ground after the explosion.  Also, keep an eye on where the explosion takes place and watch a fire light up way too late.

I highly recommend getting this movie, as well as ""Cartel"", and see what Miles O'Keefe is really about.",1215993600,4,3551,4.581616481774961
