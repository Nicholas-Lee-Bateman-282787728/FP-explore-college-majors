8449303,5,B0011367TS,"I loved the DVDs really interesting my favorite ones were the F/A-18 Hornet, F-14 and F-15. I think these were the best DVDs Topics has made, So the DVDs were great but the box was HORRIBLE it was packed all together in one i thought it would be those DVD boxes but they were not,I was checking to see if there were any scratches but there were a little bit but they all worked. Anyways the DVDS  were GREAT",1356393600,,407,4.151898734177215
8449304,4,B0011367TS,Fighter Pilot DVD get us a very good information. Almost all discs has very good photography but one disc (F-15) has old films and some scene appear twice or three times. In general I like this product.,1263168000,,202,4.486486486486487
