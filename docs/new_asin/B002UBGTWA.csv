8381161,5,B002UBGTWA,"I have a son with autism who is obsessed with trains.  We had a vast selection of train documentary videos but several years ago, we got rid of our VHS player and have been gradually replacing our son's favourite videos with DVDs. We were glad to find this one available in DVD format (not all of them are and it's been rather traumatic for him).",1392595200,,346,4.323076923076923
