2706883,3,B000LE16T4,Its could be just my little one but this movie did not hold his interest at all and he LOVED Dora at the time I bought it. He put it in and I don't even think he finished watching it before he took it out and put on something else never to return to this movie again.,1353456000,,267,3.7017543859649122
2706884,5,B000LE16T4,"Our 3 1/2 year old grandson has probably watched this at least 10-15 times.  He enjoys the story and loves the music.  Even his older sisters, ages 7 and 9, watch with him.  Highly recommended!",1336003200,,193,4.457142857142857
2706885,5,B000LE16T4,"Whenever I don't know what to buy my daughter for a gift, Dora always works!! Ive watched a few episodes with her and it seems to teach her better than I can. Dora has some kind of hypnotic effect on these kids and I don't mind at ALL!! Im happy, my daughter is happy! Thats what matters!",1318464000,,288,4.0701754385964914
2706886,4,B000LE16T4,This dvd helps a lot in the car when we need it to keep sane during road trips.  Seems to hold kids' attention pretty well with songs that are not too annoying for parents.,1297814400,,172,4.0588235294117645
2706887,5,B000LE16T4,"Well what can I say Dora does it again. Great DVD!! Both my 2 1/2 yr. old granddaughter and my 3 year old grandson loves this DVD. My granddaughter and I have watched it many, many times already. Dora teaches that if you ask nicely sometimes people will just give you back what they took from you. Private Piggies give us back our treasure chest. I would recommend buying this if you child is into Dora. You will not be disappointed.",1283644800,,433,4.3580246913580245
2706888,5,B000LE16T4,"I bought this as part of a treasure hunt for my 2.5 year old granddaughter. This is the treasure she liked best. She mimics the characters every step of the way and has learned several new words. Her giggles when they sing the silly songs are absolutely irresistible, like

 Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,

2706891,5,B000LE16T4,"This is the best Dora DVD, my 3 year old daughter watches it nonstop and dances with it everytime!! I am thinking of getting her another one in case this one gets broken as she uses it so heavily. Great music education, even adults get to love the songs. Our favorite part is when Swiper sings his line "" Oh...man"" in a dramatical way, so funny!!  We also love ""Dora's World Advanture"", it comes with the three DVD combo which has Pirate Advanture, World Advanture and Fairy Tale Adavanture"".",1269907200,,492,4.52808988764045

2706893,5,B000LE16T4,"This DVD was even better than the Map Adventures.  It was longer and more interactive.  My granddaughter just loves it.  As soon as she comes through the door she asks for her fishy crackers, chocolate milk, and the DVD on ""Pop's TV"".  It is great to see her so focused on the stories. She is very smart and gets involved when the map is used and when Swiper the Fox tries to swipe things during the story.  I get as much fun out of watching her as she does watching the story.  Anyone with young children or grandchildren should at least consider these items.  I wish I had had the opportunity to buy stock in the company which owns the rights!",1268092800,,645,4.2809917355371905

2706895,4,B000LE16T4,"My daughter has said Pirate Piggies enough times for me to remember it.  Most Dora DVDs are loved by little kids in the pre-K to K age range.  I bought this along with a couple other Dora DVDs because of this reason.  It's good for the kids to watch some of these episodes over several times, they remember more words and start building their vocabulary early on.",1247961600,,363,4.388059701492537
2706896,4,B000LE16T4,"Our oldest is 3 years old and as parents, we have made a conscious decision to not expose our daughter to too much TV until she is older.  We have Blues Clues and Thomas videos, which she loves and are not bad to sit through as a parent.  I recently added this Dora video to our collection.  Needless to say she loves it.  She sings the songs and talks about Dora's adventures regularly.

There is no question the video will be a hit with the youngsters, but when looking for a Dora video to buy, I searched for the least annoying one for parents.  I did as much research as I could and was convinced this was it.  While it is not too bad as far as Dora goes, it certainly is more annoying than the few other Kids titles we watch.

One other note: the main episode is double length, approximately 40 minutes.  This can be a good or bad thing, depending on your tolerance for Dora and how and when you are using the video.",1240531200,,921,4.15819209039548

2706900,5,B000LE16T4,"We own several Dora dvds, and this is by far the best, mainly for the feature episode, Dora's Pirate Adventure.  Even though this runs at about 45 minutes, the story is easy to follow for pre-schoolers.  The pirate costumes are cute, the pirate piggies are not scary, and the songs are catchy.  It's even a little snarky, as Swiper the Fox hammily sings his tagline, ""Oh Man!""  My 4-year old son loves that part.",1186963200,,412,4.527027027027027
2706901,5,B000LE16T4,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter loves the singing and music.  I like the Spanish/English vocabulary concept.  I also like that the DVD talks to her and asks her questions.  She isn't old enough to answer yet, but when she is, I think she will think it's a lot of fun!",1170288000,,262,4.098039215686274
2706902,3,B000LE16T4,"My daughter (28 Months) got this as a gift.  She loves this and the other 2 Dora DVDs she got for Christmas.

As a parent, I find it reprehensible that there are advertisements for other children's products before the main feature.  There are a ton of them and you can skip them, but they are so directly aimed at young people that your child won't want you to!  It is shameless!

Further, the repeat play function is awful.  And you can't shut it off!  This DVD will just play all day and night if you let it.  When I shut it off, my daughter is always disappointed and feels like ""it's not over.""  they easily could have made this an option (as Baby Einstein DVDs have).  Also, 3 episodes in a row is too long!  They also run one after the other, without any buttons needing to be pushed.  They could easily have made this an option too or given you the option, like ""Little People"" does, to play all or only one.

The content of the Dora adventures themselves is terrific, but the maker of this DVD should be ashamed of themselves for including so many ads and should have been smarter about the repeat play function!",1169337600,,1120,4.326923076923077
2706903,5,B000LE16T4,All the Dora Explorer Items are great.  My 3 1/2 loves them all.  She plays with all and intermingales them.  They are good toys for the imagination.,1168300800,,149,4.444444444444445
2706904,5,B000LE16T4,REALLY GOOD EPISODE OF DORA.  MY CHILDREN AND I ENJOY IT.  IT IS VERY EDUCATIONAL AND FUN.  HAVEING A MOVIE WITH DORA AND DIEGO MADE IT WORTH WATCHING.  MY DAUGHTER LOVES DORA AND MY SON LOVES DIEGO.  IN THIS MOVIE THEY TAKE ON THE ADVENTURES TOGETHER.  DEFINITELY THE ONE TO HAVE IN YOUR HOME.,1167350400,,294,4.351851851851852
2706905,4,B000LE16T4,This is a very good DVD.  My four and a half year old son received this DVD from his grandmother as a gift and loves it!  It is different than the episodes shown on tv and certainly utilizes all of Dora's problem solving skills during her adventures.  A must for all Dora the Explorer fans out there.,1163030400,,300,4.228070175438597
2706906,5,B000LE16T4,"My grand daughter, age 2, watched this ""movie"" over and over. She enjoyed it very much. The rest of us enjoyed watching her reaction to the adventure. I am sure we will be watching it many more times with her.",1151193600,,209,4.25
2706907,5,B000LE16T4,"I am a 20 year old man who really enjoys this show. I first started watching Dora about a year ago and became hooked on it. I watched it with my girlfriends 4 year old daughter night and day. We had all the toys, the house, the backpack, name it we had it. Dora is so well done. I basically learned Spanish through watching this show. I still wake up everyday to catch the episodes on Nick Jr and Noggin. Pirate adventure is my favorite Episode right next to Big Sister Dora. I love pigs. This is just a great program that, as you can see, is fun for any ages.",1144627200,,560,4.054054054054054

2706909,4,B000LE16T4,My 3 yr old daughter loves this video. I would recommend it to any Dora lovers.,1129593600,,79,4.0
2706910,4,B000LE16T4,"I bought it for my almost 3 yr. old grandson who loves all of the Dora CD's.  Because they repeat words in spanish he has been able to pick up & repeat them both in English & Spanish at other times.  However, the backpack sings the song in Spanish which I find is a drawback as I don't know & he doesn't know the language other than a few words.  The next segment on the cd with the witch, he found scary so we had to shut it off.  I will put it away & bring it out at another time for him.",1129075200,,490,3.7281553398058254
2706911,5,B000LE16T4,"This musical is the BEST Dora DVD yet!  The music is catchy and the storyline is really cute.  My husband and I bought this for our 2 year old and he wants to watch it EVERY DAY!!  The great thing is the music is so great and the words they learn are so neat that WE love to watch it too!  We've had it for 2 weeks and have watched it EVERY DAY since we purchased it and we still aren't tired of it.  As a matter of fact, my husband and I have found ourselves humming the songs at work, and other places even when the kids aren't with us.  This is a MUST have for any parent of a pre-schooler!!! Highly recommended!!!",1120521600,,617,3.935483870967742
2706912,5,B000LE16T4,"In this children's video, Dora and her friends are about to put on a pirate play, until their costumes are stolen by real pirates. The premise of this fun children's musical tale is to follow a map, find the pirates and the costumes, and happily resume their play.

I actually enjoyed this video almost as much as my Pre-K class that I showed it to. First of all, I loved that Dora and her crew are bi-lingual. Interspersed within the dialog is a smidgen of""Holas"", ""Attencions"", and some ""Donde estas?"". My Spanish speaking students perked up as they heard their familiar language, while my English speaking students easily picked up some new words.

The video also teaches math and map skills, as the children were encouraged to count along, following land marks to get to the final hiding place of the pirates. Directionality is taught amid all the singing and dancing, as children are encouraged to find certain objects and the unanimous response from them was ""Behind you.""

Pirate Adventure is very participatory, with the viewer singing and following along. Dora continuously talks to the viewer, asks questions, and pauses while waiting for the children to respond orally. There was a refrain throughout the show and the children were happy to join in the repetition, by chanting ""Give us back our treasure!""

The children watching Dora the Explorer- Pirate Adventure were very attentive and responsive and I was so pleased that beside the obvious entertainment value in the singing and the dancing, the children were learning both math and literacy skills. Again, I especially liked the value of Spanish being used, as it empowers the Spanish speaking child to hear his native tongue, and it broadens the English speaking child in accepting a larger world outside of himself.",1120435200,,1784,4.976510067114094
2706913,5,B000LE16T4,My little boy never gets tired of watching this movie. I do of course because it is so cheesy - but as long as he is entertained that's really all that matters.,1113782400,,160,4.03125
2706914,5,B000LE16T4,"My 2 year old is Dora obsessed. She has the couch, dinnerware set, books, blocks, doll, dvd's, swimsuit and slippers and sheet set. We own all her DVD's with the exception of 1, and this is my daughter's fave. The first feature is 40 minutes and it takes Dora and ALL her friends on an adventure to get their treasure chest. Dora for anyone who isn't familiar basically has the same layout for every episode but in this the songs are a little different. Swiper even sings his Oh Man! There are two other episodes which are about 20 minutes each. All of the episodes incorporate Spanish as we follow Dora and Boots on their adventures. My fave are the special features on this disc. There are flash cards and previews and even a snippet with Oobi but the best is the Sing Alongs. This dvd always gets my daughter singing and dancing. I do sometimes feel as though I'm surronded by Dora but it's worth the monotony for me a slong as my daughter enjoys it. This is a dvd tthat will be sure to please any Dora fan or toddler.",1103241600,,1021,4.322916666666667
2706915,5,B000LE16T4,i have 2 cousins and 2 brothers who love the dora series.  all the dora movies are movies kids enjoy.  my cousins and brothers have some of them memorized and love to talk along with dora and boots.  most importantly this show teaches kids how to count in english and spanish.  it also teaches them shapes and colors and all sorts of other things that u want little kids to learn.  this movie is also good because u can watch it with them and not be bored to tears like u do on some other baby movies.,1102723200,,501,4.123711340206185
2706916,5,B000LE16T4,My children love this DVD.  After watching it they sing parts of the songs for days.  They learned what fog is on this episode.  That's what I love about Dora and other educational/fun shows.  They use good cause and effect and expose children to new things.  I also like that they aren't violent or crude like some shows that say they are for children.,1102032000,,353,4.453125
2706917,5,B000LE16T4,"Nothing gets my two year old son more excited than the site of a new Dora video from Amazon! I can almost see his mind growing as he learns along with Dora, Boots, and the other fun characters. My son would give Dora an Oscar for Best Actress, and Boots the Best Actor award. And thanks to Dora the Explorer, he would present it in Spanish!",1093910400,,340,4.166666666666667
2706918,5,B000LE16T4,"This DVD is one of my daughter's favorites.  She loves Dora and watches her DVDs over and over.  If she's going to watch TV, I like these for the educational level (repetition and participation with a little Spanish mixed in).  She loves singing along and imitating Swiper ""OH, MAAAAN!""",1092787200,,286,4.795918367346939

It is nice to know she is learning while being entertained!",1086912000,,370,4.661538461538462

I find them to be very educational and Caitlin picks up words and phrases constantly as well as learns the names of animals and other objects.
It's a terrific thrill to hear her yell ""I did it"" after she accomplishes soemthing new and special.
I think she's gotten more out of Dora videos than Bay Einstein - and they are a lot less annoying to the adults.",1086566400,,468,4.329545454545454
2706921,4,B000LE16T4,"My daughter  (3 yrs.) loves Dora and this is one of her favorites. She especially thinks the bridge that doesn't know the words to the songs is hilarious and giggles with delight everytime the Bridge sings ""Old McDonald had some PANTS! Oui,oui, oui!"" The only thing that made me take a star from this was when Mochila/backpack sings the backpack song in Spanish - we are all bilingual, my 3 yr old included,  and when the Mochila (backpack) began singing the song in Spanish, I was delighted til I realized I could not understand what it was saying....it was garbled...my husband and I looked at each other and said ""QUE??"" but  we had to laugh when my 3 your old looked at us and  said ""What he say?""...
Other then that, the tape is great! Definitely a buyer!",1084924800,,760,4.4855072463768115
2706922,5,B000LE16T4,"My 3 yr old is a Dora FANATIC.  My ongoing joke is if they would come out w/ Dora toilet paper, my home would officially be completely Dora. :)  But of all the videos she has (and I beleive she has them all) this one is great.  I have to admit, that as an adult, this was a little annoying at first.  (Hearing the little friends and Dora singing ""Empuje! Empuje!"" really loud over & over was nearly enough to send this stressed out mom over the edge....) However, I have grown to love it.  First, she has picked up SO MUCH Spanish from this video, much more than she has from her other videos or Dora books.  I'm amazed.  Also, she seems to be growing to appreciate the musical format, which is great, since I hope to begin taking her to some Broadway productions soon.  Yes, Dora marketing is very Savy... our Dora LIVE tickets are purchased and I think we have anything that you can buy... but it is well worth it.  My daughter has learned so much from this character, and I'm not only talking about Spanish.  I just love Dora.",1080604800,,1029,4.257731958762887
2706923,5,B000LE16T4,"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES this Dora DVD.  It's in musical form, so if your child loves music -- BUY IT!  My daughter is speaking Spanish all the time now, and she recognizes it when she hears it out in public.  Dora is worth the money!",1077408000,,238,4.2444444444444445
2706924,5,B000LE16T4,"Dora is a great character, and this disk proves many of the reasons why. She's an independent gal who doesn't depend on boys for action and adventure (her cousin Diego is a sidekick rather than the star), but she still plays well with and loves the boys in her life. She speaks both Spanish and English, and is enthusiastic about learning. Her cartoons encourage interaction and movement--and include many basic skills for preschoolers, like language, counting, computer literacy and memorization.
If your kid is glued to the TV anyway, wouldn't you prefer she be learning, exercising and building self-esteem while she watches?
This Nick Jr. DVD is worth the money, though I should warn you that if you buy this DVD, you'll end up buying the Dora backpack, sofa (yes, sofa) and various other Dora products as well. The marketing behind the Dora enterprise is quite savvy. But you'll be so delighted when you hear your 3-year-old counting in Spanish that you might not mind dropping another $10 on the Dora dinnerware set.

8161618,5,B000LE16T4,"Dora The Explorer seems to be a favorite of most 2-3,year olds. They like her voice, and her openness, and the fact that she includes the children in the film. She asks them questions, and they respond in kind with the answer. Dora also speaks in Spamish, and teaches new words to her audience. This is a very creative method to introduce children to Spamish, and to make this part of the mainstream education.

In this film, Dora has a very big adventure. Diego, and Baby Jaguar set sail with Dora's first musical film filled with singing, playing and lots of action! Dora and her friends put on a musical Pirate Play. Dora needs every child's assistance to sing-along along the way. This is a fun, loud adventure and your children will enjoy it.
