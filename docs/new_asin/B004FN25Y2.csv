At least they knew how bad it was and added some full frontal once to keep most men watching. I cannot recommend this film for any reason and suggest you watch Harrison Ford in Blade runner.",1355702400,13,422,4.096385542168675
4370540,1,B004FN25Y2,"If you are bored and for some reason want to watch Clone Hunter then take my advice and read this review instead because its much more entertaining and suspenseful then what this movie could ever offer you. Note: this review will contain spoilers for the B-Movie known as Clone Hunter.

Before I even begin to tell you the first scene in the movie lets take a good look at the box art.  The first thing your innocent eyes probably gravitate too is the half-menacing looking robot.  I will point out that this robot costume probably took half of the budget for the movie.  Underneath the Battlestar Galactica reject robot is a water gun wielding middle aged woman wearing a shiny blue wig.  The expression on her face, which is not remotely flattering, screams what on earth am I doing here.  Underneath blueberry-head is our protagonist who is giving one of his signature dirty looks while aiming his trusty Nerf dart gun.

I must pause a second to elaborate on what I just said.  He is actually holding and, over the course of the movie, uses a Nerf gun as his main movie prop.  For those who are unaware of Nerf guns, they are plastic guns which fire rubber or plastic tipped styrofoam darts (a childs toy).  Needless to say they cannot pass as a gun, not even as a futuristic gun.  Rather than getting anything else that actually resembles a futuristic weapon, the director believes that the nerf gun with a woodland camo pattern on it will be sufficient.  They could easily have built off of the nerf gun and turned it into something more menacing but carboard and paper must have been outside their budget.  Who knows, maybe Nerf funded this this movie in an advertising stunt but after reading the script came to their senses and pulled what funding they could.  Or maybe in the distant future Nerf buys out Smith & Wesson and Glock and actually makes Quantum-photon and laser based weaponry.  Alright lets get back to the main review.
So the combination of a robot, futuristic weapons (water gun & Nerf gun), 2 not remotely intimidating characters, and a space backdrop actually is an accurate portrayal for what to expect in this movie.

If you were you expecting this movie to be rated PG then you should know its actually rated PG-WSE, as in; Please Go Watch Something Else.  For no clarified reason the first 15 seconds of the movie is a naked Asian woman opening up a box, removing a futuristic looking gun, and firing it at the camera.  Where was that futuristic gun when they were photo shooting for the movie cover, I don't know.  I suspect the scotch tape holding it together could only barley endure for the 5 seconds it was filmed.  I support my theory with the fact that the two laser pointers on the firearm were pointing in two different directions and that we never see the gun again over the course of the movie.  Maybe they neglected to pay the nude Asian woman and she just took the gun prop and box in spite.  We may never know.  Nude Asian Woman if you are reading this please feel free to clarify.
So from 0:00:16  0:02:26  we get to hear a blood moving futuristic symphony which Im sure was created by the most talented of orchestras and we get to see those responsible for creating this award winning B-Movie.  Im just kidding, it didn't win any awards, are you surprised? After that, you get to watch 34 seconds of a picture of some nondescript red planet with no explanation.  At some point you get to listen to everyones favorite sound, radio static.  We are then suddenly torn away from the unidentified planet and begin watching incredible CGI of a spacecraft flying in orbit of the planet.  Note: The CGI is incredible only when compared to the graphics on a Super Nintendo.  We then hear the voice of what is presumably a female pilot requesting permission to land on the planet in a way which appears to coincide with FAA regulations.  The camera then starts showing different angles of what is our protagonists space craft, but the decision to do this was not wise for the director.  The sperm cell shaped ship only has one wing and one engine awkwardly placed in the rear left corner which begs to ask many questions like; how is this plane aerodynamic and why does it have only one wing and one engine? It would have taken all of 3 minutes for the movies tech team to duplicate the wing and engine to the other side making it appear normal but maybe there is a deeper meaning or metaphor behind the decision to have one wing.  If you find the reason or detect the metaphor let me and the director know because neither of us do.  The next minute and a half is a verbal altercation between the woman pilot and the planets security team/landing clearance team.  The planets security was most likely unwilling to allow such a poorly made space craft to land on their planet so they claimed that her landing codes were not authentic.  The verbal altercation begins to deteriorate when the spaceship computer announces that they are being locked on.

The pilot then calls for our main protagonist, Cain, to enter the scene.  Cain, who is sleeping wakes up when his computer generated holographic blue cat jumps on him.  Have you ever heard of a cool protagonist or anyone cool who owns a pet cat?  How about a blue holographic cat?  Well Cain is that kind of protagonist.  I will never understand how a holographic image is capable of waking someone up because they are merely projections and cannot interact with real things or people.  Cain then proceeds to the cockpit and stops the missile attack on his ship with literally the press of a button on the dashboard.  Nope, there is no explanation.  Dialogue between the two then occurs at a slow enough pace where they can look off camera in between shots/camera angles to read their lines.  Cain claims he upgraded his virtual cat without explaining how or why.  Being how the cat won't stop meowing in every scene I will say that he probably improved its ability to meow by 20%.

I realize this review is over 1000 words at this point and grow tired of reliving this movie with you so I will wrap it up.
Following a 3 minute long landing sequence a number of things interesting observations can be made.  The dress code in the future is very diverse.  Cain The Clone Hunter wears a poets shirt, under a trench coat with cargo pants and black rain boots while his side kick wears a utility workers jumpsuit, a WWII pistol belt, and a modern day empty and unclipped knee high pistol holster.  She also wears glasses which is something that should be obsolete by the year 2500.  The acting in this movie can be outperformed by B-movie 80s action characters like  Snake Plissken from Escape from New York and Escape from LA.  Every scene in this movie is filmed in someones basement or a storage facility after hours. These 1222+ words only describe events in the first 11 minutes in the movie. I assure you that the remaining 1 hour and 14 minutes are equally as memorable.  If you want to make fun of something then sure watch it for 10 minutes.  If you want to get a confession out of someone make them watch it for 30 minutes.",1480204800,,7115,4.54160125588697

4370558,2,B004FN25Y2,"This is a micro-budget sci-fi film set in a distant future wherein the rich can extend their lifespans indefinitely by implanting their consciousness into clones.  Sometimes, though, these clones go rogue.  And apparently sometimes these clones mutate and gain pyrokinetic powers.  Our Chaotic Good protagonists (a man, woman, and a holographic cat) are hired by a plutocrat whose clone is threatening to usurp his power and take over a planet.  The plot sticks to genre conventions for the most part, and it remains steady -- not a lot of highlights, but not a lot of lowlights.  5/10.

The acting is mostly decent, with Angela Funk providing a surprisingly good performance as the female lead.  (She also is called upon to perform a totally gratuitous nude scene that did nothing to advance the plot, but for a film that spends a good chunk of its runtime in an interstellar brothel, there is surprisingly little nudity and no sex.)  Be warned that there are a few lines that come out a little clunky.  Still, the acting is 5/10.

I'm not afraid of watching low-budget indie films, but there are times when the director makes decisions that break your ability to suspend disbelief.  The backgrounds and sets are generally fine (and occasionally even beautiful).  Even the man-sized robot looks pretty good.  But it falls apart a bit during action sequences.  Laser blasts end in MS Paint-level explosions, and a chase scene on hoverbikes looked so bad (in part because of editing, but mostly because of the poor effects) was so bad that my viewing companion wouldn't sit through the rest of the film.  The lead female character's bionic hand, is also pretty bad.  And did I mention that this futuristic society has landline telephones?  The effects are 2/10.

The bottom line is that this film is watchable, but only if you movie's plot, dialogue, and acting are as good as some of the original films that you'll see on the Syfy Channel.  The difference is in the budget.  If you're the type of person who can't stand bad effects (or if you can't imagine visual effects *worse* than an original Syfy movie), you should consider this a one-star movie and stay away.  But if you're willing to roll through that problem, then there are some good things here.

On an unrelated note, the production company has a rather... unique signature in the opening and closing credit sequence.  Don't worry -- it's not necessarily indicative of what's to come.",1420329600,,2447,4.843373493975903

Can we get stem cells from animals that will eventually help humans?  Cloning an Einstein may not render a person who wants to go into physics when they are adults.
