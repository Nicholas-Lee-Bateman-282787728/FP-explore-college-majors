4327955,3,B004CQZF8U,All the movies are OK.  Company Business was a real disappointment.  Eye of the Needle is the best of the three.,1393804800,,112,4.285714285714286
4327956,3,B004CQZF8U,"The eye of the Needle is very dated and has a lot of errors but a watchable movie that I had seen years ago. Worth a watch is about it.

Gorky Park is a great movie and William Hurt handles his part with excellence, whilst I saw this years ago, it stands the test of time and a great movie.

Company business, tired plot but well executed by Gene Hackman who I enjoy in just about anything he does. An afternoon  movie but that's all.

4327957,2,B004CQZF8U,"All three movies in one DVD is cool, but Eye of the Needle did not play through. It stopped at the same place each time and the other two did not. Lame to not check items for sale, especially if rated used, in excellent condition. Would be an excellent deal, but not if it doesn't work!",1364083200,,286,4.125
4327958,4,B004CQZF8U,"I bought the DVD to watch ""Eye of the Needle"" after reading the book by Ken Follet. The movie is good and suspenseful--worth watching, but doesn't tell half the story. The movie version focuses on the lustful affair and diminishes the intriguing spy story that it is. The movie has great themes of patriotism and survival. It has some gory scenes.

""Gorky Park"" also has gory scenes.  (None of these movies are for kids.) I found that ""Gorky Park"" has very intriging characters.  The movie haunted me for a couple of days whiie I pondered its themes of freedom and sacrifice.

Have not watched ""Company Business"" yet.",1348617600,4,617,4.738317757009346
4327959,2,B004CQZF8U,"OMG - Love the movie Eye of the Needle which is why I bought this set.  Gorky Park is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  If you can find Eye of the Needle just by itself, buy it.  Then you won't be tempted to watch the others that come in the set.  You will never get those two hours of your life back!",1339372800,,310,3.6515151515151514
4327960,4,B004CQZF8U,"Loosely corralled under the banner of 'suspense,' this (currently discontinued) collection of genre castoffs is a real bargain-bin treasure.  Included are:

'Eye of the Needle' (UK, 1981) - Director Richard Marquand ably captures the dark romance and intrigue of Ken Follet's page-turner in this brooding, well-textured WWII spy thriller.  An icy Donald Sutherland and the picturesque Scottish sea- and countryside keep our attention when the action lags a bit.  4 stars.

'Gorky Park' (1983) - The cast (William Hurt, Ian Bannen, Lee Marvin, Brian Dennehy), the setting (a bleak Russian winter-- shot in Finland), and the story (a murder-mystery complicated by internal and external cold-war politics, with some sharp dialogue scripted by Dennis Potter) are the excellent parts the sum of which this occasionally plodding film doesn't quite add up to.  Director Michael Apted steps all over himself trying to decide which elements of novelist Martin Cruz Smith's complicated plot to focus on (or even what kind of accent to give Hurt's Moscow cop-- we end up with ersatz-English, apparently to match all the other Brits playing Soviets).  Engaging, nonetheless.  3 1/2 stars.

'Company Business' (1991) - A lightweight but enjoyable almost-post-Glasnost (you get the feeling the screenplay was reworked hastily during production to try to fit world events) spy-actioner featuring Gene Hackman playing his rogue-CIA-agent version of Gene Hackman with the usual unfaltering relish.  In terms of plausibility, well, director Nicholas Meyer never stops long enough to wonder if things make complete sense (and, in fact, by the time CB hit theaters there was no more USSR), but it's a swift ride, and one you won't mind going on again when it's over.  3 stars.

As another reviewer notes, this TGG release contains one single-sided disc (which translates to noticeable data-compression-related pixelation in certain scenes) and no extra features.  EOTN is presented in letterbox format (same transfer as the 2000 MGM release), while GP and CB are anamorphic widescreen; and although there are no major picture or audio problems, all three movies could use a thorough restoration.  Provided you get it at the right price, a solid 3 1/2-star recommendation.",1337904000,6,2251,5.3760683760683765
4327961,5,B004CQZF8U,"These are all three classic films, suspense, and you won't be disappointed.  I hadn't seen them in a long time and I liked them just as much the second time around.",1335484800,,164,4.290322580645161
4327962,3,B004CQZF8U,"Since all films are shoehorned onto one side of the disc, there is no room for at all for extras, scene selection, or even picture quality. When it loads, you choose which film you want to watch and there you go. Gorky Park picture quality is godawful, but Needle isn't terribly bad. I doubt I'll ever watch the third film.  For the price it's great to have Eye of the Needle at all",1325808000,5,382,4.232876712328767

8423369,3,B004CQZF8U,"I purchased this mainly for Eye of the Needle. Even though I realize that the movie was made with 35 years ago technology, I was a little disappointed with the resolution; also I noticed that there was a short, unessential scene that appeared to be missing compared to the version I saw on PBS. I wondered if other scenes were ""trimmed"" in order to fit 3 movies on one DVD. No menu other than to select one of three movies; no closed caption option,etc.",1473120000,,453,4.404761904761905

8423372,3,B004CQZF8U,"Two great movies and one mediocre, which would be as good as one could expect for the price.  However, the quality of this DVD is really bad.  I have VHS versions of both ""Eye"" and ""Gorky"" that are better.  There are horizontal lines through the picture mixed with pixelated outlines on all of the faces as well as on the edges of any prominent feature in the frame.  It distracts horribly from the beauty of the landscape in ""Eye"" and in the outdoor scenes in ""Gorky""  Save your money and buy the individual DVDs.  Give this one as a gift to those who still have a tube type TV.",1448841600,,579,4.26605504587156
