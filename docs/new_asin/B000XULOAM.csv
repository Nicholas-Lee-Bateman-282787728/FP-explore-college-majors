3008267,5,B000XULOAM,"I'm already bias towards Gin.  I think she is an excellent instructor and I have almost all her videos, even the Reebok series.  This video makes for a very good toning workout.  I was definately sore the next day using only ""medium"" weights (5 lbs and 8 lbs).  This workout allows room for growth by letting you chose the weights you're most comfortable using.  There's not a bunch a jumping around and swinging the weights.  Gin takes her time and lets you feel more of ""the burn"".  There is some over explaining but if you're a long-time home video exerciser, you can proceed working-out while Gin is explaining.  It wasn't a big distraction for me.  This is comparable to Cathe or Jari Love.",1198886400,16,695,4.585365853658536

8229826,5,B000XULOAM,"I am very happy with this strength workout.  I have followed Gin since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Reebok-Aerostep-VHS/dp/6303343775/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Reebok: Aerostep [VHS</a>], so I am very familiar with her work.  I am 49 and I am able to get through the segments using between 10 to 17.5 weights, depending on the exercise. With the squats, I'm using 25. I do get tired, but Gin makes me want to keep going.  I love it!  I've been using some of the more popular strength training systems from that popular website that I will not name here.  This circuit is just much better and the results are much faster.  Sorry Beachbody, oops, I said it anyway :)",1312588800,6,721,5.45045045045045
8229827,5,B000XULOAM,"This is a really good workout for building muscle and strength.  It hits every major muscle group and I have seen amazing results.  It also familiarized me with strength training, as I was always a cardio junkie.  Now I'm hooked.  I just love it!",1258070400,5,246,4.5227272727272725
8229828,4,B000XULOAM,"Overall this is a pretty good strength training video.  I felt like there were some exercises missing and it focused a lot on biceps, for example.  Still, I've put it in my rotation and will use it fairly regularly.",1238025600,2,215,4.487179487179487
8229829,5,B000XULOAM,"My wife and I like to exercise together and she likes to do video workouts.  The only one I could ever stand was one of the old Reebok step tapes.  So my wife suggested we get some other Gin Miller videos.  We got this one and Simply Interval.  I really like these.  I stay motivated, don't get bored, and feel like I am actually getting results, as opposed to other videos that just made me feel like I was flopping around pointlessly.  Several of my muscle groups are feeling noticeably tighter and firmer after only a few weeks.  We will definitely buy more of her videos so that we can vary our workouts even more.",1236816000,7,618,4.321739130434783
8229830,5,B000XULOAM,"This is my first Gin Miller video.  I loved it.  I have been doing it just about every other day since I received it because it puts my other strength videos to shame.  I can tell that the muscle tone in my arms is improving.  I do the video with two hand-held weights (15 pounds each) rather than the weight bar.  I also feel this workout in my legs for days afterwards and I am an avid runner.  It's a tough video to do but well worth it.  If you like a hard workout, this is for you.",1214179200,7,486,3.8979591836734695
