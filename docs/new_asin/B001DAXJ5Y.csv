I've used this for three days and feel like i've made excellent progress. I was going to get professional lessons but with the product i feel i don't need them at the moment. I'm only half way through DVD 1 out of 3 and my friends are stunned at my progress.

I recommend this product to any beginner drummers who love Christ and want to worship God with drums.

It's exciting learning drums with this.",1265414400,,476,4.266666666666667
