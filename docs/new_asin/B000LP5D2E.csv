2711753,2,B000LP5D2E,"I just saw this movie, and yes, I am a little late.  But overall, I wasn't impressed.  I feel like I've heard all this before and the movie didn't add much to my knowledge about the difficulties of living in Iraq post war.  Of course life is hard there and people are being killed.  One scene shows women talking about the Americans shooting outside of the mosque and coming into the women's prayer area.  I feel their pain as I watch, but overall I found the movie to be a bit disjointed.  You get brief scenes of American military making plans for the election process, scenes of UN election supervisors, and you follow a doctor/candidate throughout his country.  There is no narration.  The movie just keeps flipping from one scene to another.  If a person doesn't know much about the war or war's effects on people, perhaps this is worthwhile.  For me, it didn't add to my knowledge of the true face of the war.",1300579200,,915,4.490909090909091
2711754,5,B000LP5D2E,"It is sad, especially if you have lived in Iraq years ago, in the ""good old days"".  What we see in this documentary is what's left over from old Iraq.  I used to compare Baghdad (before 1990) with Chicago or any other major city here in the US.  Iraqis, especially the Baghdadis are not less than any other Americans, high quality life and way of thinking.  They enjoyed rights and benefits we dream to enjoy here in the US; women enjoyed most of these rights and they were one of the happiest nations, I witnessed.  What I saw in this film is what we and our foreign strategies created in this beautiful country.  We uprooted this country from all its beauty and historical authenticity and genuineness by the name of democracy.  Yes, I recommend this movie, but please look beyond the spoken words.",1235779200,10,800,4.5524475524475525
2711755,5,B000LP5D2E,"Laura Poitras is a very brave lady that has put together a very intimate and brilliant documentary of post invasion Iraq. This doco follows the daily activities of a local Dr. Riyadh and his family leading upto the local elections. The personal struggle of this man together with his frustrations and his hopes and dreams for his family and country are very beautifully depicted and most people would be able to empathize with. The total chaos that reigns in the background is very hard to not miss. Personally I found the portrayal of the whole situation on the ground in Iraq to be very disturbing. I can only imagine what it is like for the average Iraqi, allied troops, UN mediators, contractors and diplomats etc who have to deal with this horror on a day to day basis. Even today many months after the actual events of this doco I fear the situation is no better and if anything maybe somewhat worse. I thoroughly recommend this to any viewers interested in the current events of the region. It is a fair portrayal of the country and history without any political bias. Five stars from me!",1191801600,9,1095,4.62051282051282
2711756,5,B000LP5D2E,"Given more recent events in Iraq, this wonderful documentary is already somewhat dated, made as it was during the months leading up to the first democratic elections in that country, but it marks an important moment in history as well and deserves a viewing for that reason alone. The central figure, a medical doctor in a Baghdad neighborhood, Dr. Ryadh is a member of a Sunni party, running for election to the country's new parliament. Tenacious in his commitment to his community, he is pulled in many directions by the needs of his patients, his prospective constituents, his friends and family. His story is played out against a background of continuing gunfire and explosions and an unending stream of complaints from those who have lost faith in the American presence and hope for the future. In one sequence a colleague's son is kidnapped for ransom by insurgents, and we watch as the father despairs of ever seeing him alive again.

Meanwhile, cameras visit other parts of the country, including Kurdistan, where anti-Sunni and pro-American opinion prevail. We also follow the months of behind-the-scenes preparation for elections and the precautions taken by contracted security firms, with commentary by international election observers. Branded by some as a ""show"" for the benefit of the White House and boycotted by Dr. Ryadh's own Sunni party, the election draws long lines of voters anyway, and we watch with appropriate amazement the risks voters take to participate in a process that is taken so lightly in the West. Assembled in a way more akin than most documentaries to the ideals of cinema verite, the film has no narration and leaves it to the audience to interpret much of what it is viewing. A fine and important work.",1177200000,25,1743,4.989690721649485
2711757,4,B000LP5D2E,"""My Country, My Country"" is an opportunity to see Iraq through the life of an Iraqi doctor and his family. The camera perspective is personal and I felt as though I was right there with Dr. Riyadh. The airborne scenes and the country vistas complimented the intimate nature of the coverage of the people involved.

The consequences of the American occupation of Iraq are complex. The politics are complex. I didn't feel imposed upon by some moral message, but rather felt I had a chance to see the depth and interrelationship of viewpoints that allowed me to think for myself. This movie did not clear a lot up for me, but rather gave me a sense of familiarity with the people - a chance to see them as real people and not abstractions. I felt empowered by a far more unprocessed opportunity to gather information for thought.

I wholeheartedly recommend seeing ""My Country, My Country"" to people whose understanding of ""Iraq"" comes from nightly news reports or newspaper articles. I believe this documentary is an outstanding way to learn more about the circumstances of recent Iraqi history.",1177027200,19,1093,4.839572192513369

2711763,5,B000LP5D2E,"This powerful, but understated documentary traces events in the run up to the first Iraqi [post U.S. Invasion] election. It focuses on a Sunni doctor who is running for a seat on the Bagdad city council. Poitras' technique is to have the camera follow events, giving the film drama and suspense. I felt that the film gave me a more intimate sense of what it was like for Iraqis in those days than anything I have seen. It also adds a dimension to the news of today's news from there.",1414540800,3,483,4.377777777777778

2711765,5,B000LP5D2E,"I won't lie.  I purchased this movie because Laura Poitras claims that it was responsible for putting her on a severe watch list with the U.S. government.  Yet, the movie isn't that subversive.  It follows the life of a doctor who stresses himself out by running for political office, taking care of his large family, and dealing with the danger of U.S. occupation during the early 2000s.  What I found most compelling about the story was the inside view of Baghdad during this time period.  I actually didn't find the politics of the movie to be overly strong, but it is certainly worth watching to show a different side of U.S. occupation in Iraq.

Lastly, the music is fantastic.  It was created by an eminent Iraqi musician.  It was almost worth watching just to hear the beautiful score.",1413763200,7,792,4.688405797101449

2711771,4,B000LP5D2E,"I found this a bit too political for my tastes.  It is related to the Edward Snowden affair and to the Bush presidency. I personally am not that much of a follower of politics, although I try to be an intelligent voter.  There seemed to me to be a sub-text which I could not sgree with Others may like it very much, but their appreciation of this film will depend on their own political points of view.",1400198400,,402,4.207792207792208

2711773,5,B000LP5D2E,"This documentary is so very moving.  We take for granted how easy it is to vote in the U.S.  So many of us just stay home on election day.  Look at what the Iraqis had to go through and risk just to vote in an election that was dubious at best.  After all they are suffering, they play and joke and enjoy and love each other, even as the bombs are being dropped and gunfire can be heard in the very near distance.  A scene that really hit me was when they were trying to swat a fly as booming was heard in the background.  The words to the song, as the film showed the voting, made me cry: ""My country, my country, May you have a happy morning.  Reunite everyone, heal your wounds. I yearn to see you smile some day.  When will sadness set you free?  Oh my country.""  How they have the courage to go on under these circumstances (no electricity, constant violence, fear, death, destruction, kidnapping and extortion) is nothing short of a miracle of the human spirit.",1385424000,6,967,4.263736263736264

2711776,3,B000LP5D2E,"Dr. Riyadh al-Adhadh is a Sunni physician also running for local office in Iraq.  In this documentary, we are with Dr. Riyadh as he treats patients, meets prisoners, interacts with his family and friends, and runs for office.  We also see American soldiers and contract mercenaries preparing for the Iraq general elections.

The overall impression is a troubled and dreary place, with residents having to sort out who to believe, and religious categories affecting so many aspects of daily life.
