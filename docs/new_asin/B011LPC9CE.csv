7334527,4,B011LPC9CE,"""Arthur & George"" is a three-part television period mystery made for Britain's ITV in 2015, based on the historical novel of the same name by Julian Barnes. The story is based on a real-life episode in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Victorian era's most famous fictional detective, shortly after the death of his first wife Mary Louise, took up the cause of an Anglo-Indian solicitor named George Edalji, who had been convicted of mutilating livestock in the village of Great Wryley, while he protested his innocence. The case was significant for its role in the creation of England's Court of Criminal Appeal and for Conan Doyle's active participation in investigating the crimes years after the authorities had satisfied themselves that George Edalji was the culprit. The television production does not adhere strictly to the book or to the real case, whose resolution was less certain than in the fictional tellings.

In 1907, released after serving three years in prison for the mutilation of a pony, George Edalji (Arsher Ali) appeals to Sherlock Holmes' creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Martin Clunes) for help in clearing his name, so that he may resume his practice as a solicitor. He sends Conan Doyle a packet of newspaper articles about his case. Wracked by guilt over his emotional infidelity to his late wife, eager for redemption, Conan Doyle happily agrees to meet with Edalji, who impresses him as innocent from the start. With much enthusiasm, Conan Doyle sets out to investigate the case with the help of his secretary Alfred Wood (Charles Edwards). Aided by the Edalji family, forewarned by the judge who sentenced Edalji and believes in his guilt, Conan Doyle throws himself into the investigation. And he begins to receive letters written in the same mysterious hand as some that threatened the Edalji family years before.

This is a dark, atmospheric period mystery. Costumes and production design look great. It follows the conventions of mystery novels of the period. Wood is Conan Doyle's ""Watson"", though, in a twist, he may be more open-minded about the case than his employer. The story is an odd one and embellished from its real-life inspiration, but the film keeps the audience guessing as to the identity of the guilty party. Wood represents the audience's changing opinion and concern that Conan Doyle might be on the wrong path. It touches on immigration issues in its depiction of George, son of a Parsee vicar who married an Englishwoman and took on an essential role in his English village, constantly harassed for his ethnicity, though it's not clear if this had anything to do with his conviction. It doesn't break any new ground, but ""Arthur & George"" is entertaining and brings an old case new attention.",1443225600,9,2757,4.991304347826087
7334528,4,B011LPC9CE,"This was highly watchable, but it should have been brilliant.  A period drama, a mystery, and Sherlock Holmes (sort of) gave the series all the elements it needed to be spectacular.  Script a bit plodding and unfocused.  Clunes is stellar.  George and his family might as well be cardboard cutouts.  Still, very entertaining on many levels.",1442880000,9,340,5.0
7334529,2,B011LPC9CE,"This dvd is misleadingly marketed. The box says it is ""the U.K. edition"" and runs for 180 minutes.  It may or may not be the U.K. edition but rather than running for 3 hours, it has 3 episodes of about 47 minutes, making it nearly 40 minutes short of 180.  The first episode is slow moving and ponderous, although the pace picks up by episode 3.  I give it 3 stars for content, with one star deducted because of the misleading marketing.",1442707200,27,437,4.304878048780488
7334530,5,B011LPC9CE,"This DVD contains the three episodes of the show that are being aired on PBS but were originally created for the British commercial TV network ITV (as compared with the BBC). PBS is airing the show the first week of September and the DVD will be released on September 15th (2015). I was provided an advance screener for an objective review.

The mini-series is based on a book with the same title which, in turn is based on the true story of detective author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ( creator of Sherlock Holmes) and his fanaticism with trying to solve the case of grizzly animal killings in the English Midland in the early 1900s. The suspect was an Anglo-Indian (Persian he says in the film) who served three years in prison. Sir Arthur believes he is innocent (and it matters now because the young man wants to practice law.). So Sir Arthur takes off to the country with his secretary (think Dr. Watson), Alfred Wood. The plot has a lot to do with not only possible police corruption but racism that was rampant even in the early 1900s.

There is a side story about both Sir Arthurs sickly wife and his possible mistress. But the crux of the story is Will Sir Arthur find the real killer?.

Each episode begins with a warning that some scenes may not be suitable for all audiences. This is mostly due to the graphic violence and there are some four letter words too. The package doesnt say it but Amazon lists as the U.K. Edition. I don't know if this is same version shown on PBS but the packaging is a bit misleading. It says that the three episodes run a total of Approx. 180 minutes. This would be true if they were hour-long episodes but the first two run 47 minutes and the third 48 minutes for only 142 minutes. Remember that ITV includes commercials, so this probably is the UK edition but it is 18 minutes shorter than the package states.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I found the story fascinating and, I honestly think it is best seen as one viewing rather than in separate chapters. (and there are no recaps at the beginning of each part) But you can decide for yourself.

If you are a big fan of Sherlock Holmes films (or books) youll get some extra joy from the side jokes (like having Sir Arthur have to disguise himself on a train or constantly being asked to sign copies of his books..

As I said in my title, I don't think I provided any spoilers in this review (I hate them). All the facts I noted above are revealed within the first 3 minutes. Ill leave it to you (along with Sir Arthur) to decide who slashed the animals.

By the way, I had no problem understanding the accents but the DVD does come with English subtitles as an option.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7334534,5,B011LPC9CE,"After hearing the producer discuss the book, I read it. Although a long book, I felt this production took from the book the important elements of the relationship of the two main characters and also the love story.
Martin Clunes did an excellent job of bring Sir Arthur and his quirkiness to the screen.  He is a very versatile actor. The scenes in London were an added element to make this a very enjoyable show. Well acted, directed and produced, I am glad I own both the book and the movie.",1458432000,,493,4.417582417582418

7334545,5,B011LPC9CE,"Martin Clunes is spot on in his Doc Martin role. I had to see if this new Masterpiece Mystery (produced by Clunes real wife) was on the same par. IT IS! Clunes proves his excellent in mystery drama as well as the Doc comedy/drama. Hes helped by a great associated cast: Hattie Morahan (Bletchley Circle); Emma Fielding (Cranford); Alan McKenna (Belle) and more.
Masterpiece delivers!

Its easy to compare this with Doc Martin, both good. For instance Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Clunes) grieves his wife Louisas death. Docs wife is Louisa too. Doyles snapped out of despair by investigating a wrongly convicted vicars son & solicitor of part India nationality. Some mannerisms are comparable, even in his shoulder caped coat. Doyle uses his man, Woodie (Charles Edwards Downton Abbey Philomena) and sleuths the old case as though he were his book protagonist, Sherlock Holmes. He ruffles the feathers of society and Constabulary. A fun, engaging mystery, peaked with intrigue and an action, thriller finale.

SDH SUBTITLES
for all 3 episodes that ran about 48 minutes each. I have seen different listings on the internet with a slightly different cover photo including a gold bottom band stating it was the FULL UK VERSION. No bonus in this DVD.
Sets, historic detail, costumes, and cinematography help make this mystery one to own and watch multiple times. History has met fiction in a most entertaining way.
I learn more about the author, Doyle, English history, and gained new respect for Clunes acting in historic drama. Would love to see him do more like this; but not give up on Doc Martin.",1448409600,,1592,4.936567164179104
7334546,5,B011LPC9CE,"Great film! A masterpiece. Ive watched it six times already. The acting was phenomenonal, casting was solid, the story was intriguing. I couldn't have asked for better entertainment. I want to watch it right now. Buy this one its a gem.",1447372800,2,236,4.780487804878049

7334548,5,B011LPC9CE,"Martin Clunes is really good in this.  If you have only watched him as ""Doc Martin"" you are in for a surprise.  This movie is based on a true event in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used the methods of his fictional Sherlock character to solve what seemed to be a racially based injustice and wrongful conviction.",1447027200,,311,4.43859649122807
7334549,5,B011LPC9CE,"We normally like all Masterpiece shows which are on PBS and created by the BBC.  This is another one we really enjoyed.  A little tale about the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle solves a mystery.",1446854400,,213,4.578947368421052
7334550,5,B011LPC9CE,"An engaging semi-historical look at the creator of Sherlock Holmes as he deciphers a ""Holmesian"" case in real life.  Gripping in it's own way.",1446768000,,142,4.916666666666667
8724553,4,B011LPC9CE,"The presentation is fine. The problem I had is Sir Arthur was a b-i-g man and Martin Clewn is not. He's not a small man, but Conan Doyle was truly a big man and I'm sure that there are other actors who could have been better options.
Other than the size factor, it may actually have gotten 5 stars. Unfortunately, ACD having been portrayed by ""normal"" sized people too often so that it bothers me.
I actually appreciate Martin as an actor.",1534204800,,439,4.365853658536586

8724556,5,B011LPC9CE,"What a well done film!  Martin Clunes is fantastic!  Only one or two four letter words.  Only one kiss scene between a betrothed couple.  Some animal gore, a body hanging from a tree, a man falling to his death, and one fighting scene. (this was spread out over the entire 3 hours)  I would let my teens watch this.  We had fun guessing  'who did it' the entire show.",1482796800,2,367,4.231884057971015
