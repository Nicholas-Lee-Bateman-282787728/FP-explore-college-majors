It showed me how two bicycle makers had the understanding to make control systems, a crucial component of airplanes, lacking in the European models.

As a bike rider, I have to lean into the turns, and so does a flying machine.

This program only mentions the Wrights peripherally, but their earlier efforts influenced the Europeans markedly, especially the search for control systems.

Highly recommended.",1368662400,,423,5.268656716417911
8047326,5,B0007GP7AK,"NOVA: A Daring Flight (2006) - David Ogden Stiers (narrator)

In 1909, French design engineer and aviation pioneer Louis Blriot's eleventh model aeroplane was the first to successfully cross the English Channel. This historic 37-minute flight made his single-wing craft the most popular consumer plane of its day.

Nearly a century later Blriot's grandson attempts the same feat in an original Model IX but splashes into the Channel within sight of the shore he'd just departed from.

In fairness, he was not a seasoned pilot and the Blriot IX is skittish under the best of conditions. The monoplane is unstable in strong wind gusts and can be easily blown off-course, a problem the elder Blriot encountered just before rough-landing on a chosen spot beyond Dover's cliffs.

The included 100-year old film clips and photos are marvelous and inventor Louis Blriot's story most fascinating, well-written and skillfully narrated by Mr. Stiers. A DARING FIGHT is definitely worth seeing, more so for those interested in early aviation history.",1273276800,6,1039,5.240963855421687
