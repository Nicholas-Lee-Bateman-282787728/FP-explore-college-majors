7964583,4,B000068TP1,"As a parent this video gave me a whole day of things to do.
First we watched the tape. The kids were rapt with attention.
Then we tried out the magic tricks that are taught inside the tape.
We kept going back to the dvd to see if we were doing them the right way.
This video has 5 or 6 really good magic tricks that this magician teaches you. It's not corny stuff.
Plus, there's a wacky and wild storyline about a kid who helps a good hearted wizard defeat evil.
My kids ate it up.
For the price this is definitely worth it for the tricks alone.
Try it.",1034208000,2,553,3.990990990990991
