8446067,5,B004X60QVU,I came across this watching movies from amazon.  It was free and I have always loved tales from the crypt and creep show.  Plus I have a love for low budget horror films.  I LOVED this one.  I thought the story's were great.  I have watched it many times and finally found it for sale.  Very excited to add this to my collection.  Well done!  Hope they do more!!!,1485388800,,363,4.159420289855072
8446068,5,B004X60QVU,"This is one of the best indie Horror anthologies I've seen & Im a huge fan of anthologies, Hammer, Amicus I think Made the best, then you have Creepshow & others, But as far as Indie Check this one out, other great ones are Nightmare Alley, Slices of Life & Anything by Scarlet fry.",1428883200,,282,4.2407407407407405
8446069,2,B004X60QVU,"Drive-In Horrorshow is a horror anthology that doesn't work. It makes Creepshow 2 look like Creepshow 1. There are five tales contained within, only two of them of any worth. ""Pig"" is the first tale. It reminded me of torture porn. That's not a good thing. Next we have ""The Closet"", which actually had some cleverness. It wasn't great or anything, but it wasn't bad either. The third tale is called ""Fall Apart"" and it is bad. Very boring. ""The Meatman"" has very little meat with annoying child actors who suspect that their father is a serial killer, and they even call him a murderer at some point. They deserve a spanking for that. Finally, there is ""The Watcher"", which is pretty much a basic slasher story that reminded me of Friday the 13th crossed with Wrong Turn. It's the best of the bunch, and has some great gore and a scary killer. There are also some lame interruptions between each story, with a Drive-in host trying to be funny. He fails. Actually, with a title like Drive-In Horrorshow, you would expect some big laughs and fun. But all of the stories take themselves way too seriously. The only time I laughed while watching Drive In Horroshow was during ""The Watcher"" when some douchebag gets his intestines ripped out, and he says to his girlfriend ""Help me!"" There's no helping that guy. Here's hoping that the upcoming horror anthology Chillerama will be better. I'm almost positive it will be. Surely, it couldn't be as bad as Drive-In Horrorshow.",1316995200,,1470,4.7015503875969
8446070,5,B004X60QVU,"For me, Drive-in Horrorshow lived up to its potential as a fun and sometimes scary B-movie late-night horror anthology. The framing story of an abandoned, haunted drive-in, run by ""The Projectionist"" was goofy and had an abundance of groaner puns, reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt. The shorts had a little more variety, many genres of horror were represented. While some of the segments are tongue-in-cheek, ""Pig"" is a serious torture segment, ""Fall Apart"" has a sci-fi vibe, and ""The Watcher"" is pretty classic slasher. It's a low budget film and it shows, but on the whole it works. They're pretty generous with the gore, and there are some shock moments, but it's more of a fun film than one that will give you nightmares, perhaps because of the segmented format. I saw it at a midnight screening with a big group of friends, and I think it would be a hit for a group movie night (which is why I bought a copy).",1310947200,7,917,4.597560975609756

Really,really enjoyed this odd little tip of the hat to film showmanship from the past.
Drive -in theatres have a look,smell,ambiance that wasn't exactly perfect,But made one feel like they were somewhere else besides home.
Many segments like : PIG,THE CLOSET,FALL APART,MEAT MAN,WATCHER-They are all different and equally scary.
The acting was really good and must admit the the difference theatre ( light hearted humor ) and feature ( at times really mean spirited) was not exactly meshed.",1309132800,2,516,5.382716049382716
