8231889,3,B000BGWEAC,Authentic and well done. But does not teach the whole dances that are performed at the end of each clip so a little frustrating if showing to students.,1379808000,,151,4.428571428571429
8231890,2,B000BGWEAC,"I paid $25 for this CD over a year ago.  I've used it a few times.  The dancers are well meaning but not very energized, and the steps are rudimentary at best.  It might be good for teachers who have never done much dance who want to show their grade school kids some African dance steps.  But the price makes it a bit out of reach for that audience.",1331596800,2,350,4.028985507246377
8231891,3,B000BGWEAC,The dances were energetic and creative. The instructor really takes time out to break each move down so that it would be easy to learn the dances.,1188518400,6,146,4.444444444444445
8231892,4,B000BGWEAC,"There isn't a lot of quality material out there to help people learn authentic West African dance.  This DVD really fills the void.  It has lively, colorful visuals, and the dances are presented clearly with a wonderful drumming ensemble.  I like how the presentation alternates between instruction and performance examples.  As a classroom music teacher, I hoped my students would enjoy working with the DVD.  In fact, they loved it, and it really brought this exciting art form to them in a fun and educational way!",1181779200,13,517,4.965116279069767
8231893,5,B000BGWEAC,"I orderred this DVD from a smaller website, so I'm glad its on Amazon now becasue I've had to track it down and buy it for two of my other friends from my African dance group!  This video has been an asset for learning and practicing dances between classes that I take from my live teacher.  Any student of world or African dancewill benefit from this DV,  I hope there will be a sequel soon!",1181779200,4,392,4.2
8231894,5,B000BGWEAC,This video was very helpful to me  -- it offers a basic foundation of what moves are involved in popular Ghanaian dances. I recommend this video to anyone who practices African dance.,1170806400,11,183,4.71875
8231895,4,B000BGWEAC,"After viewing this DVD, I found it very informative and educational. I personally enjoy learning about people's cultures and lifestyles. So learning cultural Ghanian dances, even though different, there was something fun and appealing about doing the dances as I watched. The music was upbeat and the dance moves were rhythmic and soulful. I suggest anyone who's open-minded, loves change and loves to dance.....to check this out!",1167091200,19,430,5.432835820895522
