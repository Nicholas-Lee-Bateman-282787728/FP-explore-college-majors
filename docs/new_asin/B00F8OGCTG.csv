8613149,5,B00F8OGCTG,I am not going to discuss whether or not the Jones fight is among the best I have seen.  There appears to be general agreement that it is a great fight.  What I don't understand is why several of the reviewers were unhappy with some of the lower card fights.  I thought that several of them were great.  The best of the bunch was the Alex Caceres/Rolan delorme fight.  This one went back and forth and was awesome.  The quick Makdessi knowckout was also good.  Actually they were all pretty good.  I would have given this a 4 or 5 star rating but I am trying to offset some of the ratings from the unhappy campers.,1394323200,2,614,4.232758620689655
8613150,2,B00F8OGCTG,"I agree with the previous reviewers. There was one good fight -- the main event -- but too many very dull bouts. I found myself fast-forwarding on some of these. How much time do you want to spend watching one guying lying on top of another, holding him down, not doing anything? Better to watch with Netflix. This is not one to add to your DVD collection.",1388275200,2,356,4.3283582089552235
8613151,3,B00F8OGCTG,"The only fight that is worth watching is the main event between Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson. It lasts the full 5 rounds! I cannot believe it. It is full of surprises and counter-attacks. It deservers 5 stars.
All the remaining fights are boring and waste of money. Overall, this DVD is worth 3 stars.

I am glad I watched it on Netflix because the DVD is not worth buying.",1388102400,2,379,4.414285714285715
8613152,2,B00F8OGCTG,"Typical UFC PPV these days: one great fight worth watching repeatedly, along with a bunch of duds/mediocre throw-aways.

The main event is a great fight, though I don't think it's quite as good as everyone says it is. There wasn't really one signature exchange that made my jaw hit the floor and go ""Wow, that was amazing!...Can't believe what I just saw!!""  Not a contender for ""all-time classic"" in my opinion. Co-main event is ""meh...not bad, nothing special."" Every other fight is a giant tub of R. Kelly's doo-doo butter. Couldn't give a card this watered down anything more than two stars. The powers-that-be at Zuffa have really convinced themselves that they can throw one diamond into a lump of human fecal matter and persuade the peanut-brained cretins that they're getting a great product.

I for one have no intention of going down quietly.",1387929600,3,852,4.902777777777778
