8412131,1,B00405ZL96,"The quality of the video is very poor. It is not even remastered. The DVD is purple disc looks like someone downloaded on pc and put it on dvd. and there are no special features. it is hard to hear and the pictures are blurry... cant believe warner bros didn't remaster this. i bought this just to see carole landis, her beauty. i wouldn't recommend this until warner bros releases it in a remastered version.",1460764800,5,409,4.466666666666667
