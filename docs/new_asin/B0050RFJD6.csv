4518125,2,B0050RFJD6,"We were hoping for more to help my wife and I to be better lovers.  This is a cold and clinical how-to instruction guide not a fun watch.  We are better watching light movie with ""super sex"" than this.  I can only recommend this for people who look at sex as a purely mechanical act.",1382400000,,283,4.109090909090909
4518126,5,B0050RFJD6,"First saw a version of this a decade back, of a video of a demonstration evening of a man DOing-Deliberate Orgasm--a woman with another woman helper by his side--three at the front of a small room.  While three couples watched off camera.  Sure redefined for me the whole way I was looking at love and sex and relationships at the time.  Big for me (and I've gone back to this question and answer dozens of times since) was the question from a man in the audience of six as to whether the man in front of the camera doing the doing of the woman, touching her Down There, was turned on or not.  If he had an erection.  He said: ""No. This is not about me at this moment.  This is all about her right now.""  My, my.  I thought I was all the servant in my spiritual/sexual path at the time.  And yet practicing what some call one-way touch (Pamela Madsen, Shameless)? Now this man the Doer was a true servant!  Touching a woman's sacred spot and not being aroused himself. Indeed, I got that I had a few things to learn about women and service and giving, not to mention sex and relationships.  Giving and getting were separate; or could be.

I'd been reading everything I could get my hands on back then; and dreaming of getting my Hands On, my heart on.  When I was ready.  I wanted to go at looking for enduring sexual love knowledgeably.  I wanted to be prepared in all ways connecting with a woman.  I wanted to be the best lover I could be.  I was 54 and taking on dating and finding a Soul Mate as a spiritual path.  What a delight to be given an early copy of this DVD in VHS format.  As a novice I attempted this once, this DOing exercise, with a platonic woman friend back then after one of our naked hot tub sessions; where we had a naked and yet not sexual context going.  That afternoon remains a highlight for me in my sexual development as an adult, to this day a full decade out.

How much we men have to relearn about sex, about connecting, about participating in a woman's orgasm when invited.  I remember back then wanting to find a woman who loved her body and one who was OK with that body, which included a yoni that was in Yes mode.  I wanted to find a woman who was orgasmic and OK about sex.  Watching a love prospect, soul mate candidate watch this DVD would be a great screening tool I thought then.  And, excuse me Mr. Man On Camera: I'd get turned on I'm afraid.  But, I would say that I've learned in time to not be aroused.  I call it passionate dispassion.

This DVD is worth the investment as a mind tweak alone.  What man couldn't learn a thing or two about serving rather than always being served?  What man could not benefit and  learn a different take than sex always having to be phallocentric?

I'm reading Nicole Daedone's similar work right now, Slow Sex, and just discovered the New York Times article by Ms. Brown The Pleasure Principle on Daedone's orgasmic community in SF. We have a local chapter I've just found out; so it looks like this work is going to continuing and maybe even go mainstream.  Now that would be nice.

BTW, just finished Pamela Madsen's memoir Shameless.  As a career person and mom and wife, her life was changed by passionate dispassion at the hands and heart of a practitioner or two of Body Electric and their Celebrating the Body Erotic work in the NYC area.

Full disclosure: I've not taken the time to verify if the VHS I have in my library is the exact same event and evening shown here in this DVD.  It may in fact be the work of a similar community that inspired Daedone in what she has now developed.  My VHS was produced by The Welcomed Consensus people I think. Bottom line: Changed the way I looked at sex.  Changed the way I look today at a woman's orgasm some 11 years later.  (Interesting: I just learned Daedone has a community in my town.  I shall look them up.)  Oh, and the negative review here at this site of Daedone's book?  Hmmm, that other guy?  My guess is that how you look at this work and this video is how you look at and revere the Divine Feminine; and if you are a man who loves women. I still think we guys have a lot to learn.

I've come to believe now that no man ever really gives a woman an orgasm.  He may participate in the event; but he is not the maker.  He's more like an invited guest.  Maybe not even the doer, really. This video and this concept offers more depth to the whole spiritual realm of human sexuality.  Nice.  Any guy how ever wanted some action at a soul level should watch this DVD and read these books mentioned here.",1358985600,5,4541,4.259953161592506
4518127,1,B0050RFJD6,"Oh my... the only reason I don't really regret this purchase is that I bought it used for a couple dollars and I got a good laugh out of how utterly ridiculous this production is!  It is only a few minutes long, looks to have been made in the 1980s, and doesn't provide any substantive advice or science.

Please allow me to save you the time and effort of ordering: notice how your body feels, tell your partner what you like, and tell yourself it is OK to feel good.",1333152000,17,468,4.188888888888889
4518128,2,B0050RFJD6,"This 'instructional' DVD is pretty much just fluff, and I am not talking about the ample pubic hair.  You could sum it up in two minutes: If you want to have an orgasm, both of you concentrate on it really hard, and rub her in the right place.  'now where would that be?  Duh.'  The sex scenes are clinical, the 'science' is daft, and this 'institute' -- while undoubtably a good place to work - is a front for posers and rip off artists.  I gave it two stars because it does no worse than most of the 'sex instruction' dreck out there.  And some of the couples they interviewed seemed attractive and sincere.  Wanna be a better lover?  Get a good lover.  And teach yourselves.  But don't waste your money on this.",1316822400,12,714,4.3007518796992485
4518129,2,B0050RFJD6,"The video is okay if you know little about sex and woman body. It shows you basic structure of a woman private area, where is the most sensitive area and some basic technique to turn on your partner.  If you have more than 5 yrs sex experience, you should know those things already.",1316304000,5,282,4.320754716981132
4518130,2,B0050RFJD6,"Yeah, I was not expecting porn or anything, i knew this was supposed to be instructional. however, this dvd is maybe 20 min long. You see some woman telling you some information, nothing really ground-breaking, and most of the video is a stretched out PPT presentation. There is one demonstration a few minutes long, basically the guy lubes up his partners vag and then applies pressure to the head of the clitoris. Did she really come? i don't know... she didn't breatk a sweat or really get off hard. Did they want to keep it clinical? It was like an SNL skit. ""Ok, i am going to put some lube between your legs"" he says. ""Ok, that would be great, i am really excited to have you put your hand on my Mons"" she says...  of course i am paraphrasing.
""So now is it ok if i put my hand between your legs?"" he asks again. It reminded me of when colleges told students to get clear confirmation of sexual progression.

This dvd is a waste of money. I will save you some and tell you what it is about in 2 sentences. tell your woman how hot she is lube her up if she needs it and then apply direct pressure to the head of her clit and watch her breathing and listed to her and go with it., buy the book ""she comes first"" much better.",1315872000,21,1228,4.15546218487395

8451791,5,B0050RFJD6,"All men and women in their normal senses should give a thought to the fact that both women and men have a natural sexdrive, a very strong, if not a dominant emotion. Why deny half the world's population, namely ""our"" women this healthy feeling? Babymaking is of course the true cause, but, the world has enough babies for years to come. The ""loving feeling"", however persists, and we should enjoy that feeling and make the best of it. Welcomed consensus is really on the right track, even if a bit clinical in the approach! All the best to this brave Welcomed Consensus, the future will/and shows.
