The synopsis says that a girl has committed suicide yet was able to send an email to a griendfriend explaining that she is still alive in the ""wired"". I didn't see that on first viewing.
I give Lain four stars because it tackled an interesting concepts, such as: If you can't remember someone or something, did it ever really exist? If you have a bad memory, rewrite the experience.  (I like that one because of its simplicity and consequence.)
Being the sucker for existentialism that I am, I have continued with the series by purchasing two more videos. (So far they seem much better.) That in itself should stand as an endorsement that there is something here but please be warned that it is quite a stretch to say that this particular video is enjoyable from start to finish.
The artwork takes a different approach towards the illustration of the human eye. It's not your usual stylized or usual ""anime"" type of eye. Its more round and sketchy and it took awhile for me to get use to.
The opening theme is quite infectious and the general animation, in which the animators have taken some very creative shortcuts to save money actually very cool.
The sound production was great.  Very very managed and very vreative.
If this is your first experience with anime, I would check out ""Evangelion"" or ""Ghost in the Shell"" first.",1011398400,,1461,4.69921875

It is also the most disturbing of the first 3 volumes. I would say that it is not until the middle of Layer 08 that the series fully earns its 16+ rating.  I feel it's worth saying that even after reading quite a bit about his series, I was rather shocked by some of what is in this volume.  The very last frame of Layer 09 kept me up half the night.
Bottom line -- this series really is quite remarkable.  It's incredibly original, very creepy, disturbing, and thought-provoking.  If you are patient, and like something that is a bit ""different"" and don't need everything spelled out for you, you will almost certainly enjoy this video.",991785600,4,890,4.435582822085889
7892684,4,6305583234,"is how I'd describe the entire series. If you're a fan of the abstract, and don't mind that vague feeling, I suggest you look into the series. I don't know how this ends yet- so the ending might ..., but then again, it might not. The only way to find out is to see it for yourself. Then again, it's all subjective isn't it?  - Let me just say that every time I watch a Lain episode, it gives me shivers. The animation itself is pretty surreal. Some of the long shots of Lain, or the vision-type things she sees are just trippy.",978825600,,527,4.116504854368932
7892685,4,6305583234,"Those who have purchased volumes one and two no doubt felt excited, and wanting more at the end.  The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel! Unfortunately that light is volume 4.  You still have  another tape to go.  I must say that even the weakest volume of Lain is  amazing, and I will be overly harsh about this since I am a Lain addict,  but I must say some things.  Don't expect much from tape 3.  I did, and was  let down.  Primarily this tape answers the question ""Is there a god  in the wired?"", and shows us yet another side of Lain's enigmatic  personality.  However, it seems as though at this point the series' budget  began to run thin, and the animators got a little scrapped for ideas.  Also, this volume contains sections that are just wierd for weirdness'  sake, and other sections that are nothing but photographs scrolling by with  plot points being laid out.  But the unforgivable sins this tape commits  are 1)the last episode ends seemingly mid scene and 2)The events detailed  in episodes 9 and 10 appear not to have happened by episode 11.  Now I  suppose one could justify sin #2 by saying that the whole sequence may be a  vision or something, but I still was quite confused by this gaping plot  hole. But don't get me wrong. You must buy this tape.  It's still better  than 90% of anime out there, and no series is perfect.  Most importantly,  Tape 4 is a life-changing experience. And simply for that reason alone, it  is neccesary to see volumes 1-3.  As a whole, Lain is amazing.",956534400,5,1530,4.399280575539568
