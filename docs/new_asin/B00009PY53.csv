At times, you can see him holding the camera with one hand and pushing violent jaeger-swilling punks away with the other. It's a no-frills approach and I'd like to say it was shot on a shoestring but shoestrings cost money! I'd like to think Civins shot this monster on a homeless lady's paper-bag slippers-budget.  Think Frederick Wiseman's Hospital but with all the grit of CBGB's men's room. Content-wise, it hearkens back to the simpler days of documentary yore. It's minimal, it's comical, and it's cheap. Sometimes it's very honest and real albeit drunken. Other times can be categorized as ostentatious peaks (example: the traveling punk rock circus/freak show) which makes you glad you're watching from the safety of your own home or correctional institution. I like Ryan E. Sane's description of his circus as a ""traveling biohazard"". Makes sense when you see it.",1107907200,,1028,5.011695906432749
