However there is VERY LITTLE  really enjoyable about the music.  Orchestral interludes are OK, but Blacher here - quoting from the booklet - ""decided to write a dialogue opera whose modernity was displayed in its complex rhythmic structures (ordered in 'variable meters', a serial system determining the time sequence that Blacher had modeled on Schoenberg) rather than in complex harmonies.  On first hearing it just sounded repetitive and not at all melodious.  Perhaps there was more of interest going on in the orchestra, but the recording strongly favored the singers.

I really wanted this opera to be at least pleasant.",1410393600,4,780,4.916030534351145
