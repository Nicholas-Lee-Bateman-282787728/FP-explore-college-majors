8544992,3,B009XID12Y,"NOT ENOUGH DRIFTING!!! WHAT WAS THE POINT OF CALLING IT A ""CAR"" MOVIE. IF THERE IS NO CARS JUST SOME KIDS DOING ""POWER RANGER"" KICKS AND FLIPS. OTHER THAN THAT IS WAS OK. NEVER WILL WATCH IT AGAIN BUT GOOD TO WASTE OF TIME.",1444435200,,223,4.090909090909091

8544994,3,B009XID12Y,not really about drifting but it was interesting enough that i watched the whole movie.,1416960000,,87,4.866666666666666
8544995,5,B009XID12Y,I wasn't sure what to expect since I've never watched any movies from Japan. But from the start I found myself getting caught up in the storyline. The story is set around a young man and his friends in high school. He is faced with the choice to support his friends or leave them to follow his dreams.,1362355200,,301,4.206896551724138
8544996,1,B009XID12Y,"Have you ever purchased/watched a movie based on the cover or the description, then when you actually watched it you felt ripped off because it was just terrible and nothing like the description? That's what happens here with this one. The title and description of this movie are horribly misleading.

Why? The later part of the description never happens. There is *no* drift racing in this movie.

If you are attempting to watch it for such, just flat out stop now and avoid this movie because you will not see it. My guess is this movie is just attempting for a quick Initial D or Fast & Furious cash in, hoping some people are sucker enough to purchase it.

While this movie is about a high school kid named Toshi, who just happens to be a street racer, you will see very little to no actual street racing. You'll see the same 2 short clips, throughout the movie, of a car turning a curve or two and then back to the movie itself.

Even some of the characters leave me scratching my head. What's the point of the gay yakuza type guy? A poor attempt at some humor filler. The overly obsessive big girl who has her eye on Toshi? Also a poor attempt at humor filler. They are literally the ""Jar Jar Binks"" of this movie.

I'm not even sure I can label this ""B"" movie flick.

This movie would have been an interesting manga, maybe even an interesting anime/oav but as a live action flick it is terrible.",1355702400,2,1402,4.373076923076923
