3514184,4,B001CK7OLU,"Now that bodily Matisse and Picasso have left the stage, we are free to enjoy the fruits of their friendly rivalry. How they exasperated and played off one another in their work. This documentary fills in the details. I would have liked it to go a little further. Comparing the glorious breakthrough of Matisse's old age with the cutouts and the less interesting last works of Picasso .",1358467200,5,386,4.6911764705882355

I think it is well presented, and the interviews show both painters were influenced by one another---an important communication,  and respect!",1353283200,,225,4.894736842105263

3514187,4,B001CK7OLU,"The French are not known for making great documentaries, as this eccentric but nevertheless interesting documentary shows. A Japanese, British or American production would probably have resulted in a richer, more informative and less idiosyncratic treatment of the fascinating relationship between these two great painters. Nevertheless, this documentary remains interesting and thought-provoking, and is aided by several interesting interviews with family members, friends and biographers. One doesn't learn terribly much about the art itself (some interviews with art historians would have really helped here), but one does learn something about the human dimension of Matisse's and Picasso's relationship. My wife and I both found it quite interesting and worth watching -- I just wish it included a bit more information.",1261612800,30,824,5.875
