8735826,5,B0168HCVM8,"I think it is a great version  of Tannhauser,  am a Wagnerite and I also follow the extraordinary baritone Peter Mattei. I will keep on filling my DVD library with your company. At your soon convenience send me information if you have in DVD Le Nozze di Figaro, with Mattei as the Count Almaviva  and Il Barbiere di Siviglia with Mattei as Figaro thank you. Thank you.",1527724800,,368,4.462686567164179
8735827,1,B0168HCVM8,"Tannhauser ruined by modern sets. WILL SOMEONE PLEASE PUT OUT A TRADITIONAL TANNHAUSER ON BLU RAY. It is supposed to be forests and trees, come on get with it.  How can you even possibly get into an opera if it is not set in the right time and right sets?",1490140800,4,255,4.1
8735828,3,B0168HCVM8,"This production seems to be a joke. My wife and I had to laugh out loud at the absurdity of some of the dance moves. More laughs for the clash between the modern dress and the old-fashioned libretto. On the other hand, the singing and playing is fine. So just listen and don't watch. Three stars as an average of the excellent music and the ridiculous production.",1469318400,,363,4.432835820895522
8735829,3,B0168HCVM8,"Pape and Mattei are so outstanding that for them alone I would rate this production with 10 stars! The women are fine, more Elizabeth than Venus, although nobody will ever replace Marton's emotion at the end of act 2 in the MET's production. Yet, there are some issues that made me feel disappointed with this DVD from Berlin. The ballet at the Venusberg scene is very distracting and although high eroticism is intended, the closer shot at the dancers shows clearly they are just following a well rehearsed pantomime. This gets even worse at the end of act 2... But the real disappointment here is Tannhauser himself. Despite the reasonably good voice of Seiffert - and Cassily at the MET's more conservative production - it is difficult to believe that these two men are hot enough to make both Venus and Elizabeth to be so madly attracted to him. Tannhauser, among all Wagnerian heroes, is the one that decidedly asks for the physique of a latin lover. Young, strong, handosme, hot, horny eve!. That is what we all imagine when we hear a good recording of the opera and follow attentively the libretto written by Wagner. I wonder if Kaufmann would even venture into the role,.. Until then, better stick to recordings and imagine a Tannhauser who would really let Venus mad at the idea of letting him go.",1468713600,,1306,4.707423580786026
8735830,2,B0168HCVM8,"The two stars are for Barenboim. As I always do with DVD operas from Europe, specially Germany, I play the disc first without video (TV off). The Audio is superb, the singers good and Barenboim outstanding. Then I played the disc with the TV on and once again I agreed that opera now is going nowhere, Wagnerian operas specially do not tolerate modern productions. Modern dresses, stupid prolonged dancing throughout the whole
opera,  an almost naked dancer with the pilgrims, epileptiform movements and so many other monstrosities make this production a copy of Kaufman's Lohengrin.",1466812800,6,583,5.136842105263158
8735831,5,B0168HCVM8,"GREAT PRODUCTION AND MUSIC DIRECTION.  VERY GOOD SINGERS.
PRODUCTION MORE IN LINE WITH WAGNER'S ORIGINAL OPERA'S TEXT AND MESSAGE.
DVD CAME IN TIME, AS ALWAYS.",1463529600,,159,5.36
8735832,5,B0168HCVM8,"Tannhuser is precariously balanced on the sacred and profane axis, both in its subject and in the tortured history of its productions in the musical capitals of Europe. The pure musical tradition of German song is contrasted with the decadent Grand Opera of Paris, with its focus on crowd-pleasing effects and Jockey Club-sponsored ballerinas. Wagner's theme may be redemption - his theme is always redemption - but his heart is in the spectacle. That's why I enjoyed this production so much; it turns renunciation and atonement into pageantry.

Musically this is quite outstanding. Daniel Barenboim, conducting of one of Europe's great orchestras, sets the stage for a great evening of theatre. In the overture and the introductions to Acts II and III the way that the camera pans through the orchestra, looking over Barenboim's shoulder, is as dramatic as anything on stage. When he stands to bring out a particularly thrilling phrase it's electric. The singing is really excellent as well, with a dramatically assured Peter Seiffert grounding the opera, between the two poles of slinky mezzo Marina Prudenskaya as Venus, and soprano Ann Petersen, radiant in a Grace Kelly gown, as Elisabeth. Rene Pape as Hermann, and especially Peter Mattei as Wolfram von Eschenbach are superb singers and equally good actors.

Wagner sweated bullets trying to integrate the ballet conventions of the Paris Opera into his story of Minnesingers. This production by Sasha Waltz (is there a better name for a choreographer?) is no where close to being consistently successful, but when one of her many dance or dramatic ideas works, it works big-time. The Venusberg Scene in Act I takes place within a metal tube that looks like an eye. Partially-clad dancers cavort inside, looking like something from the cutting room floor of Woody Allen's Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex, but Were Afraid to Ask. Then the lighting changes, and the scene is reminiscent of a James Bond credit sequence. But at some point things come together, and all of a sudden the scene becomes fabulously sexy and incredibly beautiful. What happened? I was just snickering a minute ago! When Prudenskaya and Seiffert come sliding down the tube, we have a moving presentation of Tannhuser's long dream of sensuality.

This is such an eclectic production, and it's all the better for it. There's a natural shift from Venusberg to the Minstrel's Hall on the Wartburg, and Waltz sets us up in a brightly lit Art Deco Hollywood set that's full of one per centers looking elegant. Here is where the integration of dance really pays off. The story of the musical competition can come across as a dullish Medieval German episode of Glee, but Waltz turns on her inner Busby Berkley, and everything sparkles. I don't know if this is deliberate, but when groups of singers and dancers stand frozen for a while, I was reminded of Alain Renais's Last Year at Marienbad. Both that film and Wagner's opera ground their drama in deeply ambiguous dream states.

Waltz abruptly shifts the tone from the bright Hollywood/Middle European spectacle of Act II to film noir in Act III, monochromatic and misty on an empty stage, and all of a sudden mystical, with Wagner's soaring choral hymn of atonement and redemption. The dancing is once again sublime. When the stage turns blood-red with the return of the Venusberg music (and the welcome return of Prudenskaya), we have a superb example of the dramatic potential of dance.

I'm so pleased that BelAir Classique makes generous clips of their productions available on YouTube. Even the short video clip will give you a good feel for the style of the production and its high musical standards, if not the final excellence of the Blu-ray disc.",1461715200,9,3738,4.983974358974359
8735833,4,B0168HCVM8,"I enjoyed this a great deal with it's simplicity.  However, 2 negatives: (1) the added dancing in some scenes was a distraction and (2) I am not a fan of Seiffert, at least not in the recording.  Every time he pushed his voice there was a major wobble.  However, the bare stage and even the dancing was most effective in act 3.

Others that I know of with the same incorrect information are the new Manon Lescaut from ROH and La Fanciulla del West from Wiener Staatsoper.",1449273600,12,670,4.442622950819672
