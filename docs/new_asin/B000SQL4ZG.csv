2889680,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Finally!  A live concert DVD from The Bangles!  Better yet, a concert at the House Of Blues in LA that I was actually at and it's just as great as I remembered it!!  The show is from 2000, so it's before Michael left and we get the original line up.  In addition to most of their classic album tracks and singles, we get a live version of their reunion song ""Get The Girl"" and preview of a half dozen or so from their reunion album (which would be released a couple of years after this show) that would be called ""Doll Revolution"".  Great new songs like ""Ride The Ride"" mix seamlessly in with their standards and the girls look and sound great.  In fact, I think they look BETTER here in the year 2000 than they did in their heyday.  As a bonus, for me, I'm in about 40 or 50 different shots of the audience, smiling and bobbing my head in time to the hooks!  Rock on, Bangles!!",1189468800,2,878,4.153846153846154
2889681,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I've been a fan since the eighties and got to see them live at the Orange County Fair 3 years ago (where they were GREAT!!!), This concert is very good too... I highly recommend it.",1188777600,2,181,4.2
2889682,4,B000SQL4ZG,A fun concert with all the original members but i agree with other reviewer that audio quality is lacking. No bottom to it and very trebly. Best way around it is to use 2.0 rather than 5.1 and not to play it too loud. The show itself is great and the band has a lot of fun reworking old and new material. You could do worse than to spend 90 minutes watching susannah hoffs who is still one of the hottest females to ever pick up a guitar. Hope they put out another dvd soon with a new sound mixer.,1188691200,,497,3.98
2889683,3,B000SQL4ZG,"Picture and sound quality of concert are very good.  Concert itself is edited for this DVD:  The songs I'm Not Talking, Ride the Ride and You Were On My Mind were omitted as well as the Waiting For My Man part from Manic Monday and the Mrs. Robinson part from Walk Like An Egyptian.  Banter between songs was edited.  Commentary by the band members (minus Michael Steele) had some good bits, but mostly anecdotes that long time fans have heard before.  The photo sections were basically photos that long time fans are already familiar with.  The interview with the band members (minus Michael Steele), while being pretty recent, covered the history of the band - again, die-hard fans should know this stuff by heart now.

If you're a new or casual fan of the Bangles, the issues I brought up shouldn't be a problem for you.",1188604800,7,823,4.595890410958904
2889684,3,B000SQL4ZG,"The Bangles live are unadulterated fun. By no means throw-away bubble-gum pop, they write and sing with such great depth of knowledge and a deft, light touch. It is a pity that the sound mix on this DVD is so thin. Vocals are fine, but guitars drum and bass sound like they are recorded on cassette tape, played on a transistor radio. All treble, no body. The contrast with Manic Monday that plays on the menu background is jolting. Much more enjoyable are the two acoustic bonus tracks and the nostalgic commentary track. I saw them live in Sydney and the ballsy muscularity of that show put the DVD recording to shame.",1188345600,2,620,4.544642857142857
2889685,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I thought the video and sound quality were excellent. Any complaints about the song performances that were left off the DVD should be overshadowed by the commentary, interview, and acoustic performance. It would be impossible to create a product that satisfies everybody - in particular the fans that want everything suited to their own tastes and expectations. For the true fan, this is a ""must have"" addition to the collection. The band, understandably, shows a little bit of rust and a broken string at one point adds to the ""raw"" feel of the concert. No overdubbing or do-overs here. ""Live"" DVDs which are a mish-mash of concerts may help bring viewers ""the best"", but often lack flow and detract from the ability to feel like you're there. No such problem here.

There's a nice mix of new and old songs including the obligatory hits (""Manic Monday"", ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" and ""Eternal Flame"" - three I could live without ever hearing again).

It's too bad that Michael Steele apparently didn't want to be involved with the commentary or interview, but fans do get to see her in the live performances - including the fantastic ""Between the Two"" on which she sings lead.

The only thing I was disappointed with was the amount of time it took to receive this DVD. What was the point of offering ""pre-ordering"" if it was going to take a week and a half to arrive? Certainly a minor blip in the grand scheme of things, but Shout Factory has dropped the ball in the distribution of this.",1188000000,3,1488,4.67175572519084
2889686,5,B000SQL4ZG,"As a child of the 1980's I was waiting for the Bangles to come out with a DVD and now there is. Lead by Susanna Hoffs on vocals, Debbi Peterson Drums, Vicki Peterson Lead Guitar, and Michael Steele Bass. I saw them live in concert in June 2007 at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and the ladies didn't disappoint that night and they surely don't disappoint on this DVD so if you are a child of the 80's like I am you will love this disc. Can't wait to see the Bangles again when they come to Tampa again.",1187395200,,495,4.061224489795919
2889687,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I am an Old School, Die Hard Bangles Fan. I have concert T shirts, Tour books, buttons, back stage passes, the two diffrent versions of ""The Bangles"" Ep (IRS and Faulty Products), and just about every bootleg record ever made. When the Bangles Announced their reunion I thought it was second coming, and when they announced that Micheal Steele was leaving the group, my heart shattered into a thousand pieces.

I went to the Bangles homepage to check out this DVD, and per their site this has the ORIGINAL line up!! So if you are a fan that still has paisly running through your blood. Then with out even seeing this DVD yet 20 songs with the original line up??? You Better believe that I am buying this one!!",1185062400,4,709,4.496124031007752
2889688,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Finally, a live Bangles DVD! Had this band been performing in the 1960s and been male, they'd be considered better than the Byrds by a mile. Unfortunately, they came out in the '80s right next to the Go-Gos (who are also a good band but without the ensemble strength) and are lumped with them as another ""girl band,"" whatever that means. The fact is that the Bangles are like female Beatles: an ensemble band of great songwriters and singers who harmonize together beautifully. Their most recent album, ""Doll Revolution,"" is outstanding. If you think all they did was ""Walk Like an Egyptian,"" you're missing out! Get all four of their studio albums and this DVD, and enjoy one of the great harmonizing pop bands of all time. Dear Bangles: Please make more new albums!!!!",1184716800,9,770,4.753731343283582

2889698,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I was excited when The Bangles released their first concert DVD Return To Bangleonia but once I got it I was a little disappointed for a few reasons.
First it was edited there where songs cut out like Ride The Ride You Were On My Mind and I'm Not Talking plus the original House Of Blues interview was not on there the acoustic version of Eternal Flame was also not on there.
I can deal with copyright reasons but come on Shout Factory could have done better than that and not be so lazy.

2889700,3,B000SQL4ZG,"Highs for the DVD include a good performance that includes a pretty well-rounded set list.  Everyone has favorites that they would have added or deleted but overall it's pretty good.  The Video is well done and the camera angles enhance the performance without intruding.

Lows include an unsatisfactory sound mix that's light on the bass and heavy on the mids.  I happen to think that Michael Steele is one of rock's underrated bassists and the light mix shortchanges her masterful playing.  Speaking of Michael, the video definitely shortchanges her as well.  Unless she's singing lead she's almost absent, and she's parked so far out in right field that wide-angle shots have trouble fitting all four in the frame.  And she's missing from the commentary and the interview.  Note to Susanna, Vicki and Debbi: Michael Steel is a Bangle, too!  Without MS you three are only 3/4 of the Bangles!

Overall I gave it 3 stars because despite the lows it's all we Bangle fans have.",1378425600,,975,4.8545454545454545
2889701,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I always liked the Bangles back in the 80's and that hasn't changed today. They were and still are a very talented band and I never get tired of listening to their many hit songs. The only complaint that I have is I wish they were still doing more music videos, but I'll take what's out there. I'm a musician in a country band and I know firsthand what a ""blast"" it is to get into a ""music groove"" with your fellow musicians. You can see the bond among the girls in the band when they're performing and the sound they put out confirms it. I hope everyone has a ""blast"" with this DVD as I have.

2889703,4,B000SQL4ZG,"For the Bangles only concert DVD, I thought the song selections were just, ok. I mainly got this DVD to watch Susanna Hoffs as she's always great to look at, but of 18 songs the Bangles performed, I only liked half the selections. I wished they had performed ""Be With You"" along with the classics they performed. And from the ""Doll Revolution"" selections I wished ""Tear Off Your Own Head"" and ""Something That You Said"" were played. Now to the hits that they did perform that I like, most weren't perform in its original way. I don't mind if a song or two gets a revamped, but not most of them. Maybe it was just me, but it sure didn't sound like they originally were. Maybe because it's performed live, or I need a few more watching to get used to. Those were my only two gripes, if it weren't for that, this would have been a 5 star rating for me. The special features are good, get to see more of Susanna Hoffs in an interview and perform a couple of acoustics.",1337731200,,963,4.26775956284153

Very happy with this DVD and enjoyed the commentary and interview with Susanna, Vicki and Debbi. Love seeing them laugh together. Unlike artists today, these girls really have talent!

2889706,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Return to Bangleonia is simply a must have for fans of The Bangles.  The music spans the career of the band from the mid 80's to their latest recording, Doll Revolution (2003).  It features some of their best songs, and captures the magic of the group live, showcasing their musicianship, and the lead and harmony vocals that are a signature part of their sound.  And since Michael Steele has left the group, this performance may be one of the last remembrances featuring the original members.

One of the pioneering all female bands in rock, The Bangles found commercial success in the 80's with their 60's influenced brand of melodic pop rock.  After producing the albums All Over the Place (1984), Different Light (1986), and Everything (1988), the group disbanded for a time, but reformed in 1999 to record for an Austin Powers film, and then eventually their first album in fifteen years, Doll Revolution in 2003.  This concert was shot in 2000 on their home turf, at the House of Blues in Hollywood.  The band has their musical stuff solidly together, the venue is great, and the ladies look fantastic while rocking out.  Joining them on keyboards is Greg Hilfman.

The vocals are an ultra-critical element, in this band where all four members sing lead.  When you put these voices together, you get something that can be really special , greater than the sum of the parts.  The intimate nature of the Hard Rock makes it an ideal venue for The Bangles, where their vocals and clean and clear guitar sounds, can really be heard.  On a small stage, with the audience literally a few feet away, the tight camera angles make you feel like you are right up at front of the stage, grooving with the rest of the enthralled audience.  It is a warm and happy place.  As the song goes `There's no place better than here right now'.

There aren't an excessive number of cameras shooting, but there are enough for good coverage and variety, and the editing is mostly well done.  The sound mix is marvelous, as you can hear the individual voices and the instruments quite distinctly.  If the bass was cranked up a bit more, it would be perfect.

The set list includes most of the big hits, and is a nice blend of the old and new.  Besides classics like `Manic Monday', `Walk Like an Egyptian', and `Eternal Flame', there is a healthy dose of material from Doll Revolution, a remarkably excellent album.  `Here Right Now' is done in a mellow groove with an acoustic flavor, while `Between the Two' features a driving beat and some infectiously jangly guitar.  The kickass upbeat version of `Stealing Rosemary' has the band humming along at full speed, while the super bouncy Beatlesque `Get The Girl', from The Spy Who Shagged Me, is another cool tune.  Some of the older material like `Hero Takes a Fall', sound reenergized and edgier live.

Unfortunately, the show is over much too soon, running about 70 minutes.  Rockers like `Walking Down Your Street', `Make a Play for Her Now' and `Different Light' would have been great additions.  Doll Revolution was a truly remarkable achievement, from which the band could have easily featured a few more songs.  Michael in particular shined on the album, and it would have been wonderful to see the haunting `Song for a Good Son' performed live, if it had been written at the time.

The DVD features some nice extras, including intimate live performances of `Manic Monday' and `Ride the Ride' featuring acoustic guitars.  Hopefully some other songs were recorded in this session, and might be available someday.  `The Story of Bangelonia' is a short interview feature with the remaining members, Susanna Hoffs, and sisters Debbi and Vicki Peterson.  It's kind of usual, but there is a commentary track for the concert, also featuring Susanna, Debbi, and Vicki, offering lots of remembrances, both on and off topic.  It's not too serious, mostly for fun, and gives you some idea about the personalities of ladies.  It's a shame The Bangles haven't been more productive when it comes to recording, but that only makes this a release to be appreciated even more.  As of this date, The Bangles continue to tour, and hopefully will release some new music soon.",1247270400,7,4193,4.779166666666667
2889707,5,B000SQL4ZG,"I have been a major fan of The Bangles and when I heard about the release of the dvd I wanted to get it since I had seen the show years before when the House Of Blues website still let people view live shows and The Bangles were one of the band's that was on the site.
When I first saw the show on the website it was awesome I loved the performance with all their hits and new songs it was so cool and when the dvd came out I was excited but disappointed that some of the songs were edited especially when they did Manic Monday they had orignally included Waiting For The Man at the end it too was also edited out.
This dvd is still enjoyable but the music market needs to stop editing out so much stuff its getting so ridiculous that I am sure other fans are also getting fed up with them.",1247097600,13,790,3.9748427672955975

2889717,3,B000SQL4ZG,"While the performance of the band was good, the sound mix, patricularly the 5.1 surround, seem a bit off. The lyrics are drwoned out in the 5.1 mix, and the 2.0 doesn't have all that much sepration. My other complaint with this DVD is that it is in non-anamorphic widescreen, even though it was shot in HD. This should have been released in anamorhpic widescreen, which would have helped it look much better on my HDTV. Instead, I am forced to watch with either bars on all 4 sides, or zoom in for a much grainier, pixelated image.",1215388800,3,531,4.428571428571429
2889718,4,B000SQL4ZG,"I have been waiting for a live Bangles concert since MTV's professionally produced broadcast of the band's December 1986 Pittsburgh performance. Even though I subsequently recorded a VHS copy of the rebroadcast live performance I was hopeful and official version would some day become available.  Alas, it has not.  Not yet, anyway.  The next best thing is RETURN TO BANGLEONIA.

The 2000 performance was filmed at the famous House of Blues and is captured from various roving cameras.  The digital recording is of superb quality.  RETURN TO BANGLEONIA is truly a professional product.  I hope that a CD version of the performance eventually becomes available.  More importantly it was great to see the Bangles together again.

I was initially wary of buying this DVD.  Some of the reviews gave rise to the belief that this was not a whole uninterrupted concert.  The cartoony-looking DVD cover only served to perpetuate my quandry.  When I finally made the purchase I was happy I did so.  The DVD is a complete performance, and then some.

The Bangles went their separate ways when the group was just about at their peak.  Following the very successful albums/CDs DIFFERENT LIGHT and EVERYTHING, the group stalled.  The greatest hits CD, very often a warning sign, and its VHS companion hit store shelves in 1990.  The Bangles went their separate ways.  It was a decade before they fully reunited for an AUSTIN POWERS soundtrack and subsequently released DOLL REVOLUTION. Unfortunately the decade break took its toll.  Marriages, families, and other important distractions ensured that the Bangles would enter the public eye at infrequent intervals.

Even in RETURN TO BANGLEONIA we are treated to some of the wear and tear on the band.  Unlike the 1980s' Pittsburgh concernt, where the gals bubbled with energy and enthusiasm, Susanna Hoffs appears to be the only member of the band truly enjoying the performance. Even Michael Steele seems more distant. Maybe this was a precursor to her hopefully not permanent departure from the band.  At the conclusion of the House of Blues concert you see her strut off stage while Hoffs and sisters Peterson group hug-bow.  It is too bad that Steele does not appear in any of the interview segments in the special features.

In watching and listening to the BANGLEONIA DVD I noted that many of the numbers were performed in a more folksy manner.  Accoustic guitars are more evident in this concert.  There is no great effort to try and replicate the sound of the original recordings.  In some ways this was a disappointment and in others it was refreshing.  In any event, the price is right and DVD is high quality.",1213315200,29,2657,4.936794582392777
2889719,2,B000SQL4ZG,"I watched this concert years ago on TV and i thought it was fantastic. It would deserve a five star rating, but its not complete. About 20 minutes of music are missing, three songs are entierly cut and two other songs are partly hacked in a really bad way. The extras are a bland run of the mill. An interview were they tell the same old stories once again, a commentary were they tell some more old stories and even the same stories from the interview. This disc also contains two songs as accoustic versions. I know there was a third but the camera was probably on Michael Steele one time too many:

My main complaint is that Michael Steele, the bassist, is hardly featured here. She isn't involved in the commentary, the interview, and only a little in the gallery. The pictures in the gallery from around the reunion days feature her exactly one time, perhaps to give the impression away she was never much involved in this reunion at all and any fan from these days knows that this is simply not true. Maybe the other three Bangles found themself prettier or whatever catty nonsense the reason was.

One of her songs (I'm not talking) is deleted, and another song (You were on my mind) where she sings lead together with the other three Bangles is cut too. Even though she was a bandmember at the time, they managed to make it look like she was hardly involved in this concert at all. There was a third song cut, but the title escapes me right now and that song was never part of the TV version either. Parts of Manic Monday and Walk like an Egyptian are deleted as well, and they did it so badly, its just hilarious. Their excuse is the good ol' ""licensing issues"" but this disease seems to beset mostly songs where Michael Steele is more featured than usual.

The remaining three Bangles (Michael Steele left in 2005 and its obvious why) seem to have an agenda to belittle Michael Steeles involvement in the Bangles and this particular concert as far as possible. Sure, they suck up on her in the commentary occasionally but it feels flat and forced as if they would read a script and who listens to the commentary of a LIVE CONCERT anyway. I found their idle chit chat about ""back in the day"" really boring and occasionally it seems they don't even know their own songs, for instance when Debbi Peterson cracks up about a specific line in September Gurls and her sister Vicki Peterson have to remind her why it was sung that way or Susanna Hoffs who doesn't recognise the intro to one of her own songs. It just made me cringe. Another low point was their 'explanation' why Michael left and given the fact that she was a member of about 15 bands make them sound like they just want to cover up themselves. Go and listen to it for yourself.

There was talk in the past about including recorded video material from the sessions to Doll Revolution and backstage stuff, but its not on this disc. Michael Steele would be on this material, and that was enough to give it the axe i guess.

If it were the complete concert without any agenda, it would deserve 5 stars, because the concert is energetic fun, and a good reminder of greater times with the Bangles, even without the aforementioned missing songs its still four stars but the agenda of Vicki Peterson, Debbi Peterson and Susanna Hoffs deserve no star at all and they show it off too obviously here. Hence, i gave two stars as a compromise.",1197936000,11,3399,4.466988727858293
2889720,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Arguably, the 80's were not the greatest period for good music, but there were some outstanding songs, some great bands and some wonderful periods. Whether you were there or not, the songs of the Bangles have filtered down now to ""classic radio"" and have become part of the mainstream. But this concert shows these four musicians/singers to be one great band with all the requisite hooks, harmony, personality, looks and charm to keep most of their material from being time-warped and restricted only to oldies shows.  The songs are still strong today (even with the exception of the overly cute ""Walk like an Egyptian"") and the new material is easily equal. With loyal keyboardist Harpo, the Bangles state their case that they weren't a formula band, not some clever marketing idea, but a real life rock and roll band. This is one enjoyable show - not perfect - just a great deal of fun, with great music from four musicians who enjoy what they do and an obviously appreciative audience.",1193875200,3,988,4.811764705882353
2889721,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Wow. I never did get a chance to see the Bangles live.  Seeing the music video on MTV or VH1 when they actually played music did the Bangles no justice!  Seeing this concert I thought how sexy the other 3 members were.  Of course I felt Susanna was always sexy.  But to actually see her in concert.  I would've thought she just stood there and sang(most bueatiful women don't have to jump around to get your attention, lol).  But to see her rock and move to all the songs played was a treat in itself.  And sexy she is.  Hearing her say she used to ""do splits on stage because she could"" was like ""Wow I wish I'ld seen that back when"".  But now years later seeing Debbie, Vicke, Michael I thought these women had a natural beauty to them that I missed.  Shame on me for only watching Susanna those years back. I can only hope for another reunion. Michael come back...",1192060800,3,867,4.263803680981595
2889722,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Well, I just got back from Bangleonia and all I can say was that I had a lot of fun there.  It's great to see the Bangles back together again and know that they are still making music.  I hope to see them live someday.

I understand some of the criticisms of this DVD, like perhaps the sound production, but the fact remains that you get a live concert, two bonus tracks -- one of their great hits plus my personal favorite song off of ""Doll Revolution"" -- and a commentary track.  So, this can be watched and enjoyed at least twice.  Oh yeah, there's some documentary footage too, and I found it worth watching since I have very little ""behind the scenes"" knowledge of Bangles history or folklore.

The commentary track is a lot of fun, and it's quite interesting and informative to hear the band members tell stories about the songs as they are played.  I enjoyed the commentary as much as the concert.

So, it's easy to nitpick, but the fun factor is certainly there, and it's about as close to a Bangles live performance as I'm likely to get.",1191456000,2,1046,4.383419689119171
2889723,5,B000SQL4ZG,"(Because of an error I chose I wasn't over 13) I'm an older Spanish fan of The Bangles (since Everything Lp) but I never have the opportunity to see The Bangles in concert (not in Spain). So, this is an incredible DVD for me. My loved Bangles are older too but they play and sing very well. They keep fit! I don't understand why we've waited nearly 7 years to see this concert (recorded in 2000), or why there's no more available Live material about The Bangles. Watching this dvd makes me wonder how they played in the past. In ""Angels don't fall in love"" Susanna stops playing her guitar to ""play"" Vicky's guitar!!!! What didn't do in the 80's? I rate this DVD with 5 because it's the first Live dvd but I would prefer to wait the Region 2 version, maybe it would have subtitles so I understand the band interview better. Thank you for the release of this DVD. I'll hope more Bangles Live concerts and, over all, a concert in Spain!!! La esperanza nunca se pierde.",1191196800,,966,4.372222222222222
2889724,5,B000SQL4ZG,"Would like to draw your attention to the band commentary which comes as a bonus feature with this disc.
I thought it was extremely informative and fun as Susanna, Vicky and Debbi talk about the concert as they and we watch it.
Especially appreciative is their heartfelt comments payed to newly departed bassist Michael Steele as we see her perform her song Between The Two.
The photo gallery included with the disc has a number of pics from the very earliest stages of the Bangles that I had not seen before and are tre cool!
And as for the concert itself filmed in 2000, it was as fresh as when I saw them a few weeks ago during the final stop on their 2007 tour at Foxwoods.
Thank God for The Bangles!",1189900800,,703,4.333333333333333
2889725,5,B000SQL4ZG,"If you are a fan of the Bangles you will love this DVD!  It is a great tribute to the band b/c in addition to the concert footage (which features the original 4 members), the bonus interviews and photos become a nice tribute to a truly original, unique group of women.  The girls still look great, sound great, and have finally produced a DVD that is a nice video scrapbook of their careers together.  Pick up a copy!",1189728000,,417,4.32051282051282
8206403,1,B000SQL4ZG,"This DVD is the biggest rip-off I've ever had!!!  It is not a straight concert...There is verbal commentary between two band members running throughout the entire music...besides this, the music is inaudible...volume level is so low it is ridiculous...I could not watch this at all...Now, it may be that my copy was defective as far as the low volume but the running commentary throughout the music is ridiculous and unforgivable...I do not understand how anyone could give this concert a positive review unless we received two completely different videos...You will be terribly disappointed if you purchase this item...Nobody could pay me enough to watch it!",1511395200,,659,5.276190476190476

8206406,5,B000SQL4ZG,Susanna Hoffs is as mesmerizing as ever. In my opinion she was always the breakout star and doesn't disappoint in this DVD. If you're a fan of hers you need to pick this up just to see her rock out. She is truly stunning.,1499040000,,221,4.045454545454546
