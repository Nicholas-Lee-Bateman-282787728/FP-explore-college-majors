7892023,5,6305545103,This forgotten masterpiece begins with wonderful folk tunes and goes on into a surrealistic frenzy with some of the most hilarious slapstick I have ever seen (you can't even imagine what happens when the livestock get into the buffet table!). The music is great too.,1260835200,,266,4.933333333333334
7892024,5,6305545103,"I heard about this movie from a friend of mine in Russia. Music in this movie was her grandfather's favorite. It's amazing to me to watch a movie from 1934 Russia that reaches into the heart of every person with happiness, joy, and comedy. It is a timeless classic.",1065139200,2,265,4.428571428571429
