8146599,4,B000IOM1TQ,"OK early 60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) horror film.  A vampire named Nostradamus, descended from a long line of vampires also called Nostradamus, targets a vampire-fighting professor and a bunch of other folks for extermination.  Seems that a loooong time back his ancestors were persecuted or something and the teether wants revenge.  With the help of his cruddy looking hunchback servant he proceeds to make life impossible for his enemies.  The end sequence has a castle with corridors that go on, it seems, the length of Mexico City.  The quality of this DVD is very good.  There are supposedly three more of these Nostradamus films: The Monster Demolisher (El Destructor de Monstruos), The Genie of Darkness (El Genio de las Tinieblas), The Blood of Nostradamus (La Sangre de Nostradamus).  As far as I know only The Monster Demolisher and The Curse of Nostradamus are available on DVD.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1423526400,3,960,5.148387096774194
