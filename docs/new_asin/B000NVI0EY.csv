2783901,4,B000NVI0EY,"When 73 year-old Teri Horton retired as a truck driver she supplemented her social security income by digging through dumpsters and scouring thrift shops. One day she bought a painting at Dot's Spot Thrift in San Bernadino to cheer up a friend who was depressed. The painting was too big for her friend's trailer, so they displayed it at a garage sale where a local art teacher suggested that it might be a Jackson Pollock original. This is not a great movie but it sure is a great story, and I will only say that the documentary does a nice job of pitting four factions against each other---the anal and insular world of self-important art snobs, forensic scientists who analyze finger prints and paint samples, the several folks who try to help Horton prove her case, and the recalcitrant Horton, who after paying $8 for the painting rejected a $9 million offer. Horton has appeared on Letterman, Leno, Montel Williams, and Sixty Minutes. She swears she will burn the painting before selling it for less than the $50 million an authentic Pollock would bring. Somehow you get the impression that this trash-talking trucker might not be kidding.",1180656000,,1145,4.817258883248731
2783902,5,B000NVI0EY,"I'm tough to please and this film held my interest all the way through, though I'll bet it's easier to enjoy on DVD (as we did) than in a theater because we found ourselves commenting, sometimes quite emotionally, about what was happening.

Without giving away the conclusion, I'll tell you only this: Teri Horton has some pretty convincing evidence--the kind a Gil Grissom would value. Forensics are changing the art world. Digital vs. Analog. Objective vs. Subjective. Evidence vs. opinion. Of course art experts are bound to disagree, to resist such changes. In the face of mounting evidence those experts find it difficult to change their minds. Their reputations depend upon them being right--the first time.

Would I sell for $2 million or even $9 million? I think maybe I'd have to agree with Teri--so far. If I could fault Ms. Horton in any way, she ought to take her problem as to how much she would actually accept for it, and turn it into a straight business decision--leave the emotion out. Set a minimum reserve, stick to it and auction it off. Make the decision as objective as her evidence.

But that brings me to an important point. I don't give a damn what the EXPERTS say about art. I only care if _I_ like it. And I like Teri's painting well enough to value it around the price she paid for it. It takes a valuer to provide a value. I'll bet if Teri really thought about it she'd agree.",1178496000,13,1405,4.567460317460317
2783963,3,B000NVI0EY,"I couldn't help but cheer for Horton as she brushed up against snobby art world academia while viewing this documentary, but it's not very hard to realize that art world jerkfaces don't make her painting an authentic Pollock. Horton begins by saying she just wants to find out if the painting is real or not, but by the end of the film she's shifted to accepting nothing less than $50 million for it. A similar pattern of behavior can be found throughout the film in the attitudes of Horton's forensic expert, Biro, who says something to the tune of, ""How can I prove this is a Pollock,"" rather than, ""I'd like to find conclusive evidence either way."" The lack of objectivity on Teri's part is understandable, the lack of it from an independent ""expert"" is not.

This film was made in 2006. I watched it in 2010. With the credits still rolling, I wondered if Teri ever wound up selling her piece, so I hit google for a little follow-up. First stop: wikipedia, where I found that her last offer was $9 million. She turned it down. Then I started uncovering all sorts of troublesome information.
* Biro has been accused of fraud and forging forensic evidence (more than once).
* FineArtRegistry . com launched an independent investigation into the fingerprint evidence, from a bona-fide fingerprint expert with decades of experience in the justice system.
* He went to Pollock's studio and collected the very same samples Biro used. He identified massive problems with Biro's ""conclusive"" evidence, including heavy doctoring of the fingerprint photo, and a lack of evidence matching the two prints (apparently the 3 match points would never be enough to convict anyone of anything in a criminal court setting). There's plenty more, but I'll leave that up to you to research on your own: fineartregistry.com/articles/far_investigates/jackson-pollock-teri-horton.php
* FineArtRegistry's investigation uncovered Frankie Brown, and artist who's mission was to ""pick up where Jackson Pollack left off."" When he saw an article in a magazine on Horton's painting, he immediately said to his wife, ""That looks like one of mine."" Horton found the painting in the general area he worked in, where he says he has distributed over 100 paintings since the 70's, even buying some of his own paintings back in thrift stores! Horton and her ""experts"" initially refused to let him see the painting in person. fineartregistry.com/articles/phillips_david/frankbrown_jackson_pollock_11-18-2006.php

My doubt started when they compared a close up shot of the painting right next to a genuine Pollock in the film. My instant reaction, despite the fact that I was still rooting for Horton at that point, was simply, ""These are not painted by the same person."" It's actually pretty easy to see if you look at the consistency of the actual paint. The paint on Horton's piece forms pools, where the paint on the Pollock seems thicker. The lines and techniques simply do not appear to have come from the same hand to me, but having a feeling is not very scientific or objective, so I hit google. I've become convinced Teri's painting was not done by Pollock (not that I would really mind seeing her take the art world for a ride).

Ultimately, this film is an interesting waste of time.",1281398400,21,3257,4.994475138121547
2783964,2,B000NVI0EY,"I have an extended meditation here, but the bottom line is this: the film is scientifically dumb and manipulative.
The critic Hoving offers real kickers to the myth of that this junk-shop painting (owned by Ms. Horton) was made by Pollock.  The director chose to repress (or was too dull to uncover) these simple, myth-busting facts.  Hoving relates these in a letter in ArtNews magazine: 1) that the Horton found-in-a-junk-shop item was painted on a stock, commercially framed-and-sized canvas. Pollock never used such, but used odd-ball, idiosyncratically sized canvases; and 2) the paints in the Horton image are all acrylics (acrylics were scarcely available to Pollock, and though he used a few, he is on record as _never_ making an entire painting of _nothing but_ acrylics!).
---
This film's subject is sometimes an amusing character; she has a compelling, hard scrabble background and can spin a barroom yarn.  But I can find such a person in most any saloon.  Her stubbornness is not an unusual human trait, but the filmmaker is in awe of it, and seems to follow it as a potential guide to a painting's authenticity. But stubbornness is not equal in value to reasoned principles. The film makes occasional offers of an unbiased assessment as to whether this painting is a real Pollock or not.  But its main argument is something like ""hard-headed wishing can make it so""--this shtick isn't non-conformist, though the filmmaker tries to sell it that way.
  The film's most dubious character is not Volpe, the ex-con (and admitted con-man) art dealer hired by Ms. Horton to sell  her painting, but the Montreal painting analyst Biro, who claims that a smudged, partial fingerprint on the rear of the Horton canvas is a certain match to a smudge on a paint can handled by Pollock.  Common sense and actual criminal science forensic fingerprint analysts (e.g., see the Fine Arts Registry website and Tom Hanley's analysis) claim that these prints are too compromised and small to be of scientific use.  Biro also seems to have placed a rubber stamp of _the same print on the Horton_  onto the back of another unsigned ""possible"" Pollock--who could find that compelling?)
  The film is bewilderingly short on educated, detailed responses comparing line and color in the Horton painting and actual Pollocks.  This made the film seem like it had something to hide behind Biro's carny-man bluster about fingerprints.  Here's an  example of the kind of analysis I'd like more of: based on images of the Horton painting in the film, I judge that it is that this is a fake (not a counterfeit, but an amused homage) Pollock made in the 1970s.  I offer this guess because of the colors and their proximity in the painting.  The rest of my impression is based on the density of the design and the monotony of the curved shapes in the painting. Pollock often used colors (colors that strike on me as ""50s colors"") that were dark, intense, metallic or earthy.  Rarely does he put colors like bright orange, turquoise, and red hard against each other.  Admittedly he does use some bright colors in ""Number 5,"" but there the yellow and red are spread far apart and not densely laced on top of each other. The amounts of turquoise and orange in the Horton painting seem especially un-Pollock like, and the swirls seem too uninterrupted, repetitious, and densely layered.  The stuffy, old-school curator (Thomas Hoving), brought in early in the film, tosses off the observation that the Horton painting is too compact and busy to be a Pollock--and that remains one of the few painting-literate analyses in the whole #$&%*(^ movie.
  Most Pollocks give the viewer a sense of receding spaces beyond the surface that the Horton painting lacks.  Pollock paintings also tend to have more straight lines made by sharp, whip-like gestures of the painter's arm and hand and have areas that seem more calligraphic than just randomly swirled as the Horton painting does. If one is familiar with Pollock's pre-spatter style, which often involved calligraphic and/or vaguely figural designs, sometimes Picasso-esque, one can see more abstract but still distinct versions of such pre-spatter era designs within the Pollock spatter paintings of the late 40s and 1950s.  The Horton painting seems an aggressive, monotonous collection of swirls.  This is admittedly what many people claim all Pollock paintings look like. But the devil is in the details: I have yet to see a certified Pollock that looks like the Horton painting.",1278201600,6,4502,4.977303070761015
2783965,3,B000NVI0EY,"On the surface of it, 'Who The #$&% Is Jackson Pollock?' is the struggle of 73-year-old Teri Horton, a retired long-haul truck driver, to authenticate her five dollar flea market find as a genuine Jackson Pollock painting.  As the film progresses though, the emphasis subtly shifts from recording Teri's authentication efforts to highlighting how the established art world dismissed her claim based solely on her outsider status.  From their perspective, she's a kook, one who's wasting their time with a pipe dream of having found a fifty million dollar painting in a thrift store.  To her, their refusal even to return her phone calls when she began her quest was tantamount to a declaration of war.  So she enlists the help of Peter Paul Biro, a forensic specialist, and Tod Volpe, a former art dealer to Hollywood film stars - who had also served two years in prison for defrauding those same celebrities.

As I watched this film, and as the filmmakers documented the evidence to support Horton's claim, I began to feel amazed at the colossal dunderheads who were refusing to consider seriously the authenticity of Horton's painting.  The smug egoism of Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, was especially infuriating, and the sheep-like mentality of the rest of the establishment, who marched in lock-step with Hoving's - and others - verdict that her painting was not genuine, imparted at least some of the frustration that Teri must have felt during her years-long battle.  However, after reflection, and some slight internet research, I have fewer convictions now than I had at the film's conclusion.

A Google search of Thomas Hoving Teri Horton will produce an article from Artnews, written by Hoving, that presents alternatives to the proof offered in the film - but to my mind, the authenticity of Ms. Horton's painting is secondary to determining the objective of the filmmakers.  The fact that Tod Volpe is credited as Art Consultant for the film, and Peter Paul Biro as Science Consultant (both of whom were enlisted for their experience and knowledge to ultimately assist in the sale of the painting), raised red flags for me.  These potential conflicts of interest don't signify anything by themselves, but after reading the Artnews article, I started to re-examine my initial feelings about the film and took a closer look at the way it was constructed, and then I began to wonder, despite the patina of neutrality, if the slant toward Ms. Horton was orchestrated.

If Thomas Hoving's antics and outlandish statements regarding his expertise were removed from the film, the other representatives from the art world would sound reasonable and measured - a point that couldn't have escaped the filmmakers' attention.  Without him, Ms. Horton's story would still be interesting, but there would be no face to represent the gated community of the art world - no bad guy - and much of the sympathy for Teri Horton's quest would be sucked right out of the film.  At the same time, Hoving's reputation and rsum made him a legitimate source, regardless of his behavior, and so the choice to include his comments is certainly justifiable.  But with his presence, the argument is principles, not necessarily authenticity, with Ms. Horton winning easily.  Although all the facts of the case would remain the same, we would essentially see two different films based on whether he appears in the film or not.  As it stands, as a disinterested viewer, I want Teri's painting validated simply because Thomas Hoving comes across as a big jerk.

The question then is no longer about the authenticity of the painting, or even about the class prejudice Teri Horton ran into during her efforts.  It is a matter of whether the filmmakers deliberately constructed the film as an appeal to spite to bolster other evidence.  If so, then it's more agitprop than documentary.  If not, and I assume no one twisted Thomas Hoving's arm to make him act as he does, then the filmmakers simply found an excellent example to reflect the conditions that exist between the Teri Hortons of the world and the restricted environment of art connoisseurship.

Although I understand that this is only a review of the film, I do think it is appropriate to bring up these questions about the film's objectivity, especially since its emotional appeal is so effective.  While it would be impossible to say definitively that the filmmakers had ulterior motives, I obviously have some muted suspicions, which in turn influences how I perceive the other issues.  Still, the film was informative, and I would recommend it with severe qualifications, but lingering questions about the filmmaker's intent prevents me from giving it a full four stars.  Three and a half, rounded down.",1272585600,13,4791,4.989949748743719
2783966,4,B000NVI0EY,"Thinking this was a documentary about Jackson Pollock, I borrowed it from a local library. It turns out to be more of a real-life mystery than a study of Pollock, the man or his work. But along the way, one learns quite a bit about this strange and intriguing figure and his abstract painting (if that is the proper label). The plot-line is simple: an uneducated and plucky female truck driver, named Teri Horton, buys a large, odd painting for a friend from a thrift shop for $5. She is later told that it looks like a Jackson Pollock original. She eventually learns who he was (she had no idea, and thought the the painting was essentially junk, since it was nonrepresentational), the tremendous worth of his painting (a new original work would fetch fifty million dollars), and approaches the art world in the hope that it will be authenticated as a genuine Pollock.

The film is about how we know things (epistemology)--in this case, how do we know whether a painting is painted by a particular painter. That is, how to we come to a justified and true belief about this painting? Was it painted by Pollock or not? To answer this, one must consider criteria for authenticity. We find (at least) two cultures in conflict here. The culture of the experts in the art world and the culture of forensics. Those in the art world largely rejected the painting as inauthentic. Some rejected it forcefully, others more hesitantly, but no recognized art expert certified the painting as a Pollock for the following reasons. (1) It is unsigned. (2) It has no provenance. Provenance concerns the documented genealogy of the painting, its causal ancestry or pedigree. Mrs. Horton bought it as a thrift shop and was not able to gather information beyond that. That is, it simply appears as a painting without a history. (3) It does not look enough like a Pollock work to the trained eye.

However, there is another angle to pursue--forensic evience. Mrs. Horton hires a forensic expert who has authenticated several annonomous paintings as legitimate works by well-known artists. He finds a fingerprint on the back of the painting that matches one found in Pollock's studio. He also finds paint like that used by Pollock. The art world cares nothing for this: forensics is not art criticism. They are two different worlds, with two different sets of criteria.

This epistemological debate is what I found fascinating about the film. I did not warm to the crusty, seventy-three-year old who discovered the painting. One may pity her hard life and appreciate her feistiness, but she strikes me as crass and pointlessly stubborn--refusing to sell a painting of at least questionable pedigree for nine million dollars. She says her unwillingness to sell for anything less than the full worth of a Pollock is a matter of ""principle."" But what principle might that be? Apparently, she is convinced it is a Pollock, and hired a professional art dealer to sell it as such (a rather slick and slimy character, to be sure). But is any moral principle violated if one sells a painting for nine million dollars when, in fact, it may be worth fifty million; however? There is, after all, still good reason to question its authenticity.

What is intriguing is the epistemological elements (at least to this philosopher). What criteria are normative for identifying a work of art? When the experts evaluate the work, they size it up rather intuitively, based on previous knowledge of Pollock's style. But they do not all agree. Moreover, artists do vary their style to some degree. The other side has to do with trying find in the extant painting some forensic (not aesthetic) quality that identifies it as having been painted by Pollack. This involves photography, chemistry, and some speculative history (since documented provenance cannot be established). One large question is whether one can establish a plausible scenario in which Pollack, an established if eccentric painter, somehow lets one of his works lose such that it ends up in a thrift shop in California, as opposed to having it displayed in a New York art museum or as part of an art collector's collection.

It is difficult to come to a conclusion about the identity of this painting. But working through the questions is fascinating and rewarding. To make a more accurate assessment, one would need much more than simply a film on which to base a judgment. This is not a film that directly addresses the aesthetic value of Jackson Pollock's paintings or the worldview behind his work. (At some point, Pollock set up mechanical means by which to make paintings which attempted to leave out his own personality and rely on chance. Francis Schaeffer assesses this philosophically in ""How Shall We Then Live?"") However, the film stimulates significant thought about the art of knowing. Who is a reliable witness? What are the proper criteria for truth assessment. For those reasons, I delighted in the film and may use it for teaching on these subjects.",1263427200,2,4992,4.889020070838253
2783967,5,B000NVI0EY,"This is a splendid documentary that reveals a great deal about the art world, about its exclusivity, its disdain for outsiders, and its inherent irrationality.  The story starts when truck driver Teri Horton buys a painting in a thrift shop for $5.  Later, when trying to sell it at a carport sale an art teacher suggests that it might be a Jackson Pollock.  What ensues is a story of Teri being constantly rejected by the art world in her attempts to get her painting validated as a Pollock.  A string of art experts deny its authenticity and many whom she attempts to contact will not even respond to her.  Eventually, however, forensic experts become involved, turning up apparently incontrovertible proof that the painting was indeed painted by Pollock, showing that the paint is completely consistent with that which Pollock used, but more importantly that a fingerprint found on the painting was identical to fingerprints found in Pollock's studio.  (In the closing credits a note tell us that an identical print to the one on the back of Teri's painting was found on an authenticated Pollock painting.)  As a forensic expert says, responding to art experts who want to deny the painting's authenticity despite the powerful and apparently conclusive proof, ""What is the difference between a finger print on a painting and a finger print on a murder weapon?""  His point is that a fingerprint is sufficient proof to convict someone of murder, but the art world rejects such powerful proof in this instance.

What we see, in the end, is a clash of cultures.  Teri is working class; in fact, poor working class.  She is low brow, unsophisticated, and earthy (though quite likable).  The ultimate contrast in the film is between Teri and an art expert who is a former head of MOMA, whose disdain and sense of superiority are utterly repulsive.  Others in the film also reject the validity of the painting, but none are quite such horrid specimens of humanity (this individual proves that there is absolutely no connection between a deep understanding of the humanities and being a good person).  The film reminded me a great deal of some of the writings of Columbia University professor Arthur Danto (with whom I was able to take a graduate seminar with as a guest professor at Yale), where he talks about the art world, which is many ways is an artificial construction.  The art world dubs one painting an authentic Pollock by one set of criteria, but rejects Teri's painting as an authentic Pollock, refusing to acknowledge a competing set of criteria that is objectively convincing in a way that the subjective criteria employed by these particular critics.  The art establishment is revealed as an artifact in no less way than a painting is.

My own feeling looking at the painting is that it is not a very good Jackson Pollock.  It isn't as compelling as his other paintings.  But I don't see how it is possible to deny its authenticity given the fingerprint.  That is the sort of evidence that ought to end discussion.  Creating a scenario under which someone both created a pretty convincing Pollock, including adding a finger print, seems close to impossible.  In the end, what this documentary does is explain less about Pollock than it does about the world of art.  Anyone interested in the art industry needs to see this film.",1258070400,,3338,4.838028169014085

2783971,4,B000NVI0EY,"This film makes me wonder how disconnected from reality we've become.  The painting has been forensically linked to Jackson Pollock.  The art world does not deny this, yet becaue there is no provenance the picture can not stand on its' own as a Pollack.  Ok, that I can nearly accept; it may well diminish the value of the painting.  But, for the two or three experts to look at this painting and say they are certain it is not a Pollack is just too much to stomach.  I was genuinely shocked by the pompous air of the James Cromwell look a like.  I've never seen a more self important human being who wasn't playing some kind of cartoon character like Donald Trump.  I really think this man is that full of himself.  It's not funny at all either.  This film casts a light on the art community, and what it reveals is a cast of nefarious, seedy, bragadocious, pimps and crooks.  What good are these experts doing anyone, what do they contribute to society other than protecting their own cloistered existence?  Is this the consequence of our disconnection with the Earth and nature, have we all specialized to an extent that we're not really doing anything of true worth?  This is counter balanced by Teri and her family.  Teri is abrassive, drinks too much, and for me is a little over the top.  But, I do see her as representing the side of principle in this fight, of trying to get to the truth.  She has been in the trenches and had to fight and work through life, being given nothing.  When you come from the perpsective that dumpster diving makes sense, and truthfully it probably does, you're not going to be cast aside by those you feel are wasteful, lazy, useless, academics. That's what the film made me think about anyway.  It's a good movie and well worth your time in my opinion.",1236038400,,1791,4.478395061728395
2783972,5,B000NVI0EY,"This engrossing documentary centers around a painting done in an abstract expressionistic style found in a thrift store by a cantankerous female truck driver.  The question:  ""Was it done by Jackson Pollock or not?"".  The truck driver, Teri Horton, maintains that it was, which is not surprising since it is valued at around $50-60 million dollars.  The professional art world, however, does not like the pedigree and most decree it is a fake.

Teri Horton has carried on her battle with the intelligencia for more than a decade, and does have one supporter in her cause:  a forsensic expert who claims to have found one of Pollock's partial fingerprints on the back of the canvas.

If you're hoping for a neat resolution to the mystery, you won't find it here, and since Pollock's style is (at least to the lay person) quite easy to imitate (there's even a website where you can create your own original Pollock), it's doubtful the mystery will ever be solved.

The fun lies in watching the 8th grade graduate take on the art world with a determined obsessiveness, and perhaps showing the emperor has no clothes.  Is much of modern art a fraud being foisted on the general public, or do years of studying art give an iron-clad eye for detecting all things fradulent?  The debate will continue as long as there are artists, critics and phillistines.

2784018,4,B000NVI0EY,"""Who the #$&% Is Jackson Pollock?"" is an entertaining documentary about a salty retired female trucker named Teri Horton who buys a $5 painting in a thrift store to give as a gift to a friend.  The friend (who like Teri lives in a trailer park) is horrified by the ugly painting and politely (or not so politely actually) asks Teri to keep it herself.  When Teri tries to sell the painting at a garage sale, someone tells her that it looks like a Jackson Pollock, which solicits the titular quote from Teri (with the #$&% replaced by a rather choice cuss word).  So begins Teri's quest to prove that the ugly painting is indeed a masterpiece from one of the most famous 20th century American painters.  If it is, experts estimated that a Pollock painting of that size could fetch up to $50,000,000.

Apparently, people regularly come forth with found paintings that they think were done by important artists.  Most of these paintings are found to be fakes and the story ends there.  What these other paintings lack is a championing from a stubborn old cuss like Teri Horton.  When art experts told her that her painting was not a Pollock, she was disappointed thinking about the lost millions; however, she was even more irritated by the rude brush off she received from these eggheads.  She clearly was offended that the art world rejected not only her painting but her as well!  So she systematically sought out people to help her, including an infamous art swindler and a forensic expert.  Together they tried to take on the art system and expose its shortcomings.

The documentary is very entertaining, and the makers cleverly avoid taking sides about the painting.  The pros and cons of both sides are portrayed here, although I think most audiences will find Teri and her batch of misfits more likeable and perhaps believable than the art expert blowhards.  In the end, whether the painting is real doesn't much matter for the picture to work; it's strong enough exploring issues pertaining to the art world and the nature of art.  Overall, ""Who the #$&% Is Jackson Pollock"" is a very fun documentary that introduces interesting people and will leave the viewer thinking about finding lost treasures in a thrift store.",1231459200,,2224,4.7702349869451695
2784019,4,B000NVI0EY,"Looking for a gift to cheer up a friend, Teri Horton finds a splotchy, squiggly painting in a thrift shop and buys it for $5.  Someone tells her that it may have been painted by Jackson Pollock, a major god of abstract expressionist art.  If it's certified as a Pollock, $5 just became $50 million.  All Teri has to do is convince the experts, and we have a ringside seat as this feisty, foul-mouthed, long haul trucker lays siege to the art world.

Teri's the underdog, and we're rooting for her over the experts, who come across as sniffy and supercilious.  Teri has two big proof problems: no signature and no provenance (the documented history of whose hands the painting passed through on the way to yours.)  She gets a huge boost from a forensic art expert in Canada who matches a fingerprint from Teri's painting with one he's lifted from Pollock's studio.  He matches up some paint samples as well.  This doesn't convince the experts, who give more credence to the fact that it doesn't ""feel"" like a Pollock.  (And, if you've stared at enough Pollocks yourself, you may agree with them - something about the lack of looseness and expressiveness in the hand that applied the paint.)

Class, and its role in the art world, is an issue.  Teri's blue collar all the way, her life shaped by grit, humor, heart, self-destructiveness and bad luck.  She's a complex and appealing character, but not likely to convince the curators and gallerists that she owns a major painting by a major painter.  The art dealer she hires to help her is mainly interested in getting her out of the picture so he can maneuver in the moneyed circles whose attention is needed to make the painting credible.

Is Teri Horton's Pollock real or a fake?  The documentary gives you all the points of view, and lets you draw your own conclusion.  Along the way, you'll get an entertaining look at how the art game is played in America, and learn a lot about the arbiters and guardians of ""authentic"" artistic genius.",1228089600,,1991,4.62962962962963

This documentary exposes the art world and the apparent art experts for the pugnacious morons that they are.

The documentary focuses around Terri Horton a small town trailer park female truck driver who one day buys a painting from a thrift store for $5. She is told by someone that she may be in possession of an original Jackson Pollock painting worth over $50 Million. She's never heard of Jackson Pollock but becomes determined to prove its authenticity. She struggles to get experts to take a look at it, but due to their own snobbery they downright refuse to even look.

This documentary has a so called expert Thomas Hoving take a look at it, but as predicted he downright turns down its authenticity and claims his ""expertise"" are above even forensic evidence. He seems possibly the most infuriating person that can ever be featured in a documentary and I hope he doesn't express how the art world really is, as it's truly ugly.

A wonderful documentary that has you hoping she will succeed in her task to have it authenticated then sold. I would highly recommend it to anyone that isn't even familiar with the art world.",1220140800,,1330,4.6995708154506435
2784022,3,B000NVI0EY,"It sounded like an appealing story but too bad for me I didn't remember until after it came in the mail from Amazon, how most documentaries leave you with questions that just can't be answered, and the bonus material on this DVD is singularly flat.  Maybe there's some interesting info on the DYD-CDROM fetaure, but it can't be accessed with my humble MAC.  There are so many questions I want to know the answers to.  The product description calls Teri Horton a 73-year-old retired truckdriver who bought this pucture at a thrift store.  Then they say it has been a 15 year fight against the art world.  Was she 73 when she bought the picture, and is she 88 now?  If so she's in really good shape.

When she started to lie about how she got the picture, that's when I tuned out a bit.  Horton has more problems than the film is willing to admit.  The fil;m is ostensibly about the art world but really it's more about the emotional problems of a woman feisty on the outside, and really messed up on the inside.  Joan Blondell would have done a better job of playing her, than she does herself.

I had this DVD for awhile, maybe a year, without ever getting the energy to put it in the DVD drive and watching it, but when my wife and I came back from a trip to Boulder, we found it whirring around in the DVD player and decided either the cats, or the catsitter, had tried it out.  Hope they enjoyed it more than I did, not that it's bad, it's just I felt sorry for this woman they keep showing and treating like some sort of country-fried moron, fighting the big boys upstairs.

Most of the other reviews cover the essential details, so I won't repeat them. However, for a movie with a running time of only 74 minutes on a DVD with no special features, outtakes or anything else, it's way overpriced at $25.

2784024,5,B000NVI0EY,"Remember the story about Galileo's trouble with church authorities--how bishops refused even to look through his telescope to see phenomena that called into question the old Aristotelian model of the solar system they insisted was correct?  Well, that's the first thing that came to mind as I watched this film about Teri Horton's on-going struggle with artworld authorities over whether her alledged Jackson Pollack canvas is authentic.  I don't know if it is or isn't--although the film does suggest there's good reason to think it is--but it's pretty clear that the artworld epigones are highly resistant to looking through her telescope.

That's what most fascinated me about the film.  There's an insularity to the artworld that goes way beyond snobbery.  Thomas Hoving, the former MOMA director interviewed extensively in the film, personifies the insularity perfectly in his continuous dismissal of Horton as an uneducated lout who, unlike he, is no ""connossieur,"" no ""expert.""  Expertise in any field is, of course, important, and experts ought to be taken seriously when they offer their judgments.  But the presumption that only experts can speak with any authority is dubious.  And their right to belittle others is nonexistent.

Another fascinating aspect brought out by the film is the artworld' essential conservatism.  Peter Paul Biro, who applies forensic techniques to determine the authenticity of artworks, demonstrates in the film that Horton's canvas has one of Pollack's fingerprints, uses pigments that match samples taken from his studio, and is comparable in technique to his other paintings.  Yet because the painting lacks provenance--a paper record of lineage--and (one suspects) because Horton is seen as an uncouth interloper--artworld authorities refuse to take Biro's findings seriously.  Again:  they just won't look through the telescope.

Why the resistance?  Partly, no doubt, for noble reasons.  But it's also the case, as Tod Volpe observes in the film, that art is big bucks.  The artworld, he says, is all about ""high leveraging.  It's about power, money, and greed.""  The powerbrokers in the artworld aren't about to forgo any of their influence, and mightily resist mavericks who try to break in.

All of this makes for disillusionment with the artworld, but not much of a surprise.  After all, Tom Wolfe pretty much pointed out the same thing in his magnificent The Painted Word years ago.  But what one isn't disillusioned about at the end of the film is Teri Horton.  Right or wrong about the Pollack canvas as she may be, what she's done is to stand up to the guys in hand-tailored suits and preciously decorated Manhattan apartments who think that the artworld belongs to them.",1213574400,,2724,5.225806451612903

No extras, no commentary, nothing, but it's still a great DVD. This would make a good companion DVD for the POLLOCK movie. Watch POLLOCK and then follow it up by watching this. The end was a bit annoying. I caused me to dislike the woman who owns the painting. To be honest I think she's foolish and stubborn. Maybe in the beginning I could understand her reluctance to take an offer I would have taken in a second but at the end of the movie, what it says she does is just selfish and dumb. I had the feeling in watching this that fate had sent good fortune this woman but she's so foolish she messed it all up.

So begins Horton's strange journey into trying to get the art world to say that her painting is the real thing. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying she fails: Horton never gets any respect from experts, and the question regarding the authenticity of the work is still unanswered. But whether you believe this is a Jackson Pollock or not, this is a fascinating documentary, with a unique cast of characters.

There's Horton, of course, a woman in her seventies, who's had more than her share of hardship and sees in the ""ugly painting"" a much needed lottery ticket. But Horton's motivation is not just greed. What she wants is respect and recognition--she wants the world to recognize that she has a Jackson Pollock and until they do, she rejects offers as large as nine million dollars (!). The problem is she encounters unbelievable arrogance, in the way of so-called experts who will dismiss any piece of evidence that contradicts their beliefs and interests. I'm referring, of course, to Thomas Hoving, and Tod Volpe, who are on opposite ends of this fight, but who are equally bad. Hoving is a pompous jerk who dismisses the existence of a fingerprint as evidence of anything--what's a fingerprint against the expert testimony of an infallible god as himself? And Tod Volpe's not any better. He takes on Horton's fight to try to recover his reputation, and financial situation, after being convicted and jailed for fraud--and then he tries to get rid of Horton, whom he allegedly ""loves."" With two such horrible men playing a role in her destiny, it's no wonder Horton is still, all these years later, stuck in the limbo of having a painting that might be a treasure or a piece of junk.",1189036800,,1839,4.764890282131661
2784038,4,B000NVI0EY,"Although ostensibly a documentary on Teri Horton and the maybe-yes/maybe-no Jackson Pollock painting she found in a thrift store for $5, I would contend this movie is actually about much more than that.

Like the Connie Willis short story ""The Last of the Winnebagos"" -- which really isn't about Winnebagos at all -- this documentary uses Teri Horton's story as the foreground to reveal an unsavory background behind her story.  Producer Don Hewitt, of ""60 Minutes"" fame, very cleverly indicts the present day art world and what has happened to it with the huge influx of disposable income created in the past 30 years.  Newly-minted software billionaires and hedge fund managers have caused art prices to skyrocket beyond all sense of proportion, with crazy prices being paid for minor pieces all over the world.

Pollock is a perfect example of what's wrong with today's art world: an alcoholic, mentally-unstable troglodyte whose paintings are now highly valued as investments (David Geffen just sold one for $140M).  To the general public however, including truck drivers like Teri Horton, it's just ugly paint splashes on a canvas.

Art dealers, art historians and self-appointed art experts all have a vested interest in controlling the supply of ""product,"" and Teri's efforts to have her ""find"" authenticated are Herculean and amazing.  But what really shines through in this documentary, is the class difference between the billionaires with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in collectible baubles, and the peasants like Teri who think an ugly canvas is still an ugly canvas, whether somebody pays $50 million for it or not.  This whole film is a finger in the eye of the bubbleheads who have allowed money to totally supersede aesthetics in the art world.

Another factor that comes through strongly is that none of these art experts feel that Teri Horton *deserves* $50M.  They might be perfectly willing to bid the painting up to that level if it goes through several dealers and auction houses, each taking a percentage of the sale... but nobody is going to hand Teri a check for the whole amount.  That would be tantamount to admitting that art is about the artwork, not commerce.",1187913600,,2210,5.0109289617486334

On the entertainment side we are introduced to an almost stereotypical female trucker. By the end of the movie you want her to be your grandmother.  You get a chance to see what this person has been through in life and you just can't help but relate, wanting nothing for the best for her.  It's a typical David and Goliath story and here you cheer for the underdog, or in this case, trucker.

On the educational side you enter the world of art, art institutions, and art history.  My personal background is in those areas and I can say that the movie is vey authentic in dealing within those situations.  And how overpowering those established institutions and personages can be for a layperson.  You get some education about the art of Jackson Pollock, an insight into provenance (the paperwork of ownership) of art, and a taste of learning how to prove the authenticiity of a work of art.

The movie has a nice pace to it, only a little over an hour.  The characters are likeable or easy-to-hate.  There is quite a bit of humor in it as well, all coming from Teri's side.  And you walk away haveing learned something about art.",1185321600,,1370,4.493927125506073
2784040,4,B000NVI0EY,"I'm not buying this ladies story. The canvas this thing is painted on is worth a couple hundred bucks, so it is unlikely that any thrift store is going to sell it for five bucks. The funny thing is the old lady trucker, Teri, can't even prove where she bought it from because the ""thrift store"" looks like it's been closed for about a million years.
She's already been caught making up one elaborate lie after another in regards to the origin of the painting so any thing she says now becomes automatically suspect.
The real reason Teri is so willing to invest so much money and go to such great lengths to prove this painting is a Pollock is because she already knows it is.  If someone offered you nine million dollars for a painting that looks like it was done by a messy preschooler, would you turn it down? She knows how much this painting is worth and she's not willing to accept anything less.
In my opinion this painting was more than likely stolen from one of Pollocks early studios. As the film points out, Pollock, a hardcore alcoholic, was less than vigilant when it came to protecting his art work.

I don't know how she came to possess the painting, I seriously doubt she bought it from a thrift store. It's more likely that it was passed along to her by a relative or an acquaintance, someone who knew the thief. As the forensic evidence shows it's clearly a Pollock. A Pollock fingerprint is a thousand times better than a Pollock signature.

I know 25 million dollars is a lot of money, but how would a 70-plus-year-old trucker set up this fraud? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't present expert evidence against the painting. How good is the partial fingerprint? Would the fingerprint stand up in a court of law? However, the art critics arguments against the forensic evidence are pretty lame.

The film stands up well as a documentary, covering a lot of ground to interview witnesses who knew Pollock, as well as forensic, art, and legal experts.

The only thing standing between Ms. Horton and $50,000,000 (the estimated value of the painting if it were deemed authentic) is a bunch of arrogant blowholes who can't utter a single coherent or persuasive sentence in support of their position that the painting is a fake.

Having grown up with people who became the world's most profound art critics once they got a little alcohol in them and who regularly counseled me that what I was learning in art school was all wrong, I found this DVD quite fun. It was fair to both the experts and the philistines.

I am sure that the experts will seem quite funny to a lot of folks. Yes, it looks weird the way elderly men twist and dance in front of Teri's painting to visually test it for it's possible Pollockness. But, those feelings are ironic in the context of this story. While experts are questioned as to how they know what they know, other experts are touted as being experts, and therefore right. I suppose it is a matter of expert against expert.

It also offers an insight into the world of people who decide what we will see in museums, a world that almost none of us has anything to do with.

I had to wonder why the arty set was so relentless in their opposition to her claim. What would they lose if it turns out to be genuine?  Also, I have to wonder why Pollock's real paintings are worth multi-millions. Sure, they're interesting, but I fail to see why they're worth that much. $25,000, sure - $25,000,000, no.

I truly enjoyed watching this documentary. It is amazing to hear stories about how people find various items at thrift stores, flea markets, garage sales, and so on and later on learn that the item they have purchased might actually be worth A LOT OF MONEY!

In this case, Teri Horton, a retired truck driver, purchased a painting for $5.00 at a thrift store to cheer up a depressed friend. Ms. Horton thought the painting was ugly, but that her friend might like it. Well, her friend thought it was ugly too. So, Ms. Horton went about selling it at a yard sale, when she learned from an art teacher at her yard sale that the painting might be done by artist, Jackson Pollock.

Ms. Horton had never heard of Jackson Pollock before, but went about discovering if the painting was in fact a genuine Pollock painting or not. This documentary takes you through Ms. Horton's years of struggle just to get anyone to take her seriously that she may even posses a Jackson Pollock painting, let alone come out and attempt to authentic the painting.

I cannot help but think of one of Hunter Thompson's quotes that starts, 'The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die.' The music business has nothing on the art world if this film is any indication.

Since the story is well covered in other reviews I will give my take on the documentary itself. First, it is instructive. I thought I had learned a thing of two about Pollock and his art from prior research, but in the process of documenting the story a great deal of information about his technique was revealed. That alone is worth watching this movie.

Then there is what looks like the art world against we mere mortals. There were a few experts that I would have loved to strangle based on their attitudes, but their reasoning was pretty solid. Again, if you ever wanted a course in rigorous analysis and how experts can allow empirical viewpoints to color findings, this is a good place to start.

As for the actual outcome, I have not bothered to delve into that. The fact that I came away with a better understanding of Pollock and his techniques was enough for me to rate this film as highly as I did. Plus, the glimpse into the art world was fascinating (as were the processes employed to authenticate art.)",1445904000,,1366,4.5

Like an extended 60 minutes segment, the film presents all aspects of the drama surrounding San Bernadino resident Teri Horton, a retired long-haul truck driver, spent ten year crusade to certify that her thrift store art purchase is an authentic Jackson Pollock painting.
  As the film progresses though, the emphasis shifts from recording Teri's authentication efforts to highlighting how the established art world dismissed her claim based solely on her outsider status. From their perspective, she's a kook, one who's wasting their time with a pipe dream of having found a fifty million dollar painting in a thrift store. To her, their refusal even to return her phone calls when she began her quest was tantamount to a declaration of war. So she enlists the help of Peter Paul Biro, a forensic specialist, and Tod Volpe, a former art dealer to Hollywood film stars - who had also served two years in prison for defrauding those same celebrities.
  The film stands up well as a documentary, covering a lot of ground to interview witnesses who knew Pollock, as well as forensic, art, and legal experts. Bottom line is that the fingerprint and other physical evidence pointing to the authenticity of the painting is just overwhelming; if this were a murder case, there would be more than ample evidence to send someone to the electric chair.
  It is difficult to come to a conclusion about the identity of this painting. But working through the questions is fascinating and rewarding. To make a more accurate assessment, one would need much more than simply a film on which to base a judgment. This is not a film that directly addresses the aesthetic value of Jackson Pollock's paintings or the worldview behind his work.

I don't think it matters whether Teri Horton believes her painting is a genuine Pollock or not - she is a semi-retired truck driver who didn't even know who Pollock was before. I think she is crazy for not selling the painting for $2 or $9 million dollars. Despite what she says, I don't think it's about the principle...it's about money.

Since art by prominent figures can be such big expensive business, then it makes sense that art collectors want to see provenance, a signature or something that shows authenticity. With art forgers, hoaxes, frauds abounding, and potential big money involved, it makes sense to be skeptical.

Teri Horton didn't help her case by telling the whooper of how she got the painting through a Hollywood bar owner. She also missed the boat by choosing Tod Volpe, a convicted art dealer who defrauded clients, to help her. I think Tod Volpe and the self-proclaimed ""forensic expert"" Peter Paul Biro, have their own agendas in claiming the painting is authentic (most likely financial stakes).

When I looked at the two paintings side by side, I definitely saw a difference between the two.

Stubbornness, and wishful thinking don't make a painting authentic. But I think people want to believe that you can just rummage around in a thrift store or dump and find an amazingly expensive item.
