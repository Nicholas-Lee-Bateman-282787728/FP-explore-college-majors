5528714,4,B00AYV0KIM,"I think this has gone too far, folks.  Even though it's a must for some of you who are late in starting your collection of Cartoon Network classics, ""4 Kid Favorites: Cartoon Network Hall of Fame, Volume 2"" is somewhat fruitless like the first volume.  Then again, a couple of these DVDs are sort of hard to find nowadays, but that's besides the point.

You'll get the following for what you pay for in this set:
- ""Samurai Jack - Season One, Disc One""
- ""Courage the Cowardly Dog - Season One, Disc Two"" (Why not the second disc in the ""Johnny Bravo"" season one set instead ?)
- ""Codename: Kids Next Door - Sooper Huge Missions File One""
- and ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends - Season One, Disc Two""

Well, anyways, I think this stupid series redistribution idea is not very keen to me and maybe you, too.  I still want continuations of series already on DVD like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"" and new sets of shows never started on DVD like ""Cow and Chicken"", ""Mike, Lu, and Og"", ""Squirrel Boy"", and, I don't know, ""Sym-Bionc Titan"", maybe ?  So, PLEASE make this happen before I grow too old for cartoons here !  If only there was, like, some kind of petition we could start here for this....

So, for now, keep yourself busy with what you've got, and look for classic episodes on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Planet block as well as the Boomerang channel (IF you have it).",1363737600,3,1415,4.478599221789883
5528715,4,B00AYV0KIM,"The answer is: Both. I, myself, am a collector. This set comes with a rare disc that is no longer being produced by the manufacturer(granted, it's not a hard DVD to come across and you can find pretty cheap, but it will eventually become fairly rare).

This DVD set includes:
-Samurai Jack Season One Disc One
-Courage The Cowardly Dog Season One Disc Two
-Codename: Kids Next Door Mission File One(rare dvd)
-Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends Season One Disc Two

This is a good set for collector's because of the rare DVD and slick packaging. This is also a good set for regular fans who just want a bunch of episodes to relive nostalgia. In fact, this set is GREAT for those kinds of fans. If you grew up from 2000-onward(as that's when these shows aired), then you will absolutely adore this collection.",1360627200,7,809,4.611111111111111
5528716,5,B00AYV0KIM,"This is the best Dvd ever! For one thing, it includes episodes from super hard to find Dvds like samurai jack, kids next door, and fosters. It is a really good deal considering you are getting 30 episodes plus a couple special features. It includes the second disc from the hall of fame courage the cowardly dog complete first season, the first disc of the seasons of fosters and samurai jack, and kids next door sooper hugest missions vol. 1.",1360368000,2,443,4.55

8559356,4,B00AYV0KIM,"If for some reason you've never seen these shows, here's a quick rundown. These are all from the first seasons of classic shows from the late '90s/early 2000s but they're suitable for kids of all ages, though Courage can get very eerie. The basic premise is evident in their titles, but here's a quick rundown anyway:

SAMURAI JACK: A samurai is flung into the distant future by a shapeshifting wizard who rules the world. Jack has to return to his own time and stop the wizard from ever taking over. Light action sequences.
COURAGE THE COWARDLY DOG: Courage lives with an old couple in the middle of Nowhere, where eerie visitors come to visit, with sinister plans for the couple. It's up to Courage to save them. Very eerie. Definitely not for kids under 8 years old.
CODENAME: KIDS NEXT DOOR: A group of kids part of a global network of secret operatives save their neighborhood from rival factions with childish goals (Stealing candy, spreading lice). Suitable for all ages. (Obnoxious to me as an adult)
FOSTER'S HOME FOR IMAGINARY FRIENDS: 8-year-old Mac has outgrown his imaginary friend, Bloo, and brings him to live at the titular organization. Mac must visit Bloo every day or he will get adopted out. They're joined in their hijinks by Madame Foster, her imaginary friend Mr. Harriman, her granddaughter Frankie, the lanky and friendly Wilt, the cuddly Eduardo, and bird-like Coco. (I disliked this show as a kid but love it as an adult. It teaches valuable life lessons and stuff)

Actual review:

I wanted something Halloween-themed for my classmates to watch in the background in animation class, but wasn't ready to commit to a full season of ""Courage."" Having watched Foster's as a kid and meaning to watch Samurai Jack for years, this seemed like a great opportunity.

The good:
-First 7 episodes of Samurai Jack, arguably CN's most serialized show ever
-Buy the first two volumes of this collection and you get the complete first season of Courage
-Foster's turned out not to be nearly as trashy as I thought it was as a kid. It was very enjoyable.

The cons (Very small nitpicks)
-Disc 2 of Foster's. You'll have to pay another $12 for the whole first season to get the other disc.
-Disc 2 of Courage. Not a problem if you intend to buy Volume 1 of this collection.
-Samurai Jack froze during episode 3 on my computer, despite being spotless. Played fine on my PS4
-DVD case just stacks all discs on top of each other like an early-2000s multi-CD PC game (Luckily I have some 4-disc cases laying around)
-Honestly... Kids Next Door wasn't great.

While it was a great hit of nostalgia, it just left me wanting to spend money on more Courage and Foster's (And I already planned to buy the Samurai Jack blu-ray collection). Not necessarily a bad thing.

And a warning: DO NOT BUY VOLUME 3 OF THIS COLLECTION (Dexter's Lab/Kids Next Door)",1507334400,,3556,4.919866444073456

However, as an adult female married to a loving and superb husband who enjoys some of these cartoons, I bought these as a perfect way to stimulate my visionary and imaginative side and simultaneously as a way to bond even more with my husband as we eat dinner together.  The 4 kid favorites The hall of fame collection vol. 2 by various (Cartoon network) feature the following cartoons; samurai jack, courage the cowardly dog, codename kids next door sooper hugest missions, and fosters home for imaginary friends.  The back of the dvd lists a summary for those who may not have watched one and/or any of these shows previously. Additionally, shows such as fosters home for imaginary friends and codename kids have special features. Samurai Jack has creator commentary while courage the cowardly dog part two (one of my husbands favorite cartoons on this dvd) is listed without special features, but has at least 5 episodes.",1420675200,,1070,4.873626373626373
