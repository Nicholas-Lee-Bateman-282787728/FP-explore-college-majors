8034253,1,B0002XN13I,"I was very disappointed with the Sugarfoot DVD.  I thought it would be a DVD with several episodes of Sugarfoot, instead it was one of him and one of U.S. Marshall.  The fact that it was sent to me in a paperback cover instead of a hard plastic case was also disappointing.  It reminds me of the Jerry Lewis ""Hardly Working"" DVD I received months ago, it was shipped in a small envelope and the quality of the DVD was terrible.  It had to be a second or third generation of a VHS tape that was transferred to a DVD.  The audio was too low and the video wasn't clear.  I couldn't send it back because I don't know where it came from.",1403740800,3,632,4.097560975609756

A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO WATCH TOGETHER!",1335484800,3,107,4.4
8034255,2,B0002XN13I,"This dvd was fun. It is a late 50's viewing of both shows.
According to the inside paperwork...this real price was from a dollar bin. Of course you'd have to find it to pay that price.
I am glad I got to see it...but I'd check for the air date next time.",1188777600,7,254,3.9038461538461537
