( ONE PIECE DESCRIPTION )

Fish are not friends when they're violent pirates! Gathered in the tranquil Sea Forest, Luffy and his crew learn the history of Fish-men and their struggle against oppression. Back then, the queen of Fish-man Island called for peaceful talks with surface-dwellers while others sought vengeance for years of slavery at the hands of cruel humans. But with every step of progress, an unforeseen tragedy deepened the cycle of hatred. Now, ignited by the flames of the past, the New Fish-man Pirates continue their crusade and threaten anyone who dares to ally with humans. Swallowing a mouthful of steroid drugs, their bloodthirsty captain, Hordy Jones, becomes an unstoppable force ready to decimate the royal guard. Determined to save the island and his crew, Luffy makes a decision that could turn a good friend into foe.

( MY OPINIONS )
Pushing for 1500 or so episodes. ( unless the arcs are long like dressrosa ) We're on the 20 collection. So 20 to 55 or so collection and 2x if it's voyage. That's around 23-26 episodes for each set.
If they make that much.

NOTE * collection are plastic cases while voyage are hard paper. They stated that collection is cheaper, but my eyes don't see that. Whatever too me, I don't care.

If you think about it we should be twice as close to Japanese version. but we're twice as long instead. We agree on that. We also and I think that the voyage should add more episodes.
Voyage should be 22-26 episodes ( $40 )
Collection should be 45-50 episodes ( $60 )
Call me crazy, but I think it could work. I'd buy it. Something too think about right. Who knows it might happen.

NOTE * Still off by 263 Japanese Version episodes and counting.

( THE FAULT OF VOYAGE NOW )
I looked up the old season 1-3. There not cheap for most. Season 4-7 are easy but 1 is too pricey. but doesn't matter which one collection or voyage. Unless you own them already or just want the season 4 and up that's good. If you started on voyage from the beginning, don't stop. Early season are rare, expensive,not available or anything.but it's still worth it. But the prices do change so you may get lucky.

( GOOD TO KNOW )
One piece came out October 20, 1999 ( the manga ) July 19, 1997, the tv series ) 2 years after. Played on tv in 1998. Broadcasting it in Japan in 1999 and in 2004 in North America. That 5 years already behind. Funimation took over in 2007. Been playing for 13 years too date.
Voyage came out on September 16, 2008/ today 9 yrs.
Collection came out on July 26,2011/ today 6 yrs.
If this is confusing. Voyage had a 6 month gap from season 8 voyage 5 to season 9 voyage 1. 17 yrs. too get 540 episodes today. 20 yrs. too get 468 episodes today. ( from when one piece originally came out )
Voyage has a 1-2 month release while the collection has a 3-4 month release. ( hope they could shave a few weeks off release date ha )
Now if they keep this up, we'd be dead before it could finish the series. I'm determined to buy every one. I'm doing my part. As a 29 yr. old Iv been watching this half my life. This series is the biggest hit and longest anime other than cased closed.
In a 10 yr. plan would be another 640 episodes give or take. In case your wondering. No, Japan does not have box set of 25 or 50 episodes, collection or set dvd of 13 episodes of one piece from 600 And up just yet. However there are DVDs from 600-789 containing 5-6 episodes, but rather illegal product made in Malaysia. Though the originals are 3 episode on a disc. However they do not sell them unless you buy from Malaysia.

4705650,4,B005HVWW6C,"I don't know, it could even be 3D4W.  When the One Piece manga did the 2 year timeskip, it was actually only a 4 week break.  Now that we've finally reached the 2 year timeskip for the US DVD release, it will be almost exactly 6 months since the last DVD release.  At any rate, the story picks up right where it left off when the Straw Hat Pirates were whisked away in all directions by Kuma the Warlord.  One by one, the Straw Hats arrive back at the Shabondy Islands, to which the world definitely stands up and takes notice.  There is even a lowlife pirate and his crew who are trying to leverage the Straw Hats' formidable reputation by posing as them and recruiting other, stronger pirates.  But in the end, the real Straw Hats show what a difference 2 years makes and convince everyone else how pathetic the fakes are.
At any rate, the real Straw Hats (except for Luffy who looks the same as ever) now look quite a bit different than the old wanted posters the fakes are trying to copy.  Nami has grown out her formerly boyish hairstyle and looks like a supermodel.  Usopp has grown out his hair too but it doesn't make him look any more attractive.  Franky looks like he has a buzzcut (he actually has retractable hair) as well as huge new mechanical arms.  Sanji now parts his hair to the left instead of to the right and Zoro looks like he's lost his left eye.  Chopper has a new hat that is bigger than his whole body and Brook (having become a superstar rock guitarist) looks the part.
Once the crew is all back together at their ship, they elude their numerous pursuers and continue their undersea journey to Fishman Island, facing numerous new obstacles in their path (prompting them to show off the new combat abilities they gained during their 2 years apart).  They finally arrive at Fishman Island (separated into two groups as will become the frequent trend for the rest of the series) as this volume ends.",1491004800,11,1923,4.447293447293447

4705752,4,B005HVWW6C,"...to quote the Bon Jovi song, which seems appropriate for both the package picture and the overall plot of this volume.  I warned you back in Season 7 Voyage 2 that the episode in this volume (#483, I believe) was coming.  After an initially euphoric start to these episodes it starts getting really sad and really dark.  Just as in Season 7 Voyage 2, you no longer hope for the victory of Luffy and his friends and just hope that they can somehow escape with their lives.  And this time around, not everybody does.  Thanks to an old friend of Luffy's, the war between the pirates and the Marines comes to an end and thanks mainly to an important new friend who is Luffy's principal ally in the One Piece series currently, Luffy is able to get away at last.  This volume has only 11 episodes and I have a feeling that the filler episode that was cut off before we get into a series of flashback episodes in Voyage 4 is an episode we're probably not going to see.  It was a crossover episode featuring the Straw Hat Pirates and a then-new character named Toriko whose series is also being dubbed in the U.S. by Funimation.  Whether this was the pilot episode of Toriko or the 492nd episode of One Piece I cannot say and I figure that Funimation just wanted to avoid licensing complications and just leave the Toriko episode out of One Piece.",1468022400,4,1341,4.4227642276422765

Usually filler stories like these are somewhat lame, but this one's pretty good (not as good as the previous story arc, but still).

4705875,5,B005HVWW6C,"There are no words to describe this show except for Epic.  At first I thought this show was going to be a silly kid's show with not the best animation style.  After thinking this for many years, and mocking it for the always remembered 4kids version, I decided to take on the beast of an anime with 500+ episodes.  Best decision I have ever made.  It starts of really rocky at first, but once you reach Arlong park, the necessity to keep going urges you on.  After entering the grand line the story just gets better and better.  As the straw hat pirate's ship grows in experience and crew mates, my interest continues to grow.  Once I reached Water 7 there was no going back.  The story line that the author/mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, created is the most incredible tale I have ever heard.  Not only does the world make you forget all about your own, but the story and characters make you want to leave reality and join the Mugiwara (strawhat) crew.  No show or anime has ever made me feel this or at least to this extent.  I have now rewatched the whole show two times all the way through and have dragged a lot of my friends into this addictive tale.  They would have it no other way.  Oda is a master at story telling to the point where I was crying with every character and even over the loss of a certain ""nakama"" I never thought I would cry over.  The only other word is Brilliance.  Sheer Brilliance.  This show is my favorite anime of all time. I would say it is also in my favorite top 3 stories of all time, if not top 2. :)  Thank you for your brilliance, Oda, and for caring about us over here, Funimation. :)",1377129600,,1617,4.249180327868852

4705918,5,B005HVWW6C,"The Straw Hat Pirates have entered The Grand Line. They immediately encounter a great whale named Laboon. They have an ordeal where Luffy befriends the giant creature and promises to return to see him one day. After parting with Laboon, the Pirates arrive at Whiskey Peak. This town is very hospitable, but it is more than meets the eye. The town is controlled by a group of criminals called Baroque Works. There are many prominant people within the organization, and a devious plan in the works that will make one of the warlords of the seas the ruler of an entire kingdom. Luffy and his crew must help the Princess of Alabasta save her country.

This anime is incredible. It's got action, comedy, adventure, and suspense. The voice actors are all familiar to just about any casual or serious anime fan. This anime also has a lot of Dragonball-like fun in it. It's tons of fun to watch and keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Now that Funimation has started releasing One Piece in these box sets, it's more affordable than ever. Any fan of anime, or any fan of fun in general will find this series a breath of fresh air.

4705921,5,B005HVWW6C,"I have a hard time thinking of any other series in any genre that has continued to produce good episodes for such an extended period of time.  One Piece constantly puts Luffy and his crew in one bizarre situation after another and so far (up through Skypeia at any rate) it has not failed to entertain me.  Collection 3 is no different, and as always Funimation continues to do a great job with the English version (though I highly recommend watching the original Japanese version also).",1351209600,,487,4.651162790697675

The story is great.. despite the fact that luffy can be and is an idiot 95% of the time ,he has the respect.... for the most part,of his crew. He will help out in the most dangerous of situations even if your a complete stranger. He is quick in fist and slow in thought but he is capable of thinking things through....on ocassion. Zoro the swordsman.. Usopp the sharp shooter, Nami the navigator, Sanji the cook , Chopper the doctor plus three more that will introduce themselves later in the series(if your smart enough to drink the delicious kool aide that is onepiece),round out his pirate crew",1349568000,,728,4.564885496183206

8473695,4,B005HVWW6C,"Just to make things clear right away, there are only 11 episodes in this volume as Episode 542 was another One Piece/Toriko crossover that Funimation decided not to purchase and therefore is skipped.  Nevertheless, this volume is better than the last one since the main story of the Fishman Island arc is finally coming together.  The first half of this set continues with flashbacks centering on Fisher Tiger, Otohime, Jimbei, and Hordy Jones (the four characters pictured with Luffy on the package).  We see the origin of another character, Koala, the future Revolutionary and companion of Sabo, as she is rescued from slavery by Tiger.  Otohime's and Tiger's stories end in tragedy while Jimbei witnesses the breaking of Tiger's crew and becomes a Shichibukai in order to protect Fishman Island.  The second half of the set returns to the present as Luffy and Jimbei disagree about whether to go to war against Hordy, Hordy captures the royal family and proclaims himself the ruler of Fishman Island, and Vander Decken, bitter over Shirahoshi's rejection of him, sends a colossal battleship to destroy the island.  The final battle begins in the next volume.",1506902400,,1161,5.052356020942408
