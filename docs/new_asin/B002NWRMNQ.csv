8375490,5,B002NWRMNQ,"I have been a long time fan of Mr Brickman, what talent he has.  This DVD has to be one of my favorites.  The talent and callaboration on this from Adam Crossley, Jon Secada, Orla Fallon, Mark Masri, and the very beautiful voice of Melinda Doolittle is must to watch and listen to.  Of course Anne Cochran graces this concert as she does with Jim most of the time.  To listen to all of them sing the last song, is just beatuiful.  Added extra with the Tenors.  Filmed at Niagara Falls is an added touch.  This is one of those that you never get tired of watching and listening to.  I would highly recommend this DVD.  Enjoy it and God Bless.",1376524800,,641,4.231404958677686

8375492,5,B002NWRMNQ,"The dvd is out already. Just go to [...] and see for your self. package cd-dvd combo is less then [...].First of all about Jim, just when you think he can't out-do himself he certainly does. This DVD is a heaven to your ears and more. Mark Masri is a vocal angel. His song the face is such a wonderful addition to the bonus music. I hope to see more writing between him and Jim. Melinda Doolittle is a great addition to Jim's friends. Carnivale is by far one of my faves on it.",1253491200,,477,4.085106382978723
