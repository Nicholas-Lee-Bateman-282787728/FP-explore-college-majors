8555669,3,B004QT6S8Y,"I purchased this and some Kipper movies to help my grandson go to sleep at night. The CareBear movie is a cute movie, but it has that ""screecher"" little girl in it. Her screech is recorded to wake the CareBears. So instead of being a soothing movie it is too overstimulating. Kipper is much better. His soothing voice puts me to sleep.",1397692800,,335,4.419354838709677
