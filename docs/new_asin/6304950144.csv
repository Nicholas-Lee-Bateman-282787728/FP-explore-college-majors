A real  sleeper of a movie at the box office and video  store, but it blew me away.  YOU MUST  SEE THIS  MOVIE.  The write up on the video box does this  movie no credit  -- there is so much more here than you would think, reading the captions  and summary of the movie.",911260800,,396,4.273972602739726
946847,5,6304950144,"""Fall"" and ""After Fall, Winter"" are the second and third relationship movies written, directed, and starring Eric Schaeffer.  ""If Lucy Fell"" is the first and not really recommended by me.  I purchased ""Fall""  having first seen ""After Fall, Winter."" See ""Fall"" first.  Both movies are deeply intimate, brilliantly intelligent, and significantly darker than the Lucy movie.  ""Fall"" and ""After Fall, Winter"" are connected both by the main character and the story line. There is no such connection to ""If Lucy Fell.""  If you want two brilliantly intimate and erotic films that deal with people's harbored secrets, buy ""Fall"" and ""After Fall, Winter.""  Be advised though that ""After Fall, Winter"" is significantly darker, ie S&M, when dealing with those secrets.",1369612800,,757,5.310924369747899

946849,1,6304950144,"These glowing reviews look very very fake.  For one thing 89% of the reviews are 5 stars.  The Godfather, Cuckoos Nest, Annie Hall, Citizen Kane, none of these films had no more than 80% stars.  For another the reviews use a huge number of superlatives--AMAZING  BEST SCREENPLAY EVER  UNBELIEVABLE,  I AM IN LOVE WITH ERIC  yet seldom describe specifics about the movie.

I am 100% confident that the vast number of glowing  5 * reviews here were generated by the producers, creative, team, or someone hired by them to flood the site and raise the ranking.  I doubt it is illegal but it is pretty pathetic.

One important note:  Joe DeSalvo's photography is exquisite.  This is a beautifully shot movie.

It is difficult to find words to describe how horrible this movie is. I could only watch it in 7-10 minute chunks
since I became so uncomfortable from the the the, I don't know, it's just hard to watch.

From the get go Shiva is unlikeable, irritating, smug and kind of dim witted. That anyone sober or with an IQ over 60 would fall for his smarmy pickup routine is absurd.

The dialogue sounds like the writer spent a long weekend talking to himself on Dragon Dictate.  Every character has the same voice.  The British super model talks about miracles like ""The 1986 Mets"" --huh? Shouldn't that be Shiva's line? A woman describes Shiva's pretty much rape of the model as ""worthy of an award"".

The ""poetry"" would make a 17th century fop cringe.  I'm not certain, but I think it is a felony in several states to mention ""the White Cliffs of Dover"" and ""The streets of Paris"" in the same verse.

There are so many coincidences you'd think Manhattan was a two block square.  People ""run into each other"" in the most out of the way places A LOT.  The story would only make sense a gullible 13 year old, old enough to know about ""those feelings"", young enough to still believe in fairy tales.

946851,5,6304950144,"This is a great love story, between a Taxi driver and a Supermodel.  That is of course an unlikey combination, but it really works in this movie, about this couple that is challenged by distance (she has to do the catwalk world wide) and he keeps driving taxis.  While she's out there in the world of glamour and make belief, he's firmly entrechend in the ""real"" everyday world meeting normal people in his cab.  That such a couple could have a future, coming from such different background and jobs makes the film all the more interesting and in a way even suspensful.  But its perhaps not as mundane as I may be describing it, as a few surprises do come along.  And, at least with me, I found myself always hoping that this (at times) long distance type of love could have a happy ending.
The acting is great and convincing and the fact that I hadn't see these actors before made it all the more refreshing. The story is set in NYC, probably the Mecca of the global model and fashion industry, so it natural that they meet here for the first time in his taxi.
Anyways, this is a lovely story and romantic movie, the only other that I ever found to be even better is ""Serependipity"" (with Kate Backinsale & John Cusack), which is more philosophical and intriguing because fate or coincidence plays a big role in it.  So go see this one, and if you haven't then also the masterpiece ""Serependipity""!",1268438400,,1399,4.466666666666667

946853,1,6304950144,"I won't say that Eric Schaffer doesn't have some filmmaking talent. He does.  It's just that it takes a backseat to an ego that demands full-frontal nudity in the first five and final five minutes and this man is not Brad Pitt.  He's not even Ben Stiller.  I won't even get into him trying to pass for 20-something.  It's well shot and unlike far too many films, does truly feel like NYC, but at the heart of it is this very unappealing man who wants you to believe he's irresistibly charming and could bag a supermodel (you'll have to suspend your disbelief to accept Amanda DeCadenet as a supermodel, though lovely she is) from the front seat of a cab. And if you've ever seen If Lucy Fell, you know this isn't the first time he's done this.  His ego is go great he actually tosses the film's basic premise out in the final act to cement his greatness.  It's on cable every other day.

946927,2,6304950144,"After seeing all the glowing 5-star reviews, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I ordered, received promptly, sat down to watch.. and expectently waited for the ""magic"" to unfold.

And I'm still waiting.

The first viewing I had to turn it off after about 20 mins because it was so utterly presumptuous with the characters and their ""destiny"" to be with each other. I know for a lot of things you necessarily need to suspend disbelief, but this was so far out in left field it was unwatchable.

After a few days I started considering I might have been a bit quick to write off the movie. Remembering all the ""88 5-star reviews"", with hardly any low-ratings I kept thinking ""it must get good later"".

So I sat down to watch it again. This time determined to make it to the end. So I watched. And waited. And continued to watch. Still waiting. Each scene taking me further and further into some kind of ridiculous alter-reality created by the director.. about a ""super-rich supermodel"" being helplessly attracted to a short, dumpy, half bald cabbie.. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me either.

So I finished the movie, and oddly enough, I thought the scene during the credits may have been one of the best in the movie. That left the most to the imagination, didn't have the director telling me what to believe, was a beautiful camera shot, great location, etc.

This film seemed to try to be ""Deja Vu"", but set in New York. But Deja Vu had better casting, believable characters, and a wholly more believable pretense.

Also, if you've never seen ""The English Patient"", do yourself a favor and watch that instead. Or at least in addition to this movie, so you can compare. In my opinion, English Patient is a much much better romantic movie. One that still chokes me up when I watch it.

946929,3,6304950144,"'The Fall' was basically about two characters: a little girl who purloined morphine from the medicine cabinet in a hospital somewhere for a very handsome parient (Lee Pace).  Their relationship was never defined or refined.  The movie's real characters were the beautiful landscapes in India which must have taken the twenty years it took Director Tarsem to finish producing.  In the meantime, he directed 'The Cell' which starred young Jake Thomas of Knoxville.

Finally, after the long wait for just the right female child, they completed all of the acting in three months.  Not a lot of interaction or conversation, as Catinca knew very little Americanized English.  Perhaps that is the allure and karma; she was not autistic in fact.  It was her first acting job and, like the young girl in 'Little Miss Sunshine,' who stole the show, it was her natural, low-key personality and ability to follow directions which made the story believeable.  I loved the locales (had no idea where some of the places are, but they kept me glued to my seat when the tedious ""nothingness"" took too long.

946930,5,6304950144,"I first saw Fall when a VHS promotional copy was given to me by a friend.  After the first viewing, I was hooked!  I soon turned my friends and family members on to the beauty and romance of this heartbreaking and soul searing film.  Eric Schaeffer's poetry is genius and his choice of songs brilliant!  I was thrilled when it finally was released on DVD.  For every hopeless romantic out there, Michael Shiver is their quest for the holy grail of love.",1179014400,2,453,4.475609756097561
946931,5,6304950144,"This rare, (hard to find) little gem of a film is another one of Eric Schaeffer's genius creations!!! (In my opinion, probably his best film to date) Why this film is obscure is a GREAT MYSTERY to me, but if you love raw honesty, tug-at-your-heartstrings drama, and have a playfully dark sense of humor, you'll LOVE it!!! It's tastefully erotic and will have you drop-jawed and panting well into the first hour, but holds so much heart you'll forget it's a little racy. Eric Schaeffer (who wrote, directed, and starred in this cult-classic romance), unravels the depths of human passion and frailty as the story unfolds. His poems/letters to Sarah throughout the film are emotionally riveting and will likely move you to tears. Beautifully written and exquisitely portrayed, this film (one of many screenplay's he's written) will leave you deeply moved and longing for more.

* I MUST mention the musical score for this little masterpiece. Amanda Kravat is a genius in her own right and her music (played throughout the movie) is unshakably haunting and can be found at Amazon.com under 2 CD's: Amanda Kravat - ""Wrong All Day"" (Has the song, Green / You can't touch me) and on her (since disbanded group): MarryMeJane under the CD of the same name. (For more info on Amanda Kravat go to MarryMeJane.com or AmandaKravat.com) Both CD's are worth EVERY PENNY, as is this DVD copy of Fall.

946932,5,6304950144,"**May contain spoliers**

This movie captures the feeling of love and the internal obsessions that go with it. And the heartbreak and longing that tear you apart when things don't work out.

By the way -- almost noone seems to have noticed that the ending is NOT hopeless at all. Michael talks about someday meeting up again and Sarah falling, then says how he has a Great God (as he says in the beginning), but this time he says that He really came out for him in the game -- and then follows a scene in the park with Michael and Sarah walking together and sitting on a park bench throughout the closing credits.

The letter at the end grabbed my attention the most as well as the music...

You either love this film or you don't...

Anyways, itneresting enough, in the sex scenes midway through the film, you hear the song ""Worlds Apart"" by Jars of Clay...

The song is totally a Christian song, but the song is torn apart to better suit the circumstances lol...

946934,1,6304950144,"This movie is a classic in terms of jaw-droppingly honest self-aggrandizement.  If you took everything out of an early 80's Woody Allen film EXCEPT the repugnant parts, you'd get ""Fall,"" and it's made me a devoted Eric Schaeffer fan.

What's so amazing about it all is the sheer self-centered wish-fulfillment that Schaeffer indulges in.  It's so cool!  Every single character in the movie exists only as a vehicle to convey to his character how incredibly great he is -and why not?!  He has two female friends who we know almost nothing about except that they're constantly impressed with his life and abilities as a lover.  He's got the supermodel lover who ultimately dumps him only because he's TOO cool, too hot, too real for her.

I'm not kidding.  You must see this.

Then there's the sex.  Schaeffer's character (who, like Shaeffer, is a NYC cab driver who had an affair with a married supermodel who ultimately dumped him) is so amazingly incredible as a lover that he makes his supermodel climax WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  If that's not cool enough, his two lady friends then spend time marveling at this, about how great it is that he did that WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  Wow!  Later, she actually  violates HIM with the aid of a toy, but once again it's HER who climaxes, thanks to his incredible dirty-talk and overall amazingness.  This guy's a dynamo, and thankfully there isn't a frame of the film that isn't devoted to showing that or having one of the other characters tell him that.

As I said, he gets dumped eventually, just like in real life.  But Schaeffer wants us to know the truth, that it's because he's too great and she's ultimately too shallow and loves him too intensely.  Schaeffer even imagines his lover's husband as a sexless idiot and gives him the line ""Maybe I'm shallow and superficial, but...""  The husband then goes on to acknowledge that he can't compete with whoever this incredible lover-man is, but that he'll ""be there"" if she changes her mind and chooses the shallow, easy path.  Eric's ""character"" is just THAT good.

For anyone who, like me, lives in a world where the only obstacles are the fact that some people resent how incredible I am and that the world revolves around me instead of them... this movie is for US!",1123891200,18,2259,4.711734693877551
946935,5,6304950144,"If you've never fallen hard, this film won't be for you.  It's for all the rest of us who have loved and lost.  Amanda De Cadenet isn't a natural actress, but she's filled with the joy of living and had wonderful reactions to everything.  She makes you believe that, even though she has the magnetic Phillipe in her corner, she might still feel a little bit empty inside when she wakes up in the morning.  As for Eric, well, the jury is out on him.  I have found that most movie fans (who have seen his work) hate him, especially if they are guys.  Women, it seems, have a higher Schaeffer tolerance.  I think he's great myself, but I can see how his manner might put off some people, plus if you're not from New York you're not going to get the whole Eric Schaeffer gestalt.  He's super talented and FALL, I think, is his best picture.

Genre fans remember the actor playing ""Philippe,"" Rudolf Martin, from his several appearances on Fox's ""24"" and prior to that, he made a memorable Dracula on the ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  Martin makes the role his own, here, and doesn't use any tricks to put across his version of the cuckolded European, bamboozled by Sarah's search for true love.

You might also like IF LUCY FELL if you like this one.  Schaeffer's more recent efforts inbclude the bizarre WIREY SPINDELL, which is sort of like what DECONSTRUCTING HARRY was for the career of Woody Allen, and the newish MIND THE GAP, nearly an anthology film like DEAD OF NIGHT or O HENRY'S FULL HOUSE.  FALL is another kettle of fish, a swooning, fullblown passionate romance; it's like something the late great Max Ophuls might have made in another era with Joan Fontaine and James Mason.",1116288000,15,1713,4.54071661237785
946936,5,6304950144,"From the first moment that my boyfriend brought this over for me to watch, I fell in love with FALL.  Eric Schaeffer is so charismatic and it's easy to see why she fell for him.  His poetry was so touching.  Their longing for eachother when they are far away and the excitement when they are together remind us all of what first love can be like.  Now that I have the DVD to replace the VHS that was on it's last leg, I know it will be watched over and over again.",1112832000,3,464,4.010869565217392
947016,4,6304950144,"Eric Schaeffer's follow up to ""If Lucy Fell"" (1996) has a maturity to it entirely different than ""Lucy.""  While Lucy was more of a juicy romantic comedy, Fall, which is not lacking in the laugh department, is a far more serious character study/analysis of an improbable romance and the effect it has on each of the parties involved in it.

Schaeffer always seems to be playing himself in his films (or at least always the same character) which is fine by me.  I always enjoy his work and his welcome combination of superego, no-nonsense directness and comic brilliance.

As supermodel Sarah, Ms. deCadenet gives a strong performance, slowly yielding, then coming 'round the bend and surprising herself by truly falling for Schaeffer's character, the charming cab driver, Michael.  But true to her word, she ends up breaking not only Michael's heart, but her own as well.

As always with an adulterous affair, things are bound to get messy and they do.  The acceptance of the affairs ultimate resolution by both characters is handled better than most romantic movies - a genre, I admittedly have little tolerance for.  Unless its an Eric Schaeffer ""romance"" of course!

Schaeffer has filled this screenplay with stunning poetry, which grows and blossoms in intensity until the final poem which ends the film providing an emotional climax that is entirely satisfying without being sappy or maudlin and never feeling manipulative or false.

As with ""Lucy"", look out for a very young Scarlett Johansson in the role of ""Little Girl.""

A quite remarkable little movie.",1109548800,27,1562,5.015503875968992

If you believe in Love...see this film.",1035417600,2,617,4.442477876106195
947096,5,6304950144,"Fall was one of those rare and hidden treats that I rented one night because I got bored with everything else.
What I saw was one of the most beautifully-shot, well-written and perhaps most-misunderstood films of the year. Eric Schaffer is PERFECT as the not-quite-James-Woods cabbie who picks up a supermodel and practically BEGS her for a date. When she FINALLY lets her guard down and they have some of most tense erotic moments, you think it's a pure skin-fest. It's not. Somehow, the two go past being sex-crazy to friends...and then friends to lovers.
Schaffer falls in love with her but you KNOW it's not going to work because of her boyfriend in Europe. That's the beauty of it all. You KNOW it's doomed from the start and the film REFUSES to take the easy way out. He foreshadows it all in the beginning, telling Sara, ""I don't fall alone"". Of course, we ALL smile at this warning, thinking that she's immune to his charms and that she can make it through a brief affair with this man in one piece. Truly, not the case.
It shows us that love is not something to be trifled with and when you fall inside of love's arms, it's almost impossible to break loose without hurting someone in the end. You shouldn't fall unless you are absolutely CERTAIN that the person you've fallen for is on the same page.
It's beautifully shot(with some truly beautiful cinematography and editing) and the writing is absolutely passionate, giving Schaffer a chance to show his feminine side and give us and idea of what his prose is like. Many critics and reviewers(off AND on the net) dismissed this as another Schaffer guy-fest and the chance to live out his ""masturbatory fantasies""(as one critic put it) but that's all a bunch of hooey. So what if Schaffer gets to make out with leading ladies(such as Sarah Jessica Parker in IF LUCY FELL) and supermodels(like Amanda in FALL and Elle McPherson in LUCY)! That sounds like a jealousy-issue to me! Exploiting women? I hardly think so. You don't see Elle, Sarah or Amanda complaining, do you? It's ACTING! A profession of professionals! And besides, you DO get to see full-frontal nudity on ERIC, as well!
That's why I say, IGNORE the critics. Most will see what they want from the wrong angle. If you look at this small winner in the right way as a true love-story and just watch these two star-crossed lovers live out their lives until that fateful ending, decide for yourself if you've just watched a cold, exploitive film or a film with true characters and explosive FEELING.
I bought this the VERY next day as a previously-viewed tape and unless Orion(are they STILL alive?) decides to release this movie again, everyone will miss out on one of the truly great romances of the last decade.

947097,5,6304950144,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this video as I had heard it was pretty graphic sexually. As a big Eric Schaeffer fan, I gave it a chance and was awed. The writing, the cinematography, the realistic yet fantastical premise all blew me away. Yes, the sexuality was somewhat intense, but it had a point and blended with the story. Very erotic but not sleezy. A funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking film. I am now convinced that Eric Schaeffer truly is a genius and knows how to throw you. See this movie.",1014768000,,505,4.5

Timing is everything I guess, yet this film has an ability  to evoke the magic, intensity and poetry of an all consuming affair.  The  writing creates a mood and pace that can possess an ability to sweep you  along; all the more so if you long for, or have experienced the shattered  hope this movie portrays.
My only problem with the film was the casting  of Amanda De Cadenet.  I have wondered whether the commercial failure of  the film was due in part to her being cast as the female lead.  She is so  ordinary, her voice so thick and clumsy that it renders her performance to  a level that is barely tolerable.  She is unable to make the character come  alive.  Admittely a difficult part, she posseses neither the ability nor  looks to be credible.  Fortunately Eric Schaeffer more than compensates  for her weakness in a film that highlights the high quality of  his  manifold capabilities.
Bottom line: If you've been dumped, broken hearted  or dreamed of being swept away get a copy to view.  Ignore Amanda and  enjoy.",967939200,,1117,4.615384615384615

It was extremely erotic without graphic nudity (except for Eric's refrigerator scene).  It  was truly an escape to a poetic romanticism that never tends to last in  real life.  This movie is for those who have been in love for a long time  and need a gentle reminder of that initial, undeniable magnetism that  brought you together.  It is also for those who have never been in love and  want to believe something so intense is possible.  Eric Schaeffer speaks to  the voyeur in all of us while playing to the exhibitionist in himself.  Incredibly riveting, irresistable and leaves you longing for more.

I am not a movie maker, and I may never have the passion this  movie displays on improbable love, not impossible love.  No love is  impossible, and Fall shows us how this can be.
