2568550,5,B000FIMFZU,Awesome video of the life of St Damien!  You won't be disappointed!  Robin Williams does a fantastic and respectful job of telling the life story of this amazing Saint!,1296086400,2,168,4.758620689655173
2568551,5,B000FIMFZU,"I have seen several videos on the life of Saint Damien de Veuster (a recent saint, elevated to sainthood on October  11, 2009), but I think this is by far the best.  Narrated by Robin Williams, it is a remarkable rendition, in humble language, of the struggles of Father Damien and the entire colony of the abanoned sufferers of Hansen's Disease.  I will watch this video again and again. I have recently visited the site of the leper colony on the island of Molokai, and believe this video to be an accurate, faithful and uncomplicated rendition of Father Damien's service there, and also some interesting followup testimonials.",1272412800,4,629,4.859813084112149
2568552,5,B000FIMFZU,"After two failed attempts to get this DVD from other sources, I finally have it and am VERY pleased.  It was a special gift for my husband since long ago, in high school, he considered becoming a priest because of Father Damien.  Needless to say, he isn't a priest, but the story of Father Damien is an inspiration to all.  I especially liked seeing the actual photographs of the people at the settlement and Father Damien himself.  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Thank you for the prompt service and the promised quality of the DVD.",1264982400,2,553,4.49
2568553,4,B000FIMFZU,"Using archival photographs and modern on-site film, this hour-long documentary provides a great introduction to the work of Fr. Damien on the Island of Molokai, Hawaii, with persons afflicted with leprosy.  His zeal for the Lord's work and his love for his parishioners are a very moving story.  While he is soon to be canonized (declared a saint officially in the Roman Catholic Church), members of that same church and of his own religious order did not always share his commitment to this population or endorse his methodology.  The outline of his life very much imitates that of Jesus; Fr. Damien took on the life of those ill with leprosy and sacrificed himself on their behalf.  This is similar to what Jesus did in the Incarnation.",1239667200,4,738,4.833333333333333
2568554,5,B000FIMFZU,"If you want more, the other documentary available at Amazon is my other documentary SIMPLE COURAGE, which was a PBS doc that explored the leprosy epidemic in Hawaii in the late 1800s and Father Damien's courageous and compassionate intervention.  Written by me, who also produced and directed it. It was an EMMY winner.  This piece is not a bio about Damien but more of a social history that looks back in this age of AIDS to ask what have we learned in 100 years.  These two disease have social parallels.  Fascinating and important history.",1227052800,,542,4.73404255319149
2568555,5,B000FIMFZU,"I write this only a few weeks after a big uproar over the political support of a Presidential candidate by a well-known Protestant pastor who has referred to the Roman Catholic Church as ""The Great Whore,"" an ""apostate church,"" the ""anti-Christ,"" and a ""false cult system.""  Once my wife and I were coming out of a Christian book store chatting with another customer about one of the items in the store.  We must have sounded somewhat righteous to her because she asked what church we attended.  When we told her we were Catholics, she was so stunned she literally could not talk, and nearly fell over.  It simply just couldn't register in her mind that any Catholic would find anything of interest in a 'Christian' book store.

This documentary should be required viewing for any Evangelical or Fundamentalist Protestant who thinks like that pastor or that book store customer.  Could there be any better example of Christian love than Fr. Damien who, by his love of his Savior was so willing to love literally 'the least of these?'  Didn't Christ Himself not say that there is no greater love than that of one who lays down his life for the sake of his Redeemer?

My wife and I thought this was an exceptionally well done documentary.  We could hardly believe a hour has so quickly passed.  Anyone who likes missionary stories will enjoy this program.  After seeing this program, don't forget to get 'Molokai: The Story Of Father Damien' as well.  That is a dramatization of his life.  Both are exceptional accounts of a dedicated Christian missionary.

2568556,5,B000FIMFZU,"Narrated by Robin Williams, this 60-minute film tells the story of the Flemish priest Damien de Veuster, better known as Father Damien, who followed God's call to serve the leper colony on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Beginning in 1866 the government segregated lepers to the barren island of Molokai where they were abandoned to hostile, isolated and horribly primitive conditions, with no housing or even potable water. In 1873, at the age of 33, Father Damien arrived to serve the 600 dispossessed people. Passionate, driven, and the object of baseless criticisms from Protestants, Father Damien provided for the material needs of the people (housing, food, medical care) as well as their spiritual needs. He even built their coffins and dug their graves. Sixteen years later, in 1889 he died there of leprosy. In 1995 Pope John Paul declared Father Damien ""blessed"" (beatified), which is the second of three stages to canonization as a saint.",1169596800,24,949,5.129032258064516
2568557,5,B000FIMFZU,"Having lived on the island of Molokai for several years and visited Kalaupapa a few times, this documentary was especially interesting to me. Several interviews are included, including some with Richard Marks, who is the actual tour guide of the Kalaupapa tour, which was very cool to see.

This documentary covers the life and experiences of Father Damien, a Belgian priest who lived and worked on Molokai for 16 years. He really is one of the finest examples of giving your life for the service of others. The history and the interviews show how Damien dedicated his life to making things better for the outcasts in the leper colony of Kalaupapa. He went to such lengths to work with them and give them the love and affection they needed, that he ended up contracting the illness himself.

An Uncommon Kindness also addresses the myths surrounding Damien that were spread by some in the church and by detractors of his practice. The filmmakers really did a thorough job of covering as much information as they could in an hour. Robin Williams does a fine job narrating the video. He provides the perfect amount of softness and storytelling into his narration.

All around this is a tremendous documentary, and if you're at all interested in the story of Father Damien, you should check it out.

""Worship God, Not Me."" - Father Damien",1169251200,30,1335,4.791304347826087
2568558,4,B000FIMFZU,"In the 1800s, a Belgian priest helped abandoned Polynesian lepers and died from the disease while assisting them.  He did this work despite laypeople, Protestant clergy, and Catholic clergy that tried to sabotage his efforts.

I had the mistaken belief that the Hawaiian leper colony was a helpful thing where all Anglophone lepers could seek assistance.  ""The Simpsons"" episode on the topic further clouded my view.  This documentary shows that this is all lies and that thankfully a cure for the illness was found in the 1940s.

The documentary may remind one of AIDS activists, both living and deceased, especially those who had or have the virus themselves.  Hearing of Father Damien also reminded me of my admiration for Father Desmond Tutu.  In a time when the Catholic Church is receiving bad press due to abuse accusations, this film may remind many of valiant clergy members of the past.

This film lacked the cheesy reenactments of most modern documentaries.  Instead, it showed the many paintings of the Father and his flock.  Some may find it hard to hear Robin Williams play a part in a serious subject.  I admit that this work made my eyes water and I think it is purposely meant to be a tearjerker.

The film begins with Belgians repatriating the Father's coffin to Europe.  Before this, I had only known of Native Americans asking the American government for their deceased and South Africans asking the French government for the remain of Sarah Bartmann/the Hottentot Venus.  In short, I've heard of people of color asking white leaders from remains.  Here it happens the other way around.  In the end, we learn that his remains are in both Belgium and Hawaii.

I only have two critiques of this work.  First, I am worried that it may rely upon ""great white hope"" ideas, the same that work in movies about white teachers in mostly-minority schools.  Yes, the Father deserves much praise.  However, colonialism and imperialism is to blame for the spread of leprosy among these indigenous peoples.  Native Hawaiians didn't want to abandon their sick relatives; white settlers demanded it.  Damien was helpful, but it would be nice if we didn't have an oppressive and white-supremacist past that allowed a tragedy like this to happen.  Secondly, all the academics interviewed were white.  I imagine that in the Hawaiian Islands there are several scholars of color who could have said profound things about the Father and the epidemic.  I would have liked to have heard their voices and seen their faces.

This documentary will be powerful for many:  Catholics, indigenous people, progressives, public health advocates, history buffs, and many others.  I am pleased to have learned about this important and selfless man.",1155427200,25,2733,4.986725663716814

8123384,5,B000FIMFZU,"EWTN aired  this documentary at least twice  shortly after the death of its narrator, Robin Williams. Presumably, it was not part of their regularly scheduled programming. But perhaps those in charge of that station recalled the 18 years of Williams' work with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital- a widely renowned Catholic charity-- as well as his championing the cause of the homeless and many other charities when paying homage to a Protestant who took his own life in that manner. Presumably many of them grew up enjoying the more sanitized aspects of his talent, and chose to acknowledge the almost universal lamentation of his loss in a way that was suitable to their industry.
  Here, Williams' lends his sotto voce-- as soronous and warm as the Hawaiian tropical breezes I knew so well as a child to this excellent recounting of the life of Joseph(""Jef"") DeVeuster  from his religious upbringing in his native Belgium, to his decision  to follow his brother, Auguste, known as father Pamphile into the priesthood. His sisters Pauline and Eugenie entered religious life as well.
  Taking the name of  Damien when ordained, his life's mission would be to bring order to the leper colony formed on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai in the region known as Kalaupapa as part of a strict government policy of segregating lepers from the rest of Hawaii's general population that began after a leprosy epidemic in 1872. The government had to round up those who showed signs of the disease and transfer them to Molokai, using the Biblical policy of segregating lepers  as justification for this. This documentary reveals that there was some resistance by  locals suspected of being infected.
  Initially there was no real organization for the colony. Food was sparse,  medical care  nonexistant,  shelter sparse, and criminal activity, rampant. There were some priests who ministered to the quarantined population on a basis of rotation to decrease the chances of their falling ill.
 But in 1873, Father Damien volunteered to be sent there, and we see his courageous journey to create an orderly colony for these outcasts, building shelters, and a hospital, and ministering to their spiritual needs.
 Photos of the lepers are, inevitably, difficult to look at. But they make viewers of this film appreciate Father Damien's work even more.
 Damien met opposition to his work, even slander by Protestants, although he was defended by author Robert Louis Stephenson.
 Still, he  gained the support of many, including one Protestant seeking to atone for a dissolute lifestyle.
 Most people will rally behind a worthy cause. Aid poured in from around the world.
 We learn how a group of nuns lead by Mother Marianne Cope would take over his work as he himself was succumbing to the disease.
 The process of Father Damien's canonization was not complete at the time  this documentary's first airing, but happily, has taken place since.
 There is discussion about the plight of  lepers on the island after his death, and their continuing struggle for dignity. Featured in regards to that issue is footage of lepers from that island in a story that I may have seen on the local news back in the late 1970s. It is mentioned how Father Damien's work currently inspires compassion for more modern social outcasts, namely AIDS victims.
 While I never visited Molokai during my years in Hawaii, I have stood before the statue of Damien in front of the Capitol building in Honolulu in  the process of being introduced to his story--a story that will be familiar to the average Hawaiian schoolchild.
  And so this tribute stands as a  memorial to both its narrator and the subject of the narration. While the priest was perhaps more consistent in his godliness, the actor, whom at best was one of Hollywood's most charitable men is justly remembered with as much love and compassion and lamented just as deeply.
 May they know the eternal peace of the Lord and may perpetual light shine upon them both.",1463097600,,3990,4.960843373493976
