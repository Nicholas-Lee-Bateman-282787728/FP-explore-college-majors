8417841,5,B00478ED4K,"In 1974 at Ronnie Scotts club in London, Oscar Peterson is playing. How I wish I'd been there! Fortunately for us they decided to film the session (in colour), and what I suppose are the best bits are released on this DVD. Peterson is in superb form, initially playing solo and then adding Niels Pederson on bass and finally Barney Kessell on Guitar to make a drummerless trio. The obvious highlight of the show is the boogie/blues piece that climaxes the session. Be prepared to have your jaw on the floor as Peterson tears up the Piano in ways that most pianists can only dream about...

The extras are as good as the main show, featuring an impressive Montreux performance from the 70's and a 1964 (black and white) session with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen, which is actually a Jazz 625 session, but not credited as such. This finishes with another showstopper ""Yours is my heart alone"". This set has been released previously as ""London Concert 1964"", and many years ago on video tape as the Jazz 625 show.

So as long as you don't already own or have copies in your collection, this is a fabulous DVD to get.",1304640000,4,1109,4.512437810945274
