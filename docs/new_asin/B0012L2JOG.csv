3092021,1,B0012L2JOG,I got this movie for a friend. He has always liked the Grateful Dead and Phish. He and I both hated this movie. He toured with the Dead and I didn't. The only common ground for us is that this movie blows!,1243555200,,205,3.9047619047619047

3092023,4,B0012L2JOG,"I will admit I did enjoy this mockumentary on the lives of 4 wandering musicieans searching for that great new sound. I'm pretty new to the jam scene. About 2 years ago I started listening to yonder mountain and bela fleck. Good stuff, but when I heard Les Claypool, musical genious, sat down and created a psychedelic jam band? I'm all ears.
This is a quality film about quality music. What got me was parts in the movie they interview people who talk about jam music, most of the people are really dumb unfortuantly. Like one lady says ""They play the regular song then go into 10 minutes of silliness that is creating new music that no ones ever heard before."" This makes me very angry because wow, isn't that what a musicians' job is? To create new music no ones ever heard before? So, if you enjoy watching Les Claypool make faces or you're a fan of jam festivals than this movie is for you. And even if you have no idea what an electric apricot it than I suggest you get this movie to inform yourself.",1237420800,,1006,4.3563829787234045
3092024,4,B0012L2JOG,"For those, like me, who are hippie folk, this movie captures the humor and seriousness of what it takes to become part of the festival jam scene. For a minute ther, I forgot it was a mockumentary. Kudos Les!!",1232496000,,208,4.358974358974359
3092025,1,B0012L2JOG,It took me two days sit through this whole thing. Mostly just unfunny interview situations. This is not a Spinal Tap for the jam band scene. It is more like a Weekend at Bernie's 2.,1224374400,,181,4.2
3092026,5,B0012L2JOG,"Claypool is a genius.  He shows it with everyting he does.  This is a very funny movie that could be enjoyed by most with a sense of humor.  However, if you're at all familiar with the jam band scence, you'll love it even more!",1220918400,,227,4.113636363636363
3092027,4,B0012L2JOG,"""Electric Apricot: Quest for Festeroo"" is an entertaining parody of the jamband scene. Electric Apricot is depicted as an up-and-coming jamband. Any jamband fan will instantly recognize the nods. The mockumentary pokes fun at the nutty tapers and concertgoers who keep the fan in fanatic. Whether coming from the band or their listeners, the scene's 'hippy trippyness' is a running joke. In this alternate reality, the Phil Zone becomes the Apricot Zone while Bonnaroo became Festeroo. Guitar player Gordo resembles Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule) while the similarities between Michael Kang (String Cheese Incident) and the keyboardist may be more than coincidental. At times, ""Quest for Festeroo"" stretches out to more mainstream references. For example, a nod is given to Metallica's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Kind-of-Monster/dp/B0006IIKS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Kind of Monster</a>"" with the inclusion of a band therapist. The Beatles' ""Let It Be"" is alluded to when one of the guys brings his girlfriend to a recording session. With an eerie resemblance to Yoko Ono, this outsider (played by Gabby La La) is often seen whispering into her boyfriend's ear. A police episode mimics the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COPS/dp/B000AGTQ68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COPS</a>. Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) is threaded throughout the film. At one point, Jerry is even put on the same level with Sasquatch, as a video taped sighting is shown. One of the strongest scenes is a takeoff on the day job; Lapdog's glass blowing episode is hilarious. The movie earns credibility with guest appearances by Mike Gordon (Phish), Bob Weir (Grateful Dead), Warren Haynes and Wavy Gravy. Les Claypool plays Lapdog, the band's drummer. Other notables include Seth Green (Dr. Evil's son in the Austin Powers films) and Matt Stone of South Park fame. In terms of the music, the ever catchy 'Burning Man' song will be burned into any viewer's head by the middle of the film. While 'Burning Man' may be the musical highlight, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B0013LL0CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>&nbsp;is a good accompaniment. As an inside joke, ""Quest for Festeroo"" will best be appreciated by those who the film lovingly mockuments. In other words, members of the non-jamband world shouldn't expect to ""get it."" Even compared to die-hard Primus listeners, this project will better resonate with Claypool's fans in the Oysterhead and Flying Frog Bridge camp. Already a novelist, song writer and accomplished musician, Les Claypool can proudly add actor and film maker to his resume. All in all, ""Electric Apricot: Quest for Festeroo"" is an entertaining parody of the jamband scene.",1211932800,14,2843,5.970588235294118

That's the catch of ""Electric Apricot""-- instead of spouting out snappy one-liners or head-scratching-strangeness, Claypool takes the time to take us along on his trip.

Comparable to ""This is Spinal Tap"", this mockumentary introduces us to Lapdog, Aiwass, Herschel and Gordo. Four random losers who have united as like-minded individuals to worship communally and musically at the common trajectory or one-ness that it related to music as an art form in its own consciousness.

Or something like that.

Claypool has put together perhaps his most memorable and entertaining project of the past decade (no offense to Primus fans). While it pokes fun at the jam-band scene, it does so with smirks and winks and not so much out-and-out parody. This flick is entertaining, often hilarious and more realistic than you would think.",1284249600,,992,5.07361963190184

The movie is also steeped with historic figures from Claypool/Primus lore, as well as South Park writers and a guest appearance by Matt Stone and Dian ""Squeak"" Bachar.  So there's lots here for the fanboy to appreciate.

I found the most entertaining thing to be Claypool himself.  In front of the camera, he's just hilarious.  Most of the other members seem like they're trying too hard to be wacky or quirky, but Claypool just riffs in a natural way that makes me wish he would act more.  Highlights include Les explaining why the lightning bolt in their logo is different than the Grateful Dead's, and the real meaning behind ""Pearl Jam"".  Kudos to National Lampoon for giving Les the opportunity to make this project without turning it into a lame fart-fest.  It's not a masterpiece, but hopefully it'll give Les some freedom in the future to do more in movies.",1279324800,,1159,4.788944723618091

I assumed that I would be the target audience for this movie, and I might have been.  I had reasonably good expectations for this movie.

There are some interesting cameos - Bob Weir of the Greatful Dead was a standout for me.  This movie just plodded and was never funny.  The band sucked (Les played drums) which is supposed to be funny.  However, Spinal Tap and Tenacious D suck in a particular way - where they are earnest and have ridiculous lyrics and the music is good enough to support that in a certain over the top way.  This band was just bad and was irritating to listen to.

I almost never turn off a movie before I finish watching it no matter how excruciating it is.  I made it to the end of this movie for some reason.  I kept waiting for a punch line that never came.

Well, I remember as it were a meal ago

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
May have nestled its way into his mighty throat
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down
The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator
Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did

She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days
The sight was beyond belief
Many a head snapped for double--even triple--takes as this vivacious
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most
Virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out

They hung in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place
And that was O'Malley's Alley

The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended)
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into
The heart of the alleyway
She knew what she wanted
She was lookin' for that stud bull
She was looking for that he cat
And that was me

Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee

Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?
Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?
Ah, baby, do you want to lay down with me?
Say, baby?
Say, baby?",1505692800,,1448,4.059649122807017
