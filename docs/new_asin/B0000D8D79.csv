They use still pictures while the story is going on - very very very low tech and didn't really capture my 2.5 year's attention very well. I found the cost of this dvd to be too expensive for what you get. Though, the included booklet with the complete story line is very useful, I think it's far too expensive for what it is. I would wait for something better.",1123891200,5,515,4.212121212121212
8026403,3,B0000D8D79,"this is a creative dvd with cute songs and story line. As stated above Korean words are repeated which is helpful for kids learning, however,i would like to mention for those of you interested in buying this dvd, someone will be needed to interpret the story. I would think that amazon would carry Level 1 of Billy and Boo if they are offering Level 2, unfortunately this could not be found. ??????hmmmm",1082419200,3,403,4.611111111111111
8026404,5,B0000D8D79,"This is a unique approach to teaching Korean. We like the fact that we did not have to force our 6 year old Korean American son to ""study"" his Korean. The story of Billy and Boo really captured his attention. He particularly enjoyed the scenes with the monsters. This video appears to have more educational value than other products we have seen from Korea. The lesson is well organized and viewers can pick up words and phrases because they are repeated often.",1066003200,4,461,4.634146341463414
