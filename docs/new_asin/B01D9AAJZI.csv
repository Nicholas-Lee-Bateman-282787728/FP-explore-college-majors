7704702,3,B01D9AAJZI,"Jamie (Elizabeth Rice) travels to Singapore to ""investigate"" her sister's death (Rayann Condy).  Not too much to investigate, she left her PC camera on as she placed a plastic bag over her head. Case close. Blame the ex-husband (Matthew Settle) kidnap the niece Katie (Adina Herz) go back to Chicago and then the ex can hire Liam Neeson to go find his daughter. Set a few guys on fire and  you got yourself a film. Nope. She hangs around and discovers that other people are killing themselves, their house is haunted, the ex-is really a nice guy and all the main characters all have some disease/condition.

The computer binary language is universal and this creates a new tower of Babel, but we still need the old one and an exorcism and an anagram. And how did Jamie get home so fast when Katie was in trouble. That was like across town in 2 seconds as if Singapore has no traffic.

This film is being renamed ""The Faith of Anna Waters""  perhaps to avoid confusion with other films of that title. The acting was not convincing. Adina Herz was not a good fit for the role. 3 stars is generous.

Now the good news. There was no swearing sex or nudity in the film. Now if I had a young girl I would let her/her friends watch this film while I quietly would place a picture of the Tower of Babel in her closet. Sorry, that's how our family rolls.",1462752000,10,1344,4.377510040160643

Says sequel to me and it would be welcomed.  I was ready for a good solid movie and this one delivered for me this Sunday afteroon complete with several good jump scares and I had to rewind twice to look at the....oops, almost spoiled it for you.  Plenty of solid bloody gore for me in strategic places not through the entire movie which was good enough for me.  Actors all quite solid, I do highly recommend this to anyone having the same taste in horror movies as me.

7704733,3,B01D9AAJZI,"Frequently incoherent mix of ghost story and religious horror set in Singapore relies way too heavily on jump shocks but manages some creepy moments anyway.  An American reporter travels to Singapore after her sister webcams herself committing suicide by self-asphyxiation.  For some reason, her young daughter is convinced that mom is coming back after 7 days.

During her investigation, the reporter uncovers a similar suicide that was filmed with a nanny cam.  That woman also promised to come back after 7 days.

Meanwhile, there's also a failed exorcism that opens the film and church websites being vandalized with references to the Tower of Babylon.

How does this all tie together?  Not so well, unfortunately, but The Offering (or The Faith of Anna Walters, as this one is also known) still qualifies as above average and delivers a decent number of cheap chills, as well as a pretty badly constructed story that creates pacing problems in the second half after it becomes clear the movie isn't really headed anywhere.  This one could have been a lot better than it is, but The Offering is watchable enough considering the sea of mostly dreadful straight to video horror flicks it shares space with.  I wish it were more, but sometimes not being terrible is almost good enough.",1479340800,,1286,4.97196261682243

The story and concepts are current and relevant; however, the acting was horrid! The beginning was a bit freaky and escalated my interest until acting beyond one scene was required. There didn't seem to be any chemistry between any of the characters. It was like watching the actors play their characters individually without any connection to the other actors' characters.

So we vary quite a bit. That being said my wife and I found a rare night alone with no kids and wanted to watch something that had a new idea behind it. Honestly, this one does. Tower of Babel and a computer. No one has done that as far as I know, so it gets high marks for originality. It does go into some clich&eacute;s and it does use some of the same formula as other horror movies, but they all are like that now, aren't they. For a night alone with my wife, without kids, I love it when she jumps. It reminds me of dating and the theater movies I used to take her too. She spilled the popcorn twice.

Adding in the ""demon"" who makes connections via computer coding through hacking could have defiantly taking on a new millennial approach to your average possession movie, but instead was never fully explained and left the viewer feeling more confused and rather less of a plot twist. All and all I could never decide if I was watching a ghost story, a possession story, or a teen slasher movie amplified by the use of computers. I think had the story line been more developed from start to finish in full detail at what was trying to be conveyed rather then quickly changing the topic/ scenes and forgetting about certain characters through out several intervals in the movie the concept could have been something very interesting, but instead just felt like too many ideas thrown into one without any real direction.",1465257600,7,971,4.890909090909091

(Really, theres no other way to describe that sequence than exactly that.)  In fact, Id go so far as to say that it looks like the director set out to make sure that Singapores first Hollywood horror movie would fail as completely as it possible could.

7704794,1,B01D9AAJZI,"I watched this a week or so ago, hated it because it is truly a crap film, but I had too many criticisms to write a concise review.  Scrolling through newly released movies I happened to see it again and was compelled to write this - that's how terrible this movie is - just seeing its title filled me with so much disgust I had to write something.  DO NOT PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS.  IT IS A CONVOLUTED PIECE OF GARBAGE.
Anyone who says art (e.g. film) is completely and totally subjective as to whether it is good, bad, or mediocre, is full of it and has never thoughtfully considered the obtusity and ridiculousness of the aforementioned point of view.  There is such a thing as an objectively good film (in the artistically critical sense), there are films that aren't objectively good ""art"" but pass as entertainment/decent time-wasters, there are also films that are so hilariously bad they're almost good....

Then there is The Offering - this film is such a steaming pile that you couldn't even watch it with friends and make fun of it for a laugh.  It can't decide what type of film it wants to be, so I'll file it under the ""how on earth did anyone un-ironically like this film?""-genre.  This cluster f-- includes the following - 1) ghosts, 2) possession/ exorcism, 3) a demon named Leviathan (whose appearance is blatantly plagiarized from villains of the same name featured on the tv show Supernatural), 4) a demon NAMED Leviathan (anyone familiar with the Old Testament or Christian history is going to be driven nuts by this inexplicable choice of name), 5) evil trying to infect people via viral video/the internet, 6) *spoiler* characters arguing over who gets to commit suicide to test whether a video they saw on the internet about resurrection is real....before the kill an ill child.

I'll leave it there, don't waste money on this.  If you still have a masochistic curiosity compelling you to watch this film, because for some unfathomable reason it has three stars - be my guest, but you've been warned.",1464307200,4,2023,4.692090395480226

Their assumption seems to be that we are so utterly stupid, mindless, moronic that we'll actually enjoy his piece of idiocy.
I can suspend disbelief for the most outlandish horror, sci-fi and fantasy films if the filmmakers respect the fans enough to create something with an internal logic that actually holds together with characters who have an IQ above 100.

The reprobates who made this piece of garbage have no such respect.
Their characters have the intelligence of cockroaches and the motivation of store dummies.
The plot line is a jumble of dung piled so high it stinks to high heaven.
Their understanding of the basic biblical stories they draw upon nonexistent.

The premise is actually serviceable. It's a shame the execution is about as elegant, lively and beautiful as a rotted carcass.",1463616000,,917,4.909677419354839
7704802,1,B01D9AAJZI,"Stupid movie with a moronic plot.  Sneaky camera-pan scream scenes are all this movie has to offer.  And the replication of similar scenes from The Excorcist made me want to call John Walsh from FBI's most wanted and have the Producers, Writers and Actors put on the list.  This was one of the worst displays of copyrite infringment I've seen since my trip to Thailand.",1463529600,3,369,4.6461538461538465
7704803,1,B01D9AAJZI,"Holy crap this is awful-easily one of the WORST films of any genre I've ever seen. AND ""Phantasm,"" that lowest-budget indie classic, is my favorite horror film of all time so I'm no snob. THE ""ACTING""-my god I need an exorcism after watching these idiots: whose spouses, children etc. are they? The film's backers, etc?
THERE ARE NO ""SCARES"" contrary to any review you've read. NONE. NADA. ZILCH. And the child ""actor"" is so terrible you'll WISH Satan did exist and would incinerate her right off the screen.",1463443200,10,508,4.784090909090909

7704806,3,B01D9AAJZI,"The acting is awful and feels like you might be watching a read through before filming actually starts.  Seems odd that with everything going on, a sick 11-12 year old seems to disappear from the story all together until the script needs her again.  And none of the adults check on her for hours and what seems like days at a time o r seem overly concerned about what's happening.  It had a good creep factor and make me jump once or twice so I'm giving it 3 stars but it had potential to be a great movie just never gets there.  Wait for it on Prime.",1463011200,,551,4.121495327102804

8755197,2,B01D9AAJZI,"The characters were not fleshed out enough to ""care"" about them, and the story was somewhat disjointed.  The only saving grace was that the concept was an interesting take on the perils of technology via biblical passages.",1526688000,,222,5.0
8755198,1,B01D9AAJZI,"The movie is all over the place... Its starts with the tower of babel, suicides, then goes to a sea monster in a haunted house or something. Its in Chicago but then is in Asia?! The acting and effects are absolutely awful! The trailer editor took this pile of crap and gave it a strong concept. The actual director of this movie was a idiot! It's like they gave up on making an American horror movie and said lets give it to the Chinese! I love Asian horror like ""the ring"". This just an awful movie. Watch it if you want, I would suggest not to.",1525564800,,546,4.160377358490566

8755201,4,B01D9AAJZI,"OK I have to admit to jumping and yelling at least once. I liked it very good supernatural horror. A lot of interesting neuse to the story that I think made that much more interesting and scary. One criticism though, none of those adults should be parents. None of my children would ever have to scream that loud or make that much noise for my attention. Nor did I ever just leave them in a yard without periodically checking on them till they were over 18. Maybe because I was a single parent but it just seemed that little girl was left on her own way too much for what just happened to her.",1522195200,,593,4.2105263157894735
8755202,4,B01D9AAJZI,If you love a good movie where good wins over evil in the form of Demonic Possession you will enjoy this movie.  This movie had so many twists and turns you don't really realize it's a Demonic Possession until the plot is nearing the end.  I am never fond of demonic movies that involve children but this was a well written movie with a plot of near genius.  https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Q7CKpa9GL._SS300_.jpg,1521158400,,431,5.217391304347826
8755203,3,B01D9AAJZI,"Every bit of this I have seen in other horror films, but this is why we like the genre. You've got spinning heads, possession, useless bible trivia. a priest being crucified, creepy child, suicide, monsters, ghosts, computer hackers. What you DON'T have is the leviathan you promised. You had a chance for a BA monster, you did not do it. It tries to do too much, hence the 3 stars.",1520121600,,382,4.4714285714285715
