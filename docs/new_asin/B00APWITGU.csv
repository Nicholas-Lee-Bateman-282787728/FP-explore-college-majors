8555839,4,B00APWITGU,"DVD of 2004 concert plus CD EP of 6 otherwise  unreleased B-sides.  A bit of a mixed bag, but a lot more good than weak.

On the plus side, the concert sounds very good, the mix holding up to even a lot of volume.  A great set of songs, and some interesting interview snippets.

On the less great side Professional Widow is unaccountably censored, the volume suddenly dipped on offensive words.  Very weird, since elsewhere on the disc profanity and sexual references survive intact.  But this song -- which otherwise would arguably have been the highlight of the concert -- is rendered powerless by the odd and distracting cover-over of the words (and hard edge) that are the whole point.  Better to leave the song off entirely than include this version with its teeth removed.

Also, Tori seems less physically/facially expressive and emotional on a number of songs then Ive seen before or since.  Maybe the end of a long, exhausting tour?

On the other, other hand, the 6 song EP is a terrific extra, worth the price of admission alone, especially considering how cheap you can pick this up used.",1451088000,,1099,4.701570680628272
