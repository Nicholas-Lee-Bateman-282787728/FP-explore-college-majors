1673627,5,B00005V9J1,"This DVD took me for a ride, emotionally.

The three-way romantic interest between the main characters is good, and the story has some unexpected turns.  About the time I thought that I understood what was happening, something different would develop.

The story was cleverly executed, IMO.  It's definitely not a spy thriller, in terms of subterfuge / double-crossing etc, but it's also not totally straightforward.

There aren't any incredibly good special effects- nothing like that.  Rather, just some quite believable performances, interesting characters, and an interesting situation.

The last quarter or so, plus the ending, were more fast-paced than the rest.  The number of turns near the end left me feeling like I'd been through a bit of a wringer- you may find that especially true if you've begun to empathize with some of the characters.

Very enjoyable.",1315612800,,869,5.239130434782608
1673628,4,B00005V9J1,"A cleverly written story about corruption, seduction, betrayel and deceipt, Bryan Brown yet again turns out another stellar performance in another great aussie movie, set around the insurance game in Sydney. Ben (Tom Long from Two hands and The Dish), is a naive and impressionable young man from the bush. Having just moved to Sydney, he takes up his first jop in insurance. He is taken under the wing by a senior adjustor Kreisky (played by Brown, from many great films including Two Hands and Dirty Deeds). Ben becomes a pawn in an experiment that Kreisky has devised to earn some cash under the table along with his 'beneficiary' Ranconi (Claudia Karvan). As the story unfolds, the plot becomes thicker and more intriguing, culminating in a clever, surprising conclusion.

A great cast, led brilliantly by Brown, this is top 5 of my favourite of all Aussie films. Included in the special features is a trailer for the film, with two bonus trailers and cast and director interviews.

Any fan of Brown's must add this to their collection.",1163635200,7,1040,4.870056497175141
1673629,3,B00005V9J1,I initially watched this to see Claudia Karvan in a further role after she impressed me in The Secret Life of Us. I found that this film has strong characters with all three leads including Bryan Brown and Tom Long being equally effective. The story is well paced with constant development of the plot and a good ending. The DVD main film sounds and looks good with a reasonable making of feature. The trailer is standard theatre fodder. A cast biography may have helped. The excellent characterisations make the normally dull insurance office world seem very plausible. Good on yer blue.,1017964800,8,588,4.8316831683168315

7956226,4,B00005V9J1,The movie was good.  A rookie Insurance adjuster gets training from an older jaded man who has been with the company for years.  The trainer feels the rookie is doing quite well but he want him to get a little more finesse; although he has been doing well with the claims that he has handled.  Good story kind of like black & white guy. J70,1466812800,,340,4.2

7956229,1,B00005V9J1,"Boring. Outstandingly wooden performance by Tom Long. I have not seen.his work before and if this film is an example of his work, I hope to see no more of it. The pace.of the film was slow and sluggish, to the point I found myself dozing off. If you have a choice, choose the road less traveled and skip viewing, unless you like slow, sluggish, tedious, monotonous and boring.",1432512000,,376,4.463768115942029

7956232,3,B00005V9J1,"This was really a so-so movie.  It wasn't well written or particularly well acted.  The production values were average at best.  The only thing that made it palatable, indeed the only reason I watched it is because of Claudia Karvan.  She is beautiful and yet believable.  She played her part to near perfection.

It is just too bad that the rest of the film could not live up to that same standard.",1377993600,,399,4.472222222222222
