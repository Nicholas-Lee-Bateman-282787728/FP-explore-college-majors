8108332,4,B000ECX0BK,"This is a great documentary if you want to see that the real face of Opus Day, a very nice one, can shine through a dubious approach. The documentary comes after the ridiculous so-called ""controversy"" caused by Dan Brown's book, and the curiosity about the Work. Well, even when the documentarian tries to raise doubts or strange facts, the fundamental things remain: Opus Dei may have had bad apples among their ranks, but the Work is not ""secret"", or ""a cult"", or ""so powerful that you should be afraid"".

I'm not part of Opus Dei, but I encourage everyone to take a closer look into it. It's really a very good order, mostly devoted to sanctify the work of lay people, and that makes it unique in many aspects.

Don't accept clichs about it. Watch this documentary and look into the things and people described here; read books about it (like John Allen's ""Opus Dei - and objective look behind the myths and reality of the most controversial force in the Catholic Church""), and maybe visit some Opus Dei centers to have your own opinions.

I'm taking one star out of the review because the approach could be less sensationalist at some points. Some things are not ""strange"" like it paints at all.",1356998400,4,1199,4.619718309859155
