Meanwhile, whales have found a previously untapped feeding ground where other animals used to visit to breed. Feeding frenzy. Insightful. Due to less ice a forest grew and a fire occurred where one never had before. This also allows fish to be where they had not previously been. Animals eating appears.",1471305600,,421,4.861111111111111

8682830,5,B00O9ZSHM0,"This is a 60 minute DVD with English subtitles.
It is a very instructive video on how the artic is changing. The photography and narration is done well.
This shows how solid ice is becoming open water and with that the polar bear is giving way to what is described as the most terrifying predator since Tyrannosaurus rex  the killer whale.
Inuit and western scientist are studying this changing situation. The Inuit tell of their experiences with hunting in this changing climate

At one point the narrator says it is not just the polar bear that relies on the ice  but then they fail to elaborate. The amazing hunting techniques of the killer whales are filmed especially on a narwhal pod that is completed wiped out by them.
This is a film that deals on the changing climate including showing areas of the tundra where wild fires are starting that have never been recorded before. The tribes in those areas do not even have a word for forest fire.
This is a film that is educational and will be of interest for anyone who wishes to learn more about the natural life in the north and especially the habits of killer whales (orcas).",1455926400,2,1132,4.566502463054187

8682832,5,B00O9ZSHM0,"This is a story of climate change. When the only barrier ice breaks and melts in the Arctic, the most ruthless hunting groups in the oceans, armed with the second largest brain in marine mammals, killer whales aka orcas travel some 2,500 miles in eight weeks, to hunt narwhals. Orcas are impacting the equation of the food chain at the top due to the alarming rate of melting snow in the Arctic when infact changes in the warmer waters usually happens from the bottom of the food chain and works its way up to the top of food chain. Orcas in the Arctic impact the survival of the old dominant killing machine the polar bear as well the Inuit where narwhals have always been the key to their survival due to the large amount of Vitamin C, an essential ingredient to human diet contained in narwhals skin. The changing climate is even forcing red fox to the territory of the arctic fox unlike anything else seen before beside the fact that the number of those beautiful polar bears have been shrinking in an alarming rate of 40% with the possibility of them getting on the endangered list if the climate change continues at the current rate.

This is a beautiful documentary about the Arctic. Well done cinematography in cold climates of melting snow and glaciers in vast open untouched habitats by humans except few Inuit and a wildlife that has been changing course since 2002 due to the climate change and melting snow. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1416441600,6,1441,4.62890625
