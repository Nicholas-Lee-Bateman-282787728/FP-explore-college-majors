1993018,4,B0001DB492,"I puchased this DVD upon release mainly because I wanted to show it to my Father who grew up in Sudbury around the 486th Bomb Group.
An important historical record preserved for the generatioins the DVD is well made although the main film is shorter than I had imagined.
It is good that the original WW2 Memphis Belle documentary is included and the photo galleries are a further good use of the DVD format capabilities.
The DVD is Region 0 coded and should play in UK machines ok.
Overall a fascinating film, sure to be of interest to anybody with an interest in military aviation and history of WW2.",1078704000,30,601,4.522935779816514

1993024,5,B0001DB492,"Just came back from Moody Air Force base air show.  Got to walk thru a B-17, and was surprised how actually cramped it was inside.  But everything was  original except for the seats for paying customers where the aft door gunners were. It was chilling indeed.
It was also sad to note the plane dripping hydraulic fuel under the wing.  Everyone was escaping the hot Georgia sun, and the volunteers had large absorption sheets to wipe up the fluids on the tarmac. It was kind of sad.

Of interest, Captain Bill Richardson you see in this film, was my 4th grade teacher. Had I only known.  The grief us snotty nosed kids gave him. If I had the choice of flying over Germany and facing flack batteries or snotty nosed 4th graders ....  give me the flack, please!
Cheers to you Bill.  Thanks for your service in the air, and behind a teachers desk.  A great man!",1446940800,,857,4.407643312101911

1993029,2,B0001DB492,"This had little to no coverage of the combat action that B-17s saw. This was not so much a documentary as it was one long infomercial pleading for the outlandish case of keeping B-17s in the air at an exorbitant cost just to indulge some people's nostalgia, sometimes. Any historical context to accompany the interviews would've gone a long way in making this more credible as an actual documentary.",1441152000,,399,4.797101449275362

The story was that he had to parachuted out of the plane; evidentially he was a good one because he was able to figure out which was France and which was German as he was floating to the ground.  He had to cut his lines of the parachute to guide it to France and not Germany; thus, broke both of his legs.  He was able to land on France.",1435449600,,377,3.8701298701298703

About a third of the way through I saw a picture of my father and his navigator of which, the photograph, I still have in my possession. I am deeply honored that my father was recognized though not by name. I was amazed of what my father would have thought about that picture now seen by perhaps millions around the world. I thank the producers of this documentary for their effort to tell the stories of pilots of these machines. The B17 (PR 42-97968) was delivered to Sudbury about half way through my fathers tour. The first half was with the B24 (PJ 42-52673). The name of both airplanes was ""Superstitious Aloysius""",1422489600,,683,4.560975609756097

Sadly, it does not provide much specific detail and I cannot recall seeing any in-cockpit footage, either from the War years or of the few still flying birds.

I am a big fan of WWII warbirds and the crews that flew them, but even with that, this film disappointed.  The production values were low, the subject material was extremely thin, and the theme of the film was never developed.  I guess all Instant Video downloads cost $1.99, even for prime members, but I still find it hard to believe Amazon charges money for productions such as these.",1378339200,,464,4.566265060240964

The story of the aircraft is interesting and the stories of the aircrews are amazing. Even into old age, their loyalty and pride regarding flying in these airplanes is obvious. Their eyes light up and tear up as they recall their exploits and those of fellow airmen lost in battle. Their respect for the durability of the B-17 is obvious as they talk about damaged planes that flew on and saved their lives.

And both viewings of the film left me wanting to know more about Roy Test, the fellow in the motor home.  He should have received a little documentary of his own.  He's been dead a few years now, but apparently he spent much time improving his community, and I suspect those who encountered him at the airshows he graced with his displays of WWII memorabilia would like knowing more.  I believe his obituary is still available on the Internet, and it suggests as much.  Regarding the film, I'm usually not picky when it comes to voice-over work, but somehow I found Susan Williams' well-delivered narration inappropriate for the subject matter, solely for her gender.
