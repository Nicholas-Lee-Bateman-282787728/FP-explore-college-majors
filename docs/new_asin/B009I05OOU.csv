8541714,5,B009I05OOU,I showed this to my college human sexuality class and my students loved it. They truly appreciated the diverse perspectives as far as age and LGBTQA status and were really fascinated by the historical perspectives offered by some of the older individuals interviewed. I will definitely be using this video when I teach this class again.,1443312000,8,336,5.017857142857143
8541715,3,B009I05OOU,"If you've seen and remember 'Word Is Out,' this is not 'W.i. O.' 2. While I remember every scene in the former as if it were yesterday, and learned from every one interviewed within it, a few months after having seen this documentary, I can barely recall its contents. The new HBO documentary is far better in this regard, but neither matches up to 'Word is Out.'",1375315200,4,363,4.432835820895522
