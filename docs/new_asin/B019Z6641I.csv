7587815,1,B019Z6641I,I have tried to watch this very dark thriller but had to give up. Instead of dubbing the French parts for English speaking audiences they have the subtitles. I just could not read that fast. The subtitles flash on the screen and are gone in a second. By the time you have read part of the first line the subtitle is gone. It was impossible to follow the story. If I was really into watching stuff that seems rather depressing then I might order the DVD so that it could be slowed down but I don't think it would be worth it for me. The world is dark enough and I don't need more stress.,1470528000,6,586,4.104347826086957

7587822,5,B019Z6641I,"THE TUNNEL leverages the concept of two preceding series, each called THE BRIDGE.  One was set in Denmark/Sweden, the second in the U.S./Mexico.  A dead body is found between the two countries and police officers from each collaborate on the solution of the case.  THE TUNNEL begins in the chunnel, with the discovery of a severed female body with mismatched parts.  The perpetrator is called TT, the truth terrorista serial killer who seeks to reinforce the truths (principally dealing with horrid injustices) of contemporary society.  The French detective is named Elise Wasserman, the English detective, Karl Roebuck.  They are played by Clemence Poesy and Stephen Dillane; each are superb.  In general the actors are not headliners moving from one British crime drama to another, but one of the joys of the series is seeing Tobi Bakare (Officer J.P. Hooper from DEATH IN PARADISE) playing a cognate role that is totally different in tone and level of seriousness.

This is dark drama.  Most of the daylight scenes are gray and foreboding and the fascinating environs of the channel tunnel (and the atmospherics of the constant travel between the countries) are heavy, industrial and grim.  This is all steel and concrete, heavy doors and dark pits.  Dont look for any bluebirds flying over the White Cliffs.

The ten episodes of the first season are 45 minutes in length, which I prefer, both for personal scheduling and, sometimes, binge watching.  The language is adult, sometimes a little more so than necessary.  (Wallander didn't require it, for example.)  The piledriver plot is riveting (to mix industrial metaphors) and the personal subplots are very engaging.  This is weighty stuff, the TT means business and the audience shouldnt expect too many blue skies.  Nevertheless, the production values, including some very interesting direction, are absolutely top-of-the-line.  Season twowith a completely different subjectis up next.

Highly recommended (but steel yourself for a dark trip).",1510617600,,2001,5.275316455696203

7587835,5,B019Z6641I,"Before I start my review of the Bluray version of this 10-part series which ran on PBS (the second season is airing now, though I haven't seen it), I want to caution you about reading reviews which provide too much info on the plot, as it will really spoil the enjoyment for you. If youve read my other mystery series reviews on Amazon, youll know I hate spoilers. But there are some things you SHOULD know before diving into spending time (about 7 1./2 hours!) watching.

First off, you should know that this is partly a mystery, and partly a police procedural crime series. The set up (not a spoiler, as it takes place before the opening credits!) is that a womans dead body is found in the middle of the Tunnel connecting Britain and France. Literally in the MIDDLE  with half the body in each country! This means that detectives in both countries are responsible for finding the perpetrator (who could be British or French). The lead detectives are the prime actors  neither of who I have seen before. The series is bi-lingual with most of the French police speaking in French (with easy to read subtitles), The lead detective on the French team ( Elise, played by Clemence PoesY0, speaks English when dealing with her British counterpart (Karl, played by Stephen Dillane) and his team. I found that some of the dialogue from the Brits, was sometimes hard to decipher (due to accents), so I watched with the optional full subtitles. You may not need, but its good to have them (also just one reason to watch the DVD or BD overseeing it on TV or streaming on line).

Next, I need to warn you that there strong graphic language, sex and nudity. But, more importantly, there is some really graphic violence, unlike any Ive seen in films made for TV.  Even though there is a warning at the beginning that this show may not be suitable for all audiences, you should be prepared for it. The package says it is rated TV-MA: (mature audiences), but thats an understatement, in my opinion. The show was produced for  and aired on  the commercial Sky-TV network in Europe. Each of the 10 episodes runs about 46-minutes in length. As I said, I did not see it on PBS in the US, but I cant believe it was not edited for language and some of the violent scenes. (As for sex, I thought it was a bit gratuitous, but it is supposed to be there for character development. There are a few sub plots which take up time, but are bearable.

Okay, thats all you need to know and I hope I didn't provide info that will detract from you experiencing the story. There are lots of surprises and you will probably find yourself binge watching. Unlike other series Ive watched lately, there are no previously on summaries or next on previews. This is wonderful and helps you enjoy the flow.  And, even though there is a second season, all the loose ends are tied up in the mystery and crimes in this season.

The home video versions have 20-minutes of bonus interviews  10 two-minute interviews with the two leads, the writer, the set designer, the director and more. Honestly, they didn't add a lot for me.

The BD and DVD of the Second Season  a completely different story  is out now and Im looking forward to watching that on home video.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7587871,2,B019Z6641I,"The series started off well, and, having seen the American version (The Bridge) it was fun to spot the parallels. The production is quite good. The protagonists are well-played.  But the villain is apparently some mix of Prof Moriarty, Nikolai Tesla, Jack Bauer, and Anonymous.  The assorted skills required commit the crimes depicted is staggering.

Possible spoilers:

There was no meaningful explanation of how the villain was able to pull off what he did (the trope of being part of some specially-trained group is so hand-wavey and cliche as to be laughable).  The absurdity soon became distracting.

On top of this much of the series is essentially a shaggy dog story.  It felt like two different stories jammed together.

It would have made for a much better (and shorter) series had it focused strictly on the personal vendetta aspect  and skipped the ""can you top this?"" series of pointlessly heinous events shown in the first 6 or whatever episodes.

Apparently the sun never shines near the English Channel.  The series felt somewhat like the American series ""The Killing"" but without the intense Gothic mood of that show.  This one is just bleak.",1472256000,7,1158,4.973958333333333
7587872,3,B019Z6641I,"The Tunnel is a French-British thriller that aired in ten 45-minute episodes in 2013 on Sky Atlantic in the UK and on Canal+ in France, then in 2016 in the United States. It was inspired by the Danish-Swedish series The Bridge (2011). To begin The Tunnel, the corpse of a murdered French MP is found at the midpoint of the Channel Tunnel, half in France and half in Great Britain. On the French side, Capitaine Elise Wassermann (Clmence Posy) is called to investigate. On the British side, DCI Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane) is assigned the case, which appears to be under French jurisdiction, as the head is in France. But, when the body is moved, it becomes apparent that it is actually two halves of two different bodies, the French MP and a young English prostitute. Wassermann and Roebuck will have to conduct the investigation jointly. The killer announces himself online, and promises to reveal Five Truths that he feels are social injustices, with more murders to come.

So The Tunnel is a race against the clock to find the killer whom the tabloids have dubbed The Truth Terrorist, before he completes his five truths and disappears into the night. One aspect of the story is the chase, which always lags well behind the villain. Another is the initially difficult relationship between the detectives, Roebuck being an affable middle-aged cop with several ex-wives and a young family, while Wassermann is a woman of little social grace. She is intended to be afflicted with some unnamed neurological disorder, presumably on the autism spectrum, which gives her a blunt, uncompromising manner. Beyond that, the writers introduce a few red herrings early on. Halfway through, it is at least clear who the Truth Terrorist is not. There are a lot of lose ends that are never tied, filler, and false leads. The writers keep the audience interested partly by creating a little cliffhanger at the end of each episode, many of which don't matter.

The story is beyond silly and quite violent- but I have to give it credit for generating interest over 7.5 hours. Im not sure how effective it would be viewed in longer segments, however. The presentation of Elise Wassermann is odd. She habitually has disheveled hair and a wardrobe to which she pays little attention. Then, in episode 8, Wasserman sports a neat updo, tight jeans, and wields a handgun. She looks and acts like an action star. The plot veers into international espionage in this episode. Then Elise is back to her mousy self in episode 9 and for the duration. Go figure. Its also curious that the detective heroes are essentially incompetent. The villain is in control, yet we are supposed to sympathize with the detectives, not the unseen villain. I don't think I ever found the detectives interesting so much as I got used to them. The Tunnel isn't actually good, but its entertaining enough, if you want light but violent fare. In English and French with English subtitles.",1472083200,11,2942,4.846918489065606

7587875,5,B019Z6641I,"I cannot exactly put my finger on it, but British (and in this case UK/French) detective series are different from U.S. generated series. They are quieter and develop slowly with intriguing characters and complex plots. They assume an audience that is smart and does not need to be told everything. AND they develop a deep sense of place with amazing photography of land- and cityscapes where the story takes place. This series does not disappoint in these elements. It is dark... very dark. On the darkness meter, I think of a couple of BBC productions -- The Wallander series with Kenneth Branagh produced by the BBC and based on the Swedish novels of Henning Mankell and the series Luther. On our side of the pond, I am reminded of Dexter. BUT, if you are OK with the darker side, it is intriguing and absolutely absorbing. My only critique would be that, on the DVD I have, the sound goes very low whenever there is dialogue, which is sometimes difficult with the range of English accents. What saves me is that some of the scenes in France have subtitles! But, as with many well-written and directed TV dramas (or Shakespeare, for that matter) you do your best to understand and then go with the flow (or watch it a second time.",1471564800,29,1233,4.609090909090909
7587876,3,B019Z6641I,"I really liked the character and plot development in the first 4 episodes or so.  The chemistry between Dillane and Posy is charming.  However now that I've seen the ending, I must say this really should have been a six or seven parter, not 10.  They introduce too many superfluous plot twists, and there's a ""climax"" in episode 9 that, though I won't spoil it, verges into laughable SNL ""MacGruber"" skit territory.  So bad it really ruined the whole series for me.  (Maybe Johnnie Cochran's famous rejoinder to the OJ Simpson trial will give you a clue...or the story of Cinderella.)  A lot of it becomes really predictable, as well.  It's as though the writers handed writing the last 5 episodes off to the interns or something.",1470787200,6,730,4.700787401574803

8746296,5,B019Z6641I,"Remakes of classics can be problematic.
For example, the American remake of the global Swedish hit ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was a pretty good movie but when stacked against the original it just didn't hold up. It was so universally panned by critics and the public - somewhat unfairly in my opinion - that the two follow-up films that had been scheduled were canned.
Given that, I was a little hesitant to watch ""The Tunnel"" because it is also a remake. In this case, it's a retooling of the Swedish-Danish detective gem ""The Bridge."" This English-French version, however, was wonderfully done and took just enough liberties with the original script to make it uniquely its own series. Starring Clemence Poesy as French police Capt. Elise Wasserman and Stephen Dillane as her English counterpart Detective Chief Inspector Karl Roebuck, ""The Tunnel"" explores not only a complex murder mystery but also a wide range of topics including marital infidelity, the difficulties of inter-agency cooperation on terrorism cases, the decaying fabric of social service institutions under increasingly conservative governments across the globe, the ""mob mentality"" of social media, and the ethics (or lack thereof) of tabloid journalism.
The plot contains enough red herrings to feed a small village and keeps the audience guessing about the identity - and the motivation - of the so-called ""Truth Terrorist"" until very nearly the end of the 10-part series. Jumping from character to character and location to location throughout the series, ""The Tunnel"" forces the viewer to stay actively engaged in the narrative. That is, I think, a real tribute to the writers, producers, and the directors because when done properly this is a wonderful technique but when handled badly it makes for programming that is so confusing it becomes unwatchable.
All of the characters are well handled in the narrative but I have to single out Poesy's portrayal of the socially awkward, laser-focused Wasserman as my favorite and tip my hat to the writers and the actress for making her one of the most memorable - and unique - detectives in fiction. That said, the writers took great pains to make all the characters, even those that played relatively minor roles, interesting men and women. That's not something that's always done and I again tip my hat in appreciation to the writers and producers for doing so in this series.
