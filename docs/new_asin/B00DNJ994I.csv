8607064,3,B00DNJ994I,"I read the ridiculous title and after skimming the clich plot assumed this must be a parody and surely not a film attempting to take itself seriously in the ""Haunted House"" horror genre. I was wrong, THIS IS NOT A COMEDY. The first thing I noticed that obviously dated the movie, circa 2007, was the antique cellular phone device(s) all the characters lugged around. Danielle and the neighbor girl ""Natalie"" looked good in bikinis but I got the sense the scene was written for the sake of showing young, beautiful girls scantily clad instead of propelling the plot forward. These questionable wardrobe decisions occur other times (Danielle being possessed (raped?) while wearing panties).

 I actually believe the dynamics between a vulnerable, distraught daughter and a clueless mother emotionally invested in a worthless spouse. Inexplicitly Danielle develops an understanding of the dark arts (when abandoned without parental supervision for a few days). With help (coercion?) from Natalie, Danielle reluctantly agrees to a Ouija sance session to channel the spirit of a famous actress ""Stephanie"" murdered by a boyfriend in the house a few years earlier.

When Stephanie makes contact, Natalie leaves the house fleeing from a petrified Danielle. Natalie returns the next morning and their misadventures continue.  Danielle repeatedly hallucinates visions from the murder. Danielle believes the deceased actress ""Stephanie"" has possessed Danielle in order to stop the murderer from killing again. (SPOILER! She's Right). For whatever reason the murderer is out of jail, I assume on bond, and in the middle of intense legal litigation. Danielle and Natalie go to the murderers house, of course, and the clich plot thickens... Needless to say vomit's regurgitated all over the camera lens (45 more minutes of movie to enjoy).",1381795200,,1826,5.351916376306621
