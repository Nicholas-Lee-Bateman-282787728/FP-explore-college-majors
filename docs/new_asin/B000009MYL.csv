7905538,3,B000009MYL,"Well, I'll try to elaborate. Simon Yam is a famous gigolo who attempts to help a new immigrant to succeed as a ""call girl"" (no fishnet stocking hookers here).  This is a playful Hong Kong remake of ""Pretty  Woman.""  There's little art (or nudity) here, but it's entertaining  fluff.  Yam is charming (and cheesy) and Carina Lau is his fine counterpart  in rentable love. Of course, there's a romance after the girl has been  taught the ropes and some minor conflict.  This film is a bit more  realistic than ""Pretty Woman,"" though both are fairy tales and  don't look at the gritty side of prostitution. In the end, it's okay.",957916800,,626,4.609090909090909
