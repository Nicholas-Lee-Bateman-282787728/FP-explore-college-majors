3936923,5,B002ITB3PM,"My girlfriend and i started watching this show a couple weeks ago and LOVED it.  Jemaine and Bret are so funny.  A few tv shows that i believe are hilarious is How I Met Your Mother, Chuck, The Office.  Im not saying that they have similar types of humor, but if you like these shows you will probably like FoTC.  They sing songs about there lives and its very catchy and humorous (deadly combination).  I was just in the market for both of these season so i was browsing around a few days earlier and stumbled up this from slickdeals. This is a great vaule for a great show",1278460800,,574,4.229357798165138
3936924,5,B002ITB3PM,"I love everything about Flight of the Conchords.  Everything. Except the fact they are not coming back for season 3. Of the two seasons, season 1 is better, but there are fantastic moments in season 2 as well (Jermaine becoming a prostitute, getting Garfunkled, the prime minister of New Zealand wanting to drive the tour bus). It's a very quirky show and not everyone will find it amusing, but I for one laugh out loud each time I watch it. And I have all of their songs available for purchase on ITunes on my IPod. I even saw them live in Atlanta last year and the live show is even better than the series. Love, love, love FOTC!",1278460800,,631,4.3474576271186445
3936925,5,B002ITB3PM,"This show delivers each and every episode.  With their unique blend of dry humor and surprisingly pleasant ""novelty band"" songs, it's hard not to keep a grin above your chin. I first saw their stand-up, and then had the privilege of stumbling across these DVDs after the show was all ready off the air(by the choice of Brett and Jermaine). I really enjoy all aspects of this show, and I wish they had signed on for additional seasons. Who knows, maybe they come back for more seasons like I think Larry David has done with Curb Your Enthusiasm. Splurge on yourself, you can't go wrong with this package.(Note:Limited Tracks on included Soundtrack)",1278460800,2,647,4.776785714285714
3936926,5,B002ITB3PM,"Two hapless and awkward New Zealanders move to New York City to try and strike it big as musicians as well as try to get a few girls in between gigs.  The humor is incredibly dead pan and the delivery often monotone, which makes the jokes even more laughable.
The songs spread throughout the show are never short of hilarious as well as excellently crafted.  They truly are musicians with a knack for creating a catchy beat and lyrics both absurd and comedic.  You could listen to the songs without even watching the show and have a grand enough time.  Songs such as ""Business Time"" with lines like ""I move very very clumsily, tripping sensously over my pants"" sung in a deep Barry White tone and ""Most Beautiful Girl"" with ""And when you're on the street, depending on the street, I bet you could be, in the top three most beautiful girls on the street...depending on the street"" make the show unique and genuinely funny.
One of the best shows that was ever on television.",1277078400,,972,4.537142857142857
3936927,5,B002ITB3PM,"Jermaine and Bret are a pair of New Zealand musicians, living in New York City and hoping to hit it big. Yeah, ""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Collection"" sounds like a terrible generic sitcom, but instead this series is one of the most hilarious comedies of the last decade -- a quirky, weird, tongue-in-cheek little show with hilarious dialogue. Think a musical version of ""The Office.""

Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.

As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a ""Yoko"", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), financial difficulties (Bret bought a cup!), jobs, muggings, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, the Crazy Doggz, Australians, epileptic terriers, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, hair gel, and a stage musical based on their misadventures.

If I had to come up with a description for ""Flight of the Conchords,"" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and ""The Office."" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.

The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, weird dreams) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, ""Albi the Racist Dragon""). The dialogue is amazing (""When I first met you you tried to have me deported from New Zealand because you thought I was an Australian""), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (""Have you ever had a threesome?"" ""Nearly."" ""What do you mean, nearly?"" ""I've had a twosome"").

The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, toothpaste, hip-hop spoofs, hermaphrodites (""Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies""), rappers, cannibalism, and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention ""Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring"" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.

But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.

This edition also comes with the ""Distant Future"" EP, which is a nice addition if not a full soundtrack -- it has the hilariously faux-seductive ""Business Time,"" the equally hysterical ""If You're Into It"" (""Is that what you're into/him and you, in the nude?""), the sad ""Not Crying,"" and live versions of ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the Room"", ""Banter,"" and ""Robots.""

""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Series"" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings. And boy, are you sorry when it's over.",1274659200,10,3590,5.093537414965986

3936932,5,B002ITB3PM,"Flight of the Conchords is a fantastically humorous tale of two dimwits from New Zealend who come to NYC to hit it big with their band.

Anyone who has watched HBO's Tenacious D will feel instantly at home with this show. However, this show is slightly different humor and the main characters seem to be the exact opposite of Jack Black. The show itself is better produced and higher quality, with more episodes and characters, it does a great job of crafting an interesting and fun universe for the viewer to grow comfortable with.

As with Tenacious D, the show is very music-based. Each episode has at least two songs w/ 'music videos' of varying catchy-ness and quality (but generally speaking, all are great). The music ranges from all genres but generally falls in the soft-rock category, even so, the show is definitely acting/comedy first and 'musical' second.

While the two dvd seasons are fantastic, the soundtrack is not complete (its actually their 'distant future' EP) and only has 5 tracks from the show. while it is a cool inclusion, but generally useless as a soundtrack itself and can be had for a couple dollars on other sites.

Personally, i love the show, however just want to warn everyone that this set, currently priced at 45, can be had cheaper if bought separately and was 20 on Black Friday Week of 2009.",1262908800,27,1331,4.724137931034483

The show is two singers from New Zealand trying to make it in America and their manager. They are generally poor and get into odd situations. There's one where they get mugged and end up sort of friends with the muggers by the end. They also have their one fan who is something of a stalker. The show also intersperses some of their songs which are generally intended to just be funny. Somehow it all just works.

If you like shows that are just a bit eschew and not quite normal, then you'll like this series. I'd kind of recommend you look up a few clips somewhere to have a better idea before you commit to buying the series, but it's quite enjoyable.",1377820800,,894,4.252941176470588

The series itself follows two New Zealand men aspiring to become famous musicians in New York.  The show is mostly about trying to just survive in New York with the help of their talent agent, Murray, and self-proclaimed biggest fan/stalker, Mel.  There are many comedic musical breaks during all the episodes that deals whatever current awkward situation(s) they are dealing with.  Bret and Jermaine's music is very catchys (one of my favorite songs is ""Too Many D*cks on the Dance Floor"" - Season 2, Episode 5... hilarious!).

All these adjectives and more apply to this relatively short-lived gem about a pair of New Zealand musicians trying to make it in the U.S. with the help of their manager, who also is a deputy cultural attache with the New Zealand consulate. New Zealand humor seems to be a rougher version of British humor, and it works an absolute treat.

I was given an 'expected' date of delivery, which through emails to my son, came and went without any delivery.

The main characters make a humorous pair and the supporting cast in quirky and funny, especially Rhys Darby.  While the show may be a bit slow-paced for people who prefer quicker comedy, I found this show to be really delightful to watch.  I bought a few copies to give as gifts and one for myself.

Includes all of the episodes from the two seasons of Flight of the Conchords

Fairly mainstream, accessible humor.  This collection has been a hit with a lot of my friends and family.

The Disappointing
Collection only includes the TV series and the HBO special.  The addition of the two FOTC music CDs would be worth paying a little more

Verdict
I've been thoroughly pleased with my purchase (Amazon likes to put it for sale in the 20 dollar range, making it a real smart buy).  Most people will enjoy the wacky, awkward, and oftentimes touching series, but if you're really on the fence the first episode of season two is available to stream online legally",1298332800,3,748,4.723076923076923

If not, then... I wouldn't!

3937061,5,B002ITB3PM,"These guys are funny. Kind of pricey at the time to purchase the complete series plus CD. The CD only has 6 songs. To save money I should have purchased the complete series without CD. The 6 songs are:

Business Time
If You're Into It
I'm Not Crying
The Most Beautiful Girl In The Room (Live)
Banter (Live)
Robots (Live)

I see the price for the complete series with CD is drastically reduced compared to what I paid. Whether you buy the complete series with or without the CD doesn't matter. You still get a good deal and looks like free shipping.",1294876800,2,548,4.362745098039215
3937062,4,B002ITB3PM,"A funny show that even if you have never seeany of it, will draw you in . A very rewatchable series with songs that get stuck in your head... it's Business Time......",1294876800,,166,4.21875

3937064,5,B002ITB3PM,Hilarious dry comedy. No problems with any of the products. Great CD to go along with the DVDs.,1286064000,,95,4.333333333333333
3937065,4,B002ITB3PM,People had been telling me to watch this show and I just got around to doing so.  I think that the 1st season was better than the 2nd one. Some of the music in the second season sucked in my opinion. The music in the 1st was really good.,1283644800,,237,3.836734693877551
3937066,3,B002ITB3PM,"""Flight of the Conchords"" combines the offbeat humor of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" with the colorful characters of ""The Office"" to come up with some very funny shows.  The dialogue often involves extended conversations that get weirder and more surreal as they go on -- not exactly the speedy repartee of Abbott & Costello's ""Who's On First?"" but a comedy blend comprised of a pinch of Jerry Seinfeld, a helping of Larry David, a few sprinkles of vaudeville, and several measures of Monty Python.

Bonus extras are plentiful and include a mini-documentary featuring Bret and Jermaine at their droll, deadpan best; ""Dave's Pawn Shop"" mock TV ads; snippets from meetings with the inept manager and his associate Greg; deleted scenes; and outtakes.",1282780800,4,739,5.049180327868853
3937067,4,B002ITB3PM,"Where to begin here? HBO released the first season  of this histercally funny show a while back. Then they released the Complete SECOND season.  Finally (well, almost) they released a package with both Seasons 1 AND 2 and added a CD of some of the soundtrack.  Well this time they have repackaged it AGAIN, replacing the Cd with ""new to DVD"" disc of their American TV debutin 2005  for HBO's One Night Stand  special. The special is just 25 minutes and has Bret and Jermaine on stage with their guitars singing song which never would have fit in the TV episodes because of length. The first one takes nearly nine minutes. Some are funnier than others - as you can tell from the live audience reaction - but its still fun to watch.

There are many other reviews out there about each of the two seasons and I agree (with most of them) in that Season One is more consistently funny than Season Two (but there are great moments in Season Two). I think this is the case with most TV series. The best ideas come in the first season. I've given this set four stars based on this.

Whether you need this set depends on whether you already have either (or both) of the previous packagings. The One Night Stand is for completists. And, if you've not seen ANY of the shows, this package might be an option.

3937068,5,B002ITB3PM,"After two seasons, Flight of the Conchords ended its run on HBO. The show, about a folk duo trying to survive in New York City, is quite honestly one of the funniest and inventive comedies I've ever seen on the small screen. Infused with great songs and a fantastic supporting cast, the Conchords rises above most other comedy shows you've most likely seen. The second season finds the show hitting its creative stride and is even funnier than the first with some hilarious cameos and better overall production value. Also included is a bonus cd with several of the Conchords hits recorded before they were well known.",1281312000,,618,4.785046728971962
3937069,5,B002ITB3PM,"This is funny stuff and both my husband and I enjoy watching it.  You love the charactors and the funny, odd things that happens within each episode.  It is fairly clean, original, clever, and of course, awesome!",1281225600,,212,4.702702702702703
3937070,4,B002ITB3PM,"I have always been a fan of satire, sarcasm and droll humor, and these guys got it right the first time. Their regular meetings with their manager, in which he takes roll of all three present, including himself, is reminiscent of ""The Office"" at its best. The ever-changing New Zealand posters on his wall, which generally try to distinguish their country from Australia, are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. And the jokes at Australia's expense are some of their best. Their music is all over the place in terms of style, but always very good and funny. ""Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor"" may be my favorite for its overall presentation. Their TV musical career is not taking off any time soon since they play to audiences as small as one.",1281225600,,748,4.674242424242424

3937072,5,B002ITB3PM,"This is a great bundle for those who like Flight of the Conchords.  It's witty, funny, and utterly enjoyable. Having both seasons and the music CD for a pretty reasonable price is great.  I highly recommend this.",1281139200,,212,4.702702702702703
8371138,5,B002ITB3PM,"Watched this first on HBO, loved it so much bought the DVDs, and have rewatched it many times since my purchase back in 2013. Great series, worth having. There is an extra of the two performing on stage some of the songs from their show. Great buy and nice little box case it comes in.",1502409600,,285,4.2
8371139,5,B002ITB3PM,Brett McKenzie and Jemaie Clement are both highly entertaining and talented individuals.  Combining music with comedy there is a harmony to this brand of humor.  Made for those who love parody's.,1499040000,,195,5.258064516129032
8371140,3,B002ITB3PM,"I used to love this series. Then I watched a couple episodes with my lady, and she pointed out that their whole shtick is to be emotionless. I realized she was exactly right, and rather than admit that, I never watched it with her again. I still secretly enjoy it though, if only to see Jemaine and Bret suffer.",1497657600,,311,4.288135593220339

8371144,5,B002ITB3PM,5 stars for the show.  I star for the packaging.  The show is great and the I thoroughly enjoy watching it again.  The package come with a stain on the box but under the shrink wrap.  Appears as if it was opened and then resealed since I cannot imagine any other way to stain the box while sealed.,1471737600,,297,4.068965517241379
8371145,5,B002ITB3PM,One of the funniest shows ever and the complete series is cheaper than buying each season plus it comes with a live dvd.,1470873600,,120,4.260869565217392
8371146,5,B002ITB3PM,"I am a big Flight of the Conchords fan, and recently realized that I do not have a copy of their show.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find a blu-ray variation and had to settle for the DVD.  While the picture quality is not as great as a blu-ray would be, the show quality is just as hilarious as I remembered it.  If you are a fan of any comedies such as Arrested Development, 30 Rock, Parks and Rec, etc., you will probably enjoy this as much as I do.  Every episode is a musical, and each song has its own humorous element.  I believe that this show is one of the best shows that aired on HBO (sorry, Game of Thrones).  Excellent comedy and worth the buy!",1466985600,,659,4.109375
