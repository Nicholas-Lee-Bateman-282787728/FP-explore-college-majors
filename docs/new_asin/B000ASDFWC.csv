8079700,5,B000ASDFWC,"It started off slow, but after the second episode I was hooked. I'm a big Firefly fan and this isn't as good, but its definitely worth viewing.  The small core cast grows on you and the bounty hunter element gives it a lot of room with regard to creative plots. There is a good mix of drama and humor, and although the special effects are limited by today's standard, they did a great job with what they had.  The stodgy halographic computer mainframe and the video call that begins each episode are well done and add an element of uniqueness and personality to this series.",1255737600,,574,4.457142857142857
