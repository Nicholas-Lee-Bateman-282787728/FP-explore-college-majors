1393345,5,B000055WEA,Excellent mix of hip-hop culture with streetball flavor. Contains ill dunks and ankle breaking crossovers that makes you want to hit the rewind button numerous times. A great video to add to the basketball collection.,988588800,2,217,5.228571428571429
1393346,5,B000055WEA,"Ball Above All is a must have for any major hoop fan. It is filled with crazy moves and dunks which originated on the playgrounds. You will be rewinding the tape over and over watching the crazy moves, dunks, and alley-oops. Hoopstv.com really knows their hoops, they put out a great video. If you love streetball style basketball this video is a must have.",988416000,2,357,4.59375
1393347,4,B000055WEA,"I'll admit it, I love basketball. I LIVE for the NBA and NCAA seasons to start. There's nothing better than sitting in front of a projector watching art on the hardwood.
I want to give nothing but the highest respect to HoopsTV.com for taking the time to put together the best of the purest artists on the courts. My roommate and I sat in front of the television with our mouths open in amazement. The detail to music and clips was phenomenal, Sinbad was hysterical. I have to admit though, I could've lived without listening to Lil' Bow Wow.",983232000,2,542,4.484848484848484

1393349,4,B000055WEA,"This is a very good video, though fairly short. The moves were crazy, some of these guys are unreal. The major problem that I had with it was the footage quality. Though this is understandable, I wish the footage could have been better, it was very grainy in some parts, and hard to follow in others. However, besides that, this is a great buy.",980899200,4,344,4.390625
1393350,5,B000055WEA,"I was skeptical at best when I decided to throw down my info and order this video. I love the site but am much more used to seeing professional and college highlights. However I decided to take the chance and was totally rewarded with this great video. Anyone who loves basketball needs to own this. The highlights are unreal, the music is slamming and it captures the unique urban flavor of the site. The Steve Francis segment has to be seen twice to be believed, and although I wish they had more Rafer Alston ""Skip to My Lou"" Rucker highlites in their ""ode"", its just a great watch. I got mine last week and have watched it through 4 times already with a variety of my friends/teammates. I cannot wait for Volume Two. Now stop reading the reviews and just buy the thing, already! You won't be disappointed.",979516800,17,809,4.472972972972973
1393351,5,B000055WEA,"The playground highlights are ridiculous.  STEVE FRANCIS & ALLEN IVERSON both are shown breaking people down in this thing.  The show Francis in a pickup game purposely bounce the ball off his defender's head, then take him to the hole, off his head.  The dunks and handles you see on this tape is ridiculous.  They show a kid throw the ball off the glass and catch one on a guy's head...in a game.",979430400,8,398,4.410958904109589
1393352,5,B000055WEA,"This is an amazing video showing  incerdible play after play! Man, I didn't think people played ball like this, I find myself rewinding the video show much asking myself, ""HOW DID HE DO THAT""
 Please, if your a fan of basketball at all you owe it to yourself to buy this video.

7930891,4,B000055WEA,"Features slam dunks, blocked shots, and ball handling scenes with music being played. Includes gals, vehicles, and some survival tips. Famous faces appear and some tats are examined.",1475452800,,182,5.535714285714286
7930892,2,B000055WEA,"I was kinda disappointed in this dvd. I had previously read an online review about how the Steve Francis section was great, but honestly, it was nothing to write home about. All the dunks he had were pretty average;  he's had many more explosive dunks in NBA games. The other 'reputed'dunkers weren't 2 cents worth my time either. The only brief spark I saw on this otherwise uninspiring dvd was the  section of James White; dude's pretty talented but not even he could rescue this video from the fraudulent ""entertaining"" claims it made. If you badly want to see the 2- minute snippet of James White's acrobatic forays to the hoop, then maybe this dvd is worth purchasing. Other than that, bah humbug.",1134259200,,702,4.699186991869919
7930893,4,B000055WEA,"Well, this DVD was pretty sweet, except there wasn't as much dribbling as i would like to see...tho the dunks more than made up for it, and i'd liek to know if anyone knows who was the rapper that rapped 'la di da di, we liek to party...' during the section when they showed all the girls butts, thanks",1047600000,,302,4.135593220338983
7930894,1,B000055WEA,"LAME with a capital ""L""!  To everybody that is a serious baller, don't even touch this video. You will find no pleasure at all from this DVD! LAME!",1029542400,2,147,4.25
7930895,5,B000055WEA,"I got a bunch of gift certificates for christmas, and I stumbled upon this DVD gem...
The Steve Francis part is sick.  I must have watched it 37 times. The music is perfect and Steve goes unconscious for about 27 points, including several explosive dunks over multi defenders, bouncing the ball off a defender's head, perfect form jumpshots, behind the back dribbling infront of defender.  I'm not sure when this clip was taken but it was in a Pro City leage game. The clip is great, and steve is one of the best fundamental, unconsciously ballin' players of our time. I cannot watch this clip over enough times.
The James White dunk section is also pretty good.
A funny section on how to play pickup ball for a white dude. This part was pretty funny, and white people should find it helpful. They are rules you should know by now, but if you don't there they are.
The great white lie part was kinda lame. I was disappointed in this section. I couldn't tell if they were goofin' on them or if they really thought those were some tight moves. A few were tight, but some were very lame.
Everyone criticizing this video because it doesnt have rafer alston is dumb.  THere is a section on him but it was pretty much a done in a sad light, since in reality it is pretty sad, and rafer has gotten too much hype already and not lived up to it.  Sure he was a great ball handler, but there is more to basketball than that.  This video is centered around outrageous dunkers, playmakers, and players who Ball Above All. Competitors. Scorers. Atheletes.
Not some goofy little and-1-mix tape.",1013558400,3,1580,4.491289198606272
7930896,1,B000055WEA,I expected a And One type movie with J.D.'s music in the background. This movie wasn't even made by so so def it was made by some website. the pictures were fuzzy. I think next time JD puts his name on something he should actually review it first.,1010534400,,247,4.166666666666667

7930898,4,B000055WEA,"40 minutes in total, 20 minutes of bs, 20 minutes of sick moves n' plays.  Ball above all, sick dvd or vhs for ya'll.  Skip to my lou feature is just trash, while the steve francis feature deserved my cash. Ballaz from around the way, with a section on white boys who can play. Future of flight feature iz so so def, James White's windmills, through the legs and free throw line dunks left me trying to catch my breath.  If you put ball above all den dis be the dvd or vhs for ya'll.",997056000,,483,4.063157894736842
7930899,3,B000055WEA,"This could have been a great video except for the fact that it was a short video.  some of the spectacular plays were shown over and over again.  Replaying the same plays just made the tape seem longer than it was.  I have to admit though, there are some eye-popping plays on the tape(especially by Stevie Franchise), but if you want to buy this tape don't expect too much since it doesn't live up to it's expectations.",994377600,,419,4.415584415584416
7930900,2,B000055WEA,"What could have been an awesome video turned out to be more of just a one-hour advertisement for hoopstv.com.  The production is quite amateur and could have probably been done by anyone with a nice PC, digital camera, and access to some good hoop games.  The action to talking ratio is 50/50 which just seems like too much talking and not enough ballin'.  Borrow it from a friend and practice the cool moves.  I haven't seen them, but from what I've heard, the AND1 video sound a bit more promising.",993686400,,500,4.522222222222222
