8538195,4,B0099VV0DW,"Bob Steele (1907-1988) began to star in B westerns in 1927. In the 1940s, his career as a star cowboy began to fade and he accepted supporting roles for several decades. In this 1945 film, he stars as the adopted son of an Indian Agent who is killed during a robbery. He goes out to find the killer of his adopted father and to find his real father. He is able to identify his adopted father's killer by a ring and watch that the killer took from him. He can identify his natural father by means of another watch that his now dead mother had. The film has several comedy segments as was typical in the westerns of this era, as well as the ubiquitous fist fights, gun fights, and chases.",1446076800,,686,4.244274809160306
8538196,4,B0099VV0DW,"The print is all right, not crisp though. I saw this film as a child, what great fun to see it again. This one is from the fourties and not as good and convincing as the Bob Steele films from the thirties but it is all right, Bob Steele has great authority as usual, and oh what a voice. And many of the loveable b-western mainstay caracters are of course represented.",1376092800,,368,4.197183098591549
