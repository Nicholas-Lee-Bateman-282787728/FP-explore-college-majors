532337,3,6302995914,"This film is a great showcase of William Powell's and Myrna Loy's talent. They both shine, which makes up for any holes in the plot. The film successfully builds suspense, but it also stays short enough not to bore  its viewers.",948067200,15,228,4.560975609756097

532382,4,6302995914,Nice Movie. Anything with William Powell and Myrna Loy is a winner. Not quite the Thin Man but not far behind. Throw in Rosalind Russell and it's a very good movie.,1433721600,,164,4.32258064516129

532385,3,6302995914,"Not a bad little flick for an old who-dunnit -- and for being free through amazon prime. However, if you are a big fan of Powell and Loy as Nick and Nora and are thinking it will be as good as the Thin Man movies . . . lower your expectations.",1405641600,2,243,3.784313725490196
532386,3,6302995914,"Although this movie stars Powwel and Loy, unlike their other efforts, this is a serious drama.  Still, the movie is well crafted with a clever surprise ending.  The acting is very good as you'd expect, but Myrna Loy is very low key throughout the film.  It is definitely worth watching.",1396828800,2,286,4.68
532431,4,6302995914,"Absolutely wonderful story with two fabulous actors, Myrna Loy and William Powell.  Great chemistry between these two actors.  Definitely not disappointed by this one.",1396396800,,167,5.916666666666667

532434,5,6302995914,I absolutly LOVE Myrna Loy and William Powell together. These charecters are entirely different than the Thin Man charecters but they are every bit as good. This is a much more dramatic film than those others and I really enjoyed it!,1360108800,5,233,4.7073170731707314

532436,4,6302995914,"I enjoy old movies including black and white, 1930s and Myrna Loy, among others.  This was an entertaining drama that tells a lot about its time when compared to today's social/moral challenges",1356220800,,193,5.03125
532437,5,6302995914,"This warm and involving drama with one of the greatest screen couples in history has an elegance and class which more than make up for its somewhat pedestrian pacing. It works as both a marital drama and a crime film thanks to its two stars, William Powell and Myrna Loy, and some fabulously stylish 1930 art decor from Cedric Gibbons.

Powell is celebrated high-society defense attorney John Prentice, who gets as much press from the New York papers as anyone in town. It requires so much of his time and attention, however, that his lovely wife Evelyn (Myrna Loy) feels neglected. When he springs Nancy Harrison from a murder rap one mistake sets in motion another.

Rosalind Russell in her first role has a glamour to her as Mrs. Harrison often missing from her later performances. Loy is simply fabulous though as a wife and mother who has the trappings of happiness but not the man with which to share it. Her friend Amy (Una Merkel) urges her in the wrong direction also, which will lead to a blackmail attempt and a murder.

While it sounds explosive, it is more a mature film about a marriage than a courtroom drama. There are plenty of surprises and twists and turns, however, as a European vacation to repair the damage to the couple's marriage is delayed because Evelyn cannot allow young Judith (Isabel Jewell) to be convicted for a crime she has personal knowledge of. That's where the story has some surprises and twists which keep it interesting.

Cora Sue Collins is very sweet as the couples adorable daughter, Dorothy, and Isabel Jewell has some excellent moments in a sad role. It is Powell, and especially Loy who really shine here, however, giving the story written by W.E. Woodward and adapted for film by Lenore Coffee a warmth and sense of realism. The focus of two people who love each other but find their marriage in trouble is never lost thanks to the stars.

A fine film in the Powell/Loy catalog not to be missed by fans of the wonderful ""Thin Man"" series.",1194825600,5,1986,4.646723646723647
532438,5,6302995914,"I saw this movie last night and I have to say it was an excellent movie. I won't spoil it for you, but this movie have some moral views that still stands today. Such as pick good friend, and the grass is not always greener on the other side of the street.
William Powell and Myrna Loy work so well together, but in this movie Myrna Loy steals the show, she was vulnerable, sad, happy, sexy, and just great to look at.
What can you say about Myrna Loy, that was not already stated by others. She was a great actress, and very good looking, she is miss.
I won't spoil this movie for you, but I will say this is a great movie, with great moral values. I have watch it three time since I receive my copy four days ago.",1149465600,8,714,4.035211267605634
532439,3,6302995914,"In her film debut, Rosalind Russell plays Nancy Harrison, a woman who gets acquitted for manslaughter by her lawyer Powell - and the plot thickens......EVELYN PRENTICE demonstrated that Powell and Loy could enthrall audiences in a serious drama. In their third time out, Powell and Loy found themselves again involved with criminal doings, although not as Nick and Nora Charles!. The proceedings this time are more solemn, with less opportunity for fey humour and amusing sallies, the prevailing mood being somber.  Powell turned in a performance of considerable dignity in this film as he gets across to the audience the character of a seriously dedicated man of the law who pays the price for sacrificing his personal life with his wife and child to the exigencies of his career. Myrna Loy is charming and capable as usual in the title role, and Isabel Jewell is memorable in a key role. William K. Howard directed with an expert eye for the tensions implicit in the drama, and the excellent Lenore Coffee screenplay helped Howard put a lot a narrative punch into the film. A strong supporting cast includes Una Merkel, Jessie Ralph and Edward Brophy.",1017446400,31,1153,4.943298969072165
532440,4,6302995914,"I thought the movie was excellent.  I love ""mysteries"".  I enjoy trying to figure it out.  The only thing I was disappointed in were the holes that we left out of the story that I could have used to figure it  out.  Other than that, Powell and Loy, as always, we fantastic!",959126400,14,273,4.173076923076923

7833904,4,6302995914,A good script but the courtroom scene at the end would never be allowed to play out like that today.  Maybe it is accurate for its time (1934); I don't know.,1507075200,,157,4.064516129032258
7833905,5,6302995914,"great movie, myrna loy and william powell play well against each other.  this is not nick and nora charles, they play a more realisitic - albeit in hollywood but still very enjoyable to watch.  i've enjoyed william powell and myrna loy playing off the usual suspects lists of movies usually cited to watch including these actors.  i'd say this movie was top tier of the numerous movies seen with these actors together.

well worth the time spent viewing, i recommend very highly",1507075200,2,478,4.7926829268292686
