7913668,4,B00000JWGA,"This is not your typical travelogue.  If you are looking for a nice video of sights to see in Norway, this one is not for you.  There is no dialogue, only a little descriptive text before each section of the video.
The photography does a nice job of capturing the feel of what is a very beautiful, rugged and remote corner of Norway. You are not likely to visit Rogaland, not because it is not beautiful, but because it is hard to get to.  This film could help fill that gap in your Scandinavian travels or just give you a pleasant 48 minutes of farms and fjords.
All of the beautiful footage is set to music which sounds more New Age than Norwegian, but sets the tone of the visuals nicely. And the scenes themselves are rich with variety, from the quaint town of Stavenger, to farm fields, to the steepest, rockiest cliffs overhanging the crystal clear water below.
It is a meditative film - not filled with the intensity of travelers on a race from one touristy attraction to another.  Calming, yes; boring, not unless your favorite film character is Conan the Barbarian.
On the negative side, the editing could have stood a little more finesse.  Also, you are left with the impression that it never snows there.  How unfortunate.  Some of the same scenes shot in winter could have been spectacular.
Is it worth [item price]?  You bet.",1057795200,3,1338,4.545833333333333
