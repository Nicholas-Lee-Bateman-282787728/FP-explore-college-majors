8212869,4,B000UCDMHQ,I watched this a few years back and loved it it was so different and the language sounds awesome. I couldn't remember the name of the movie until i recently thought of the weird barrier they had for the holographic people. Sandy and Junior's voices are really beautiful i loved the singing. The CGI was something i have to say was a lot better than i thought it would be.,1267488000,,371,4.314285714285714
