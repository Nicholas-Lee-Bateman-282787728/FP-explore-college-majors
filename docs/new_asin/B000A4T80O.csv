2358382,4,B000A4T80O,"There is a ""burn"" to this yoga session in the repeation of the asanas. I thought for sure I would miss the seaside atmosphere but had no problem with this newer approach in his dvd. As usual his dvds have are IMHO beautifully and professionally excecuted and he has a wonderful presence and voice for voice-overing.

This dvd is for intermediate level at the very least because it starts of already at that level. Its not one of those warm-up slowly beginner prep dvds. Boat poses make up the immediate opening movements. I love this dvd as much as his others in its own way. However, I found the repetitons to be a bit overdone and uneccesary. At that point I use the opportunity to move into some other yoga asana or skip to the appropriate section for me.

There are soooo many yoga asanas could have worked here...DO SOMETHING ELSE..NEW! Rodney...and please Stop forward bending into eternity. If you want to work out your arms alot then all those ""push-up"" positions into slowupward/downward dog will suit you as well as the leg extentions while in downward dog. The corpse pose section when I first did this dvd is nice but a bit longer than I expected..perhaps because this was my first time experiencing it then.

I found that I finished the dvd with my spine and waistline feeling quite nicely warm and glowing. This I would say is from wide angle stretch done a bit differently than his usual. GREAT!.

Overall, I kept the dvd because of the benefits of the slow movement. I've been waiting for something new from Yee. The wide angle stretch version and timing really helps my back and flexibiity. I appreciate other parts of the dvd...just not past my own limit for boredom. I am pleased with the music and visual aesthetics of the dvd.",1135382400,6,1747,4.607717041800643
2358383,5,B000A4T80O,"This is a very slow movement yoga routine. It is not meant to be a ""Power Yoga"" style burn and sweat routine. Rodney Yee leads a beautifully orchastrated series of yoga moves that are meant to bring you inward and in touch with your body.

I disagree with the other reviewer that this is a beginner, easy practice. Moving slow and listening to your body can be a challenge in it's self ;o) You should have some basic knowledge of yoga postures since there is no instruction on the form of the postures.

Rodney starts off on the floor with some very slow, repeated movements using your core. He does a very creative version of spinal twist. He moves on to a series of very slow moving sun saluations with warrior and this is a wonderful way to get in touch and improve your practice of faster moving sun salutes. And again, a very creative version of thunderbolt. Then on to the floor for a series of forward bending, backward bending, and leg stretching. Again, very creative moves that I have not seen on any other yoga DVD. He usually repeats each movement 2-3 times. The practice is a little under an hour.

This is a wonderful practice by Rodney Yee. He is a beautiful human being (and has a beautful body) and leads a very creative yoga routine. I will use this DVD over and over again. (Plus, Amazon has it for a very good price!)

See my other reviews on Amazon for Yoga and Meditation DVD's and CD's.",1135296000,18,1409,4.407692307692308
2358384,4,B000A4T80O,I know this video received some negative feedback and so I was reluctant to purchase it. I'm a yoga instructor and I found Rodney's sequencing to be very original as well as some of the poses. Those who gave this negative feedback might be looking for a more active session. I like yoga both ways and this video is great for building strength and going within. I'm very happy with my purchase.,1132531200,36,393,4.472222222222222
2358385,5,B000A4T80O,"This new Rodney Yee yoga DVD gets me warmed up and I stay that way! This routine may not be as quick as others and doesnt use many highly challenging poses(cobra & boat puts the back to work though!)but I get to experience the poses fully and completely. I really get time to stretch and strengthen, not just burn calories by moving quickly from one pose to the next. This DVD has a place in my collection!",1132272000,8,406,4.285714285714286
2358386,4,B000A4T80O,"I gave this dvd 4 stars because Rodney's presentation, music, and instruction always deserve recognition, but this class was just too easy for anyone at an intermediate level and beyond. I was led to believe this was for all levels, but it is really a beginner's class. I have at least three of his dvds, Intermediate Yoga, Power Yoga, Yoga for Strength, and I am very impressed with his teaching style. This one disappointed me only because I saw it as a further challenge and it was not.

2358387,5,B000A4T80O,"Rodney Yee's Yoga Burn is tai chi meets yoga. While I can see why it would be too easy for more experienced yoga devotees, it's the perfect starter yoga program. In my case it's the perfect mix of stretching, relaxation, and toning. I've been recovering from back and neck injuries from a car accident, and although I didn't sustain serious injury, I have required time to heal. I did have to modify several of the moves, and had to stop and start, but I felt such a HUGE sense of accomplishment. I feel like I can regain what I lost-- this DVD is what I needed to get started; it gives me hope. The best part was the relaxation technique is at the end of the workout. This is a DVD for people who are beginning yoga or starting a diet and exercise regime and can't tolerate (or don't like) high impact aerobics. I believe this DVD would also be a wonderful alternate workout for those experienced in yoga, or those just wanting a way to relax after a stressful day. Thank you Rodney for providing the less initiated with a way to begin our yoga experience!",1127779200,15,1057,4.370558375634518
2358388,3,B000A4T80O,"This DVD is for beginners and will not provide a challenging practice for anyone who has been working with Power Yoga: Total Body or Energy Balance Yoga, two of Rodney Yee's other recent DVDs.  I was disappointed.  If you are looking for a practice that emphasizes basic postures, however, you will like this DVD.  Rodney Yee is a great teacher; ""Yoga Burn"" was probably not the best title for this particular practice, since it implies that the postures and pace are advanced. They aren't.",1125705600,138,490,4.809523809523809
2358389,3,B000A4T80O,"I will give Rodney Yee points for the graceful and meditative practice he offers his latest DVD, but I did not feel any burn. Much of the yoga practiced here in the US is too fast paced with an emphasis on athleticism but this workout was not challenging for me. I would have given it 3.5 stars but that is not an option. This is a good practice if you are feeling tired and stressed, but the claims of added muscle mass and bone density are definitely overstated. This might be a good starting point for people who do not want to do more advanced postures and would like to spend more time on perfecting basic asanas like Warrior I and cobbler's pose.

One quibble I have with his productions-- since he uses a voiceover, why can't he mirror his actions so that he provides more accurate instructions?

All in all, it is not a bad offering but if you would like a challenge with some meditative balancing postures, try Yoga Zone's Power Yoga. Lisa Matkin is a great instructor.",1125360000,6,978,4.427777777777778
2358390,5,B000A4T80O,"I did this one this morning, and I love it!  It's an hour and really is quite a bit different from Rodney's usual stuff...it's not that the poses are held any longer than usual, but they're executed really slowly (though not TOO slowly, at least for me, lol) and repeated 2-3x.

It's hard to describe, but it almost feels like a dance, the way he puts it all together...he's soooo graceful anyway, and this really showcases that fact.  I was able to get into wide-legged forward bend much deeper than I usually am able, and I think it's the way he sequences this pose with others...i.e., he twists (slowly, of course) to the right, holds the pose, drops down to the left with right arm extended overhead, turns into left one-legged forward bend, then comes through into wide-legged forward bend (hope I explained this well enough! lol). It's all done so gracefully it makes me want to be just as graceful.

Some of it felt pretty challenging...he does a very slow 10-count-up, 10-count-down cobra pose 3x that I really felt. He also does ""baby cobra"" pushing into downward dog (again, very slowly) with knees bent, gradually extending the knees into full downward dog. This one really felt good to me.

Also, there's an audio option to turn off all talking except for his announcing each pose as he goes into it...I didn't use it, but it's there for anyone who'd be interested in such a thing.

I usually do from 30 minutes to an hour of some kind of yoga a day, usually following my cardio or weights, or whatever I'm doing that day, and I found this to be at a moderate level for me. I really love the way it's all put together and the way it flows at a nice slow pace, yet still feels challenging enough in all the right places...can you tell I really like this one?",1125100800,269,1769,4.478260869565218

2358412,4,B000A4T80O,I love Rodney Yee's tapes. His instruction is crystal clear. I think this DVD is excellent except there is a part of the DVD where there is a lot of shoulder strain .I had to pause the DVD and shake out my shoulders then start up again. The rest of the DVD is challenging in a productive way.,1472860800,,292,4.051724137931035

2358414,4,B000A4T80O,"I like Rodney Yee videos. I have had many over the years. This is a really nice 1 hour long session that gives are really nice stretch. I personally wouldn't call it a burn, as I never work up a sweat as I do in some more intense yoga workouts. I find it great for a nice relaxing stretch if you are really active.

Rodney is a great instructor, and has a great, calming presence. He provides constant tips (pull your belly to your spine, tighten up your back leg, etc.) which I find very helpful. He also gives basic instruction as to what you should be thinking of in each pose (front leg at a 90 degree angle, back leg straight, belly pulled in, etc.) -- again, very helpful. The only real criticism I have is he doesn't use the Sanskrit names for the poses. I like to know the true names of the poses as I'm doing them (I can't remember all of them off the top of my head), so I wish he did that. Otherwise, I'm very pleased.",1453161600,,825,4.288461538461538

This video is great for someone looking for an all-body hatha-style workout. This sequence has a lot of hip openers and downward dogs. Other reviewers have described the pacing as ""slow,"" but for me it is just right. You will sweat doing this workout but you won't get winded.  This is a good addition to your rotation on days when you're looking for a peaceful, calming yoga session.

Not because it is extremely difficult but because he does not provide any instruction on how to properly do the moves. He is assuming prior knowledge with this video. I would honestly suggest that anyone looking to get into yoga take a few classes before attempting to do any yoga video because there is a serious risk for injury without some supervision until you get the basic moves and body awareness that is required to practice safely.

And it still maintains the peaceful and motivating atmosphere that Rodney Yee is so wonderful at creating. I love the different sessions that can either be done for a short specific workout or combined for a longer, more thorough practice.

2358503,5,B000A4T80O,"I am a huge fan of Rodney Yee's yoga workouts and this one has popped right to the top of the list of my favorites.  When I first began, I was concerned that it was going to be too easy and not much of a workout, despite the name.  However as each of the poses progressed, I actually began to work up a nice sweat and my heart rate was going.  And the meditation portion at the end of the workout got me so relaxed, I nearly fell asleep on the mat!

This workout doesn't have any advanced or even intermediate moves, but if you're not yet limber, some of the stretches will be a little challenging until your limbs have loosened up.  Plus with the slow pace and repetition of each of the moves means you have plenty of time to get it right.  As always, Yee has a soft, soothing voice that fits in with the workout without disrupting it and the background music is pleasant to listen to.  After having done many of his workouts numerous times, I never get bored with it like I do with other workout DVDs.

Overall I highly recommend this for any level--for beginners it will be a great challenge and for advanced it will be a great way to loosen up and unwind after a long day.  You can never go wrong with any of his workouts, and this is definitely one to keep on your shelf to use regularly!",1417305600,,1293,4.160642570281125

It does move slow but constantly and since it is 55 minutes, you get a good work out and love the relaxation at the end where others feel rushed.",1417046400,2,499,3.669811320754717
2358505,5,B000A4T80O,"I actually own this in the Power Yoga Collection set (sold here on Amazon) which also includes Power Yoga Total body.  This is an amazing series of yoga poses that have increased my flexibility, as well as my muscle tone/strength in my back and shoulders.  There are already numerous reviews that go through the workout in more detail, so I won't do that, but I did want to say that the benefits from adding this dvd to your workout collection is more than physical. The impact on my stress level and general feeling of well-being is tremendous and is one of the main reasons that I do this every other day. If you combine this with the Power Yoga Total Body, your health will benefit greatly.
A side note for anyone new to yoga or who may be feeling discouraged: If you are not sure how to align yourself in any of the poses or if you feel any pain, please take the time to look up the pose and study how you need to position yourself in it to avoid injury.  If you find it difficult, always modify until you feel you can hold the pose properly and safely.  Yoga isn't about the ego, it is about personal growth and that will come with practice.",1416700800,,1146,4.291666666666667

2358530,3,B000A4T80O,"I am usually a big fan of Rodney Yee.  I bought this to challenge my workout a bit and to work on strengthening my abs/core.  What I found is that Rodney starts to loose the mind/body/breath connection.  I have gone to yoga classes with much better thought out moves.  Sometimes he moves so fast in and out of asanas that I loose my inner focus.

The routine feels rushed. It also feels WESTERNIZED.  Like Rodney is trying get on the LA Burn power craze... which is NOT YOGA!!!  That is just my opinion.  I rarely use this video after buying it... as again I just feel rushed. There are many other Rodney Yee videos I prefer.

Also my belief is one does not have to pump the body hard or stand on your head in a neck stand to get benefits from yoga.  Yes head/neck stands etc. might be applicable to some.. but this routine seems to move from beginning to advanced postures.. In otherwords it feels like the routine is all over the place.

Sorry not my fav.

2358545,5,B000A4T80O,"I usually do a faster flow style Yoga.  This turns all that upside down and all around.  You move consciously and very slowly into each pose then you repeat the flow a few times.  I found the workout to be decently challenging and I consider myself an intermediately fit person.

The real benefit of this workout is in deliberately slowing yourself down while using your muscles in a new way.  It makes you pay attention to form, you feel each of your muscles as you move in and out of the poses.  It's also a good mental exercise on being present, in the moment, and paying attention to your body.  This workout is the opposite of hectic.  The opposite of the bounce around jump around like a jack-in-the box type workouts.  Although you will definitely feel the burn!!",1381536000,5,770,4.521739130434782

Not Yin but not cardio power yoga either - but just right.  Perfect for morning to waken up or night to unwind.  Rodney may be too Eastern or new age for some but if his calling the floor ""mother earth"" bothers you then you probably will not like this routine anyway. If I recall I think Camel might be the only pose that beginner might have trouble with other than fact that you are on your hands a lot holding poses so wrist issues might be something for beginners too.  As for intermediate  or advanced yogis, the beauty of yoga is you never out grow it and instead just go deeper in the pose and the long hold counts work beautifully for deepening into the moves for greater gains in flexibility. Folks if you are not feeling the burn IT IS YOU NOT MR. YEE'S ROUTINE that is the issue and  you need to go deeper into the pose and push your flexibility (gently) up against the wall of your ability and then you should feel the burn just like you increase your weights to heavier amount when 10-12 repetitions are to easy.

2358550,3,B000A4T80O,"This video features three sessions although I feel that it is really one session split into three. The first session called 'Connect' last 24 minutes and is a good workout for experienced beginners better yet intermediates. It moves fast (sun salutations, chatuangas and core work)and will raise a sweat. You must already know the poses or be aware that you will have to watch several times to understand what is being asked. The second session is called 'Energize' and lasts 17 minutes. You immediately go into a forward bend, a balance pose and then back bends/stretches for the majority of the session, finally counter exercises to rest pose. Be warm both physically and mentally before you start or you may over stretch your back. The third session is 'Meditation?' it lasts 14 minutes and is mostly a ground exercise of bends/folds, stretching, quick crow pose, calm breathing and relaxation. Quite nice; not challenging at all. I love Rodney's narrative and presentation as always; which is why I persevere with this DVD. I am a big fan of his 'Ultimate Power Yoga' and 'A.M.

The speed at which he instructs the student varies.  Sometimes, he is moving the student rapidly from one pose to another and other times he is speaking at a normal pace allowing you to get set in the pose.

I found it waaaay too fast, he did not indicated breathes, & it was confusing.  The location was beautiful...I even thought of returning it.

It took about one and a half weeks for the dvd to reach me, but it is in GREAT condition. I popped it in the dvd player thinking, ""I do Yoga, this will be a piece of cake."" WRONG!!! It is so INTENSE!!! I made it through half of the dvd and I had to quit. This is a great dvd though. It targets muscles I didn't even know I had. I recommend it to everyone. If you have back issues, this will help. It's way better than paying 100.00 three times a week to get your back adjusted.
In short...give it a try. Great price, fairly quick arrival...great product!!! :)",1299715200,2,568,4.0265486725663715
2358605,4,B000A4T80O,"This is a wonderful yoga dvd for all levels. I think it is difficult to find a yoga dvd that would work for everyone, but this may be it. It doesn't focus on the spiritual/cleansing side of yoga (e.g. no talk of letting go of negative energy or connecting to your inner self, chanting etc.) nor does it focus on only the physical benefits. Whether you look to yoga as a healing practice for the mind and soul or strictly as way to keep flexible and fit, this practice would appeal to you, as it allows for a natural, meditative calmness while providing some deep stretches.

The poses are fairly basic, though he does not offer detailed instruction on correct form. Therefore, if you're completely, completely new to yoga you may want to start elsewhere. However, I think so long as you have some understanding of body positioning and breath this dvd could work for you. Even though the poses are fairly basic, they offer a good stretch, and are not SO basic that they are boring for the advanced practitioner. I have done many, many yoga dvds that were too basic to hold my interest or to feel worthwhile, and this is not one of them.

Rodney Yee's instruction is very clear. Usually when I'm doing an exercise dvd for the first time I have to constantly look up to the screen to see what's going on. Very shortly into the exercise I found myself following along to his cuing and barely needing to look at the screen at all. This also made it easier to get into the yoga flow and make the process more relaxing and meditative.

My one, tiny gripe is that there's a small part where the video shot does not match with what is being said. It lasts about 5 seconds and then the image on the screen matches what he is doing again. His instruction moves on to a new exercise while the image repeats the previous movement. The video image moves back to what he is talking about while the new move is still being set up so it doesn't disrupt much. And after you realize this once you just end up ignoring it when you do the exercise again. Still, it's unfortunate to have this happen in a dvd that otherwise is superb.

(As a side note, I got this as part of a Rodney Yee Power Yoga Collection which includes this plus 2 additional 60 min. yoga workouts of Rodney Yee's on one dvd (Power Yoga Total Body and Yoga Conditioning for Athletes). It costs only a dollar or two more than any of the workout dvds individually and they're all fantastic workouts. GREAT value!)",1299628800,4,2461,4.4021978021978025

2358630,5,B000A4T80O,"Don't let the title fool you!  This is not a ""fat burning yoga"" DVD.  Its a mindful, well-constructed practice.  The best part is that even though you are moving constantly - and sweating - it is paced so that you have enough time to breathe through each pose and reach your own correct form.

Every sequence consists of related poses - for example, seated easy to cobbler to modified boat - repeated three times, sometimes with an intensification.  The only pose that repeats from sequence to sequence is downward dog, which is ideal.  There is a nice mix of prone, seated, standing, and twisting poses.  The first time I did it, my back felt like someone had rolled the kinks individually out of each muscle.

Rodney Yee produces DVDs without distracting props or music and his instruction is always clear and concise.  He knows the limits of practicing from a recording. He's not trying to overcome them by spouting cliches or tortured metaphors, just trusting that the practice itself, done well, will help you clear your mind and center yourself.  I haven't felt the need to switch to the music-only audio, but its nice to know I can once it's memorized.

If you are an absolute beginner, start with something more basic and come back to it.",1285977600,6,1246,4.695852534562212
2358631,5,B000A4T80O,"This is a moderate yoga workout that flows well and leaves me feeling very stretched and relaxed.  I have tried many yoga dvds, and this is my favorite.  A good beginner-intermediate transition, or when you want to do what I call ""active relaxation.""  I am a runner, and I often use this to stretch out the day following a long run.

2358632,4,B000A4T80O,"The title ""Yoga Burn"" is a bit of a misnomer. I probably would have given it five stars otherwise.  While there are some challenging moves in the beginning such a slow chair pose, the remainder was a slow, mindful, and meditative practice.  If you are looking for something like Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste where you hold the pose for at least five breadths, this is not it.  However, the repetition of slow movements (3xs each) allows for bringing circulation into that area of the body, and you find you are able to get a little deeper each time.  I love watching him as I'm doing the yoga.  It feels like Rodney is just flowing with the movements-a very intuitive practice.  This was a nice spin on the usual vinyasa where sometimes you flow in and out of poses too quickly.  Sometimes a position feels so good you just want to stay there and ""feel the sweetness of it""--if that is what you are looking for this is the video for you.  This was a nice change of pace and I really enjoyed it.  I will use this after doing weights, or other workouts for a beautiful and mindful stretch.",1284422400,4,1087,4.395
2358633,5,B000A4T80O,"I was reading through the many reviews of this DVD and realized that I've actually owned Yoga Burn for about 2 years and never used it! I think what happened was I bought Yoga Burn at the same time I bought Yee's Advanced Yoga DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodney-Yee-Advanced-Yoga/dp/B000BYW6Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodney Yee - Advanced Yoga</a>.  It took me all of 2 minutes of previewing the Advanced DVD to stop it and put it away.  I put the Burn DVD on the shelf with it, assuming that it would be equally difficult; they'd been collecting dust together ever since!

But reading the other reviews recently made me realize that I can probably do the Burn DVD, so I pulled it out and tried it (the Advanced Yoga DVD is still collecting dust, and will probably be for many years to come). Now that I've tried the Burn DVD, I understand what the debate is about, and I think I can help bring some clarity for those who are wondering if they should purchase it.

1. For those who are afraid it will be too difficult: this DVD CAN be done by beginner-level folks!! The entire DVD is comprised of basic poses. The difficulty only comes from having to hold them for a longer period of time. As you practice, you will gain strength, flexibility, and the agility you will need for transitioning from pose to pose. If it's too difficult at first, just do as much as you can and you will eventually do the whole thing with purpose, integrity, and grace.

2. For those who are afraid it will be too easy: ok, I may not be the MOST fit person in the world.  But I'm fit enough to do Rodney Yee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B0000A2ZQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga - Total Body Workout</a>&nbsp;or Shiva Rea's Fire Practice without collapsing! If this DVD is practiced with purpose and you INTENTIONALLY use the muscles that the poses are designed to target, you will not be able to help but feel a burn.  Now, exactly how MUCH burn will depend on your fitness level, but there's no way you won't generate some heat.

3. For those who are afraid there won't be enough instruction: Yee explains during the introduction that the main focus of this DVD is in the slow, purposeful TRANSITIONING from one pose to the next.  I take this to mean that people who purchase this video (even beginner-level folks) should already be somewhat familiar with basic poses as well as with how to breathe.

If you are not familiar with basic poses and breathing, then you should also purchase Yoga for Beginners (Patricia Walden's DVD is an exceptional source of basic instruction&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B000067D1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Beginners</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Journal-Yoga-Practice-for-Flexibility/dp/B00008G76V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Journal - Yoga Practice for Flexibility</a>).  But don't let that stop you from purchasing Yoga Burn.  Once you're confident with the poses and breathing, you can pop in the Burn video when you're in the mood for a good, extremely low-impact workout that will improve your strength, flexibility, and mindfulness.

4. For the folks who are afraid it will be boring: I'm not a big Dr. Phil fan these days, but I agree with him when he says that ""bored people are usually BORING people.""  If you're getting too used to ANY video that you practice, just make a choice to spice it up!  Creative folks who are very familiar with a DVD and its poses will naturally begin to alter the poses to make them more advanced or more interesting.

Of course, I can't speak for anyone else, but I myself did not find this one boring.  Actually it was a welcome (albeit temporary) break from my ongoing (and ever-intensifying) love affair with Shiva Rea&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiva-Rea-Daily-Energy-Vinyasa-Flow-Yoga/dp/B002IVLWCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiva Rea: Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiva-Rea-Yogini/dp/B00331RHAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiva Rea: Yogini</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Shakti/dp/1591791847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Shakti</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiva-Rea-Fluid-Power-Vinyasa-Flow-Yoga/dp/B000KGH03E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiva Rea - Fluid Power - Vinyasa Flow Yoga</a>.

2358634,4,B000A4T80O,"I think Yoga Burn is really good. I didn't give it a 5 starts because I would like it to be a little more challenging, maybe more repetition and more abs, but I guess that's why they made a Yoga Abs :P
This one really works though, it has tone my body rather quickly, and it is good for people that is returning to work out after being off for awhile.",1279843200,,351,3.9577464788732395
2358635,5,B000A4T80O,"I've had this dvd for the past four years. I haven't practiced yoga in a year or so because life just got very busy. However, I decided to start practicing again today and went back to this dvd. After four years, this is still one of my favorite yoga dvds. The poses are simple enough for beginners, but still a good work out for intermediate students. Since it is a slow pace you have to hold your poses longer, which means build more control over your muscles.

The poses you need to know are simple beginner's poses: downward dog, warrior poses, boat pose, chair pose, forward bend, staff, single leg staff, etc.

Right now, my muscles are complete jello, and I have a feeling they will just be sore tomorrow. SO instead I will do a combination of 1 session of AM Yoga for your week (also Rodney Yee) and the Beginner's Yoga (also by Rodney Yee) tomorrow and go back to Yoga Burn the day after. My goal is to work my way back up to Power Yoga (also by Rodney Yee) which is a lot harder workout.",1279670400,,997,4.26984126984127

2358637,3,B000A4T80O,"I read a review that said a beginner could do this tape. Not true unless you are very flexable or a contortionist. Rodney Yee is a master that has been doing yoga for over twenty years. He is truley great. This tape is way past my ability, I just started doing yoga and I am not flexiable enought for this work out.",1278374400,,315,4.096774193548387
2358668,5,B000A4T80O,"In Yoga Burn Rodney Yee takes standard yoga poses and slows them down to a fluid and graceful flow. Each move is done three times and then flows into the next position.  Now don't get me wrong, slow and precise does not mean easy; when you are slowing down repetitions where your core (abs) are engaged you are building some mighty strong muscles, and you do feel it.  This dvd was excellent.  I felt like the poses were well chosen for the workout: chair poses, forward bends, bridge, triangle, seated twists, boat pose, bow pose among other others.  I felt very loose and relaxed when I finished this dvd and felt like I had a good practice.  My mind felt calm and my muscles felt loose and well worked.

I do yoga a couple times a week along with many types of exercises and would consider myself an intermediate practitioner.  Though the dvd states beginner to advanced, I would recommend watching the dvd all the way through if you are an absolute beginner and don't feel like you have to go as deeply into the poses if you are not quite there with your flexibility.  I started with very elementary dvds for practice at home first so that I had practiced quite a bit before moving on.  I would say this would be perfect for intermediate and above as you are already familiar with the poses and already know how to flow from one pose to the next.

The instruction is calming with light instrumental music in the background that is pleasant and never distracting.

I enjoy yoga by Bryan Kest, Alan Finger, Sara Ivanhoe and Shiva Rea among others and liked the idea of getting something a little different with my practice.  I felt much like I do when I practice Pilates-I felt that due to the slow and precise movement I worked my body very efficiently.

An excellent addition to your home yoga practice!",1276214400,2,1807,4.506134969325154

2358670,3,B000A4T80O,"This is where all of Rodney Yee's videos are lacking: thorough explanation of the correct form. This video has the option to modify the video to be played with more explanation or with simple leading through the poses. This is of interest to those who want less coaching in their videos. I am a novice to the Yoga fad, but so far I am very happy with what I have experienced the more I practice. I have only had the opportunity to use videos, so I have much to learn regarding the correct way to perform a pose or movement. Rodney Yee, in another Gaiam video, was my first taste of Power Yoga and I found it very refreshing and invigorating but at only 20 minutes, something of a warmup. As I progressed to other videos I found that greater instruction and explanation of the poses helped me progress quicker and allowed for more effective Yoga sessions even with Rodney's videos.
Additionally even compared to the 20 minute video, I feel there isn't sufficient enough ""heat"" or warmth created in the muscles before the stretching. This video's real benefit is in improving flexibility. It is a calm and meditative session in stretching. Unfortunately it is difficult to get the most of this because of the lack of the muscle warmth to start.
I recommend this for experienced yogis who want to improve flexibility.",1273968000,2,1314,4.643776824034335

I like that for some moves you hold for a bit and for some you flow through the practice building up heat (hence the title Yoga Burn).  The moves start out easier and get harder as you go along.  I think that all levels will benefit from this practice. Some moves may be difficult at first, depending on your strength and flexibility.

2358673,4,B000A4T80O,"I am fairly new to yoga and purchased this DVD after watching a trailer for it. I was very excited by the thought of slow and coordinated movements to strengthen my body. I feel this DVD does achieve that. In the first segments, you get through these really tough downward facing-dog exercises that really made me sweat and feel the burn. The emphasis on the breathing is very helpful and I was able to focus on that rather than my body struggling through. :o) The flow and gradual movement throughout this DVD is phenomenal and made this DVD a worthy purchase.

The only complaint I have about this DVD is that in the first part, say about 20-30 minutes, you can really feel the burn and I was sweating through it. Then the rest of the DVD kind of just fizzles out with the exercises. Rodney Yee goes through some seated floor bends that just really didn't do it for me. On a side note though, I did see a video that recommended using wrist weights when you progress for this DVD. I haven't tried that avenue yet, but I think that will help ease my qualms about the last part of this DVD. Overall great DVD and would recommend to anyone just starting yoga. I don't think that someone in the advanced stage of their level in yoga would receive much benefit with this DVD. The poses are in the beginner to intermediate level of yoga in my opinion and I not sure if it would keep a higher level interested.

2358702,5,B000A4T80O,"This 60 minute routine is a powerful and mindful yoga practice. The poses are all done slowly and with continuous movement then repeated several times. The sheer slowness trains the mind to be `present' so you will definitely feel the burn.

YOGA BURN is different then Rodney Yee's other practices and I really enjoyed this workout as I found myself getting into the zone because of its slow, meditative and almost hypnotic quality (the great ambient music helped too) Some of the poses are quite advanced but I think the really challenging part is the length of time the poses are held and the repetition (most sequences are done 2 to 3 times each.)

For a change this has been filmed indoors and Rodney looks better than ever as he gives us flawless voice instruction from a raised wooden platform. The audio is available with 2 different options; Full or minimal instruction (which is a great feature)

I think complete beginners will need more instruction and modifications than are available here and I did find some of the moves quite advanced. Rodney also claims that this sort of practice will boost your metabolism and I can vouch for that as I was starving halfway through.

And so it was with some trepidation that I popped in Rodney Yee's ""Yoga Burn"" DVD - something about the title jangled a bit.

Fortunately, this hour-long workout DVD is flat-out solid.  Like all the Rodney Yee productions, the workout is polished and precise.  Yee narrates his workout in voice-over while he silently goes through the poses.  The stage has an attractive temple quality, and while there is some music in the soundtrack it never rises above the level of mild background noise.  And Yee never gets new-agey or overly-spiritual like other yogis.

The workout is flat-out tremendous.  Yee puts you through a full-body workout that focuses on repetition and control.  Prepare to move slowly from pose to pose - this slow pace is more pronounced early, but it is a recurring theme throughout the video.  By focusing on holding positions and controlling movement, ""Yoga Burn"" earns its name.

The workout starts out slowly with some lower-body stretches (staff pose, cobbler's pose, etc.), gradually moves to some strengthening positions (lots of downward dog transitioning to leg lifts, baby cobras, lunges, etc.), moves to some extensive hamstring and lower-back work, and finishes with some bridge poses and general cool-down.  Yee keeps things moving, and while you repeat most poses three times, he has a couple of one-off poses that prevent monotony from setting in over the course of the hour.

All in all, this is an excellent foundation yoga workout for your week.  Highly, highly recommended.",1237420800,4,1669,5.062271062271062

2358745,5,B000A4T80O,"I picked up this DVD at Target for 15 bucks and I really like it. All my other Yoga DVDs feature women as instructors, and I was nervous that a man instructor would focus too much on strength moves. I don't know how that applies to Rodney's other DVDs, but in this one he only does easy beginner poses.

The key is, he does each pose in a set of three. You do the moves slowly, which took me awhile to actually DO, as I am used to each pose at the speed I have been already doing them.

I did not feel much of a 'burn', but i did feel a definite heat in my core during the hour-long workout. I honestly felt GREAT - my blood was nice and warm and I felt very strong. So maybe this is the kind of burn that is referred to, instead of the typical aerobics burn of using a muscle group until fatigue. This DVD is not like that at all, even though it's what I was expecting.

Some of his sequences were very fluid and creative - I liked his warrior vinyasa, for example. And some of his forward bends really encouraged my body to loosen to a far greater extent than I had done previously. I found the repetition of each pose (the three times) to be boring at first. Then I noted that each time I repeated the pose I was able to go significantly further into the stretch.

I did not find that much strength was needed in the hour, but then, I like downdogs and planks. There are also some updogs halfway through that got exhilarating/tiring, but one can always replace them with cobras if needed.

Rodney has a very nice yoga instructional voice. Soothing. He does not talk too much - the instruction is just enough, as long as you know what each pose is named (he uses the English terms). Rodney is also enjoyable to look at.

The setting is quite nice - set in a yoga studio - some kind of very cool Zen one. There are rice screens behind him; he is on a bamboo floor platform, and the platform is set above a Zen rock garden. The beige sand is raked around the rocks like one would expect. Very peaceful to look at, with some Zen-like, low music in the background that does not distract.

I found the DVD a bit sparse in options. No matrix or sections to choose from - you just start the program and an hour later you are done. So if you don't have that much time, you'd have to do only a part of this DVD from the beginning, or fast forward to another section and go from there.

There is an intro by Rodney that i still need to watch. There is a choice of playing the hour with less instruction - ie, just voice prompts. The full-on instructional option is not for novices, however. Rodney assumes you have some experience and can follow along by going into downdog, boat, warrior one and two, etc, without having to be told anything about them. He provides no postural tips or even breathing assistance. I think at one point he reminds us to breathe and relax our faces, and that's all we get. I would have liked more direction about when to breathe in and out, myself.

So this DVD would be good for experienced beginners and for intermediates looking for an easy burn. Anyone expecting any arm balances, pigeons or wheel poses won't find them here. I assume for that we'd have to buy his Intermediate Yoga DVD. I actually probably will at some point!",1213228800,6,3253,4.233870967741935
2358746,3,B000A4T80O,"The concept sounded interesting and challenging. The thought of completing a vinyasa in very slow, continuous movements sounded quite a feat! I'm not a beginner in yoga, but not advanced either - by no means. I have to say that my favorite aspect in yoga is its physical challenge. This DVD focuses more on the spiritual/relaxation part. It's an hourly practice of power yoga, which requires that you go through the movements very slowly and mindfully, and repeats the poses about three times each. The premise is that you work harder and concentrate deeper on the experience, the breathing and the pose.

I must say that it didn't do it for me. Maybe because I'm used to Ashtanga yoga, which is more intense and structured, I found that the poses Yee put together for this practice were unchallenging as a whole. Some very easy seated poses are repeated again and again, and I must admit it got tedious. I didn't even break out a sweat, and although I hadn't done any yoga for months I didn't feel the slightest soreness the next day. That's not what happened when I did Yee's Total Body Power Yoga practice - in contrary, I found it challenging and invigorating. So, my advice would be if you're looking for a power yoga practice that's not so physically challenging; that takes you slowly over the movements; that will focus on your mental concentration, then you will enjoy this practice. However, if you want something more intense then go for the 'Total Body' DVD.",1206921600,7,1470,4.719844357976654

I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. I found this dvd to be too advanced, and was left unable to do the next pose only 10 minutes into it (he was folding in half!!!). There is no explanation of the poses, and I had to watch and then rewind to see what I was supposed to do next. I gave the dvd 3 stars, because I have enough understanding to know that if I was more advanced, this might be a great dvd. I do appreciate how Yee goes into and out of each pose in repetition, creating a total workout.

2358762,4,B000A4T80O,"Sobepeace 8/21/06 wrote a great review & the poses he names are all Rodney does. There aren't a lot of poses in this 50 min practice w/a 4 minute relaxation mediation due to the fact he moves slow in/out & during each pose & there is repetition for every pose. He moves about 1/4-1/2 speed the whole time & each pose is done 2-4x each either again & again or in a sequence. Normally I hate repetition, but with Rodney's good energy/awareness, I was able to do it, I would also do a more advance version of what he was doing or else instead of in/out as he does, I would hold the pose the whole time. At first I started to FFW, because I was anxious to do something else besides workout before it got too late, but with Rodney, I didn't want to. The music is very slow/minimal which I usually don't like, but it fits with the slow pace & once I got my racing mind to relax with the repetitive down dog, single leg down dog, knee to nose, then w/addition of a lunge repetition & then warrior series, that tired me out a bit. The only thing I'd wish is that instead of doing any poses more then 2x, he'd add more poses. I do enjoy the pace, but I think it would have been better served with that. Since I have good body awareness, I was able to do my own stretches or additions sometimes when he did repetitions that I felt compelled to do that moment, which I'm sure he would be glad that people would do. I have to admit, I felt intense soreness for two days after doing this. Rodey's body awareness really inspires you to push yourself as well & you're never bored.
The production quality from GAIAM is great as usual, Rodney voice overs as always, you can choose the minimal instruction w/pose name or choose him only saying the pose names alone. Considering that lack of detailed instruction, this is not for yoga newbies, but intermediate beginners or advanced beginners & beyond. Those more advanced can use it as a light day or for slower, more forced body conscious practice.

There are TWO trailers on youtube under ""Gaiam Yoga Burn"" submitted by GAIMSEARCH which is the same video they use on their site gaiam com",1200355200,4,2121,4.342569269521411
2358763,3,B000A4T80O,"I've been practicing classical ashtanga yoga for 2 years now, and recently purchased this DVD as an at-home alternative to class.  While very, very different from what I'm used to, I did find it to be okay.  I have utmost respect for Rodney Yee as a yogi.  He does a beautiful job instructing and his voice is calm and soothing, which aids in staying focused and moving slowly, which is what this DVD is all about.  He also doesn't yammer on about a lot of spiritual and new-agey stuff like other instructors do, which makes it great for people who do yoga purely for physical purposes (I'll note that I am NOT one of those people and am very spiritual with my practice, but I certainly understand not wanting to listen to someone's spiritual views while you're trying to get a workout!)

I also purchased Rodney Yee's ""Power Yoga: Total Body Workout.""  I will most definitely use that one more often.  Both are not as challenging as I'd like, but after the first time through the DVDs I noticed that there are poses that Rodney did in the practice that have more challenging variations that I am familiar with, so next time through I'll alter my practice a bit.  So for more experienced yogis, while this DVD may be a little dull, push yourself and pay attention and tweak this practice to make it a little more challenging.  You can't always rely on a DVD to give you every single variation on every single pose to fit your specific wants.  So do a little homework, watch the DVD through w/o practicing and see if you can find some alternatives.

Also, I do want to mention that for people who do asana as a part of their yogic spirituality, this DVD's slow pace is GREAT for stilling your mind and keeping focus!

One qualm I do have with this practice is: ""WHERE IS THE BREATH????""  I'm used to having my postures follow my breathing, but in this unique practice wouldn't work that way.  I tried to figure out some way of breathing throughout this practice, but halfway through I just stopped thinking about breathing and just did the postures.

As far as the difficulty level goes, no- I do not suggest this for very new beginners.  If you are new to yoga but in pretty good shape, go for this DVD, or if you've been practicing for a few months and understand basic alignment and such, go for it.  Also, keep into consideration what TYPE of yoga you practice before buying a DVD.  A beginners Power Yoga DVD might be quite challenging for someone who's been practicing gentle Hatha or Iyengar yoga for any amount of time.  It's all in what you're used to.  (Believe me- I found that out after my first Bikram class!)  If you've been practicing power, ashtanga, Bikram, jivamukti, or any sort of vinyasa yoga for a year or more, don't bother with this DVD if you're looking for something to simulate your everyday class.",1199577600,13,2824,4.519685039370079
2358764,5,B000A4T80O,"This is a great addition to the home practice for me.  I have been practicing for a year now, taking a weekly class and then using DVD's for home practice.  YogaBurn has the option of full instructional narration or just pose cues.  Since I'm still more of a beginner, I find the full instruction very helpful.  The slower pace allows me to get a better workout and not just quickly go through the poses as some of the other Rodney Yee DVD's.  I highly recommend YogaBurn for beginner and intemediate levels.",1199145600,,508,4.538461538461538
2358765,5,B000A4T80O,"It took a few times through before I got the hang of this style.  You don't get into a pose and then wait for an instruction to switch to another pose.  Instead, you are supposed to move very slowly from pose to pose so you are in constant slow motion.  Once I got the hang of that, I really enjoyed it a lot.  I feel it is a very gentle way to improve core strength.

The set and music are pleasing.  Yee is alone on a platform in a room that looks like a giant Zen sandbox (somehow, that does seem to work).

I wouldn't recommend this video for a complete beginner, because the instruction is minimal.  For example, he says ""Warrior II"" and that's it, you need to know how to get into Warrior II on your own.  Most of the poses are beginner level poses, though.  I'd say the hardest ones (for me at least) are Bow Pose and Upward Plank Pose.

There are actually two audio tracks on this, one with instruction (though it is limited), and one with no instruction, just a statement of the pose name.

There is a lot of emphasis on downward dog/plank poses, so if you have wrist issues that could be a problem.  I found that using small (chilren's) blocks or sponges under my palms helped keep my wrists comfortable.",1198886400,9,1214,4.248908296943231
2358766,5,B000A4T80O,"Great DVD. Some parts of the workout are challenging, and I like that. I've never had a lot of upper body strength, so this DVD is very good for building it. Also, I have very tight, inflexible muscles, so this workout is perfect for just starting out in yoga. I really enjoy the routine and asanas and feel great afterward. I like it so much that I go through it twice in a row each day I do it. I find that I can perform the stretches and asanas better the 2nd time around. The poses are basic, as others have stated, but if you are a beginner or have issues with inflexibility, lower back pain, shoulder and neck pain, etc. and are looking for a way to begin healing yourself, this DVD is terrific for that. I can already see the results in my legs and upper body, and I've done it only twice (actually, 4 times because I do the routine 2 times in a row for each workout). I also practice Bikram yoga, and I find this DVD to be a good compliment to Bikram. Before using the Yoga Burn DVD, I was very shaky with some Bikram asanas and didn't have a lot of strength or flexibility. After going through this routine 4 times, I'm much stronger, more flexible, and have better balance to perfomr the Bikram asanas.

While Yoga Burn does not necessarily make you sweat this is a real workout if you concentrate and wonderful for posture and increasing flexibility. You feel the workout in your legs, arms and abdomen for the next few days. Instructions are easy to follow if you are familiar with basic yoga poses. The only thing problem is he doesn't focus on breathing so you need to remind yourself or be very conscious of breathing through the poses.

or those lacking upper body strength. I've been doing yoga on and off for years and began again this summer.  I like my yoga slow and meditative and have no interest in Power Yoga.  I have enjoyed Rodney's AM Yoga, Yoga for Meditators and Yoga for Relaxation but decided to push myself with this DVD. For me, it was not just challenging, but impossible to do it all.  As a 56-year-old woman, I have not yet developed my upper body enough to handle the down dog, plank, cobra sequence through a number of repetitions, but it certainly gives me something to strive for--I also find the stress on my wrists something I need to deal with.  I was more comfortable with the sitting poses, though I certainly can't fold in two like Rodney.  If you are a strong beginner, I would still recommend that you learn the correct form for these poses through some of the other tapes, because doing them wrong at this intensity can be harmful.",1189987200,11,1086,5.177142857142857

It's slow and allows my body to follow the sequence even if I am still a bit stiff from the night, also given its meditative quality it's great to start your mind for the day to come.

2358782,5,B000A4T80O,"I disagree with the reviewers who state that this workout is easy. The slowness and repetition of each pose 3 times makes this a challenging workout in my opinion. Frankly, I have difficulty imagining how anyone could find it easy.

Here are some points which I would like to highlight:
- The moves/poses are all done in slow motion. This not only adds challenge, but it also helps in learning the moves and building ""mindfulness.""
- The workout is about 1 hour, so I tend to use it more on weekends or days off. During the week I tend to use Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Strength or Flexibility (which are shorter and, in my opinion, easier than Yoga Burn).
- It is a combination of strength building and stretching, followed by a 5-to-10 minute meditation at the end.
- Most of the poses are repeated 3 times, but with variation, increasing in difficulty.

Since I started practicing yoga about 6 months ago, my lower back pain has decreased dramatically. I have an office job, so I must sit at a desk for long periods of time during the week; this DVD is a welcome counterbalance to that. I only wish that I had discovered yoga a little sooner!

March 2009 update: I just did this video tonight for the umpteenth time and still find it very rewarding. It is one of the few exercise videos that both provides a great workout and leaves me with a sense of calm. I like to do this one when I get home from work.",1187654400,8,1410,4.374045801526718

It's hard to relax into a forward bend when he tells me to ""feel like my toes are buds about to open""!  Yoga Burn, on the other hand, has little ""chatter"", and sticks to basic instructions which let you focus on what you're doing.
The poses are familiar, without being boring.  It's beginner accessible, but challenging enough for an intermediate practitioner. It's also a great workout: by moving slowly and consciously through the poses, you can't rely on momentum to push you through.  There's less of a tendency to hold the breath, too.
The setting is serene without making me jealous--no Hawaian tropical settings with crashing waves in the background, or mountain scenery to distract.  The music is relaxing without making me want a nap.

Rodney Yee takes his viewer step by step through each of the poses. His directions are easy to follow and clear. It's clear from watching him how to do the poses. I watched the DVD first before trying it. The poses looked so easy that I thought I wouldn't get a good workout; however, when I did the exercises, I found I was sweating within 10 minutes. Admittedly some of the poses are difficult for me, but I do my best. I've found that each time the challenging poses are a little easier.  I like that the poses are done slowly; the stretch and burn revitalize me. A side benefit is that my posture is getting better. Maybe it's all the stretching?

I'm not into power yoga nor am I much of an athlete.  As someone who's been doing yoga for about one year, I find this a good workout: not too intense and not too easy.  Just right (for me).

Other reviewers say the moves are VERY slow, but I don't think they are.  In total contrast to the other reviewers, I wish it was even slower.  But this is how I like to do yoga.  I feel I should stress that: this is how I like to do yoga.

The reason I wrote that sentence twice is because I think reviews of ""workouts"" are HIGHLY subjective.  Many people write how good this or that DVD is without mentioning that it's to their taste.

I have purchased more than a few yoga and dance DVDs that I simply do not like because of things like the music or the instructors' voice.

I like this DVD on all levels.  I like the gentle new-age music.  I like the sound of Rodney Yee's voice.  I like that it doesn't feel or sound like a ""workout"". What it looks like, I haven't really noticed, and I really don't care about that, because I usually just listen.

However, for someone who has been practicing Yoga for at least a year, you will want to find something much more challenging.  I was disappointed that my body did not even warm up - I didn't ""feel the burn"", and spent the work out as cold as if I were sitting on a couch doing absolutely nothing.

2358808,5,B000A4T80O,"This is a beautiful, mindful, and potentially powerful yoga practice. It is true that there are no big surprise poses in this sequence--all are well-known, fairly basic level poses. The main audio option contains some instruction, but mostly about moving into and out of the poses; there is not much about alignment within the pose. Complete beginners may need more instruction and modifications than available here. The other audio option omits instruction at all, containing only prompts for moving from one pose to another.  The basic poses, simple instruction, and deemphasis on speed makes this dvd a good place for advanced beginners who have some knowledge of the poses to deepen their understanding of them, and for anyone, irrespective of level, to work on the mindful awareness aspect of their yoga practice.

The intensity in this dvd comes, not from speed or difficulty of poses, but from deep, slow, conscious repetition of fundamental asanas, with the time to build awareness of movement into, within, and out of them. Yoga is not meant to be a purely physical activity. The awareness aspect of yoga is rightfully considered advanced practice, and the familiar poses presented here allow the mind to take precedence. The point is not merely physical endurance (though, if done right, this sequence will also challenge the body in that way). The purpose is at least twofold: physically, to develop long and lean muscle through slow repetition of simple postures, and mentally, to use the simplicity of the poses as a platform for developing presence and awareness with each pose. Yoga is, after all, about the mind-body connection, and this practice aims at allowing the time and space for working on this crucial element. For those ready to move their yoga practice beyond the physical dimension while still developing the body, this is a lovely practice dvd.

The asanas are presented in small cycles of three poses or so with about three repetitions each, so it is hard to present an exact sequence, but here is a list of poses, roughly as they appear in the practice: Staff, Flying Crossed Legged Pose, Cobbler, Half Boat, Boat, Simple Crossed Leg Twist, Cat, Down Dog, Plank, Cobra, Single-legged Down Dog, Triangle, Warrior 2, Standing Forward Bend, Chair, Standing Side Stretch, Warrior 1 and 2, Low Lunge with backbend, Low lunge with hands in reverse prayer, Bow, Cobbler with forward bend, Head to Knee forward bend, Wide Angle forward bend series, Seated Forward Bend, Back Stretch, Reclined Bent Knee Twist, Bridge, Reclined Leg Stretch, Reclined Crossed Leg to Chest, Corpse.",1156118400,204,2601,5.086651053864169
2358809,4,B000A4T80O,"The first few times I did this video, I was focusing on the poses and didn't really feel the burn. It all felt too slow-mo, compared to Bryan Kest's power yoga videos. But at about the sixth time I did the video, I ""slowed down"" even more, and realised that the slower you do the poses, the more difficult they become, and the more burn there is. Which made it quite strange cos now, my practises on this video feel alot more difficult than the first few times I did it. It could be all in the mind. But as Yee proposes in this video, it is all about ""mindfulness"". So for those who don't seem to feel any ""burn"", how about trying it this way - do it even more slowly, be in the present and focus fully on what you're doing, and on the sensations, and maybe you'll start feeling it - which I did, in my arms and thighs!",1156032000,19,819,4.061728395061729
2358810,3,B000A4T80O,"I disagree with one of the spot lighted responses about the dvd being too easy and just for beginners. I have been doing yoga for 3 years (mainly Rodney Yee's Yoga for the Athlete - with is slow and steady) I tend not to like Power Yoga, but find myself to be fit and athletic.

I found all the Downward Dogs in the beginning with repeated leg lifts, leg twists, and knee to chin exercises to be VERY DIFFICULT! I didn't find myself warmed up enough to do those (maybe I am just a whimp!!)  I even got a terrible migraine and a dizzy spell from doing those (which has never happened before doing yoga). It takes a lot of upper body strength and endurance that may be difficult for the beginner.  Those exercises may have fit in better in the middle of the workout, as one is more warmed up. It just felt too forced in the beginning. The rest of the DVD was easier, so the flow was a bit off.  Still was an okay workout with a good stretch.

I tend not to use Yoga Burn very much because of the dreaded downward dog beginning.",1154736000,11,1025,4.156565656565657
2358811,5,B000A4T80O,"I have some of Rodney Yee's other videos and I have to agree with everyone else that it is totally different. Most of the poses are repeated 3x which means the stretches actually are pretty beneficial and you advance further with each repetition. The first half contains the only ""burn"" part which is an extended downward dog with modifications; the rest is a nice wind down. I am pregnant and bought this with CRUNCH's pregnancy yoga video, I actually like this a lot better and other than the boat pose am able to do most of the poses just fine, and it's much more interesting and challenging than the pregnancy one. He is right, it is easier to focus on the breathing more when you do the poses slowly and they are done with a nice flow to them which is great.",1153440000,4,763,4.380281690140845
2358822,4,B000A4T80O,"In this dvd Rodney Yee changes things around somewhat.  He takes everything almost painfully slow.  This, however, I find a good thing.  He is not doing anything too terribly difficult, but it becomes a challenge because he is slowing everything down so that you are having to concentrate on making sure you are doing everything the right way.  It is also extremely relaxing, and a good routine to do if you do want to do a routine but at the same time are too tired to really do a more challenging routine.  Again, another good product put out by Rodney Yee, and worth checking out.",1148083200,13,583,4.514285714285714
2358823,5,B000A4T80O,"This video has taken my moment-by-moment awareness of my body to a new level.  I've been using Mr. Yee's Power Yoga videos for a couple of months now, and I am usually aware only of the parts of my body that hurt during each pose, or I'm mentally with my kids, or at work, or on household issues, etc.

My first few tries with this video seemed long and boring, until today.  Because of the slow pace of the work-out, I started to notice the sensations throughout all of my body, not just the parts that ached.  My mind emptied of anything else, and patiently started to experience the sensation of being fully inside my own skin.  This was a new experience.  I was very surprised when the tape was over-- the time flew by.

This tape does not substitute for the more active Power Yoga workouts, but it teaches an essential mindfulness without which I realize that I will not have full control over my weight.  I tend to eat more in response to my emotions than in response to my body.  The awareness of the body emphasized in this tape, is essential to changing that habit.

Thank you, Mr. Yee.",1146700800,33,1095,4.376237623762377
2358824,5,B000A4T80O,"I'm fairly new to yoga and was intrigued at doing a ""slow flow"" workout.  At worst I thought I would have a relaxing practice that I could alternate with a more vigorous workout. Yoga Burn surprised me! I'm finding that the more I get into the slow pace, work on mindfulness and detail the more I feel the ""burn"". I feel it in my abs and afterwards my upper arms feel like they have been really worked out. My chest also feels more open and free than it has in years. The key as Rodney says is keep it slow and keep your mind with it. Rodney ends the practice by saying ""Thank You"" ""Namaste"", I find myself saying ""No, thank you! Rodney"" for a great DVD!",1143504000,83,654,4.149606299212598
2358825,3,B000A4T80O,"I bought this video on the recommendation of two of my yoga students.  The video was good.  It was slower than most which is nice to see.  I did find that once you got to the final pose you were already moving out of it.  I will practice with this video in the future but probably save it for a day that I am feeling a little slower.

Rodney does have a nice soothing way of explaining the poses and of course he demonstrates beautifully.  If you do get bored with this video just sit back and enjoy the sight of Rodney Yee.",1141171200,6,524,4.038834951456311
2358826,2,B000A4T80O,"I use several of Rodney Yee's DVD's and really like them. I have found that the titles usually are on target, but not this time. I tried giving this one a chance, but I just don't like it, I find it so boring that I can't center on the activity. My mind wanders back to work yesterday, today and tomorrow.",1140912000,9,305,4.1
2358827,3,B000A4T80O,"No doubt Rodney Yee is a true yoga specialist, however, I did not find the title of this DVD to be true to its name.  At no time did this ""yoga burn"".  In fact I have added it to my DVD shelf of yoga DVD's for days when I need a gentle practice or am not feeling up to par.  I would classify this DVD as beginner and not let the title mislead you into thinking this DVD is physically challenging.",1140652800,6,396,3.8641975308641974
2358828,5,B000A4T80O,"I really liked this DVD. I am a beginner to intermediate yoga practioner. One of my complaints with some other yoga dvd's is that they move too fast. This one really forces you to slow down and focus on the movements. Yoga was meant to be a way to prepare the body and mind for meditation. For me it was still a challenge. I liked the quiet music which was not too New-Agey, and Rodney does not prattle on about his philosophy or anything else that distracts from the poses. I felt very relaxed and grounded after this.",1138752000,14,519,4.3061224489795915
2358829,5,B000A4T80O,"I am not an advanced Yoga kinda guy, but I do practice Yoga to augment my other strength and cardio routines. Yoga is great for improving and maintaining flexibility and core strength. I have back problems and practicing Yoga helps me with that as well. I have several Yoga DVDs, with different instructors, which I rotate in my practice. My favorite has been Rodney Yee's ""Power Yoga-Total Body Workout"". ""Total Burn"" uses some of the same exercises, but at a slower pace which really does give a good...burn, especially in my abs and triceps. Some of my favorite exercises, like upward bow and warrior three, were not included in this practice, but if all of my favorites were included it would have been 90 minutes long not 60. I was looking for something that would give me a more focused stretch and ab workout and ""Total Burn"" does that. I would still recommend that someone who is interested in practicing Yoga, develop a library of various DVDs. Variety helps to round out your practice and maintain interest. The music is a bit loud, but that is the only thing I don't like about this DVD. Rodney Yee does indeed Rock.",1138492800,30,1127,4.64
2358830,5,B000A4T80O,"I've been practicing yoga on my own (no classes) for a little over a year. I decided to invest in a few yoga videos to keep me moving at a good pace and really improve my body's tone and muscle shape.

Rodney Yee is a master yogi. Through this DVD, watch Rodney move slowly from position to position creating a fat-burning series of yoga moves. His body is perfectly sculpted and toned, and watching him, I was able to make my body mimic his.

At first, the moves were not that difficult, and they did not ""burn"" but as the workout continued, my body began to really feel the positions and open up. At some point, I even began yelling back at Rodney, ""I've got it this time!"" I felt so proud that I was able to easily follow along through most of it, and when I couldn't get it right the first repition, the move was repeated for both sides 3 times until I had it down!

This is great for intermediate yogis, even beginners who have a knowledge of the positions! I would reccomend this and other Rodney Yee DVDs to anyone practicing yoga who wants a little bit more intense workout.",1137196800,29,1082,4.294117647058823
2358831,1,B000A4T80O,"This did absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  It is so slow, not to mention extremely easy to do.  Do not bother with this video if you have done yoga at all....it is very basic.",1135382400,13,183,4.055555555555555

Pros:

Vocal Instruction is clear and easy to understand
Choreography is great. Nice flow from pose to pose.
Cons:
Some of the moves are very difficult. I would not recommend this for a beginner.",1480636800,,337,4.451612903225806
