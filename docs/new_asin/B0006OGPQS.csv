8042044,5,B0006OGPQS,"This collection is a mixed bag of cartoons, dating from 1926 to 1960.
Starting off with two Mutt and Jeff selections: ""Slick Sleuths"" (1926), that was originally in b&w but rereleased (and shown here) in two-color Kromocolor, and in this one Mutt and Jeff try to catch the evil ""Phantom"", who is good at disguises (one of them is a cartoon Charlie Chaplin), and ""Westward Whoa"" (1926), where the fearless duo try to brand a bull. Created by Harry ""Bud"" Fisher, Mutt first appeared in print in 1907 as ""A. Mutt"" and was joined by Jeff in 1908. The early film cartoons were produced between 1913-1926 (usually animated by Raoul Barre and Charles Bowers), and were later continued through 1982, usually done by Al Smith. These two examples are roughly drawn and not that imaginative, but are interesting as part of cartooning history, as Mutt and Jeff were such long lasting characters.

Tracks # 3 and # 4 are ""biographical"", and from 1960. ""Robin Hood"" is narrated by John Rust and tells the story in a nice watercolor paint style. ""Christopher Columbus"" is in the same format and style, and perpetuates the myth that those in Columbus' time thought the world was flat.

# 5 is ""Cheese Burglar"" (1945), a violent but very funny escapade between a dog, a cat, and a hungry mouse. Herman the Mouse hides in a wine bottle, and all three end up very drunk.
# 6, ""Cupid Gets His Man"" (1936) is marvelous, as an army of cupids try to match up the unmatchable, and the stork assigns them offspring. The cupids have a hard time getting a ""W.C. Fields"" character, and a tough spinster (an Edna Mae Oliver type) together. This one is beautifully drawn, and directed by Tony Palmer.

# 7, ""The Big Bad Wolf"" (1936 ?) is fabulous, with dancing animals, and a very bad wolf. This is not the ""Big Bad Wolf"" and the pigs...he's after lambs this time. This is an example of the solo work of the great Ub Iwerks, the man who animated Mickey Mouse, after he split with Disney and signed with Powers.
# 8, ""The Henpecked Rooster"" (1944), is about a shrew of a hen, who sits around reading ""How to Lay an Egg"" by Bob Hope and eating candy corn, while she makes Mr. Rooster do the chores. Directed by Seymour Knietel, animated by Calpini and Grossman.
# 9 is ""The Three Bears"". No info on this one, except it is not the 1939 version. My favorite section is of the three-part staircase in the bear's house.

""Tulips Shall Grow"" (1942), is a puppetoon from George Pal, which led him to do ""Destination Moon"" in 1949. It is a fascinating anti-Nazi piece, about Jan and Jeanette, sweethearts in Holland, whose country is devastated by the Screwball Army. It has a lot of symbolism, incredible objects (the planes are made of glass, for instance), and is an amazing example of Pal's early work.
Total running time on this DVD is 63 minutes, and I give it 5 stars for historical value, and the rare gems that are included in this collection.",1115251200,5,2913,4.542857142857143
