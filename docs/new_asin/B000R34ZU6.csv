8198692,5,B000R34ZU6,I love this show! It's about corrupt cops and the lengths they go to keep themselves one step ahead of everybody else.,1389052800,,118,4.409090909090909
8198693,5,B000R34ZU6,This is one of the most entertaining shows I've come across in a while. It pushes some boundries as far as network standards go (In the same way NYPD Blue did in the early 90's),1204329600,,177,4.085714285714285
8198694,5,B000R34ZU6,"Easily the best show on TV.  Probably not gonna be topped, ever.  It's funnier than just about every sitcom in production, and grittier than any cop shows you've ever seen.  Non-stop action, drama, awesome lines- the works.  Imagine Bruce Willis's character from The Last Boyscout as the head of an elite detective squad who seemingly enjoys his job.  That was a poor attempt at selling it- my bad.  Awesome show!!  Enough said.",1200700800,,428,4.861111111111111
8198695,5,B000R34ZU6,"I GOT THIS FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS, AND HE LOVED IT.  IT CAME FAST, WELL PACKED AND I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.",1199664000,,106,3.8181818181818183
8198696,5,B000R34ZU6,"I was very satisfied with the product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and i recieved it in about a week.  The DVD's were protected in the package and were sealed just like brand new.  We put them in the DVD player and they all play perfectly, no skips or breaks in the DVD.  I was very satisfied with the product and would order something like this again.",1198972800,,361,4.188405797101449
8198697,3,B000R34ZU6,"The first season was hard hitting, new and something quite special, but after about three seasons of pretty much the same thing, it's as if the seasons have run together. Don't get me wrong, I love the show because it's so damn exciting, unfortunately, it never seems to change; thus, my conservative rating.",1197849600,,308,4.830188679245283
8198698,5,B000R34ZU6,"Buy this series! Tough, hard hitting, multi-dimensional characters, lots of tension and surprises. A must for any collection!",1196640000,2,125,6.0
8198699,5,B000R34ZU6,EXCELLENT DRAMA AND REAL...I DONT KNOW HOW THEY DO IT... BUT EA EPISODE IS PULSATING WITH DRAMA AND REALITY.  SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY IS VS SANITIZED NETWORK TV.  THIS AIRS ON A&E. CHECK THEIR WEBSITE TO FIND NEW SEASON AND OTHER DATA.,1189468800,2,236,4.465116279069767
8198700,5,B000R34ZU6,"I admit, I've just bought this set on here (today, 27th june) and I'm expecting it to be sent a day or two after its released and I cannot wait. buying this show in seperate cases will cost you a few extra dollars, but to be honest I could spare the $3 extra this set costs (at the time this was bought it was $169.99)

I've watched random episodes here and there and I have to say I love shows that are hard hitting like this one (oz is a perfect other example).

Will write a better review once I get the boxset.",1182816000,7,514,3.9805825242718447
