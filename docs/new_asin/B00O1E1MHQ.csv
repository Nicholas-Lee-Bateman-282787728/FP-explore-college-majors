8681413,4,B00O1E1MHQ,"A fun and energetic workout - only small complaint is that camera work does not always show the feet when the instructors are teaching a step, making it a little more difficult to pick up at first.  That said, LOVE the local music and fun fun fun workout!",1423440000,,255,4.3125
8681414,3,B00O1E1MHQ,"I ordered this because the ad on the radio gave the impression that is was a combination of HULA and zumba. Rest assured, there is no hula in this workout. If that's what you're looking for, don't buy it. As far as the music is concerned, it is recorded by Hawaiian musicians, but I would describe it as reggae, not ""Hawaiian"". If you are familiar with hip hop dance or zumba workouts, this could be an easy transition for you. I've done the hip hop abs workout and used the wii dance videos for years. I found this difficult to follow. There are places with complicated dance choreography and the camera angle is on the dancers torsos so there is no possible way for you to see what they are doing with their feet. They have the dancers dressed in three different colors that are supposed to reflect difficulty level, but I can see no discernible difference in what they are doing.  While it's not horrible, if I had the chance again, knowing what I know now, I would pass.",1422403200,2,974,4.411111111111111
